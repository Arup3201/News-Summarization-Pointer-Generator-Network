Nani could leave Man Utd for Juventus but will cost Serie A champions £12m

Tottenham are in talks with Hajduk Split over the transfer of talented young midfielder Andrija Balic.

Sporting director Franco Baldini has been in negotiations with the Croatian club over recent weeks and is looking to strike a deal for around £1.8million. However, Split want closer to £4.5m for the coveted 16-year-old who has already broken into their first team.

The shaggy-haired teenager often plays in a defensive role for his club and has appeared for Croatia U18s. He was watched by Tottenham scouts playing against England in March.

Highly rated: Tottenham are in talks with Hajduk Split over the signing of 16-year-old midfielder Andrija Balic

Wanted: Ajax, Borussia Dortmund and Marseille have all tracked Balic, with the Dutch having a £500k bid rejected

Ajax, notably, Borussia Dortmund and Marseille have also watched him closely with the Dutch champions having a £500,000 offer rejected earlier in the season.

Split have already sold 19-year-old Mario Pasalic to Chelsea, who was loaned back, and are fending off bids for several other members of their young first team squad. Midfielder Josip Basic, 18, and Ivory Coast winger Jean Evrard Kouassi, 19, in particular, have been watched closely by Bundesliga and Premier League scouts recently.

Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid are stepping up interest in Tottenham misfit Roberto Soldado although the White Hart Lane club would still like to recoup the £26m they spent on signing him from Valencia last summer and that will prove difficult.

Liverpool look to steal a march on Man Utd and Man City for former Arsenal youngster Ejaria

Not content with stealing a march on Manchester United for Southampton's Adam Lallana, Liverpool are looking to beat their fierce rivals to teenager Ovie Ejaria.

The 16-year-old has been allowed to leave Arsenal despite being highly rated. United were keen to take him, as were Manchester City, but Liverpool have stepped in and the left-footed midfielder is keen to join them.

Ejaria has been with Arsenal since he was nine years old but figured as a trialist for Liverpool against Ajax recently and impressed coaching staff.

A few of Arsenal's promising young players are leaving this summer with central midfielder James Blanchfield having had a run out for Manchester United’s U18s while striker Olufela Olomola is poised to join West Ham United.

Players aged 16 are free to move unless they sign scholarship forms on July 1. Arsenal are understood to have made a strong pitch to Chris Willock to stay despite United's interest while Arsenal U18 striker Alex Iwobi, who is the nephew of former Nigeria captain Jay Jay Okocha, will sign a new two year contract this week.

Legal dispute over Everton defender Stones' representation

The representatives of John Stones have 
taken the first steps of legal action as the dispute over the Everton 
defender rumbles on.

Stones's representation deal with 
London-based Star-Management Signings is not due to expire until next 
year, however, Wasserman Media Group (WMG) have stepped in now to make 
the player an offer to join them instead.

Star-Management want to agree a contract extension with Everton so that England hopeful Stones trebles his wages.

They
 have looked after Stones since he was a 16-year-old at Barnsley with 
Georgina Lillis, daughter of former Manchester City striker Mark, his 
designated agent.

Sportsmail reported news of the dispute last month and that Chelsea have lined up a bid for the 20-year-old.

They are willing to offer £12m for a player Everton bought for just £3m in January 2013.

Arsenal
 also have an interest but don't believe Everton will sell and will not 
be drawn into any protracted negotiations. Manchester United also had 
interest under David Moyes who took Stones to Goodison.

Everton
 manager Roberto Martinez is fearful the off field dispute will affect 
Stones's performances and wants it resolved as quickly and smoothly as 
possible. Yet unless a suitable accord can be reached the case will be 
heading to court.

Aston Villa and Hull are showing interest in Augsburg's Kevin Vogt.

The blond 6ft 4in defensive midfielder is a Germany U21 international and has stood out this season as Augsburg built a solid defensive game and pushed for a mid-table position.

Former Norwich manager Chris Hughton sent scouts to watch Vogt earlier this year and Villa manager Paul Lambert has had decent reports from scouts and friends in Germany. The 22-year-old would cost around £2.5m.

Championship and League One clubs monitoring out-of-contract Elliott

Championship and League One clubs are taking a keen interest in veteran Wade Elliott.

The 35-year-old is out of contract at Birmingham City but has impressed while on loan at Bristol City where he played an integral part in the club's turnaround.

Manager Steve Cotterill, who joined City when they were second from bottom of League One, brought Elliott in on loan in January and they subsequently lost only three games to finish 12th in the division. Cotterill will be among those to consider Elliott in the summer.

Messi linked with £164m move to Man City in Spanish press

Manchester City have again been linked with Lionel Messi in today's Spanish press. Reports in AS say they are willing to spend £164million. City's interest in the Argentine is no secret, however, Barcelona have not agreed to sell and the player remains interested in the Spanish club's plans.

They are close to making him the best-paid player in the world with a new contract and will dispose of coach Tata Martino in the coming weeks. Luis Enrique is expected to replace him and that would suit Messi.

Manchester United and Paris St Germain have also made soundings over Messi's situation but he is likely to remain in Spain.

For City, they may have more joy in rivalling United for Cesc Fabregas instead.
