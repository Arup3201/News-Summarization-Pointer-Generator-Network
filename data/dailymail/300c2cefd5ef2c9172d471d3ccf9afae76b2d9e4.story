Khamenei posted a series of tweets over the past week. He used hashtags which sprung up following the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown and the chokehold death of Eric Garner including #BlackLivesMatter and #Ferguson. 

On Sunday, the leader tweeted: 'It's expected that followers of #Jesus follow him in his fight against arrogants and in his support for the oppressed. #BlackLivesMatter.'
