More than a quarter of rough sleepers in London are migrants from Eastern European countries that joined the EU in the past decade, figures reveal.

Counts found that new arrivals from Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic account for 28 per cent of rough sleepers in the capital.

Meanwhile, official England-wide statistics showed that the number of rough sleepers had risen by 37 per cent since 2010, as Britain has been gripped by a growing shortage of affordable housing.

The figures come amid concern that increasing numbers of rough sleepers from Romania and Bulgaria will put a strain on services offered by Britain's welfare state.

Citizens from the two countries gained the right to take up residence in the UK on January 1, but have so far not arrived in the numbers some had feared.

Notoriously, however, several camps have sprung up in high profile locations, such as the wealthy area around Marble Arch, in central London, which has become a frontline in the running battle between immigration officials and Eastern European migrants who sleep on the streets and beg or steal for a living.

Citizens of the EU who do not have a job and cannot support themselves are not allowed to live in Britain - meaning that officials can deport those who are unemployed and sleeping rough.

The problem of Polish rough sleepers in the London has become so bad that last year a homeless charity in the capital produced a Polish-language video warning of the dangers of moving to the city without a job or means to support themselves.

It advises Poles to ‘be well prepared’ if they are coming to Britain – with a guaranteed job and back-up money.

But it also shows dramatic and alarming images of a Polish immigrant, played by an actor, who loses his job and is then beaten up and burned while he is sleeping on the street.

Rough sleepers include people who are 'about to bed down ... or actually bedded down in the open air', said a report accompanying the data released today.

The steepest regional rises were seen in the East Midlands and the South East, areas housing campaigners say are particularly affected by high housing costs and austerity-inspired cuts to local services.

In London the total number of rough sleepers dipped slightly on last year's figure, but it nevertheless accounted for than a fifth of the national total.

'Case work statistics by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (Chain) found migrants sleeping rough in the capital were most likely to be Poles, accounting for one in every ten people sleeping outdoors.

That was followed by Romania, with 8 per cent, and Lithuania, with 3 per cent. In sum more than half the capital's rough sleepers were from overseas, figures showed.

Around 15 per cent hailed from countries outside Europe.

Rough sleeping counts and estimates split by London and the rest of England: In London the total number of rough sleepers has dipped slightly since last year, but it still accounted for than a fifth of the national total

While the number of rough sleepers in 
London dipped 3 per cent since the same period last year, elsewhere in 
the country saw big rises in the numbers living out on the streets.

In the East Midlands, 206 people were 
reported sleeping rough – a 50 per cent rise on last year, including 
increases of 96 per cent in Derby and 80 per cent in Northampton.

In
 the South East outside London, 532 people were reported sleeping rough –
 a 20 per cent rise on last year, including increases of 275 per cent in
 Slough and a 58 per cent in Oxford.

Other
 cities and regions showing significant rises were Bristol, where 41 
people were sleeping rough, up 356 per cent; Stoke-On-Trent, with 16 
people, up 700 per cent; Coventry, with 26, up 117 per cent; and 
Cornwall, with 77 people, up 54 per cent.

Homelessness charity Crisis said that 
many of those regions had seen deep cuts to local homelessness services.
 It said the numbers of rough sleepers was likely to rise thanks to a 
chronic shortage of affordable housing.

Leslie
 Morphy, chief executive of Crisis, said: 'This continued rise in rough 
sleeping is unacceptable – behind these statistics are more and more 
real lives being devastated by the traumatic experience of homelessness.

'The Government must take 
real steps to address the chronic lack of affordable housing and 
urgently consider the impact its cuts are having, particularly to 
housing benefit and local homelessness services.'

Rough sleeping rate by local authority: The steepest regional rises were seen in the East Midlands and the South East, areas campaigners say are particularly affected by high housing costs and cuts to local services

Rough sleeping counts and estimates are single night snapshots of the number of people sleeping rough in local authority areas.

Rough sleepers include people sleeping on the streets, in tents, doorways, parks, bus shelters or encampments, and also in buildings 'not designed for habitation', including stairwells, barns, sheds, car parks, cars, derelict boats, stations, or makeshift shelters made of cardboard boxes.

But the definition excludes homeless people staying in hostels or shelters, people camping at holiday campsites or on organised protests, squatters or travellers.

Overall the figures showed there were 2,414 rough sleepers in England in autumn last year, the latest period for which data is available.
