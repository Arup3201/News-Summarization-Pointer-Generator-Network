A campaign to encourage victims of sexual abuse to write love letters to themselves has gone viral - with hundreds of people taking part.

The initiative - #survivorloveletters - was started by artist Tani Ikeda, owner of ImMEDIAte Justice and a survivor of abuse herself, as an 'act of defiance' about her experiences.

Tani, who lives in LA, said the movement, which has seen the letters shared on social media websites, is a 'cathartic' way in which survivors of abuse can share their stories.

This letter is written by a woman called Sarah, she posted the colourful piece to herself on Valentine's Day as part of the #survivorloveletters project which was started by the artist Tani Ikeda 

The project was launched on Tumblr along with with feminist activist Suey Park so that the moving accounts could be shared with and read by other victims.

Tani started the initiative on Valentine's Day as it is the anniversary on the day she was abused.

Tani told Femail: '[The campaign] started on Valentine's Day and #Survivorloveletter was an act of defiance, a declaration of self love and a call to allies to honor the survivors in their lives.

'I imagined what it would mean for my younger self to wake up and read message after message of public support for surviving.

This letter was written to a woman named Andrea in it it says, 'I want you to know how proud I am of you for keeping your head up and your heart open to the beautiful things this world still has to offer'

'That's when I knew I wanted to create #survivorloveletter.I was incredibly grateful that activist Suey Park helped kick off #survivorloveletter on twitter and that Lisa Factora-Borcher, Patrisse Marie Cullors-Brignac, Amita Swadhin and other women I admire joined the conversation.'

Tani was abused herself and said: 'Growing up, I realised story was my most powerful weapon against violence, marginalization, and a media landscape that rendered me invisible.

'Story had the capacity to heal myself and break the stigma around being a survivor of sexual violence. 

'We didn't have to be ashamed about what had happened to us. We don't have to live the rest of our lives as victims.' 

This letter, written in green pen, said that it took this survivor a long time to come to terms with what had happened to them

Tani said she decided to set up the Tumblr initiative when she started to get a lot of submissions as she wanted a way to archive the letters. 

She said: 'At first, the letters were coming in mostly from family and friends, but now strangers are sending me their most intimate, painful, and brave survivor love letters. It's a real privilege to help facilitate this kind of sharing.

Tani told Femail that she hopes the project will help other survivors of sexual abuse to feel less alone.

This is a letter written to Tani, the woman behind the #survivorloveletters project, by one of her friends 

Tani said after a while she started to receive more letters and she decided to start the Tumblr account

She said: 'I hope that someone reading #survivorloveletter will feel a little less alone today.

'I hope that by sharing our complex stories of violence we will break down the stigma of shame around rape and start conversations that lovingly honor survivors.'

Some of the letters are written by the survivors themselves whilst others have been submitted by their friends or family. 

One letter written by a woman named Sarah said: 'Dear Sarah, you didn't ask to be here, but remember, you are not what they took from you. 

'You are the monument of survival and recovery you erected in its place. I love, and will always love, every healing part of you.

'You are a queen, you are a goddess, you are a survivor. Happy V-day. All my love and everything else, Sarah.' 

Another written by a man says: 'To the little five year old me: Just because they don't want to acknowledge boys get raped, doesn't make the right. Rape knows no gender.'  

This moving letter which has been created on a computer is from a man who had been raped as a child 

Some of the letters are from family members, such as this touching one written to a daughter from her father
