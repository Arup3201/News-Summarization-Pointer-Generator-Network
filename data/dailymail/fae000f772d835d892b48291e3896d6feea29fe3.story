Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has told goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois he wants him to stay at Stamford Bridge next season.

Sportsmail revealed last month how Mourinho would wait until after the Champions League final before discussing his future with the Belgian.

And the Blues boss has now contacted the highly-rated keeper to discuss his intentions for next season.

Keeper: Thibaut Courtois will be part of the first-team plans at Chelsea instead of returning to Atletico Madrid

Safe: Courtois smothers the ball during the Champions League final, which Atletico lost 4-1 to neighbours Real

After three successive seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid, Mourinho wants Courtois to return to the club next season to form part of his first-team plans.

Petr Cech has long been established as the Stamford Bridge club's first-choice goalkeeper, but the emergence of Courtois has placed question marks over his position.

The future of goalkeeper Courtois will be one of the key issues for Chelsea to resolve this summer.

The Belgian was expected to rejoin Atletico for a fourth season once he signed a new Blues contract.

There
 is a feeling among some members of the Blues hierarchy that Courtois 
would benefit from another 12 months at the Vicente Calderon before 
returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2015/16 season.

However, Mourinho wants Courtois to return to west London next season to compete with Cech for the No 1 jersey.

Staying: The future of the highly-rated Courtois is on the list of priorities for Chelsea this summer

Fight: Petr Cech has long been Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper but must fight for his place with Courtois

Decisions: Jose Mourinho (right) must choose between Petr Cech (left) and Courtois next year

Courtois is settled in the Spanish capital and would happily stay with Atletico for another season.

After establishing himself as one of the best keepers in Europe this season, sitting on the bench at Chelsea next season does not appeal to Courtois.

However, Courtois must follow Chelsea's instructions given he still has two years to run on his deal, though the Blues are keen not to upset the goalkeeper given he is yet to sign a new Blues contract.

Friend or foe: Courtois makes a save during Atletico's 3-1 win over Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final
