A pedestrian was shocked when police ordered him to take a Random Breath Test even though he was not driving a car - and argues he was not drunk and had not driven a car that day.

A video of the incident in Sydney, where the man challenges the police officers, has gone viral, with more than half a million hits in just four days. 

Raffael Galardi was walking through a Lane Cove car park in the north of the city when he was stopped by police, who told him that they chose to RBT him randomly.

In video footage, filmed on Galardi’s phone, the police confirm that he is not doing anything wrong but has been randomly selected to do a random breath test as he walks to Coles in broad daylight.

Galardi recorded the incident as he challenged police; arguing that he not even travelled in the parked car and that police had even watched his female companion exit from the driver’s seat.

Two police officers stopped a man and a woman who were walking in a Lane Cove supermarket and 'randomly chose' the man to give a breath test. The man claims he had walked into the car park and was not drunk

‘Do you just stop people walking and ask them for a breath test?’ an infuriated Galardi can be heard demanding of the police officers.

‘A breath test? Why? But I wasn’t even driving?’

‘I’m not drunk and I wasn’t driving.’

Galardi says he hadn't even been in the car, but had walked down to meet his companion in the car park.

When he arrived, the police turned on their lights and stopped the pair.

In the video, Galardi quizzes why his blood alcohol levels are being tested when he had not been behind the wheel of a vehicle, which police had allegedly seen his female companion park.

The female driver of the car was incensed, asking police, 'Don't I have to be driving a car? You're meant to pull someone up!'

‘You just saw her get out of the car. I thought you might just have been perving at her,’ he told police.

Police responded: ‘We saw the car was driving and we just wanted to stop and breath test it’, which prompted the bewildered young man’s witty response.

‘They saw the car driving? Oh. Well, they just want to breath test the car.’

The young man, walking to Coles during daylight with his female friend, felt targeted by the interrogation.

Police responded, ‘we saw the car was driving and we just wanted to stop and breath test it’, which prompted the bewildered young man’s witty response.‘They saw the car driving? Oh. Well, they just want to breath test the car’

‘You’ve pulled us up while we’re walking through a shopping centre.

‘You can’t just breath test pedestrians… Why are you picking on us?

'What because I’m dressed like this? Random? Well, why don’t you stop this bloke here?’

Galardi angrily continues to argue with police, who offer little response. 

‘Talk to me like a normal man… You have just picked on us walking through a shopping centre. Tell me why,’ Galardi demands.

One of the police officers explains that ‘we do about five breath tests a week.’

‘Don’t you have to be in your car driving? You’re meant to pull someone up,’ his female companion, allegedly the driver of the car, asks police.

Galardi maintains that he respects police officers and does not think the issue was serious. 

He found it humorous and is blown away by the huge response.

He was never made to give a breath test, walking away from police with a parting shot. 

‘When I break the law you can detain me.

'Otherwise, see you later. Go away!'
