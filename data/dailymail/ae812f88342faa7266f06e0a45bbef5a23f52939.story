A giant Louis Vuitton suitcase which erected in the middle of Red Square has sparked outrage among Russians who see the publicity stunt as an insult to the country's communist past

President Vladimir Putin's government has strugged to contain an uproar over the nine-metre high case, which is actually a pavilion set up to house an exhibition on possessions of the rich and famous.

Critics slammed the judgement of officials who sanctioned the event, which is being held just feet away from the Kremlin and the mausoleum of Bolshevik revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin.

Ill-fitting: The patterned suitcase, the likes of which are often seen as a symbol of excess and wealth, was branded an eyesore by critics

Valery Rashkin, a Communist member of the State Duma, said he was 'ashamed' of his country for allowing the pavilion to be built in such a politically significant location

Valery Rashkin, a Communist member of the State Duma, the lower parliament house called it an 'eyesore', saying 'I am ashamed of our country for putting a suitcase on its main square, this sacred area that should be protected by the state'.

After growing disquiet, a sign was placed on the pavilion on Wednesday evening announcing it was being dismantled, though the structure remained intact.

Despite straps on the structure in the colours of the Russian flag, the image of a Western luxury good only the richest can afford has jarred with patriotic citizens.

Putin loyalists in his United Russia party also railed against the case, with many claiming it should be moved to a more remote pare of Moscow.

Citing an unnamed Kremlin source, Russian news agencies said that Putin's administration had eventually ordered it to be removed.

'There's nothing terrible about the trunk itself and the good intentions - on the contrary' Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'But it is obvious that there's a problem with the sense of scale.'

Communist supporters still visit Red Square to see the mausoleum of the Bolshevik revolutionary Lenin

While a skating rink has been set up on Red Square for the winter holidays in recent years, the Kremlin is sensitive about use of the history-steeped expanse at Moscow's heart.

Protest band Pussy Riot performed on the square a month before their 'punk prayer' in a cathedral that resulted in jail terms, and a man who stripped naked and nailed himself to the cobbles this month may face criminal charges.

Louis Vuitton, whose parent company is LVMH, had said the exhibit, which was to open on December 2, was a tribute to its longstanding ties with Russia and that all revenue from it would go to the Naked Heart Foundation, a children's charity.

The charity's founder, model Natalia Vodianova, is the fiancee of a son of Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH.
