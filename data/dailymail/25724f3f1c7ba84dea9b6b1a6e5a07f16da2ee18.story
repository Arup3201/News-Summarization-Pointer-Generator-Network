The prime suspect in the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross was discovered hanged in dense woodland and was identified by his dental records, an inquest has heard.

Convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns was found dead in Boston Manor Park, west London, on October 4 - just four days after the teenager's body was pulled from a river less than a mile away.

A short hearing was held at West London Coroner's Court as the inquiry into the 41-year-old Latvian's death was opened and adjourned today.

Specialist teams recovered Zalkalns's body earlier this month after an extensive search of woodland

Coroner's officer Lana Atkinson told the court: 'A post mortem conducted on October 6 found a conditional cause of death is consistent with hanging.

'There is no evidence of third party involvement. Police are still investigating and he was identified by dental records.'

Alice Gross was last seen on CCTV walking along the Grand Union Canal in Hanwell on August 28.

Her body was found by London Fire Brigade divers just over a month later wrapped in a plastic bag and weighted down in the River Brent.

Zalkalns was seen on video footage cycling along the same towpath minutes after Alice. He went missing from his home in Hanwell days later.

Senior coroner Chinyere Inyama opened and adjourned the inquest until December during the brief hearing this morning.

He said: 'On the facts of this case I'm satisfied I will be able to open an inquest. This inquest is now opened and adjourned to December 19. I await a full post mortem report.' 

Zalkalns served seven years in prison in his native country of Latvia for bludgeoning and stabbing his wife Rudite to death.

Alice's disappearance  sparked one of the largest searches in the history of the Metropolitan Police

The general labourer, who worked at a building site in Isleworth, west London, is believed to have come to the UK in 2007, but authorities here are thought to have had no record of his murder conviction. 

Alice's body was found wrapped and weighted down in a shallow stretch of river by London Fire Brigade divers on September 30.

The schoolgirl from Hanwell was identified using dental records and a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive, a brief hearing in to her death heard earlier this month. 

Scotland Yard Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey has previously insisted that the investigation into Alice's murder is still live despite Zalkalns having been found dead.

He also defended the amount of time that it took to find Alice and Zalkalns' bodies.

Officers from 17 other police forces were drafted in to help with the search, including underwater experts from five forces and victim detection dogs and handlers from four outside the Met.

The search was the largest operation that Scotland Yard has carried out since the aftermath of the July 7 bombings an  involved around 600 officers, including teams from 17 other forces.
