An English tourist has died after plunging more than 30ft down a well at a Portuguese beauty spot.

The woman, believed to be in her sixties, was taking pictures of Arade Dam in the Algarve yesterday when she decided to get into a better position.

She sneaked around a gate and entered a fenced-off area, before climbing on to a large piece of metal covering a well.

But seconds later, the 6.5ft-wide lid gave way - and she fell 32ft to her death.

Emergency crews were called to the beauty spot in Silves, where firefighters used specialist equipment including a cable to descend into the well.

They found the woman lying on its concrete bottom and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

'Two [firefighters] descended by a cable to 
try to revive the victim, but without success,' said the captain Luís 
Simões, of the local fire department.

The tourist, who is yet to be named, had been on holiday in Albufeira, around 20 miles away, with her husband and two friends when the accident happened.

They had decided to travel to the picturesque town of Silves to tour the Dam, which is renowned for its natural beauty.

Yesterday, the beauty spot was packed with firefighters, paramedics and police as they removed the victim's body from the scene.
