A 17-year-old boy has been arrested for allegedly murdering his 11-year-old neighbor after she was found in a ditch three miles from her home - with her devoted dog guarding her body.

Christopher Sowell was arrested for first-degree murder in Gosnell, Arkansas on Wednesday, just hours after the body of missing Jessica Williams was found by Big Lake in Mississippi County.

Authorities have not said how the young 
girl died, but her devastated father Eric Williams said it looked as though she had drowned 
in two feet of water.

Tragic: Jessica Williams vanished on Tuesday night and her body was found in a ditch three miles away on Wednesday morning - with her loyal pet dog, Rhyback (right), standing over her

Arrest: Christopher Sowell, 17, was arrested late Wednesday night and will be charged as an adult

Jessica had been missing since Tuesday night when she vanished while playing with her dog in her father's front yard as he showered and prepared dinner.

A neighbor passed by and told him they had seen the young girl's bike at the end of the road - but that she was nowhere in sight.

'I said something don't feel right, so I 
drove on down to [a neighbor's] house. I said, "Have you seen her?" He ain't 
seen her,' Williams told WREG. 'We started going door to door all the way 
down here.'

Neighbors layunched a massive search for the girl, riding four wheelers in the farm fields to look for her - with no success.

Scene: Her bike was found near her home and her body was found in a ditch by this lake the next day

Home: She was last seen playing outside her father's home, pictured, with her dog on Tuesday night

Her father eventually reported her missing at 9pm, after she had been missing for around three hours, and said that he had last seen her outside his home just southwest of Gosnell.

Mississippi County Criminal Investigations Commander Robb Rounsavall said the girl's bicycle was found in a ditch near a house further down the road.

Her body was miles away from the site - and her father and investigators agreed it was not found anywhere where she could have easily walked or taken her bike.

It was found at 6.30am on Wednesday, with her loyal puppy, Rhyback, standing over her body, her father said.

Loss: Jessica, who was allegedly killed by a 17-year-old neighbor, loved the outdoors and animals

Shock: Her father, Eric Williams, said his beloved daughter had dreams of becoming a rancher

Her body is being sent to the Arkansas State Crime Lab to determine her cause of death.

Jessica's uncle Tim Southern expressed his shock at the senseless death.

'You
know, why would you want to take an 11-year-old and do this? I mean 
she's done nothing to you. She's just beginning life,' he said. 'She 
loved life itself. You know she loved her grandma, grandpas, her mom and
dad, especially her sister, little cousins.'

Mr Williams described the 11-year-old 
girl as a tomboy who loved her pets, was friendly with neighbors and 
loved bouncing on their trampoline.

'She wanted to be a rancher,' he said. 'She loved horses. She loved animals.'

Sowell will be arraigned this afternoon and is being charged as an adult in the case.
