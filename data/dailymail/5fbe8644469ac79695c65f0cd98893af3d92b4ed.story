French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has revealed she dons disguises so she can travel around Paris without being recognised.

The wife of Nicolas Sarkozy admitted to occasionally wearing a wig so can use the Metro in the French capital without being spotted.

Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy, speaking to a French political publication,Â  also compared herself to Lady Gaga while discussing her image within the media.

Born this way: French First Lady Carla Bruni said that in terms of her media image, she is like Lady Gaga

In one of her more bizarre interviews as she tried to boost Mr Sarkozy's re-election hopes, Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy, 44, said that she is often in disguise 'literally as well as figuratively'.

Asked if she considered being the First Lady a difficult job, she said: 'Not really. I've been, since the age of 20, well separated from my public image.

'It's greatly helped me that I've been a model and then a singer. If I hadn't had the experience of media exposure, that would have been harder.

'Notoriety does not weight heavily on me, and then I disguise myself literally as well as figuratively.

'With a wig, nobody recognises me on the Metro. Recently, my bag was still searched on a visit to the Marine Museum.'

Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy went on to discuss her apparent transformation into a loyal political wife along the lines of the late French First Lady, Claude Pompidou.

But she added that with her media profile, she has a very different public image.

She added: 'I loved Mrs. Pompidou and I do not see that it is ridiculous to devote yourself to good works.

'Other than that, next to Mrs.Pompidou, with my experience with the media, I am Lady Gaga!'

Asked directly if she deliberately played the 'ravishing idiot', Carla relied : 'I don't play anything, but I know my limits, and that's not exactly the sign of an idiot.

'Certain subjects like economics are beyond me, I won't pretend otherwise.'
