Spain's Eurovision hopeful Edurne reveals she and Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea are 'very, very happy' together but would 'erase him' from her life if he was unfaithful.

The stunner, voted sexiest woman of the year in Spain in 2010 by the readers of FHM, said she may not even have time to marry her boyfriend of four years if she wins the song contest.

Edurne was speaking after it was today announced she had been chosen to represent Spain in May's Eurovision.

Happy couple: Edurne Garcia has been dating Manchester United goalie David de Gea for the past four years.

New year: Stunning Edurne tweeted this picture with the caption: 'Batteries recharged 100 per cent, prepared for everything awaiting me this year' 

The singer rose to fame after appearing in Spain's equivalent of Pop Idol in 2005 and she succeeds former X Factor star Ruth Lorenzo, who finished tenth in last year's Eurovision. 

After being told the news, Madrid-born Edurne, 29, said she is keeping her fingers crossed Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will give his star goalie time off so he can travel with her to Vienna for the competition.

Her boyfriend, 24, was one of the first people she phoned after being told she had been selected to represent Spain at this year's competition.

She said: 'He was very happy for me when I told him, just like my family and friends.

'The people who love you share in your good news.

'David and I are very very happy together. I think he's going to be tied up with league commitments but I hope he can be there at the final along with my family and friends so we can live the experience together.'

The Spanish singer had previously said she would love de Gea to ask her to marry him, but now it seems she may not have the time.  

'If I win, I don't know if I'll have time to marry or not,' she added. 

'I think I'll have to take advantage of the moment and do a lot of other things. But everything happens at the right time. 

'At the moment it's the Eurovision song contest and I want to concentrate 100 per cent on that and afterwards we'll see about the other things.' 

Famous: Edurne rose to fame after appearing in Spain's equivalent of Pop Idol in 2005. She sang with Olly Murs at the the 40 Principales Awards in 2013

Edurne got used to being in front of a camera as a child. She did her first casting call and TV advert for a fruit juice when she was just six.

She got into singing because of her family's love of karaoke, becoming part of a child band called Trastos when she was 12, which published three records.

She admitted today: 'I knew when I went on stage for the first time and heard the first applause that this was my world.

'I can't find words to describe the sensation I felt, being so young.

'I knew then I wanted to devote myself to music for the rest of my life.'

She went on to combine studying to become a vet with working as a supermarket cashier at weekends to make ends meet.

And although she ended up abandoning her studies to concentrate on music she remains a great animal lover.  

Long distance: Despite living in different countries, Edurne said: 'We're very good together and complement each other very well'

She looks after two dogs and three cats at her home near Madrid and her Chow Chow lives with her boyfriend in Manchester.

Edurne, who performs under her first name only, is a household name in Spain although she is relatively unknown in Britain.

She has enjoyed chart success with several songs from her five albums, including the lead single from her first album reaching number five in the Spanish charts.

From 2007 to 2013 she played Sandy in a Spanish production of the musical Grease.

She has also appeared in the Spanish version of Strictly Come Dancing and has spent the past seven months co-presenting a comedy show on Spanish TV.

De Gea and Edurne met during the recording of a charity CD in November 2010, just a few months before David moved to Manchester.

He was far less known in his native country than his famous girlfriend. 

Eurovision: 'Perhaps this is the most important thing that has happened in my career ever. I know it's a huge challenge and a huge responsibility and I will give it my best shot,' Edurne (pictured) said 

She has been dating Old Trafford shot-stopper de Gea, who is five years younger than her, for the past four years.

They have spent much of their time thousands of miles apart following his decision to sign for Manchester United in June 2011 for 17.8 million pounds, a British record for a goalkeeper.

Edurne stayed in Spain when her boyfriend moved to the UK so she could focus on her career.

Although their careers mean they spend most of their time apart at the moment, she says she confides in David 100 per cent.

But she warned: 'I'm not jealous and you have to have trust in your partner but I wouldn't understand it if the person I'm with was unfaithful. I would erase him from my life.'

Speaking last April, the Spanish singer admitted: 'These years with David have brought me so many things and continue to do so.

'We're very good together and complement each other very well.

'I'm very happy by his side. I couldn't ask for more in that respect.

'It's obviously difficult with him being so far away so much of the time and I'd love not to have to have a long distance relationship.

'But while David's happy, I'm going to support him whatever he decides. 

'For him, his career is the most important thing at the moment and for me as well.

'We support each other and respect each other as we should. And although I'd love him to be a bit nearer, Manchester is only two hours away by plane and whenever we've got a bit of free time we try to see each other.'

Edurne will perform a song entirely in Spanish called Amanecer - 'Dawn' in English.

She presented the song to Spain's state broadcaster as part of her Eurovision bid ahead of today's announcement.

Hinting she was hoping to bring fans important news two days ago, she posted a picture on Twitter of her with her washboard stomach under a palm tree in a bikini.

The message alongside it said: 'Batteries recharged 100 per cent, prepared for everything awaiting me this year.'

This year's Eurovision Song Contest, the 60th, will be held in the Vienna Stadthalle.

The two semi-finals will be held on May 19 and May 21, and the grand final on May 23. 

'I'm very happy and am looking forward to May to give it my all,' Edurne added.

'Perhaps this is the most important thing that has happened in my career ever. I know it's a huge challenge and a huge responsibility and I will give it my best shot.'
