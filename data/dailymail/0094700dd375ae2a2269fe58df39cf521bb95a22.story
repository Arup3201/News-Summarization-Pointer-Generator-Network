Ed Miliband has spoken for the first time how he used to go out with BBC economic correspondent Stephanie Flanders - some months before she had a relationship with Ed Balls.

The Labour leader, who admitted he was a ‘late developer’ when it comes to women, denied it was weird that he had dated the same journalist as his shadow Chancellor.

The relationship is believed to have happened in the 1990s, after they had left university. But, until now, Mr Miliband has been unwilling to speak about the affair, which happened many years before he met his wife Justine.

The Labour leader spoke about his love life in an interview with Now magazine - but he admitted that it did not get going until he left home and started university.

Asked whether he had had many girlfriends when he was young, Mr Miliband replied: ‘Not really. I was a late developer.’

The magazine then asked him whether it meant he was not like Nick Clegg, who claimed that he had slept with ‘no more than 30 women’ before he met his wife.

‘I’m not going to compare myself to Nick Clegg in any way,’ he said. ‘I was quite square and serious. Girls came a bit later - university and after.’

Mr Miliband was then asked whether it 
was ‘weird’ that he had shared a girlfriend - Stephanie Flanders - with 
Ed Balls, he said: ‘We did both date her but there was a long time apart
between me and Ed.

‘Stephanie and I don’t have any problems running into each other now.’

Oxford-educated
Stephanie Flanders, the daughter of comic songwriter Michael Flanders, 
was appointed BBC economic editor in 2008.

Ed Balls and Miss Flanders are believed to have had a relationship in the mid-1990s

Miss Flanders is believed to have had her relationship with Mr Balls in the mid-1990s, when the pair worked as journalists on the Financial Times. The relationship with Mr Miliband happened before this.

In the interview with Now magazine, the Labour leader denied he was upset that people say his brother David is ‘hotter’ than him.

‘I think my wife thinks I’m hotter,’ he said. ‘If she didn’t I’d be worried!’

Mr Miliband married his wife Justine Thornton, a former child actress, in 2001. They have two sons - Daniel and Samuel.

He told the magazine that they met at a friend’s dinner when he was with someone else. They stayed in touch and then started going out when he was campaigning to be a Doncaster MP.

He recalled: ‘She was helping put out chairs for a campaign meeting and these ladies were there saying: “You didn’t come all this way just to put out chairs, love!”

‘Quite quickly I got to the point where I thought: “I can’t imagine my life without Justine”.

‘I really feel so lucky. She’s so much the rock of my life. It sounds a bit corny, but I wouldn’t be doing this job and I wouldn’t be happy without her.’

The Labour leader said he preferred brunettes to blondes - ‘I’d be in trouble if I didn’t say that’ - and revealed he prefers M&S underwear to designer brands.

Mr Miliband also used the interview to confirm he his fighting ‘the battle of the bulge’, and that his wife often stops him going outside wearing horrible clothes such as ‘big jumpers, nasty corduroys’.
