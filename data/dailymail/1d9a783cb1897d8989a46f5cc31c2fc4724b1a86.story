Inside the world of a killer: Pistorius shot dead his girlfriend a year ago... Sportsmail's Jonathan McEvoy goes on the trail of the Blade Runner

South African prosecutors who charged Olympian Oscar Pistorius with murder have admitted he may not have had his prosthetic legs on when he fired the shots that killed his girlfriend, removing the key argument the shooting was premeditated.

Pistorius, who goes on trial on March 3, denies the charge of murder and claims he mistook his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired a number of bullets through his bathroom door, killing her instantly.

Steenkamp, a South African model, was 29.

Killed: Oscar Pistorius will stand trial on March 3 for murdering his girlfriend n Valentine's Day

But documents obtained by South African television news channel eNCA revealed the state’s own ballistics expert said the 27-year-old was ‘most likely’ on his stumps when he pulled the trigger repeatedly.

During an extensive bail hearing, prosecutors argued Pistorius took time to put on his prostheses before firing the shots through the locked bathroom door, indicating he was not panicked by the prospect of an intruder.

Prosecutors believe security guards at Pistorius’ gated community called the athlete after the shooting to check if everything was okay, to which he replied he was fine and did not require assistance, eNCA reported.

Police also claim a neighbour who lives less than 100 metres away heard shouting on Valentine’s Day, the night of Steenkamp’s death.

The National Prosecuting Authority said it had not leaked the documents.

‘The defence has access to everything, to the docket and all evidential material we have,’ spokesman Nathi Mncube said.

‘We don't give anything to any other person other than the defence and if it gets leak(ed), it won't be us. We can't do that because it's damaging to our case.’

Known around the world as ‘the Blade Runner’ for competing on two fibre-optic blades and running against able-bodied athletes in the London 2012 Olympic Games, Pistorius has turned his official website into a noticeboard to post updates and messages of support relating to the case.

Last week, on the anniversary of Steenkamp’s death, Pistorius posted on his website: ‘No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved - and continues to love Reeva.

‘The pain and sadness – especially for Reeva’s parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow.

‘The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.’

Pistorius, who had his legs amputated below the knee when he was a young boy, became the first amputee to win an able-bodied world track medal at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics.
