Indian typist Vijay Singh can rattle out more than 100 words a minute thanks to his 12 fingers.

But Mr Singh, who also has 12 toes because of his polydactyly, says he cannot get work in his native country because employers only want attractive women.

Now he is planning a move to Britain in a bid to find employment after being rejected from more than 50 jobs.

Gimme six: Indian Vijay Singh is a super-fast typist thanks to his 12 fingers

The 48-year-old, from Agra in northern India, said: ‘They want pretty women, not some guy who has 12 fingers.’

Polydactyly sufferers are seen as lucky in India and Mr Singh has a rare form where his extra finger is a fully-functioning digit.

Most people with the condition have a small piece of soft tissue that can be removed and occasionally it contains bone, but no joints.

Despite his typing speed, Mr Singh says he cannot get a clerk job because Indian employers only want attractive women

But despite being a self-proclaimed ‘whizz on the computer’ thanks to his gift, he has yet to get a job and now wants to travel to the UK in the hope there will be something for him, reports Metro.

The world's fastest typist is Michael Shestov. He can type in 27 languages, reaching the mind-boggling speed of 17 characters per second!

Shestov learned to type as a clerk in the Russian army, where he would type for up to 8 hours a day.
