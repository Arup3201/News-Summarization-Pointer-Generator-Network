Wigan hope to have the deal completed by the weekend.

Sinclair made his Liverpool debut in a League Cup win over West Brom in 2012 but hasn't made a senior appearance since, though he was recently named in the squad to face Besiktas in the Europa League.

The teenager has five England Under 17 caps.
