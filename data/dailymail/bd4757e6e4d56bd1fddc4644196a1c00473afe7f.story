Halloween turned into a nightmare for some parts of the country as severe thunderstorms are blamed for the deaths of three people in Texas and Tennessee.

Storms blanketed much of the U.S. Thursday night - from southeastern Texas, through the Midwest and as far north as Maine.

In central Texas, near Austin, two people drowned as heavy rains in the drought-plagued region caused flash floods that swept away unsuspecting victims. Hundreds more people had to flee their homes.

In Tennessee, a 9-year-old boy was struck and killed by a downed power line cause by heavy winds.

Officials in parts of at least four states in the path of the storm - Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee - said they decided to put off the customary practice of children in costumes going from house to house collecting candy.

The Tennessean newspaper reports that strong winds knocked down tree limbs - which cut power to some 15,000 homes in the area.

A 9-year-old boy accidentally touched one of the downed power lines and was electrocuted, according to the newspaper.

Trick-or-treating was not canceled in that city, thought it is unknown whether that was why the boy was out.

In Austin, Texas, police report that the body of a man 50 to 60 years old was found Thursday in the city's flooded Onion Creek.

The Caldwell County sheriff's office reported earlier that a man died Thursday after driving on a low-lying portion of road overtaken by flooding. The man was swept out of his vehicle in Dale, south of Austin.

Authorities said the decision to cancel trick-or-treating in some areas was prudent, considering the storms rolling through much of the Eastern U.S.

'I think it's a good idea,' said Tara Dudzik, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Indianapolis. 'Winds of up to 60 miles per hour, and lightning - those are the main threats we'd be concerned about.'

Low pressure with a trailing cold front is pushing turbulent weather from the Gulf states north through the Mississippi Valley and toward the Great Lakes, said Myron Badgett, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio.

The cities of Indianapolis and Muncie, Indiana, postponed trick-or-treating, local officials said. Toledo and at least 30 cities in Central Ohio put it off until Friday or as late as Sunday, according to the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission's website.

At Fort Campbell in Kentucky, the children of soldiers will not be deployed to the streets of the residential area. 'Operation Friendly Ghost' has been put off until Friday.

Crievewood Baptist Church in Nashville, Tennessee, said it canceled a 'Halloween Break Station' that was planning to offer parents and children hot dogs, chips, water and games along trick-or-treating routes. The decision was made because so few children were expected to be out, it said.

Indianapolis has long required registered sex offenders, who are barred from having contact with children, to attend a meeting during trick-or-treat hours on Halloween night. That meeting has been rescheduled for Friday.

But Halloween was still on in Cincinnati, which according to a local television station, has not delayed or canceled trick-or-treating in two decades because of snow or thunderstorms. The National Weather Service was forecasting rain and gusty winds, and residents were urged to take care.

SOME GO AHEAD

In Nashville, trick-or-treating has also not been put off, but Mayor Karl Dean was urging caution.

'We
want everyone to pay close attention to the weather, especially if any 
thunderstorm or tornado warnings are issued," Dean said. "We know 
families want to have fun this evening, but most importantly, everyone 
needs to be safe and make good decisions for themselves and their family
members."

Several school 
systems west of Nashville dismissed classes early to get the children 
home before the bad weather hits, and some after-school activities were 
canceled, officials said.

In Mississippi, emergency management officials put out a warning asking parents to be mindful.

Trevor
Boucher, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in 
Nashville, Tennessee, said his office was getting a lot of calls from 
city and county officials who were trying to decide whether to proceed 
with Halloween activities.

The
storm was expected to move northeast from Texas well before evening, 
but it left behind flooding that caused some evacuation of low-lying 
areas.

Overnight rains of 
up to 15 inches in some areas swelled rivers and washed out low-lying 
crossings in a swath of more than 100 miles around Austin, Texas, 
according to Jon Zeitler, meteorologist with the National Weather 
Service Austin-San Antonio office.

'For certain areas, it looks like this will be in their Top 10 (flood events) of all time,' Zeitler said.

A
man died on Thursday in a flooded area southeast of Austin after being 
caught in high water in his car, officials said. Local media later in 
the day reported a second body in a creek closer to the city but further
information was unavailable.

More than 1,000 homes in neighborhoods near rising creeks were evacuated during the height of the floods.

The
storm was caused in part by Hurricane Raymond, which dissipated in the 
Pacific Ocean on Tuesday. Its remnants pulled heavy weather across the 
western United States.

That
combined with warm, humid, low-lying air from the Gulf of Mexico and 
cooler air at higher altitudes to produce the floods - conditions 
expected to return next week with more potential for flooding from a 
tropical storm brewing in the same region, Zeitler said.
