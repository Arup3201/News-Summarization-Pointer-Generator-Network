The true scale of Britain's soft justice system has been laid bare after it emerged 29,000 criminals have avoided prison sentences despite racking up 25 or more previous conditions.

Research from the Centre for Crime Prevention revealed how habitual criminals are routinely avoiding jail terms with some even having received 300 or more previous convictions or cautions.

Data from Freedom of Information requests shows that almost 112,000 criminals, found guilty of at least their sixth offence in 2012 avoided prison.

Only has himself to blame: Authorities had no clue Zinnel concealed his millions at the time of his bankruptcy proceedings, but his desire to get back at his wife got the best of him after he tried reporting her to the FBI. That's when feds first smelled a rat in his money laundering case

More than 55,000 avoided prison despite 15 or more previous offences, 29,000 avoided prison despite 25 or more previous offences and 5,692 offenders avoided prison despite 50 or more previous offences.

Peter Cuthbertson, author of the report and Director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: 'The courts are utterly failing to show they take crime seriously.

'Prison is the only sure way to protect 
the public from hardened criminals. The most prolific offenders are 
responsible for a growing percentage of all crime, and locking them up 
would have a massive impact on the crime rate.

How Britain's repeat offenders are dodging prison

'New Zealand recently fought rising crime by letting criminals know that it is "three strikes and you’re out". In Britain, we don’t even have 300 strikes and you’re out.'

Northumbria was found to have the softest courts in Britain with 96 per cent of all criminals avoiding prison.

Warwickshire came next with 95.5 per cent, followed by Lincolnshire (94.7 per cent) and Dyfed-Powys (94.4 per cent).

And contrary
 to claims that women are treated more harshly by the courts, male 
criminals with either one or two previous convictions or cautions were 
found to be more than twice as likely to go to prison.

Latest figures for the last week of 2013 show all but 1,561 of the 85,953 prison places were filled, with many jails are breaking point.

Last
 week we revealed how many criminals avoiding jail had been found
 guilty of serious offences including rape, kidnap and arson.

Of
 almost 200,000 convictions for serious offences, just 52,000 were 
jailed and of those only 6,715 were sentenced to more than four years 
behind bars.

Half of arsonists, burglars, sex 
attackers and people convicted of conspiracy to murder, child abduction 
and sex with under-13s avoided jail.

Among
 those walking free from court in 2012 were 736 arsonists, 69 rapists, 
1,177 people convicted of sex assaults, 2,745 fraudsters, 162 who killed
 by reckless driving and 77 kidnappers.

Only 14 per cent of the 4,659 people convicted of common assault were jailed and fewer than a quarter of 
the 615 convicted of cruelty or neglect of children and 27 per cent of 
people who caused death by dangerous driving were given prison 
sentences.

In 2012, 1,354 
people were convicted of arson, of which 618 were given immediate 
custodial sentences, including 135 jailed for more than four years.

Even among those who are jailed, many are given soft sentences of less than six months, including 2,629 burglars, 1,057 fraudsters, 6,838 convicted of assault and 76 robbers.

The figures were released by the Ministry of Justice in response to a parliamentary question.

Justice Secretary Mr Grayling said: 'Since 2010 those who break the law are more likely to go to prison for longer and we are continuing to overhaul sentencing to ensure that the toughest sentencing measures are available to the courts.'
