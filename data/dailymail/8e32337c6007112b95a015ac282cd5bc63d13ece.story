David Cameron put the UK on a collision course with Europe today as he promised to fight a ruling forcing Britain to give prisoners the vote.

The Prime Minister insisted the decision was one for MPs, not a 'foreign court', after human rights judges issued an ultimatum giving the Government six months to change the law.

European judges rode roughshod over British sovereignty yesterday by ruling that prisoners must be allowed to vote.

In a devastating blow, they rejected last year's overwhelming vote by MPs for maintaining our historic blanket ban on voting by convicts.

The unelected judges instead gave David Cameron until the end of the year to obey their diktat or risk having to pay £150million in compensation to killers, rapists and other prisoners.

The EU ruling will mean thousands of prisoners held in UK jails will get voting rights

But Mr Cameron told MPs this afternoon he backed their overwhelming democratic vote last year that opposed the European Court of Human Rights' ruling.

At Prime Minister’s Questions, he said: 'I have always believed when you are sent to prison you lose certain rights and one of those rights is the right to vote.

'Crucially, I believe this should be a matter for Parliament to decide, not a foreign court.

'Parliament has made its decision and I completely agree with it.'

Tory MPs said today it created an unprecedented clash between the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the Westminster Parliament.

They demanded that Mr Cameron – who once said the thought of prisoners voting made him feel 'physically ill' – should now 'take a stand for Britain's interests'.

The battle risks sparking further demands for Britain to withdraw from the court, which has caused outrage with a string of controversial rulings on deporting foreign criminals and terror suspects.

A leading constitutional expert said the issue at stake was whether the UK remained in control of its own destiny or took orders from a remote foreign court.

Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, an ex-member of the Coalition's own human rights commission, said: 'The principal issue is not whether prisoners are allowed to vote but whether the rules are set by a directly elected parliament or a group of European judges.'

The ECHR – whose judges do not even need to have any judicial experience in their homeland – first ruled in favour of John Hirst, a convicted axe killer demanding the right to vote, in 2004.

The Coalition may be forced to give the vote to prisoners, despite David Cameron saying the prospect of doing so made him 'physically ill'

A string of appeals and legal cases followed before MPs voted by an overwhelming majority of 234 to 22 last February to defy the court and maintain the ban, which has existed for more than 100 years.

Ministers hoped the strength of feeling would force Strasbourg to think again, and lodged a fresh appeal to the Euro court's Grand Chamber.

Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, told the court that its judges should not be able to tell countries what to do on social questions.

But yesterday the Grand Chamber upheld the original Hirst verdict. Officials are unaware of any further grounds for appeal.

Ruling: The decision will be seen as a victory for the likes of John Hirst, the convicted axe killer who was released from jail in 2004 and has been campaigning for prisoners to get the vote

They now have six months to introduce legislation to give at least some prisoners the vote.

The only consolation was that the Euro judges said it was up to the Government to decide how best to obey its orders.

One option previously considered by officials, to give the vote to convicts serving less than four years, would allow almost 30,000 to take part in elections.

Yesterday's judgment suggested that a time limit of three years may be acceptable. This would still mean granting the vote to tens of thousands of inmates, in clear defiance  of the express wishes of Parliament.

Backbench Tory MPs, who led the Parliamentary revolt last year, attacked the ECHR's latest ruling and made it plain they will not give up the fight.

Ex-shadow home secretary David Davis said: 'This regrettable decision is an infringement of the UK Parliament's right to decide on matters which are fundamental to the British way of life, and which are not appropriate to judicial intervention.'

Dominic Raab, an MP and legal expert, said: 'Strasbourg is setting the scene for a major constitutional clash over who writes the laws of the land.'

Tory MP Priti Patel said: 'The public will be demanding that the Prime Minister now stands up for British interests and refuses to give convicted prisoners the right to vote.

'Europe's out-of-touch judges have also blocked the Home Secretary from deporting Abu Qatada and allowed dangerous foreign criminals to remain in the UK.

'It is about time real changes are made to prevent them meddling in our laws again.'

The ruling emerged a month after Justice Secretary Ken Clarke failed in his effort to secure major reform of Strasbourg and give Britain more control over its affairs

Dr Pinto-Duschinsky, now a legal expert at the Policy Exchange think tank, said: 'The judgment, while allowing some room for manoeuvre to the UK over the issue, still puts the Strasbourg court in direct conflict with the House of Commons which overwhelmingly voted earlier this year that prisoners should not be permitted to vote while they are incarcerated.'

Labour will back David Cameron if he chooses to fight Europe on prisoners’ voting rights, shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said today.

Mr Balls said there was cross-party agreement about not giving the vote to prisoners and the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) was the 'wrong thing.'

'I am all in favour of prisoners having the right kind of support and being rehabilitated but voting is one of the things I think you give up if you go to prison,' he told ITV Daybreak.

He added: 'If David Cameron is going to go out there and fight this one, we will be supporting him on that.'

Labour repeatedly stalled over the implementation of the 2004 ruling, knowing it would be deeply unpopular with voters.

Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice secretary, said: 'The original decision back in 2004 was wrong, and that's why the Labour government didn't implement it, and we appealed again and again.'

He added: 'On these kinds of issues, the European Court should give far more discretion to individual countries. This is an important reform that needs to be implemented.'

'Strasbourg is setting the scene for a major constitutional clash over who writes the laws of the land.'

Dominic Raab MP

In 2010, David Cameron told MPs: 'It makes me physically ill to contemplate giving the vote to prisoners.'

But he said the Government reluctantly accepted there was a legal obligation to offer voting rights at least to some prisoners, or face possible compensation claims running into millions of pounds. At least 2,500 inmates have already lodged claims.

Yesterday's European court judgment related to a test case involving Italian Franco Scoppola, a convicted murderer who was demanding the right to vote.

The UK was made a party to the case as it has Europe-wide implications. The killer lost on the grounds that, unlike Britain, Italy does not have a blanket ban.

Last night a Downing Street spokesman said: 'This is a judgment affecting Italy, but clearly we need to consider the implications on the issue of prisoner voting for the UK.

'The position for the UK is that the Attorney General has argued that the issue of social policy, including prisoner voting, is a matter for Parliament and it is for Parliament to judge whether and which prisoners should have the vote.'

In an earlier version of this article we described Mr John Hirst as an 'axe murderer'. He was convicted of manslaughter after killing a woman with an axe.
