An EU plan to log drugs sold at chemists on a national database could threaten confidentiality, experts have warned.

Under changes due to come into effect by 2018, every packet of medicine passed over the counter in Britain will have a unique serial number which will be recorded on a centralised computer system.

This number can be scanned at the point it is given to the patient, verifying it is legitimate.

The overhaul of administering over-the-counter and prescription drugs is part of a crackdown by Brussels on counterfeit products flooding the market.

But as part of the proposals, the drug's serial number will be linked to the patient's records in the pharmacy to allow the medicine to be traced if problems arise later or if it needs to be recalled.

Currently, pharmacies are not connected to outside databases so information is only stored locally.

The fear is that if hackers get into the central database they could access confidential information, such as patients' names, ages, addresses and medical histories.

Phil Booth, of the patient campaign group Med Confidential, said: 'Linking drugs that have been prescribed to patient details is incredibly dangerous and the risks on confidentiality are immense.

'The drugs that you take indicate the condition that you have, which is highly sensitive information.'

The changes are being introduced under the EU Falsified Medicines Directive, passed in 2013.
