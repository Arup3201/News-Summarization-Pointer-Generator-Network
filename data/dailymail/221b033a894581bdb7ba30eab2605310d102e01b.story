Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao continue to step up their preparations ahead of their $300million (£200m) mega-fight in May. 

Having come face-to-face earlier in the week in Los Angeles, the pair returned to their respective camps and got back to the serious business of training. 

Now 38, questions have been about whether Mayweather's powers are declining - whether that lighting speed of his is starting to slow.

Well, if his skipping is anything to go by, the Money Man seems as fast ever. Mayweather posted a video on Instagram of himself working out on Friday - with Phil Collins' In the Air Tonight playing in the background. 

Earlier in the day, he posted pictures of himself working on the speed bag, heavy bag and pads. 

Pacquiao, meanwhile, also posted a video on Instagram as he continued his road work with another group running session. It is the second day in a row that the 36-year-old has gone for a long run, having also had a similar outing on Thursday.

The pair's preparation continued as it was announced that they had agreed that their mega-fight would be conducted under the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) testing program.

The Las Vegas showdown will observe the rules established under the World Anti-Doping Code (Code), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List and the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing.

Both fighters have agreed to unannounced blood and urine testing without reservation and will be tested out of competition prior to the fight and in competition after the fight.
