One Foot in the Grave follows Victor Meldrew and his wife Margaret’s various misfortunes as they battle against the trials of modern life.

And in a case of life imitating art, the actress who played Margaret is embroiled in her own suburban struggle.

Annette Crosbie, 78, is locked in a dispute with developers after she learnt of plans to build ‘ugly and intrusive’ retirement homes on her doorstep.

'Offended': Annette Crosbie and neighbour Ian Smith at the site of the proposed residential home

Indeed, the actress may well be tempted to use Victor’s immortal catchphrase ‘I don’t believe it’ to vent her frustration.

Miss Crosbie, who lives in Raynes 
Park, south-west London, said she was ‘deeply offended’ by the design of
the homes and criticised developers for failing to ask residents for 
their views. The actress’s house backs on to land belonging to Nelson 
Hospital.

After 15 years of wrangling, plans for its redevelopment are now in an advanced stage.

Part of the site will be turned into a
care centre with two GP surgeries. Developers also want to turn a car 
park area into a retirement home for 51 residents, plans which Crosbie 
objects to.

The actress said: ‘What angers me is 
the high-handed way it’s been done. We haven’t been consulted. I’m 
deeply offended by the design. This is for people aged 80 and over. I 
look at this and I think this has just not been done with any compassion
or interest or empathy. It’s been done because the NHS needs money and 
needs the developers to do what they need to do to the hospital. It 
looks like a warehouse.

‘I don’t care what they decorate the 
facade with. Fifty-one people my age and over are going to be squashed 
in there just so that the development can go ahead.’

Ian Smith, another resident, described the plans as ‘ugly, intrusive and monolithic’.

He said: ‘We live in a lovely road 
and it’s going to be horribly affected by this huge monolithic building.
It’s a big thing and will potentially ruin our street.

‘Our street is part of the 
conservation area and there’s a directive that says any development in 
such an area should preserve and enhance the area and should not 
adversely affect it. Our contention is that it’s going to ruin it 
substantially.’

A spokesman for developers McCarthy 
and Stone said: ‘Our strength lies in our experience of building superb 
homes tailored to the needs and aspirations of our older residents, 
promoting independence and allowing older people to continue to lead 
healthy and active lives.

‘Our plans aim to meet the needs of residents keen to remain in Merton.

‘The proposal would offer an 
opportunity to introduce a sensitive form of development, which is 
designed to complement the surrounding area and blend with the design of
the new hospital.’

The development is part of the NHS’s plan to modernise care facilities and provide more services.

The plans are due to go before a planning committee on September 6.
