A pub chef escaped with his life by seconds when a five-tonne trailer full of Maize crushed his car moments before he was due to leave work.

Daniel Baynham was heading out the door when a trailer carrying crops from a nearby field spilled its giant load on to his Skoda Felicia hatchback.

The container was being towed through the village bear Oswestry in Shropshire when it overturned and flipped straight onto the black car - completely obliterating the small vehicle.

Mr Baynham, 21, had been working at his father's pub, the Queen's Head, when his car was destroyed on Saturday.

Obliterated: Daniel Baynham, 21, was metres from his Skoda Felicia when the green trailer tipped onto it

His father, David, 44, said: 'Daniel was working on Saturday and had just finished his shift at about half two when it happened.

'There was an almighty crash and we all ran outside to see the trailer lying on its side.

'Daniel's car was completely swamped with maize, you could barely see it from underneath the trailer.

'We have had endless problems with those trailers, the council even forced the company to put up signs telling the drivers they had to drive at 20mph.

'But they still race through here, and they keep tipping over.

'It is a miracle no-one has been killed by them, if it had been a few seconds later Daniel would have been out of the door and right in the firing line.

'I dread to think what could have happened.'

The trailer had been carrying several tonnes of maize from fields in Shropshire to processing plants on Friday afternoon.

Emergency services arrived at 2.45pm and closed the road for several hours as they cleared up the bright blue New Holland tractor.

Fellow motorist James Fellows, 45, said he saw the trailer fly around the tight bend by the pub.

He said: 'It was always going way too fast. You just can't believe how quick they drive round here

'These big heavy trailers just can't be controlled at those speeds.

'Whoever the driver was, he didn't really think about the corner coming up, and the trailer wobbled, and then just flipped onto the car.

'It's so lucky there was no-one inside, or they wouldn't have stood a chance.
