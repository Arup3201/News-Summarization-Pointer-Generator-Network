L'equipe are reporting that Paris Saint-Germain have identified Manchester United's Angel di Maria and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba  as their two main transfer targets.

The French paper also reports that Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette, Ligue 1's top scorer with 23 goals so far this season, is also on the shortlist of the reigning French champions.

Di Maria has endured an inconsistent first season at Old Trafford since switching to Manchester United in a £59.7million move from Real Madrid in August.

The Argentina international started strongly under Louis van Gaal but has found starting opportunities limited  lately and was sent off in United's FA Cup defeat to Arsenal for pushing referee Michael Oliver in March.

As for Pogba, the France midfielder is one of the most coveted players in Europe.

He has been instrumental in helping Juventus establish a 14-point advantage at the summit of Serie A, while helping his side into the quarter-final of the Champions League, where they will meet Monaco.

The 22-year-old, who was on United's books, has been linked with a move to Madrid but PSG could try to edge ahead of their European rivals with a big money offer to take Pogba back to France.

Lacazette, meanwhile, has spearheaded Lyon's assault on the top of Ligue 1 and the club only trail PSG by a point in the table with 30 games played.

Alexandre Lacazette has scored 23 goals for Lyon and is the top scorer in Ligue 1

If Laurent Blanc managed to snare the league's top-scorer from his title rivals, it could be a coup that would be equal in importance as any potential arrival of Di Maria and Pogba.

Lacazette has undoubted scoring pedigree in France and would strengthen PSG's attack while simultaneously denting Lyon's.

PSG were shackled by Financial Fair Play restrictions last summer but Blanc clearly wants to bring at least one star name to the Parc des Princes this year.
