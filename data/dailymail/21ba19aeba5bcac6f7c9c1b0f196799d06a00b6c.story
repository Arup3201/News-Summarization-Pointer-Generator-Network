'We must play on' was Michael Clarke’s message to his team-mates when he spoke so movingly at Phillip Hughes’ funeral. And play on he will, having declared himself emotionally ready to lead Australia in the first Test since Hughes’ death.

Clarke’s hamstring had been the physical concern leading up to the rearranged match, but the biggest worry was his torn heart, and emotions which will take much longer to heal. Clarke also talked at the funeral of feeling Hughes’ spirit around him; that spirit will be very much among the players at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday as they poignantly named him as 13th man in their side.

A state memorial service meanwhile, which had been slated to take place at the Sydney Cricket Ground, has been cancelled in consultation with Cricket Australia and the Hughes family. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird explained the decision, saying, 'All parties felt that given the enormous outpouring of support at last Wednesday's funeral, a state memorial service would no longer need to be held.'

Clarke was excused the captain’s traditional pre-Test media conference, and so Mitchell Johnson was given the task of announcing the Test XI, with Clarke as skipper, and Josh Hazlewood and Shaun Marsh missing out.

'It’s a huge boost to have him (Clarke) back paying for us,' said Johnson. 'With his captaincy - and he’s shown how strong he’s been over the last couple of weeks with the tragedy that we’ve had – it’s really nice to have him back. He’s a tough captain. We just want him to score runs and be that aggressive captain.'

Johnson, chief aggressor for Australia with the ball, was inevitably asked about the use of his bouncer, which had Kevin Pietersen admitting to feeling 'petrified' when England were turned over during the Ashes 12 months ago.

'We’ve got to play the way we’ve been playing, and that’s being aggressive. I know our boys will be going out there playing the best cricket we can, and if that’s bowling the short ball like we have been, that’s what we’ll do. We’re not going to change a thing.'

The feeling was shared by Virat Kohli, who will captain India in a Test for the first time in place of the injured MS Dhoni.

'I don't think that's even a thing of debate,' said Kohli. 'The bouncer is a part of cricket and it is every bowler's right to utilise it.'

'If and when it is involved in our plans, we will use it. I don't think we will drift away from our plans. 

Kohli has been deeply affected by Hughes’ death, and was closer to the Australian than most in the India side.

He said: 'After attending the funeral I was as emotional and as taken aback by the incident, because Phil was one of the guys I used to interact with when he used to come on tours and even in Australia. I did a camp with him in 2008 in Brisbane so I knew him from then. It was an equally saddening and emotional moment for me as well.

'But as professional cricketers you have to move on and do what needs to be done, and move on to the next thing you have to do, which is play a Test match.'

The Adelaide crowd will pay tribute to Hughes on Tuesday with spectators being asked to stand for 63 seconds of applause before the match begins.

Hughes was 63 not out when he was struck by a short-pitched delivery at the SCG on November 25.

The Australian players will also wear Hughes' Test cap No 408 on their shirts.
