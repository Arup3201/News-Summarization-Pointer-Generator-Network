While there have been reports of TSA agents stealing valuable items from travellers bags, it was one agent's extra-curricular activity that got him arrested on Wednesday.

Bryant Jermaine Livingston, 39, was arrested during his shift at Washington, D.C.'s Dulles airport for his alleged involvement with a prostitution ring.

Court documents say that he was the mastermind behind a group sex tryst that took place in a Maryland hotel room the day after Valentine's Day.

Arrested: Bryant Livingston, 39, was charged with five counts relating to prostitution after he was caught organizing a group sex event on February 15

The manager of the Silver Spring Crowne Plaza Hotel became suspicious when Livingston repeatedly came down to the lobby- as he was the only one with key card access to the elevator- to get groups of men who were waiting there.

This raised a red flag for the manager because she recognized Livingston from prior visits to the hotel and 'because this behavior is not typical of Crowne Plaza Hotel guests,' according to the affidavit.

The manager then called police to report suspected prostitution activity, and they escorted to the room Livingston had rented out.

When he opened it, he denied that prostitution was taking place and invited officers inside.Instead, he said that he had posted an ad on Craigslist for a swingers party.

There, they found 11 people including 'three naked females and four males attempting to get dressed'.

'Multiple people were laying on the two beds, and other people were sitting in chairs and standing in the room,' the report states.

Work: Since 2002, Livingston had worked for the TSA at Dulles International Airport just outside of Washington, D.C.

Upon questioning, one of the men said that he paid Livingston $100 to participate in the tryst.

Though he was promptly fired and denies the charges, it is not the first time that Livingston, who worked for the TSA since 2002, has received a prostitution-related complaint.

It is not clear whether any charges were filed following the 2009 incident, but a TSA official told police that the 'very similar' complaint 'alleged that Livingston was operating a prostitution ring and charging individuals $25 for sexual acts'.

Again, Livingston denies any wrongdoing, saying that the TSA is out to get him and he plans to file a racial discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Unusual behavior: A manager at the Silver Springs Crowne Plaza Hotel called police because she suspected something when Livingston kept going down to the lobby to collect waiting men

The TSA said in a statement that they were cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation.

'The allegations against this individual are unacceptable and in no way reflect the integrity and professionalism of the more than 50,000 security officers who strive every day to ensure the security of the traveling public,' they said in the statement.

Regardless of his plans, Livingston stands charged with five counts relating to prostitution and is due to appear in court on May 8.
