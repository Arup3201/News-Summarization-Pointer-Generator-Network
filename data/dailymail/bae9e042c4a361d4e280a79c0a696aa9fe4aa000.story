They say Photoshop can do anything.

And this artist has pretty much proved that theory.

Taking a detailed close-up shot of a 100-year-old Vietnamese woman, YouTube user PhotoshopSurgeon reverse-aged her into a 30-year-old.

The computer trickery has gone viral.

Selecting the freely available image, taken by photographer Bùi Linh Ngân, PhotoshopSurgeon said they wanted to see how far they could push the limits of the Adobe program. 

Evidently, quite far.

'I chose her because I think she looks fascinating and endearing,' PhotoshopSurgeon told BuzzFeed of the video, which was posted online in 2013 but gained a recent surge of popularity.

Tweaking: Using lightening and adjustment tools, the artist started to clear the wrinkles from her face

Nip n' tuck: The woman's eyebrows are lifted up, lips made more plump, and skin made smoother 

Brightened: Her eyes are brightened, her smile crease made more faint, and eyelashes made more defined

'I wondered if I could reverse time and give people a glimpse of how she might have looked when she was young.'

The artist added: 'Some people say that the video made them cry, I think because it brings up memories of lost loved ones or conflicted feelings about aging that all of us end up experiencing.' 

Angry commenters raged that the woman is already beautiful. 

PhotoshopSurgeon responded that the video was an experiment not intended to 'improve' the woman's appearance. 

Full sweep: Towards the end, PhotoshopSurgeon focuses on her forehead, clearing it of wrinkles

End product: She is given makeup including cheek tint, eyeliner, lip color, and more defined eyebrows
