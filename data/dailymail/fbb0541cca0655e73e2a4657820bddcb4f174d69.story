Australia's Formula One rookie Daniel Ricciardo is earning almost 29 times less than his Red Bull teammate, Germany's Sebastian Vettel.

Vettel came out number one on Business Book GP2014's list of highest paid Formula One drivers with an estimated salary of $31.7 million, belittling Ricciardo's pay check of $1.1 million - which put him 15th on the list.

But the wages are not reflective of the current Formula One Standings where Ricciardo is in third place on 131 points, separating him from Vettel - in sixth place - by 43 points, according to News.com.au.

Per point Ricciardo is worth $8,369 compared to Vettel who costing Red Bull $360,227 every point he earns.In the earnings stakes, Spain's Fernando Alonso and Finland's Kimi Raikkonen shared the top spot with Vettel.

This means Alonso is being paid out $275,652 per point by Ferrari while teammate Raikkonen is raking it in with each of his points worth $1.17 million.

If this disparity in pay cheques causes any trouble between the teammates, it will not be the first time Vettel has caused a stir in the garage.

Before Australian Mark Webber retired, Vettel usurped the veteran driver as number one driver for Red Bull.

Ironically it now appears Daniel Ricciardo looks to do the same if his impressive performance on the Formula One Standings continue.

The 25-year-old, from Perth, was promoted this season from Red Bull's secondary team, Scuderia Toro Rosso.

His latest success was at the Hungarian leg of the Formula One Grand Prix where he took out first place.

Despite the pay gap, Ricciardo is performing better in the Formula One Standings than Vettel this year
