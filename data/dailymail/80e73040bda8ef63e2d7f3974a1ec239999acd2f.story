David Cameron today said he would be heart broken if Scotland voted for independence.

The Prime Minister, speaking in Perth, told Scottish Tories the campaign to keep the UK together was 'an issue of the heart'.

He said: 'It would break my heart to see our United Kingdom break apart.' Mr Cameron the ‘silent majority’ who reject Scottish independence to stand up against nationalist bullyboys.

Voters in Scotland are due to decide whether Scotland stays in the Union in an independence referendum on September 18.

Mr Cameron said: 'If Scotland walks away from the United Kingdom and votes for separation, it's not for a trial period, it would be permanent.'

He said: 'Why is it suddenly a good idea to make your sister working in Edinburgh or your brother working in London living in a foreign country?

'Why is it suddenly a good idea to split away from the organisations that have helped this country be everything it is in our world today?

'I don't think they have made a powerful case at all and I think they have left every single key question unanswered.'

Mr Cameron said there is no certainty about what currency an independent Scotland would use, if it would be a member of both the European Union and Nato, and what the costs of leaving the UK would be.

'None of the key questions have been answered," Mr Cameron insisted.

'It's extraordinary when you think how long Alex Salmond has planned this moment. He's had years to think of the answers but yet with 77 days to go you can see he is Alex the unready - not a clue about the enormous gamble he would be taking with our nation's future.'

The Prime Minister insisted the ‘noise of the nationalist few’ risks drowning out those with a quiet, deep belief in the future of the United Kingdom.

He accused the Scottish government of using ‘threats and warnings’ to try to prevent business chiefs speaking out about the dangers of voting for independence in a referendum due to take place on September 18. 

There has been increasing scrutiny of the tactics used by an army of so-called ‘cybernats’ - nationalist internet bullies who pour bile over anyone who dares to oppose their cause.

Author J K Rowling was branded ‘w***e’, a ‘c***’ and a ‘union cow’ on Twitter last month after giving £1 million to the ‘no’ campaign and urging Scots to stay in the UK.

After Bill Munro, founder of the firm Barrhead Travel, warned of the ‘impending disaster’ of a ‘yes’ vote, the cybernats took to social media sites to insist they would never use his firm again.

At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘A huge amount of pressure is being put on businesses by the Scottish Government, with all sorts of threats and warnings against speaking out and saying what they believe is the truth.

‘I come across business leader after business leader - large and small in Scotland - who wants to keep our United Kingdom together and thinks it would be crazy to have border controls, different currencies and split up our successful United Kingdom.

‘I urge them to speak out, talk with their work forces about the strength of our United Kingdom and then vote to keep it together.’

Mr Cameron, who has Scottish ancestry, said he would be left 'heartbroken' if the country voted to leave the UK 

First Minister Alex Salmond, who met the Queen at Holryroodhouse this week, has seen support for independence fall to just 35 per cent in recent polls

Nearly half of Scots believe Alex Salmond should resign if he loses September's referendum, according to a new poll.

Even a quarter of those who voted for the SNP in 2011 think the First Minister should stand down, the figures suggest.

But Mr Salmond has already insisted that he plans to stand at the next Holyrood election, regardless of the referendum result.

'Whatever the political circumstances, there will be an election in 2016 and the people will choose the First Minister,' he said recently.

However, the Scottish Daily Mail revealed that one high-profile Nationalist said: 'If there is a No vote, Salmond is gone.

'It doesn't matter how close the result is. If we lose, he will have failed and will stand aside. That is certain.' Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is the only obvious candidate to succeed Mr Salmond and earlier this year she finally admitted she would like the top job. 

The YouGov poll shows that 45 per cent of Scots believe Mr Salmond should resign if the country rejects independence, and 41 per cent believe he should continue as First Minister.

Among Yes supporters, about 12 per cent believe that Mr Salmond should stand down in this scenario, rising to 24 per cent of those who voted SNP at the 2011 election.

The poll also shows that only a third of Scots believe the online debate about independence has been conducted in a 'polite and respectful' manner.  Thirty-two per cent of respondents said online supporters of the Yes campaign are 'mostly' or 'almost entirely' rude and aggressive. Meanwhile, 21 per cent said the same of No supporters.

Addressing a rally in Scotland today, Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ve heard the noise of the nationalist few, but now it is time for the voices of the silent majority to be heard,’ he is expected to say.

‘The silent majority who feel happy being part of the UK; the silent majority who don’t want the risks of going it alone; the silent majority who worry about what separation would mean for their children and grandchildren.'

Mr Cameron will add: ‘With 77 days to go, we need the voices of the many to ring out across the land. For each one to realise that they are not alone because there are millions just like them.

‘And this is how we rouse them to find their voice. We tell them: we’ve achieved so much together; we’re safer together; we’re better off together; we’ve got the best of both worlds together.

‘And finally let’s tell them this: You can be proudly Scottish and want to stay in the UK.

‘Too many people in this country have been made to feel that you can’t be a proud Scot and say “no thanks”. You’ve got to choose between the Saltire and the Union flag.

‘That is wrong. Loving your country means wanting the best for it – and for Scotland that is staying in the UK. So yes – you can be a patriotic Scot and vote no.’ 

Blair Jenkins, chief executive of the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign, said: ‘David Cameron is seriously out of touch if he thinks there is a silent majority in Scotland in favour of the Tories and their austerity agenda. 

'The reality is there is a very vocal majority against David Cameron governing Scotland, with just a single Tory MP here.

‘Thanks to the Westminster system, another 30,000 children in Scotland have been pushed into poverty because of Tory welfare cuts - yet the Westminster parties want to spend up to £4 billion a year on new Trident nuclear weapons. 

'Nothing better illustrates the need for a Yes vote in September, so that we can put bairns before bombs.’

Business for Scotland chief executive Gordon MacIntyre-Kemp said: ‘David Cameron is repeating the same old tired UK line about businesses being afraid to speak up but business people across Scotland are already speaking up and don’t feel at all intimidated.

‘The Prime Minister… might be having difficulty getting businesses to speak up for no because the message they’re trying to sell is simply not credible.’

Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond yesterday claimed that rejecting independence would leave Scotland subject to public spending cuts.

‘Anything other than a vote for independence would be a vote for continuing Conservative austerity, no matter which Westminster party wins the 2015 election,’ he wrote in a letter to Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

But a spokesman for the Treasury said: ‘It is not credible for [Mr Salmond] to suggest that Scotland’s finances would be stronger as a separate country. Every independent expert forecaster agrees that a separate Scotland would have a deficit double the size the UK’s.’

The latest polls suggest the no campaign maintains a strong lead. A YouGov poll this week showed 54 per cent of Scots intend to vote no to independence, and 35 per cent yes, with 11 per cent undecided.
