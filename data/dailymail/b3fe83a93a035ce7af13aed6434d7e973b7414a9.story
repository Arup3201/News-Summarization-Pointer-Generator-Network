These incredible photographs show free divers exploring the depths of the ocean, while coming scarily close to some of the water's most deadliest predators.

The images are the work of Alex Roubaud and Alex Voyer, from Paris, France, who have been free diving as a hobby for the past 10 years.

The French duo - both 36 - have travelled the world and delved into some of the most remote waters alongside potentially frightening creatures such as the great white shark.

Up close and personal: French duo Roubaud and Voyer have been free diving together for over 10 years

The two 36-year-olds have explored some of the most remote waters in the world, photographing extremely rare creatures

Alex Voyer said: 'Free diving is our passion, we have been doing it for about 10 years now. 

'We just try to travel whenever we have some time and money.

'Sharks are generally shy and curious, we almost never feel afraid or nervous when we swim with them. 

Under the sea: The divers claim that they enjoy swimming with smaller fish because they tend to be quite interactive

Unbelievable encounters: Here, one of the deep sea divers is photographed alongside a gigantic whale shark

No fear! The divers are not afraid to get very close with great white sharks 

'We need to be very calm, but they are not the terrifying animals we imagine them to be, just a wild animal.

'Of course I can feel afraid in the ocean, especially when there is no visibility - even if there are no animals around.

'I think it is certainly due to the Jaws movie - but when the water is clear, there is absolutely no problem.' 

Alex Voyer says: 'Sharks are generally shy and curious, we almost never feel afraid or nervous when we swim with them'

Voyer and Roubaud explain that while you need to be careful, great whites are not the terrifying creatures we imagine them to be

In fact, the two even attribute people's nervousness around the creatures to the Jaws film franchise

The divers do admit to being more afraid in dark water, but if the water is clear, they have no problems

The stunning collection of images were taken during trips to widespread locations, including the Maldives, Guadalup Island in Mexico, Azores Island and Colombia.

And the pair have witnessed first hand the beauty of some of other, perhaps less dangerous, animals - including blue sharks, whale sharks, leopard seals and hordes of fish.

Alex said: 'I do not know if I could pick a favourite animal - I like them all. I can have a great time playing with an octopus, or seeing a school of little fish.

The images were taken over the course of several years during trips taken to variety of locations 

Together, the pair have gone free diving in the Maldives, Guadalup Island in Mexico, Azores Island and Colombia

Wildlife fanatics: 'I don't know if I can pick a favourite animal,' Voyer says. 'I like them all!'

'But the big ones are certainly much more impressive, purely for their size.

'For example, though a whale shark is not really interactive, they are so big that they inspire a great force. Whereas some little fish can be much more interactive.

'Diving with marine mammals is great - it is almost like we can understand them.' 

'Diving with marine mammals is great,' they say. 'It's almost like we can understand them.'

'Whale snarks are not that interactive,' Voyer explains. 'But they inspire a great force.'

Though great whites are stunning, Voyer insists: 'I can have a great time playing with an octopus, or even seeing a school of little fish'

Passion: The French duo hope to continue this hobby for many more years to come

Simply stunning! The diver's fluid movements are a gorgeous contrast to the majestic whale shark

It's important to stay calm when swimming alongside some of the world's most dangerous predators

Among the other animals that the pair have come across are blue sharks, whale sharks, leopard seals and hordes of fish
