Dejan Lovren can be a future Liverpool captain, according to former defender Jamie Carragher.

The £20million summer signing from Southampton was considered one of the best centre backs in the Premier League last season before he picked up an ankle injury.

And Sportsmail columnist Carragher believes that Lovren could replace Steven Gerrard as captain when the Kop Idol eventually hangs up his boots.

And speaking to The Liverpool Echo, Carragher says 25-year-old is a good signing: ‘Centre-backs normally make great captains.

'I think if Lovren establishes himself in the team became a top player by showing the same form he has at Southampton for Liverpool, then in the next few years when Stevie does decide to call it day he will be in contention.

'You look at him and he has the potential to make a big powerful impact at the back and that’s what Liverpool need.’

'Jordan Henderson is another who could possibly be in contention and there will be more who arrive in that time that could be up for it as well.

'But if Lovren can come in and produce that sort of form then I am sure he will be in the running for it.'

And Carragher believes that Brendan Rodgers has pulled off a transfer coup by signing the defender who made a number of impressive performances last season.

Leading the way: Carragher says Lovren could replace Steven Gerrard as captain 

He added: ‘I saw him at Anfield when Southampton travelled there and I saw him against Manchester United as well and he was outstanding in both games.

'He got the winner at Anfield – I remember that well.

'But he looks like an organiser and he looks like a leader.’

'He did suffer with a few injury problems in the second-half of the campaign and that coincided with Southampton tailing off a touch but definitely in the first-half he was playing as well as anybody in his position.’
