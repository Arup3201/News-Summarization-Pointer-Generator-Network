European Central Bank head Mario Draghi says the bank is ready to intervene in the bond market to drive down countries' high borrowing rates, and urged European leaders to get their bailout fund ready to intervene as well.

Draghi said today the bank could buy bonds if the borrowing rates stop the ECB in its efforts to spread its low interest rates throughout the 17 countries that use the currency.

Such a move could, crucially, lower the borrowing rates that are threatening to push Spain and Italy into financial disaster.

Mario Draghi said today the bank could buy bonds if the borrowing rates stop the ECB in its efforts to spread its low interest rates throughout the 17 countries that use the currency

At a meeting earlier today Draghi 
indicated that any ECB intervention would start at the earliest in 
September and would depend on countries in trouble on bond markets 
making a request and accepting strict conditions and supervision.

He also indicated that German central 
bank chief Jens Weidmann had expressed reservations about bond-buying 
and further efforts would be needed to persuade the Bundesbank before a 
final vote to take action.

At a news conference following the 
central bank's monthly meeting, Draghi said the bank would consider 
other 'non-standard' measures to rein in the euro zone crisis.

'The Governing Council, within its 
mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term and in 
observance of its independence in determining monetary policy, may 
undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach 
its objective,' Draghi said after the bank kept euro zone interest rates
at a record low 0.75 percent.

The bank has already spent 210 billion
euros buying bonds under its now dormant Securities Markets Programme 
(SMP) since May 2010, with limited impact, but Draghi said the new 
effort would be different in scope and conditionality.

Any new ECB action was conditional on euro zone governments using their EFSF and ESM bail out funds first, he said.

Calling for action: U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the euro zone must cut borrowing costs

'Governments must stand ready to 
activate the ESM/EFSF in the bond market when exceptional financial 
market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist,' he said.

Financial markets seemed underwhelmed 
by the announcements, with some investors having interpreted Draghi's 
comments last week as a sign of imminent rather than future and 
conditional action.

Draghi said all members of the Governing Council endorsed today's statement with one exception - a reference to Bundsbank president Jens Weidmann

'It is quite disappointing ... There 
is a lack of any action so he has basically passed the buck back on to 
politicians,' said Ioan Smith, strategist at Knight Capital.

German bund futures extended gains, a 
sign of investors seeking safety, and the euro fell by more than one 
cent to below $1.22 at 1330 GMT.

Other countries, especially the United States, have sought to raise pressure on the ECB to act over the Euro crisis.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the euro zone must take steps to bring down borrowing costs in troubled member states.

His comments in London last Thursday 
that the ECB would do whatever it takes within its mandate to protect 
the currency bloc from collapse - 'and believe me, it will be enough' - 
had already eased tensions on the debt markets.

Other countries, especially the 
United States, have raised pressure on the ECB to act as the 
two-and-a-half year old euro zone crisis weighs on global growth.

The U.S. Federal Reserve dashed 
expectations among some investors on Wednesday by taking no immediate 
new measures to revive the economy.

The Fed stopped short of offering new 
monetary stimulus, though it signalled more strongly that further bond 
buying could be in store to help a U.S. economic recovery that it said 
had lost momentum this year.

The future is bleak: Experts warn of months of uncertainty for the euro zone

ECB action, meanwhile, is hamstrung by
EU rules forbidding it from financing governments. The ECB issued a 
legal opinion in March 2011 ruling out perhaps the biggest gun, giving 
the ESM bailout fund rights to tap the ECB for funds to increase its 
firepower.

The ECB also has to find a way to get 
any measures past Germany, the euro zone's largest economy and its 
principal paymaster. The Bundesbank issues regular reminders of 
inflationary dangers stemming from non-standard measures such as bond 
purchases and the limits central banks face.

Draghi said all members of the 
Governing Council endorsed Thursday's statement with one exception - a 
reference to Bundsbank president Jens Weidmann.

'The decision to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro as a stable currency has been unanimous,' Draghi said.

'It's clear and it's known that 
(Germany's) Bundesbank have their reservations about the programme of 
buying bonds. The idea is we now have the guidance, the monetary policy 
committee, the risk committee and the markets committee will work on 
this guidance and then (we) will take a final decision and the votes 
will be counted.'

His wording suggested he was prepared to outvote the German central banker if necessary.
