The Sydney siege has thrown a spotlight on the disturbing growth of terror threats in Australia in recent months, with one expert claiming that the country is being targeted because it is a 'soft target'.

'I suspect that cities in Australia or Canada are seen as relatively soft targets, compared with London where you can't turn a corner without seeing a heavily armed policeman nowadays,' said historian Michael Burleigh.

In September, Australian police carried out the largest counter-terrorism raids in the country's history, after uncovering an alleged plot to behead a member of the public just yards away from the Lindt cafe that is currently under siege.

Australia has sent hundreds of special forces advisers to Iraq to assist in the struggle against ISIS, adding it to a list of countries thought to be at increased risk of terror attacks.

It is unknown whether the gunman holding hostages at the Lindt cafe is a 'lone wolf', part of an organised terror cell.

In November, ISIS released an audio message purportedly from its self-styled Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, calling for jihadists to carry out 'lone wolf' attacks against Muslim Shi'ite and Westerners all over the world. 

He singled out Australia, Europe, America, and Canada as targets, saying the West had launched a 'slanderous' media campaign against ISIS 'to reduce its supporters and followers.' 

'Dismember their limbs; snatch them as groups and individuals,' he said. 'Erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere'.

In September, more than 800 police officers carried out raids in Sydney's north-west, detaining 15 people.

Bundles of cash and a curved sword inscribed with black foreign lettering were some of the incriminating pieces of evidence removed from a Sydney home during the terror raids.

According to NBC, the raids were believed to be linked to the death of 33-year-old Mohammad Ali Baryalei, Australia's most senior known member of ISIS, who was reportedly killed in Syria.

Shortly afterwards, an ISIS spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, urged Muslims in Australia to carry out lone-wolf terror attacks, saying that they should 'not let this battle pass you by' and kill an Australian civilian or soldier — or 'any other disbeliever' — in 'any manner or way', reported NBC. 

At the time, Channel Seven reported that the random beheading was intended to be carried out in the streets of Martin Place in Sydney's central business district - the location of the Lindt cafe.

According to ABC, the abducted member of the public would be draped in an Islamic State flag and beheaded on camera. This raises fresh fears for the hostages held inside the Lindt cafe, one of whom has been filmed drawing her hand across her throat in fear.

The fact that the same location was selected for both operations raises questions about the security arrangements at the site. 

Professor Jeff Lewis, a terrorism expert at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, said that Martin Place and the Lindt cafe had been chosen 'because it would get maximum publicity' and because it represented the spoils of Western society.

Martin Place is one of Sydney's most high-profile shopping precincts with upmarket restaurants, cafes and bars, high-end fashion boutiques and designer shops including Giorgio Armani. It is also the location of the Channel Seven Network office, assuring the terrorist of almost instantaneous media coverage.

Although five hostages have escaped from the Lindt cafe, fears are mounting about the 15 people that remain inside.

Hostages have been seen with their hands pressed against the windows holding up the flag of extremist group Jabhat al-Nusra, which is fighting the Assad government in Syria.

The Wall Street Journal reports that many Islamic leaders attribute the extremism among some Australian Muslims to an event in December 2005.

A fight between young Muslim men and two white lifeguards on a suburban beach near Sydney led to a demonstration. About 5,000 non-Muslims attended, some chanting racist slogans. According to the Wall Street Journal, this mob then 'viciously attacked dark-skinned beachgoers'.

This led to a spate of street violence carried out by gangs of young people 'of Arab descent'.

About 476,000 Muslims live in Australia, many of them refugees of the unrest in Lebanon in the 1970s and 1980s. Many are relatively wealthy and have assimilated into Australian society. 

The current hostage crisis is the culmination of a steady escalation of terror activity in Australia, where all the signs have been indicating that the threat of Islamic extremism is worsening.

Shortly after police swooped on terror targets in September, an 18-year-old jihadi stabbed two police officers in Melbourne. 

In October, Julie Bishop, Australia's Foreign Minister, revealed that 'at least 70 Australians are in Iraq and Syria fighting with the terrorist organisations now'.

About 185 Australians are known to be involved with extremists in the Middle East, she said, an increase from about 150 in recent months. This number includes those who are supporting such organisations through activities such as recruitment and funding.

David Livingstone, Associate Fellow on the International Security Programme at the think tank Chatham House, said that nevertheless, the Sydney attack is a 'wake-up call' that will reverberate around the world.

'People hitherto have thought Australia to be a relatively safe place from this threat of terror,' he said.

'In Britain the threat is much more serious than in Australia, and yet we see this happening. A lot of people will be sitting up and taking notice now.'

In response to this burgeoning threat, Australia has been aggressively tightening its anti-terror legislation to counter the threat of Islamist terror on its own shores.

In November, the Senate  passed legislation which also allowed the Australian Federal Police to issue 'control orders' for people suspected of supporting or facilitating foreign fighters.

This was a controversial move, as it allowed police to detain suspects without charge. 

The new laws enabled the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) to conduct counter-terrorism activities in Iraq without having to wait for written approval by a senior minister.

It also changed the means by which the foreign minister, who is responsible for ASIS, authorises the agency to undertake activities relating to a 'class of Australian persons' rather than individuals. 

Attorney-General George Brandis said the orders were not about punishment but preventing terrorist attacks.

'We're talking about terrorism here. We're talking about the destruction of lives, the destruction of property,' he told parliament.

'Once the conduct has occurred, it's too late.'

There are concerns that the increased terror threat, coupled with the toughening up of the law enforcement's response, will lead to a polarisation of society that may turn violent.

About 70 men have had their passports confiscated in recent months, based on the suspicion that they were planning to fly to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS, authorities have said.

And on Monday, Australian Federal Police arrested a 25-year-old man from Sydney on suspicion of financing terrorism. It is not thought that there is a link between that arrest and the Lindt cafe siege.

Tony Abbott, Australia's prime minister, said: 'The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves.

'We have to appreciate that even in a society such as ours, that there are people who would wish to do us harm. 

'That's why we have police and security organizations of the utmost professionalism that are ready and able to respond to a whole range of situations.' 

In an effort to alleviate growing tensions, 50 Muslim organisations have released a statement of condemnation.

'Our immediate thoughts go to the hostages and their loved ones,' it says. 'We pray for their safety and hope this matter is resolved quickly and peacefully.

'We reject any attempt to take the innocent life of any human being, or to instill fear and terror into the hearts.

'Any such despicable act only serves to play into the agendas of those who seek to destroy the goodwill of the people of Australia and to further damage, and ridicule the religion of Islam, and Australian Muslims throughout this country.'

Australians also used social media to express their outrage, as well as their solidarity with their Muslim compatriots, in an attempt to counter fears that the hostage crisis would spark a cycle of tit-for-tat violence.

On Twitter, the hashtag #illridewithyou quickly started trending, reflecting Australians' view that Muslims should not be treated with suspicion on public transport in the wake of the Lindt cafe attack.
