Spark: The shooting of Mark Duggan cause some of the worst rioting seen in more than a generation

New footage has emerged of the aftermath of the police shooting that triggered last summer's riots.

Mark Duggan was killed during a 
pre-planned operation involving officers from the Metropolitan Police's 
Trident gun crime unit in Tottenham, north London, on August 4.

The video, obtained by the BBC, was filmed by someone who says they witnessed the shooting.

It shows attempts by paramedics to save Mr Duggan's life as well as footage of his body covered by a red blanket.

An audio expert has told the 
broadcaster that the witness can be heard on the tape saying: 'He jumped out and then he's took 
him out,' according to the BBC which has obtained a copy of 
the footage.

The Independent Complaints Commission 
is still carrying out an investigation into the circumstances of the 
shooting, with an inquiry into his death failing to establish the 
sequence of events concerning a handgun found at the scene.

The watchdog has condemned the BBC's decision to broadcast the footage before it has seen it.

IPCC Commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: 'The IPCC is conducting a sensitive investigation of considerable public interest.

'Given this, it is particularly 
disappointing that BBC News did not afford us the opportunity to view 
this footage in advance of broadcast, despite our repeated requests.

'Broadcasting this footage is likely 
to have caused considerable distress to Mr Duggan's family, friends and 
the local community, in addition to potentially prejudicing our 
investigation and any legal process that may follow.

Aftermath: The new video captures potentially important information about the shooting of Mark Duggan

Tensions: Within days of the shooting, public outrage exploded into massive disorder, looting and rioting

'We have asked the BBC to pass our 
contact details to the witness and would urge them to come forward.

'We 
fully expect BBC News to now pass us the unedited footage so we are able
to fully assess its implications.

The video, which appears to have been 
filmed through a window of a building opposite the scene from several 
storeys up, begins after the shooting.

An air ambulance can be seen hovering 
overhead as paramedics attempt to revive Mr Duggan near the grey people 
carrier taxi he was travelling in.

The taxi is blocked in by an unmarked police car and an ambulance is parked nearby.

The witness provides occasional commentary of what has happened and recounts the moments before the filming began.

The BBC has used an actor to relay these comments to protect the source of the video, who wishes to be anonymous.

Shock: The scene on Ferry Lane, Tottenham, become a focus for public grief over the shooting of Mark Duggan

According to the audio analyst, the 
witness says on the tape: 'They blocked him in, they blocked him in.

'He 
jumped out... And then he's taken out, shot him... because I heard them 
shout at him yeah, "Put it down, put it down".'

A BBC spokeswoman said Mr Duggan's family were aware that the footage would be shown on television.

'The BBC is fully aware of the 
sensitivities around this story and ensured that Mark Duggan's family 
were informed about the footage before it was broadcast.

'Requests for BBC un-transmitted 
material are dealt through our legal department, regardless of the 
subject matter. We require requests for un-transmitted material to be 
made through the courts.'

Impact: Mark Duggan's family, seen attending his funeral, complained to the IPCC they were not given enough information about the circumstances surrounding his shooting in the immediate aftermath 

Mass disorder: Police relations with local communities have suffered significant damage since the shooting 

Eruption: Two days after Duggan died, the Tottenham riots exploded after his family
spent five frustrating hours seeking a meeting and explanation from 
local police chief

Both the IPCC and Scotland Yard have 
admitted mishandling the way they dealt with Mr Duggan's family in the 
aftermath of the shooting.

Initial reports that Mr Duggan shot at
police were dismissed by ballistic tests which later found that a 
bullet which lodged itself in one officer's radio was police issue.

Police failed to formally notify the family of his death, giving his parents, Pamela Duggan and Bruno Hall, false hope.

Relatives subsequently complained about their treatment, which was upheld by the IPCC.

A coroner's officer has said a 
provisional date of January 28 2013 has been set for Mr Duggan's inquest
- but only if the eight-week inquest is given the go-ahead during a 
review on October 23.

An alternative could be a special inquiry where some evidence is heard behind closed doors, it is understood.
