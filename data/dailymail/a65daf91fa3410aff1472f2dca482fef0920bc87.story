Russell Slade watched from the stands as Cardiff ended their victory drought with a 2-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday.

Sean Morrison had put the Bluebirds ahead only to bring the visitors level by putting through his own net early in the second half.

But Anthony Pilkington's excellent control and right-foot finish gave the Welsh club the spoils for the first time in seven games.

Josh Murphy celebrates with Nathan Redmond as Norwich make it 3-1 at Blackpool on Saturday

Two goals in a minute from Lewis Grabban and Josh Murphy ensured Norwich came from behind to beat Blackpool 3-1 at Bloomfield Road and move to the top of the Championship table.

The hosts took the lead through Nathan Delfouneso's close range finish on 46 minutes, but a Donervon Daniels own goal levelled, before Grabban notched on 80 minutes and Murphy sealed the win 60 seconds later.

And Norwich replaced Nottingham Forest on top of the Championship after Brighton held them to a goalless draw at the City Ground.

The Reds have beaten Brighton only once in the last eight meetings between the two sides - and Stuart Pearce's side rarely looked like adding to that tally on Saturday.

With Norwich's win at Blackpool, Forest slipped down into second place in the table, following a game in which they rarely found their attacking threat.

Blackburn fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Watford.

Matej Vydra and Daniel Tozser put the Hornets 2-0 up at the break but Rudy Gestede and Ryan Tunnicliffe responded in the second half for the hosts to earn a point.

Wigan's abject away form continued as they suffered a 2-0 defeat to Bournemouth - their fourth defeat in five league games on the road this campaign.

Chris Martin bagged a brace as Derby recorded a second successive away win, beating Bolton 2-0, while two goals in the opening six minutes helped Ipswich beat Rotherham by the same scoreline as they recorded a fourth league win in a row.
