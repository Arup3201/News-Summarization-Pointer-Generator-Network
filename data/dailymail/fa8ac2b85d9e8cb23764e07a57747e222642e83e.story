The staff association representing a police officer who is suing a suspected burglary victim has defended her and said it had 'failed to prepare her'.

PC Kelly Jones, 33, is taking legal action against garage owner Steve Jones, 50 after she fell on a kerb while attending a suspected break-in.

Lawyers claim Mr Jones was at fault for failing to ensure the officer was 'reasonably safe', making no attempt to light the area or warn her about the step when she went to the incident in Thetford, Norfolk, in August last year.

The case has caused controversy and strong reactions.

investigating a break-in

Steve Williams, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales came to the constable’s aid.

He said: 'It is important that the public understand that police officers are not financially compensated by their own force for injuries received on duty and in fact can lose money through half pay and reduction in allowances.

'It may also affect their future prospects concerning promotion, specialisation and in some cases their continuation in their job.

'There is no distinction between on and off duty injury or illness and whilst the Government may wish to reduce litigation culture, there must be some alternative put in place.

'Let me be clear - to vilify this female officer is wrong.

WPC Jones tripped while investigating the break in at the Nunns Bridges Service Station in Thetford, Norfolk. Owner Steve Jones said it is example of the 'fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident'

'She took legal advice as to how she could claim back some of her lost earnings as a result of the injury, and at this stage no formal proceedings have taken place.

'She has been supported by my own organisation, the Police Federation, who have agreed to fund her on a conditional fee basis should the matter progress.

'In my view it is actually we that 
should be looking at our processes and structures in terms of how we 
provide advice - she is our member and I feel that our organisation has 
failed to prepare her for the wider personal impact that might arise 
from such a claim.

'This is regardless of her right to take this action in law, and the merits of the case which I am not able to discuss.'

Mr Williams said the Police Federation’s structure was being independently reviewed.

He added: 'While PC Jones may be an easy
target as she is one individual within a media storm, for me it is the 
Police Federation that needs to be mindful of the widespread public and 
member perception that has arisen out of this claim, and address that 
where relevant in our advice going forward.'

The officer’s father, Danny Harle, 
earlier said his daughter would drop the lawsuit after being upset at 
the strong reaction it prompted.

Mr Harle, 58, told the Daily Mirror she felt she had been 'persecuted'.

He added: 'All she did was follow standard police procedure.

'There was never any mention of figures.

'She was expecting a couple of grand, not £50,000.

'Kelly wants to drop the claim to prove she’s not a money-grabber, not because she feels she’s done anything wrong.'

Yesterday PC Jones’s boss, Chief Constable Phil Gormley spoke of his 'disappointment' over the matter.

Mr Gormley said: 'This type of claim does not represent the approach and attitude of the overwhelming majority of our staff who understand and accept the risks inherent in policing and which they willingly confront to keep the public they serve safe.

'It is a disappointment that this is potentially undermined by a private compensation claim.'

A Norfolk Constabulary spokesman said yesterday: 'This legal action is not supported by the Constabulary, our understanding being that the action is funded and supported by the Police Federation, a position over which the Constabulary has no control.'

PC Jones and Mr Jones were checking the outside of the building after an alarm had gone off, when she is alleged to have fallen and injured herself.

A letter from her law firm Pattinson Brewer, seven months after the incident, claims she injured her left leg and right wrist and went to the West Suffolk Hospital.

Further questions also remain over the role of the Police Federation in brokering the civil legal action by one of its members.

The Daily Mail revealed 
frontline officers are receiving millions of pounds every year from 
personal injury claims from a Police Federation-backed service.

Lawyers behind the free claimline boast they have recovered £42million 
in the last two years alone after suing over slips and trips, workplace 
accidents and negligence.

Stephen Bett, Norfolk’s police and crime commissioner, said WPC Jones’s behaviour was ‘appalling’ and ‘leaves me cold’.

He said: ‘Of course, there are officers who deserve to receive help when
they are injured in the course of duty and the public would readily 
support this. WPC Jones, I suspect, is not one of them.’

Henry Bellingham, Tory MP for North West Norfolk, called on the Home Secretary to ‘get a grip’ of the situation immediately.

He said: ‘Will a firefighter sue because they don’t like flames or a 
paramedic because they can’t stand blood? This threatens the fabric of 
our emergency services.

‘The public need to know they can have confidence that the police will investigate a crime without trying to sue them.’
