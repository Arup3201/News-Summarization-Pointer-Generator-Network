Police are hunting for a missing beauty queen due to fly to London later this week for Miss World 2014.

Reigning Miss Honduras Maria Jose Alvarado, 19, vanished with her sister Sofia  after a friend's birthday party in their home town of Santa Barbara, last Thursday.

Police have said the girls' disappearance is not being treated as a crime, but today it emerged four people, including her sister's boyfriend have been arrested.

The missing women were last seen getting into a vehicle as they left the party. Police chief Jose Coello originally said they were not treating the pair's disappearance as a crime, but confirmed the four arrests. 

'Four people are under arrest. They include the owner of the party venue and Sofia Trinidad's boyfriend. They are being investigated,' Mr Coello said. 

The case has caused consternation in the notoriously violent central American country, home to the most dangerous city on the planet.

San Pedro Sula, just over 30 miles from Santa Barbara, is the murder capital of the world with more than 1,200 killings a year among its nearly one million inhabitants.

Its murder rate of 169 per 100,000 people far surpasses anything in north America or much larger cities like Lagos or Sao Paulo.

Maria Jose describes herself on a Miss World website profile as an aspiring diplomat who enjoys playing volleyball and football in her spare time.

The Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, tops the list of the world's most violent places on earth.

At least three murders are reported each day in the coffee-exporting nation, mostly at the hands of vicious gangs and drug cartels who operate freely in an area of lawlessness, poverty and a decaying justice system.

Gunmen have taken control of slums and villages, well aware that the police are ineffective and corrupt.

San Pedro Sula recorded 1,218 homicides in 2012 (a rate of 3.3 murders a day). It was followed by Acapulco, Mexico; Caracas, Venezuela and Distrito Central, Honduras.

The same year, it was reported that San Pedro Sula is saddled with one of South America's weakest economies - and nearly 70 per cent of the population live in poverty.

She beat 18 contestants to win the Miss Honduras crown in April.

She missed an appointment yesterday evening/on Sunday evening to try on the dress she hopes to win Miss World with.

The women's mum Teresa de Jesus pleaded last night: 'Open your hearts and understand my pain.

'There is an all-powerful God that sees everything and I hope you set them free.' Miss World is due to kick off on Thursday, with 120 contestants competing for the crown.

The grand finale takes place on December 14 at ExCel London in the heart of the capital's Royal Docks area.

Swiss-born medical student Carina Tyrrell, 24, a qualified ski instructor and competition level gymnast, is representing England. 

Scotland is represented by media and marketing student Ellie McKeating, 20, from Glasgow. Ireland's representative is business studies student Jessica Hayes, 20, from Cork.
