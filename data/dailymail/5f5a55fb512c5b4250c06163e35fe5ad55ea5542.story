Invest in a meat probe, ice your cake a week before Christmas and serve a good Rioja with the turkey dinner.

These are the top Christmas tips from food experts including chef Marco Pierre White and French patissier Eric Lanlard. 

The duo, together with Mail On Sunday's wine columnist Olly Smith and cheese expert Charlie Turnbull, share their secrets for perfect Christmas banquet in P&O Cruises’ Christmas campaign.

Celebrity-worth dinner: Marco Pierre White advises to use a meat probe for the perfect turkey

The secret of cooking the perfect turkey? According to Pierre White you can’t do it without a meat probe.

He says: 'No bird in this world has its presence on the table like a turkey, it’s majestic. But the secret of cooking a perfect turkey ... is a meat probe.'

He adds: 'Christmas lunch without question is the most important lunch of the year, but lots of people panic, why because they don’t apply a strategy in what they’re doing.' 

And Lanlard advises home bakers not to to ice and decorate Christmas cakes too much in advance.

In the one-and-a-half-minute video, he says: 'When it comes to ice and decorate your Christmas cake, don’t do it too much in advance, just do it one week before Christmas. So the icing don’t change colour and so the icing don’t dry out.'

Cheese expert and judge Charlie Turnbull’s last-minute tip for top-notch Christmas canapes is to take a pop a spoonful of mincemeat into a canape case with a bit of grape and Stilton on top.  

'Bang it in the oven for a quick blast of heat and in five minutes, you’ll have a perfect canape for unexpected guests,' he suggests.

Or for the more adventurous, he advises: 'You probably haven’t tried this so just trust me, it’s really good. 

'Get a little bit of goat’s cheese have a little bit of honey on it, I know it sounds a bit odd but it really lifts it and it’s really light and pleasant once you’ve had all that heavy turkey and stuf... lovely way to finish a meal.' 

Stuck for ideas for which wine to serve with Christmas dinner? You can't go wrong with a Rioja, according to expert, Olly Smith.

And he adds, when it comes to leaving a tipple out for Santa, ditch the traditional sherry and go for something more modern.

Olly says in the footage: 'Father Christmas he’s such a great guy, but do you know what I think he must get a little bored of all the and sherry and the port that’s left out for him. 

'I think we should leave him the world’s best gin and tonic and my tip for doing that is to freeze the tonic water in an ice cube tray and then add it to the drink, as they dissolve they reinforce the flavour and Santa’s going to be delighted.'
