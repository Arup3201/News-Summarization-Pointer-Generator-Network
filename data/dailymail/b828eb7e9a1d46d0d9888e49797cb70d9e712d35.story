Andrew McNicholas had a well-paid job and a buzzing social life. But five years ago his world came crashing down after he developed crippling cluster headaches.

Also known as 'suicide' headaches, these are said to cause the most severe pain known to man (female sufferers say it's far worse than childbirth).

'One Thursday the pain hit me at work,' says Andrew, now 46. 'It felt as if there was a knife going through my eyeball. It was the worst pain I'd ever experienced.'

Andrew McNicholas  developed crippling cluster headaches five years ago

Since that first attack, he has three or four cluster headaches every day, lasting from between 40 minutes to three hours. He's tried 15 types of medications, and clinical trials, to treat them, but none worked and some caused severe side-effects including blood poisoning, heart palpitations and vomiting.

The attacks were so debilitating that Andrew had to quit his job as senior manager at an accountancy firm in March 2010.

No longer earning, he was forced to sell his home, and has rarely been able to go out. But a new handheld device has made his life 'liveable' again.

It targets the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the abdomen and relays messages to and from the heart, lungs and digestive system.

The nerve helps regulate key functions such as breathing and heart rate - but scientists increasingly believe it plays a role in a range of conditions, from depression to asthma and heart failure.

In September 2013, Andrew took part in a clinical trial at the Walton Centre NHS Trust, Liverpool, testing the use of the device, called GammaCore. It's applied to the neck and sends small electric pulses into the nerve.

They are also known as 'suicide' headaches, and female sufferers say it's far worse than childbirth

These pulses are thought to reduce levels of certain neurotransmitters - chemical messengers in the brain.One theory is that people who suffer from severe frequent headaches may produce too many neurotransmitters and, as a result, sensations that are not normally painful, such as seeing light, are misinterpreted by the brain, causing headache.

Users apply the battery-powered device to the neck for around two minutes when they feel a headache coming on.

'It always makes the pain less severe, and can stop my attacks within 25 minutes,' says Andrew, who lives in Manchester with his partner Kevin, 31.

'It's improved my pain by around 40 per cent and I feel living with this condition isn't hopeless any more, so I have fewer dark days.'

It's not a cure-all. When 19 people with cluster headaches took part in a trial at King's College Hospital, London, half found the device started to reduce symptoms after 11 minutes.

For this half it also helped them reduce their medication by half and reduced the frequency of their attacks from an average of 4½ to 2½ a day, says Peter Goadsby, professor of neurology at King's College London.

He is now using the GammaCore, which is applied to the neck and sends small electric pulses

The only side-effect was a slightly uncomfortable tugging feeling in the neck when it was used.

While acknowledging that more studies are needed to check its efficacy, Professor Goadsby says: 'If a proportion of people with a dreadful problem get some benefit, that's a good step forward.'

As well as cluster headaches, vagus nerve stimulation is being used to treat patients with epilepsy.

Here, it's usually given via a surgically-implanted electrode, but in recent years external devices have been used, too. It is thought to send messages to the brain which interfere with the chemicals that cause seizures.

'It doesn't always work brilliantly, but it's often the best treatment we have for epilepsy,' says Richard Selway, a consultant neurosurgeon at King's College Hospital.

Vagus nerve stimulation is being used in some cases of depression, too. This followed the discovery that epilepsy patients being treated with vagus nerve stimulation reported it improved their depression (even when the treatment did not help their epilepsy).

It is thought the pulses alter brain chemistry, which helps to improve mood.

Researchers are now looking at its benefits for other health problems, including obesity and heart failure.

Scientists have found that stimulating the vagus nerve slows the heart, allowing it to fill more with blood and then pump powerfully. The mild current given off by these stimulators don't affect organ function.

There is also ongoing research into its anti-inflammatory effects.

A Dutch study published in December found that patients with rheumatoid arthritis given vagus nerve stimulation experienced a significant reduction in pain after just six weeks.

A tiny disc was implanted in their chest, which was attached by a wire to the vagus nerve in the neck. The team said similar techniques could reverse other chronic conditions such as diabetes, as it may influence the levels of hormones produced by the body, including insulin.

Meanwhile, a team at Imperial College London is working on a microchip designed to stimulate the vagus nerve and suppress appetite, helping obese people lose weight.

The microchip, implanted through keyhole surgery, is placed around a nerve in the gut, which is in turn connected to the vagus nerve. The microchip senses high levels of hunger hormones such as ghrelin and sends electrical signals through the vagus nerve.

These supposedly trick the brain into thinking that you are full. As Professor Christofer Toumazou, director of the Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology at Imperial, explains: 'The chip only provides therapy if it diagnoses that you are producing too much hunger hormone.'

The technique may even be useful for Alzheimer's.

Simulating the vagus nerve may encourage the brain's locus coeruleus to release a form of adrenaline that boosts alertness and memory, says Mr Selway.

But is a handheld device or an implant better? Professor Goadsby believes the external devices are the way forward. 'They allow patients to test whether something works before having a device implanted, and if they can be produced cheaply and used at home, that saves the cost and time of using a surgeon.'

However, Mr Selway says one benefit of implanted devices is that patients don't need to remember to use it, which can be very helpful for the elderly.

'Vagus nerve stimulation is rarely a miracle cure, but it's a useful push in the right direction.'

GammaCore, which costs £250 for the device, is available privately. Treatment must be approved by a doctor.
