The head of New York tourism has defended its controversial decision to name Taylor Swift as the city's Global Welcome Ambassador.

Fred Dixon, President and CEO of NYC & Company, said that the Pennsylvanian-born, Nashville-raised pop star was a suitable choice given that it is a 'city of immigrants'.

The official marketing and tourism organisation for New York last week announced a year-long campaign starring the 24-year-old's song Welcome to New York.

'Starry-eyed optimism': NY Tourism has hit back at critics of Taylor Swift as Global Welcome Ambassador

The move was met with widespread criticism with many New Yorkers voicing their disappointment that somebody who has lived in the city less than a year would be chosen as its ambassador.

But Dixon, who is in the UK this week to attend London's World Travel Market, told TTG that traditional New Yorker's view of the city has 'been done'.

Swift was chosen because of her newcomer status, not in spite of it, Dixon said.

'New York is a city of immigrants, not many of us were born in New York – we’ve all followed our dreams there.'

Dixon revealed that Taylor's new role came about after he met her manager by chance, which led to an invitation to the singer's recently-purchased $20m (£12m) Tribeca apartment, where he first listened to her song dedicated to New York.

'[Taylor's] song Welcome To New York is written from the perspective of a newcomer, that starry-eyed optimism and overwhelming energy you feel when you first come to New York, and she wanted to share that.

'It’s like we wrote it for our own brand,' he said, adding that Swift's reach on social media and her 'authentic' engagement with her huge following is something that money can't buy.

The Shake It Off hitmaker is donating her time to the campaign for which she appears in a series of videos sharing her enthusiasm for the city. 

During an appearance on Good Morning America to mark the start of the campaign,  Swift said: 'When I love something, I'm very vocal about it, I'm vocal about it with my music.

'I just go around like, "Everybody! New York is amazing!" So I think they just picked up on that and gave me a title.'

In one of the campaign videos the singer explains some common slang words, such as 'stoop' (commonly known as a porch) and 'bodega', the 24-hour corner shops which sell 'almost anything'.

In another video, she assures visitors that in New York, 'people are very friendly and there's also a lot of heart here. And it's easy to get around. People will help you if you ask for help.'

'What makes New York City New York City is that it is unlike anywhere else in the world.

'It's almost like this city has its own heartbeat. You can find fashion that inspires you, art that inspires you, humanity that inspires you. 

'Everywhere you look. It's impossible not to fall in love or be affected by something in New York City.

'I think what brought me to New York is still a little bit of a mystery to me. 

'Every day I would wake up with this feeling, like I need to be in New York. It pulled me here like a magnet. 

'I was intimidated by the fact that it was bright and bold and loud, and now I know that I should run towards things like that. 

'I should run towards things that are absolutely overwhelmingly electric. 

'There's so much happening right in front of me, so many stories playing out that for my writing it definitely helped inspire an album that is by far the most proud of in my career.'

Following the announcement last week, the decision was attacked by New Yorkers, who felt the singer was not suitable for the role.

'I'm incensed! It's insulting,' said Twisted Sister singer Dee Snider, who was born in Queens.

He told the New York Daily News: 'She doesn't have any life experience here, or connection to the town.

'There's so many others — Jerry Seinfeld, for instance, if you want a big name,' Snider added. 

'But Taylor Swift is the pop culture queen, so she moves into town, and she's the ambassador.' 

The NYC Go Facebook page was flooded with negative responses.

'Taylor Swift has nothing to do with NYC, she is a bad representation. Get a real NY'er instead,' commented Ilana Vickers.

'Seems like a truly ridiculous ambassador,' wrote another poster, Kiersten Kehrer.

'We couldn't have asked for a better synergy between Taylor and NYC & Company to tell our story about what makes New York City, New York City,' NYC Go told MailOnline Travel last week.

'This is a campaign targeting visitors to New York City rather than locals.

'There's a separate campaign encouraging locals to explore their own city that celebrates the views of locals.'
