When the privacy storm erupted around Facebook and other sites, one thing became readily apparent: most users were simply not aware of what they had signed up for.

So, in a move to allay complaints, Facebook has created a new section that makes it easier for the average user to understand the site's terms and conditions.

Called Privacy Basics, the social network now breaks down all aspects of the site's terms of use for users in simple infographics - and also shows people how to change their privacy settings.

California-based Facebook has unveiled simplified privacy information on their site (screenshot shown), which uses infographics to explain how data is used by the social network. It also has step by step instructions for users to alter their settings

The site details what other Facebook users see about you when they use the site, as well as how they interact with you.

It also includes guides on how to change various settings, and control how you share content on Facebook, including how to change privacy settings.

The move has been welcomed by privacy campaigners, but they warn this should be the first step of many taken to improve the transparency of social networks.

- Location data for posts and photos that are shared on the site.

- The type of content you look at on Facebook, as well as the frequency and duration spent looking at it.

- Information and content about you from other users; including when they share a photo with you or send you a message.

- The location of the device, and the type of device you connect to Facebook from.

Emma Carr, director of privacy rights group Big Brother Watch said: 'It is certainly positive that steps are being taken to simplify privacy settings and to help educate users to have more control over their privacy.

'However, there is always more that could and should be done.

'With many internet companies' privacy policies and terms and conditions being longer than Shakespearean plays and requiring multiple law degrees to understand, users are undoubtedly still in the dark about how their information is accessed and manipulated.

'Until companies stop bamboozling their users with complicated and lengthy jargon, they simply cannot claim to be transparent or take the privacy of their users seriously.'

Facebook appear to be trying to do just that, with the California-based firm also confirming that a new version of their terms of service will come into effect on 1 January, with notifications being sent to Facebook users alerting them to the change and encouraging them to read the new agreement - which is accepted through continued use of the site and its official apps.

The new agreement has been made shorter, with parts relating to developers and advertisers both significantly cut down or moved to new pages in a move that Facebook hopes will make the agreements easier to digest.

In the blog post that announced the new Privacy Basics set-up, Facebook's chief privacy officer Erin Egan said that the aim was to better educate users on how they could take control of their data.

'Privacy Basics offers interactive guides to answer the most commonly asked questions about how you can control your information on Facebook,' she said.

'For example, you can learn about untagging, unfriending, and blocking, and how to choose an audience for your posts.'

With the new system in place, Facebook now also more clearly details the information about users it obtains.
