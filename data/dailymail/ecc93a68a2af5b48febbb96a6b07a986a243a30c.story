Income tax would have to rise by a crippling 9 pence in an independent Scotland to plug a £3billion financial black hole, a damning report has warned.

An ageing population and falling revenues from North Sea oil would mean big spending cuts and steep tax rises, the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has predicted.

There would be a fiscal gap in Scotland of 1.9 per cent of national income compared to 0.8 per cent of national income in the UK.

The tax rise of nine percentage points would be needed to fill the difference of income and expenditure, the IFS said.

Other options include raising VAT to 28 per cent and cutting eight per cent in public services spending.

Gemma Tetlow, IFS programme director and author of the report, said: ‘An independent Scotland would face even tougher choices than those faced by the UK over the longer term.’

Anti-separation campaigners seized on the IFS’ analysis, saying it left the pro-independence camp’s economic arguments ‘in tatters’.

Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney said that Scotland could have performed better if it had been independent since the 1970s

Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the report proved that independence would ‘condemn Scotland to a long period of non-stop austerity and spending cuts’.

‘I don’t think the break-up of Britain is inevitable,’ the Lib Dem leader said. 

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, a Scottish MP,  added: ‘Even on the most optimistic scenario, an independent Scotland would require cuts almost two and a half times as deep than if they stayed in the UK.’

Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, said: ‘This sober and impartial analysis by the IFS leaves the SNP’s economic case for independence in tatters. This is a risk that we don’t need to take.’

In the coming days, the SNP will suggest Scotland could have missed out on economic growth worth more than £900 per person as a result of Westminster’s handling of the economy.

The Scottish Government is preparing to publish a report on the economic powers that leaving the UK would provide and how it believes these could be used to boost growth and jobs.

Finance secretary John Swinney said: ‘The IFS themselves admit their projections in this report are “inherently uncertain” and could evolve differently if Scotland were independent rather than part of the UK.’

The IFS said: ‘Public spending per 
head is higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK while taxation of 
onshore activity raises a similar amount per head.

‘In
 2011-12 the difference between spending levels in Scotland and the rest
 of the UK was more than made up by higher revenues from the North Sea 
in Scotland if allocated on a geographic basis.

‘However,
 the outlook for public borrowing in future is less favourable for 
Scotland than for the UK as a whole because of demographic pressures and
 the likely decline of revenues from the North Sea over the longer 
term.’
