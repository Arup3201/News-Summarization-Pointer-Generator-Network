Two brothers have been charged with felony assault after a bathroom brawl at the new Levi's Stadium during Sunday's San Francisco 49ers game.

Santa Clara County prosecutors say 27-year-old Amador Rebollero - who also goes by the name Jose Ramos -  and 34-year-old Dario Rebollero appeared in court Wednesday, but they didn't enter pleas.

Prosecutors say one of the two victims, who are cousins, remains in critical condition and may be partially paralyzed. Their names haven't been released. 

Amador Rebollero could get 11 years in prison if convicted; his brother, 8 years. 

Santa Clara County prosecutors said in a release that 'The motive of the attack appears to be that the now possibly-paralyzed victim was in line at the men’s room behind Ramos and "nudged" him on the shoulder to point out an available urinal.'

Police said Monday they were reviewing video of a fight in a restroom at Levi's Stadium that left one man in serious condition

'These victims were beaten like animals,' Deputy District Attorney Deborah Hernandez said, according to CBS San Francisco. 'One of the victims has suffered severe injuries. He has some bleeding to the brain. He has had to have partial skull removal to relieve some of that pressure. He is currently suffering some paralysis.' 

Police said Monday they were reviewing the video of the fight inside the restroom at Levi's Stadium. 

In the video, which has been widely distributed on the Internet, the two assailants and two victims appear to be wearing 49ers gear. 

The footage shows the assailants raining punches down on two fellow fans, leaving one unconscious and the other lying on the floor desperately protecting his head. 

As punches are thrown other fans in the restroom can be heard urging those involved to calm down.

The person filming the footage turns the lens towards himself and says 'Wow' just before the clip ends. 

Alex Cartagena, who posted the video online after his brother-in-law Justin Sweeney recorded it, said the situation in the men's restroom was intense.

'One guy was impatient about another guy not taking the stall quickly enough,' he said. 'It happened really quickly. Next thing you know, the guy's lying on the floor.'

The suspects, Dario and Amador Rebollero, fled from the bathroom but were soon caught inside the stadium, said Santa Clara police spokesman Lt. Kurt Clarke. One victim was treated and released and the other was in serious condition.  

Spokesman Bob Lange said the team is deeply concerned about the victims.

'We were appalled to see the video of the attack on the victims,' he said, expressing gratitude to the police. 'Maintaining the safety of all stadium guests is our highest priority.'
