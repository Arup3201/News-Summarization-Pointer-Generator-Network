Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, appears during a hearing at the Sonoma County Superior Court in Santa Rosa, California, Thursday after allegedly grabbing a boy by the throat

A California mother accused of grabbing a 12-year-old boy by the throat for allegedly bullying her daughter did nothing wrong and may have been framed by the child, her attorney told reporters Thursday.

Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, of Santa Rosa, briefly appeared in Sonoma County Superior Court Thursday, but was not formally charged with a crime.

Deputy District Attorney Anne Masterson said the investigation is still ongoing and asked the judge to continue the case for the next two-three weeks, CBS San Francisco reported.

Garcia-Bratcher was arrested last Saturday on suspicion of inflicting injury to a child after she allegedly confronted a 12-year-old boy at Olivet Elementary School Friday afternoon.

Speaking to the press outside the courthouse Thursday, the mother's attorney, Ben Adams, called the 30-year-old woman a 'folk hero' for defending her daughter and suggested that her young accuser may have set her up, according to Santa Rosa Press Democrat. 

‘She is the mother of the year,’ Adams declared. ‘She did nothing wrong. Her daughter was being bullied, and she confronted the bully. What is wrong with that?’

The lawyer insisted yo the station KTVU that he is in possession of exculpatory evidence proving that the 12-year-old boy lied about his client grabbing him by the throat.

‘She is adamant she never laid a hand on him,’ he said.

Adams said that Garcia-Bratcher did go to her children’s school Friday and exchanged a few words with her 10-year-old daughter’s classmate, but she never laid a finger on him.

‘She said, “I don't want to have to tell on you. Stop being a brat,"’ Adams said, adding that the entire ordeal could have been prevented had school officials stepped up and done ‘their damn job.’

Asked about the red marks on the boy’s throat allegedly visible in photographs taken by a school official, Adams replied: ‘This boy is a bully, and I suspect he’s also a liar.’

Sonoma
 County Sheriff's Lt. Steve Brown previously suggested that Garcia-Bratcher may have targeted the wrong child because investigators have 
not found anything linking the 12-year-old boy to the bullying allegations.

On Thursday, Ben Adams addressed these claims, telling the gathered reporters: 'She did not get the wrong boy. The boy is lying if he says otherwise.'

Officials said at around 1.40pm on Friday, Garcia-Bratcher came to school to register one of her children when she ran into her son and asked him to point out the boy who has been calling her 10-year-old daughter a 'dirty Indian.'

The 30-year-old is alleged to have assaulted the boy in front of a number of children, the Sonoma County Sheriff's office added in a statement.

No adult saw the confrontation, and Garcia-Bratcher apparently had not checked in with the school office before coming on campus, authorities said.

The young witnesses later told a deputy the mother threatened the boy about bullying her daughter.

The boy then ran to a classroom, told a teacher and the two went to the office where school officials took pictures of the injuries.

The staff at the school took photos of red marks on the boy's neck as soon as they learned about the alleged assault, authorities said.

Garcia-Bratcher was arrested on a charge of felony child abuse. She was released from jail after posting a $30,000 bail.

The mother of six has since pulled her children from the elementary school, according to her attorney. She is due back in court June 19.
