British football fans will still be able to watch Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard when they head to America after Sky Sports won the exclusive rights to broadcast live Major League Soccer from the start of this season.

Sky have signed a four-year deal to show exclusively live games from the MLS from March when the season kicks off.

Former England internationals Gerrard and Lampard  join the league in July once they have finished playing in the Premier League.

Monday March 9

Gerrard will link up with former Liverpool team-mate Robbie Keane at defending MLS champions LA Galaxy and Lampard will team up with David Villa at New York City for their inaugural season in the league.

David Beckham, who played for LA Galaxy, welcomed the news, saying: ‘This is another important moment that shows the continued growth of MLS.

‘I have seen first-hand how popular soccer has become in America. Having fantastic partners such as Sky Sports on board will not only add to the coverage of the game, it will also broaden its appeal outside of the US.’

While Sky Sports pundit and former New York Red Bulls striker Thierry Henry said: ‘I will never forget my time playing in MLS - it gave me some great memories and I was proud to play a role in growing the game.

‘I saw the passion of the fans in the US. They have always had it for other sports but they also have it for football now and it’s going to be huge in years to come. Sky Sports is the best place for the game, to bring it closer to fans in the UK and build MLS even more.’

Frank Lampard will join new New York City in their debut season in MLS

Bradley Wright-Phillips was the top scorer in MLS last season for New York Red Bulls

Sky Sports managing director Barney Francis said: ‘Football in the US and Canada has enormous potential for growth and we can’t wait to bring this competition to our viewers for the first time. Thierry Henry has joined us, he created fantastic memories in MLS, and we look forward to seeing more of those great stories from across the Atlantic.’

Sky recently paid £4.2billion for the right to broadcast 126 live Premier League matches per season from 2016 on a three-year deal.

Kaka - Orlando City SC

The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass.

Frank Lampard – New York City FC

One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City.

Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy

The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane.

David Villa - New York City FC

Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season.

Bradley Wright Phillips - New York Red Bulls

Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.
