Ajax have entered negotiations to sign former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o, according to the Eredivisie club's football director Marc Overmars.

After spending a one-year loan spell at Stamford Bridge, the Cameroon international is now available as a free-agent with clubs including West Ham, QPR and Sunderland reportedly interested in signing the 33-year-old.

However, former Arsenal winger Overmars is confident that the prolific forward will be plying his trade in Holland this season - with Ajax also able to offer Champions League football.

'Samuel seemed very hungry to play for Ajax. He is fit and has a great drive to succeed once again,' Overmars told Voetbal International.

'We don't want to block the growing process of our talents like [Arkadiusz] Milik and [Richairo] Zivkovic, but if it is possible to sign a world class player like Eto'o, then why not? It will be fantastic.'

Eto'o scored 12 goals in all competitions for the Blues last season but courted controversy after manager Jose Mourinho was overheard implying that he was older than his stated age.

During an interview with French TV, the Blues boss made off-air comments about the Cameroon star, calling the forward an 'old man'.

Mourinho was heard saying: 'Eto’o is 32 years old, maybe 35, who knows?’

Eto'o branded Mourinho a 'fool' in the aftermath, but the Special One's comments still rankle with the African.

The striker has also received numerous lucrative offers from the Middle East but appears to want to continue playing at the highest level.
