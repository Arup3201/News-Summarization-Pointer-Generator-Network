They are the not-so-secret slimming saviour of the likes of Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey and Princess Beatrice.

So it was only a matter of time before figure-skimming brand Spanx launched a collection of slimming undergarments in honour of their A-list fans.

Spanx have launched a 'Star Power' range, which they promise will make mere mortals look and feel more like 'celebrities on the red carpet in picture-perfect gowns.'

Get their look! Kim Kardashian and Katy Perry love Spanx and now the figure-skimming label have unveiled a 'Star Power' range inspired by their A-list fans

Each product in the range, priced between £18 ($28) for a pair of pants and £53 ($82) for leggings, has a tongue-in-cheek name like 'Dress to Slimpress' or 'Award Thinners' - perhaps as a nod to super fan Adele who reportedly wore three pairs of the figure slimmers to the 2012 Grammys.

While most celebrities like to keep their Spanx well hidden, the new range - which is being sold on their website - is seemingly designed to be seen.

A-list look: The new range includes the Lady Luxe Open-Bust Mid-Thigh Body (£47/$52) and the Dress To Slimpress Suede Look Leggings (£53/$82)

Star style: There's also the Thin Vogue Tank Body (£40/$62) and the Lady Luxe Mid Thigh (£35/$54)

There's leather-look leggings, as well as faux-suede-panelled shapers, which aim to add a dazzling star touch.

The collection is available on the U.S. site and Maceys.com and will be landing on the UK site imminently.

The brand have also unveiled a bra to tackle the dreaded 'back fat bulge' and are set to launch a line of loungewear on QVC later this year.

Previously a red carpet secret, Spanx 
are now proudly worn by A-listers such as Kim and Kourtney Kardashian, Gwyneth 
Paltrow, Princess Beatrice, Jessica Alba and Beyonce.

Even tiny-waisted Rochelle from the Saturdays admitted to wearing them under her 
wedding dress last year.

Online: The range is being sold online and hopes to help women emulate their favourite A-listers

Little secret: Kim Kardashian and Kelly Osbourne have been spotted flashing their Spanx before

The more the merrier: Adele reportedly wore three pairs of Spanx under her Grammy 2012 dress

Over 36,000 body-shapers are manufactured each day

To date, more than 5.4 million Spanx Power Panties have been sold 
worldwide – when Oprah announced she’d 'given up panties' and only wore 
Spanx, more than 20,000 pairs were sold that day alone

Founded in 2000, Spanx is headquartered in Atlanta

During the eight-hour manufacturing process of Spanx hosiery products, more than 40 women touch each pair

After
 kickstarting a shapewear revolution, the company now makes more than 
200 figure-fixing products – from back-fat busting bras to bottom-boosting 
bodysuits
