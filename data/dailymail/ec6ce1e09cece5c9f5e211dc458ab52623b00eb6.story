President Barack Obama claimed Monday night during a Democratic Party fundraising dinner that the United States is 'stronger' than it was when he assumed office in January 2009.

His statement, though, appears to be at odds with key economic indicators, America's sliding reputation abroad, and the American public's estimation of the direction the country has taken under the Obama administration.

'In all sorts of ways,' Obama told Democratic partisans who paid between $15,000 to $32,400 to hear him speak, 'we are not just stronger than when we – where we were when I first came into office.'

He took off his golf glove: Obama took a break from his vacation to call foreign leaders with National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Monday before heading to a Democratic fundraiser where he claimed America is 'stronger' now than in January 2009

Distance: Americans and members of Congress don't seem to believe Obama's foreign policy inspires confidence

'It’s fair to say that America has the best cards when you look at other countries around the world.  There’s no other country you’d rather be than the United States.'

'Nobody can compete with us when we’re making the right decisions,' he said.

But Americans have become increasingly skeptical about the decisions emerging from the White House, both on domestic and foreign policy.

By a 20-point margin, they believe the nation is weaker under Obama's leadership, according to a Fox News poll released in June. Just 35 per cent told pollsters they agreed with what Obama said Monday night.

A whopping 68 per cent said the Obama administration is less competent than Bill Clinton's was.

Overall, a paltry 23 per cent of U.S. voters believe America is on the 'right track.' That number is from a Rasmussen poll released August 6.

Obama's job approval rating hit an all-time low of 40 per cent last week, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey. Just 36 per cent of Americans give a thumbs-up to his handling of foreign policy.

Obama 
appear to be fighting an uphill battle: Most polls show that his party 
will suffer a stinging defeat on Election Day in November, with the 
reliably center-left Washington Post predicting a strong likelihood that
 Republicans will control both houses of Congress for the last two years
 of his presidency.

'If the 
president thinks his record is going to help Democrats in the fall, he's 
whistling past the graveyard,' a Republican political consultant who has
 advised presidential candidates told MailOnline.

Key indicator: The ratio of America's debt to its gross domestic product has skyrocketed under Obama

'His
 coattails have shrunk to Lilliputian proportions, and it's well 
deserved,' he said. 'His entire agenda will be DOA after Republicans 
retake the Senate in November, and he has no one to blame but himself.'

The U.S. economy has slid into troubling territory in recent years. The percentage of working-age Americans who are part of the U.S. workforce has reached the lowest level since 1978, with one out of every three staying on the sidelines and not working.

And the federal government's debts have ballooned by $7 trillion since Obama took office, a sum larger than the accumulated U.S. debts between 1776 and the end of the Clinton administration.

The ratio of America's debt to its GDP has skyrocketed under Obama, according to the Federal Reserve.

Grove City College economics professor Tracy Miller wrote Monday in an op-ed for The Daily Caller that
 '[o]ver the first five years of Obama’s presidency, the U.S. economy 
grew more slowly than during any five-year period since just after the 
end of World War II, averaging less than 1.3 percent per year.'

Gallup's 'Economic Confidence Index,' a measure of Americans' confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy, reached -17 on Tuesday.

The
 poor showing, according to Gallup, is due to 'international and 
domestic challenges, including the rise of Islamic militants in Iraq, 
intense fighting between the Israelis and Palestinians, increasing 
U.S.-Russia tensions, a wave of illegal immigrants from Central America,
 and stock market volatility.'

'Whistling past the graveyard': Obama may be kidding himself when he claims America is on the rise, according to one political consultant

The immigrant deluge has been particularly harmful for Obama's standing among Americans. Republicans argue that his 2012 policy relaxing deportations of so-called 'DREAMers' – people brought to the U.S. illegally as children – has encouraged tens of thousands of Central Americans to send their children northward alone.

The border battles and Obama's
 policies overseas have monopolized news coverage of the White House for
 weeks as he has struggled to fend off criticisms of his handling of 
crises in Ukraine, Syria and Iraq.

Even Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state, has been piling on.

She took the president to task last week, telling The Atlantic
 that his 'failure' to arm Syrian rebels opposing dictator Bashar 
al-Assad ultimately led to the rapid rise of ISIS, a militant Islamist 
terror group that is making steady military advances across Syria and 
Iraq while it slaughters religious and ethnic minority groups.

'The
 failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who 
were the originators of the protests against Assad – there were 
Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle – 
the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now 
filled,' Clinton said.

Obama
 has heard that criticism before, and called it 'horses**t' during a 
meeting with members of Congress last month, according to a lawmaker who
 spoke to The Daily Beast.
