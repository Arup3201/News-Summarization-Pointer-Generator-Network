The 31st Breeders’ Cup is upon us, and Sportsmail takes you through the runners and riders.

27 European runners, including six in tomorrow’s $2million Mile headed by Richard Hannon’s Queen Anne Stakes winner Toronado. Also Dermot Weld’s Jersey Stakes winner Mustajeeb and Anodin, representing Freddie Head who landed the race three times as a trainer with Goldikova (2008-2010) and twice as a jockey with Miesque (1978-9).

5 Sir Michael Stoute is going for a fifth win in the Turf with Telescope (Ryan Moore). He will be supported by part owner Sir Alex Ferguson.

The football link is extended by Tom Dascombe-trained, Michael Owen-owned Brown Panther. But the favourite is Arc runner-up Flintshire, trained in France by Andre Fabre who has won the race twice with In The Wings (1990) and Shirocco (2005).

There will be 13 races over two days worth $24.5m (£15.3m) at Southern California track Santa Anita.

The most valuable race is the finale $5m (£3.12m) Classic run on Dirt to be contested by Jamie Osborne’s Toast Of New York.

5 wins by European runners last year.

Former Nicky Henderson stable lad Conor Murphy, who embarked on a US training career after winning £1m with a Cheltenham Festival bet in 2013, finished fifth with ex-James Fanshawe-trained Dimension in last year’s Turf Sprint. He will try again this year.

Stoute-trained Dank hasn’t run since Royal Ascot but Ryan Moore’s mount will defend her crown in tomorrow’s Filly & Mare Turf, alongside Ralph Beckett’s Secret Gesture, Charlie Hills’s Just The Judge, and Willie McCreery’s Fiesolana.

For the US, Main Sequence failed to win a race in Britain after his second in the 2012 Derby. But he leads home defence in the Turf after winning all three races since moving to Graham Motion’s stable. Royal Ascot winners Hootenanny and Nay Nay Never plus runner-up Sunset Glow represent trainer Wesley Ward in the Juvenile Turf, Turf Sprint and Juvenile Fillies Turf respectively.
