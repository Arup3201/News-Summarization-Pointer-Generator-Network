Chinese police  rescued dozens of newborn children from an illegal 'baby factory' after busting a human trafficking gang who intended to sell them for adoption.

Police raided the 'factory' in in eastern China's Shandong province and found 37 children living in squalid conditions being fed noodles and leftovers.

Several of the young children were found to be suffering from AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases, local police said.

Shandong police arrested 103 members of the child trafficking gang who are now accused of paying women to fall pregnant and give birth in the 'factory'. 

A police spokesman said the mothers-to-be would arrive en masse and give birth in the factory, leaving their newborn babies in exchange for money.

'Thirty-seven newborn babies were found and none of them were healthy, with at least seven having a sexually-transmitted disease or AIDS,' the Shandong Police's spokesman said.

'The conditions in the factory were unhygienic and totally unsuitable for unsupervised childbirth and the babies were taken from the mothers as soon as they were born.

'We also found evidence that they were being fed takeaway noodles and leftovers.'

The director of the Ministry of Public Security and Anti-trafficking, Chen Shigu, explained that 'baby factories' are a 'relatively new form of child trafficking'.

He said: 'In some cases the gang targeted women who are already pregnant offers them large amounts of money to hand the baby over. 

'In other cases they pay the women to get pregnant.

'This is a relatively new form of child trafficking and differs from the traditional form which usually sees the children stolen.'

He added that women involved in the selling of newborns could get anything between £5,000 and £9,000 for boys, while girls brought a little less.

If found guilty of selling more than three children, the human traffickers face a possible death sentence.
