A man who went on the run after a bank mistakenly deposited millions of dollars into his account has pleaded guilty to multiple charges of theft.

Hui 'Leo' Gao was dubbed the 'accidental millionaire' after Westpac bank mistakenly gave the petrol station owner a credit line of 10 million New Zealand dollars ($7.7 million) in 2009, which was 100 times his approved limit.

Gao and partner Kara Hurring then transferred millions of dollars into other accounts and left for China.

Hong Kong police arrested the 31-year-old Gao last year and New Zealand authorities extradited him.

Ms Hurring returned voluntarily after having a baby and was last month found guilty of theft, attempted fraud and money laundering.

Gao today pleaded guilty
to seven counts of theft.

In April 2009 Gao was living with his 
girlfriend Kara Hurring in the tourist town of Rotorua, known for its 
geysers and boiling mud pools.

They ran a gas station that Gao jointly 
owned with his mother. Gao successfully applied for a temporary credit 
line from Westpac, which the bank inadvertently multiplied by 100.

When the cash-strapped gas station owner went online to check his bank account, he suddenly yelled out to his girlfriend that he was rich: 'I've got a million dollars.'

After discovering the mistake, Gao didn't waste any time.

'As soon as he realised the error made by Westpac, the accused set about planning how he could transfer funds now available to him offshore,' court documents state.

That set in motion a complicated series of transactions.

Money went in and out of various accounts and companies, with some ending up in Chinese bank accounts, including accounts owned by Gao's mother.

Other money ended up in various player accounts at a casino in Macau.

The players included Gao's father and Hurring.

By late April, Gao had left for Hong Kong and so had his parents.

Hurring, who'd filed an urgent application for a replacement passport, followed soon after. The couple then vanished into mainland China as an international manhunt got under way.

Hurring, 33, returned voluntarily to New Zealand early last year after having a child.

In September, Gao was arrested by Hong Kong police as he tried to cross into the city from mainland China. Authorities extradited Gao to New Zealand three months after that.

A jury convicted a tearful Hurring last month of theft, attempted fraud and money laundering.

Both Gao and Hurring are scheduled to be sentenced in August. Gao's parents have not been charged.

A summary of facts presented to the 
Rotorua District Court by prosecutors, which hasn't been challenged by 
defence lawyers, indicates Gao stole NZ$6.8 million before the bank 
realised its mistake.

The bank managed to get back about 
NZ$3 million by reversing some of the transfers but has never been able 
to recover the final NZ$3.8 million.

Gao has maintained his silence to police about the missing money and everything else to do with the case.

Gao's lawyer Ron Mansfield declined to comment today.

Prosecutor Fletcher Pilditch said it was an unusual crime and one unlikely to be repeated any time soon due to better banking safeguards.

'I think everyone in the banking industry has learned a few lessons from this.' he said.
