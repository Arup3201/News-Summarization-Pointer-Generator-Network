A plane crashed into a man on a lawnmower at a North Carolina airport, severing his hand.

Edward Sisson, 84, was flying a 1971 Citabria 7ECA when he hit the landing strip at the west end of Taylorsville Airport, according to the Hickory Record.

John Rufty, 74, was mowing the airport's grass when the plane hit him as it moved toward the end of the landing strip, the paper says, and flipped - leaving Rufty and the mower underneath the right wing.

No charges: there are no charges as of this time relating to the plane crash that severed John Rufty's hand

Flipped: After the plane hit Rufty mowing the airport grass, it flipped and left Rufty and the mower underneath a wing

Rufty, who maintains the field and has a hangar on the property, was taken to a helicopter and later flown to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, the paper says. He was placed on blood thinners and was transported along with his severed hand.

Taylorsville Airport does not have flight controllers.

Russell Greene, emergency management coordinator for Alexander County, explained how planes normally operate to the Record.

'This is a simple grass strip, small planes only,' Greene said. 'Typically, pilots circle the field, make sure the field is clear, and then come in and land.'

Sisson was uninjured, according to the Record, and sat in a SUV near the crash. He was reportedly flying in from Tennesee to visit family in the area. An investigation is set to be handled by the National Transportation and Safety Board.

State Highway Patrol Sergeant Brian Owenby told the New York Daily News that Sisson seemed to be competent.

'He was 84, but he didn't look like it or act it,' he said.

Owenby said that there are no charges at this time.
