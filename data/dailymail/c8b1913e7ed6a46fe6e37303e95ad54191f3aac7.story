If you fall into the national 
average - a curvy size 16 - and want your fashion with a capital 'F', 
it's likely that you will find it difficult to buy stylish items in your
 size.

But with sales of plus size clothing topping £4.2 billion in 2012, up 40 per cent since 2007, the plus size clothing industry has never been in bigger demand.

And one hosiery brand hoping to cash in is Cette who aim to revolutionise tights for plus size ladies everywhere.

For the larger lady: Cette Madison Plus Size Tights, which cater for up to size 34, use a first of its kind Lycra Xceptionelle- a Lycra technology so new that it's still awaiting its Patent

Cette maintain that the 47 per cent of women in the UK who measure in at size 14 and above are not being catered for.

So they have created Cette Madison Plus Size Tights, which cater for up to size 34 and use a first of its kind Lycra 
Xceptionelle - a Lycra technology so new that it's still awaiting its patent.

'Gone are the days 
of pinching waistbands and unflattering designs,' say Cette.

'Using the unique Lycra 
Xceptionelle yarn and smart design features, we've managed to 
transform the humble plus size tights and elevated them into hosiery 
heroes.'

Revolutionary: The 20 denier tights use a brand new technology that aims to be comfortable and reduce chafing

The 20 denier tights have been tailor made to offer the correct compression to the right 
part of the leg with a special reinforced inner thigh area made in a 
high denier yarn.

The new design aims to eliminate painful chafing that many women on the go suffer with.

Claire O’Neill, a spokesperson for INVISTA who make the innovative Lycra fibre being used for the first time in this product, said: Today there are millions of “plus size” women worldwide, and these consumers are having a hard time finding hosiery garments that are both elegant and comfortable.

'INVISTA designed Lycra Xceptionelle hosiery thinking about this consumer and developed its patent pending invention through a combination of an engineered garment construction and the use of Lycra fibre technology that accommodates for the differing body shapes of larger women.

In demand: MyTights.com who sell the new hosiery saw a 41 per cent increase in like-for-like for Plus Size products and say the new Cette tights pre-orders are sky high

'It is great to see that the hosiery industry is adopting this invention: now plus size women will be able to fit elegant hosiery which offers comfort in wearing by helping to prevent dig-in at the waist or thigh.

'We are excited with this launch!'

And it seems that the plus size world are also excited with 83 per cent finding the garment very different to any other existing product in the marketplace.

Rivkie Baum, Editor-in-Chief of plus size magazine SLinK said: 'These tights sound like a plus size girls dream.

'Tight manufacturers like a lot of the fashion industry rarely cater adequately for this market but tights that actually minimise chafing between the thighs which can be really painful and deter women from walking that bit extra are a fantastic idea and are providing the comfort and style that plus size girls want just as much as their straight size counterparts.'

Support: Both SLiNK and Curvaceous Inc plus size magazines are firm fans of the brand

MyTights.com who sell the new hosiery saw a 41 per cent increase in like-for-like for plus size products and say the new Cette tights pre-orders are sky high.

Emma Burgess, Creative Director of Curvaceous Inc, a new plus size magazine, said: 'Cette Madison understand the importance of providing top class fashions for plus size women, not only is it imperative to style larger women well, but comfort is also key, if you feel good that will reflect in your appearance!

'Here at Curvaceous Inc we believe Cette Madison are not only fashionably catering for a regularly neglected audience but are also embracing all the elements that make a fantastic hosiery range.

'We love that these tights are seamless and finished with a beautiful matt touch and that there is a hosiery brand ready to embrace our beautiful curves.'
