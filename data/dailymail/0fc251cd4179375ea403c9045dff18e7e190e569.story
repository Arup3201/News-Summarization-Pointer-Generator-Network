The original Ronaldo has taken to playing poker, which might explain why he is willing to take a punt on such a weak hand.

With the waiting nearly over, one of the World Cup greats is weighing up the contenders.

He mentions Brazil. Then he mentions pressure and Neymar. One of the most fascinating sub-plots of a magnificently open competition will be how that 22-year-old deals with the demands of his country.

As Ronaldo knows, Brazilian strikers don’t carry light loads.

Are you sure? Brazil's Ronaldo believes that England have a chance of winning the 2014 World Cup

Gotcha! Ronaldo was tricked by his former World Cup teammate Bebeto (R)

Then Ronaldo mentions England. In this summer of muted hopes, it may be the first prediction from any major footballing figure outside Roy Hodgson’s squad. Ronaldo wants to throw some chips down.

‘You never know in football,’ he says. ‘Over the years the sport has shown us great examples of this so you cannot say a team are not potential winners. England should definitely be considered, they can surprise us. Uruguay are very good but Brazil, Germany, Argentina and Spain are the strongest.’

For Ronaldo, it’s nice to talk about football. He is the ambassador who is not a politician. Not in the sense that Romario is, his immediate predecessor in Brazil’s list of great strikers.

The two men don’t get on  terribly well these days. Their spats over the past year of organisational chaos have become something of a feature.

Hope: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored in a shock friendly 2-2 against Brazil at the Maracana, June 2013

While Romario, the star of Brazil’s 1994 win, has turned to politics and been one of the loudest critics of the country’s prioritisation of football over social policies, Ronaldo, the inspiration of their 2002 triumph, has been one of the event’s major cheerleaders.

While Romario has focused on the serious issues, Ronaldo has largely wanted to talk football and the glorious unpredictability of this World Cup, one where Brazil may be challenged by the little man called Lionel who lives next door.

The potential exists for a great event and it also allows room for an enormous capitulation, such is the expectation in Brazil for a sixth World Cup win.

Great expectations: The pressure will be on Brazil's next brightest star Neymar at the World Cup

It is a pressure that could become relevant, according to a man who won one final, was an unused substitute in another and was central to the mother of all pre-final scandals in 1998.

‘Brazil has a great chance,’ Ronaldo said. ‘We played in the Confederations Cup and demonstrated what we can do (with a 3-0 demolition of Spain in the final). We have a solid defence, a midfield that battles very hard and great goalscorers.

‘We are at home and have an exceptional player in Neymar. The pressure will be greater than normal but the fans’ support will spur the team on.

German engineering: Miroslav Klose could beat Ronaldo's goal scoring record of 15 goals

There is also the small matter of Ronaldo’s record of 15 World Cup goals which could be taken by Miroslav Klose, that most un-Brazilian of German strikers.

‘I am very proud of that record but records are there to be broken,’ Ronaldo added. ‘It would be nice to keep it for a while longer but I am cheering for someone to break the record. It will be good for the sport.’

So would an England triumph, but that seems an altogether riskier bet.

One of the most prestigious World Cup records will be there for the taking when Miroslav Klose resumes his brilliant relationship with the event.

In the past three editions he has amassed 14 goals, and will overtake Ronaldo’s record if he nets twice in Brazil.

He is the man who has often come close, but not gone close enough. He is the Lazio striker who is not a star. His nickname is Miro and his game is no more flamboyant. His notable World Cup record is that he is the only man to score five headers in a single competition. Nice, but not nice enough for many billboards. Yet this is a numbers game. And in a game of international numbers Klose is a superstar. Klose has been steady for his clubs, but 206 goals in 524 games is not the stuff of legends.

However, on the international stage he is a machine. Aged 35, he is level with Gerd Muller on 68 goals for Germany.

Where they differ is that when Klose scores for Germany they never lose. That might bode well this summer for Germany and the modest man who does so much to make them shine.
