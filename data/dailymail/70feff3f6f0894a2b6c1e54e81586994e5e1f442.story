A Penn State student is gaining an Internet reputation as a 'squirrel whisperer' thanks to her amazing ability to get a wild campus squirrel named Sneezy to pose in hilarious photos.

Mary Krupa routinely dresses up the Eastern gray squirrel in hats and with props like pencils or tea cups to create scenes both adorable and little otherworldy--all for just peanuts.

Sneezy happily strikes poses for the crunchy treats and her tameness, along with Krupa's uncanny persuasion skills, have turned the costumed critter into a kind of unofficial internet school mascot.

Wild America: A Penn State student has turned a campus squirrel into an internet celebrity by taking pictures of it in various cute poses, with props and in tiny paper hats

Chilling: Mary Krupa, a Penn State junior, has dubbed the squirrel Sneezy for its frequent sneezes

Costs just peanuts: Sneezy is a wild Eastern gray squirrel that was born on the Penn State campus in State College, Pennsylvania and happens to be willing to pose for photos 

Krupa, whose Facebook photos of Sneezy have gained international attention, even says a German magazine who interviewed her actually thought the squirrel was Penn State's mascot.

'They got a little confused,' she told WJAC.

Make no mistake, though--if popularity along decided, Sneezy would be a shoo-in. The Facebook page Krupa runs for the squirrel actually has more 'Likes' than the school's actual masco, Nittany Lion.

Krupa's method is simple. She offers Sneezy a peanut and, while the squirrel nibbles, she puts a hat on her.

To get Sneezy to hold props, like the tea cup she used in an English tea party-themed shoot, she simply smears a little peanut butter on whatever she wants the squirrel to hold.

Fighting form: Sneezy is always up to the task of taking photos for Krupa, so long as the Penn State junior offers her peanuts during the shoot

Squirrel full of multitudes: Whether its a motorcycle or teacup, Sneezy is willing to hold it--so long as it's smeared with peanut buitter

Buzz: Krupa created a Facebook page for Sneezy and the response has been huge. Thanks to the hilarious photos, Sneezy the Penn State Squirrel has received 20,000 likes

 

As easy as it sounds, Krupa makes clear that Sneezy is in control.

'I can never force her to do anything she doesn't want to do,' she told NPR. 'I mean, if she gets tired she'll just go up the tree.'

Krupa discovered the friendliness of the campus squirrels when she was a freshman. She's now a junior and has befriended multiple squirrels.

However, Sneezy--who got her name from her frequent adorable sneezes--likes Krupa the most, and the feeling is mutual.

While other squirrels have let Krupa put hats on them, Sneezy is always the most willing.

'As long as she has food she is completely relaxed and really comfortable with people. She is just the sweetest, laid back squirrel ever,' Krupa said.  

Like magic: While other squirrels have relented to Krupa putting hats on them, only Sneezy is eager to come and play dress-up

All American: Sneezy has even outstripped actual Penn State mascot the Nittany Lion in number of Facebook likes

High brow: A German magazine even mistakenly wrote that Sneezy the Squirrel is, in fact, the mascot of the school of some 35,000 undergrads
