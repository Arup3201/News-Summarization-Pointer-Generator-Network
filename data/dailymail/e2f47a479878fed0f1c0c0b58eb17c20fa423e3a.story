Britain is a nation of shop assistants, cleaners and restaurant staff despite increasingly better educated and skilled professionals, according to a new report.

The top five largest single occupational groupings include 1.1 million sales and retail assistants, 600,000 cleaners and domestics and 450,000 kitchen and catering assistants, said the Jobs Economist consultancy.

The 10 occupations which have expanded most over the past three years are taxation experts (up 88 per cent to 34,000), advertising accounts managers and creative directors (up 75 per cent to 33,000), window cleaners (up 73 per cent, to 47,000), planning process and production technicians (up 72 per cent to 44,000), paramedics (up 62 per cent to 22,000), psychologists (up 59 per cent to 39,000), collector salespersons and credit agents (up 59 per cent to 24,000), process and production engineers (up 58 per cent to 66,000), town planning officers (up 55 per cent to 24,000) and bakers and flour confectioners (up 54 per cent to 40,000).

All these increases are much greater than the average increase in total UK employment of around 5 per cent in the corresponding period, said the report.

The 10 occupations which have contracted most over the past three years are debt, rent and other cash collectors (down 52 per cent to 20,000), TV, video and audio engineers (down 46 per cent to 6,000), insurance underwriters (down 45 per cent to 20,000), social and humanities scientists (down 42 per cent to 10,000), waste disposal and environmental services managers (down 40 per cent to 13,000), floorers and wall tilers (down 39 per cent to 25,000), managers and proprietors in forestry and fishing (down 34 per cent to 8,000), quarry workers and related operatives (down 38 per cent to 9,000), rail construction and maintenance officers (down 32 per cent to 9,000) and sheet metal workers (down 33 per cent to 13,000).

Tuning out: TV, video and audio engineers have dropped 6 per cent to 6,000. File picture

Cleaning up: The number of window cleaners has risen by 73 per cent, to 47,000

Dr John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist, said: 'Our complex and fluid occupational structure explains why there are so many conflicting views on how the British way of work is changing.

'From one perspective it's clear that so-called 'knowledge work' is firmly on the rise, requiring a high level of professional and technical skill and offering decent pay prospects.

'Yet equally apparent is a substantial bedrock of low skill, low wage service work which accounts for the UK's relatively high incidence of low pay, with around one in five (five million) employees earning less than the commonly used low pay threshold for developed economies.

'While with considerable justification we like to portray ourselves as a nation of increasingly better educated and skilled professionals, we could also reasonably be described as a nation of shop assistants, cleaners and restaurant or cafe washer-uppers.'
