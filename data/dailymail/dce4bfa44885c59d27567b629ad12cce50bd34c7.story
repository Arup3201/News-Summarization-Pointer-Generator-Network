Al-Shabaab - the extremist group behind the Kenyan mall massacre - is believed to have funded its terrorist attack by poaching endangered species in the country's national parks.

Authorities have confirmed a probe has been launched into claims that the group, linked with al Qaeda, are behind the poaching of rhinos and elephants, as an animal 'head count' is launched in Kenya and Tanzania at the Amboseli National Park in Kajiado County.

Hillary Clinton recently unveiled an $80 
million plan to tackle elephant poaching in Africa.

She warned that money from the wildlife crime could be helping to fund terrorist groups  - including the al-Shabaab group 
that launched the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya last month, a theory which is backed by elephant conservation groups.

Elephants graze in a marsh at Amboseli National Park, Nairobi. Kenyan and Tanzanian governments have started a joint aerial count of elephants and other large mammals in the shared ecosystem of the Amboseli-West Kilimanjaro and Natron- Magadi landscape

The census comes as authorities launch a probe into claims that Al Shabaab, linked with al-Qaeda, are behind the poaching of rhinos and elephants

The one-week census exercise, will cost 104,000 US dollars, is a collaboration between the two countries and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI) and the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) among others

It has been reported that local communities are being enlisted to poach the elephants and other large animals on behalf of terrorist organisations

The Elephant Action League (EAL),  launched a two year undercover investigation of elephant poaching in Kenya in 2011.

Andrea Crosta, who lead the investigation, said many poachers he spoke to said they were increasingly selling to al-Shabaab, the New Scientist reports.

The ivory is then sold on to markets in Asia, at hugely inflated prices.

He said: 'Part
 of al-Shabaab's funding has been, and is still, from ivory.'

He added that according to sources in the militant group, 3 tonnes of ivory were passing through Somalian ports each month.

It is believed this could be earning the group up to $600,000 (£375,000) a month.

In the past month, armed poachers are said to have slaughtered five rhinos in the Oserian sanctuary and escaped with the horns.

The rise in poaching is concerning authorities as the killers are targeting endangered species.

William Kiprono, director of Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), said it was now investigating the claims, and warned local communities not to be 'used by foreigners' for poaching.

Standard Digital News reports: 'The problem of poaching does not only involve foreigners but is done in four stages – from local level, financiers, exporters up to consumers – and our people are used to kill the wild animals.

An elephant and its calf are captured as they graze at Amboseli National Park. It is the practice of Kenyan and Tanzania wildlife authorities to conduct both a wet and a dry aerial census every three years

The census will also count other large animals, including wilderbeest and rhino

Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), said the week-long drive will establish the status of wildlife within the cross-border landscape which includes the elephant, wildebeest, zebra and other large mammals

William Kiprono, director of Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), speaking at the launch of the census, said it was now investigating the claims, and warned local communities not to be 'used' for poaching

'I urge them to stop this habit as it is primitive and aimed at destroying nature, which cannot then be enjoyed by the next generation.'

It comes as an animal 'head count' is launched in Kenya and Tanzania at the Amboseli National Park in Kajiado County.

The census will be carried out this week, and will cost 104,000 US dollars. It is a collaboration between the two countries and the Kenya  Wildlife Service (KWS), Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI) and the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF).

Kenyan and Tanzanian governments started on October 7 a joint aerial count of elephants and other large mammals in the shared ecosystem of the Amboseli-West Kilimanjaro and Natron- Magadi landscape.

Rhino horn is just one part of a trade worth an estimated 19 billion US dollars (£12 billion), making it the fourth biggest global illegal trade after narcotics, counterfeiting and human trafficking.

Elephants are captured on film by census teams. The Centre for Pastoralists Development (Cepad) said it was concerned over a rise in poaching in ranches in the last few months

Al-Shabab, which is part of al-Qaeda, has said it carried out the attack on the Westgate shopping mall, in which at least 67 people were killed

Among the reasons for the trade is demand for medicines, consumer goods and the desire to possess exotic pets, hunting trophies and rare plants and animals.

Illegal wildlife trade thrives in places with widespread corruption, weak law enforcement and where rangers, police officers and customs officials are not sufficiently trained or resourced with new tools such as DNA tracing technology.

The Centre for Pastoralists Development (Cepad) said it was concerned over the rise in poaching in ranches in the last few months.

Al-Shabab, which is part of al-Qaeda, has said it carried out the attack on the Westgate shopping mall, in which at least 67 people were killed.

The count comes after a similar wet count done earlier in April this year. It is the practice of Kenyan and Tanzania wildlife authorities to conduct both a wet and a dry aerial census every three years in the Amboseli West Kilimanjaro and Magadi Natron cross border landscape.

This collaboration started in 2010 and this census is the fourth.
