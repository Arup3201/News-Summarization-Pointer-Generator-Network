England boss Roy Hodgson has handed West Brom striker Saido Berahino his first senior call-up ahead of November's games against Slovenia and Scotland. 

The Three Lions face a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on November 15, three days before crossing the border for a friendly with Gordon Strachan's side.

Berahino, who has starred for Gareth Southgate's Under 21 side, has caught the eye of Hodgson after netting seven goals in 10 Premier League appearances for the Baggies this season.

Asked about his decision to give the 21-year-old a chance at his press conference on Thursday, Hodgson said: 'The reasons are quite obvious - he's done so well, not only for West Bromwich Albion but also for the Under 21 team. He's really been in good form.

'The last get-together he was obviously in our minds but we didn't choose him because of the importance of the two Under 21 qualifiers against Croatia.

'But this time they only have a friendly match, so there's no reason to pass over his credentials yet again.'

Hodgson has also opted to hand Theo Walcott an immediate recall to his squad, despite the Arsenal winger having only played 11 minutes of Premier League football since his return from a serious knee injury.

Another winger who has played his way back into Hodgson's plans is Stewart Downing, who last won a cap back in May 2012. The West Ham star has been in fine form this season, helping Sam Allardyce's side climb to fifth in the table with two goals and five assists.

'He's had a tremendous resurgence of form,' Hodgson said. 'We considered him for last squad. We seriously considered whether we should take him the last time.'

The other surprise inclusion is Michael Carrick, with the Manchester United midfielder having only just returned from a long-term injury after missing out on a place in Hodgson's World Cup squad.

England's midfield options also include Everton's Ross Barkley, Arsenal duo Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Liverpool trio Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Adam Lallana, Manchester City utility man James Milner and Tottenham winger Andros Townsend.

Liverpool's Glen Johnson has failed to earn a recall, with Nathaniel Clyne, Calum Chambers and Chris Smalling all capable of playing at right back.

Everton duo Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka, Chelsea's Gary Cahill, Manchester United's Luke Shaw and Arsenal left back Kieran Gibbs complete Hodgson's defensive options. 

Hodgson has chosen to call up Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge as the 25-year-old continues to recover from a troublesome calf problem which followed a thigh injury picked up on international duty in September.

United striker Wayne Rooney, Arsenal's Danny Welbeck and Liverpool forward Rickie Lambert will compete with Berahino for a place up-front.
