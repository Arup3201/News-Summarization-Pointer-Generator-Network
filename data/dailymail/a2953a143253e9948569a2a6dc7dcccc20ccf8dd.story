Serial prankster Stuart Littlefield admits he got what he deserved.

The Kansas City detective arrived at work on August 5 to find his police car covered in 4,000 colorful Post-it notes - a gift for this 50th birthday.

'Yup, they got me good this time. This 
was supposed to be a low-key birthday,' Littlefield told Fox 4.

'When you're 50, you don't want 
anyone to know about it. That kind of blew up in my face.'

In 20 
years of working with the Kansas Police Department, Littlefield admits he's played his fair-share of pranks on unsuspecting colleagues.

He said it was fitting they got payback on his birthday. The entire frame of his Ford Taurus was covered in blue, green, yellow and pink sticky notes.

'I have to say that I deserve this,' Littlefield laughed.

'I have always been the guy who stirs the pot within the unit. I'm the first to cause trouble.'

He said he doesn't know who was behind the prank, but promised to get them back.
