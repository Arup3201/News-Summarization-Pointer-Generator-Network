A Utah jury on Thursday found wife-killing Mormon doctor Martin MacNeill guilty of sexually assaulting his daughter.

It took just two hours for the jury of five women and three men to convict the 58-year-old of fondling his daughter not long after he overmedicated his wife so she'd drown in the bathtub.

MacNeill is still awaiting sentencing for the coldblooded 2007 murder. In addition to that possible sentence, he could now receive 15 years on the sex abuse charge.

The daughter MacNeill assaulted was 30-year-old Alexis Somers, who identified herself to reporters as the victim as the jury first left the courtroom to deliberate.

'At the end of the day and regardless of the outcome, I will have done everything in my power to protect my family,' she told KSTU.

MacNeill says she came forward with revelations her father assaulted her after she fell asleep on her mother's bed while cleaning it out following her death because she feared for her siblings.

Following her mother's death, MacNeill's younger sisters still lived at the family home with their father.

'I was feeling panic, horror, fear that  my sisters were not safe,' she told the jury. 'They were at the home of someone who just murdered my mom.'

In September 2007, then-24-year-old Alexis Somers filed a police report claiming that her father had abused her on two occasions in the three months after her mother's death.

According to the charging documents, in May 2007, Alexis was asleep in her parents' bed when she was awakened by her father fondling her and kissing her hand. He was supposed to be sleeping on the couch.

Alexis demanded to know what her father was doing, to which he allegedly replied, 'I'm sorry, I thought you were your mother.'

A similar incident reportedly took place two months later while the family were vacationing in California.

In a recorded phone conversation, MacNeill allegedly told Alexis that he 'was asleep' when he assaulted her.

When confronted with allegations of sex abuse while being questioned by police, MacNeill stated that a person cannot be held accountable for his actions while he's asleep, according to court documents.

MacNeill sat silent and motionless throughout the two-day proceedings.

In December, MacNeill left a suicide note and slit a major leg artery with a disposable razor, court documents show. Utah County jail officials intervened to save his life.

Alexis Somers and her sisters had spent years dogging the authorities to open a murder investigation, and were instrumental in bringing their father to account for their mother's slaying. 

The young women claimed that the seemingly respectable doctor and a former bishop in his local congregation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was, in fact, a monster and philandered who led a double life and killed his wife so he could be with his mistress, Gypsy Willis.

It wasn't until MacNeill's release in July 2012 from a federal prison in Texas on charges of fraud that Utah prosecutors moved to file charges of murder and obstruction of justice.

During the trial, MacNeill's daughter Sabrina testified that Willis, who was hired as their nanny, spent every night in the doctor's bedroom after their mother's death.

Not looking good: MacNeill recently tried to kill himself in prison by slicing an artery in his left with a disposable razor. He is still awaiting sentencing for killing his wife, for which he could get up to life in prison. He could get 15 years on the sex abuse charge
