Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho claimed the emotions almost rendered him speechless after helping his side secure the title.

The Brazilian played a key role in City's second Barclays Premier League success in three seasons after joining the club from Shakhtar Donetsk for £30million last summer.

A slight niggle meant the 29-year-old had to make do with substitute roles in the last four games but he was on the field as City beat West Ham 2-0 in their final match to clinch the title at the Etihad Stadium.

Proud: Fernandinho described Man City's Premier League title win as amazing

Fernandinho said: 'Today was amazing, by the fans, the club, the team - everyone was concentrated to get the result.

'In that moment you don't know exactly what you say because the emotion is so high.

'To win the Premier League is amazing, and in the first season it is doubly amazing.

'I am so happy, I am so glad to help my team, and I am so proud to play for this team.'

New boy: The midfielder joined from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer and has won two medals already

Fernandinho was City's top target last summer and although there was plenty of wrangling over the fee with his Ukrainian club, he feels his decision to move has been fully vindicated.

Fernandinho has not only enjoyed double success with City, after the Capital One Cup win earlier in the season, but won a recall to the Brazil side in time for the World Cup.

He said: 'I think I made the right decision to come to England and Man City.

'I always say in football and life you have to win the title, and Man City gave me the chance to win the title. I am so happy for that.

'The players deserved it. We worked very hard and today was the best way to win the title.

'In the game we played very good football and we deserved that.'

Busy: Fernandinho will now travel with Man City to Abu Dhabi before turning his attention to the World Cup

Fernandinho will now be travelling with the rest of the squad for a short post-season trip to Abu Dhabi, but he intends to enjoy a break before turning attention to the World Cup in his homeland.

He said: 'I need some days off to recover the mind and the body but I will be ready for the World Cup.'

Meanwhile, defender Micah Richards has hinted that he could leave the club this summer.

Richards, a regular in the title-winning side of two years ago, has been unable to reclaim a place since losing the right-back slot to Pablo Zabaleta in an injury-hit 2012-13 campaign.

He does have one year remaining on his contract but, at 25, may now feel the time is right to move on.

Richards tweeted: 'Thanks for everything city fans! I love u and always will u made me what I am today. 4 trophies from a struggling premier league side!'
