A 73-year-old woman was dozing in her bed when she reached out to stroke what she thought was her beloved pet cat... only to discover it was a rabid raccoon.

The wild creature had climbed onto Ginny Ballou's face as she slept, before launching a vicious attack that left her covered with gashes and puncture wounds.

It had managed to sneak in through the door meant for pet cat Pretty Boy at the house in Hingham, Mass.

'She had been sleeping on her bed and she thought it was a cat and she went to pet it and found out it was a raccoon,' Sgt. Steven Dearth of the Hingham Police Department told ABC News.Â

'It began to attack her and bit onto her mouth,' he continued.

'This is a unique occurrence and something you would not expect, especially with a small pet door,' said Dearth. 'She's had this cat door for 20 years and never had any issues with anything coming in.'

The old woman struggled with the raccoon for two minutes before she managed to pry its teeth off of her lower lip.

Ginny was unavailable for comment but her daughter Jen Bowles spoke on her behalf.

She recalled how her mother 'used her land line telephone to smash it on the head.'

After the old woman retaliated, the raccoon ran out of the room and Ginny was able to call 911.

Animal Control also arrived on the scene to quell the wild animal.

When the authorities arrived, the raccoon was found hiding behind the toilet.

It was captured and taken to the vet where it tested positive for rabies and was euthanized.

Ballou was given rabies shots on Wednesday night. She is recovering from injuries which include stiches to a gash on her lip, scratches on her face and neck, and puncture wounds on her hands.
