Derek Giles, 56, admitted his role in the drug offending and was sentenced to seven years in jail

A gang of drug smugglers has been jailed for a total of 44 years after trying to import more than £1million worth of cocaine into the UK hidden in tins of a popular Jamaican vegetable dish.

One of the men, Derek Giles, 56, was a baggage handler at Gatwick Airport and was vital in helping slip the cocaine, which was secured in the tins of Jamaican Pride Callaloo, through security checks.

The five men and two women were sentenced after either admitting their role or being found guilty in the sophisticated drug
 smuggling operation at Kingston Crown Court in Surrey on Friday.

It began in April last year when Craig Accra, 33, from Liverpool, travelled to Montego Bay, Jamaica with his partner.

A month later, he met Londoners Glenroy Williams, 51, and Lawrence French, 54, in Birmingham before later meeting an unnamed associate to discuss taking up to 12 kilograms of cocaine from Jamaica to Britain for a fee of £100,000.

The plan was for the drugs to travel from Antigua to London, then from London to Holland, in an attempt to attract less attention than a direct flight from the Caribbean.

On June 12 Lee Edward Kent, 36, from Liverpool, and another person arranged to meet others in the gang in Amsterdam. However, their attempt failed when Eileen Adams, 55, also of Liverpool, panicked when she couldn't see the bag the airport luggage carousel.

Instead, she grabbed another bag from the carousel and was arrested for theft.

Unaware his operation was being watched by police and the National Crime Agency, Williams attempted to smuggle again.

This time Sharon Dixon, 51, London, travelled from Gatwick Airport to Jamaica in September.

On her September 19 return to Gatwick, she did not leave the airport as she was booked onto a transfer flight to Porto in Portugal.

As a result her baggage was 'in transfer' and therefore collected by the transfer baggage handlers.

Later that day, police raided Gatwick baggage handler Giles’ home and found a small rucksack with four sealed tins of the popular Jamaican chopped leaf vegetable labelled Jamaican Pride Callaloo in the kitchen. The tins contained cocaine with a street value of £400,000.

Callaloo is a spinach-like vegetable dish seasoned and steamed in Jamaica, often eaten for breakfast.

These are the tins in which the cocaine was found after Dixon returned to Britain from Jamaica

Inside the sealed tins of Jamaican Pride Callaloo was cocaine worth about £400,000

A
 succession of arrests followed which included the wider members of the group.

All
 the defendants pleaded guilty apart from Dixon, who denied the offence 
throughout but was found guilty at trial at Kingston Crown Court on 
March 26.

Dixon
 had previously been sentenced to a 10 year prison sentence in 1996 for 
the importation of 3kgs of cocaine in her luggage via Stanstead Airport.

Detective
 Inspector Jerry Troon from the Metropolitan Police Service’s Specialist
 Economic and Organised Crime Command said: 'These sentences are a 
satisfying culmination of months of painstaking police work by officers 
from the MPS and North West Regional Organised Crime Unit.

Those involved have had a direct link with the supply to mid-level dealers within London and Merseyside and I would like to pay tribute to my colleagues whose fine work led to their incarceration.

'This investigation shows that we will seek anyone actively involved in the drugs trade and use all the powers available to us to combat it.

'The message is clear - if you deal in drugs we will find you, we will arrest you and you will be put in front of the courts to face the consequences of your actions.'

Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson, head of operations at Titan - the North West Regional organised crime unit, said: “This was a sophisticated gang with influences in several major UK cities as well as criminal contacts abroad.

'The ringleaders devised a ploy whereby they used couriers to make several flights during the importing of the drugs to ensure their bags remained ‘in transfer’.

'They thought this would avoid detection but clearly they were wrong and law enforcement agencies became wise to their intentions at an early stage.

'Once we knew about all the people involved they were systematically arrested and incriminating evidence was found. The fact that all but one pleaded guilty showed the overwhelming evidence against them.

'Titan and the Metropolitan Police worked extremely closely to dismantle this conspiracy and seize more than a million pounds of drugs destined for the streets of cities across the UK.

'The jailing of this gang shows that there is no criminal out there that is beyond Titan’s reach.'
