A university learning specialist has received death threats and hateful messages after she exposed shockingly low academic levels among revenue athletes the University of North Carolina.

Mary Willingham found that between eight and ten per cent of college’s football and basketball players had a reading level of a third grader.

By studying eight years of test scores from University of Carolina’s revenue sports players, she found that a majority had a reading level between fourth and eighth grade.

‘We may as well go over to the elementary school up the street and let the fourth-graders and third-graders in here,’ she told CNN.

Ms Willingham looked at 183 revenue sports players at the UNC between 2004 and 2012, and found that between eight and 10 per cent read below fourth grade level and 60 per cent between fourth and eighth grade level.

Ms Willingham also discovered that up to 25 per cent of basketball and football athletes did not have the reading level to study at a community college, let alone at a university.

In the two days which have passed since her findings were published as part of a wider investigation by CNN, Ms Willingham has received four death threats and 30 'alarming messages'

‘Not people who disagree, people who put in the subject or body (of the e-mail) straight-up hate speech,’ she said.

Moneymakers: The UNC football and basketball teams generate multi-million dollar profits for the college

Early in her career as a learning specialist, Mary Willingham was in her office when a basketball player at the University of North Carolina walked in looking for help with his classwork

Football and basketball are the two sports that generate revenue for the university with men's basketball team alone making a $16.9million profit in 2012.

Ms Willingham, who also worked as a learning specialist for athletes from 2003 to 2010, told CNN of one example of a basketball player at the UNC who was completely illiterate, and another who could not read multisyllabic words, despite UNC at Chapel Hill being one of the top public universities in the U.S.

Despite admitting earlier in the investigation that officials had seen the alarming figures, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill issued a statement saying they did not believe Ms Willingham’s story and could not comment on the data used by Ms Willingham and CNN as university officials had not seen it.

However, Willingham's research into revenue sports students was based on screenings ordered and paid for by the university itself, and she has shared her findings with senior officials on at least two occasions.

A further investigation by CNN using data from 21 Tier-1 universities, including Ohio State University, Texas  A&M University and Georgia University, found that most institutions had between seven and 18 per cent of revenue sports athletes scoring below elementary school reading level.
