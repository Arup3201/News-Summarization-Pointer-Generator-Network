Shamed security firm staff have been caught downing Champagne at a £650-a-night hotel just months after the company's failure to provide workers for the Olympics forced the Government to bring in the army.

More than 300 staff members from Olympics security firm G4S gathered at an upmarket hotel and spa to celebrate the 'Security Guard of the Year 2012' on Thursday evening.

The company, which is 
still claiming £57millon from the UK taxpayer, paid for fine food and an unlimited 
free bar for the evening at Whittlebury Hall, Towcester, 
Northamptonshire.

Party: The party went on until the early hours before the staff retired to their rooms, which can cost £650 a night

Embrace: The party was held to celebrate the achievements of security staff and had a free bar

Plush: G4S also paid for entertainment and a formal dinner for staff

Party-goers enjoy a drink outside the hotel. G4S signed a £284million contract to provide 10,400 Games security guards, but just 16 days before the opening ceremony it admitted it had only fulfilled 83 per cent of contracted shifts

Those who attended enjoyed caviar, prime fillet steak and some of the hotel's hand-made cheeses as part of the black tie event, which is held annually to celebrate the achievements of staff.

The party-goers danced and drank until 1am before continuing in the hotel bar.

G4S won a £284million order to provide 10,400 security staff for the Olympic events this summer, but two weeks before the opening, thousands of British soldiers had to be drafted in after the company failed to recruit enough staff.

Other guests at the hotel spoke of their amazement that the company went ahead with the party

One woman said: 'It has been a good do hasn't it, my feet are killing me from too much dancing.'

Her colleague said: 'I think I've had a bit too much. It's been bloody good.'

But other hotel guests were furious when they spotted the G4S logo on revellers' name tags. One said: 'Isn't it marvellous to see them having such a great time after they ballsed up the Olympics.

'Who'd have thought they'd be celebrating so soon.'

A spokesperson for G4S last night said: 'This was an annual event to recognise the hard work and dedication of our frontline security staff.

'It's entirely appropriate we reward employees who go above and beyond the call of duty.'

The company’s UK boss David Taylor-Smith and events chief Ian Horseman Sewell both resigned after the Olympic staffing problems, which cost the company £50million.

Since publication of the article we have been contacted by a representative of G4S who would like us to make clear that the evening was a reward for many security officers who had nothing to do with the Olympics contract.
