Morgan Amalfitano will be disciplined by West Ham United for his ‘unprofessional’ sending off in the FA Cup humbling at the Hawthorns.

The French winger was sent on as a substitute by Sam Allardyce on the hour, only to get a straight red nine minutes later for pushing Chris Brunt in the face, seconds after receiving a yellow card for a bad foul on the West Bromwich Albion player.

Amalfitano will be banned for three matches for violent conduct and faces internal action, Allardyce confirmed.

‘The normal disciplinary procedure and measures that we have in place,’ said the West Ham boss.

He added: 'It’s another miss for next week and another body less, which was unprofessional from his point of view.

'We will probably have some players back, but we want them all back and fit because we haven't got the biggest of squads in terms of numbers.’
