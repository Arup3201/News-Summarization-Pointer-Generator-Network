Romelu Lukaku will be allowed to join Tottenham this summer - but only if Chelsea land £31.5million target Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid.

Jose Mourinho will look to revamp his forward line ahead of next season, with Atletico hotshot Costa top of his list.

The Portuguese is happy for Lukaku, who is currently on loan at Everton, to leave this summer - but he wants to capture at least two new strikers before sanctioning a permanent move for the Belgian.

Not interested? Jose Mourinho is ready to offload the Belgium striker if he can recruit a new strike force

Romelu Lukaku joined Chelsea as a promising teenager for £18million in 2011, but has made only one Premier League start for the Blues.

Instead, he's been setting the Premier League alight while on loan at West Brom and, this season, Everton.

West Brom (2012/13): 17 goals in 35 games

Everton (2013/14): 13 goals in 26 games

Lukaku knows his first-team chances 
at Stamford Bridge will be heavily restricted under Mourinho and feels 
his long-term future lies elsewhere.

Despite
 the fact he he has started just one Premier League game since joining 
in 2011, Chelsea are looking to make a profit on Lukaku.

He
 signed from Anderlecht for £18m, but the Blues will start the 
bidding for the 20-year-old at around £20m given his successful 
loan spells at West Brom and Everton.

Tottenham
 have already registered their interest in Lukaku despite the lingering 
uncertainty surrounding their management team next season.

Domino effect: Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa is likely to have a bearing on Lukaku's prospective transfer

Flop: Roberto Soldado has been disappointing since signing for Tottenham last summer

They
 are also monitoring the performances for Standard Liege's highly-rated 
striker Michy Batshuayi, who shares the same agent as Lukaku.

Likewise,
 Everton are interested in keeping Lukaku on a permanent basis, but 
their chances of funding a deal for the giant striker are likely to rest
 on qualification for the Champions League.
