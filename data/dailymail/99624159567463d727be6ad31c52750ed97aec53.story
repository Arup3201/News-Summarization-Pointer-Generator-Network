A border guard in Belarus has been jailed for two years for failing to defend the ex-soviet nation from an attack by parachuting teddy bears.

Belarus Supreme Court said Monday that the guard has been convicted of failure to report the intrusion of a light plane that dropped hundreds of teddy bears decked out in parachutes and slogans supporting human rights over the tightly-controlled country of 10 million.

The court wouldn't give his name or rank.

A border guard in Belarus has been jailed for not reporting an airdrop of teddy bears over a residential area in Minsk. The teddies, with pro democracy signs attached, were dropped by Swedish activists

Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko, dubbed 'Europe's last dictator' in the West, was furious over the July 4 incident.

Two Swedish advertising agency employees flew into Belarus' heavily guarded airspace in a show of support for human rights activists in Belarus, a nation where people were arrested for clapping, including a one-armed man, in 2011.

Lukashenko fired two generals, the head of the country's air force and the boss of border security.

President Alexander Lukashenko is the controversial leader of Belarus. He has been in power since 1994 and wields tremendous political power

'How do you explain the provocation with the airplane that not only crossed our borders, but entered the territory of Belarus unpunished?', he is reported to have thundered at officials.

He added that any future air space violations, even those by freedom-loving cuddly toys, should be brought down with anti-air missiles.

Alexander Lukashenko, a former collective farm manager, has been in power since 1994.

Two years after taking control he abandoned the country's parliament and hand-picked another just as it was about to impeach him.

Belarus is under a raft of sanctions by the European Union over the plight of political prisoners in the country.

Last year Lukashenko provoked diplomatic rebuke from Germany when he insulted the openly gay German Foreign Minister, Guido Westerwelle, by stating that it was 'better to be a dictator than gay'.

The remark was made at a summit that called for new measures to pressure Belarus over human rights abuses where Westerwelle had referred to Lukashenko as 'Europe's last dictator'.

Belarus then expelled Sweden's ambassador, Stefan Erikkson, saying: 'Mr Eriksson has worked in Minsk for seven years.

'In this time his activity has been directed not at strengthening Belarussian-Swedish relations but at destroying them.'

Stockholm said the situation was 'ridiculous'.

Sweden has been actively pushing for democracy in Belarus.

Lukashenko's re-election in December 2010, marred by fraud, led Stockholm to focus its Belarus strategy on democracy, human rights and equality.

Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt reiterated Sweden's commitment to Belarusian human rights a month after the teddy bear drop.

He wrote on Twitter: 'We remain strongly committed to the freedom of Belarus and all its citizens.

'They deserve the freedoms and the rights of the rest of Europe.'

Belarus is a former Soviet republic which became independent with the collapse of the USSR.

It still uses the rouble, its secret police is known as the KGB and the state has a powerful influence over ordinary people's lives.

Human rights campaigners in the country are persecuted and often face harrassment, beatings and prison, while the media is strictly-controlled.
