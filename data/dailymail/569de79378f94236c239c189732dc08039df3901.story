They say a dog is man's best friend, but these two canines only have eyes for each other. 

The Alaska Malamutes were married earlier today at a ceremony in Manado, Indonesia. 

The bride, Yipa, wore a garland of flowers and a white dress and the groom Buls wore a waistcoat, a shirt and a pair of glasses for the nuptials.

Two Alaskan Malamutes were married today in Manado, Indonesia. The bride, Yipa, wore a garland of flowers and a white dress and the groom Buls wore a waistcoat and a pair of glasses 

The ceremony, which was organised by a dog trainer, was held at the Mega Trade Centre in Manado. 

More than 100 people showed up to witness the dogs get married.

The animals were led up the aisle by their owners and stood at the altar as they were proclaimed husband and wife by an officiator. 

They celebrated with a slice of dog-friendly wedding cake afterwards, which had been accessorised with paw prints and a pair of model dogs made out of marzipan.

Alaskan Malamutes are extremely strong and were traditionally bred for jobs like hauling heavy freight and as sled dogs. 

But they have become increasingly used as family pets in recent years as they are an extremely affectionate breed. 

They are also known for being a very quiet dog, they rarely bark but when they do communicate, it is through howling.
