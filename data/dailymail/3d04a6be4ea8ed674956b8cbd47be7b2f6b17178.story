Drilling has begun beneath a German city by a team of Indiana Jones pensioners who believe they are on the trail of the fabled Amber Room of the Tsars.

The OAP treasure hunters are digging beneath the streets of the old industrial city of Wuppertal.

The Amber Room - valued at around £250million in today's money - was looted from the palace of Peter the Great in Soviet Russia by invading Nazi troops in 1941.

It is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from World War Two never to be found and has captivated treasure hunters ever since it was first plundered. 

Some say the panels were destroyed by Soviet artillery fire on the Prussian city of Koenigsberg, others that they were dumped in an Alpine lake by the SS in the closing days of the war. 

But Karl-Heinz Kleine, 68, and his bowling club pals, say they have proof it was entombed by the Nazis beneath the streets of Wuppertal.

The city is riddled with subterranean bunkers and tunnels dug by the Nazis. 

It is here, said Kleine, that he has received information that the crates arrived from Koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden.

He said: 'Erich Koch, the Nazi gauleiter of East Prussia who died in a Polish prison in 1986, came from Wuppertal. 

'As the Red Army closed in on Koenigsberg, he ordered the treasure to be packed up and brought back to his hometown. We have studied records and spoken to people from the time. 

'He did not want to leave the world's greatest treasure in a region with an unknown political future; rather he brought it to a place he knew where he had a good chance of accessing it in the future. In his own backyard.'

Opulent: A complete restoration of the Amber Room in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg, the original of which was plundered by the Nazis in World War Two, but has since disappeared

The £250million room, consisting of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin, took ten years to complete. It is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from World War Two never to be found

The local authority have given Karl-Heinz and his four friends permission to dig in the Nazi structures and a local building firm has loaned them some heavy drilling equipment. 

'I can't reveal who our sources are, but we are not doing this for fun,' he added. 'We will find the Amber Room here.'

Others have been just as certain in the past. The Maigret author Georges Simenon founded the Amber Room Club after World War Two to track it down once and for all. 

Everyone had a different theory of what might have befallen the work. 

Plundered: The remains of the Amber Room after it was seized by the Nazis, who packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to Germany, where they vanished never to be seen again

Stripped bare: Some say the panels were destroyed by Soviet artillery fire on the East Prussian city of Koenigsberg, while others claim they were dumped in an Alpine lake by the SS in the closing days of the war

Destroyed: Peter the Great received the room as a gift from the King of Prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital, St Petersburg. Here it is seen before restoriation

The Amber Room consists of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin, took ten years to complete and is valued at some £250million in today's money.

Peter the Great received the room as a gift from the King of Prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital, St Petersburg.

The 16-feet of jigsaw-puzzle style panels were constructed of more than 100,000 perfectly fitted pieces of amber. 

In 1755, it was moved to the Catherine Palace at Tsarkoe Selo, 17 miles south of the Imperial Russian capital.

In 1941, the approaching Nazi army surrounded the city, then known by its Soviet name of Leningrad.

Tsarkoe Selo was one of the outlying areas occupied by the Germans. 

They packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to Germany, where they vanished.

Dozens of theories have been put forward for their whereabouts and in some cases, millions spent trying to unearth the treasure, but as yet nothing has been found. 

In 2006 an American team spent £7million diving into the glacial waters of Lake Toplitz in Austria.

Norman Scott, the founder of Global Explorations, said he had a witness who he says specifically counted 27 crates going to the waters of the lake in April 1945, one month before the capitulation of Nazi Germany.

Paperwork from the RHSA - the Reich Main Security Office of the SS in wartime - shows the Amber Room was packed into precisely 27 crates before it was taken away by the Germans from Russia. 

The team also say the Cyrillic lettering on the remains of a wooden crate they found, bearing the words 'fragile' and numbered could mean it once contained a piece of the Amber Room jigsaw.

Lake Toplitz was used by Hitler's forces in the last two years of the war for secret underwater experiments using dynamite and rockets.

It later turned it into a dumping ground for anything the Nazis wanted to hide from the advancing Allies.

But the lake has yielded little since WW2, except for forged £5 notes which were printed by the Nazis and intended to cause chaos for the British economy.  

In 2011, a book published in Germany claimed the room lies hidden in old mine workings in a forest in east Germany.

'The Puzzle of Poppen Wood' by Mario Ulbrich unleashed a fresh wave of treasure hunters who arrived at weekends with shovels, metals detectors and vast reserves of optimism to scour for the artwork.

Ulbrich interviewed foresters, policemen, miners and old Nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near Zwickau.

Matthias Gluba, a civil engineer and hobby historian on WW2, has triggered another Amber Room frenzy after researching wartime records of the town of Auerswalde near Chemnitz.

Auerswalde was the place where Hitler built the two biggest guns in history - Dora and Gustav - both mighty railway mounted monsters capable of hurling shells weighing tons.

As he probed into the history of the cannons he discovered plans for secret underground workings. 

Then he found details of a clandestine shipment from the city of Koenigsberg - now Kaliningrad and part of Russia but in 1945 the main city of Germany's province of East Prussia - which was the last known storage place of the Amber Room before it fell to the Red Army.

Art haul: The room was plundered by Adolf Hitler's Nazis during the Second World War

Prussian count Sommes Laubach, the Germans' 'art protection officer' and holder of a degree in art history, supervised the room's transport to Koenigsberg Castle from the Soviet Union. 

In January 1945, after air raids and a savage ground assault on the city, the room was lost.

Gluba found documents about an air raid on the marshalling yards of Breslau - then German, now the Polish city of Wroclaw - on 4 February 1945. 

The army report stated that 40 wagons from Koneigsberg, which had fallen days earlier to the Red Army, were undamaged in the attack and were moving down to Auerswalde 'under conditions of the greatest secrecy.'

Gunter Richter, now 80, is an Auerswalde resident who told Glube that, as a child, he remembered in the Muna Forest outside the town a massive shelter built for munitions works employees that he went into as a boy. 

It vanished off of maps after the war but in March 2011 he and Gluba managed to find a ventilation shaft that leads down into a subterranean structure they believe is the old shelter.

They, and others, have still not managed to access it.

Many Amber Room purists believe the treasure lies in the Jonas Valley in what was the former German Democrat Republic. 

It is the most dangerous of the hunting grounds and draws scores of illegal searchers every weekend.

The centre of the Jonas Valley is at Ohrdruf and was the site of the S-IIIFuhrer headquarters. It is a tunnel system many miles in length with thousands of caves, bunkers and storerooms. 

It was intended to be the Alamo of the Third Reich leadership.

Americans liberated it and US authorities have since classified all 1945 documents relating to Ohrdruf for a minimum of 100 years.

'Like no other place in Germany this wild canyon has ignited the fantasies of an international league of conspiracy theorists and treasure hunters, 'wrote Der Spiegel, Germany's top news magazine.

Both above and below ground, the area is littered with shells and bombs big enough to destroy a city block. 

At weekends authorities play cat-and-mouse with the treasure hunters who enter the sealed-off area illegally in ones and twos - and sometimes in mini-bus groups - armed with metal detectors and a belief in the stories.

Fortune hunter Martin Stade, author of 'Amber Rooms In Thuringia And Other Hollow Spaces,' likes to guide treasure seekers through the Jonas Valley. 

Stade believes that Hitler had UFO-like flying saucers developed in bunkers at the site - as well as using one of the chambers as a repository for the Amber Room.
