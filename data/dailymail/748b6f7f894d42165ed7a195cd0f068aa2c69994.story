A New York Yankees ball boy may soon find himself a whole lot richer.

The young man, whose name is still unknown, pocketed a foul ball hit by Derek Jeter last night during the baseball's stars final home game at Yankee Stadium, and some are saying the ball could fetch as much as $10,000.

And while the ball boy, or girl, is expected to toss all foul balls into the crowd for the fans, there is no official rule that says they cannot keep the ball.

Piece of history: A foul ball hit by Derek Jeter (above) at this last home game ever could be worth $10,000

Foul?: The ball was actually kept by the ball boy (above) rather than given to a fan in the stands

It all happened when the Yankees took on the Baltimore Orioles and Jeter pulled a foul ball down the left field line in the bottom of the fifth inning.

The young man cleanly fielded the grounder, held it in his glove, and then reached into his back pocket pulling out another ball and handing it off to a fan in the stands. 

It is uncertain if the boy kept the ball for himself, or if the Yankees asked those on the field to hold on to the balls for the sake of having Jeter memorabilia.

The Yankees may have also wanted to avoid hysteria or fighting among fans for the ball.

Fair play: There is no rule that says a ball boy, or girl, can't keep a ball

If it is the former, it was one lucrative move for the man, as some are saying it could fetch up to $10,000.

'It’s a pretty great thing, I’d love to have it for our auction,' Kevin Bronson, director of acquisitions at Leland Sports Auction House, told ABC News.

That being said, the young man is going to have to strike while the iron is hot.

'It’s worth the most it’s ever going to be worth last night,' said Bronson. 

'As Jeter fades from the spotlight, so do prices.'

No doubt making the ball even more valuable is how Jeter ended his last home game ever yesterday- with a walkoff RBI single.

That's one epic way to go out. 

Jeter will finish up his career this weekend at Fenway Park, as the Yankees take on their longtime rivals, the Boston Red Sox.
