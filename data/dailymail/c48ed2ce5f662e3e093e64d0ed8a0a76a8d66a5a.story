High court bid: Terror suspect Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, who is on the run after fleeing in a burka, has submitted a human rights claim

Burka-wearing fugitive Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed provoked fury last night by demanding up to £1million in compensation from the taxpayer in yet another human rights fiasco.

To astonishment at Westminster, the High Court yesterday ruled the terror suspect can make a claim for civil damages using legal aid – despite being on the run.

It came as Sir John Sawers, the head of MI6, told a public hearing that the intelligence agencies had been ‘sickened’ by terrorists getting large payouts through unfounded compensation claims.

Mohamed alleges he was ill-treated after his arrest in Somaliland in 2011.

The jihadist, linked to the murderous Al Shabaab gang, is suspected of receiving terror training overseas and plotting attacks against western interests.

But his lawyers claim he was mistreated by his Somaliland interrogators with the knowledge of British security agents and are demanding huge sums in compensation for breach of Labour’s Human Rights Act.

The fact Mohamed is on the run – after cutting off his tagging device at a London mosque last Friday –  has not halted the case.

The terror suspect was referred to in court papers as ‘MA’ but anonymity was lifted yesterday following his disappearance.

A second compensation claim is being made by another alleged jihadist, known only by the initials CF.

The case sparked incredulity at Westminster and new demands for the scrapping of the Human Rights Act.

If Mohamed is ever caught, he will still be entitled to pocket any award of compensation. Senior Tory backbencher Sir Gerald Howarth said the claim was a farce.

‘The abuse of the human rights legislation has now reached such offensive proportions that I think we will have to consider repealing it in this Parliament,’ he said.

He added: ‘What are the courts doing? Some seem to live on another planet.’

Tory backbencher Philip Hollobone said: ‘The British public is fed up to the back teeth of Muslim terror suspects trying it on with the British justice system.

'It is yet further evidence of why we need to leave the European Convention on Human Rights so we can properly seal our borders against such people.’

Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s important that British security services are properly scrutinised, but with Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed absconding this case should surely be halted before any further costs to taxpayers are incurred.’

Mohamed travelled to Somaliland to undergo terrorist training in 2007. CF travelled there two years later.

Both were detained by authorities in Somaliland on January 14, 2011 and held until their removal back to the UK on March 14 that year.

They say they were tortured and mistreated during their detention and claim the Government is liable to pay them damages under the 1998 Human Rights Act for complicity in their alleged ill-treatment.

Mohamed alleges that British authorities knew he was about to be arrested and that this was demonstrated by the Home Secretary’s application for a control order against him ‘as a precaution’ prior to his detention.

An order was sanctioned by High Court judge Mr Justice Silber on January 13, 2011.

Mohamed has lodged claims against the Foreign Office, Home Office, Ministry of Defence and the Attorney General.

An estimated £30million has already been paid to at least 16 terror suspects who claim the security services were complicit in their ill-treatment.

The cases of Mohamed and CF will be heard partially in secret, the High Court ruled yesterday.

The Government denies acting unlawfully in relation to their detention in Somaliland and says both men lack credibility, and no weight can be placed on their evidence.

Yesterday, in evidence to Parliament’s Security and Intelligence Committee, head of MI6 Sir John Sawers said intelligence agency staff had been ‘sickened’ by some of the compensation payouts made to terror suspects.

He said the security services had been unable to defend themselves  against the allegations, which they denied, in open court.

The hearing was the first time the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ had given evidence in public.

Legal sources said legal aid for Mohamed could be withdrawn if he is not caught. Solicitors must be able to show they are taking instruction from their client to be entitled to state support.
