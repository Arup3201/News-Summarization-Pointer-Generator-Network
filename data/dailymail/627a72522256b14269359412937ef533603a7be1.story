Sacked: Elaine McHale, 57, has lost her latest £110,000-a-year job at Leicester City Council after her department failed to allocate social workers to look after hundreds of vulnerable children

A council manager who retired from her £160,000-a-year job after the deaths of four children only to take a new social services job has been sacked after a fresh scandal, MailOnline can reveal today.

Elaine McHale lost her £110,000-a-year job at Leicester City Council after her team failed to allocate social workers to look after hundreds of vulnerable children.

Leicester's Labour mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has said Ms McHale was sacked after her 'botched review' caused her social services department to 'fall apart', which could have put children in the city at risk.

But MailOnline can reveal that she moved to Leicester despite retiring from her £159,346-a-year job (total remuneration including pension contribution) at Wakefield Borough Council in 2012 as it emerged that the deaths of four children were being investigated. 

One of the serious case reviews probed by child protection experts was the murder of five-year-old Haroon Bhatti by his father Pazeer Ahmed, who burnt then beat his son to death.

Ms McHale announced she was retiring from her job as director for family services a day after Ahmed was jailed for life, the council said the timing was coincidental.

Another of the reviews considered whether the authorities could have stopped the murder of eight-week-old  Grace Barnes, who had her skull crushed  by her father Richard  in November 2011 after getting drunk on  beer, whisky and vodka.

Wakefield Council insisted Ms McHale's retirement  had been spoken about for 'some time' before the four serious case reviews were announced.

But instead of retiring completely she then moved to Leicester City Council as Strategic Director Adult Social Care and Health earning between £110,000 and £115,000-a-year until her departure on Friday.

Revealing her sacking, Sir Peter Soulsby said there had been a 'complete failure' to inform the council's leadership about the scandal, which meant Elaine McHale was dismissed with immediate effect.

He added that her management meant 'children have potentially been put at risk and this cannot be tolerated'.

Ms McHale was sacked with cabinet member Vi Dempster after the council was presented with a draft report of a recent Ofsted inspection of its social services department.

Inspectors found that a poorly-managed review of front-line social workers carried out in the summer of 2014 by Ms McHale 'resulted in more than 30 leaving the authority  during which time vulnerable children were put at risk by not being allocated the social workers they needed', the council said today.

Critics have today demanded an end to the 'merry-go-round' at the top of councils where staff on huge salaries are allowed to resign or retire after scandals only to quickly find a new 'cushy' job.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's bad enough when taxpayers foot the bill for enormous salaries at town halls, but it's quite another when they are paying rewards for failure. 

'What really angers hard-working taxpayers, though, is when council top brass are removed from their post but find themselves in a cushy role elsewhere in the public sector. More has to be done to bring this merry-go-round to a grinding halt.' 

After her recent sacking Ms McHale has also been suspended as  chairman of the  Bradford Safeguarding Children Board, a role where she could charge up to £500-per-day for her services.

She was offered the job last year despite concerns over whether she was as suitable appointment but was removed from her post today.

A Bradford Council spokesman said: 'This morning Bradford Safeguarding Children Board (BSCB) and Bradford Council have become aware that Elaine McHale's interim contract as Director of Adult Services at Leicester City Council has been terminated. 

'Following discussions with Ms McHale, it has been agreed that she will be temporarily removed, without prejudice, from her position as independent chair of the BSCB whilst enquiries are ongoing'. 

Ms McHale was unavailable for comment today.
