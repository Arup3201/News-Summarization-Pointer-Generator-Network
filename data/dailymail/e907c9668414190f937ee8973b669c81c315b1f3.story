Ever wondered what it's like to parachute into a sports stadium full of tens of thousands of screaming fans?

Well, now you don't have to because the U.S. Navy Skydiving Team - aka The Leap Frogs - has done it for you ... and filmed the experience on a head-mounted camera.

The footage begins with the team looking out through the plane's hatch over the Californian city of San Diego.

Go, go, go! The footage begins with the team looking out through the plane's hatch over the Californian city of San Diego

Dramatic: As they approach their target - The San Diego Padres' home ground at Petco Park - the roar of the crowd below can be heard getting louder

Their target - The San Diego Padres' home ground at Petco Park - is a mere speck in the distance.

Then they jump.

Circling above California's second largest city, the roar of the wind is replaced by the roar of the crowd, growing louder as they approach the stadium.

Roaring wind: The team of three comprised Jim Woods, who wore the head-cam, Vic Maldonado and Brad Woodard, who both carried flags, one bearing the late Jerry Coleman's initials and one with his trademark star

T marks the spot: All three land within a yard of their target to wild cheering from the fans

The jump was in honour of baseball legend Jerry Coleman, a New York Yankees second-baser who was named the Major League's most valuable payer in 1950 and manager of the Padres in 1980. He died on January 5 this year.
