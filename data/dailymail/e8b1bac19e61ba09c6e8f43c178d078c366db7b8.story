An orphaned baby aardvark which was less than three months old when its mother was shot by a farmer has found a loving home at a nature reserve.

Little Barkie was found confused and frightened near the N/a'an ku sê Wildlife Sanctuary in Namibia, where his near-hairless body was at risk from the African winter nights.

Staff at the reserve near the capital Windhoek now take him out for daily walks to accustom him to his environment - and even have a special pair of 'pyjamas' to keep him warm.

Aardvarks are common in large parts of Africa but they come into conflict with farmers, because they often dig holes through which livestock can escape into predators' jaws.

When female aardvarks are shot their young are left vulnerable, because they usually remain by their mother's side for the first six months of their lives. 

Staff said Barkie is now recovering well on a healthy foraged diet of termites and other insects.  

A spokesperson for the sanctuary said: 'The killing of aardvarks is tragically a common occurrence in Nambia, where farmers and landowners heavily depend on their livestock to eke a living out of this desert land.

'The natural burrowing and digging behaviour of aardvark inadvertently causes holes in fences that allow the livestock to escape, making them vulnerable to free-roaming carnivores.

A spokesman for the sanctuary said: 'The behaviour of these elusive creatures has remained undiscovered, but with Barkie's help we hope to erase their misunderstood reputation of these magnificent mammals'

Every cloud: Aardvarks, with huge ears, noses and tongues, normally remain with their mothers for six months

Unusual: The name aardvark means 'ant pig' in Afrikaans, the language of South Africa's original Dutch settlers

'Sadly aardvarks have gained an increasingly negative reputation which is wholly misunderstood. Barkie's mother suffered this fate but her helpless baby was thankfully taken pity on.

'The bush walks give Barkie the chance to fully embrace his natural instincts.

'We carefully consider the natural needs of every orphan tending away from the feeling of captivity. Instead we create an environment where their instinctive behaviours are nurtured and encouraged.

'The behaviour of these elusive creatures has remained largely undiscovered, but with Barkie's help we hope to erase the misunderstood reputation of these magnificent mammals.'

Unpopular: Barkie's mother was shot by a farmer. Many hate aardvarks for burrowing tunnels under their land

A similar species to anteaters in the U.S., aardvarks live across Africa south of the Sahara desert.

Their name literally means 'earth pig' in Afrikaans, the language of the original Dutch settlers in South Africa, but their bodies appear to fuse together elements from rabbits and even kangaroos.

With bodies measuring more than 4ft long, the termite-eating animals have to be prodigious diggers to break into ant mounts.

As well as long tongues to scoop out the unlucky termites, they have claws which resemble small spades to break open earthen anthills which have been hardened like brick by the sun.

Those claws also help dig the burrows in which they live and where they sleep during the day, particularly in summer when the hot African sun makes it difficult to forage for food.
