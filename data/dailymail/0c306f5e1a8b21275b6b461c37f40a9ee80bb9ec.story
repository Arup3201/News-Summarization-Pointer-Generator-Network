Anonymity app Secret has made waves since it emerged from Silicon Valley two months ago.

The app showcases startling confessions about what a person really thinks but isn’t willing to share on sites like Twitter and Facebook.

Now Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg could be about to cash in on the trend by reportedly launching a Secret-like app of his own.

Mystery meeting: Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has contacted the Secret app founders about the idea, according to sources speaking to Re/code's Mike Isaac

Zuckerberg has even contacted Secret about the idea, according Re/code's Mike Isaac, although he believes this was an acquisition talk.

‘Rumours of a $100 million (£60 million) offer from Facebook to buy Secret that reverberated through Silicon Valley this week were shot down by two people familiar with the social networking giant’s plans,’ said Mr Isaac.

The move is a drastic departure from Facebook’s current stance of not allowing users to display fake names. Facebook is yet to comment on the rumours.

Confidential: The Secret app allows people to post anonymous 
messages - however, their friends are alerted that 'a fiend' has posted,
 raising fears the service could be misused

Secret, launched two months ago, was created by two former Google engineers who were looking for a way to let people deliver genuine feedback to co-workers. 

The app tells users  when a friend has posted a secret — they just don't know which friend. It has been especially popular in Silicon Valley and its satellite technology communities outside of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Secret tries to add a layer of accountability to anonymous posts by showing users' secrets to their friends and allowing only friends, or friends of friends, to comment on each shared post.

To sign up, users provide their mobile phone number, email address or both. When you post a secret, your phone and email contacts who are also on Secret will be able to see it.

If they tap a heart icon indicating that they ‘love’ your secret, then their friends will be able to see it too. You won't know which of your friends is on Secret.

Secret says it ensures security by encrypting posts and without uploading contact information to its servers.

The app also offers a panic button, called ‘unlink my posts.’ When a user clicks it, any link between them and all previous secrets they have posted is removed.

However, in December Bloomberg Businessweek noted that this could be about to change after Facebook hosted a three-day hacker event in which apps that could be used anonymously were developed.

The event was part of a project called Facebook Creative Labs with aims to develop a variety of new apps for the social media site.

Although anonymity apps are being criticised as platforms for bullying, supporters say they can be tools for preventing mischief. They also have a cathartic value for some users.

‘My baby boy passed away recently. I saw his picture today and cried. I cried because I love him and miss him. I'm a guy, so no one thinks to talk to me,’ read a recent post on Secret.

Another recent Secret message read: ‘Fact: It's downright scary to hire your first woman onto an all-male team.’

Steve Jones, a professor who studies online culture and communications at the University of Illinois at Chicago, believes there's a ‘significant degree to which people want to be associated with their words,’ get comments, likes and acknowledgements for them.

Anonymity apps, he says, could have a difficult time maintaining a business model because they are exposing themselves to a lot of liability.

‘I don't want to dismiss the optimistic view that the makers of these apps have,’ he said. ‘But I don't have that much evidence yet that these apps are appealing for a better nature.’
