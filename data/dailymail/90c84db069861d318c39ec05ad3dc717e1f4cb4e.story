Australian first home buyers are getting older as skyrocketing house prices and dwindling government grants force them to save longer and cut back harder on other things so they can pull together a deposit.

A new report by realestateVIEW.com.au shows the largest group of first home buyers is now people in their thirties or forties. And just one in ten first home buyers are younger than 30, the report says

The main reasons include rising house prices and a lack of government grants, according to the report.

People are also forgoing big ticket items like cars and are happy to cut back on buying clothes, computers and going away on holidays to help save a deposit.

The age of first home buyers in Australia is stretching with most people now in their thirties or forties before they purchase a property, according to a new report

'When we think of first time buyers we think of singles or couples in their twenties, but the reality is the road to achieving home ownership is longer and harder than it once was,' General Manager of realestateVIEW.com.au, Petra Sprekos, told Daily Mail Australia.

'More people want to save 20 percent deposit and pay more than their mortgage repayments require, so they are spending at least three to five years saving for a deposit.

'People view buying property as biggest achievement so they’re cutting other expenditure to support dream.'

The First Home Buyer Report is based on a national survey of more than 1,000 Australian first home buyers, first home owners and non-buyers.

Half of first home buyers and more than 60 per cent of first home owners have children - an indication Australians are taking longer to enter the market

Over a third of those surveyed haven't bought a property yet because they think house prices are too high.  

'Over the last 12 months in particular we've seen house prices rise and it's putting pressure on people's abilities to fund mortgage repayments,' Ms Sprekos said.  

'Demographic changes are also behind it. We used to see people buy a house and then have kids, but it's actually happening the other way now. It's just taking people a little bit long for people to buy now.

Ms Sprekos says the government is to blame for challenges facing first time buyers.

'The reduction in first home buyer concessions is a big challenge. We saw a real stimulation in the market when the federal government brought in the grants,' she said. 

The report found only one in four people surveyed just didn't want to get into the market at all

'There's no incentive there now... and the government needs to start looking after the next generation of buyers. Age has progressively increased so some intervention is required.These trends are going up and affordability is becoming an issue.'

The report found only one in four people surveyed just didn't want to get into the market at all. 

'They're shunning the market. 75 percent of those people believe they can't afford those mortgage repayments and 25 percent say they just want to spend their money in other ways.'
