Louis van Gaal held a one-hour summit with Manchester United's players to dissect Sunday's shock defeat at Leicester City, striker Robin van Persie has revealed.

The Dutch manager was left fuming as Leicester stormed back from 3-1 down to win 5-3 at the King Power Stadium, inflicting United's second league defeat of the season.

And his compatriot, who scored United's opening goal, said the squad had a 'proper look' at what had gone wrong the next day.

Louis van Gaal held an hour-long meeting with his Man United squad after Sunday's 5-3 defeat at Leicester

Robin van Persie, who scored United's first goal at Leicester, said Van Gaal confronted the players 

Van Persie told Fox Sports News: 'It shouldn't be possible [to lose in such a manner], but it still happened. We have to deal with it.

'We had a proper look at it next day. Sometimes it was a bit confronting and it was a long meeting. One hour something.

'We went from there, started again this week [and put] a couple of really good sessions in. Everyone feels ready to face West Ham.'

He added: 'When you look at the defensive mistakes, it starts somewhere else. That's what we looked at as well. It's not just the one mistake which happens.

'There's a mistake before the mistake and before the mistake, maybe positional wise.'

United host West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday as they aim to get their season back on track.

They have just five points from five league matches so far and sit a lowly 12th in the table.
