An artist has created a disgusting collection of work by making more than 50,000 flies vomit on his canvases.

The revolting artwork is made by encouraging flies to throw-up sugar, water and watercolour paint.

Artist John Knuth, 35, says he is taking advantage of flies’ digestive system to create the paintings – the largest of which measure up to 6ft tall and 4ft wide. 

This painting was created by John Knuth who makes up to 55,000 flies vomit on his various canvases

Mr Knuth takes advantage of the fact flies cannot chew. Instead, it must first regurgitate a mixture of saliva and partly-digested material onto what it is about to consume. This liquidises the food and leaves 'flyspeck'

Fly vomit art is a revolting idea, but Mr Knuth is not the first to disgust audiences by using animals for his work.

In 1995, Damien Hirst won a Turner Prize in 1995 with a rotting cow’s head.

Chris Ofili has also profited from a gruesome idea, winning the prize in 1998 for a painting made with elephant dung.

Meanwhile, even the faeces, urine and blood of humans has also been used to create art in the past.

Perhaps most famously, singer Pete Doherty has in the past used his own blood to create a number of paintings.

An exhibition of his work in 2008 featured a self-portrait, a gory illustration of his former girlfriend, Kate Moss, and one of his needles.

‘I grew up catching snakes and looking at Andy Warhol books,' he said.

‘As I developed as an artist, I became interested in how flies spread disease and how that could be used to create art.

‘I knew that the disease spread through their digestive system, but I wasn't sure how the biology worked. I found out more about it and discovered that during the process of eating, flies leave marks called 'flyspeck' which is essentially their vomit.

‘I started experimenting with different ways to make paintings with this fly vomit.’

Mr Knuth takes advantage of the fact flies cannot chew. Instead, before it can eat, the insect must first regurgitate a mixture of saliva and partly-digested material onto what it is about to consume. This liquidises the food, allowing the fly to suck it up, and leaving 'flyspeck' - a small splash of fly vomit.

Mr Knuth's method is to mix sugared water with watercolours to ensure the flies regurgitate sugary paint onto his canvasses.

Houseflies generally only live for a month and each painting can take up to three months to complete - meaning several generations of flies work on one canvas.

The largest paintings, which are 6ft tall and 4ft wide, are created by populations of up to 55,000 flies.

The paintings form a series entitled 'Made in Los Angeles'

Mr Knuth said: ‘I buy maggots from a supplier - people usually buy maggots for fishing, or to feed their pets or for classroom experiments, but not me.

‘I make the canvases, then paint a background color to use as a base for the rest of the painting.

‘I stand two canvasses together, facing each other, and surround them with a screen. I then put maggots in the middle. The screen means that when they hatch, the flies can't get out.

‘Once the maggots have pupated and are starting to hatch into flies, I mix paint and sugar and water, and let the flies get to work.’

Mr Knuth, of Los Angeles, said the collection is representative of the city

He said: 'When I started I fed the flies McDonald's cheeseburgers and Taco Bell, and that turned my thoughts towards the paintings being a microcosm for Los Angeles'

The paintings, which form a series entitled 'Made in Los Angeles', were produced for a project by LA's prestigious Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA).

A film of the series, shot by John Toba and Andy Featherston for the MOCAtv project, details the paintings which appear largely uniform from a distance but reveal amazing detail on closer inspection.

Mr Knuth, of Los Angeles, said the collection is representative of the city.

He said: ‘When I started I fed the flies McDonald's cheeseburgers and Taco Bell, and that turned my thoughts towards the paintings being a microcosm for Los Angeles.

‘As I worked with the flies more, I liked how I could get them to create something beyond their nature - that I could get these nasty animals to create something transcendent.

‘Flies are non-social insects, meaning they don't make a hive like bees or a colony like ants. I have condensed them into a tight space unnaturally for them to make the paintings.

‘I am interested in “base level alchemy” - taking something base or mundane like flies, and turning it into something transcendent.’
