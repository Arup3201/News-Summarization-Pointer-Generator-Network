Six more ex-News of the World have been arrested in London and Cheshire as part of a new police investigation into phone hacking.

In a dramatic twist to the ongoing saga, Scotland Yard detectives from the Operation Weeting inquiry said they are looking into a suspected conspiracy that took place between around 2005 and 2006.

Three men and three women were arrested this morning and are being interviewed at police stations in London and Cheshire. Five of the six were released on bail last night.

The Metropolitan Police say the arrests relate to a new phone hacking conspiracy which has emerged as part of the Operation Weeting investigation

They are understood to be Jules Stenson, Matt Nixson, Rav Singh, Jane Atkinson, Polly Graham and Rachel Richardson. Ms Richardson and Ms Atkinson both work for The Sun.

The Met said the arrests were made as part of a fresh line of inquiry that is separate from allegations under the existing Operation Weeting investigation.

Two men aged 45 and 46 were held in Wandsworth, south London, and a 39-year-old man was arrested in Greenwich, south east London.

The three women arrested were a 39-year-old who was detained in Cheshire, a 33-year-old in Islington, north London, and a 40-year-old in Lambeth, south London.

They were all arrested on 'suspicion of conspiracy to intercept telephone communications'.

Detectives say they plan to speak to people they believe have been victims of the suspected phone hacking and searches are being carried out at a number of addresses.

It brings the total number of arrests in Operation Weeting to 32.

There are currently three Met inquiries into the scandal: Weeting into phone hacking, Elveden into corrupt payments and Tuleta into computer hacking.

The Met said none of the six journalists have been arrested before in connection with any of the inquiries.

The total number of individuals arrested in relation to all three inquiries is now 106.

An internal message has been sent to News International employees confirming that two of those arrested are journalists currently working for The Sun.

The pair have been provided with lawyers.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
