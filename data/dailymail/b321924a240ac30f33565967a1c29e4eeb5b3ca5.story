A man in China blocked a road and started to collect tolls from motorists after his mother's pet dog was run over and killed.

Police say the man wanted to recoup the 2,000 renminbi (£188) it would cost him to replace her the animal in Nanjing City in Jiangsu.

Su Cheng said the dog had ‘brought great happiness’ to his mother who is in her 70s. On Saturday, the dog was run over and killed by a passing truck.

Su’s mother Gao was walking the dog when it was hit and was also nearly knocked by the lorry when she tried to stop it after the accident.

The driver however had not only carried on without stopping, he had even sped up.

 ‘Su and his mother were quite angry, but they couldn’t find the guilty trucker,’ said a police spokesman. ‘To vent out their anger, Su and another two family members blocked the road to charge toll fees to passing trucks.’

For each truck, Su charged 10RMB (94p) and he wrote down the plate number of the lorries in a notebook to know which ones had been charged.

‘According to Su, he would not stop until he collected the full 2,000 RMB from the passing by vehicles,’ added the police spokesman. ‘The truckers were annoyed and reported the case to the police.’ 

Police forced the bereaved Cheng to repay the lorry drivers and said he was not within his rights to penalise all lorry drivers for the actions of one.

Cheng said: ‘I only wanted enough money to be able to buy my mum a new dog. She is a lovely old lady and needs companionship.’
