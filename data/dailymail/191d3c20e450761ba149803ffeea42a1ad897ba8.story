Britain and the West face a decades-long battle against Islamist terrorism in North Africa, a grim-faced David Cameron warned today.

The Prime Minister said the attack was a 'stark reminder' of the threat from the region, which he likened to that from Afghanistan and Pakistan - and vowed to use Britain's chairmanship of the G8 group of leading nations to shape the international response.

Government sources played down the prospect of British 'boots on the ground' in support of a French-led intervention against terrorists in Mali but said a new approach was needed to address Africa's 'huge, lawless, ungoverned spaces'.

David Cameron said the threat of Islamic fundamentalism in North Africa will require a 'global response'

The Prime Minister, who will address 
the Commons again on the crisis tomorrow, said: 'This is a global threat
and it will require a global response.

'It will require a response that is about years, even decades, rather than months.

'It
requires a response that is patient and painstaking, that is tough but 
also intelligent, but above all has an absolutely iron resolve and that 
is what we will deliver over these coming years.

'What
we face is an extremist, Islamist, al Qaeda-linked terrorist group. 
Just as we had to deal with that in Pakistan and in Afghanistan so the 
world needs to come together to deal with this threat in north Africa.

'It
is linked to al Qaeda, it wants to destroy our way of life, it believes
in killing as many people as it can. We need to work with others to 
defeat the terrorists and to close down the ungoverned spaces where they
thrive with all the means that we have.'

French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the bloodbath in Algeria as an 'act of war'.

The French media have dubbed the bloody siege as 'Europe's September 11.'

'What
strikes me the most is that we're saying "hostage-taking" but when 
there are so many people concerned, I think this is an act of war,' he 
said.

Speaking on the 
BBC's Andrew Marr Show, William Hague, the foreign secretary, said it 
was 'quite likely' that some of the Britons were executed by the group, 
which identified itself as the Signers in Blood – a splinter group of 
al-Qaida in the Islamic Mahgreb.

Mr
Hague confirmed that Britain had not been consulted about the Algerian 
decision to launch the attack, adding: 'Of course, we would have liked 
to have been consulted, but they decided as a sovereign country that 
this was something on their soil that they would deal with and that they
needed to deal with urgently.'

He
said the Algerians had acted swiftly because their military believed 
the hostage-takers were planning to blow up the installation, posing an 
imminent threat to the lives of their captives.

Foreign Secretary William Hague told Jeremy Vine of BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show that the Algerian army had believed the entire installation where the hostages were being held was going to be destroyed

Government sources sought to downplay the significance of a recording of one of the terror leaders, Abdel Rahman al-Nigeri, saying 'I have spoken to the British' in recording of talks with Algerian Special Forces.

Initial contacts are thought to have been made by BP, which runs the refinery where the hostages were taken.

But officials say there was 'no question' of negotiations over any concessions being demanded by the group.

'Whatever people think of them, whatever has been said about the Algerian military, they are experienced,' Mr Hague added.

'The Algerians had to make very difficult decisions. We know from decisions about hostage rescues how very, very difficult they are.

'The Algerians believe that the plan of the terrorists was to blow up the entire installation thereby killing all or most of the hostages in any case and so yes, what they have done has been driven by the belief that negotiation couldn't succeed and that the lives of the hostages were in great and imminent danger in any case.'

In what appeared to be a concerted effort to row back from initial criticism of the Algerian response, the Prime Minister said responsibility for the deaths 'lies squarely with the terrorists who launched a vicious and cowardly attack'.

'No one should underestimate the difficulties of responding to an attack on this scale with 30 terrorists absolutely determined to take lives, and we should recognise all the Algerians have done to work with us and to help and co-ordinate with us, and I'd like to thank them for that,' he said.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox said the 'squeeze' on al-Qaeda in their heartlands of Pakistan and Afghanistan had forced them into other ungoverned areas.

Former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Stirrup said Britain needed to be 'very careful how we tread in this particular area'.

He said: 'There is a tendency to characterise this as some sort of global jihadist campaign when, in fact, in many circumstances in many of these areas
