Cambridge graduates are the most employable in the world, according to a global league table.

The ancient university is the best at producing graduates who are ‘ready to work’, a poll of major employers found.

Oxford slipped to fourth place in the rankings having taken top spot last year. Harvard and Yale – part of the US ‘Ivy League’ of universities – were second and third respectively.

Five British universities were ranked in the top 20 – one more than last year – and 12 were in the full list of 150, with only the US boasting greater overall representation in the table.

But the UK as a country came third – behind the US and Germany - when companies were asked to name the best nation for producing work-ready graduates.

The table – the Global Employability University Ranking published by the International New York Times – also showed that universities in Asian countries were rapidly gaining ground on their western counterparts.

Asian universities claimed 20 per cent of the top 150 places in 2014 compared with only 10 per cent when the tables were first published in 2010.

The other British universities in the top 20 were University College London, in 14th place, Imperial College London, in 15th, and Edinburgh, 18th. 

The coordinators of the table said it showed the gulf between a small number of elite UK universities and less prestigious institutions.

Laurent Dupasquier, managing partner at Emerging, a French human resources consultancy, said: ‘The top tier players, global brands (which tend to be all American and British), continue to lead, while other Anglo-Saxon universities, those that are mainly regional players, tend to fare less well, with an average of five places lost in comparison with last year.

‘Like the premier league, the champions have an international community of students and think internationally, unlike their more locally oriented counterparts.’

The table was compiled following a survey of 2,500 major recruiters in 20 countries.

Employers were asked to rank universities against a range of criteria including their production of graduates who are ready to work and their links with business.

The study claimed that ‘the days of ivory towers are over’.

Graduates ‘should be firmly planted in their field of expertise as a result of practical training and internships’, it said.
