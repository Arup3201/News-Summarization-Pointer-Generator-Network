It was a transfer that added gloss to Aston Villa’s summer business. Tom Cleverley, signed initially on loan from Manchester United following a tumultuous deadline day, brought 13 England caps and one Premier League winners’ medal to a club shorn of success in recent years.

A good move for the player, who wanted to escape the ‘negativity’ of Old Trafford, as well as both clubs concerned. Yet that spark has yet to ignite on Cleverley’s career in Birmingham, and the defeat at Queens Park Rangers on Monday night was an opportunity missed.

His statistics from the 2-0 loss are actually fairly positive. He misplaced just seven of his 65 passes to record a success rate of 89 per cent, higher than any of his team-mates, excluding Gabriel Agbonlahor who completed only 18 passes.

He struck a sweet volley through a mass of bodies that Rob Green did well to keep out late on too.

But that drive forward to start and finish attacking plays was missing. When your star striker is still shaking off the effects of six months spent on the sidelines through a ruptured achilles it shows.

As Cleverley’s touch map shows, he was busy but rarely did he get involved at the sharp end. Only once did he touch the ball in the box, and he tried just three passes into the 18-yard area. Two failed.

When he was unveiled to the press at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training ground, he spoke about hitting both boxes and being the most advanced of a midfield trio.

Manager Paul Lambert asked Cleverley to play on the left of those on Monday night, with Carlos Sanchez holding and Ashley Westwood right.

Tactics heavily influence where a player makes an impact of course, but the dynamism desperately needed by Villa was lacking.

Those of us who remember the impact Cleverley made in the 2011 Community Shield know he has it within him to affect and create where it matters. He played two first-time passes, including the key assist to unlock Manchester City’s defence for Nani’s equaliser, in a fast-flowing move around the area.

There was also the 8-2 win over Arsenal where he looked a player who had found himself following successful loan spells at Leicester, Watford and Wigan.

The promise never quite materialised but it is worth noting that even while getting pilloried last season he made 35 appearances for club and country.

The campaign before, Sir Alex Ferguson started him against Real Madrid in a match (and tie) United were winning until Nani got a straight red card. The Madrid midfield that night contained Xabi Alonso, Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira.

That could not have been blind faith from Ferguson, the most successful British manager in history, in a game he was desperate to win; this United academy graduate can play and fulfill instructions.

Against Liverpool he came straight into the Villa team and helped carry out Lambert’s defensive plans to a tee. Brendan Rodgers’ team were pressed tight in central areas and suffocated from inflicting their usual attacking verve.

That result bears contextualising with Liverpool’s recent struggles to break down defences, notably Hull last weekend. Nevertheless, Cleverley can do the dirty stuff when asked.

Subsequent losses against Arsenal, Chelsea, City, and Everton saw that initial glow fade, although he has already created eight chances, compared to 10 in the whole of last season.

That is what Villa, a side without a goal in more than eight hours, need from him now: vibrancy in the final third. He may never return to United, but this is his chance, at 25, to show he can still be a very good Premier League player.
