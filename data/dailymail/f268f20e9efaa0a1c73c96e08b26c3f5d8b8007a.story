Over half of British men admit to trying to influence their partner’s fashion choices, according to the latest research.

And it isn't because they want to boost our style credentials, the majority of these men admit that their reason for doing so was so that other men wouldn’t look at their partner.

Respondents were initially asked whether or not they personally liked their partner’s fashion sense and the way they dressed, to which the majority (66 per cent) said that they did, whilst a third (34 per cent) said they did not.

When asked whether or not they had ever tried to influence the way their partner dressed, 51 per cent said that they had.

Those respondents who admitted that they did try to influence the way their partner dressed were asked to stipulate what situation would cause them to do so, to which a cheeky 71 per cent admitted that it was on nights out when their partner was without them.

While 55 per cent said it was during nights out when they were out together and 32 per cent admitted that it was when their partner was going off to work.

19 per cent of respondents claimed that they liked to voice their opinion on their partner’s dress sense ‘day-to-day’, while 11 per cent said it was during special occasions, like for weddings and birthdays.

When asked their reasons for interfering with their partner’s clothing choices, a third of men admitted it was to make sure that other men wouldn’t look at their partner, while 25 per cent said it was to make sure that she looked her best and 19 per cent said it was to help her spend less on clothes and other fashion accessories.

Even the ever-so-stylish Nicole Kidman has taken fashion advice from her husband and gone as far as to change her outfit based on his advice.

She told Grazia Daily: 'I tend to solicit [his] opinion. I’ve actually changed when my husband said something’s not great.

'A lot of times, I look in the mirror
and see something different. He likes natural and he likes something 
that’s “not so ‘done’ ”, which I would say speaks for a lot of men.

'I’ve definitely changed my style since I’ve been with him as well.'

When asked how they would try to influence the way their partner dressed, 88 per cent of men said it tended to be by dropping subtle hints, whilst 57 per cent said they would pick outfits from their partner’s wardrobe for them and 34 per cent said they would go shopping with their partner in order to influence their style choices.

But when it's the other way round, men weren't as willing to take style advice with 41 per cent saying they wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of fashion tips from their partner.

Mark Pearson, Chairman of MyVoucherCodes.co.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'We thought it would be interesting to ask men whether or not they give their partner fashion advice.

'The twist to the survey was whether or not men gave advice because they truly cared about how their partner looked or if they used it as a form of control.

Subtle approach: 34 per cent of men said they would go shopping with their partner in order to influence their style choices

'What was shocking about the results was how many men admitted that they tried to control their partner’s dress sense all because they were not comfortable with the idea of other men looking at their partner.'

He added: 'If you are with someone, you should accept them completely, and this includes their personal fashion style and choices.

If your partner wants to go out with her friends, then you should let her dress how she wants!'
