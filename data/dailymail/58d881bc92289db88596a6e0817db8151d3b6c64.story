Brazilian football hero Ronaldo is to move to Britain to become a student, it was revealed today.

The World Cup winner will come to live in London next month and plans to study advertising, according to Brazil's Veja magazine.

It is believed the former Real Madrid striker will stay for at least two years and take up a work placement with London-based communications company WPP, under the guidance of Sir Martin Sorrell.Â

Known as The Phenomenon in Brazil, Ronaldo has run his own sports marketing agency 9ine for the past two years.

The star, who has houses in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and a private island off the Rio coast, is also on the organising committees for the 2014 Brazil World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics.

His spokesman recently confirmed Ronaldo's plans to learn the tricks of the trade with WPP's founder Martin Sorrell.

He said: 'He intends to go to England, which he will receive advice and guidance from Mr Sorrell, who's the head of the world's largest advertising company.'

WPP is the world's largest communications services group, employing 162,000 people, in 3,000 offices in 110 countries.

Multi-millionaire Sir Martin built the business up after taking a stake in Wire and Plastic Products Plc in 1985 and transforming it into an international communications group.

The company moved its headquarters to Dublin in 2008 but announced last month that it will now pay its taxes in Britain from January 2 this year.

Ronaldo, 36, said in an interview that he could not wait to become a student again.

He told Brazil's Meio e Mensagem newspaper: 'Eighteen years have passed and I've hardly studied at all. I feel a great need to become a student again.

'I've learned a lot in life, travelling, living abroad, just in the school of life.

'But I also have to immerse myself in something. Learning from Martin Sorrell will be perfect.

'I won't leave him alone, I'll be asking him questions the whole day, just like a striker. He's going to have to tell me everything.'

Ronaldo, full name Ronaldo Nazario de Lima, retired from football last year after a glittering career.

In 2002, he won the World Cup for his country, scoring two goals in the final.
