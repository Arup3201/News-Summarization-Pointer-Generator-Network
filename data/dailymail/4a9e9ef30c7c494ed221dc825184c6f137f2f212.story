They say behind every strong man is a woman just as formidable.

And it appears Sir Winston Churchill was no exception to the rule, as a new exhibition has revealed how the world's leaders came to admire his wife Clementine and shower her with tokens of affection.

An exhibition of gifts given to the Churchill family are on display at their former home in Chartwell, Kent, including one sent from Charles de Gaulle to the former prime minister's wife near the end of the Second World War.

Among others are trinkets thanking her for her role in coordinating aid to Russia, a cut-glass fruit bowl from Stalin, and a collection of silverware from the town of Sheffield.

A spokesman for the National Trust said the display of 30 pieces reflects the strong influence had by Clementine Churchill over state and international business.

'She helped maintain difficult relationships and worked quietly behind the scenes for the war effort,' said Judith Evans, house and collections manager at the property.

'She made sure they dined with the right people and led by example in keeping domestic life going,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 

One such well-suited dinner guest was the
 former president of the French Republic, who sent a lalique crystal 
cockerel after an argument had over the Churchills' dinner table.

Among the gifts displayed at the family's former home in Chartwell, Kent, is a cigar box sent by the King Peter II of Yugoslavia

A cigar box with the former prime minister's portrait engraved on it was a gift from the 3rd Battalion 11th Sikh Regiment at Tehran

'When he went away, he felt very keenly that he had upset her and the cockerel is supposed to have been sent to appease her,' added Ms Evans.

A Viking Long Boat glass bowl with silver mounts was sent by Stalin after the Moscow Conference in 1944, while a brass brandy glass warmer a gift from Portugal.

A large series of maps was sent as a Christmas gift by President Roosevelt in 1945 and King Peter II of Yugoslavia gave the family a silyer cigar box made by Asprey of London in 1942.

Another cigar box with a portrait of Sir Winston on its front was sent as a 69th birthday gift from the 3rd Battalion 11th Sikh Regiment at Tehran.

The family also received countless parcels of food, thank you cards and several animals from well-wishers all over the world.

The couple knew how to keep good company, and frequently invited the 'right' people to dinner at their home

A lion, white kangaroo and black swans were recorded as being received as gifts, but were not kept at the house.

The exhibition called Gift of Power was opened by the couple's great-grandson Randolph Churchill and will be open to the public until February 23. 

The daughter of  Sir Henry and Lady Blanche Hozier, Clementine spent her childhood in London's Mayfair before being relocated with her family to Dieppe, France.

She was re-acquainted with Winston Churchill at a dinner party in 1908, after having met him four years earlier.

After months of correspondence, Churchill wrote to her mother requesting her hand in marriage.

On 12 September 1908, at St. Margaret's, Westminster, the pair married. Sir Winston was already a seasoned Parliamentarian before the couple had their five children.

During the war the well-educated Clementine organised canteens for munitions workers on behalf of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in the North East Metropolitan Area of London.

During World War II she was Chairman of the Red Cross Aid to Russia Fund, the President of the Young Women's Christian Association War Time Appeal and the Chairman of Fulmer Chase Maternity Hospital for Wives of Junior Officers.

The Clementine Churchill Hospital in Harrow, Middlesex is named after her.

In 1946 she was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, becoming Dame Clementine Churchill GBE.

Later, she was awarded honorary degrees by the University of Glasgow and the University of Oxford and later, in 1976, by the University of Bristol.

In May 1965, she was created a life peer as Baroness Spencer-Churchill, of Chartwell in the County of Kent.

She sat as a cross-bencher, but her growing deafness precluded her taking a regular part in parliamentary life.

Lady Spencer-Churchill died in Princes Gate, Knightsbridge, London of a heart attack on 12 December 1977.

She was 92 years old and had outlived her husband by almost 13 years.
