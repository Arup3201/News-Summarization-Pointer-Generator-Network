'Walter Mitty': David Stanton, 67, admitted stealing nearly £250,000 from his mother-in-law

A conman who stole nearly £250,000 from his frail deaf and blind mother-in-law to fund a luxury lifestyle, was today jailed for three years.

David Stanton, 68, used money that should have been paying for Fanny Epps' nursing home bills to prop up his struggling business and buy top-of-the range cars and expensive holidays.

Mrs Epps, the mother of Stanton's wife Ruth, died in March 2010 at the age of 94.

Stanton, of Budleigh Salterton, Devon, admitting stealing £245,209.25p from Mrs Epps between November 2002 and February 2004.

The conman,
who has oxygen tubes to help him breathe, also admitted converting 
criminal property by funding the purchase of a £45,000 BMW 7 series car.

Stanton got his hands on Mrs Epps money after she had a fall at home and it was decided she needed to move into a care home.

He was handed control of her affairs and sold her house.

But instead of using the money to pay nursing home bills, he kept it for himself.

Defence lawyer Lee Bremridge argued that Stanton had actually been paying for his mother-in-law's care and that the amount stolen was £127,600 and not £245,000.

But prosecutor Sean Brunton said money was still owed to the nursing home and that there will be a Proceeds of Crime investigation.

Stanton's wife of 29 years revealed she has been left 
destitute by his life of lies and compared
her ex-husband to Walter Mitty - a fictional ineffective character with
a vivid fantasy life in James Thurber's short story The Secret Life of 
Walter Mitty.

She even accused him of deliberately losing weight to back up his false claim that he was dying of cancer.

Mrs Stanton said: 'I am now 68 and living in a one 
bedroom flat. I am now working 12 hour shifts in a nursing home as a 
care assistant to pay my rent.'

'I found out that he wasn’t paying any bills, not even on my car insurance. And of course we still owe thousands in fees for my mother’s care. My mother ended up staying in a tiny little room in a nursing home funded by social services. She died aged 94 and I don’t know if she had any idea about all this.

'I took him to court for some closure for my mother.

'He even auctioned furniture from our home where he had a safe. I ended up with just a few personal effects from my first husband who had died a long time ago.

'He is a Walter Mitty. Who knows if he has any money left, who knows if there was another woman.

'When he said he had cancer he deliberately lost weight. But then he later admitted that was not true. He is the most amazing conman.'

'My mother had had a fall when she 
lived in London. We had to sell her house to pay for her care down in 
Devon. David had the Power of Attorney to sell her house.

'He said he had invested it in the money markets and that would pay for her to stay in the nursing home.'

'That’s how it went on, we all 
thought he had done what he said he had done. But when I left him I 
discovered there was no money. It had all gone along with our business.

'We had six mobility shops around the Westcountry and he had used some of the money to do this.

'But he was just spending, spending, 
spending. We were having a very good life, a high life of a round the 
world trip to Australia, driving BMW cars and an MG sports car and 
living in a beautiful house. He was spending money we did not have.

'He said on paper we were millionaires.'

The plundered estate should have been 
left to Mrs Epps two daughters - Ruth and Sandra - and
her son, record producer and engineer Stewart Epps, who has worked with 
Elton John, Robbie Williams, Oasis, Led Zeppelin, Paul Weller, Bill 
Wyman, George Harrison and Jimmy Page.

Speaking after her husband was sentenced today, Mrs Stanton said: 'I feel as least some justice for my 
mother. If I had had my way it would have gone to trial. I had a lot 
more to say, I also wanted justice for my children. But I did not get 
the opportunity because he pleaded guilty.

'He said he only has 12 months to 
live but there is no medical evidence of that. He has played on that 
lots of times in the past.

'He even took out a mortgage in the 
name of my handicapped son. So hopefully they feel some justice has been
done for them as well as my mother.'
