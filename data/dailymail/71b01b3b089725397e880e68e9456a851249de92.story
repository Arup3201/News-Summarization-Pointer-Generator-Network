New South Wales state premier Mike Baird says a planned state funeral for Phillip Hughes has been called off.

Hughes died aged 25 on November 27, two days after being struck by a short-pitched ball from Sean Abbott during a domestic first class match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

More than 5,000 people, including former Australia team-mates and players from around the world, attended a funeral service in Hughes' hometown of Macksville, New South Wales last Wednesday.

Tributes continued to be laid out for fallen cricket star Phillip Hughes at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday

Baird said on Monday the planned state ceremony had been cancelled after consultation with Hughes' family and Cricket Australia.

'All parties felt that given the enormous outpouring of support at last Wednesday's funeral, that a State Memorial Service would no longer need to be held,' Baird said in a statement.

Hughes has been named the honorary '13th man' for what is expected to be an emotion-charged first test between Australia and India at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.

Fast bowler Mitchell Johnson said Hughes' death would be in the minds of all players.

'It's going to be an emotional morning ... for me going out there bowling, the first spell might be the most difficult,' Johnson said.

Cricket Australia said spectators at the Adelaide Oval will be asked to stand for 63 seconds of applause before the match begins.

Hughes was 63 not out when he was struck by a short-pitched delivery in Sydney last month.

The Australian players will also wear Hughes' test cap No 408 on their shirts.
