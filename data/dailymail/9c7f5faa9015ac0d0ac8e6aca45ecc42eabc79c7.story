A Team GB skier is applying for a restraining order against a friend’s violent ex-boyfriend whose abuse left her too scared to go jogging.

Mark Laidler told Amanda Lightfoot, who competed in the biathlon at this year's Winter Olympics, that he would 'drag her out by the hair' after she stepped in to stop his partner being attacked.

The athlete, 27, told magistrates she was nervous to train in the wake of 36-year-old Laidler's thuggish behaviour, which included hitting his then-partner on the head.

Assault: British Olympic skier Amanda Lightfoot, 27, has spoken out after intervening to help a friend who was being assaulted by her ex-partner. He also threatened to drag the biathlete out of a room by her hair

The assault happened after Ms Lightfoot became embroiled in a domestic row between her friend Hayley Clare, and Ms Clare's then-partner Laidler.

He first struck Ms Clare across the head several times after she returned from a night out in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in April.

She retreated to the spare bedroom of their shared home in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, where she texted the athlete and told her what happened.

She was treated in hospital for swelling and neck pain, and South Tyneside magistrates heard the concerned athlete visited her friend's home the next day to give her support.

Abuse: Mark Laidler, 36, pleaded guilty to two assaults on his ex-partner and one on the skier

When she arrived, Laidler kicked a table at his then-partner and hit her on the right arm.

He then told Amanda: 'You’d better shut up or I’ll drag you out by the hair'.

Laidler admitted two charges of assault against his former lover and a common assault on the Olympic athlete, believed to refer to his threats.

The court heard Ms Lightfoot is now seeking a restraining order  because she regularly goes jogging near her home and was afraid Laidler would approach her.

In Sochi Ms Lightfoot became the first female British Olympian in eight years to compete in the biathlon, a gruelling sport which combines cross-country skiing and shooting.

In her victim statement to the court, she said: 'When he told me he was going to drag me out by the hair I was terrified he was going to hit me.

'I was shocked at how the defendant was treating my friend and I was shaking but tried to stay calm because Hayley was so distressed.' 

Christopher Brown, defending, said: 'This relationship was in a nose-dive situation and the tension had been building up.

'My client accepts that he acted in a manner of which he is thoroughly ashamed.'

Laidler is due to be sentenced on August 28, when applications for restraining orders will be made.

Speaking outside court, Ms Lightfoot said: 'We’re really pleased he pleaded guilty in the end and he accepted what he did was wrong.

'Hopefully we can put an end to this all now and Hayley can start the next chapter of her life.'

Her friend Ms Clare added: 'I am so glad this is all over and done with. I just feel I have wasted three years of my life with this person.

'The court proceedings have been awful, but I am glad I went through with it.

Rapid rise: Ms Lightfoot only took up skiing at 19 but has already competed in the Winter Olympics in Sochi

'I am upset by the way and which I have been treated by him, but I have wonderful friends and family and I just want to get on with my life now.'

Ms Lightfoot, from South Shields, South Tyneside, contested the 7.5km sprint in Russia earlier this year.

The athlete - who has enjoyed a rapid raise after she took up skiing at the age of 19 - placed 71st in the 15km individual event after missing targets on the shooting range.

But she was upbeat about her performance, saying she had plenty of experiences to improve her performance for the next Winter Olympics in 2018.
