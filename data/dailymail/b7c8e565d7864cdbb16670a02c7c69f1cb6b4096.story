A nurse who was diagnosed with Ebola has asked the bridal shop that was forced to close for weeks after her visit for a $480 refund on her bridesmaid dresses. 

Amber Vinson, who has since recovered, was working in Dallas, Texas when she contracted the disease but - unaware she had it - she traveled to Cleveland, Ohio to plan her wedding.

She went to Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal in Akron with her bridesmaids and put in an order - but her visit later forced the shop to close for weeks, losing the owners tens of thousands of dollars.

Her attorney has now asked that the shop refund her bridesmaids the $479.89 they paid for their dresses, the Akron Beacon Journal reported. 

Demands: Amber Vinson, a nurse who was diagnosed with Ebola in Texas last month, has asked for a bridal shop to give her a refund - even though her visit cost the shop tens of thousands of dollars

Attorney Stephen Malouf said Vinson saw the publicity of her case harm the store and decided to get bridesmaids' dresses elsewhere to avoid further scrutiny for the business.

But owner Anna Younker said Vinson's change of heart and the refund request feel like 'a slap in the face' after the shop lost tens of thousands of dollars because of its connection to her.

'This is like the icing on the cake for her to ask,' she told the Beacon Journal. 'By canceling completely because she wants to go somewhere else, that's like a slap in the face to me.'

Malouf said that wasn't Vinson's intention.

'I'm sorry that the shop is upset,' he said. 'This was an effort to help the shop and Amber. ... This was a purely innocent request and I'm sorry it wasn't received in the spirit in which it was sent.'

Younker said she occasionally makes exceptions to her store's usual policy against refunds, but that it's not feasible in this case.

'It doesn't make sense,' Younker said. 'I'm out a lot of money.'

She said if Vinson had called her and explained why they wanted to go elsewhere, she might have considered helping her, but she said she has not heard from the bride-to-be.

Vinson was the second nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to be diagnosed with Ebola after they both cared for Thomas Eric Duncan, who later died of the disease.

After treating him, she flew to Ohio to prepare for her upcoming wedding to former football player Derrick Markray.

While in Ohio, she learned that one of her colleagues, Nina Pham, had been diagnosed with Ebola - so she called Texas Health before boarding her return flight and was cleared to travel, she said.

It was only once she landed back in Dallas after the weekend trip that she discovered that she had a temperature of 100.3F and reported to the hospital.

Since she was hospitalized, a gofundme page has raised more than $23,000 for her. 

Vinson's  diagnosis led to several weeks of health monitoring for more than 160 people in Ohio - including people who had been at the bridal shop. None showed symptoms.

At the height of the watch period, more than 160 Ohio residents — including customers who visited the bridal shop at the same time — were monitored by public health officials for symptoms.
