With the nation edging towards an obesity epidemic, some health professionals are resorting to shock tactics in an attempt to convince people to eat healthier.

One government health agency in California set out to warn of the dangers of sugary drinks by reaching out to parents and educating them about proper nutrition.

However some have suggested this time the agency First 5, went too far by using Photoshop to make a perfectly healthy child look obese.

Supersize me: The image on the left is an original photo of the little girl on First 5's website. The image is on the right is what appears on posters around California

Although the intentions to 'nurture and protect our most precious resource — our children' were noble, the poster is now on display all over the state of California and drawing criticism from many quarters.

The two were placed side by side by author Marilyn Wann, who wrote the book 'FAT!SO? : Because You Don’t Have to Apologize for Your Size' - she believes in a Health at Every Size approach.

Wann placed the two photos on her Facebook demanding 'children deserve to be protected from this kind of damaging fearmongering. (And from creepy Photoshopping!).'

'It was so mindblowingly hateful that I Photoshopped them together and posted them on Facebook and on Tumblr,' Wann said.

Obesity epidemic: Nationally, some 15 percent of children are overweight or obese, as are some 60 percent of adults

Opinions: Health officials say the use of shocking pictures does not work whilst ad agencies like First 5 tend to veer towards impactful images

Divisive: Whilst a picture of an obese child may suit an ad agency looking to get a message across, health officials say such shock tactics have no impact in reality

'Hate messages are bad for public health. Children of all sizes deserve to be valued as they are and supported in eating and exercising, because these behaviors are fun, feel good, and are good for health. No shame or blame!'

The ad-agency, First 5 has refused to apologise for the doctoring of the photos. Although the agency has worked on anti-obesity campaigns for years, this is the first time the program has Photoshopped images of kids to make them appear bigger than they normally are.

The aim of the campaign is to fight childhood obesity using the image of a chubby little girl drinking a bag of sugar through a straw.

The caption reads: 'Sugary drinks like juice, sports drinks and soda can cause obesity. Choose milk and water instead.'

'The ad was intended to show parents the real-life consequences of obesity and what sugar can do to our children’s lives,' said spokeswoman Lindsay Van Laningham.

'They are just stock images which were Photoshopped,' she said. 'When you are handing a child soda or a juice box to drink you might as well be handing them a packet of sugar. Because that's what happening.'

Such Photoshop manipulation occurs despite experts continually pointing out that using images of overweight kids is ineffective.

Childhood obesity prevention researcher Marsha Davis said making people feel badly about their weight does not lead to change. 'We need to fight obesity... not obese people,' she said.
