Dolce & Gabbana brought summer straight to the catwalk in Milan yesterday with their Sicilian chic collection which incorporated the rich and vibrant Italian culture.

To set the scene, cactuses in pots lined the end of the catwalk as the models paraded against a rustic green wall in stripey and colourful garments perfect for a lazy summer day in the city.

Entitled Sea, Sun and Love, the new line encapsulated Sicilian culture with puppet-inspired glistening chandelier earrings, head-shaped ceramic vases from Caltagirone and floral heels as well as the odd colourful pom-pom brightening up the season's flat sandal shoes.

It was a summery colour splash on the Dolce & Gabbana catwalk yesterday in Milan

An 86-strong pack of model took to the catwalk to show off the striped collection against a backdrop reminiscent of a summer in Sicily

The star of the show was a basket-shaped skirt which was inspired by those traditionally used in the farming community to collect and transport fruit, but given a chic and stylish new look, of course.

An emerging trend was most definitely the use of the basket to construct corsets and skirts alike with an occasional hint of lace as well as stark stripes in red, white and monochrome.

Symbolising a glamorous holiday in the Italian sun, designs featured gorgeous prints of lemons, maps and Sicilian folk art.

In true Dolce & Gabbanna style, the show closed to loud applause as a pack of eighty-six models in 86 different 
patterned scarves took to the catwalk.

The collection was a perfect reflection of the brand's newest shop in the Italian capital of Milan.

Far different from London's flagship interactive Burberry store, the Dolce & Gabanna store is retro and authentic with furniture sourced from flea markets and antiques galore.
