A photographer has been accused of glamourising sex attacks after releasing a fashion shoot that bears chilling similarities to the gang rape of an Indian woman on a bus.

Raj Shetye's images entitled The Wrong Turn show a distressed woman in high-end clothing fending off male models on a bus.

In one of the pictures, a model holds her down on a row of seats while another appears to be kissing her on the leg.

The images have provoked outrage online 
with critics claiming Mr Shetye had based the shoot on the gang rape of a student in Delhi in December 2012 which led to widespread protests across the world and forced India to confront its culture of violence against women.

'Disgusting': This image is one of a series of pictures by Indian fashion photographer Raj Shetye which critics say have been inspired by infamous gang rape of a woman on a bus in Delhi in December 2012

Four men were sentenced to death in September last year over the attack, referred to as Nirbhaya, a Hindi word for 'fearless' which is now used as a pseudonym for the victim.

Saniya Scott ‏tweeted: 'Heard about #Nirbhaya inspired modeling photo-shoot. Could anything be more demeaning? Wasn't right in ANY sense. Inspiration is no excuse.'

Priya ‏@pliyaaa said: 'Sickened to my very core! Just how someone can think of glamorizing a heinous act like rape is beyond me.'

Sufiya Ahmed added: 'Disgusting fashion shoot glamorising rape in India. Now rapists will think they are fashionable studs.'

'A way of throwing light on the issue': Mr Shetye denied the shoot was inspired by the Delhi bus attack but said he wanted highlight the dangers for women in a way that he knew how

Outrage: Critics took to Twitter to express their disgust at the photo shoot

Mr Shetye, who is Indian, issued a robust defence of his project and attacked his critics for misinterpreting his attempt to highlight the dangers facing women in India.

In a statement to MailOnline, he said: 'In today's times when freedom of speech and expression is ripped off from a person merely through social media, it is a plight for an artist to keep his work in perspective and independent of public opinion.

'It's unfortunate that I am compelled to justify my artistic expression of a social issue just as many artists (big and small) have had to do in the past. I still strongly stand by work.'

Mr Shetye denied trying to replicate the Nirbhaya attack but said his aim was to focus on the plight of the poor who are often forced to take public transport.

He added: 'Being a part of society, it breaks my heart to see my mother, my friends, my sister constraining themselves professionally and personally just to be safe.

'It's an imbalanced society where the rich can afford the luxury and safety attached to driving in their own vehicle, but the majority of women still commute on buses, autos and trains.

'I believe that I have managed to achieve my goal of starting dialogue on these issues. If the cost to set the ball rolling is that I have to be the bad guy here, be it that way.'

He said he does not intend to profit from the project, adding: 'The intent of this shoot is not commercial gain.

'The aim is purely to create art that will garner public opinion about issues that concern women.'

None of the top designers which supplied the clothes have been credited publicly, he added.

Mr Shetye later took the images down from his official website.

The Delhi bus gang rape was one of the most high-profile cases to hit India in recent years in a country where rape offences are reported every 21 minutes on average.

More recently, it emerged last month that a 14-year-old girl was dragged into a forest and raped on the orders of a village council in remote eastern India in retaliation for a sex assault blamed on her brother.

Earlier this year, two teenage girls were allegedly raped before they were found swinging from a mango tree in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

The new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised a zero tolerance approach on crimes against women, but violence and discrimination against women in remain deeply entrenched in society.
