Wearing a knitted V-neck jumper, her grey hair arranged in neat curls, she is hardly the likeliest of university students.

Yet this bespectacled 58-year-old is Maeve Weber, a student at The School of Oriental and African Studies.

And yesterday she became the surprise star of University Challenge after appearing on the BBC2 programme on Monday night and helped turn the show into the most watched programme on the channel.

Starter for ten: SOAS student Maeve Weber helped her team to a victorious 240 points versus Reading's 90

Taking part in the quiz show, which is hosted by Jeremy Paxman, Mrs Weber helped her four-strong team secure a place in the quarter final by answering general and specific knowledge questions.

Admittedly she did not get quite as many correct as some of her fellow team members.

But that detail appeared not to matter to many of the programme’s 3.13million, who instead fixated by her appearance.

Fans of the show celebrated having a ‘granny’ on the programme - despite Mrs Weber having no grandchildren, while  marvelling at her hair.

And one wrote on Twitter: ‘Is Weber the sweetest old lady of all time on University Challenge?’

Another posted: ‘Utterly in awe of Weber’s hair,’ while a third appeared to gleefully state: ‘there is actually a granny on University Challenge.’

Mrs Weber, who lives in Hertfordshire with her husband of 35 years, Andrew, 66, has two children - Eleanor and Robin - both of whom have grown up and left home.

And no doubt her empty nest will have played some part in Mrs Weber’s decision to enrol at SOAS, where she is reading for a Bachelor of Arts degree in Ancient Near Eastern Studies.

To anyone watching University Challenger, which was aired at 8pm on Monday night, it will have been clear that Mrs Weber was the eldest - as well as the only female - on her team.

Success: The episode, presented as ever by Jeremy Paxman, was the most watched BBC2 show on Monday

Yet the other contestants were also older than might be expected of university students and the SOAS team had an average age of 34.

Their rivals, from Reading University, had an average age of 26.

Reading scored 90 points, while SOAS won 240, securing themselves a place in the quarter final.

Last night a spokesperson for BBC2 said the channel was unable to comment on the ages of University Challenge contestants due to data protection guidelines.

She added that the episode was the most watched programme on the channel for Monday.
