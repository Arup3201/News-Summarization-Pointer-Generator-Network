An Iraqi refugee who made ‘dubious’ claims about having cancer, falling and injuring himself, and his father dying so he could continue to receive disability welfare while overseas finally came unstuck when the Department of Social Services refused to believe he’d received death threats from Iraqi insurgents.

Ali Mahmood, who has a degree in chemical engineering but has never worked in Australia, first legitimately claimed Disability Support Pension - which can be $800 a month - for his spinal scoliosis in 2003 when he arrived in the country on a humanitarian visa.

However, over the past decade Mr Mahmood left Australia to visit Iraq on four separate occasions –remaining outside of Australia for longer than the 13-weeks allowed in order to still receive DSP.

Each time he sought extensions to his ‘portability period’ with excuses such as his father had died (it later turned out to be his divorced wife’s father) and that he had cancer, which there is no medical record of.

Ali Mahmood's appeal to keep his disability welfare has been rejected after a tribunal concluded he did not have any evidence to prove his life was threatened in Iraq that stopped him from returning to Australia 

It wasn’t until his final trip to Iraq, on 30 November 2012, that the 54-year-old came unstuck for his absences when the Sunni Muslim claimed his life was in danger from Shia Muslims in his home country.

Mr Mahmood did not notify Centrelink that he was going overseas this time and after email correspondence - where he asked to be allowed to still claim - Centrelink refused the request and decided that the DSP should be cancelled from 1 March 2013.

His Family Tax Benefit (FTB) instalments were also cancelled as of 22 March 2013 after he failed to provide an estimate of his income.

After the Social Security Appeals Tribunal agreed to stop his payments on the recommendation of Centrelink, a determined Mr Mahmood took his case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Residence in Australia is a pre-condition for receipt of a DSP.

If recipients go overseas they are required to notify Centrelink in advance. There is a 13-week portability period - the period you can still claim while overseas - for DSP.

He arrived back in Australia on 1 March 2014 and claimed he was unable to leave Baghdad before because of death and kidnapping threats made by insurgents.

Senior Tribunal Member D Letcher QC said in an Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in Adelaide on October 24, that he ‘did not accept the applicant’s account for a number of reasons’.

The reasons included the fact Mr Mahmood made no contact with the Australian embassy in Baghdad ‘and resisted all efforts to have him contact it. I infer that this was because he knew that any embassy enquiry would show he was not under any threat’.

The judgement went on: ‘The applicant has a history of overstaying his absences and seeking extensions of the portability period for dubious reasons and, having regard to all the evidence before me, I consider that this is what occurred on this occasion.’

Mr Letcher said there was ‘no independent corroboration’ and that ‘the applicant was a very unsatisfactory witness, being evasive, contradictory and inconsistent in his demeanour and responses to questions’.

Mr Mahmood refused to attend the hearing in person for cross-examination.

‘I do not accept that he received any threat to his life or well-being in Baghdad,’ Mr Letcher concluded.

In the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the full list of outrageous claims Mr Mahmood made to the Department of Social Services over ten years to try and keep his welfare payments while overseas were also revealed.

In 2007, he claimed he left Australia because his dad was very ill and died two days after he arrived.

‘At the hearing, the applicant (having given evidence that his father was alive in 2012) said that the deceased in 2007 was his wife’s father. I note that the applicant and his wife separated in 2006, were divorced on 23 January 2007, and the applicant professed to know nothing of his wife’s whereabouts or activities “for the last 8 years”,’ Mr Letcher said.

During the 2008 trip, he claimed that he had fallen and hurt himself, and was granted another extension.

On 23 February 2010, he advised that he had been diagnosed with cancer and was receiving chemotherapy.

Extensions to his portability period were granted until April, and then June and, finally, August 2010.

His further application for an extension on 30 August 2010 was refused because he did not provide any current treatment information.

He appealed that decision to the SSAT but was unsuccessful.

‘In evidence to this Tribunal, the applicant said that his abdominal cancer had been diagnosed on biopsy in Damascus and chemotherapy commenced.

‘Later, he consulted doctors in Jordan and was told that it had all been a mistake and he had no cancer. He did not bring back to Australia any hospital or medical reports, x-rays or pathology results,’ Mr Letcher revealed.
