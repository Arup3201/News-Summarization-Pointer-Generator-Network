Texas Senator Ted Cruz previewed the likely 2016 Republican presidential attacks on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday, slamming the presumptive Democratic nominee as 'consistently wrong on domestic policy and foreign policy.'

And he lambasted her for clinging to a health insurance overhaul proposal when her husband Bill Clinton was president, saying '"Hillarycare" ... would have been every bit as disastrous' as he believes the Affordable Care Act has become.

Mainstream media outlets have 'already moved her into the White House,' he complained of Clinton, who was also a U.S. Senator before moving to the State Department, during an interview at a Washington, D.C. breakfast event.

But most of his ire was reserved for Mrs. Clinton's stewardship of U.S. foreign policy.

Ted Cruz tore into Hillary Clinton during a breakfast event at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., in a possible preview to the 2016 presidential slugfest

Cruz said Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, presided over 'disastrous' foreign policy, but still has a 40 per cent chance to be elected president

'When you look at the foreign policy disaster that is Obama,' said Cruz, 'a great deal of that lands on her doorstep, and she was directly responsible for it.'

'The president's foreign policy has been an absolute debacle … alienating allies and cozying up to enemies,' Cruz told a capacity-crowd audience at the Newseum, a short distance from the U.S. Capitol.

And he alleged that the State Department and the White House 'are repeating the mistakes [of North Korea] with Iran.'

'The degree of religious fanaticism with the willingness to sacrifice life makes the prospect of a nuclear Iran extraordinarily dangerous,' Cruz said, in a moment that sounded like a line from a presidential stump speech.

President Obama has seen a stunning plunge in Americans' perception of his influence abroad, with 53 per cent telling Gallup pollsters this month that they don't think other world leaders respect him.

The debacle in Benghazi, Libya, where armed terrorists attacked and razed U.S. diplomatic outposts following the State Department's refusal to provide more security, is a continuing embarrassment that the White House avoids discussing at every turn.

U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens perished in the attack, along with three security personnel.

Asked for a one-word response to the name 'Barack Obama,' Cruz responded with a riff on a Bushism -- 'Non-strategery' -- then changed his answer  to 'imperial'

'Disaster': Obama's White House has struggled with Iranian and Syrian crises, with Republicans saying Syrian president Bashar al-Assad (R) and Iranian leaders like  parliamentary national security chief Alaeddin Boroujerdi (L), are openly defying U.S. ultimatums

And America's standing with Russia and other countries that previous administrations had held at bay has deteriorated since Obama became president, in the wake of a hands-off strategy that Republicans say has emboldened President Vladimir Putin and other adversarial leaders.

Yesterday a Russian warship docked in Havana, Cuba, drawing comparisons to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the epic standoff between the Kennedy White House and the Soviet Union, modern Russia's anti-America predecessor.

Cruz has been the Senate's most outspoken opponent of the Affordable Care Act, last year staging a nearly day-long quasi-filibuster in an attempt to leverage a threatened government shutdown to force changes to Obamacare.

He suggested Thursday that a second Clinton presidency would deepen the health insurance overhaul's problems.

Clinton's 1994 'Hillarycare' proposals, he said, 'would have been every bit as disastrous' as the currently dysfunctional Obamacare program.

And arguing for continued Republican leadership in Congress, he charged that 'it was only because of House Republicans that Obamacare was stopped from being the same disaster as Hillarycare.'

Cruz said Clinton has a '40 per cent chance' of becoming president in 2016, and that she will likely be the Democratic nominee if she runs.

National Journal declared Kentucky Senator Rand Paul the GOP's 'leader of the pack' on Wednesday.

Cruz resisted the temptation to put distance between himself and his presumed rival, however.

'I think Rand Paul is terrific,' he told interviewer Mike Allen, Politico's chief White Hosue correspondent, calling him 'an important voice for liberty in the party, and helping to bring Republicans back to the principles we should be standing for.'

Asked about his Democratic opponents – 'What do the Mean Girls of the Senate do?'  – Cruz leveled a quip meant for Allen's bosses.

'They leak stories to Politico,' he said.
