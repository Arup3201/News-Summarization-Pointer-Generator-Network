More than a year after George Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges for killing unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, he and his family still live in a state of  secrecy paranoia - believing their lives are in constant danger. 

A new interview with the Zimmermans reveals that the family is still reeling from the intense national attention that focused on George after he shot 17-year-old Martin and claimed self defense. 

George's brother Robert to GQ magazine that the family is still holed up in a secluded house in central Florida. They learned CIA tactics from watching the Ben Affleck film 'Argo,' and Secret Service-style threat identification from a documentary about the assassination attempt against President Ronald Reagan. 

The family also has a color-coded threat system they used at the house: Code Blue means police are at the door, Code Brown means 'draw your weapons.' Code Black: 'Come out guns blazing.'

CNN agreed to put George Zimmerman and his brother up in the Ritz-Carlton for an interview. But when the $3,600 bill came through, a producer for the network intially refused to pay and called them 'evil,' Robert Zimmerman Jr. caims

Robert, who believes his 30-year-old brother is suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, has also come up with a number of get-rich-quick schemes over the past two years.

His ultimate aim was reportedly to capitalize on Zimmerman's notoriety by turning him into a reality TV star - like other celebrities have done in the past. 

He cited John Walsh, who began hosting America's Most Wanted after his young son was abducted and killed, and Kim Kardashian, whose leaked sex tape propelled her to fame, as examples.

'I learn a lot from "Keeping up with the Kardashians,"' Robert told GQ. 

Robert also had an idea for a security company - Z Security Products, that would sell branded home security devices including the Z Bar, the Z Rock and the Z Light. The latter is a flashlight designed by George that had an alarm that would shout 'Help me! Help me!'

'They're all targeted at women,' Robert said.  

George Zimmerman and his brother, Robert, were also accused of being ‘evil’ after they ran up a $3,600 hotel tab while staying at the Ritz-Carlton on the tab of CNN.

Prior to George Zimmerman’s 2013 acquittal on second degree murder charges related to the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon, the news network had agreed to fund the brothers stay at the hotel in Miami in exchange for an exclusive interview.

But then a CNN producer accused the Zimmerman brothers of shamelessly taking advantage of their offer to pay for two hotel rooms for three nights and ‘everything’ else they needed.

At the end of their stay, CNN was given a $3,600 tab that included a large room service bill, spa treatments and ‘swag’ from the gift shop, according to GQ.

When the bill was sent to a CNN producer, he reportedly told Robert Zimmerman, ‘You and your brother are evil!’

The brothers stand accused of emptying minibars, getting their clothes laundered, making several trips to the spa, treating a party of ten to dinner at the hotel restaurant, and even buying good – including bracelets and bath fizzies – from the hotel gift shop.

The hotel manager threatened to call the police, until CNN eventually agreed to settle the large bill.

Robert Zimmerman was reportedly so upset over the incident that he retired to his room shaking after his conversation with the CNN producer.

‘He wrapped all the blankets around him, ordered shrimp, chain-smoked cigarettes, got roaring drunk. Nothing helped. He called his mother in a panic. “I can’t get warm,” he sobbed. “I just can’t get warm,”’ according to the GQ profile.

Next an inconsolable Robert attempted to call Dr Drew, the TV doctor, who he had met when he had appeared on Drew’s TV show shortly before his brother’s trial.

Dr. Drew wasn’t available, but fortunately a producer for the show was able to talk Robert down from his frenzy.

The next morning he returned the only purchases he could to the hotel store, namely a bottle of Mercedes-Benz cologne and a Ritz-Carlton wallet that his brother had bought him to say thanks.

Zimmerman's parents, Gladys and Bob, and younger brother Robert spoke to GQ about their new life with the killer, who was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter last summer.

The family, who describe themselves as 'victims', said they already owned at least ten guns before Zimmerman  shot to death the unarmed 17-year-old on February 26, 2012.

But they said as soon as his younger sister Grace saw the news report on her phone, she screamed, 'We need to get guns!', before buying a new Taurus pistol.

As  violent threats flooded in and a $10,000 bounty was placed for Zimmerman's 'citizen's arrest', the family then decided they could no longer stay put.

Zimmerman, who was not charged with murder until six weeks after the shooting, and his then-wife Shellie went to stay with a federal air marshal friend, while the rest of the family fled to Florida.

Free man? George Zimmerman said he still lives in fear that he will be assassinated and has racked up a $2.5million debt from his legal bills

Robert, who bears a strong resemblance to his brother, was living in suburban Washington D.C. at the time and was seen as especially vulnerable.

Following the shooting, a special agent from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement reportedly told him he had been identified as a target, saying: 'You need to go, and you need to go now.'  

The family still live in a safe house in central Florida, where they rarely go out or see Zimmerman, fearing an attack from the public as payback for Mr Martin's killing.

'I am sure there are people, you know, some young kid that has nothing going for him, but he's able to get a pistol, wants to make a name for himself,' Bob, who often sleeps with a gun, told GQ.

'Maybe I'll kill one of the Zimmermans. Maybe George, maybe one of his family members. I'll be famous.' You know? That happens. And that's what worries me.' 

As well as living in fear, the family are reportedly battling financial issues, having spent around $35,000 on hotel rooms and safe houses, and Zimmerman owing $2.5million in legal fees.

Victim: Trayvon Martin was shot by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch coordinator, on February 26, 2012

Due to his notoriety, Zimmerman remains unemployed and reluctant to find a job, according to the magazine article, which is published in GQ's October edition.

'When your name, Social Security number, and everything is out on the Internet, it's hard to do anything,' said Bob.

 

Since his acquittal, Zimmerman, who claimed he shot Mr Martin's in self defense, has faced several allegations of violence, including one by his ex-wife, who divorced him just weeks after the verdict.

Bob said the former neighborhood watch co-ordinator's biggest fear is that he will now be charged with federal civil rights violations for killing Mr Martin.

'He's worried,' he said. 'That if FBI agents come and kick in his door, he's probably gonna shoot a few of them.'

There is an ongoing federal investigation into Zimmerman’s case.
