Stripping child benefit from 1.5million families is unfair and could encourage them to work less, leading financial analysts say.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the way in which the Government was targeting high earners was ill considered. In some cases parents might even be better off apart.

All families with young children are given the benefit and – for a couple with two children – it is worth £1,752 a year.

But next year the Chancellor is planning to stop payouts to parents if one or both is on £42,475 or more – the threshold for the higher rate of tax.

The IFS’s report slammed the ‘cliff-edge’ nature of George Osborne’s move, which triggered fury when it was announced last October.

A couple who both work and each earn £42,000 will continue to receive the benefit while having a family income of £84,000.

But a couple where one parent earns £43,000 and the other earns nothing because they stay at home to look after the children will lose it all.

The IFS said this will ‘create a bizarre and economically damaging set of incentives’ which may make people work less.

Around 170,000 parents would be better off if they asked their boss for a pay cut in order to continue receiving child benefit.

The IFS says the policy will also ‘increase the so-called couple penalty’, a problem the Tories had pledged to tackle.

A single parent might be put off from marrying a higher rate taxpayer due to the loss of the benefit, while a couple could split in order to keep it.

Jill Kirby, a family expert and the author of The Price of Parenthood, said the child benefit change was ‘anti-family’. She added: ‘The IFS’s analysis underlines just how unfair this change will be for one-earner families. It is out of touch with family life, and just how expensive it is.’

Siobhan Freegard, co-founder of Netmums, said: ‘You could not, under any circumstances, argue that it is fair.’

One user of the parenting website 
said: ‘I am absolutely outraged that I have friends who both earn in the
region of what my husband earns so they have an income of £80,000, and 
they will still get the benefit.

'Anti-family': The change will be unfair for one-earner families and is out-of-touch, critics say

‘That is so grossly unfair. I am fit to burst with anger.’

Another said her children would lose out because she will have to move from working four days a week to full time to make up for the loss of her child benefit.

Dr Katherine Rake of the Family and Parenting Institute said: ‘This report is the latest warning that the Government’s child benefit reform proposals could usher in an unfair penalty for many single-earner couples.’

The Treasury insisted yesterday the policy will go ahead despite hints from the Prime Minister that there may be concessions. A spokesman said: ‘It is fair to ask those who are better off in our society to make a contribution to paying down the debts that we have built up over the last decade in Britain.’
