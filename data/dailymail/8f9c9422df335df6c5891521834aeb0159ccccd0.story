A top grammar school was forced to apologise after a group of pupils 'blacked up' for a fancy dress party held as part of a leavers' day celebration.

A picture of four students wearing dark face paint during a fancy dress event at the top boys' school was posted online by Stephen Lehec - headmaster at Aylesbury Grammar School in Buckinghamshire.

The year 11 pupils had dressed as the Jamaican bobsleigh team from the film Cool Runnings to celebrate the end of their school careers.

Three of the pupils are white and one mixed race. In the image, they can be seen wearing wigs and with their faces painted black.

Mr Lehec tweeted an image of them, writing, '#AGS2014 #AGSmemories Jamaican bobsleigh team comes to the party! #coolrunnings'.

He swiftly deleted the tweet but not before it was criticised by other twitter users.

One Julie Davies wrote: 'Aylesbury grammar school students ‘black up’ for a bit of fun? @AGSheadmaster’s timeline makes the 1950’s come alive!'

Her son Harry Davies then wrote: 'Why did @AGSheadmaster think it acceptable for pupils to do this?'

On Twitter user, Julie Davies, reacted in anger to the head's tweet. Her son Harry then wrote: 'Why did @AGSheadmaster think it acceptable for pupils to do this?'

Mr Lehac, who has been head for five years, has now apologised ‘unreservedly’ for the gaffe - and admitted he exercised ‘poor judgment’ in posting the image.

He said: 'Three of the boys ‘blacked up’ as part of dressing up as the characters.

'All of the students were enjoying their day of celebration and the experience, and at no time was there an undertone of any act being of a derogatory or racist nature.

'As with many of the groups and individuals on the day, pictures were taken some of which were posted on Twitter.

'It appears that one of those pictures caused offence and as soon as this was known, the picture was removed.

'It was not the intention of either the students or the school to cause offence and the school unreservedly apologises for any offence that was caused.

'The school accepts that it exercised poor judgement in not acting swiftly when it saw the boys concerned and it has taken steps to ensure that this does not happen at future school events.'

Mr Lehec, who leaves his post at the end of this term, dubbed the leavers day ‘emotional and fun-packed’.

He also claimed the school is ‘highly liberal and respectful’.
