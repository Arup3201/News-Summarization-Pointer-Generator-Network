'It will allow people to grab a data pack or switch to wi-fi if they are nearing the end of their monthly data allowance.'

Complaints about excess data charges rose by a third in the latest financial year as other mobile phone complaints fell, according to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.

Excess data is costly, with customers frequently complaining to the ombudsman about bills in the hundreds and thousands of dollars.

The service, which will also tell users when they've used 50 and 85 per cent of their included data, will be rolled out by the end of November.

One of the telco's biggest competitor, Optus still have delays on their alerts and said their postpaid mobile customers receive SMS alerts once they’ve reached 50%, 85% and 100% of their voice, SMS and data usage.

'We began introducing SMS usage alerts to postpaid mobile plans in September 2012,' said an Optus spokesperson.

'48 hours is the maximum delay time permitted by the TCP code for sending SMS data usage alerts; however Optus aims to notify its customers as quickly as possible and aims to have customers receive alerts in less than 24 hours.'

'The 48 hour time frame  accounts for systems requirements, such as collecting, matching and rating the data from the billing systems and passing that through to our messaging systems, they said.
