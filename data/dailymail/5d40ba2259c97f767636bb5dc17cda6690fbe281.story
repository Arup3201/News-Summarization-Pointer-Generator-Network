In the Bible, Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead.

In Alabama, it appears to have happened again.

Twice.

Despite two euthanasia attempts, this four-year-old mixed-breed dog has refused to die. 

Survivor: Lazarus, four, was given two doses of the lethal injection but was found alive and eating his food

Attempts: Ozark City Animal Shelter in Alabama signed this document to have him put down on September 10

He even survived a car accident that vets said should have killed him.

A rescue organization then decided it had no option but to find him a home - and rename the indestructible canine 'Lazarus' after John Chapter 11, when Jesus shouts to his friend 'Lazarus, come forth', and the dead man emerges from the tomb.

Documents released by Ozark City Animal Shelter in Ozark, Alabama, confirm the scheduled appointment for Lazarus to be put to sleep on September 10.

According to Two By Two Rescue, which now fosters the black shepherd-mix, dogs at the Ozark shelter are put to sleep (PTS) if they go un-adopted for more than a week.

Lazarus's owner moved and handed him in, but when no willing dog-lover took him home, he was given a PTS date.  

'That evening, a vet came to put to sleep the dogs on the list to die,' the organization explains on their Facebook page. 

Indestructible: The black shepherd mix is as energetic as ever, playing in the garden and going on walks

Miracle: He was one of a ward of dogs who were killed by lethal injection that night, but after two he still lived

Adorable: His foster owners at Two By Two Rescue in Alabama say he is obedient and house-trained

'After euthanizing the dogs, he verifies that the heartbeat has ceased. 

'As he checked this particular dog, he heard a faint heartbeat and euthanized him again. 

'He rechecked his heartbeat and signed off on the records that the four-year-old black shepherd mix was dead.

'When the staff arrived in the morning, to their shock the dog was looking at them. He had even eaten his left over food from the day before.

Policy: He was ordered to be put down at Ozark (pictured) because nobody wanted to adopt him after a week

'Though scared and wobbly, he was sitting in his cage alive!' 

Now living with one of the heads of Two By Two Rescue, Lazarus is back to full fitness and responds affectionately to his new name when it is called.

He has a healthy appetite, it house-trained, leash-trained, and doesn't jump on the furniture, they said. 

The owners gushed: 'When one reads of a modern day miracle, you do not have to think about whether you should raise your hand to help. Who does not want to be a part of a miracle? Who does not want to lay hands of love on the survivor of all time?'
