Victim: The body of Colin Dodds was found early this morning in a pool of water

A couple were in mourning yesterday after their teenage son was found dead in a river – the third of their five children they have lost.

Sixteen-year-old Colin Dodds got into difficulties while swimming with two friends on Saturday evening and disappeared under the surface before he could make it to the river bank.

His body was found by police divers  early yesterday.

The tragedy comes three years after parents Colin, 38, and Wendy, 40, lost another son, Ryan, who died suddenly at the age of 14 from multiple organ failure.

He had been diagnosed at birth with Hirschsprung’s disease, a rare condition that affects the bowels, and was on lifelong medication.

The couple’s first child, Kenneth, died in 1992 at six weeks from complications associated with his premature birth.

They also have two daughters, Rebecca, 19, and 13-year-old Nikkita. The family live on a close-knit estate in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, but their home appeared empty yesterday.

It is thought family members had spent the night on the banks of the Wear in the town, waiting for news, until divers located Colin’s body at 4.20am.

A neighbour, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘Your heart just goes out to the family. They’ve lost three boys now, and it’s just heart-breaking. No one deserves to lose one child let alone three.’

Colin and his friends, also 16, are said to have entered the river at Batts Pool, a deep but slow-moving section of water which is a popular spot for fishing.

All-night hunt: Search and rescue teams on the River Wear were called out after the alarm was raised

After his friends raised the alarm a 
major search was launched, including an RAF jet which conducted an 
infrared scan of the river in an attempt to locate the teenager.

Chief Inspector Sukhsham Sahani of 
Durham Constabulary said yesterday: ‘There’s some suggestion that Colin 
was a weak swimmer. It’s too early to tell exactly why he went under 
though.

‘It was a very pleasant, sunny day, but it’s not commonplace for people to actually go diving in at that particular area.

‘The Wear is well known as being unpredictable, you can never estimate the current.

‘I accept that there is a temptation 
on a sunny day to paddle and play around the banks but I want to 
reinforce the message to teenagers that they should be particularly 
mindful of the dangers of playing by a river.

‘The family are distraught, it’s been a tragic end.’

Another of the couple’s neighbours 
said: ‘People don’t often go swimming there, but there’s no way I’ll let
my kids play down there any more. It’s too dangerous. The family must 
be in bits about Colin.’

The teenager is the second child to die in the Wear this year.

On April 27, the river was the scene 
of a major search and rescue operation when eight-year-old Ian Bell was 
swept to his death as he played with friends at a stretch near the Brown
Trout pub at  Sunnybrow, near Willington, County Durham.

The river was swollen with rainfall at the time. Ian’s body was recovered nine days later.

A teenage boy has told how he desperately tried to save his best friend from a river after he began struggling in the water.

A major search and rescue operation was launched after Colin Dodds, 16, got into difficulties in the River Wear at Bishop Auckland at 5.15pm.

Colin and his friends Ryan Howard and Marwan Barq, both 16, had gone to cool off at an area known as Batts Pool near to the Market Square in the town when Colin disappeared.

After an extensive search involving three helicopters, fire and rescue teams, police, and a Hazardous Area Response Team, Colin’s body was recovered in the early hours of Saturday morning from near the bottom of the deep section of the river, close to where his friends last saw him.

Ryan, who had known Colin for around five years and described him as his best friend, told how he attempted to reach Colin before he went under the water.

'I tried to grab him and I tried to swim towards him, but I couldn’t get to him,' he said.

'I stretched my arm out, but I couldn’t reach him, he was too far away.

'He shouted he couldn’t swim, I just started panicking. I told him to kick his legs and arms as much as he could, but then I just saw his head go under and it didn’t come back up.

'I just got out and ran up to the bank to get help. A man rang for an ambulance. I was in so much shock. I was crying and shaking.'

Colin and his friends had been to Darlington before they returned home to Bishop Auckland.

Ryan said: 'We just went in the river to cool off because it was too hot.

'We’ve never been up this part of the river before, but we just went in.

My mum woke me up on Sunday morning to tell me they had found the body at around 4am.

'As soon as I heard I just went and got some flowers and came back up the river to lay them.'

Colin had just started a painting and decorating course at Bishop Auckland college with his friend.

It is the second tragedy to have occurred on the river this year.

In April, eight-year-old Ian Bell of Sunnybrow, County Durham, died after falling into the River Wear as he played with friends by the water near the Brown Trout pub in the village.
