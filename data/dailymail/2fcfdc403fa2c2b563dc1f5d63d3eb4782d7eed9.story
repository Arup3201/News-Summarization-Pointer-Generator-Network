In a country boasting 10 Michelin-starred restaurants you would expect fierce competition to be crowned the nation's top eatery, but Americans have shunned them all in favour of a small food stand in Hawaii.

With its menu written on a whiteboard and just two tables outside, Da Poke Shack in Kailua-Kona certainly doesn't seem like the sort of place to serve up culinary perfection.

But it has been voted No.1 on Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat list - earning a five-star average from more than 600 reviews on the site.

The restaurant averaged five stars from more than 600 reviews on Yelp

The combination of freshly caught fish seasoned and served as a traditional Hawaiin poke - meaning cubed, cut or sliced - has won rave reviews on the site.

One user 'kaulana e' commented: 'Their poke bowl was so outta this world that it has ruined poke from any other place for me.'

The Poke Bowl is a salad that contains greens 
like seaweed or kimchi, Japanese spices, and raw ahi tuna fresh from the
 sea. Dishes like the Poke Bowl go for only $8.00.

Katie B from Chicago wrote: 'I've been back in Chicago for a week and I'm still dreaming of this place. I love poke [and] this was the freshest I've ever had. So many flavors, so many healthy sides...yum.'

Daniel H from Belmont, California wrote: 'This
 place started my infatuation with poke. Seriously folks, you can die 
happy after filling yourself with the deliciousness served here.'

It may look like an ordinary shack but diners give the tiny gem extraordinary reviews

Special of the day

The restaurant doesn't have a set price list and the cost of the menu changes on a daily basis depending on the availability of fresh fish.

Poke's only caveat among fans is that it isn't open for dinner and closes at 6 p.m.

Yelp reviewers warn that the lines at Poke can be long and that taking the food to go is a good option because seating is limited.

One Yelp reviewer suggested that patrons take their food down to the sea for a beach picnic beach for some seaside dining.

Finishing
 second behind Da Poke Shack among Yelp users was another inauspicious food outlet, Paseo
 in Seattle offers Caribbean-style sandwiches, many for less than $10.

Third
 on the list was Kansas City-based Oklahoma Joe's which opened its first
 restaurant in 1996 in a gas station but now has three eateries in the 
city.

Seventh
 on the list was the three Michelin-starred Alinea in Chicago where an 
18 course tasting menu costs $210 per person without wine or tip.

When he was told the award was best in the country he went silent before replying: 'Oh, Wow.'

On its official blog Yelp revealed its engineers used a technique based on the Wilson Score to compile the list of highly rated places to eat.

This method takes into account both star rating and number of reviews to reveal which spots not only have high ratings, but also which are most popular in the Yelp community.

Slate analyzed Yelp's rating system and pointed out that the restaurant ratings have a lot to do with the site's demographics and reflect the taste of young, middle-class, and tech-savvy food aficionados.

Even though Poke may not appeal to the lowest common denominator or to people who don't already seek seafood, it's worth taking a poke inside.
