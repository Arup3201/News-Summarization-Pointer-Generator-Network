Two talented students, a doctor and a junior doctor were ‘swept away’ by a devastating avalanche that left four dead and another critically injured, it was revealed last night.

A survivor of the tragedy said they were all experienced winter walkers who were engulfed as they headed back down a mountain in Glencoe, in the Scottish Highlands.

The victims fell about 1,000ft and were buried in up to 6ft of snow, said one of the Glencoe mountain rescue team.

Victims: Una Finnegan and Christopher Bell died in the avalanche in the Scottish Highlands yesterday afternoon

Police named PhD students Christopher
 Bell, 24, of Lancashire, Tom Chesters, 28, who lived in Leeds, and 
junior doctor Una Finnegan, 25, of County Antrim, as three of the 
victims.

The fourth victim, Rachel Majumdar, 29, was a doctor working at Harrogate District Hospital in North Yorkshire.

A 24-year-old woman from Durham 
survived and was said to be in a critical condition in a Glasgow 
hospital with serious head injuries.

The other survivor, a male climber 
from Liverpool, is believed to have jumped clear of the collapsing snow 
and anchored an ice axe into firmer ground.

He said in a statement: ‘Five of my 
friends and I were descending a mountain in Glencoe in an area known as 
Church Door Buttress when the party was swept away by a snow avalanche.

‘It is with much sadness and deep 
regret that some of my friends have died as a result. All in the group 
loved the mountains and are experienced winter walkers. My sincere 
thanks go to members of the public, mountain rescue teams and other 
emergency services who assisted.’

Police identified the three other victims yesterday but Dr Majumdar’s name was withheld until today to allow her family members to inform other relatives.

The avalanche happened at about 2pm on Saturday as the group began descending the 3,722ft Bidean Nam Bian mountain.

The slope they were walking down is believed to have broken away.

The alarm was raised immediately by 
two climbers, who were not part of the group, who found one of the 
casualties lying in the snow.

The man who survived also contacted 
the emergency services and a mountain rescue team was taken by 
helicopter straight to the scene.

Andy Nelson, of the Glencoe mountain rescue team, said they acted ‘very, very quickly’ as a Royal Navy helicopter was nearby.

He added: ‘The priority was to start probing in the snow and start digging as soon as possible to try and extricate the bodies.’

He said when he got to the scene four climbers were looking for survivors.

He added: ‘There was a lot of 
avalanche debris. Snow had slid down from the top and gathered in a 
fairly smallish area and quite deep, with some signs of equipment lying 
around.

‘We started probing the snow to find the people buried underneath.

Tragedy: The avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian claimed four lives yesterday

‘It was a typical Scottish winter day, with strong winds, which isn’t unusual, and light snow falling.
‘The people were on a ridge walk, not climbing per se but walking, and then they chose to descend on the area that avalanched.

‘It was a reasonable route to take, but unfortunately the snow beneath them was very unstable.
‘Being in an avalanche is literally like standing on a carpet and having it pulled out from underneath you.

‘Any thoughts of trying to swim out from it is futile.

‘You are on steep ground, essentially standing on a raft of snow that is sliding downhill at speeds of maybe 40mph to 50mph.

‘It would have unfolded in a split 
second, they would have felt the snow moving and then they would have 
been travelling at a speed that was impossible to stop.

‘It’s a brutal experience. There are enormous forces at work and you are being twisted about at high speed.’

Close friends today described how Tom Chesters and Dr Majumdar had been an item since they met at university in Leeds.

Sam Morris, 35, said the only consolation in the tragedy was that the couple died side-by-side doing something they both loved.

'They were in love since they met in their first year of university,' he said.

'They were just so soft and sweet with each other - two people so at ease together. They were having fun making plans.

'They had dreams of doing voluntary work oversees together.

'Some of the comfort we have drawn is
 that these guys had been together to the end. At least they were doing 
what they liked doing.'

Mr Morris, who worked with Mr 
Chesters and Mr Bell when they were mountain bike tour guides in the 
Alps, added: 'All four of them were people with a bright future and all 
of them were committed to making a difference. It’s such a loss.'

A colleague of Dr Majumdar described her as one of the finest doctors she had worked with.

The medic, a doctor at Harrogate 
District Hospital in North Yorkshire, was originally from Merseyside but
 had recently been living in Leeds.

Rebecca Leigh, who works at the 
Harrogate hospital, said: 'Rachel was a gifted and dedicated doctor who 
was in the middle of her training.

'A very promising medical career has been cut tragically short. She was one of the finest doctors I have ever worked with.

'All the staff and patients who knew 
Rachel will remember her for her caring nature, with a smile and a 
friendly word for everyone.'

Mr Chesters, said to have been one of
 Britain’s leading competitive orienteerers, had also been living in 
Leeds and was working towards a PhD qualification in medical engineering
 at Hull University.

The university said Mr Chesters had a promising career ahead of him.

Michael Fagan, professor of medical 
and biological engineering, and Catherine Dobson, Mr Chesters’ PhD 
supervisor, said in a statement: 'Tom was a fantastic colleague and 
friend with so much energy and enthusiasm for everything he did.

'He was a real asset to our research 
group and was making great progress with his PhD research into 
osteoporosis. He had a very promising career ahead of him. We will all 
miss him enormously.'

Una Finnegan, 25, from Coleraine in Northern Ireland, had a great zest for life and wanted to make a difference, her former schoolteacher said.

Nicola Madden, vice-principal of Dalriada School in Ballymoney, said the former pupil, who had been working in Edinburgh as a junior doctor, would be badly missed.

'She was bright, bubbly, talented, an amazing student, and academically she was brilliant, one of the top students,' she said.

Ms Finnegan, who secured nine A*s and one A in her GCSEs in 2004, was involved in the Duke of Edinburgh scheme at the school, along with her twin sister, and that led to a love of the mountains and outdoors, Ms Madden added.

She was inspired to become a doctor after attending a humanitarian mission to Moldova in eastern Europe and meeting medics there, the senior teacher said, and also sat on the interview panel which appointed Northern Ireland's first Children's Commissioner.

'She just had a great zest for life and did actually want to make a difference,' Ms Madden said.

Ms Finnegan's father Dr Owen Finnegan was a well-respected heart and chest consultant at the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine.

Following in her father's footsteps she studied medicine at Newcastle University and took her masters in anthropology of health and illness in Edinburgh, where she continued to live.

Ms Finnegan won a shield for debating at school and was deeply interested in politics, with a Rotary Club award taking her to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Ms Madden added.

She also obtained an outdoor challenge scholarship to the Lake District in England, where she gained more experience in difficult terrain.

She had a twin sister, who also studied at the school, as well as other siblings. She left in 2006 but maintained strong links with Dalriada.

Police said Mr Bell was studying for a
 PhD in Ocean Mapping in Oban, Argyll.

Mr Bell's parents were reported to be too upset to comment from their home in Osbaldeston, near Blackburn, but a tribute was issued on the Facebook page of his father's decking business, Evabel.

The statement read: 'We are so sad to let everyone know that Simon and Alison's son Chris was one of the people who were killed in the avalanche in Glencoe.

'Chris was a wonderful son, friend and human being. Our thoughts and prayers are with Simon, Alison and (brother) Ed at this awful time.'

Mr Chesters lived in Leeds and was studying
 for a PhD at Hull University.

Prayers: A special service was held for the avalanche victims at St Mundaís Church

The avalanche warning for Glencoe was ‘considerable’ – two levels down from the most serious.

The investigation into the tragedy will look at whether the group had assessed the risks properly.
Northern Constabulary chief inspector Derek Paterson said: ‘The evidence suggests this was a group of experienced walkers.’

He added: ‘There is no shortage of 
information out there from the mountain rescue service website to the 
information service which gives practical tips and safety skills. We 
would appeal to everyone to use this information.’

Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond called it an ‘appalling tragedy’.

He added: ‘Our immediate thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have been lost.’
