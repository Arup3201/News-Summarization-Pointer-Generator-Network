Prince Harry is taking girlfriend Cressida Bonas off on a romantic African Safari, just like his brother William did with Kate in 2010 when he asked her to marry him.

The Prince, 28, is said to have grown 'very fond' of dance student Miss Bonas, 24, who he has been seeing on and off since July last year. 

Harry arrived in the Angolan capital Luanda yesterday on a visit for the 25th anniversary appeal of a mine clearance charity which was championed by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales.

It is understood he will the head down to Botswana to join Miss Bonas and a group of friends including the Duke and Duchess of York's youngest daughter Princess Eugenie for a week-long break, the Daily Mirror reports.

In October 2010 brother William got down on one knee to the future Duchess of Cambridge on the veranda of an isolated log cabin during a trip to Kenya.

Harry's last serious relationship with Chelsy Davy fizzled out amid rumours that she couldn't handle the pressure of being under the royal spotlight.

He is reportedly desperate to keep things relaxed with Miss Bonas and wants their love to grow 'naturally'.

A friend of Stowe-educated Miss Bonas said in June: 'She and Harry are very fond of each other and taking things one step at a time to see whether or not there might be something more permanent one day.'

Like Miss Davy, Miss Bonas went to study at Leeds University after boarding at £30,000-a-year Stowe School in Buckingham.

She is the daughter of 1960s society beauty Lady Mary Gaye Curzon and her third husband, Old Harrovian businessman Jeffrey Bonas, who divorced in 1994.

It will be a very welcome break for the Prince whose Army friend Corporal James Dunsby, 31, died recently after collapsing on an SAS selection exercise on the Brecon Beacons on July 13.

This week Harry said he was ‘deeply saddened’ by the death of Cpl Dunsby – who had served as his gunner in Afghanistan.

The pair were said to have become 'close friends' during the Princes first tour of Helmand province when they were part of a three-man crew of a Spartan armoured car.

Harry, a junior officer in the Household Cavalry Regiment, acted as commander and Cpl Dunsby was at the controls of the vehicle’s General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG).

The Prince is working on behalf of the 
HALO Trust in Angola where his late mother was passionate about its work
in trying to rid mines and unexploded devices from war-torn lands.

His spokesman said: 'Prince Harry, as patron of the HALO Trust’s 25th Anniversary Appeal, is currently on a private visit to Angola to see HALO’s mine clearance and will be touring minefields and meeting beneficiaries of HALO’s work'.

The late Princess Diana visited minefields being cleared by HALO in Angola just before her death in 1997 to help draw world attention to the horror of landmines.

The HALO Trust works with some of the 
world’s most vulnerable people so they can plant their crops, rebuild 
their homes and raise their families in safety once the mines have been 
cleared.

Prince Harry has already visited minefields in Tete province in Mozambique in 2010 as part of his work with the project.

He met amputees, seeing for himself the devastating impact that landmines have on some of the poorest people in mine-affected communities.

During his trip to Mozambique he spent time with a team of HALO deminers and personally detonated several mines.
