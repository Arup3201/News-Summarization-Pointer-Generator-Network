A Thomas Muller penalty in front of a virtually empty Luzhniki Stadium gifted Bayern Munich the win against CSKA Moscow in this Champions League tie.

UEFA forced the match to be played behind closed doors as punishment for racists chants by the Russian champions' fans during the game against  Viktoria Plzen last December.

The lack of atmosphere did little to distract Bayern, though, as Mario Gotze drew a foul from Mario Fernandes in the box and Muller did the rest from 12 yards.

'Football is a question of atmosphere and emotion,' said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge before the match.

'But there will only be a handful of officials and journalists. I feel sorry for the fans, some of whom haven't missed a single Bayern away match in 25 years.'

Those very supporters are sure to be content with Pep Guardiola's side keeping their 100 per cent intact in Group E, however, even if they were forced to watch it on television.

And ensuring their second Champions League win started with two of Germany's 2014 World Cup heroes.

Gotze, who scored the only goal of the summer's final in Brazil against Argentina, was hacked down in the box by his name-sake Fernandes as he cut inside.

That allowed Muller, the World Cup silver boot winner for Germany, to finish in typical fashion to gift Bayern a 1-0 lead after 22 minutes.

The 25-year-old, up against  Igor Akinfeev, slotted the ball high down the centre of the goal as the CSKA goalkeeper dived to the right. 

It wasn't all comfortable for Guardiola, though, as CSKA were left to rue two wonderful opportunities to draw level before the break. Ahmed Musa, with a burst of pace to skip past Mehdi Benatia, found himself one-on-one with  Manuel Neuer.

The Bayern goalkeeper stood tall and blocked the shot before Zoran Tosic, looking for the ball to settle, saw his rebound go up and over the bar with the goal begging to be scored.

Xabi Alonso, the Bundesliga's new record holder for the most touches in a single match, was largely kept as quiet as those in the Moscow stands during a tense first 45 minutes.

The former Liverpool and Real Madrid midfielder touched the ball 204 times against FC Koln on Saturday, meaning he was in possession on average every 26 seconds, but the 32-year-old couldn't find that same rhythm in a lifeless stadium.

In the second half, though, Bayern showed more intent to put the tie to bed. The German club, sitting in the same group as Manchester City and Roma, were the ones looking likely to score next.

CSKA sat back and parked the bus, allowing waves of Bayern attacks to commence. Substitute Xherdan Shaqiri almost put the final nail in the coffin after being set up by Philipp Lahm, but goalkeeper Akinfeev did well to smother the shot before it was made 2-0. 

Tickets for the tie being unavailable did little to deter those desperate enough to watch the action at the Luzhniki Stadium, though.

A select group of Bayern supporters rented an office in a nearby skyscraper to get a bird's-eye view of the pitch, and took to Twitter to show off their cunning plan.

In the end, those fans' efforts were rewarded with one goal via Muller, but Guardiola will be happy enough with an away win that moved the Bundesliga giants top of Group E.
