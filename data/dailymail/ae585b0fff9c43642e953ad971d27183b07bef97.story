England demonstrated nerves of steel to beat Holland in a penalty shoot-out and lift the European Under 17 Championship trophy for the second time.

The Dutch youngsters were given a pep talk by senior team boss Louis van Gaal before the final in Malta, but Manchester United's manager-in-waiting couldn't inspire them to victory.

England goalkeeper Freddie Woodman saved from Dani van der Moot, while Calvin Verdonk missed the target as Holland crumbled at the last in Malta.

Four textbook penalties from Ryan 
Ledson, Taylor Moore, Callum Cooke and Jonjoe Kenny ensured the Young 
Lions emulated Ross Barkley and the Class of 2010 by lifting the 
European trophy.

In normal 
time, Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke gave England a 25th minute lead, 
spinning inside a crowded six-yard box to turn in Moore’s effort.

But Holland equalised seconds before half-time when Jari Schuurman volleyed home a scooped through ball from Steven Bergwijn.

Both teams wasted chances in a tense second-half before the English penalty hoodoo was forgotten in the shoot-out.

It is a second European triumph for coach John Peacock and suggested that a bright future lies ahead for the national team.

His Class of 2010 featured the likes of Barkley, Connor Wickham, Josh McEachran and Saido Berahino, but now a new generation of talent has written themselves into the history books.

England Director of Football Development Sir Trevor Brooking told Sportsmail afterwards: 'I thought we were the better team overall and deserving of the win tonight. The lads executed John's game plan very well.

'They're a very closely knit group, they're all know each other's game and it all bodes well for the future.'

Peacock
 was without the injured Newcastle United striker Adam Armstrong, who 
injured his ankle in the 2-0 semi-final win over Portugal on Sunday and was forced to settle for a place on the bench.

His
 replacement, the Tottenham tyro Joshua Onomah, was the driving force 
behind many of England’s attacks with his pace and close control.

Partnered
 in an offensive formation by Chelsea’s Izzy Brown and Fulham’s Patrick 
Roberts, England caused plenty of problems for the Dutch defence.

Brown
 curled an effort at goal inside the first two minutes and Onomah almost
 flicked a Kenny cross over his head and in as England forced their 
opponents, the most impressive team so far in the tournament, onto the 
back foot.

For all their 
direct running, however, England’s goal came from a corner. Roberts’ 
delivery was only half-cleared and when Moore returned the ball with 
pace, Solanke diverted it past goalkeeper Yanick van Osch.

Holland
 quickly recovered their poise and restored parity on 39 minutes when 
Schuurman got goal side of Joseph Gomez and found the net despite 
Woodman getting a strong hand to it.

Van
 Osch blocked a Ledson free-kick from inside the box after he had 
accidentally picked up a back pass and Kenny saw a back post header land
 on the roof of the net.

Spot-kicks
 are not usually comfortable territory for England sides but this time 
there were no mistakes from 12 yards and captain Ledson beamed as he 
lifted the trophy in a storm of gold confetti.
