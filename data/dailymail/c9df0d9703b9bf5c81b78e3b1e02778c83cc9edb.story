When Barcelona went to Doha this week to meet and greet their current shirt sponsor Qatar Airways it was significant that they chose Neymar to represent them. 

With his 23rd birthday falling on Thursday and already having clocked up more air miles than any of his team-mates since the summer, the Brazilian would have benefitted from the rest more than any other player in the dressing room, but needs must – Neymar is the face of the future for Barca and when the club meets its biggest and most important sponsor, he has to be there.

Qatar Airways are due to end their sponsorship of the club in 2016. If a new deal is to be agreed it will need to be finalised before the end of this year. With Neymar and Gerard Pique turning up in Doha on Wednesday there was talk that the sponsor was considering doubling its existing offer of €30million (£22.4million) a year to €60m (£44.8m) a year.

Barca are currently debating the possibilities of continuing with Qatar. That debate would be cut short if a firm offer of €60m (£44.8m) is indeed made. The answer would be yes.

With the European Commission more determined than ever to cut off all perceived sources of state aid to the big clubs in Spain, private money is more important than ever and Barca need the Qatar cash. 

Qatar also need the association with the club and with the freshest face in football in Neymar, whose kudos has rocketed in the last eight months with his heroic attempt to drag a poor Brazil side to World Cup glory and his 22 goals for Barca this season.

As well as being crucial to the club’s new shirt sponsorship deal, Neymar will be integral to Barcelona’s battle with Nike to improve the €40m (£29.9m) a season offer currently in play. Barca want closer to the £75m that Adidas will pay Manchester United every year from next season. They believe having one of the American sport’s brand’s top clients in Neymar should entitle them to that.

Barcelona are also in negotiations with two broadcasters for the rights to show their games next season. The pressure from the Spanish government to force Madrid and Barca by law to negotiate with the other 18 clubs and share the income has completely stalled and the Catalan club are trying to improve on their current €140m (£105.5m) a season deal. Again Neymar’s part in promoting whichever company wins the rights, will be of vital importance.

Back at training on Thursday, the day of his birthday, he was congratulated by his team-mates and there were messages from all over the world including from the last magical Brazilian to light up the Camp Nou, Ronaldinho, and from Pele who had predicted so many ‘new Peles’ that he was always going to get one right in the end and seems to have done so with Neymar.

Barca need Neymar to work for them as much off the pitch as on it to justify the outlay of what now looks like more than €90m (£67.2m) for the player they bought from Santos in a convoluted deal that involved 11 different contracts to both the club and the player’s parents' company N&N - a piece of cutting-edge financial engineering which they were proud of at the time but that has landed them in court with the Spanish tax man wanting a greater share of the pot.

There does not seem to be any friction between Neymar and Messi as the baton is passed between them

The good news for the club is that the player is a natural at fulfilling his commercial responsibilities – handling the spotlight as well as David Beckham did at Madrid. 

One of the arguments Barcelona used to convince Neymar to sign for them and not go to Madrid, who made a late push, was that he would have less pressure in Catalonia playing alongside Lionel Messi and a host of Spain internationals who had won the World Cup. But now that the focus starts to shift gently from Messi to the Brazilian superstar four years his junior, there are no signs that he cannot handle it.

There are also no signs of conflict with Messi, something that Johan Cruyff predicted when the Brazilian first arrived. ‘You can’t have two captains on the same boat’ was his famous doomsday prediction, but from the moment Neymar gave his first press conference and declared that he wanted to learn from Messi who he repeatedly called ‘the best in the world’ things have gone smoothly. 

Neither does the Argentine mind that some of the marketing burden, that he has always hated, is now shared.

If both skippers are trying to sail in the same direction it seems there is not a problem and both Neymar and Messi are doing their bit to make sure Barcelona stay financially ahead of their big European rivals. Aged 27 Messi remains the image of the club that has won the European Cup more than any side this century. But at 23 Neymar is the face of the future.
