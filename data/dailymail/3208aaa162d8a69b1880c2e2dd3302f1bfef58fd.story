A rape victim who was abused by a sex grooming gang from the age of 13 had to endure 12 days of excruciating questions during her attackers trial, it emerged today.

The girl, who was 18 when she took the witness stand, was aggressively quizzed about her sex life during the harrowing trial.

She broke down after being repeatedly accused of lying by lawyers acting for the seven men on trial and at one point was accused of being 'naughty'.

The victim, who had been sold to men across northern England and the Midlands since the age of 13,
 was even rebuked by one lawyer for fiddling and told to concentrate.

The case even shocked the judge Robin Onions who was left close to despair and one defence barrister later walked out of the trial in disgust over the treatment of another witness.

Another vulnerable victim - who was visibly upset - was asked by a 
defence lawyer to read out line by line from a police statement she gave
 detailing alleged sexual abuse by her stepfather.

The treatment of witnesses in the trial - which took place at Stafford Crown Court in 2011 and can now only be reported - has resulted in charities and politicians calling for the better 
treatment of vulnerable witnesses in child sex cases.

Critics have said the trial shamed British justice.

According to The Times, Judge Onions said at the time: 'I feel as though I've been hit over the head with a large hammer and there seems no end to it.'

Speaking to The Times, Keir Starmer, 
QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said that he would be holding 
talks  which could lead to young victims taking part in pre-recorded 
cross-examination sessions rather than being cross-examined in court.

Alan
 Wardle, of the NSPCC, told the newspaper: 'We have surely reached the 
point where this kind of appalling treatment of child abuse victims 
cannot continue.'

The case involved the trial of seven men who and denied offences against girls said to have been used for sex. The accused men were Mohammed Younis, Mahroof Khan, Mohammed Islam Choudhrey, Tanveer Ahmed, Mohammed Ali Sultan, Mubarek Ali, Ahdel Ali.

Some of the lawyers acting for the men were accused of aggressively questioning the witnesses in court.

Way forward: Keir Starmer, QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has hinted that future young victims could take part in pre-recorded cross-examination sessions rather than appear in court

During her 12 days of cross-examination, The 18-year-old victim, who had been sold to men across northern England and the Midlands since the age of 13,
 spent 12 days being cross examined by a number of defence lawyers 
acting for the accused men.

She was even rebuked by one lawyer for fiddling and told to concentrate.

After reliving her horrors, she finally broke down in tears in front of the appalled jury. But even this did not prevent even tougher questioning for another victim.

The girl, who had told the court of being taken by men to have sex with their friends, was asked to read out line by line from a previous statement which she had made to police about being sexually abused by her stepfather.

The allegations were made by the girl when she was 13 but were withdrawn by the girl.

She said she had made up the allegations but later said she had been abused but dropped the case because she was concerned about the impact on her mother.

However, this did not prevent defence barrister Mohammed Tayyab Khan from using the statement to say that her evidence to the court could not be trusted.

As the girl painfully read out line by line of what her stepfather did to her, jurors looked on in anger and another defence barrister walked out of the court apparently in disgust.

The seven defendants were convicted of child sex offences against four girls. The trial at Stafford collapsed in September 2011 and the men were later convicted in a series of smaller retrials.

Akhtar and Anjum Dogar, Mohammed Karrar, 38, Bassam Karrar, 33, and Kamar Jamil, 27, were each 
found guilty of multiple counts of rape among other offences. Mohammed 
Karrar was also found guilty of supplying heroin.

Last May nine Asian men were convicted of the systematic grooming and sexual abuse of white girls in Heywood and Rochdale.

The
victims were vulnerable teenagers from deprived, dysfunctional 
backgrounds who were targeted in 'honeypot locations' where young people
regularly congregated, such as takeaway food shops.
