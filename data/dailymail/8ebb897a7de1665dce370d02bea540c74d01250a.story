A drunk rugby coach crashed his car while dressed as pop star Rhianna - and then sped off because he was embarrassed about his outfit.

Glenn Stroud had been at a Stars in Their Eyes fancy dress party at a nearby rugby club and was still in costume when he hit an oncoming car in Newport, Wales in the early hours of 9 November.

The former rugby player, who coaches the sport at local schools, failed to stop at the scene - claiming that he didn't want to be seen dressed up as the singer.

But the other driver followed him and phoned the police, who found the 43-year-old in his curly red wig, purple dress and make-up at the wheel of his Ford Ka.

Stroud was banned today from the roads for twenty months after admitting drink driving. He was more than twice the legal drink-drive limit when he crashed.

Judge Richard Williams said: 'This was a calculated attempt to avoid detection.

'You failed to stop after a road traffic accident, the offence of failing to stop is a serious aggravating factor.'

Stroud had been at the party at St Julians Rugby Club on 9 November, Newport Magistrates' Court heard.

After the party, he got behind the wheel of his car with 86 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 35 milligrams. 

He was seen 'swerving all over the road' before he crashed into a Vauxhall Corsa in the early hours of the morning on November 9.

No one was injured but damage was caused to both cars and Stroud tried to drive off from the scene. 

Scene: Stroud was more than twice the legal drink-drive limit when he decided to drive home after the themed party at nearby St Julian's Rugby Club. He crashed into another car on Caerleon Road, Newport, pictured

Ian George, defending, said: 'One of the reasons Stroud didn't stop immediately was because of what he was wearing.'

Stroud, of Caerleon near Newport, admitted driving under the influence of alcohol and failing to stop after a road accident.

The coach, who works for Newport City Council coaching rugby at local schools and formerly played for leading Welsh club side Cross Keys, was also fined £668.
