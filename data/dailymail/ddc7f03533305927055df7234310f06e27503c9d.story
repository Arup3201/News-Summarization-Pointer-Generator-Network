A teenager and a six-year-old girl have 
been gang raped in separate incidents at their schools in the latest sex
 attacks to shame India.

Police said her body was found outside the school premises in the village of Bal Singh Khera, just 10 miles from a village former American President Bill Clinton is visiting today.

Reports that a six-year-old girl was raped at a school in Bangalore have sparked protests among parents

Local police Superintendent Soumitra Yadav said: 'The exact cause of death can be established only after the postmortem report arrives. 

'But according to our preliminary investigation, this is a being perceived as a case of gang rape.'

Security is 
being ramped up in the area due to the visit of President Clinton, 67, 
who is visiting the neighbouring village of Mohanlalganj to promote the 
work of his Clinton Foundation.

Meanwhile, a younger
 child was allegedly targeted by a security guard and a gym teacher at 
an upmarket school in India's southern city of Bangalore.

The 
six-year-old's parents, from the eastern state of Odisha, only 
discovered what happened a few days ago after their daughter complained 
of a stomach ache and was taken to hospital.

Two men have been arrested in connection with the July 2 attack that happened on the school campus during class hours.

A
 gym instructor and a security guard were questioned by Karnataka 
police, but a second identification parade is being held to confirm 
their involvement.

Bangalore's Deputy Commissioner of Police TD Pawar, who is leading the investigation, told The Times of India: 'We have a tough job on hand. There are 27 gym instructors in the school.

'The two we have now are suspects. The girl is traumatized and we are trying to check with her as to who harmed her.'

Reports
 of the rape sparked protests outside Vibgyor School, near the city's 
Kundalahalli Gate, as hundreds of parents pulled down its gates and 
shouted slogans.

'They have handled it very shoddily,' said Vivek Sharma, parent of a boy studying in the school.

On
 Thursday, school chairman Rustom Kerawala addressed a meeting of the 
parents where he offered his 'sincere apologies' and promised 'full 
cooperation' with the police in investigation.

The
 two cases are the latest in a series of sexual assaults that have made 
headlines in India, a country where rape offences are reported every 21 
minutes on average.

In
 2012 India saw an outpouring of grief and a new scrutiny of sexual 
violence after a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital 
New Delhi.

More recently, it emerged last week a 14-year-old
 girl was dragged into a forest and raped on the orders of a village 
council in remote eastern India in retaliation for a sex assault blamed 
on her brother.

The attack took place after midnight on Sunday in a small village in Jharkhand state's Bokaro district.

Last
 month, two teenage girls were allegedly raped before they were found 
swinging from a mango tree in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

The
 new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised a zero tolerance approach
 on crimes against women, but violence and discrimination against women 
in remain deeply entrenched in society.
