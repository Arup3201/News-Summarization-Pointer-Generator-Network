New signing Toni Kroos has said playing for Real Madrid is a 'step up' from Bayern Munich and that he moved to Spain to win trophies.

The former Bayern Munich man signed for a fee thought to be £24m after failing to extend his contract with the German champions.

Kroos has had considerable success for a player of his age, having already won 13 major trophies including the World Cup, Champions League, World Club Cup and German title.

But the 24-year-old insisted he would not rest on his laurels. Speaking to Marca, he said: 'I know how important it is for Real Madrid to win titles and I'm the man to do just that.

'Only one thing was acceptable at Bayern: winning trophies. When I arrived here I immediately knew the same thing applies.

'I know that I've joined a highly successful club and I'm going to do everything in my power to ensure that success continues. Winning trophies with this team is an exciting challenge for me. My target is to win every competition.'

The German was quick to endear himself to the Madrid fans, saying: 'I want to express my sadness regarding (Alfredo) Di Stefano's passing.

'I want to thank Real Madrid for giving me this opportunity and the possibility to play for this club which, for me, is the biggest in the world. I also thank Bayern for giving me the chance to join Real Madrid.

'I had made my mind up to leave Bayern Munich. I wanted to come to Real Madrid. That was the only option I considered. It's a step up from Bayern. Real have gone to great lengths to bring me in.'

When quizzed about the his decision to join the European Championships, Kroos refused to give an exact timeline of events but insisted the move was nothing to do with his relationship to Pep Guardiola.

'I can't tell you the exact date,' he said, 'There has been contact for a long time, but the World Cup was on the horizon and that was what was most important. I knew Real were interested and I was interested in joining them.

'I told Joachim Löw as much in Brazil because he had a right to know. He was happy for me and congratulated me. He told me Real Madrid are a top-class club

' I didn't have any problems with Guardiola; in fact, his style of play benefited me.'
