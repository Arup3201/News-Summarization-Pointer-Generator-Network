Chelsea are playing hardball with Frank Lampard as talks over his new contract threaten to break down.

Although Jose Mourinho wants Lampard to stay next season, the financial package for the midfield star is out of his control.

Mourinho said in a end-of-season briefing with the football club’s board that he would like Lampard,  36 in June, for one more season.

The Chelsea manager also wants Lampard, who has been selected for the World Cup squad, to work his way into coaching at the club.

But Chelsea would like Lampard to take a substantial cut on his £150,000-a-week wage.

Lampard made 40 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions last season, although he is no longer sure of a first-team place.

He has always sworn that he will never play for another club in the Barclays Premier League, but LA Galaxy have a long-standing interest in Lampard and the MLS side would offer him a contract.

Chelsea had hoped to tie up his contract at the same time as John Terry, but the latter agreed his new financial terms this week.
