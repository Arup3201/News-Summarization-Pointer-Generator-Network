A Navy veteran who refused to kowtow to Hitler has finally been stopped in his tracks – by 'ageist' health and safety red tape.

Albert 'Dusty' Miller, 89, has been barred from serving as a marshal and standard-bearer at Royal British Legion events because he is too old to be insured.

The ex-serviceman – who served with distinction in the Royal Navy both in the Atlantic convoys and as a submariner in the Burma campaign – was told he could no longer help organise and lead parades, a role he has carried out for 38 years.

Mr Miller was given the bad news just before the dedication of Liverpool's Garden of Remembrance – and told he could only attend future events as a 'guest'.

Jim Ryan, chairman of the Legion's Merseyside and West Lancashire branch, said he had not been eligible for insurance since he was 85, but the organisation had only just realised the oversight.

Mr Miller, from Kirkby, Merseyside, said: 'Hitler couldn't stop me but red tape has rained on my poppy parade.

'I never even knew standard-bearers had to be insured.'

A close friend of Mr Miller's, who still works with the Legion and refused to be named,  said: 'To say that anyone over 85 is redundant to an organisation like the Royal British Legion flies completely in the face of  that message.

'It is indirect ageism by jobsworths – and from an organisation that highlights the plight of war veterans that is crazy.'

Mr Miller joined the Royal Navy at the age of 16 as a cadet and received four campaign medals – the 39-45 Star, the Atlantic medal for the convoys, the Burma Star with a Pacific clasp, and the International Submarine Service medal.

The Royal British Legion insisted that its hands were tied for 'health and safety reasons'.

A spokesperson said: 'The Legion has a duty of care towards all parade marshals and standard bearers.

'For health and safety reasons, the Legion's insurance policy only covers persons up to the age of 85.

'We are extremely grateful to Mr Miller for his years of dedicated service to the Legion and of course welcome him to attend future parades as a guest.'
