Les Ferdinand has admitted that QPR face a tough task if they are to keep striker Charlie Austin in the summer.

Austin, 25, has been a key player for the London club, scoring 15 goals in the Premier League this season.

But Ferdinand, the club's director of football, knows that Austin may well be tempted to leave for a bigger club come the summer.

Ferdinand said: 'We will be trying our best come the end of the season to make sure Charlie signs up and stays.

'But you know what we do understand is that players are ambitious. Sometimes they want to look elsewhere.

'We will be doing our best to make sure we give him the opportunity to stay and play in the Premier League.

'The aim is to replenish the squad and we don't want to be losing our best players like Charlie.'

QPR currently sit in 18th position in the Premier League on 22 points, three points behind Aston Villa.
