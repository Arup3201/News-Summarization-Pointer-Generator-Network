Queens Park Rangers have opened talks with Tim Sherwood over becoming their next manager.

Harry Redknapp left Loftus Road on Tuesday, citing the fact he requires two knee operations as the reason behind his decision.

And Sherwood is understood to be the preferred choice of Les Ferdinand, who has been given a new role as director of football by chairman Tony Fernandes.

Queens Park Rangers have failed to pick up a single point in their 11 matches away from Loftus Road 

Initial talks have taken place regarding the former Spurs manager taking control at QPR, and if discussions prove successful Sherwood could be in situ for the weekend.

Ferdinand had been placed in temporary charge of the first-team along with coach Chris Ramsey but the club have now confirmed that Kevin Bond and Ramsey will take control until further notice.

Joe Jordan, who was also part of Redknapp's backroom staff, has left the club. 

Bond is hopeful of staying at the club in some capacity and held a meeting with Ferdinand, who wants him to be part of the new set-up, on Tuesday night to discuss a role.

The departure of coach Glenn Hoddle, who was understood to be a contender to replace Redknapp, has cleared the path for Sherwood to resume his management career at Loftus Road.

The pair do not see eye-to-eye in a feud that stems back to when Sherwood played under Hoddle at Spurs in the early 2000s.

However, Fernandes still needs to rubber-stamp the club's move for Sherwood, something that is said not to be a formality yet. 

The QPR chairman tweeted on Wednesday: 'We the board will hire someone who cares, thinks long term, wants to be involved in developing the academy, has coaching skills, will play young players and is a winner.

'The names that fans are mentioning to me are names that we are going to consider. I would say 3 interview will e (sic) done. All fan feedback has been taken in.

'I want to thank Harry for all he's done and being gracious in his words about the club. And Glenn and Joe.

'Our players have sent me many positive messages and are ready for the fight. That strong spirt is immense for me. Come on you rsss.'

Sherwood has been out of work since leaving Tottenham last summer, although he has been in contention for jobs at Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion. 

Ferdinand was appointed head of football operations at QPR in October and was soon followed on to the staff by Ramsey in a role on the club's academy.

Ferdinand and Ramsey worked together at Tottenham last season as assistants to Sherwood when he took over from Andre Villas-Boas at White Hart Lane.

Sherwood, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season, needed special dispensation from the Premier League to operate as a manager at Spurs because he did not have the UEFA Pro Licence required to do the job. 

He had to enrol for the first available course and is midway through it with the Football Association of Wales. It will be completed later this year.

Ferdinand will now be responsible for overseeing the entire football department at QPR, which means he is likely to have a say in the appointment of a new manager.

After handing the former Hoops striker his new role, chairman Fernandes said in a statement: 'I've been really impressed with the job Les has done in his short time here and as such I am keen for his role to evolve, with the clear mandate of assisting us in developing and evolving the footballing department, from the academy to the first team.

'This is a new strategy for us. Our recruitment policy at QPR is changing. The recent addition of Ryan Manning to the Elite Development Squad is a sign of what we will be trying to do here.

'We want to develop a philosophy of buying young, hungry players, who can go on to forge decent careers with us.'

Tony Fernandes has confirmed Les Ferdinand has been handed a new role as Director of Football at QPR.

R's legend Ferdinand, who re-joined the club in October in the position of Head of Football Operations, will now be responsible for overseeing the entire footballing department at Loftus Road, with a mandate of building for the future.

The 48-year-old has already made significant improvements to the footballing philosophy of the club since his return – and the Board are now keen for him to have more of a hands-on role at all levels, particularly in the field of recruitment, working closely with the First Team.

Fernandes told www.qpr.co.uk: 'I've been really impressed with the job Les has done in his short time here and as such I am keen for his role to evolve, with the clear mandate of assisting us in developing and evolving the footballing department, from the Academy to the First Team.

'This is a new strategy for us. Our recruitment policy at QPR is changing. The recent addition of Ryan Manning to the Elite Development Squad is a sign of what we will be trying to do here.

'We want to develop a philosophy of buying young, hungry players, who can go on to forge decent careers with us.'

He added: 'I've had many messages from supporters, of all ages, who aren't – for one reason or another – satisfied with what's going on at QPR at the moment, but I can reassure all Rangers fans that we are putting the building blocks in place to move things in the right direction for the future.

'We've made a number of mistakes in the transfer market over the last few years and it's something we want to change. We don't want to be a buying club – we want to nurture young talent and build a young, ambitious team.

'Premier League survival is our priority in the short term, but in the medium and long term we want to make sure everything is in place, from the Academy upwards, to create a culture and philosophy within the club that QPR fans can be proud of.

'Les bleeds blue and white and working closely with the First Team and Academy management, particularly in recruitment, he is going to play a key role in moving us forward over the coming months and years.'

Ferdinand, of course, flourished for QPR following a move from Hayes in 1987, and the former England front-man, after completing his Governance Course a St George's Park – backed by the PFA and FA – recently, is relishing his latest challenge.

'Everyone knows what this club means to me and if anything the last few months have only enhanced the feelings I have for QPR,' he said.

'Working closely with Tony and the Board, I can assure QPR fans that they are desperate to create a lasting legacy at Loftus Road and the role of Director of Football will be hugely important in terms of where we want to take this club in the future.

'Some of the management courses I've taken over the last few years were with a role like this in mind, so I couldn't be more delighted.'
