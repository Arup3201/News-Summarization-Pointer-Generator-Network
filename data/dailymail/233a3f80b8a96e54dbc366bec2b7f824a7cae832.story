She only unveiled her new lingerie range  last week but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, one of the UK's hardest working models, is back - this time modelling M&S' new Spring collection.

Sporting soft pale pink knits, a chic polka dot shirt and a racy leather pencil skirt, the 27-year-old looks every inch the stylish star in the new photos.

The pieces, which are taken from the brand's Autograph range, launched in stores nationwide this week.

In the striking shots, the star still has her signature long locks, although she recently went for the chop and now has a fashionable long bob (or 'lob') hairdo.

The model enlisted the help of London-based hairdresser George Northwood to create the style and his sister Sally to colour her hair in time for the New Year. 

Writing on Twitter, Rosie said: 'Ready for 2015 equipped with a fresh new do! Thank you @georgenorthwood @sallynorthwood #BeThereOrHaveBadHair.'

This all-pink look is one of the highlights and includes a chic pair of fashionable silver flats 

But while Rosie might have new hair, unlike the rest of us, she has no plans to go on a traditional New Year diet.

The 27-year-old, who also fronted Coca Cola Life's new campaign, says that while she does swear by all things clean and lean, she allows herself sweet treats too.

'I'm travelling all the time so it's hard to find a balance and eat healthily,' she explained. 'I really love my food - I'm always being tempted by room service and I eat out a lot - but I try and eat organic with natural ingredients.

'At home I cook as clean and healthy as possible, so when I'm out I can enjoy a pudding or a glass of wine and actually enjoy myself.'

She also revealed her favourite way to stay fit - dance classes during which she channels her inner Beyonce.

The Devon-born model said: 'I love dance classes! I love Body by Simone - I go with my girlfriends, we all go and sweat our faces off and then have a healthy breakfast.

'You have to make it fun. I like to go to dance classes and feel like Beyoncé.'

Rosie has long been a part of the team at M&S and her lingerie range for Autograph is one of the store's best-selling collections.

Despite her busy schedule, the actress and model, who recently spoke of her desire to build a brand from her name, was unveiled as the face of hair brand Moroccanoil earlier this year.

Rosie is the haircare brand's first ever famous face and shows off her glossy, flowing hair in the new campaign imagery.

The model and actress is also gearing up to star in Mad Max: Fury Road alongside Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz and Tom Hardy and is rumoured to have a beauty range in the works.
