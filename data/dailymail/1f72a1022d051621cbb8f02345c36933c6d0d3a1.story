A heroic British father-of-five drowned trying to save his wife from rough seas in Australia, moments after trying to comfort her by quipping: 'Trust you!'

Bernard and Amanda Robinson, from Broadstairs, Kent, were fishing from rocks on Twilight Beach in Esperance, Western Australia, when she slipped and fell into the sea.

Mr Robinson, 54, tried to help his wife by stretching out his fishing rod for her to hold on to but lost his footing and toppled into the sea.

'He died trying to save me': Bernard and Amanda Robinson who moved from Broadstairs, in Kent, to Yanchep, near Perth, Western Australia in 2009, were fishing from rocks in Esperance when she slipped into the sea

The stricken couple, who moved from Broadstairs, Kent, to Yanchep, near Perth, in 2009, trod water together for up to an hour before Mrs Robinson managed to pull herself onto a rock.

She then turned around and see her husband floating face down in the water yards away.

And in a tragic but poetic turn, a pod of dolphins then appeared from the depths and followed Mr Robinson's body as it was brought ashore by boat.

Amanda, 51, who is originally from Birmingham, told The Sun: 'Maybe the dolphins felt the distress he was in. He would have loved animals trying to help him.'

Describing the last moments with her partner of 27 years, she added: 'We were tossed around like rag dolls, pulled down deep into the ocean only to be thrown up on to rocks... Then, as if by magic, the ocean became calm.'

That was when she drifted towards a rock and hauled herself to safety.

By then, though, it was too late and Mr Robinson had been overcome by exhaustion and drowned.

His distraught wife added: 'He gave his life in order to save mine.'
