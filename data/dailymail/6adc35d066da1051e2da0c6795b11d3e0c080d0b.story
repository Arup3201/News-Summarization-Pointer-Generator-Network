Sophia Blackburn bit a chunk from a woman's ear because she turned off UB40 at a pub disco has been jailed for four years

A single mother of two who bit a chunk from a woman’s ear because she turned off UB40 at a pub disco has been jailed for four years.

Sophia Blackburn, 24, sunk her teeth into Stacey Wilkinson's ear - scarring her for life  - during a fight next to a disc jockey booth.

Blackburn, from Bradford, clamped her teeth on Wilkinson’s left ear while pinning her on the dance floor.

Part of her tooth was found sticking in Miss Wilkinson’s left ear and her thumbnail was bitten away in the attack.

The horrific wound needed 35 stitches, and now Miss Wilkinson has quit her job because she is mentally and physically scarred.

The women were in the Horse and Groom, Wibsey, Bradford, West Yorkshire, on 25 May, last year, when they began to argue.

Miss Wilkinson said: 'My uncle was the DJ on the night and he’d asked me to sort out the last three songs for the night, which would take us up to 11pm.

'UB40 had been playing and when I put the next track on she just went nuts and attacked me.'

Others intervened in the melee.

Blackburn was convicted by a jury at Bradford Crown Court last month of wounding Miss Wilkinson with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm.

Blackburn flew into a rage when she did not get her choice of dance music, Bradford Crown Court heard.

She punched Miss Wilkinson to the floor, got on top of her and sank her teeth into her ear. She bit half of it off and spat it out before leaving the pub.

Miss Wilkinson, 25, said: 'We were going out to celebrate my partner Steve's brother's girlfriend becoming pregnant and went to a couple of other places before we got to the Horse and Groom pub around 11 pm.

'Apparently Sophia and her friends had been asking for music all night, and the DJ Mick had let them type the songs they wanted in because he's dyslexic, but I wasn't aware of this because I hadn't been there.

'Around quarter to 12, the landlady said just three more songs could go on before closing, so Mick asked me to type them in from the playlist.

'UB40 was on at the time but I wasn't aware anybody had put the song on. I was just helping Mick out because of his dyslexia.

'Sophia came over and started shouting at me about it and I told her it was nothing to do with me and she should speak to Mick. All of a sudden she came running at me, punched me and we fell into a table. I was in complete shock.

'The table flipped over, and we fell backwards, me underneath and Sophia on top of me. She grabbed hold of my hair and then started biting my ear.

'I put my thumb in her mouth to get her off but she ended up biting my fingernail off. I had hold of her head and I was terrified to let go in case my whole ear came off.

'Eventually everyone got her off me, but along with it was some of my ear, and there was blood everywhere.

'I was in shock. I could feel the pain and see the blood but I wasn't sure what had happened.

'A glass hit Mick in the eye and his decks and laptop fell and smashed. Glass was everywhere.

'Even now everything is surreal. It was such an odd night. I wish I didn't go out.

Stacey Wilkinson, victim

'I don't know why she felt the need to attack me over changing a song. Whatever I put on, she must not have liked it.'

'You have shown no real regard or consideration for the evil you perpetuated that night,' Judge Robert Bartfield told her.

Miss Wilkinson was left with a deformed ear needing further surgery. 

'This is a terrible disfigurement for a woman,' the judge said.

Prosecutor Andrew Kershaw said Blackburn had a conviction for battery and a reprimand for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

He read from a victim impact statement by Miss Wilkinson in which she spoke of the fear, paranoia, loss of sleep and anxiety she had suffered since the attack, which left her needing 35 stitches.

Miss Wilkinson said: 'UB40 had been playing and when I put the next track on she just went nuts and attacked me'

She had given up her job in a nursing home because she no longer wanted to wear her hair up and she was shy and anxious in her social life because she felt disfigured.

In mitigation, Blackburn’s barrister, Tina Landale, said it was a spontaneous assault in drink and her client was shocked by the consequences.

After the case, Detective Constable Ailsa Jones said: 'This was a shocking attack which has left the victim scarred for life. We hope the sentence handed down today will help to give her and her family some closure.'
