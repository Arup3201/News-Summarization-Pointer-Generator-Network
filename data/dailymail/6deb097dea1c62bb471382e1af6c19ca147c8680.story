The ex-CBS news anchor who lost his job after allegedly choking his wife in a fight, appeared in court on Tuesday after violating a protective order and calling her more than 120 times.

Rob Morrison was forced to quit his $300,000-a-year job for WCBS-TV in New York after his arrest, and has allegedly continued to harass his estranged wife Ashley Morrison, a former CBS MoneyWatch reporter.

The 46-year-old was arrested on June 16, after his wife complained to police when she received 121 calls. She told authorities she just wanted to clarify her protective order and didn't intend to have her husband arrested.

However, officers say she was 'physically shaking' when she came into the police station, and was in a 'very fragile state'.

She told officers she feared her husband 'could kill her if she got him arrested'.

He is currently free on $50,000 bond and say he only called to contact their 9-year-old son.

'I want the system to start working for me,' Morrison complained in Stamford Superior Court. 'I'm a great dad who deserves to spend time with his son and it shouldn't be at the whim. It's not capricious.'

His attorney Frank DiScala says Morrison has a daily 5pm FaceTime call with his son that isn't being kept.

'The reason why we're here is he wants to see his son,' DiScala told Judge Thomas Colin. 'I'm asking he be permitted to call his wife's phone once a day.'

Estranged wife Ashley Morrison says she didn't mean to get her husband arrested when she reported him to police. Her husband says he was just trying to talk to their son

Ashley Morrison has since relocted to Florida with their 9-year-old son

The judge will address that custody issue back in court on August 19.

According to Ashley Morrison's Facebook page, she has recently moved with their son to Florida.

'I have relocated and I am happy to now call Florida home!!" she wrote.

'Jack and I will be spending a lot of our time relaxing, hanging out in the pool and getting our new house set up, until I go back to work in a couple of weeks!!'

It's unclear what Ashley's new job is.

Morrison
 was previously accused of trying to strangle his wife
last year but the charges were dropped in April of this year.

He ended up resigning from his post at WCBS-TV.

The couple who have been together for 11 years reconciled last summer â€” but split up for a second time two months ago.
