A man battling a rare form of cancer has had part of his face removed in a bid to save his life.

Raymond Martin, 63, has facial angiosarcoma, a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels.

The great-grandfather of two has endured a series of operations, the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face.

He first noticed a spot on his cheek but never expected it would lead to a serious cancer diagnosis, which would change his appearance so dramatically.

‘It all started with just a spot and it was nothing special so I didn’t worry about it,’ Mr Martin said.

‘But the spot started to spread so I went to see a GP and it was first thought that it could be a rash or infection and I was given a course of antibiotics.’

However, the antibiotics did not work and because his face got worse, he was sent to hospital for tests.

‘Never in a hundred years, could I have imagined that I would be told I had cancer,’ Mr  Martin said.

Medics at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary took a skin biopsy from Mr Martin and experts identified that he had a rare form of cancer that was affecting a large part of his face.

There was no other option than to perform
 life-saving surgery to remove the tumour in a 12 hour operation, with 
skin taken from Mr Martin’s thigh, grafted onto his face.

It took a number of weeks before Mr Martin plucked up the courage to look at himself in a mirror.

‘I knew that the operation had to be done, so I just had to get on with it, said the father-of-four.

‘I was in hospital for a few weeks and I did feel a bit dubious about how I’d look after the operation as I didn’t know what to expect.

‘When I was going home from hospital I thought “I don’t want to look in the mirror”.

‘It was a few weeks before I had a proper look at myself and I did get frightened as it looked like I had a bandage on my face.

‘I was shocked and worried to go out of the house as I didn’t know what reaction I’d get from people.

‘It took a few months before I left my home and I would spend a lot of time in my bedroom watching TV.’

Angiosarcoma is a relatively rare soft tissue tumour. 

It usually occurs in the head, neck, and especially in the scalp of elderly people.

Its presentation varies from a small plaque to multifocal nodules.

The treatment depends on the extent of the disease, but most cases are treated with wide excision - a surgical procedure to remove a small area of diseased or problematic tissue with a margin of normal tissue - and reconstruction.

Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are advocated in recurrent or extensive abnormalities in tissue.

Following the operation, doctors were optimistic that they had removed the whole tumour and Mr Martin underwent an intensive course of chemotherapy in the hope of killing any remaining cancer cells.

But, just six months later, the facial angiosarcoma returned and once again he required further treatment at the region’s Northern Centre for Cancer Care.

Mr Martin has had a total of six operations, including one to reconstruct his nose, which did not work and will require further facial surgery in the future.

Experts have told Mr Martin that it is fortunate the cancer was growing outside his body and was therefore detected in time, as angiosarcoma tumours often grow internally.

He said: ‘I feel I’m one of the lucky ones as my cancer was picked up quick enough for treatment.

‘I just take things each day at a time, what else can I do? I have to live my life and be happy.’

It is unlikely that Mr Martin’s cancer will be cured and he continues to get chemotherapy once a week with the aim of slowing down the progression of the disease.

It is feared he will lose his right eye as the cancer has spread to that area.

Mr Martin, his wife Alice, 62, and their family, have received help from Macmillan Cancer Support.
