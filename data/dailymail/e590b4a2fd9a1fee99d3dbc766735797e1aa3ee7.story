If you can remember dinner-party meals along the lines of curried lentil soup followed by bacon and onion hotpot, or if your early attempts at home decorating involved stenciling, rag-rolling and distressing every conceivable surface, then you will see The Brewer’s House, just off Brick Lane in London’s East End, as a monument to your impecunious youth.

For this is the home of Jocasta Innes, author of  77 bestselling instructional tomes – including The Pauper’s Cook Book and The Thrifty Decorator –  who died, aged 78, last April. Her son, the novelist Jason Goodwin, leads me through shady passages  to the kitchen, where much of her  work was done.

‘This was her lair,’ says Jason, 49, pointing towards the Aga and the giant farmhouse table. ‘You’d find her here  at her typewriter – she never came to terms with a computer – struggling  to meet some deadline, cooking a  meal and welcoming all-comers at the same time.

‘She was a truly creative person. When she did something – be it cooking, decorating or talking – she went at it with a fury.’

Jocasta’s life story reads like the plot line for a novel. Born in Nanking, China, where her father was an executive for Shell Oil, in the 1960s, she  was the archetypal party girl. Stunningly beautiful and a graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, she was pursued by men including Mark Boxer, the cartoonist.

She soon married film director Richard Goodwin, with whom she had a daughter, the writer Daisy Goodwin. Then the plot gets murky. Firstly, she had Jason as the result of an affair with the New Age writer John Mitchell, who numbered The Rolling Stones among  his friends.

Then, as the swinging Sixties rolled into the peace-and-love Seventies, she went to live with struggling Newcastle novelist Joe Potts in a bedsit in Dorset, leaving Richard holding the children.

Unsurprisingly, the relationship with Joe didn’t last and, in 1979, Jocasta moved to London. Around this time trendy young things were discovering rough-and-ready parts of the capital where sizeable properties – often warehouses or abandoned commercial buildings – could be bought for very little.

Illusions: Many of the £2.3million home¿s features, from the stone walls to black and white floor tiles, were painted on by the late Jocasta Innes

Cosy and central: The house is located in the trendy Spitalfields area and has four bedrooms on three floors

With her finger on the zeitgeist as usual, Jocasta found The Brewer’s House, near Spitalfields Market, part of a brewing complex and the last word in derelict dumps.

It was boarded up with corrugated iron, and she had to climb on to the roof to gain entry through an upstairs window. Inside, she found rooms waist-deep in old TVs, mattresses, fridges and cookers. She bought it from the Spitalfields Trust for a song.

By this time Jocasta had money coming through from her books and she was also working as the home editor of Cosmopolitan magazine. So she set up camp on the top storey of the building and worked on the rest of it, room by room, as and when funds allowed.

Famous words: Writer and interior designer Jocasta Innes

It was just after moving into The Brewer’s House that she also started a new relationship, with her next-door neighbour, the modernist architect Sir Richard MacCormac.

Today the wreck that was The Brewer’s House has been quite exquisitely restored.

The sitting room and study have a heavy Dickensian glow about them, and throughout the four-bedroom, three-storey house nothing is what it seems.

Touch the surfaces and the tiled walls of the hall are, in fact, hand-painted trompe l’oeil; the marbled walls are similar pieces of fakery; the black-and-white granite stone floors have been created with glossy chequer-board painting.

There is a remarkable rounded landing where one wall panel opens, magically, into a secret passage leading to Sir Richard MacCormac’s house next door.

‘My mother believed that you don’t have to spend a fortune on fancy decorators to make a beautiful home,’ says Jason.

The Brewer’s House is a showpiece  of Jocasta’s artistry. Quite accidentally, for she was never motivated by money, it has also been an extremely profitable project – it’s on the market for £2.3 million.

The Brick Lane area, with its bars, restaurants and markets, is now seriously ‘hip’.

Easy access to the Square Mile also adds to its value.

‘Perhaps a wealthy banker will buy it: hopefully one with an interest in architecture,’ says Jason.

‘Whoever it is, I just hope they do something funky with it. My mother would have liked that.’
