A pregnant mother is set to become the youngest woman in Britain to give birth to two sets of twins - aged just 21.

Annie Gladstone had her first pair four years ago and will now make the record books after falling pregnant with another set.

Miss Gladstone and fiance Rich Porter, 26, conceived naturally but said they cannot understand their fertility as neither of their families has a history of twins.

The full-time mother, who turns 22 at the end of September, will become the youngest woman in Britain to have two sets of twins when they arrive on or around September 11.

Pregnant Annie Gladstone is set to become the youngest in the UK to have two sets of twins when she gives birth to two baby girls in September. She is already mother to four-year-old twins Lillie and Jayden

After discovering she was pregnant in January, Miss Gladstone and her fiance Rich Porter were told at their 12-week scan that they were expecting twins again

Royal College of Midwives says it has not heard of anyone in the UK having two sets of twins at such an early age.

Miss Gladstone said: 'When the nurse told us we were shocked. You could have heard a pin drop.

'It took about a minute for me to begin breathing, and Rich’s face went so pale.

'But after the initial shock, of course we are delighted. We’ve been told we’re having girls, so Rich and Jayden are definitely about to get very outnumbered at home.

'They say your second baby is easier to cope with than your first, but since our first and second came at the same time, we’re hoping babies three and four are a breeze.

'As far as I know, I’m the youngest mum in Britain to have two sets of twins. I’m delighted.'

Miss Gladstone said she always wanted another baby after Lillie and Jayden were born in April 2011 so was delighted when she realised in January she was pregnant again.

But the couple's joy turned to shock when they were told at their 12-week scan that they were expecting two new arrivals.

The couple said they were shocked to discover they were expecting twins again, as neither family has a history of twins

When the new arrivals - both girls - arrive on or around September 11, Miss Gladstone said her husband-to-be and son Jayden will be well and truly outnumbered

The couple, from Farnborough, say neither of them are from big families, and neither family has a history of twins.

Miss Gladstone has an older brother and a younger sister, while Mr Porter, who works as a warehouse manager, has an older sister.

She said: 'Obviously when I fell pregnant at 17 we weren’t using fertility treatment, and I wasn’t this time either. I always wanted kids. We both did.

'It was a right shock when we were told Annie was carrying twins. My face dropped'

'But we never wanted a big family. Last year I said to Rich that I wanted another baby, and then we’d stop. I guess good things come in twos.'

But her second pregnancy is taking its toll on Miss Gladstone. She is suffering from chronic SPD - Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction - pelvic pain caused by the stress carrying to babies.

For the last part of her pregnancy, the 21-year-old will be forced to use crutches to get around.

She said: 'SPD is horrible. I’m in constant pain and it’s making looking after Jayden and Lillie so much harder.

'But it should go away once the babies are born, so I’ll have them to tire me out instead.'

Her husband-to-be, said: 'It was a right shock when we were told Annie was carrying twins. My face dropped.

'At first, the doctor said they might be triplets, but thankfully that didn’t turn out to be the case. As long as they are healthy, that’s all that matters.

'I’ll always work as much and as hard as I can to support my family - I can’t understand why other fathers wouldn’t.

'I’m excited. I just hope we don’t have any more.'

Jacque Gerrard, director for England at the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'I have been a midwife for over 30 years and have never seen someone at such a young age have two sets of twins in succession like this.

'As a mother of twins myself I know what she is going through and I wish her well in her pregnancy.

'Women having twins and multiple births are monitored closely throughout the pregnancy particularly when it is a teenage pregnancy.

'The experience gained with her first set of twins will be helpful when she gives birth second time round.

'The important point is that she gets the right levels of support from the midwives and local maternity services throughout the pregnancy and also postnatally along with support from her partner and family.

'Midwives are very skilled at supporting women with multiple pregnancy but do so in partnership with obstetricians.'
