A 27-year-old woman went into labor Wednesday while trying to enter the country through the Port of Lukeville in Arizona.

Federal authorities at the southern Arizona crossing ended up having to help deliver the baby.

A short time later, she successfully gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

The boy will be a United States citizen since he was born on American soil.

Ajo Ambulance was notified, but the Tohono O'odham tribal member went into labor and required the assistance of U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers medically trained as EMTs.

The officers assessed the woman and determined she would probably deliver prior to the ambulance's arrival

Once the woman gave birth, she and her newborn son were taken to a hospital in Phoenix.

Such chaotic scenes have become a familiar sign in recent months with young boys and girls sleeping under blankets wall-to-wall on concrete floors.

A few hundred miles away at a crowded Border Patrol station in south Texas, thousands of immigrants are being held before they are transferred to shelters across the U.S.

More than 47,000 unaccompanied children have entered the country illegally this year it what President Obama is calling an 'urgent humanitarian situation'.

Border Patrol stations like the one in Brownsville were not meant for long-term custody. Immigrants are supposed to wait there until they are processed and taken to detention centers.

But the surge in children arriving without their parents has overwhelmed the government.

The surge, which has been building for three years, comes amid a steep overall increase in immigrant arrests in southernmost Texas.

The children are mostly from Central America. They pose a particular challenge because the law requires Customs and Border Protection to transfer them to the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours.

That agency's network of about 100 shelters around the country has been over capacity for months and is now caring for more than 7,600 children.

Children began backing up in already overcrowded Border Patrol stations. Eventually, the Border Patrol began flying them to Arizona, where it set up a processing center.

From there, they are sent to private shelters or temporary housing at barracks on military bases in California, Texas and Oklahoma.

Most of the children are turning themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents, who transport them to a facility where they are given 'notices to appear' before an immigration judge between 10 and 90 days later.

HHS takes over after that, drawing on a $1 billion budget to house, feed and otherwise care for the children until a suitable adult family member can be located to claim them.

Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other state officials have authorized the Texas Department of Public Safety to begin emergency 'surge operations' along the border with Mexico in response to an influx of immigrants making the illegal crossing, mostly women and children from Central America.

State leaders authorized the department to spend on the surge as needed and provided an additional $1.3 million per week, according to a statement Perry’s office released late Wednesday.

Department officials will be expected to report results of the surge to the governor and Legislature 'periodically,' the statement said.

'Texas can't afford to wait for Washington to act on this crisis, and we will not sit idly by while the safety and security of our citizens are threatened,' Perry said.

'Until the federal government recognizes the danger it’s putting our citizens in by its inaction to secure the border, Texas law enforcement must do everything they can to keep our citizens and communities safe.'

The surge is expected to continue through the end of the year, the statement said.
