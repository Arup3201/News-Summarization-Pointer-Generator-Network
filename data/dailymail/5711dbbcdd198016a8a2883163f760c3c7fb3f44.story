Radamel Falcao has thanked Manchester United for taking a gamble on him.

The Colombia striker has admitted to being affected by the cruciate ligament injury which cost him a place at the World Cup last summer but confirmed he wants to commit his future to United after they signed him on an initial loan from Monaco.

Speaking to Onda Cero, Falcao said: ‘Manchester United were the ones that gambled on me when it was very difficult to do so. It has been a very difficult year, not just in my professional career.

‘What happened at the start of the year [his serious knee injury] affected me in every way, but it has also helped me grow as a human being, to think about many things, to mature.’

United signed Falcao on a season-long loan deal from Monaco with an option to buy in place. 

The parties have reportedly agreed personal terms and the permanent transfer would cost £43million.

The 28-year-old added: ‘In terms of my thoughts and plans for the future, I want to stay at Manchester United for the coming years.

‘I’m still going to need some time to be OK, but I am feeling very comfortable and very good on the pitch, in harmony with myself, with the ball and with football.’

Falcao’s departure prompted protests from fans at Monaco and he can understand their frustration following his exit, and that of James Rodriguez to Real Madrid.

He said: ‘Maybe it’s understandable because of the expectations that were generated last season. Now they have lowered their spending and kept the foundations. 

'They have changed the policy and now rely more on young players who can get good results.

‘I am very thankful to them for the good and bad moments, it all made me grow.’
