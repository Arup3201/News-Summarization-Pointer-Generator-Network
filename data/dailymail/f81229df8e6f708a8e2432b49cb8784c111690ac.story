A homeless man who returned a woman's lost engagement ring has bought himself a house with donations given by strangers who were touched by his honesty.

Billy Ray Harris has gone from begging on a Kansas City street corner to living in a house of his own after $180,000 was raised by people who wanted to help get his life back on track.

The page was set up after Mr Harris returned a $4,000 engagement ring to Sarah Darling, who accidentally dropped it into his change cup earlier this year in the Missouri town.

In just three months a staggering $180,000 was raised on the site which describes Mr Harris as 'a great man who could use some help.'

Since the astonishing sum was raised, Mr Harris has bought a house, a car and has obtained a part-time job.

His biggest reward however was to be reunited with estranged family members who thought he was dead.
