The dark side of the moon could someday be home to human colonies if Esa has its way

The European Space Agency believes that conquering the moon is a crucial step for human deep space exploration.

In a video, titled 'Destination: Moon', the agency outlines its plans for making a home on the hostile terrain that covers the far side of the lunar surface.

'In the future, the moon can become a place where the nations of the world can come together to understand our common origins, to build a common future, and to share a common journey beyond,' the video says.

The moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means its near side always points towards our planet.

Until now, researchers have debated why this near side has an abundance of features - such as the 'man on the moon'.

The man on the moon is in fact, dark maria, or seas – large flat areas of basalt on the moon’s near side. No such features exist on far side of the moon

The dark side, meanwhile, contains one of the largest impact crater in the solar system, dubbed the  which is believed to have formed four billion years ago.

The general consensus on the moon's origin is that it probably formed shortly after Earth and was the result of a Mars-sized object hitting Earth with a glancing but devastating impact.

This giant impact hypothesis suggests that the outer layers of Earth and the object were flung into space and eventually formed the moon. 

Earth and the impact object did not just melt; parts of them vapourised, creating a disk of rock, magma and vapor around Earth.

The moon and Earth loomed large in each others skies when they formed. The geometry was similar to the rocky exoplanets recently discovered very close to their stars.

The moon was 10 to 20 times closer to Earth than it is now, and the researchers found that it quickly assumed a tidally locked position - where the same side always faces our planet.

The same real estate on the moon has probably always faced Earth. Tidal locking is a product of the gravity of both objects.

Its diameter is roughly 1,550 miles (2,500 km), making it stretches across nearly a quarter of the moon.

While parts of the crater are shrouded in perpetual darkness, its rim features huge mountainous peaks that are bathed in near-constant sunlight.

Esa wants to send robots to these peaks, and eventually humans.

It says the crater's rim is an ideal place to land humans because they have 'the potential for near continuous solar power and a spectacular view over the rugged and cratered landscape below.'

'Here we will put into practice the lesson from years on the International Space Station, to establish a facility akin to those that we see in Antarctica today,' it adds. 

In 2009, Nasa's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite analysed the chemical composition of the material below the moon's South Pole and discovered traces of frozen water.

Esa is hoping to find out if water exists elsewhere on the moon, and if so, they want to understand where it came found.

If the moon has huge stores of water, future colonies could use the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to create rocket fuel.

'[This could] propel us further into the solar system and onto the next destination of our journey into the cosmos,' the video says.

Future missions could also use the far side of the moon as a shield against radio signals coming from Earth in order to look farther into space.

Esa want humans and probes to visit rim of South Pole-Aitken basin

@highlight

While parts of the basin are shrouded in perpetual darkness, its rim features huge mountainous peaks that are bathed in constant sunlight

@highlight

This could provide continuous solar power to colonies and probes

Esa is also hoping to find stores of water that could generate fuel
