The conduct of ten police officers identified though Professor Alexis Jay's (pictured) report into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham is to be investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission

Ten officers are under investigation by the police watchdog over the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, it was confirmed today.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission said the South Yorkshire Police officers whose conduct will be investigated were all identified through the Jay Report.

The report, published in August, found that more than 1,400 children had been subjected to child sexual exploitation in the town between 1997 and 2013. 

In her report, Professor Alexis Jay criticised the way in which South Yorkshire Police and Rotherham Council dealt with complaints from teenage girls who said they had been raped and trafficked by gangs of mainly Asian men.

The IPCC said the officers are part of a group of 13 referred to the watchdog by South Yorkshire Police.

The other three officers, who were identified through a separate internal review by South Yorkshire Police rather than the Jay Report, will not face investigation at this time.

The IPCC has decided that two do not justify an investigation involving the commission at this stage and the status of the third remains under review.

IPCC Commissioner Kathryn Stone said: 'The amount of public concern across the country about this episode and the impact on confidence in the police means it is important that a fully independent investigation is conducted to establish how South Yorkshire Police dealt with child sexual exploitation.

'I sincerely hope that victims and their families will see this investigation as a positive step towards answering the many questions they must have. I have met with South Yorkshire Police and am reassured by their commitment to fully cooperate with the investigation.'

The spotlight first fell on Rotherham in 2010 when five men, described by a judge as 'sexual predators', were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex.

The five men - Umar Razaq, Adil Hussain, Razwan Razaq, Zafran Ramzan, and Mohsin Khan - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances.

One of the men branded his victim a ‘white bitch’ when she resisted, while a second smirked: ‘I’ve used you and abused you.'

The men, all British-born Pakistanis, attacked the four girls in play areas, parks and in the back of their cars, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

They gave them gifts and introduced them to their friends. The girls were abused so frequently that after many months it ‘became a way of life’.

The girls, who were being monitored by social services, were eventually rescued by police and removed from their homes amid growing concerns for their safety.

In her report, Professor Jay said senior police and council officials must have known what was happening but failed to act, with staff reluctant to report their concerns out of fear of being called racist.

Children as young as 11 were trafficked, beaten, and raped by large numbers of men between 1997 and 2013, the council commissioned review into child protection revealed.

The report found that 1,400 children were sexually exploited in Rotherham over a 16-year period. Adil Hussain (left) and Razwan Razaq (right) were jailed in 2010 for grooming young girls in the town

Zafran Ramzan, 21, (left) was jailed for nine years and Mohsin Khan (right) for four in the same case

More than a third of the cases were already know to agencies, but according to Professor Jay: 'Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist'.

She condemned the 'blatant' collective failures by the council's leadership, concluding: 'It is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered.'

Fears had also been raised by schools over the 16 years but the alerts went uninvestigated.

Teachers reported seeing children as young as 11, 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis, given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown men in Rotherham or other local towns and cities.

The majority of victims believed the perpetrators to be their boyfriend who gave them gifts, alcohol and drugs. Some of the victims still maintain they were not groomed or abused.

Analysing the case studies, Professor Jay said many of the children came from dysfunctional families, had parents with addictions, and had suffered domestic or sexual abuse as a child.

Today the IPCC has identified seven parts of the report, which was published in August, that could lead to misconduct allegations against the officers under investigation.

These include claims that one officer argued against the category of sexual abuse being used because he believed the child had consented to the incident.

There are also allegations that evidence relating to a suspected rape was lost, and that two officers had failed to properly investigate an incident in which a young girl was found drunk in the back of a car.

The controversy that followed the publication of the Jay Report report led to a series of high-profile resignations including Rotherham council leader Roger Stone, council chief executive Martin Kimber and council director of children's services Joyce Thacker.

The most high profile resignation was that of South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright, who was the Rotherham councillor overseeing children's services between 2005 and 2010.

South Yorkshire's chief constable David Crompton has also been under pressure to explain his force's attitude towards CSE over the last 15 years.

Mr Crompton has pledged to investigate individual cases and stressed that his force has seen a massive increase in the number of officers and other staff devoted to tackling CSE in the last couple of years.

Last month, the the National Crime Agency (NCA) announced it would lead an investigation into outstanding allegations of CSE in Rotherham.

The NCA said it was taking on the inquiry following a request from Mr Crompton. 

Today the IPCC identified seven parts of the report, which was published in August, that could lead to misconduct allegations against the officers under investigation.
