Yemeni officials said today that a U.S. drone strike has hit a convoy heading to wedding party, killing 15 people.

Their party was mistaken for an al Qaeda convoy, local security officials said on Thursday.

The officials did not identify the plane in the strike in central al-Bayda province, but tribal and local media sources said that it was a drone.

'An air strike missed its target and 
hit a wedding car convoy, ten people were killed immediately and another
 five who were injured died after being admitted to the hospital,' one 
security official said.

Five more people were injured, the officials said.

Department of Defense made no comment when contacted by MailOnline on Thursday.

The
 United States has stepped up drone strikes as part of a campaign 
against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), regarded by Washington
 as the most active wing of the militant network.

Yemen,
 AQAP's main stronghold, is among a handful of countries where the 
United States acknowledges using drones, although it does not comment on
 the practice.

A U.S. drone reportedly killed 15 civilians in Yemen who were on their way to a wedding

Human Rights
 Watch said in a detailed report in August that U.S. missile strikes, 
including armed drone attacks, have killed dozens of civilians in Yemen.

Stabilizing
 the country, which is also struggling with southern separatists and 
northern rebels, is an international priority due to fears of disorder 
in a state that flanks top oil producer Saudi Arabia and major shipping 
lanes.

On Monday, missiles fired from a U.S. drone killed at least three people traveling in a car in eastern Yemen.
