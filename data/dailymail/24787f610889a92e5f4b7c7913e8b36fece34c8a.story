A Nevada math teacher is being hailed a hero after he was killed confronting a 7th grader who opened fire at his school on Monday morning.

Michael Landsberry, a popular 8th grade math teacher at Sparks Middle School, ran unarmed across the basketball courts towards the 14-year-old shooter and told him to put the handgun down, witnesses said.

The boy responded by shooting Mr Landsberry, hitting him once and killing him. The middle school student then turned the handgun on himself. It is believed the student stole the semi-automatic handgun from his parents' home.

Mr Landsberry, a 45-year-old veteran Marine and member of the Nevada Army National Guard, had spent the past weekend celebrating his wedding anniversary with wife Sharon, family members said. The teacher also has two stepdaughters.

Mr Landsberry's brother Reggie told Anderson Cooper that his brother was an 'all-round good person'.

He added: 'He was the kind of person, if someone needed help, he would be there.'

The shooter's name has not been released
 and neither has a motive for the shooting which took place around 15 
minutes before the school bell rang for the start of classes.

Before the shooting, witnesses said they
 could hear the gunman saying 'my life is over' and demanding 'Why you 
people making fun of me?' and 'Why you laughing at me?'

Around 20 to 30 middle school students witnessed the multiple shootings.

A seventh-grade student called Andrew Thompson told IBNlive: 'A kid started getting mad and he pulled out a gun and shoots my friend, one of my friends at least.

'And then he walked up to a teacher and says back up. The teacher started backing up and he pulled the trigger.'

There were other reports from school students that the shooter had been a target for bullies.

A school friend of the shooter told Piers Morgan on CNN: 'He was a really nice kid. He would make you smile.'

Her mother added: 'He was getting picked on regularly... but he was a very nice boy to everybody.'
