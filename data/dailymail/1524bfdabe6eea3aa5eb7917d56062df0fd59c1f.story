These amazing photographs captured by a tourist in Iceland show the Northern Lights dancing in the night sky while clashing with the orange glow of an erupting volcano.

Stefan Brenner travelled more than 9,000 miles to witness the celestial display – and it was well worth it as he was able to take in the rare double treat.

The 31-year-old, from Vienna, snapped the spectacular photos of the Northern Lights and the glow of the Holuhraun lava field while visiting the Jokulsarlon glacial lake at the edge of Iceland's Vatnajokull National Park.

Photographer Stefan Brenner captured the amazing images while visiting the Jokulsarlon glacial lake at the edge of Vatnajokull National Park

Mr Brenner travelled 9,000 miles to witness the celestial display, which blended with the orange glow of the Holuhraun lava field

Stefan said: 'I really love them and cannot get enough of them. I've seen them when they have been extremely strong two times now when the sun activity was very high.

'They were so bright, colourful and fast, just out of this world.'

The natural phenomena lasted around two hours and Stefan described the colourful display as 'unreal'.

He said: 'Jokulsarlon itself is one of the most beautiful and magical places in Iceland. Combined with two of the most fascinating natural phenomena it was so unreal and hard to believe.

The software engineer's fascinating photos show the green, purple and orange glows reflecting off the surface of the glacial lake

The glow from the Holuhraun lava field eruption was located about 50 miles from the Jokulsarlon glacial lake in south-east Iceland

'I just felt at one with nature and completely forgot everything else. Every time I see them I'm wondering what the people in the old days felt when they didn't know what these lights are.'

The glow from the Holuhraun eruption was located about 50 miles  north of the breath-taking glacial lake, where the green, purple and orange colours reflected off the water's surface.

The Holuhraun eruption began last summer and is the largest to occur in Iceland since the Laki eruption from 1783-1784.

Stefan, a software engineer, bought a professional DSLR camera and lens to get the most out of his photos of the Northern Lights. He hopes to turn his passion into a full-time career.

He said: 'Most of the time you cannot see the purple colour with your naked eye. But when they are really strong you can see the purple, pink and red colours with your eyes.

'But then they are too bright to take good pictures because the foreground objects gets too dark - depending whether it is full moon or not.

'It all depends very much on the strength of the sun activity. Currently the sun activity is on a maximum and will decrease over the next few years.

'I hope that one day I earn enough money just with my photography to be able to travel around the world and capture all the beauties of our wonderful planet.'
