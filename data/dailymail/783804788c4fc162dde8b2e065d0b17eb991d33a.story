Callous dog owner Mark Lacy has been banned from keeping animals for a decade after he neglected his own pet so badly it developed terrible skin conditions, pneumonia and hypothermia.

In these horrific images Staffordshire bull terrier Breeze appears hairless and emaciated after months of neglect by Lacy at his home in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear.

The 42-year-old failed to take the animal to a vet when it developed three separate illnesses and the eight-year-old dog later contracted pneumonia.

Disgraceful: Staffordshire bull terrier Breeze was discovered suffering from pneumonia, hypothermia and serious skin conditions

RSPCA officers discovered the starving animal following a tip off by someone worried about the dog's condition.

Once inside Lacy's house, the inspectors discovered the animal was an 'emaciated state' with a constant cough and an obvious skin complaint.

Last week, Lacy pleaded guilty at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court to three counts of causing an animal unnecessary suffering.

Gaunt: RSPCA officers discovered the starving animal following a tip off by someone worried about the dog's condition.

The court heard that a vet found Breeze had lost all her hair, suffering from alopecia as well as pneumonia, and they said the weight loss was down to malnutrition. She also had hypothermia and officers said she had to be put down.

On his last appearance in court, Lacy was warned he could be jailed over the treatment of Breeze, and was back in the dock this week to be sentenced.

Magistrates gave him a 12-week prison sentence but suspended it for 12 months, and disqualified him from owning animals for 10 years.

Lacy can apply for the ban to be lifted after five years. RSPCA inspector Jaqui Miller said: 'It is a very good result and one that matches the severity of this case.

'Breeze was really suffering, and had been for a long time.

'That meant that, ultimately, we could not save her.

'I think the magistrates have come to the right decision.'

The court heard that Lacy was 'embarrassed' by his failure to get eight-year-old Breeze the right medical treatment.

Clive McKeag, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, said: 'She was almost totally devoid of hair and the inspector could see she was severely underweight, and all of her ribs, spine and hips were on show, and she had a constant cough.'
