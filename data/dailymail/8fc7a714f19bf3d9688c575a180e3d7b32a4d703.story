Minnesota coach Jerry Kill suffered another game-day seizure, at 
halftime while the Gophers were playing Western Illinois on Saturday, 
and was taken to a local hospital as a precaution.

The university said Kill was resting comfortably, after he was taken 
away on a stretcher following his latest episode. Kill was lying on the 
ground right after the Gophers left for the locker room with a 7-6 lead,
writhing back and forth for several minutes with medical staff 
surrounding him in attempt to keep him as still as possible to prevent 
injury.

Kill has worked with doctors to bring his seizures under better 
control with medication, rest, nutrition and exercise, but the stress of
a game day is hard to avoid.

History: Coach Jerry Kill has suffered several seizures, including one in 2010, pictured here

Kill suffered a seizure in the locker room
at halftime last November during a loss to Michigan State, his third 
documented episode during a game at Minnesota since taking over there in 
2011.

He had seizures after a defeat by Northwestern last October and also 
in September 2011, on the sideline near the end of his first game at TCF
Bank Stadium, a loss to New Mexico State. Other episodes have occurred 
elsewhere, without warning as epileptics know all too well.

The university was aware of Kill's condition when he was hired and 
has long insisted it isn't a deterrent to his ability to succeed in the 
job.

Kill was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2005. It has since gone into remission. He now runs a charity to help those in need fund cancer treatment

After the last publicized seizure, the one during the Michigan 
State game last season, athletic director Norwood Teague said the school
has '100 percent confidence in Jerry.'

Teague added then: 'You don't want to downplay it, but you get to the
point of realizing that it's just something he has to deal with at 
times.'

In 2005, Kill was diagnosed with kidney cancer, which is now in remission. After his diagnosis, Kill founded the Coach Kill Cancer Fund foundation to assist low-income southern Illinois residents with treatment.

Kill had another health scare during a game against North Dakota in 2010, when he was hospitalized for dehydration hours after the game.

Kill also had seizures on game day in 2001 and 2005, at Southern Illinois.
