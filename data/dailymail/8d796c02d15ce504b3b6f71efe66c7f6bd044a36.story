Ryan Reid, 27, terrorised his victims by turning up at their homes and workplaces and sent them dozens of sexual messages online

A police officer is facing jail after admitting stalking and harassing a string of young women.

Ryan Reid, 27, terrorised his victims by turning up at their homes and workplaces and sent them dozens of sexual messages online.

He also used his position to access confidential data about people who were not under investigation using police computers and disclosed it to others.

The special constable sent naked pictures of himself to one of the women along with grossly offensive messages on Facebook.

Reid, of Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, who was stationed at Carluke Police Office, pleaded guilty to seven charges involving five women when he appeared at Lanark Sheriff Court.

He carried out the offences between October, 2010, and March, 2013 and one of his victims was just 15 when he began contacting her.

One of the women worked in a petrol station and Reid repeatedly turned up there while she was working alone over an eight-month period.

He repeatedly loitered outside the home of another young women, sent her messages, approached her outside a pub and tried to arrange to meet her over a six-month period.

After he was charged, Reid took to his Facebook page to complain that he had just been trying to be a 'nice guy'.

He wrote: 'I am willing to explain things to people if they ask me.

'If anyone has formed an opinion of me without actually speaking to me about things fair enough that's their problem, and if you don't want me on your Facebook anymore just f****** delete me. Too hard to be a nice guy anymore.'

He added: 'Every time a woman drops their trousers - promotion. 'Every time a man drops theirs - disciplinary action.

'Where's the equality in that?'

He later posted: 'It's not until I sit and think about it, I realise how much of a mess I have made of my life.'

Reid, who was stationed at Carluke Police Office (right) carried out the offences between October, 2010, and March, 2013 and one of his victims was just 15 when he began contacting her.

Unmarried Reid, who is originally from Penicuik, Midlothian, lives alone in a small flat in the village of Lesmahagow.

He admitted two charges of stalking women, three under the Communications Act and one under the Sexual Offences Act.

He also pleaded guilty to an offence under the Data Protection Act that he did 'knowingly or recklessly and without the consent of the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Scotland obtain and disclose personal data by repeatedly accessing various police systems with no operational reason for doing so.'

Reid had not guilty pleas accepted to a further six charges of causing annoyance or needless anxiety to six separate women by repeatedly sending them messages.

Sheriff Nikola Stewart deferred sentence on Reid until next month for a full range of background reports.
