Support: Sarah Palin last night said that if she lived in South Carolina she would vote for Newt Gingrich as Republican presidential candidate

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin threw her support behind presidential candidate Newt Gingrich last night.

But she drew short of backing him, saying that if she lived in South Carolina she would vote for Gingrich to prevent Mitt Romney becoming the Republican nominee.

Palin said she wants to see the Republican primary continue.

Should frontrunner Romney win Saturday's primary vote in South Carolina then he will stand against President Barack Obama for election later this year.

At this stage, Palin said she wants to keep the Republican nomination open as the GOP candidates are improving as the contest continues.

She told Fox News: 'If I
 were a South Carolinian... I would want to see this thing continue because iron 
sharpens iron, steel sharpens steel. These guys are getting better in 
their debates.

'If I had to vote in South Carolina, in order to keep 
this thing going, I'd vote for Newt. And I would want things to 
continue. More debates, more vetting of candidates.'

Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008, considered entering the presidential race last year but ultimately decided not to. She still holds sway among tea party activists.

As Saturday's South Carolina primary vote approaches, Gingrich yesterday levelled a forceful new attack on Romney, calling the frontrunner's former private equity firm 'exploitive'.

Gingrich had attacked Bain Capital before, but his comments before a gathering of business leaders in Columbia contained some of his harshest rhetoric yet.

After lagging behind in the Iowa causes 
and the New Hampshire primary, Gingrich is hoping a strong showing in 
the nation's first Southern primary will re-energise his White House 
bid.

As Saturday's South Carolina showdown approaches, a poll yesterday showed that Mitt Romney now enjoys the backing of 37 per cent of Republicans across the U.S.

The Gallup poll followed Monday night's hotly contested GOP presidential candidate debate in Myrtle Beach.

Romney's nearest rivals, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, both polled at 14 per cent each.

He held little back in his criticism of Romney, saying that, in at least some instances, the Bain model has meant 'leverage the game, borrow the money, leave the debt behind and walk off with all the profits.

'Now, I'll let you decide if that's really good capitalism. I think it's exploitive. I think it's not defensible.'

Gingrich continued that what Romney engaged in 'is not venture capital'.

'Venture capital is when you go in and put in your capital and you stick it out,' he said.

Gingrich has faced rebuke in some quarters as attacking the GOP bedrock of free enterprise in his criticism of Romney and Bain.

But he argued yesterday that raising questions about Romney's track record at Bain should not be confused with an attack on capitalism.

He said: 'I'm proud of real capitalists. I'm proud of guys who say to their workers I'm in it with you. If I lose money and you lose a job we lost together because we both tried.'

Earlier in the day, Gingrich said at a town hall meeting in West Columbia that a Muslim-American seeking office in the U.S. would have to publicly renounce Islamic law to receive his backing.

When asked if he could support a Muslim for office, the former House speaker replied that it 'would depend entirely on whether the person would commit in public to give up sharia,' or Islamic law.

Gingrich said he is totally opposed to Islamic law and supports a federal law that would pre-empt it.

'A truly modern person who worshipped Allah would not be a threat,' he said.
