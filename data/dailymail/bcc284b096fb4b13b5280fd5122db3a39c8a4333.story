Australian celebrities are used to topping the charts, but now they're making the list for all the wrong reasons.

Searching for pictures of certain Aussie celebrities could pose a  threat to you other than your significant other catching you in the act- typing in high profile names could actually infect your computer.

A new study has revealed the names that are most likely to infect your computer with a virus, with the top five including Aussie singers Jessica Mauboy, Delta Goodrem and Keith Urban, followed by fellow singer Kylie Minogue and Aussie A-lister Russell Crowe.

Internet users are being warned that viruses can be embedded within the photos or videos, exposing not just the nude photos, but their computers- to harmful malware which could download viruses or collect personal information.

Jessica Mauboy topped the list of 'riskiest name', with a 12.2% risk of returning malicious software to the device it was searched from.

Jessica received a profile boost over the past year, appearing on the internationally acclaimed Eurovision

Following the recent scandal over leaked nude pictures of many high-profile Hollywood stars, in which over 100 celebrities fell victim to the phone hacking scandal, internet security experts are warning that cyber-criminals are capitalising on increased traffic by loading related websites with harmful viruses, spyware, phishing and spam.

1. Jessica Mauboy: 12.2%

2. Delta Goodrem: 11%

3. Keith Urban: 10.9%

4. Kylie Minogue: 10.7%

5. Russell Crowe: 10.6%

6. Mel Gibson: 9.2%

7. Guy Pearce: 9.1%

8. Jesse Spencer: 8.8%

9. Eric Bana: 8.3%

10. Rebel Wilson: 8.2%

This isn't just a warning, either.

In early September, an internet provider in New Zealand experienced a nationwide outage for two days after a large number of users attempted to access nude pictures of Jennifer Lawrence.

The links promising the photos appeared to have hijacked the users' computers and bombarded websites with large amounts of internet traffic, causing the sites to crash.  

In order to avoid a repeat of what some have labelled 'breaking the internet,' internet experts have compiled a list of the most dangerous names to sneak a cyber peak at.

Within Australia, Jessica Mauboy topped the list of 'riskiest name', with a 12.2% risk of returning malicious software to the device it was searched from. 

Australian singer/songwriter and television personality Delta Goodrem is number two on the list, with an 11% chance of returning a malicious website.

Jessica received a profile boost over the past year, appearing on the internationally acclaimed Eurovision, and appearing at the handover ceremony at the Commonwealth games in Scotland. 

Appearing alongside international comedy man Chris O'Dowd in 2012 in the film 'The Sapphires', Jessica's international profile is on the rise, and so is her related web risk.

Australian singer/songwriter and television personality Delta Goodrem is number two on the list, with an 11% chance of returning a malicious website.

Delta, who is a judge on Australia's The Voice, is well-known for her highly publicised romances with Brian McFadden, Mark Philippoussis, and Jonas' Brothers Nick Jonas.

Her recent interaction with Marlon Wayans on Twitter and Instagram put her profile on a global scale.  

After Wayans posted a photo of Delta at a Beyonce and Jay-Z concert, labeling her an 'unrhythmic white woman', she responded by tweeting a video of 'The Elaine Dance'.

Her tweet scored 779 re-tweets and 1,272 favourites on the social media site, pushing her related web risk sky high. 

Receiving bronze is Australian singer and husband of Nicole Kidman, Keith Urban, appearing on the list for the first time with a danger risk of 10.9%.

Keith and his wife have made headlines over the past year amid gossip that their marriage was struggling, and more recently, throughout the high-profile funeral of Nicole's father.

The 'American Idol' panelist has recently completed a national tour for his 8th studio album 'Light the Fuse', winning a spate of awards at the Country Music Awards in 2014.

Other Aussies to make the list include Kylie Minogue with 10.7% and Russell Crowe with 10.6%. 

On a global scale, Jimmy Kimmell, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jon Bon Jovi all pose significant risks for returning harmful software to a computer.

'The recent high-profile hacking shows just how influential celebrities are around the world, and rightly or wrongly, the incident caused a massive spike in searches, even 'breaking the internet' in New Zealand,' said Sean Duca, Chief Technology Officer for McAfee Asia Pacific. 

'We know that cyber criminals will continue to gain from this by luring curious users with bogus websites, downloads and files, so we all need to be sure of the sites we can continue to trust and do everything we can to protect both our technology and our own personal information from being compromised,' he said. 

It remains to be seen how much internet users are willing to risk for a glimpse at a celebrity, nude or otherwise. 

On a global scale, Jimmy Kimmell, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jon Bon Jovi all pose significant risks for returning harmful software to a computer.
