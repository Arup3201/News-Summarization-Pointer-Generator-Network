He's evaded police since November, but Anthony James Lescowitch Jr. was finally nabbed yesterday - after sharing a wanted picture of himself on his own Facebook page.

Freeland Police Department hunted Lescowitch for two months over allegations he assaulted a man in July last year, before posting the wanted bulletin on their Facebook about 9.20pm yesterday.

When the Pennsylvania man unwittingly shared the bulletin on his own page about three minutes later, undercover cops baited him.

Social media trap: Anthony James Lescowitch Jr., wanted by police since November over an alleged assault, was finally nabbed yesterday after he shared a wanted picture of himself on his own Facebook page

'lol i f***** love it': Police say Lescowitch mocked and taunted police when he shared the post (pictured), with his Facebook friends wishing him luck and even offering to drive him to the station

According to Timesleader.com, police believe the 35-year-old father mocked police with the post, under which he commented, 'lol i f***** love it,  A**HOLE'.

A handful of his Facebook 'friends' also commented, wishing him luck and jokingly offering him a ride. The post got one like.

Police, not believing their luck, used Facebook to lure Lescowitch to them.

Posing as an attractive woman, one of the investigating officers, T.J. Rentschler, began chatting online with Lescowitch about his wanted picture.

Over about 30 minutes, the 'woman' was able to gather key information about Lescowitch which led to his arrest.

The undercover cop invited Lescowitch to meet for a drink.

When the fugitive declined, the cop said:  'The least you can do is come out and have a cigarette with me.'

Lescowitch agreed and when he pulled up in a car at the specified location, cops arrested him.

He admitted he also used to steal from his parents, his young
