With the desperate search
 to find missing 8-year-old Relisha Rudd stalling on Thursday, police 
have said they want answers from the girl's mother and her boyfriend about 
her recent unusual activity.

Three weeks after her daughter when missing, 
Shamika Young had still insisted Relisha was safe and she had stalled 
social workers who wanted to issue an alert that the girl was missing.

A Grand Jury is now looking into whether Young may have obstructed justice by misleading police. School absences led authorities to only start looking for Relisha on March 19, although she was last seen on March 1.

In the days after Relisha was last seen alive, Young's boyfriend Antonio Wheeler posted pictures on Facebook of large rolls of $50 bills and photos of Air Jordan sneakers bought for Relisha's three brothers

In the days after Relisha was last seen alive, Young's boyfriend Antonio Wheeler posted a series of photos on Facebook of him holding large rolls of $50 bills and photos of Air Jordan sneakers bought for Relisha's three brothers.

At the same time, the family was living in a homeless shelter, reports WUSA9.

Police
 said on Thursday that they have concluded their search of a large 
Washington park where they thought they might find the missing girl's 
body.

Police in the nation's
 capital began searching Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens for Relisha Rudd 
last week. Chief Cathy Lanier said that police had not found any clues 
as to where Relisha could be.

Police
 began searching the park after learning that a janitor Relisha was last
 seen with March 1 had spent time in the park the next day after 
purchasing trash bags.

Though police didn't find Relisha during the search, they did find the body of the janitor, Kahlil Tatum.

Tatum was a janitor at the homeless shelter where she lived with her mother and brothers.

Police
 believe Young let Kahlil Tatum take Relisha, and she was last seen 
alive with him weeks before police say he killed his wife and then 
himself.

Police stopped searching Kenilworth Park Aquatic Gardens in Washington DC for Relisha Rudd on Thursday

Relisha's mother had allowed her to spend
 time with Tatum, and her family did not report her missing. Repeated 
absences from school led authorities to start looking for her March 19.

Only
 after Relisha was reported missing did police in neighboring Prince 
George's County, Md., find the body of Tatum's wife in a motel room, 
with the FBI releasing a nation-wide wanted poster.

Police
 are now reviewing surveillance video from March 1 forward at Union 
Station in an attempt to determine if someone had put Relisha on a train
 to a destination still unknown.

The FBI is still offering a $25,000 reward for Relisha's return.

This wanted poster for Kahlil Malik Tatum was posted after the body of his wife was found in a Maryland hotel. Police say they cannot rule out the possibility Tatum murdered Relisha Rudd before he killed himself
