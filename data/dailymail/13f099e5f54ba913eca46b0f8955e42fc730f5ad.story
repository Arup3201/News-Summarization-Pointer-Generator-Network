Over fifty years have passed since her death, but the appeal of Hollywood icon Marilyn Monroe is as enduring as ever.

Her short but stellar life - she died in 1962 at the age of 36 - saw her make 29 films, pose for countless photographers and even sing on stage for the U.S. President.

Now, her colourful career, from model to movie star, has been charted in a collection of memorabilia that is going on display alongside other iconic items.

Red alert: The dress which was worn by Marilyn Monroe in 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' makes up part of a collection of memorabilia from popular culture from the David Gainsborough Roberts collection, which will be on display at Christie's Auction House

Iconic dress: Monroe's red sequinned evening gown worn for her role as Lorelei Lee in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, right, is among the costumes which will be shown until September 2

A gown worn on screen by the blonde bombshell and the desert robes of TE Lawrence are among the notable artefacts going on public display from a memorabilia collection drawing together items which span more than 150 years.

Monroe's red sequinned evening gown worn for her role as Lorelei Lee in the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is among the costumes which will be shown until September 2. 

A dazzling pair of earrings, which were worn by Marilyn  in 'How to Mary a Millionaire' in 1953, also make up the collection.

Speaking about the exhibition, David Gainsborough Roberts said: 'In 1989 I bought a Marilyn Monroe film costume from Christie’s and my life changed completely. 

'Although I have always been a collector of antiques since before I could read or write, that day in 1989 brought out the serious collector in me. Although I have put on dozens of exhibitions worldwide, this is my first one with Christie’s. 

'I hope all you fellow collectors enjoy this small selection of highlights from my collection.'
