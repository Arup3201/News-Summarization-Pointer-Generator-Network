Ed Miliband yesterday dropped any mention of Britain’s vast budget deficit, immigration and welfare from his final party conference speech before the General Election.

Instead, the Labour leader put an assault on the wealthy and more cash for the NHS at the heart of a statist bid for power.

Retreating to his party’s old comfort zone, the Labour leader railed against owners of expensive homes, bankers, Tories, energy and tobacco companies and the media.

Ed Miliband dropped any mention of Britain’s vast budget deficit, immigration and welfare from his final party conference speech before the General Election. Aides said the speech ‘changed’ as it was being delivered

After the speech, Miliband attempted to kiss his wife Justine who pulled away but later managed to get it right

Last night it emerged that he had either ditched or forgotten to deliver a planned section promising to ‘get the deficit down’ and ‘no proposals for additional borrowing’. 

Extracts of his address released in advance to favoured journalists also revealed he had been expected to promise to make immigrants ‘learn English and earn their way’, but failed to do so.

On welfare, Mr Miliband also neglected to say that all who can work ‘have a responsibility to do so’. Aides said the speech, delivered without notes, had ‘changed’ as it was being delivered.

In what was widely seen as a lacklustre appearance at the conference in Manchester, which he described as the start of a ‘job interview’ to become Prime Minister, he sketched out a vision for a decade in Downing Street.

While the Conservatives told people ‘you’re on your own’, the Labour leader said that if elected he would seek to fashion an interventionist state based on something he called ‘the principle of together’. 

He said he would tax tobacco companies, owners of valuable properties and hedge funds to raise £2.5 billion to pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 extra GPs, 5,000 careworkers and 3,000 midwives.

A ‘mansion tax’ would be introduced on more than 100,000 homes worth more than £2 million.

Businesses would be required to pay a minimum wage of £8 an hour by 2020, big banks ‘broken up’ and firms that want government contracts made to take on apprentices. 

Developers will no longer be allowed to ‘sit on land’, which will be released for housebuilding, ‘cruel and vindictive’ cuts to housing benefit will be reversed and all electricity required to be environmentally friendly by 2030.

Miliband went in for a kiss with his wife Justine but had to brush it off when she accidentally moved away

The pair joked about the mishap before later having a quick peck in front of the clapping crowd and cameras

The House of Lords will be scrapped and replaced with a ‘National Senate of the Nations and the Regions’ and 16- and 17-year-olds will be given the vote.

‘Friends, it is time we ran the country like we know it can be run,’ Mr Miliband said in the 68-minute speech. 

The Labour leader, who used the word ‘together’ 47 times, said he aimed to ‘restore people’s faith in the future’. 

‘I’m not talking about changing a policy, or simply a different programme. But something that is bigger: transforming the idea, the ethic, of how our country is run.

‘What people across England, Scotland and Wales, across every part of the UK, are saying is this country doesn’t care about me. Politics doesn’t listen. 

'The economy doesn’t work. And they are not wrong. They are right. But this Labour Party has a plan to put it right.’

Mr Miliband also reeled off a list of people and organisations he said he had ‘stood up to’, including Rupert Murdoch over phone hacking, banks over bonuses, payday lenders and energy companies over their profits and the Daily Mail when it ran an article about his father’s views.

After the speech, the Labour leader was forced to brush off an embarrassing mishap after moving in to kiss wife Justine - who pulled away at the crucial moment.

The gaffe occurred when he brought her to the centre of the stage to wave to the crowd and cameras.

The pair managed to laugh off the mishap and later had a peck on the lips to make up for it.

Last night Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk said Mr Miliband appeared to have a ‘mental block’ on immigration and welfare.

‘He talks a lot in his speech about meeting Gareth and Josephine and others in the park or the pub,’ he said. ‘It seems strange that none of them he’s met have mentioned immigration and welfare.

‘You do wonder if he has a mental block about talking about these issues.’

Chancellor George Osborne said it was ‘extraordinary’ Mr Miliband ‘didn’t mention the deficit once’. ‘If you can’t fix the economy you can’t fund the NHS,’ he added.

Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the union Unite, Labour’s biggest financial backer, was delighted with Mr Miliband’s speech. ‘The keys of No 10 are within his grasp,’ he said.

But Grant Shapps, the Conservative party chairman, said: ‘All Ed Miliband offers is more wasteful spending, more borrowing and more taxes. 

'You can’t fund the NHS if you lose control of the nation’s finances and bankrupt the economy like Labour did last time.’

A Labour government will hit thousands of pubs and clubs with a late-night-opening tax – in a blunt admission of the chaos caused by its 24-hour drinking laws. 

Yesterday Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said drinking venues in some areas which want to open beyond midnight will be forced to pay up to £4,400 a year extra.

The party leader, who used the word ‘together’ 47 times, said he aimed to ‘restore people’s faith in the future’

Aides said Mr Miliband's speech, which was given without notes, had ‘changed’ as it was being delivered

Ed Miliband has an approval rating of minus 23 per cent, making him the most unpopular since Foot

Ed Miliband is the most unpopular opposition leader in the run-up to a General Election since Michael Foot, polls have shown.

Mr Foot is the only politician in the past 40 years to have a worse rating than Mr Miliband 12 months ahead of an election, according to researchers Ipsos Mori.

Mr Miliband is languishing with an approval rating of minus 23 per cent. At this point before the 2010 election, David Cameron had an approval rating of plus 23 per cent.

Only those leaders with positive approval ratings – Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and Mr Cameron – went on to become Prime Minister, while all those with negative ratings lost the election.

Confronted with the appalling figures for Labour on BBC’s Newsnight, the party’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt claimed that he wasn’t concerned.

‘The great thing about being in Ed Miliband’s team is that we’re in the history-busting business,’ he said.

It was reported yesterday that Mr Miliband suspects anti-semitism may be behind some of the hostility towards him.
