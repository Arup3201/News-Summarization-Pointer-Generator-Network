Squatters should be encouraged because they bring empty homes back into use, a judge said yesterday.

Fiona Henderson ruled they were not criminals and there was no evidence they carried out more anti-social behaviour than rent-paying tenants.

Her judgment is a blow to the thousands every year who see their homes invaded – and struggle through the courts to win them back.

Trashed: Julia High fell victim to squatters when she went on holiday, returning to find a family of gypsies in her home in Leytonstone, east London, who invited her in for a glass of her own wine

Yet the judge dismissed claims that 
squatting victims faced high costs and that those occupying council or 
housing association properties were queue jumpers.

She ordered a list of empty homes in 
North London to be made public to the Advisory Service for Squatters, an
 East London-based organisation known as the ‘estate agency for 
squatters’.

The group, run by Yiannis Voyias, 
publishes details of empty homes and a handbook showing how to take full
 advantage of housing laws.

It came as a surgeon and his wife begged 
squatters to leave their new London home amid fears the stress could 
complicate the birth of their first child, who is due tomorrow,

Blocked: Oliver and Kaltun Cockerell were due to move into a house in West Hampstead, London, when a group of 11 squatters took over. The legal move by the tribunal judge gives even more opportunities to squatters

Oliver and Kaltun Cockerell were due to move into the house in West Hampstead when the group of 11 squatters took over.

The couple offered them £500 to move out but they demanded more. The couple will go to court today seeking an eviction order.

It also followed the trashing of Julia High's home when she went on holiday, returning to find a family of gypsies in her home in Leytonstone, east London

Judge Henderson’s ruling that 
squatting is a good thing and not a crime comes as Justice Secretary Ken
 Clarke considers laws that would finally make squatting a criminal 
offence.

Proposals include prison sentences for
 persistent squatters such as Mr Voyias and the repeal of ‘squatters’ 
rights’ rules that prevent owners using force to take back their 
properties.

A list of empty state-owned properties
 and private homes owned by companies or trusts rather than individuals 
in Camden must be provided to the Advisory Service under Judge 
Henderson’s ruling at the Information Rights Tribunal.

Blighted communities: Police believe there is a link between squatting and crimes such as vandalism, crack houses and threatening behaviour

Judge Henderson heard evidence from 
Camden Council that almost all squatting involves criminal damage, that 
squatters jump the queue for scarce public housing and that police link 
squatting with vandalism, drugs and threatening behaviour.

The council’s lawyers argued that 
disclosing the addresses to Mr Voyias under Freedom of Information law 
would compromise efforts to prevent and detect crime.

But Judge Henderson said: ‘Squatting is not a crime.’

She said the release of the list could
 have ‘a negative impact’ on crime prevention and might be of use to 
organised criminals looking to burgle and gut empty homes.

But the judge said: ‘The tribunal does
 not consider that any perceived social disadvantage of living next door
 to squatters, or the costs of eviction of squatters, are matters that 
the tribunal is entitled to take into consideration since squatting is 
not illegal.’

No social disadvantage: There is a lack of evidence proving that squatters were the source of more anti-social behaviour than rent-paying tenants

She added that, although the list 
would be of use to professional squatters, its disclosure was unlikely 
to increase the drink or drug-fuelled opportunistic crime associated 
with empty properties.

Judge Henderson said that if squatters
 were able to jump the queue for housing, this would have no bearing on 
the prevention of crime.

She added: ‘There is evidence of some buildings remaining void for many years while planning and funding issues are resolved.

‘The Tribunal is satisfied that publication of this list would  bring a proportion of the void 
properties back into use earlier than would otherwise be the case and 
that, consequently, this is a strong public interest in favour  of 
disclosure.’

Judge Henderson said she accepted that
 disclosure of the list would ‘facilitate squatting and associated 
crime’, that this would cost public money to  prevent and that ‘the 
feeling of security of people living in  neighbouring houses’ would be 
undermined.

Meanwhile, more empty homes are to be taken over by councils to tackle a national housing shortage.

The move will help the homeless and protect the green belt, according to Local Government Minister Bob Neill.

Mr Neill, a Tory, said he would step up the ‘empty dwelling management orders’ brought in by Labour in 2006.

‘In the five years they’ve been in 
force, there have been only 46 orders, and that contrasts with the 
300,000 empty homes,’ he said.
