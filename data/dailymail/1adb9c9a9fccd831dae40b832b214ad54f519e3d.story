Time columnist and CNN TV host Fareed Zakaria has been suspended from both news organizations for plagiarizing an article in magazine the New Yorker.

Zakaria, who writes and serves as editor-at-large for Time magazine, apologized after several paragraphs were found lifted from an article published in the New Yorker for use in his Time column.

Both Time and CNN, who also noticed similarities in a blog post he wrote for their website, have suspended him for a month.

Zakaria said in a statement on Friday he made 'a terrible mistake,' adding: 'It is a serious lapse and one that is entirely my fault.'

CNN’s choice to suspend their foreign-affairs anchor and the face to their programme ‘GPS’ acknowledged a similar article he wrote for CNN.com using the same material lifted from New Yorker writer Jill Lepore’s piece published in April.

'He wrote a shorter blog post on CNN.com on the same issue which included similar unattributed excerpts. That blog post has been removed and CNN has suspended Fareed Zakaria while this matter is under review,' CNN stated.

In a separate statement, Time spokesman Ali Zelenko said the magazine accepts Zakaria's apology, but would suspend his column for one month, 'pending further review.'

'What he did violates our own standards for our columnists, which is that their work must not only be factual but original; their views must not only be their own but their words as well,' Zelenko said.

Media reporters had previously noted similarities between passages in Zakaria's column about gun control that appeared in Time's Aug. 20 issue as well.

In Zakaria's column, titled 'The Case for Gun Control,' he began one paragraph with the sentences:

'Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at UCLA, documents the actual history in `Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.' Guns were regulated in the U.S. from the earliest years of the Republic.'

A corresponding passage in Lenore's essay, titled 'Battleground America,' begins: ‘As Adam Winkler, a constitutional-law scholar at U.C.L.A., demonstrates in a remarkably nuanced new book, `Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,' firearms have been regulated in the United States from the start.'

In Zakaria's statement, he apologized 'unreservedly' to Lepore, as well as to his editors and readers.

Zakaria also serves as a Washington Post columnist.
