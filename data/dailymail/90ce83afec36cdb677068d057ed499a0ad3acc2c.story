Getting back to nature resulted in Sydney photographer David Stefanoff bringing some of Australia's most recognisable faces to life by projecting them onto trees and rocks.

'The photographic journey was a way of getting away from the computer and into Sydney parks,' Stefanoff told Daily Mail Australia.

'A photo is the finished product but there's everything else between - this was a way to spend a lot of time reconnecting with nature.'

Bringing nature to life: Sydney photographer creates stunning portraits using trees as a backdrop

The collection of faces in the series were complied of Stefanoff's idols and people he respects, including  co-founder of fashion label Alpha-60 Georgie Cleary, pictured left, and skateboarder James McInnes

While almost all of the portraits were projected onto trees, one of the most recognisable faces in the series, that of TV host Andrew Denton, appeared on a giant piece of coastal rock between Bondi and Tamarama in Sydney's eastern suburbs

The 39-year-old Bondi-based artist's early experiments with projections were inspired by Sydney's Vivid festival and resulted in the spectacular series called Photosynthesis.

'Projecting onto a tree was an accident,' he said. 'It was one of the different surfaces I was trying and I ended up liking it because the trees, the shape you get when you project portraits, fill up the tree.'

But the stunning photographic transformations all started in the same way, with some of Stefanoff's idols agreeing to be photographed in black and white images taken in a studio.

Among the famous faces embedded in the natural forms during dusk and night include are media personality Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, TV presenter Andrew Denton, Triple J radio presenter Zane Rowe as well as a mix of fashion designers, tattooists, skateboarders and musicians.

'They are the people I admire and regard,' the photographer said of his portrait subjects.

Stefanoff used a long exposure technique to capture the projections. 'Depending on what you project on, it picks up the colour and texture of the surface,' he said.

Trees were Stefanoff's preferred object to project onto and created more natural and organic forms compared to rocks. 'I wanted the people to look like them,' he said.

'It's quite an abstract portrait so it helps to have recognisable faces so people can spot people they know and go "wow I've seen that person before, they look different".'

'You see familiar faces in a different context and for subjects who are often photographed, it shows them differently from normal.'

Designer Terry Gillespie said he was happy to be involved in the series and was pleased with the finished result after seeing his profile projected onto bush in North Bondi

Many of the locations Stefanoff chose to project the portraits are also recognisable, including spots in Centennial Park in Sydney and coastal rocks between Bondi and Tamarama in Sydney's eastern suburbs, close to where the artist's home.

Stefanoff also took images at Lennox Head on the NSW north coast while visiting family and areas in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where he regularly goes for evening walks. 'That's how I got kick started,' he said.

Sydney web designer and developer Terry Gillespie was featured in the series and said he loved the finished result.

'I was pretty happy to be involved... I had seen some of his other work,' Mr Gillespie said.

Stefanoff said his work's name Photosynthesis was a play on words, as trees normally turn light into energy, but he was using light to create an image.

Stefanoff uses the textures of the trees to give the portraits depth and an organic feel, including that storyteller and performer Jane Tyrrell, projected onto palm trees in Bondi
