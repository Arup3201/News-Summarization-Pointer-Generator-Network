Britain has asked Indonesia not to press for the death penalty in the case of an ex-PCSO accused of trafficking crystal meth just days after the start of her trial.

Andrea Ruth Waldeck was hooded as she was brought into court to face charges of possessing £12,000 worth of crystal methamphetamine, from which the drug Ice is made.

She is alleged to have passed through the city airport after a flight from China with 1.4 kilograms of drugs hidden in her underwear and strapped to her body.

Andrea Waldeck, 43, was arrested by detectives 
who said they searched her hotel room and found crystal methamphetamine worth 
£3,000 taped to her stomach

Police allege they found the drugs when they raided her hotel room.

In a letter to Miss Waldeck's lawyer, which has also been passed to prosecutors, the embassy asked for leniency.

'We have received an official letter from the British Embassy in Jakarta requesting prosecutors reconsider the death penalty request for Andrea. Further, in order to strengthen the argument, the embassy will send an official to testify in Andrea’s favour,' her lawyer Mr Oktavianto Prasongko told The Jakarta Post.

He said the embassy would present the facts regarding Miss Waldeck's role as a community police officer and social worker who dealt with drug addicts while serving in the UK.

'Most important is the fact she has never been involved with any crime while serving and living in her country,' said Mr Oktavianto.

Prosecutor Mr Deddy Agus Oktavianto has already asked the court for a mandatory death sentence for the British woman,

Police are still hunting for an Indonesian man and Miss Waldeck's Nigerian boyfriend, identified only as Joe.

She told authorities that she was ordered to deliver 3lb (1.47kg) of the highly addictive drug, known as crystal meth, by her boyfriend. 

She was arrested in April after tip off to police.

Until February last year, she worked for Gloucestershire Police.

After leaving her job, Waldeck crossed the globe to become part of what prosecutors alleged to be  an ‘evil conspiracy’ involving an Indonesian drug-smuggling gang.

If convicted, she will become the second British woman facing the firing squad in Indonesia for drug-smuggling.

Grandmother Lindsay Sandiford was sentenced to death in January after cocaine worth an estimated £1.6millon was found in the lining of her suitcase.

Waldeck was declared bankrupt in 2009 with debts of more than £120,000.

Prosecutors say she initially evaded customs officials at Juanda Airport while hiding four packets of drugs in her underwear.

She was arrested in April at her hotel room in 
Surabaya, Indonesia’s second largest city, after police received a 
tip-off.

Officers raided her room after she rang an associate in China 
to arrange for someone to pick up the crystal meth, it is alleged.

Her trial began this week at Surabaya district court and Waldeck is expected to give a statement next Monday.

Last month Indonesia's Supreme Court upheld the death sentence for grandmother Lindsay Sandiford

Her brother Mark Waldeck, of Brecon, 
Powys, said yesterday: ‘We don’t want to talk about it until the trial 
is over.’

He said his sister is being assisted by London-based legal 
charity Reprieve.

The British Embassy has been aware of Waldeck’s case since shortly after her arrest and has provided consular assistance.
