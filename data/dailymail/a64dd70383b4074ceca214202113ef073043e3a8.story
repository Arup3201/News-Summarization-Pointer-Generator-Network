Team news

Swansea 

Swansea are waiting on international clearance for Argentina defender Federico Fernandez to feature against Burnley on Saturday.

Fernandez completed his £8million switch from Italian club Napoli on Wednesday but Swansea are still waiting for the paperwork for the 25-year-old to make his debut.

New man in: Swansea are waiting on international clearance for Federico Fernandez before he can play for Garry Monk's side following his £8million arrival from Napoli on Wednesday

Even if Fernandez is cleared to play he may still not start as manager Garry Monk could opt to name the same side which shocked Manchester United at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the season. Swansea are still without Leon Britton, Marvin Emnes and Jay Fulton, all with knee injuries.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Taylor, Amat, Williams, Ki, Shelvey, Dyer, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Tiendalli, Montero, Gomis, Bartley, Fernandez, Richards, Sheehan, King, Kingsley.

Burnley

Striker Sam Vokes remains Burnley's only absentee as they travel to Swansea on Saturday.

The Wales international remains sidelined with anterior cruciate ligament damage but the Clarets have everyone else available, including new signing Stephen Ward.

Long term absentee: Burnley are only without striker Sam Vokes, who has been out injured since March

The Republic of Ireland international will compete with Ben Mee for the left-back position and can also operate in midfield.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Ward, Duff, Shackell, Mee, Wallace, Marney, Ings, Kightly, Jones, Taylor, Sordell, Reid, Jutkiewicz, Gilks, Long, Barnes, Hewitt, Arfield.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Swansea’s Ashley Williams scored an own goal in the last meeting of these sides back in 2011.

This will be the first time Swansea and Burnley have met in the top-flight; they have met previously in the second, third and fourth tiers of English football.

Only one of Gylfi Sigurdsson's eight Premier League goals for Swansea has come at home

Swansea conceded the most fouls on the opening weekend (20), Burnley the fewest (6).

Swansea are looking to win three Premier League games in a row for the first time since August 2012.

Room for improvement: Burnley's only ever Premier League away win came in the 4-1 thrashing of Hull in April 2010. Graham Alexander (centre) celebrates scoring the Clarets' second goal

The Swans have kept only one clean sheet in their last six Premier League home games.

Burnley lost fewer away games (3) than any other team in the Championship last season.

In their previous Premier League campaign (2009-10), Burnley took only four points away from home (W1 D1 L17)

Burnley’s record of 13 per cent of their points coming away from home in 2009-10 is the lowest proportion in a single Premier League season.

Wilfried Bony has scored five goals in his last five Premier League appearances.
