An Orthodox Jewish real estate developer was allegedly kidnapped, taped up and thrown into a van outside his Brooklyn office in the midst of the blizzard late on Thursday night.

The family of Menachem Stark, 40, offered a $100,000 'no questions asked' reward for his safe return on Friday, as police combed through surveillance video that appears to show his abduction.

Officers say the incident happened at around 11.20pm, when Stark was grabbed by two men on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg. Some reports suggest he was carrying $4,000 in cash.

Missing: Police are looking for Jewish Orthodox real estate developer Menachem Stark, who was allegedly kidnapped from outside his office in Willliamsburg on Thursday night

Hunt: Police and the Willliamsburg community are looking for clues on the light-colored Dodge minivan (circled) which Stark appears to have been bundled into

DNA Info reported that Stark was approached and manhandled into a light-colored van by two men as he left his office at Southside Associates at 331 Rutledge Street.

His wife Bashie apparently became concerned when Stark did not return after midnight and contacted Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the Orthodox community.

Surveillance footage was then discovered in Stark's office that shows a struggle with one man, before the van pulls up and he is wrestled by two men into the vehicle.

Stark's brothers Yitzy and Yoely told the New York Post: 'We saw two people fighting with him, and they put him into a big white van, a Dodge Caravan,' Yitzy, 30, said.

The brothers described Menachem's alleged attackers to the Post as 'big' and 'black.'

The New York Daily News reported that Stark was carrying $4,000 in cash, but Yitzy Stark denied this when he offered the six-figure reward for his brother's return.

'We're waiting for a phone call with demands. [We're] just hoping that he is still alive,' Yitzy told DNA Info. 'We'll do anything they ask.'

Shomrim reportedly informed the NYPD of the incident at around 2.30 a.m. on Friday. Both the police and the community are now looking for clues on the white Dodge minivan.

Officials spent the day in the local area conducting interviews and reviewing surveillance footage from local businesses.

The Real Deal claimed that Stark, and associate Israel Perlmutter, were being sued more than $51 million in 2011, over loans for development projects in Williamsburg and Greenpoint.

And a number of tenants who claimed to live in properties owned by Southside Associates have left a number of angry complaints on sites such as Yelp about the condition and maintenance of the apartments, also describing Stark as a 'slumlord.'

One user wrote: 'These people are absolutely terrible. It's as though they have no hearts and no compassion for anyone else. All they seem to care about is their bank account.'

Yitzy Stark described his brother to the Daily News as 'a good man, a great man.' 'Nobody around here would say anything bad about him,' he added.
