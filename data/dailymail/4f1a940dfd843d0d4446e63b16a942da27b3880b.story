Cocaine and heroin are smuggled into jails on an almost daily basis, shocking new figures show.

Hard drugs, knives and mobile phones were among contraband seized in prisons hundreds of times last year.

Prison guards found cocaine, heroin and knives more than once a day, raising fears about security behind bars.  

Cocaine was found in jails in England and Wales 80 times last year, raising questions about how it ended up in the hands of inmates

New figures reveal the scale of contraband seizures in the nation's prisons in 2013

Ministers insist contraband in prisons is taken ‘extremely seriously’, with new technology used to block mobile phone signals and x-ray scanners used to stop illegal items being smuggled in to prisoners.

But new figures reveal the scale of the problem in jails holding some of Britain’s most serious criminals.

Figures released in Parliament show 352 knives and drugs seizures were made last year, more than one a day.

It included 80 seizures of cocaine, 210 of heroin and at least 62 knives, although the figures did not including details of weapons found in every high security prison.

It includes five heroin seizures and two for cocaine at Wormwood Scrubs, two heroin bundles at Wandsworth prison.

G4S-run Rye Hill prison in Warwickshire, a category B jail holding 664 male inmates, made eight cocaine seizures and nine of heroin.

Forest Bank prison in Salford made the most heroin seizures - 11 - and three of cocaine. The Category B jail holds 1,300 male prisons.

The figures were released in Parliament in response to a parliamentary question by Labour MP Jim Cunningham.

Latest figures on mobile phones, dating from 2012, showed 7,301 handsets or SIM Cards were found, up from 6,756 in 2010.

Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, said: ‘The amount of drugs and knives getting into our prison revealed by this data is alarming.

‘How can we possibly punish and reform criminals if contraband and weapons are circulating so freely in our jails?

‘This needs a concerted effort by ministers to put a stop to this, but with all their cuts to prison staff and the increased overcrowding and violence on their watch in our prisons, I’ve not got much confidence they’re up to it.’

The Ministry of Justice insisted that anyone caught with illegal contraband in jail will face tough penalties.

Justice minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘National Offender Management Service, which runs jails in England and Wales, takes the issue of all contraband in prisons extremely seriously and deploys a comprehensive range of robust searching and security measures to detect items of contraband both at the point of entry to the prison and concealed within the prison.

‘These include targeted searching, random and targeted mandatory drug tests, the use of x-ray machines and CCTV surveillance cameras, Body Orifice Security Scanners to detect contraband secreted internally, and the imposition of closed (non-contact) visits.

‘Prisoners found with prohibited items face swift and robust punishment. This can include having days added to their custody, being transferred to a different prison and losing privileges.’
