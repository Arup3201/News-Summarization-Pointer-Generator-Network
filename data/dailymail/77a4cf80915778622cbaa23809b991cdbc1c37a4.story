But Barlow, who has not posted anything on his account since May, has now returned - with his first Tweets apologising to his fans for the stories regarding his tax avoidance, followed by a vow to 'settle things'

Up till now he has kept rather quiet about the controversy surrounding his financial dealings.

But Gary Barlow has finally broken his four-month silence over his tax avoidance with an apology … and a plug for his new album.

The Take That singer was accused of ‘cynicism’ as he addressed the issue in a series of messages to his 3.5million Twitter followers.

Barlow said he was sorry ‘to anyone who was offended by the tax stories’. But some fans said it fell short of heartfelt contrition as he did not express regret for the fact he failed to pay tax.

And alongside the cursory apology, he announced that the band have been working on a new record.

Earlier this year it was revealed the 43-year-old, his bandmates Howard Donald, 46, and Mark Owen, 42, and their manager Jonathan Wild face a multimillion-pound tax bill for attempting to shelter £66million in a tax-avoidance scheme called Icebreaker.

Days after the revelations, Barlow’s Twitter account was hacked by someone who wrote an offensive post about his stillborn baby, prompting him to stay off the social networking site.

Returning to Twitter for the first time since May 7, the star said: ‘Hey everyone! I’m back from seven productive weeks in the US and I’m back on Twitter! I’ve had a break from Twitter after someone hacked my account and some very upsetting and disturbing text was written.

‘Over the summer I’ve remembered that I have so many supporters, friends and fans on here so why let 1 person ruin all the fun.

‘I want to apologise to anyone who was offended by the tax stories earlier this year. With a new team of accountants we are working to settle things with all parties involved ASAP.’

Last
 night, MPs welcomed the apology, but said it should have come sooner 
and questioned whether he would now pay back the tax he managed to avoid
 through the Icebreaker scheme.

Tory
 MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘There is no free pass for people who abuse 
our tax system. Increasingly they will be found out, have to pay their 
fair share and risk public anger to boot. It’s welcome to see Gary 
Barlow putting his hand up.

'But he could have held it up a little higher
 and sooner than he has.’

Labour
 MP John Mann added: ‘We all look forward to him confirming that he will
 pay back all the tax that he avoided.’ And moments after the posts 
about his tax affairs, Barlow started plugging his new ventures: ‘We 
have been working since the new year on a new Take That studio album.

'We
 are extremely excited about it! It has been four long years since the 
last one. It’s so nice to be back in the band!’

Many of Barlow’s fans reacted positively to his statement, with one saying: ‘You’re only human and we all make mistakes.’

But
 others questioned the timing of his apology. One said it was ‘hollow’ 
and ‘non-committal’, adding: ‘Only sorry coz [sic] he was named and 
shamed. Timing is to drum up interest for upcoming album. Cynical.’ 
Another added: ‘I wasn’t offended by the stories, I was offended by you 
not paying tax, Gary. Because I have a moral compass.’

Barlow’s
 investment in Icebreaker was first revealed in 2012. This year, a tax 
judge decided it was ‘known and understood by all concerned to be a tax 
avoidance scheme’.

It allowed the Take That members to avoid tax on around £63million made through world tours and CD sales.

There is no suggestion that the other band members, Jason Orange and Robbie Williams, invested in the Icebreaker schemes.
