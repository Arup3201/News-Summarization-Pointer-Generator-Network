The State of Kansas has approved a massive sex toy auction to recoup more than $100,000 dollars in unpaid taxes from a failed chain of sex shops.

Vibrators, handcuffs,lingerie, paddles, ropes, restraints and porn DVDs will be sold off by the boxload Monday in a bid to claw back $163,986 from United Outlets LLC, which operated five erotic stores in Kansas and Missouri.

The sex chain - which traded under the name Bang - owes state authorities for unpaid sales, income and withholding taxes.

The State of Kansas approved a huge sex toy auction, featuring more than 1,250 items, in the hope of raising $163,986 in unpaid tax money. Lots include this 12-inch, leather bound paddle (left), an erotic whip (center) and a beginners S&M kit (right)

Failure to perform: The items were seized by state revenue officers from a chain of five sex stores trading under the name Bang in and around Kansas City

When all other tactics failed to produce the money, Kansas revenue officials raided the business in July, seizing huge amounts of erotic stock from the stores.

The state then struck a deal with business owner Larry Minkoff, who was allowed to set up the auction to amass funds to start paying his debt, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal.

Auction site equip-bid.com is hosting the auction, which will take place on Monday in the West Bottoms region of Kansas City, just past the state line with Missouri.

As well as hosting the huge haul online, potential buyers will be invited to inspect the goods in person on Monday. 

'New and unopened': Some of the equipment on sale is wearable - such as these pouch-style briefs for men(left) and (right) a three-part set of wrist restraints, ankle restraints and a face mask for women (photos posed by models)

Convoluted: This four-way set of handcuffs also featured in the auction, which mingled individual items with massive boxloads of sex equipment

In a message on the site, the auctioneers said: 'There are literally thousands of new items. Adult toys, lingerie, DVDs - you name it. All items are new in their original packaging.'

The auction features more than 1,250 sex-themed lots - a mixture of individual items and whole boxes of erotic equipment.

A lot of around 100 vibrators and other sex paraphernalia had been given offers of $70. 

One box of 404 explicit DVDs was selling for $45, while an electric shock kit was under offer for $53.

Opposition politicians in Kansas have accused the Republican administration of dragging the state into 'the porn business' to balance its books.

Themed: There was plenty of Fifty Shades of Grey-themed merchandise on offer, including copies of the bestselling novels - as well as equipment with a more direct application

The Kansas Senate Democratic leader, Anthony Hensley, launched the attack on Governor Sam Brownback when the auction came to light.

He said: 'Brownback is so desperate to fill the massive hole in the state budget caused by his reckless income tax cuts that the state of Kansas is now in the porn business.

A spokesman for Brownback defended the sale as standard practice.

She said: 'While we do not agree with the type of business involved here, it was nonetheless a legal business that was closed due to failure to pay taxes.

'The state cannot legally destroy the property. Returning the property to the owner would have rewarded the business that violated state tax law. This is the same process used by previous administrations.'
