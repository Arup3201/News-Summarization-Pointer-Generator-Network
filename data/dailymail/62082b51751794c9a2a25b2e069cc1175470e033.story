Leroy J. Toppins went missing on Friday night while playing with siblings in the front yard of his family's home in Washington Court House, Ohio.

His parents worriedly reported him missing after he disappeared about 6pm.

More than 100 locals joined a search for the toddler that lasted all day Saturday.

However at 7pm, the boy's body was found in a pond at an old stone quarry, a short distance from where he was last seen, local network NBC 4.

The quarry had been abandoned for years.

Tragedy: Leroy J. Toppins went missing about 6pm Friday while playing with siblings in the front yard of his family's home in Washington Court House, Ohio. His body was found in an adjacent quarry Saturday night

Scene: After a search spanning almost 24 hours, dive crews found the toddler's body about 7pm Friday in Sugar Creek Stone Quarry, a short distance from the family's house

The property is adjacent to the former Sugar Creek Stone Quarry. 

The quarry had been abandoned for several years.

Search crews had been combing through the area for almost 24 hours, but were hampered by the area's conditions, according to Concord Green Fire Chief Ralph Stegbauer.

'Even the creek lines where the volunteers are working are very steep,' Stegabauer told WHIO.

'A lot of brush, a lot of trees and, of course, this time of year the water is up high so we have a lot of things in the water.'

The boy's body was found about three feet from the pond's shore.

Tragically, officials said the pond wouldn't have been there if it weren't for recent rain. 

No foul play: Police say they have no reason to consider the death of Leroy suspicious, believing he wandered off by himself

Police said the missing two-year-old was found dead in a runoff pond near his house in Fayette County. The quarry was adjacent to his family's home and had been abandoned for years

Police do not believe the death was suspicious.  

'At this point there's nothing to indicate foul play,' Fayette County Sheriff Vernon Stanforth told WLWT5.

'The family has been extremely throughout the process. 

'We believe the child merely just wandered away and got too close to the water. 

'We're never equipped to deal with death regardless of where it is, it's especially troubling when you have a small baby.' 

Washington Court House is a city of about 14,000, located between Cincinnati and Columbus.
