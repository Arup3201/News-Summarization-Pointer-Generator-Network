Million pound holiday: Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud has allegedly booked up three whole resorts for his official visit

Tourists looking forward to a dream holiday in the Maldives have had to change their plans after a Saudi prince reportedly booked out three entire island resorts exclusively for himself.

The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud is understood to have taken over the five-star paradise resorts for nearly a month.

It is believed the 78-year-old heir to the Saudi throne paid £18million ($30million) for the  resorts of Anantara Veli, Naladhu and Anantara Dighu from February 19 to March 15.

According to a report on the website maldivesfinest.com, the Saudi prince was due to arrive in the Maldives with a floating hospital, a luxury yacht and more than 100 bodyguards.

But the last minute booking has upset ‘normal’ holidaymakers who have had their reservations cancelled.

Posting a review on the travel website Trip Advisor, one disgruntled holidaymaker who was due to stay at the Antantara Veli resort, wrote: ‘Our reservation was cancelled with NO notice and we were informed only AFTER we contacted them.

‘Back in December we booked the Anantara Veli in an overwater pool villa for a four night stay in early March.

‘Three weeks prior to our departure we emailed the Anantara Veli to confirm our airport pick up and a few other details.

‘As a result of our email to Anantara and a call to our booking agent we finally learned that the hotel had simply cancelled our reservation and, I assume, those of many others. They did this without apprising us of this cancellation.

‘Here's what Anantara finally told us: In essence they said they now have a booking for the period including 19 February until March 15 which, after negotiations, developed into a request for total private island buyout of Anantara Veli and Naladhu.

'Not "I'm sorry", not "we should have notified you", now "how can we make it up to you". Just "this is now the situation".’

The holidaymaker, going by the name Buford33, said he was offered a ‘less desirable resort’ as an alternative, but he turned this down.

He wrote: ‘The message we took away 
was "to hell with clients who took the time to book in advance if we can
 make more money through a single group, total island booking".’

A
 spokeswoman for the Anantara resorts insisted all their guests were 
happy with the alternative accommodation they had been offered.

She
 said: ‘At Anantara Hotels, Resorts & Spas, the wellbeing of our 
guests is always our primary concern and we consistently seek to address
 and allay any queries or concerns that are brought to our attention.

‘Whilst we are not at liberty to discuss individual reservations or visits, we would like to share that on the rare occasion that a change occurs in the status of a booking, we try our utmost to ensure the guest's satisfaction throughout the process.’

Attempts to book rooms in any of the three Anantara hotels during the period of the Crown Prince's stay were met with a 'fully booked' message on the hotel group's website.

Prince Salman is visiting the Maldives in an offical capacity at the invitation of Abdulla Yameen, president of the Republic of Maldives, the Saudi Arabian Foreign Ministry confirmed earlier this month.

The Saudi Arabian Embassy has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.
