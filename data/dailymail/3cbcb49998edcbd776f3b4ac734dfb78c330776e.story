With melons carefully disguising bosoms and a studio light blocking a bare bottom, a new nude calendar sees Minnesota residents strip off all in the name of charity.

Funds raised from the Au Naturel, Encore 2015 planner will be put towards treatment for 55-year-old Toni Poletes - a community stalwart from the small town of Marine on St. Croix who was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer four years ago.

Doran O'Brien, who appears as Mr November, braced freezing temperatures to be photographed naked in his front yard modeling a pair skies.

Uncorked: Olde Towne Liquors owner Adrian Frannsen stuck to warmer climates and stripped off in his store - He is seen popping open a bottle of champagne, while his wife Mary sits alongside him holding a sign reading: 'A toast to Toni . . . to life'

'I was honored to be asked. It's all about love,' he told KARE News.Olde Towne Liquors owner Adrian Frannsen stuck to warmer climates and de-robed in his store.

 

He is seen popping open a bottle of champagne, while his wife Mary sits alongside him holding a sign reading: 'A toast to Toni . . . to life.'

The couple use balloons to maintain their modesty.

This marks the fourth year that the people of Marine on St. Croix have posed for the naked calendar.

Poletes also makes an appearance, standing   in the auto repair shop she runs with her fiance, John Ostlund.

She appears behind a car door, sporting a cheeky grin in her undressed state. Meanwhile, Ostlund tinkers under the bonnet of the vehicle fully-clothed.

Despite her illness, Poletes wears a smile every day as she welcomes customers into her business.

'People think this is the hub of the city,' she said with a laugh.

Still smiling: Poletes also makes an appearance, standing in the auto repair shop she runs with her fiance, John Ostlund - over the years she has endured 16 rounds of chemotherapy 

For a good cause: In previous years the calendar has helped raise more than $20,000 for Poletes

Over the years she has endured 16 rounds chemotherapy and countless hours of radiation.

Today she is tethered constantly to an oxygen tank.

Due to the cost of treatment she has maxed out her medical insurance. That's where the idea for the calendar came into play.

In previous years it has helped raise more than $20,000 for Poletes.

The idea has roots back to 2006 when, inspired by the movie Calendar Girls' photographer Verna Pitts and graphic artist Jeni O’Brien partnered to produce a calendar to raise money for Jenna Lynn, a teenager battling a rare form of bone cancer.

Following her death in 2008 at the age of 18, Pitt and O'Brien teamed up to help Poletes.

The black and white 2015 calendar is currently for sale at $25.

'This is an amazing testament, to people, how people truly are,' Poletes said of the charity initiative. 

Perfect stocking filler: The yearly planner is currently for sale at $25

Widespread: It has been estimated that more than one in three people will develop cancer at some point in their lifetime
