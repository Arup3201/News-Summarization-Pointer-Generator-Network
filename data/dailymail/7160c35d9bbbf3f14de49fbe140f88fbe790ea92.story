Most of us assume that sex is the last thing on the minds of sleep-deprived new mothers.

But new research suggests that nearly half wait just six weeks after giving birth to rekindle the romance.

Australian researchers found that 41 per cent tried sex within six weeks of giving birth. By 12 weeks, this had risen to 78 per cent and 94 pent by the six-month mark.

Nearly half of first-time mothers wait just six weeks after giving birth to have sex again

Older mothers and those who had undergone Caesarean sections took longer to get their sex lives back on track.

Those who had sex within six weeks of birth were less likely to have undergone surgery or a forceps delivery or suffered an injury such as a cut or a tear during birth.

Forty five per cent of women who had a Caesarean section, and 32 per cent of women who had a forceps-assisted birth resumed sex within six week, compared with 60 per cent who had a normal vaginal delivery.

However, the paper also states that only
about 10 per cent of women having a first baby will achieve a vaginal 
birth without intervention, tear or cut.

The proportion of women having sex 
within six weeks of childbirth is also lower among older mothers; 40 per cent of 30 to 34-year-olds resumed sex
within six weeks, compared to 63 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds.

The research, which was carried out 
by the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, in Victoria, Australia, 
also found that sexual activity was resumed earlier than vaginal sex – 
53 per cent of new mothers resumed some sexual activity within six weeks 
of giving birth.

The study was published in the leading journal BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

The NHS does not give a recommended 
waiting time after birth – it suggests that new parents take their time 
and wait until they feel comfortable resuming penetrative sex.

Lead study author, Associate
Professor Stephanie Brown, said: ‘The most important 
finding from the study is the wide time interval over which couples 
resume sex after childbirth.

‘Most couples do not resume sex until after 6 to 8 weeks postpartum, and many delay much longer than this.

‘This
is useful information for couples to know before their baby is born, 
and may help reduce feelings of anxiety and guilt about not resuming 
sexual activity sooner.’

John Thorp, BJOG Deputy Editor in Chief said: ‘It is very common for women and their partners to want information about when sexual activity may be safely and comfortably resumed, and what to expect in relation to the impact of childbirth on their relationship.

‘Having reliable information to guide clinical practice can dispel common myths about what is normal during the postnatal period as well as enabling clinicians to tailor information to a woman’s individual circumstances.

‘This study provides important new evidence to guide information given to women and their partners about what to expect after childbirth. However, it is important to remember that these decisions are down to the individual couple and when it feels right for them.'

However, the National Childbirth Trust recommends that new mothers do not have sex until their post-birth bleeding stops because they otherwise risk infection.
