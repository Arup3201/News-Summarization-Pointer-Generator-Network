Accused: Ramon Gustavo Castillo Gaete, 36, was found hanged in an abandoned house in Peru

The body of a Chilean man accused in the ritual killing of a three-day-old girl was found hanged in an abandoned house in Peru.

Ramon Castillo, 36, was found hanging from a beam on the second floor of the house in the highlands city of Cuzco early yesterday.

He was wearing jeans, a gray jacket, a cap, shoes and a backpack, General Javier Avalos, the regional police chief, said.

He said the body was identified through fingerprints that Chile sent via Interpol. He said it was too early to say whether Castillo's death was suicide.

Police in neighbouring Chile had been seeking Castillo and two other members of the sect that he led for their alleged participation in the baby's killing.

It happened on a hill in the town of Colliguay near the Chilean port of Valparaiso on November 23.

The child's mother was arrested last week along with three other members of the sect. She allegedly approved the sacrifice.

Natalie Guerra, 25, hid her face in a 
coat as she attended a hearing into the killing of her daughter who was 
burned alive on a bonfire.

She put a hand over her mouth as she sat
alongside sect members Carla Franchy, Maria del Pilar Alvarez and David
Pastene during the tribunal in Quilpe, 70 miles west of Santiago.

Chilean police have said the baby was thrown onto a bonfire because Castillo and his followers believed the child was the antichrist.

Authorities said the 12-member sect was formed in 2005 and counted among its members professionals with university degrees.

Police said the group's rituals included using ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic plant that grows in Amazon forests.

Guerra is said to have told police: 'I was devastated but (sect members) told me that it had to be -- that it was my karma.'

Cult chief Ramon Gustavo Castillo Gaete, 36, who sacrificed the baby because he believed she was was the antichrist and the end of the world was near, has been on the run for weeks.

Police said he was last seen travelling to Peru to buy ayahuasca, a 
hallucinogenic brew plant that he used to control his 12-member sect.

Authorities revealed the baby was burned alive on November 23 at a farm outside the town of Quilpe.

'We found bones that correspond' to those of an infant, said Miguel Ampuero,  of the Police investigative Unit, Chile's equivalent of the FBI.

'The baby was naked.They strapped tape around her mouth to keep her from screaming. Then they placed her on a board.

'After calling on the spirits they threw her on the bonfire alive.'

In
an interview with  24 Horas, the 
officer said that none of the suspects - including the mother - had 
shown any remorse for what happened, believing the sacrifice 
'saved the world.'

The sect was formed in 2005 and is made up of professional workers.

Ampuero added: ' We have someone who was a veterinarian and who 
worked as a flight attendant, we have a filmmaker, a draftsman. Everyone
has a university degree.'

Investigation: The alleged act was performed at a house in Collguay
