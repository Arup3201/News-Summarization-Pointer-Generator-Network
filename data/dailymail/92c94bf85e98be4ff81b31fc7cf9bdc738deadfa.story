IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said the Budget in March would be a good time to slow the pace of austerity

George Osborne should curb Britain’s austerity plan within months, the International Monetary Fund warned today.

The Chancellor was told the economy still ‘looks bad’ and the Budget in March would be a ‘good time’ to reconsider his Plan A programme of cuts.

Growth forecasts for this year have been downgraded from 1.1 per cent to just 1 per cent, amid growing fears of a ‘triple dip’ recession.

IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said the anaemic growth in the UK meant Mr Osborne had to reconsider the decision to impose deep spending cuts across government.

‘We've never been passionate about austerity. From the beginning we have always emphasised that fiscal consolidation should be slow and steady,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘We said that if things look bad at the beginning of 2013 - which they do - then there should be a reassessment of fiscal policy. We still believe that,’ he said.

Mr Osborne has previously relied on the support of the IMF for his plan to deal with the nation’s debts.

But Mr Blanchard said the time had come for the change of tack, and Mr Osborne should use the Budget on March 20 to put the brakes on cuts to public spending.

‘You have a budget coming in March and we think that would be a good time to take stock and make some adjustments,’ he said.

‘We think that slower fiscal consolidation in some form may well be appropriate.’

There are concerns that official 
growth figures for the last three months of 2012, due to be published 
tomorrow, will show the economy shrank, adding to pressure on Mr Osborne
to ease his approach.

Mr 
Blanchard said the global economy was ‘not out of the woods yet’ and 
governments had to be prepared to rethink they austerity approach.

Yesterday the IMF trimmed its forecast for UK and global economic growth this year and next year.

Britain will only expand by 1 per cent in 2012-13, according to the respected body, 0.1 per cent less than previously predicted.

The forecast for next year has been downgraded from 2.2 per cent to 1.9 per cent since October.

The IMF's World Economic Outlook update predicted that the global economy would grow 0.1 per cent less than anticipated in each year, by 3.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively.

Much of the reduction stemmed from a weaker outlook for the eurozone.

‘Policy actions have lowered acute crisis risks in the euro area and the United States. But in the euro area, the return to recovery after a protracted contraction is delayed,’ the IMF said.

Labour's Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: 'David Cameron and George Osborne must finally heed the IMF’s advice.

'They have repeatedly warned that a change of course would be needed in Britain if the economy turns out worse than expected. After two and a half years of flatlining and a double-dip recession the IMF is now clearly losing patience.'

A Treasury spokesman said: 'As the Governor of the Bank of England said this week, the UK economy is moving in the right direction.

'Yesterday’s report by the IMF highlights the continuing challenges facing the global economy. It also emphasises that advanced economies “need steady and sustained fiscal consolidation”.

'The UK's deficit is down by a quarter and the Government will continue its action to deal with our debts and re-balance the economy.'
