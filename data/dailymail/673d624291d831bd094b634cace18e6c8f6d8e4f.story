When they opened a tea shop in a wealthy village, the owners expected to play host to nothing more than the well-to-do locals and a few tourists.

So imagine their shock when they arrived at work one morning to find a swarm of cockroaches scuttling round the shop.

Around 50 of the bright red insects had been posted through the letter box overnight.

Shocked: Magda Wencel and Diane Bryant at their tea shop in Cookham, Berkshire, were shocked at the attack

They are believed to have been the Madagascan hissing variety, which can grow to three inches long and move very fast.

The attack happened less than two weeks after business partners Diane Bryant and Magda Wencel opened the Teapot tea shop in Cookham, on the banks of the Thames in Berkshire.

The pair have no idea who is to blame, but one line of inquiry is that it could have been a business rival.

Police have said that because of the close-knit nature of the community, they will gladly receive anonymous information about the crime, which led to the immediate temporary closure of the cafe for hygiene reasons.

A pest controller was called and police have collected samples of the cockroaches in the hope that they can be traced to the perpetrator following scientific testing.

In Britain they can be bought only from pet shops specialising in rare creatures because they have to be bred and kept in precise conditions.

Shocked: The attack happened less than two weeks after the business partners opened the tea shop

Mrs Bryant, 43, said of the attack: ‘It’s a disgusting thing to do, it’s vicious. We are a brand new tea shop. For someone to do this is just vile.’

But she added that they have been ‘overwhelmed’ by support from the residents in Cookham.

Locals include World Cup-winning rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward, singer Chris Rea and TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson.

Mrs Bryant said: ‘Everybody has been knocking on the door and they are absolutely shocked by what has happened.’

Madagascan hissing cockroaches come from the south-east African island and are sold by specialist breeders for around £20 for a batch of 50.

If one is disturbed or alarmed it makes an unpleasant hissing sound by breathing through an airhole.

The cockroaches can climb surfaces including glass, making them extremely hard for exterminators to kill once there has been an infestation.

Although the tea shop had to close, it was open for business again the next day after receiving a clean bill of health.

The Teapot has opened next door to a delicatessen that serves coffees, and there is another tea and cake shop further down the high street. Several pubs on the same road also serve cream teas, as do a few other cafes in the village.

Cookham is a popular base for picturesque walks by the Thames. Author Kenneth  Grahame lived in the parish as a child and is said to have been inspired by the river to write The Wind In The Willows.

The artist Sir Stanley Spencer, who described Cookham as a ‘village in heaven’, lived and worked there, and several of his works hang in a gallery close to the Teapot.
