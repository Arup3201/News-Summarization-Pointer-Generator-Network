Fearing a slew of Republican victories on Election Day, Democrats are relying on racially-charged campaign advertisements to turn blacks out to vote next Tuesday.

With the U.S. Senate and more than a dozen governors' mansions up for grabs, Democrats are hoping to relight a fire in the bellies of the president's most loyal supporters.

Republicans say the ads go too far, though, and have slammed the ads over the top race-bating. 

One mailer in Georgia features two black children on the cover and tells the recipient to vote 'if you want to prevent another Ferguson in their future.

This flyer is being circulated by the Georgia Democratic Party ahead of Tuesday's election. Republicans have slammed it as race-baiting

Another flier created by the Georgia Democratic Party says, 'It’s up to us to vote to protect the legacy of the first African-American president,'

And the New York Times reports that progressive group Color of Changer has littered Arkansas mailboxes with mailers that say, 'Enough! Republicans are targeting our kids, silencing our voices and even trying to impeach our president.'

In North Carolina, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's Senate Majority PAC is running radio ads that ding Republican Senate nominee Thom Tillis for his support for the type of gun laws that 'caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.'

'It’s not race-baiting; it’s actually happening,' Jaymes Powell Jr., a leader of the North Carolina Democratic Party’s African-American Caucus told the New York Times, referring to a plethora of laws black feel unfairly target them, such as voter identification laws.

'I can’t catch a fish unless there’s a worm on the hook,' he said. 

While the race-based ads have predominately appeared in southern states, the Democratic Party of Maryland is also circulating a pamphlet invoking segregation and 'birtherism,' according to the Washington Times.

Those flyers were paid for by the Maryland Democratic Party, the Washington times said, and are meant to drum up votes for Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who is locked in a tight race for Republican Larry Hogan.

'Vote for Anthony Brown as Maryland’s first African-American Governor,' of the ads reportedly says. 'History is watching to see if we vote.'

Ads like the one above are running in southern states as part of the Democratic Party's attempt to get African-American voters to the polls

It also includes images of sign for a 'colored waiting room,' a 'Must Show ID to Vote' sign and a photo of a white protester holding a sign that says, 'Go Back to Africa Negroes,' according to the Washington Times, which did not publish photos of the mailers along with its story.

On another page of the flyer real estate mogul Donald Trump is pictured in front of a billboard that says, 'Where’s the birth certificate.'

Trump has long been a skeptic of the origin of Obama's birth and even made a wager with the president to release the long form version. 

Asked about the pamphlet by the Washington Times, the head of the Prince George's Country, Maryland, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People chapter, Bob Ross told the Washington Times: 'I can’t control the Democratic Party. They shouldn’t do that.

Ross said he had not seen the alleged ads, but said if the Democratic Party 'should just let it go on the issues.'

That said, Ross argued that 'it’s a free democracy, if that’s what they choose to do.'

'I guess everybody tries to exploit voters in one fashion or another,' he added. 

Former Lt. Gov. of Maryland and the former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said it's clear what Democrats are trying to accomplish with racially-tinged ads. 

'They have been playing on this nerve in the black community that if you even so much as look at a Republican, churches will start to burn, your civil rights will be taken away and young black men like Trayvon Martin will die,' Steele told the New York Times.

'The reality of it is, the Democrats realize that their most loyal constituency is not as loyal as they once were.'

Likewise, a current RNC spokesman, Raffi Williams, told MailOnline that 'he RNC’s relationship and community based approach to black voter engagement is now focused on activating and mobilizing supporters that we’ve reclaimed and recruited to the Republican Party. 

'Meanwhile, Democrats are relying on racially divisive rhetoric to gin up unenthusiastic voters and distract from talking about their policies that have failed black communities,' Williams said.

Democratic National Committee Communications Director Mo Elleithee refused to condemn or officially condone the ads in Georgia when confronted about them by MSNBC host Craig Melvin yesterday afternoon.

'Look do, I think it's appropriate to constantly remind people how important it is to vote, how important it is to make your voice heard, how important it is to remain engaged, and how if you don't, you lose your voice?' he said. 'Absolutely I think that's important to keep doing.'

'But can you not do that without trotting out the images of dead black teenagers?' Melvin, who is black, asked him. 

Elleithee responded with more talking points until the clock ran out on the segment a few moments later.

With the U.S. Senate and more than a dozen governors' mansions up for grabs, Democrats are hoping that this ad, running in Georgia, will relight a fire in the bellies of the president's most loyal supporters

African-Americans, who make up a significant part of the Democratic Party's voting bloc, do not traditionally turn out to vote in midterm elections as frequently as they do when the presidency is on the line. 

An analysis of African Americans' voting habits conducted by the Associated Press shows that roughly four of 10 African Americans adults voted in recent congressional elections in non-presidential years. That number jumped to six in 10 both years Obama was on the ballot.  

Recognizing the peril his party faces if blacks don't come to his rescue once again, President Barack Obama has taken to the airwaves in areas heavily populated by African Americans to stump for Democratic candidates.

'I’ll bet there are whole bunch of folks listening to your show who may not even know that there’s an election going on. I need everybody to go vote,' Obama said recently on the Atlanta, Georgia, based Rickey Smiley Morning Show.

Obama has also appeared on civil rights leader Al Sharpton's radio show to make his case, as well as a handful of other shows that are popular with black audiences. 

While the president clearly believes that a personal plea from him to voters will help boost Democratic candidates' numbers in the south, embattled southern senators aren't so sure.

Obama is not particularly popular there, or anywhere, for that matter.

Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, who is neck and neck with challenger Republican opponent, Tom Cotton, told Fox News today that Obama 'has been a drag' on his reelection chances. 'I’m just going to be honest about that.'

'People here know that I have had my fair share of disagreements with him and you can look at, you know, gun control issues. You can look at Keystone pipeline. You know, I never supported one of his budgets,' Pryor said, making a last-ditch effort to retain his seat in the federal legislature.

'The reality of it is, the Democrats realize that their most loyal constituency is not as loyal as they once were,' Republican National Committee spokesman Raffi Williams said of the mailers

Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu said yesterday in an interview that while she thinks Obama has likability problems in her state because of his energy policies, the anti-Obama sentiment there cuts deeper than his policies.

'To be very, very honest with you, the South has not always been the friendliest place to African-Americans,' she told MSNBC's Chuck Todd on Thursday. 'It’s been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a positive light as a leader.

She went on to say, 'It’s not always been a good place for women to be able to present ourselves, it’s more of a conservative place.'

Landrieu's opponent in the race, Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, fired back at her on Fox News later that evening.

'I wish she would focus more on policies instead of insulting,' Cassidy told Fox's Megyn Kelly. 'We’re going through the political process to have a change – how our Constitution prescribes how you do it – and we’re called racist. 

'We’re not racist, we just have common sense,' he added.
