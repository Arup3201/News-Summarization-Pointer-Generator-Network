Annie Ramsay, 8, was walking to the park with friends when she was attacked by a dog last week

An eight-year-old girl has been left eating through a syringe after she was attacked by a springer spaniel that tore a centimetre off her lip and bit through her cheek.

Annie Ramsay was walking with her friends  near her home in Whittle-le-Woods, Lancashire, on Thursday when she bent down to stroke the dog as it made its way out of a park with its owner.

Her friend stroked the animal first before Annie did the same but the spaniel, which was known to her, licked her face then sank its teeth into her cheek - puncturing her.

She ran back home with blood pouring down her face screaming 'I'm going to die' as her horrified father, John, 47, called for an ambulance.

Annie was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery, where doctors used the inside or her lip to rebuild the part that had been torn off.

She spent three days being treated before she was allowed back home on Sunday, where she is still recovering.

The attack has left her unable to eat and her mother Rebecca Ramsay, 34, has to blend her food and feed it to her through a straw or with a syringe.

Mrs Ramsay, who has two older sons, Steven, 14, and Josh, 12, said: 'I was heartbroken when I saw her. It's just awful.

'She was petrified but she's been so brave and we're really proud of her. She's a huge dog lover and so sweet with animals so it was a big shock to her.

'The first day after the attack we couldn't even mention the word "dog" around her - she was hysterical.

'But I've been trying to explain to her that you get good dogs and bad dogs because I don't want her to be frightened of them but at the same time part of me never wants her to go near one again.'

The schoolgirl had bent down to stroke the dog when it sunk its teeth into her cheek and tore a centimetre of skin from her lip. SHe was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery to fix the damage

The family was struck by tragedy in 2011 when Annie's older brother, Dylan, drowned while swimming in a quarry near their home.

'Since his death I have been campaigning around schools about safety and that's where I was at when Annie was attacked,' said Mrs Ramsay.

Annie, who has since returned home to recover, is likely to have a hairline scar as a result of the attack

'She had been out playing with friends and the owner, who she knows and lives on our road, was coming out of the park and she stroked it like she has done several times before.

'It liked her face and that's when it bit into her cheek and took about a centimetre off her lip. She ran home screaming and my husband shouted for a neighbour to call the ambulance. 

'Her brothers were terrified, especially after losing Dylan so recently, about what would happen to their sister. 

'I rushed to the hospital as soon as I heard and I couldn't believe it when I saw her. But the doctors are hopeful and we have to share their enthusiasm that she will be okay.'

Annie is recovering at home and was even strong enough to make it to a party on Sunday where she met 'Olaf' from Frozen.

'She's in a lot of pain and on lots of antibiotics but she's in really good spirits,' she added.

It's likely she will be left with a hairline scar on her face, but her eye is expected to return fully to normal.

Lancashire Constabulary confirmed that a warrant under the dangerous dogs act was executed and the dog seized.

It remains in kennels and an investigation is under way, which will involve speaking to the victim any witnesses and the dog's owner.

Mrs Ramsay, whose own dog - a Staffie cross - died recently, said: 'The police are carrying out interviews and will need to speak to Annie in-depth before anything is done.

'There were lots of witnesses too so I think they need to speak to them as well. We're not sure what is going to happen to the dog but it should be put down after what it's done to my daughter.'
