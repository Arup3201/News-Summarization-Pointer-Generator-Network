It’s Not About The Shark

by David Niven

(Icon Books £12.99)

I have always felt there is a time and a place for self-help books. That time is Not Now and the place is Somewhere Else, A Long Way Away.

But, just occasionally, a book comes along that is not only interesting, but might — just might — be of some conceivable help to someone.

This, I believe, is one such. Niven, an American psychologist and social scientist, and by no means the long-deceased star of The Guns Of Navarone, sets out to help us ‘solve unsolvable problems’. While he doesn’t, because they’re unsolvable, he does help us solve problems that look unsolvable but aren’t — which, I suppose, is the next best thing.

Steven Spielberg had spent the Jaws' entire original budget on one prop, a mechanical shark (stock picture)

The shark in question was the one in Jaws. Steven Spielberg had spent the film’s entire original budget on one prop, a mechanical shark which, on film, looked exactly like a mechanical shark. Not only was it not scary, but in saltwater ‘even its synthetic skin failed, as it became waterlogged and bloated, transforming the terrifying shark into a giant sea marshmallow’.

What to do? Niven says that, when we have a problem, many of us are overwhelmed by it. ‘Like staring at the sun and not being able to see the sky all around it, we stare at our problems and cannot see anything else, much less a solution.’

Spielberg didn’t stare at his problem. He just asked himself, ‘What would Alfred Hitchcock do?’ And he realised that the answer was not to show the shark at all, if possible. As his star Richard Dreyfuss said, with admiration: ‘He had to invent, on the spot, another way of shooting, which was to imply the shark, which made an ordinary film into a great film.’

Problems, of course, are everywhere. People can’t make decisions, so hamstrung are they by the fear of making the wrong decision.

Niven tells the story of the sitcom Seinfeld, one of two pilots made by NBC one summer. The studio audience detested it.

NBC executives could see the show’s potential, but no one had the courage to go out on a creative limb, so they instead ordered something called Sister Kate, which was bland, familiar and utterly unexceptional.

It barely lasted a year. In the meantime, Seinfeld squeaked in through the back door. Eventually, it would be making NBC $300 million a year. Jerry Seinfeld now keeps a framed copy of that original audience report on his desk, as does the executive who originally said no.

A lot of what Niven says is pretty obvious, but worth saying anyway. People in groups tend to make worse decisions than individuals: indeed, they will sometimes make decisions that none of them individually agrees with (this would explain a few Booker Prize winners).

Sometimes, we think the way to solve a problem is to try harder, work longer hours, put in more effort. Niven comes up with examples to show that this can make the problem worse. As he puts it: ‘There is a giant hole in the equation Incentive + Harder Work = Better Outcome.’

Ask yourself what Hitchcock would do. Go for a walk. Let the solution come to you when you’re least expecting it. Niven can be very American in his assumptions and his tone of voice. But there’s very little of the forced cheerfulness that can bring up your breakfast with a single heave.

His arguments are sound, his stories intriguing — and your muesli safe. If there’s any higher praise for a self-help book, I can’t imagine it.
