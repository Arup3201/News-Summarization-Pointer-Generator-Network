An Oregon man who claims he was seduced by an IRS agent and just as quickly abandoned during an audit that left him owning $69,000 wants to sue the U.S. government.

Vincent Burroughs has already had one case against agent Dora Abrahamson and the federal government dropped.

Now he's appealing and says the IRS must be held accountable for his feeling 'like a cheap wh***.'

Racy: Vincent Burroughs (right) claims IRS agent Dora Abrahamson seduced him after contacting him about an audit and realizing she knew him from his amateur motorcycle races

Burroughs alleges Abrahamson contacted him about an audit in August 2011.

The amateur motorcycle racer and professional contractor says he'd fallen about $20,000 behind on taxes after his once steady work dried up during the recession.

Abrahamson allegedly told Burroughs she was a fan of his racing and 'knew who he was, and that it was lucky for him that this was the case, and that they should meet.'

A series of text messages were exchanged. Some on Abrahamson's end were allegedly lurid and Burroughs claims she sent him a racy photo.

Burroughs initially ignored the woman's advances, according to the lawsuit, but he surrendered after a 'provocatively attired' Abrahamson arrived at his home in September 2011, the lawsuit states.

'She told (Burroughs) that she could 
be a bitch, or that she could be nice,' states the suit, which Burroughs
 and his attorney David Moule recently revealed was dismissed.

'She
 said that she could impose no penalty, or a 40 percent penalty, and 
that if he would give her what she wanted, she would give him what he 
needed,' it alleged.

'I feel like a cheap wh***': Burroughs said the two had sex and that days later Abrahamson dropped his case because of a conflict of interest. He says the agent who took his case then said he owed far more than he believes he owes and wants the government to pay for Abrahamson's 'sexual coercion' and for ruining his relationship with this longtime girlfriend

'She just pushed me back, and I kind of went back, and I landed...and she immediately came over, got on top of me, started kissing on me,' he told 20/20 last year.

The two of them had sex. Days later, Abrahamson contacted him to say she would no longer be handling the case due to the conflict of interest.

After another agent did the audit, Burroughs was told he owed $69,000.

The lawsuit claims that Abrahamson's conduct caused the plaintiff distress and a rift in his relationship with a 'significant other' and Burroughs reiterated as much in a tearful 2013 interview with 20/20.

The suit alleged that the government was liable for damages because IRS officials provided inadequate supervision.

However, the case--which was asking the government pay out $100,000, has since been dismissed.

'The government (said) that it was immune from lawsuit because it had never waived its immunity for intentional acts of its employees that were committed outside the scope of their employment,' said the attorney Moule.

The plaintiff had already removed Abrahamson's name from the suit by the time it was dismissed because she lacked assets for them to go after.

Abrahamson has never publicly commented on her role in the case but denied Burroughs' allegations in court papers.
