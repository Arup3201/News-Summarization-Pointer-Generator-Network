Victim: Lee Catton was allegedly driving at 42mph in a 30mph zone when he hit Hichame Bouadimi dragging the boy under the wheels of his truck

A skip lorry driver ran over and killed a five-year-old boy after the boy slipped from his mother’s hand, a court heard.

Lee Catton, 48, was allegedly driving at 42mph along a 30mph stretch of road when he hit Hichame Bouadimi, dragging the boy under the wheels of his truck.

Hichame, who had been walking with his mother and older sister, had run into St Georges Road near the Elephant and Castle roundabout, in south London, after slipping from the clutches of his mother's hand.

Jacob Hallam, prosecuting, told jurors: ‘This is a tragic case; it involves the sudden death of a little boy, Hichame Bouadimi. 

‘He was only five-years-old when he was killed on the afternoon of October 3, 2012.

‘He [Hichame] somehow slipped from his mum’s hand and ran on to the road. Why he did that we will never know but he did.’

Mr Hallam added: ‘Hichame’s death must have been virtually instantaneous, his injuries were terrible.

'His body lay in the road after Mr Catton’s lorry had driven over it, people who were there went towards him, one of them covered him with their coat.’ 

Woolwich Crown Court heard how a speed recording device in Catton’s lorry had later showed that he had been driving above the speed limit at the time of the impact.

Mr Hallam said: ‘He was driving too fast on a school day when uniformed school children were around on both sides [of the road]’

Catton told police afterwards that he had suddenly become aware of a figure running into the path of his lorry from the left adding: ‘By the time I saw him it was too late’.

Scene of the death: Hichame was walking with his mother and older sister before he apparently ran into St George's Road in the Elephant and Castle area of south London

Mr Hallam told the court that the consequences of the crash had had a deep impact on Catton.

‘There is absolutely no doubt that he was profoundly affected by what happened to him. He made the position clear later that same day when he was interviewed by police.’

Catton, from Southwark, south London, denies causing death by dangerous driving and an alternative count of causing death through careless driving.

The trial continues.
