The terrifying moment a family car crashes into a lorry at 50mph - and is shunted along the carriageway for 100 yards has been caught on a dashboard camera.

The Honda Civic was filmed as it attempted to pull onto the M25 between two lorries.

But the footage shows the driver badly miscalculate the gap between the two vehicles and it is soon careering dangerously across the lane.

The rear of car is clipped by the front wing of the lorry - causing it to flip sideways and parallel to the front.

The terrifying moment a family car crashes into a lorry at 50mph - and is shunted along the carriageway for 100 yards has been caught on a dashboard camera

But thanks to the quick-thinking actions of the lorry driver, the Honda is safely brought to a standstill on the hard shoulder.

No one was seriously injured in the collision, with news of the crash only emerging after the driver of the Civic filed a whiplash claim.

He was blaming the lorry driver for the incident- but the trucker had a SmartWitness camera fitted to his dashboard which filmed the whole incident.

The video proved the Honda driver was responsible and his claim against the HGV driver's insurance was thrown out.

It was one of 550,000 whiplash claims filed last year, with insurance experts estimating around 60 per cent are bogus.

The £1 billion-a-year fraud has led to the UK becoming the whiplash capital of the world.

There has been a 60 per cent rise in the number of personal injury claims since 2006, according to the AA.

This is despite reported accidents on UK roads falling by 20 per cent during the same period.

SmartWitness systems, which makes on-board cameras, says it has saved insurance companies £20 million by providing evidence against whiplash and personal injury claims.

Sales of the firm's cameras have soared by 40 per cent in two years as motorists protect themselves against the dangers of fraudsters.

Simon Marsh, managing director of SmartWitness, said: 'The camera never lies. Increasing numbers of motorists are using CCTV cameras to protect themselves against fraudulent injury claims.'
