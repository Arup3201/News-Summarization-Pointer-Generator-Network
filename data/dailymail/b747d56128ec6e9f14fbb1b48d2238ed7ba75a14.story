A British Army-run academy to train Afghan military officers dubbed 'Sandhurst in the sand' could be axed if the US pulls all its troops from the warzone.

Some 170 UK troops are set to teach cadets skills and discipline at a replica of the Royal Military Academy being built in the desert at Qargha, west of the Afghan capital Kabul.

The Afghan National Army Officer Academy, expected to open early next year, will focus on military tactics and leadership to defeat the Taliban.

Withdrawal: David Cameron, pictured visiting troops in Afghanistan last month, has committed to pulling all combat personnel out of the country by the end of 2014

Tactics: Sources in Washington say President Obama is considering speeding up the US withdrawal from Afghanistan

But the centre would be jeopardised if President Barack Obama carries out a threat to withdraw all American forces from the battlefield by the end of next year, experts have warned.

The White House is committed to ending combat operations on December 31, 2014, but planned to keep about 8,000 troops, including engineers, medics and air support, in Afghanistan to back local forces.

But cooling relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai means President Obama is 'seriously considering' speeding up the drawdown.

It could lead to Washington taking the 'zero option' of bringing every US serviceman and woman home and leaving Karzai's forces to fend for themselves.

'There's always been a zero option, 
but it was not seen as the main option,' a senior Western official in 
Kabul told the New York Times.

'It is now becoming one of them, and if you listen to some people in Washington, it is maybe now being seen as a realistic path.'

A full-scale pullout would have serious implications for Prime Minister David Cameron over his plan to open the 'Sandhurst in the sand'.

Senior sources in Whitehall insisted the UK remained 'committed' to opening the academy but military commanders will urge politicians to reconsider the plan if the US withdraws all troops.

Top brass would question whether the safety of 170 British service personnel could be compromised if only a small number of Nato troops remain in the warzone.

Major Charles Heyman, who edits the British Army handbook, said: 'If the US pulled everything out we would have to pull out in parallel, and so would the Germans, French, Italians and other Nato forces. It would be too dangerous to stay.'

But he said the prospect was 'highly unlikely'. 'This seems to be a bit of a kite-flying exercise by the US to concentrate Karzai's mind on negotiations over security,' said Maj Heyman.

The US and Afghanistan have been in talks for months over a long-term security deal involving how many troops and bases the Nato-led coalition should leave in the war-torn country and the speed of the withdrawal.

But the relationship between President Obama and President Karzai reached a new low last month after the US attempted to begin peace talks with the Taliban.

This led to President Karzai suspending negotiations on the security pact, which could be worth as much as Â£5.3billion a year to Kabul.

Reassurance needed: Whitehall sources have said if all US troops were to withdraw, British and other NATO forces would have to follow suit

A June 27 video conference between the pair aimed at defusing tensions ended badly, according to US officials.

They raised the prospect that the US could accelerate the drawdown to bring the bulk of the troops home next summer.

The number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan - now around 63,000 - already is set to decline to 34,000 by February.

But Afghanistan played down the possibility of President Obama ordering a complete withdrawal.

One senior official in Kabul said: 'Both sides understand how to pressure each other. But both the U.S. and Afghanistan fully understand the need for foreign troops, especially U.S. ones, to stay beyond 2014.

'That it is vital for security here and in the wider region. We don't think the U.S. will compromise on that, because past experience of abandoning Afghanistan was that the country descended into chaos.'

Last month it was revealed that Britain was coming under pressure to keep additional troops in Afghanistan for up to five years after the end of combat operations in 2014.

A senior military commander said Nato personnel would be needed to provide medical evacuation and logistics, plan helicopter operations and integrate ground combat with air support.
