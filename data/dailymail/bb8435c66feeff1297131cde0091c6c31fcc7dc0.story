Police are making fresh investigations into whether dead paedophile Raymond Hewlett had anything to with the disappearance of missing Madeleine McCann.

The 64-year-old pervert was living just an hour's drive from where the youngster disappeared in the Algarve in May 2007 while she was on holiday with her parents.

Scotland Yard detectives now allegedly want to speak to a couple who the child molester befriended while they were on holiday and who allegedly told them gypsies had approached him asking to buy his children.

Raymond Hewlett says he spoke to gypsies who were interested in buying children

Alan and Cindy Thompson, from Nottingham, only discovered after their Portugal holiday the history of the former soldier when they returned home, and raised the alarm when they realised he had been living in a caravan close to where the three-year-old vanished, the Daily Mirror reported.

The pervert, who died of throat cancer in 2010, told the couple that he refused to sell one of his six children to 'gypsy tourists'.

He also boasted to them of making a 'good business trip' with his family to Morocco to make a sale, but would not elaborate on the nature of his trip.

Numerous people contacted authorities to say they had spotted a girl matching Maddie's description in North Africa after she disappeared.

But Hewlett, who was living with his wife and six children on a campsite when Madeleine disappeared, refused to answer the Thompson's questions when they contacted him in 2009.

When he was confronted by private detectives Dave Edgar and Arthur Cowley, working on behalf of Maddie's devastated parents Kate and Gerry McCann, he refused to answer their questions on provide an alibi, it was reported.

Madeleine vanished days before her fourth birthday from an apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz while her parents, Kate and Gerry, had dinner with friends in a nearby tapas restaurant.

Raymond Hewlett denied knowing about the youngster's disappearance

Hewlett's worrying revelation came after another person said that he had spoken to them about the pervert's claims that gypsies had approached him about buying children.

Former Scots Guard Peter Verran, 46, who met Hewlett on a Morrocan campsite between June and November 2007, said the criminal had told him that gypsies had paid for children and sold them on to paedophiles.

In 2012 Hewlett 'confessed' to knowing what happened to the little girl on his deathbed, it was claimed.

Raymond Hewlett  wrote to his estranged son denying he played a part in the three-year-old’s abduction, but claimed he knew she had been ‘stolen to order’ by a gypsy gang.

Hewlett had previously claimed to have seen the missing toddler twice before she vanished in 2007.

But he vowed only to reveal where he was the night she went missing if he was paid thousands of pounds.

Kate and Gerry McCann’s private detectives refused the request.

In May the £2million police review of the Madeleine McCann case said it would examine calls from psychics which were previously ignored.

Detectives said they would study around 100 logs of calls that were discounted because the callers said they were psychics or had dreamt about the high-profile investigation.

Policia Judiciaria refused to confirm whether they had ever questioned the paedophile, the newspaper reported.

A spokesman for Scotland Yard told the Daily Mirror: 'We are not prepared to discuss any particular lines of enquiry.'.

Hewlett was jailed several times in the UK for sexually assaulting young girls, including an attack in 1978 where he put a gun to his victim's back.

In June 2009, before his death, West Yorkshire Police confirmed its officers were investigating Hewlett in connection with an indecent assault in 1975.
