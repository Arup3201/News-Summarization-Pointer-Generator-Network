Business minister Jo Swinson was due today to announce disgruntled consumers will be able to make joint claims to avoid hefty legal fees

Plans to enable large numbers of consumers or small businesses to sue rogue firms together could lead to US-style ‘litigation culture’, the CBI claimed yesterday.

The body representing industry attacked Government measures to be unveiled today allowing claimants to launch lawsuits together and share costs in ‘class actions’.

Business minister Jo Swinson will announce disgruntled consumers will be able to make joint claims to avoid hefty legal fees.

The plan has been welcomed by consumer watchdog Which?. Executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘This will give consumers more power against unscrupulous businesses.

‘The proposals will help to put consumers in the driving seat and act as a meaningful deterrent to dodgy or dishonest firms.’

But Katja Hall of the CBI warned it would open the door to the type of class actions seen in the US, where claimants can demand huge compensation pay-outs and cripple businesses with lawsuits.

Her criticism is that the system proposed is an ‘opt out’ type, in which many people who may in theory be affected can be included in a suit without their knowledge to give a claim more power and a greater payout.

She said: ‘The Government has let the litigation genie out of the bottle by adopting US-style collective actions.’

She said this ‘will fuel a litigation culture in the UK’.’

The Department for Business said similar ‘opt out’ regimes have been introduced in Norway, Canada and Australia and have not led to US-style class actions, and that strict guidelines would ensure only genuine cases go forward.

Under the plans, competition laws would be changed to allow consumers to begin or join collective action.

Groups will begin arbitration with a firm in the hope it will pay out without legal action. If this fails, the Competition Appeal Tribunal will have more powers to take on class actions.
