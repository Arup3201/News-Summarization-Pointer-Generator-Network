Culinary Casanova Paul Hollywood is spicing up The Great British Bake Off once again, with fans pointing to simmering sexual tension between him and contestant Ruby Tandoh.

Hollywood, 47, made headlines in May when he split from his wife after developing a ‘close friendship’ with 35-year-old Marcela Valladolid, his co-star on the American version of the TV baking competition.

And when he named ex-model Miss Tandoh star baker this week, viewers suggested it was not just her brioche he was sweet on.

The 21-year-old won the ‘sweet dough’ challenge on Tuesday night’s show, making a sweet tea loaf, Hollywood’s recipe for apricot couronne and two varieties of European sweet buns.

But on Twitter, many fans of the BBC2 series were more interested in romance than rolling pins.

Katie Roberts said: ‘I’m going  to miss The Great British Bake Off when it’s done.

'I enjoy living vicariously through the sexual tension between Paul and Ruby.’

Mollie Hinks joked: ‘I thoroughly look forward to Tuesday evenings and witnessing Paul Hollywood trying not to flirt with Ruby.’

Fans of the show have taken to Twitter to say they are more interested in any signs of bubbling romance between the pair than any of the baked goods

Filming of the current, fourth series of The Great British Bake Off began a few weeks after news of Hollywood’s split from his wife Alexandra emerged.

Essex-born Miss Tandoh, who was briefly signed to leading agency Models 1, is now studying philosophy and history of art at University College London.

She struggled to impress Hollywood’s fellow judge Mary Berry at first, but since winning her over is tipped to win.

This week Miss Berry called her bake ‘almost perfect’ and her brioche ‘delicious’.

Despite a less than promising start, student Ruby is now tipped to win the competition
