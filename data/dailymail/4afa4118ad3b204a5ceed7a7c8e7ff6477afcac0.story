A mother who was diagnosed with breast cancer during her pregnancy had a mastectomy just 30 minutes after giving birth.

Sarah Williams gave birth to her son Joshua by planned C-section before surgeons removed her breast in the same operating theatre.

The 40-year-old had already endured five rounds of chemotherapy while carrying her second child, at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales.

Mrs Williams, of Connah’s Quay, was diagnosed with breast cancer after becoming pregnant with Joshua, last year.

Today the mother-of-two recalled her terrifying ordeal. She said: ‘When I was told I had cancer it was an utter shock.

'I was 20 weeks pregnant and kept thinking, “what about the baby?” I was terrified this would mean I would lose him or her.

‘Although I felt in safe hands, it was the most terrifying experience of my life having chemotherapy while knowing I had this precious bundle of joy inside me.’

Doctors at the Wrexham Maelor Hospital planned a treatment plan for Mrs Williams, which aimed to protect her unborn child.

In October she was taken into hospital for a C-section to deliver her baby boy.

Half an hour later, in the same operating theatre, she underwent a mastectomy as well as a procedure to remove 29 lymph nodes, 22 of which had live cancer cells in them.

Following Joshua’s birth, she resumed three more cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy treatment.

Mrs
 Williams, who also has a young daughter, Sasha, said: ‘Chemotherapy was
 a nightmare physically and mentally but it did the trick and, 
thankfully, reduced my tumour.

‘The
 thought of losing the baby and not coming through this to see my little
 girl Sasha grow up was sickening.

'But I tried really hard to push those
 thoughts to the back of my mind and focus on the treatment.’

Having
 conceived naturally after undergoing failed IVF treatment, Mrs Williams
 and husband Carl’s delight turned to concern when she noticed a 
change in one of her breasts.

She initially put it down to the IVF, but tests revealed she had cancer.

‘It’s strange because I wasn’t ill before my diagnosis,’ said Mrs Williams.

‘I was hardly ever poorly. I never had any warning signs.’

She is now preparing to run the Chester Race for Life with Team Beck, and has been chosen to start the countdown on Sunday, July 20.

She has already raised more than £2,000 for Cancer Research UK.

‘I feel so blessed now,’ said Mrs Williams. ‘We have our beautiful little girl and precious baby. I can’t believe that just months ago all this was at risk. I have never valued life so much.’
