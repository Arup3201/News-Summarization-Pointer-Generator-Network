Pictures have now emerged of the gunman who was shot by police when he tried to hide in a California movie theater after allegedly threatened his girlfriend with a pistol.

Tom Billodeaux, 20, of Escondido, California, reportedly pulled a handgun on police officers after they discovered him sitting with 15 other people in the dark theater at Reading Cinemas Carmel Mountain.

Though the pictures are several years old, Tom Billodeaux is seen proudly displaying his figure and posing in self-shot pictures.

Proud of his body: Billodeaux posed for several shirtless photos that were then shared by his sister

His sister Jessica Billodeaux posted the photos of her 'lil brother' in 2008, years before he would be shot twice by police officers in a tense movie theater showdown.

Billodeaux, who is of Laotion descent, ran into a showing of Les Miserables at the Reading Cinemas Carmel Mountain after he allegedly got into a fight with his girlfriend in the parking lot.

A bystander saw him threatening his girlfriend with a gun, and when the bystander went to intervene, Billodeaux turned the gun towards him.

San Diego police armed with assault rifles stormed the cinema and went theater-to-theater looking for Billodeaux.

The terrifying incident, which saw screaming movie patrons hiding behind their seats and fleeing in fear after a gunfire erupted in a move theater bore dark echos the massacre of a late-night screening of 'The Dark Night Rises' in July in Aurora, Colorado.

Billodeaux was wounded, but is expected to survive. He will be charged when he is discharged from the hospital

James Holmes allegedly killed 12 people and wounded 58 others after he attacked unsuspecting theatergoers with an AR-15 assault rifle and smoke grenades.

Captain Terry McManus told U-T San Diego that police searched theater by theater and evacuated moviegoers until two officers spotted Billodeaux in a theater with about 15 others.

McManus said the man initially complied with officers' order to put his hands up, but then he put them back in his lap and brandished a handgun. He said one of the officers opened fire.

The officers thought their lives were threatened, he said, 'and more importantly, they thought the lives of others were in jeopardy.'

Billodeaux was shot in the chest and the arm. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition, though he is expected to survive.

No was else was injured. Police say he
was sitting apart from the other patrons in the theater - though it was
not known how close the nearest bystander was.

Later,
investigators said they did not believe Billodeaux intended to shoot 
anyone in the theater and was merely hiding from authorities.

McManus
said the gunman never made any threats to others in the theater. He 
said the man had left a suicide note at his Escondido home before going 
to his girlfriend's workplace to confront her.
