Most couples dream of a traditional romantic white wedding, but one wacky couple literally created their own unique fairytale wedding.

The Jersey couple tied the knot dressed as Shrek and Princess Fiona from the Dreamworks animated film.

Devoted Paul Bellas, 42, painted himself green and wore monster ears and eyebrows for the movie-themed big day.

Paul Bellas, 42 and his wife Heidi Coxshall, 30, made the unusual choice of getting married dressed as Shrek and Princess Fiona

Heidi transformed into ogre Fiona for the reception, in lien with the film in which the beautiful princess is cursed to turn an ogre when the sun sets

The couple literally had a fairytale wedding with the magical theme running throughout the day's celebrations - including a Shrek cake

Bride Heidi Coxshall, 30, dressed as 
Shrek's sweetheart Princess Fiona for the couple's wedding - which 
featured a cast of characters from the animated film.

Their four-year-old son Leo dressed as Donkey, Shrek's best pal, while Heidi's brother John gave her away as Muffin Man from Shrek 2.

Other guests turned up as fairytale characters Snow White, Cinderella and Belle from Beauty and the Beast.

The happy couple tied the knot on Saturday at the Radisson Blu Hotel in St. Helier, Jersey.

Heidi made the couple's costumes herself, says she was determined to give their 60 guests a memorable time

The wedding guests got into the spirit of the day, dressing as various fairytale characters such as Robin Hood, Minnie Mouse, Snow White and Cinderella

Their four-year-old son Leo, who inspired the strange wedding theme, dressed as Donkey on the day

Heidi said she wanted a beach wedding originally but that 'they won't let you have one of those in Jersey' and so chose Shrek as the theme

Paul, a groundworker, said the couple, of Jersey, had been together for five years when Leo's love of Shrek inspired them to finally tie the knot.

Paul said: 'Leo was watching his Shrek DVD, which he absolutely loves, and Heidi said wouldn't it be nice if we had a little Shrek wedding.

'The message behind Shrek is that it doesn't matter what you look like or who you are, it's all about true love - I thought it sounded absolutely perfect.

Paul and Heidi's green make-u took hours to apply, with Paul also sporting eyebrows, ears and even rubber 'Shrek gloves'

Guests young and old dressed up for the event as fairytale characters

Registrar Sue Groves said she had to see the couple before the got their make-up applied as she can't marry people who aren't recognisable

'All the guests embraced the idea and thoroughly enjoyed themselves - there were times when we fell about laughing.'

Heidi, who made the couple's costumes herself, says she was determined to give their 60 guests a memorable time - even if it meant an hour and a half applying green make-up.

The care assistant said: 'I wanted a beach wedding originally but they won't let you have one of those in Jersey.

Heidi Coxshall became emotional during their special day, which was inspired by their son Leo

Paul was forced to wait around after the ceremony as Heidi was transformed into Ogress Fiona for the reception

Guests really got into the spirit of the day and went all out with elaborate costumes and make-up

The wedding party must have looked a little odd to outsiders

'The Shrek idea basically came about through Leo and it made sense. I'm not the skinniest lady in the world so I thought I would make a pretty decent Fiona.

'Paul's hasn't quite got Shrek's podgy face - but I thought he made a really handsome ogre on the day.'

Heidi Coxshal, seen before and after her ogre transformation, said 'I'm not the skinniest lady in the world so I thought I would make a pretty decent Fiona'

Paul's incredible transformation in Shrek led Heidi to describe his as a 'very handsome ogre'

Registrar Sue Groves said she had carried out many novelty weddings in her time - but never married two ogres.

She said: 'I had to see them before the got their make-up applied as I can't marry people who aren't recognisable.'

Heidi actually tied the knot in human form then returned in green to the reception - mimicking the way Princess Fiona transforms into an ogress at night.
