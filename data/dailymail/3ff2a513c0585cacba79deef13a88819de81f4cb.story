Looking at these stunning pictures, it's difficult to imagine glacial blonde Laura Whitmore ever losing her cool.

But the host of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here Now - the popular spin-off of the main ITV show - has revealed she gets so hot and bothered while on jungle duty she is sometimes forced to go to bizarre lengths to combat the steamy Queensland temperatures.

'We use fans, so when we cut for the ad break I run over to them and stick them up my skirt,' announced the TV presenter, who added that she sweats so much on set she has to stick to a wardrobe of sleeveless tops.

When asked to share her secrets to looking good while filming in the jungle, Laura said: 'Ren do a great tonic mist and the make-up artists use light airbrushing to keep my make-up on.

'But the main thing is I sweat so much,' she told Look magazine, as she posed for a glamorous photo shoot for a party season beauty special.

Despite her sultry appearance in the 
photographs, the down-to-earth presenter had no qualms about revealing 
her daily battle to avoid unsightly sweat patches while working in the 
jungle.

'I can't wear anything with sleeves,' she declared.

With typical candour, the 27-year-old presenter also revealed how she spent her younger years dressing to enhance her cleavage.

'Normally I show off either my legs or cleavage,' she said. 'Recently I've been more of a leg girl - when I was younger it was all about my boobs because I thought they were my best quality.

'But I get more favourable attention with my legs out, and from a better standard of men!'

To that end, the blonde star accentuates her assets with stilettos - the wardrobe item she said instantly gets her in the mood to party.

'I think high heels are sexy,' she added.

Now that her jungle duties are over 
for another year, Laura is looking forward to upping the glam stakes 
over the Christmas period.

When
asked to name the time she felt most glamorous, the presenter cited the
thigh-skimming Stella McCartney number she chose for the 2012 National 
Television Awards in January.

'I loved it because it was quirky and felt very me, but I was comfortable too,' she said.

'I don't want to have to breathe in all night - I want to eat a meal and dance.'
