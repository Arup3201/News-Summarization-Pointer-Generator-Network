Being accused of brutally murdering her college roommate apparently hasn't impacted Amanda Knox's love life, as the 27-year-old was spotted out this weekend with a new boyfriend in New York. 

Knox was last known living in Seattle with her classical guitarist boyfriend James Terrano, but it appears she has moved on to another musician - an aspiring rocker named Colin Sutherland, 27.

The new couple were pictured passionately kissing on the beach and on the boardwalk during a day-trip to Coney Island, and holding hands while shopping vintage stores with a female friend in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick.

Knox and Terrano were last pictured together in July, when she was seen handing over $100 in cash to her boyfriend, in an emotional meeting in which she both sobbed and laughed. It's unclear when the two broke up, or for what reason.

'They were both oblivious to everything around them and only seemed bothered about each other, like a pair of teenagers,' a bystander told The Sun.

According to a website advertising one of Sutherland's creative projects, the 27-year-old describes himself as a 'nomad by nature'. 

A LinkedIn profile for Sutherland - who goes by the name 'Thunderstrike after the Marvel comic-book character - says he studied French at Sarah Lawrence and lives in Brooklyn. It's unclear if Knox has moved to New York to be with her new man, or if she was just visiting. She was set to graduate from the University of Washington this past June with a degree in creative writing.

These new pictures are surfacing just one year after Knox was pictured hugging  her 30-year-old ex-boyfriend, Italian Raffaelle Sollecito, on another trip to the Big Apple. 

The two have since been re-convicted in the murder case of British student Meredith Kercher, who was found dead in 2007 at the age of 21 in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. 

Sollecito and Knox were initially found guilty in Kercher's death but cleared on appeal in 2011, when Knox returned to her Washington state hometown. 

However, the case was brought up again last year and the two found guilty once more. 

The former couple are currently awaiting an Italian appeal court's decision whether to stand by the decision or overturn it. 

If the appeal court confirms the conviction, she may be called back to Italy to face prison time but that's only if the U.S. agrees to extradite her.  

Was it a break up? Knox was last known to be dating classical guitarist James Terrano, who she reportedly lived with in Seattle, Washington. They were last pictured together in July (above), when Knox was seen handing over $100 in cash to Terrano, before sobbing and then laughing in a clearly emotional meeting
