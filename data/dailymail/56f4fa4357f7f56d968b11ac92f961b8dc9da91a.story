A chemistry teacher in Egypt has become a laughing stock after an explosive video of him bungling an experiment became a worldwide internet hit.

The teacher - named locally in the Egyptian capital Cairo as Ahmed Gabr, 38, - was supposed to be showing the class how to produce a mild reaction by producing oxyhydrogen, or bang gas as it is also known.

But he apparently bungled the quantities and sent children screaming from the classroom when the tumbler he was using exploded, showering the room with sparks, flying glass and boiling chemicals.

Before and after: The teacher was supposed to be showing the class how to produce a mild reaction by producing oxyhydrogen

Some of the terrified youngsters can be heard praying as they fight to get out of the classroom while others shout out in distress.

Angry parents flooded the school with complaints as their children came home with chemical splattered clothing.

One - mother Asim Kanika, 36, - said: 'That man is a fool. Its amazing nobody lost an eye with all that flying glass.'

The pupils were showered with the chemical and shards of glass. Their parents were reportedly furious

She added: 'He's very lucky that none of the children were really hurt, just very scared and shaken up.'

Footage of the bungled experiment has made Gabr a reluctant star on YouTube and social media.

One watcher, Hazel222, joked: 'A lesson the kids won't forget in a hurry.'
