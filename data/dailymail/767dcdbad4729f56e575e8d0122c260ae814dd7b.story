Voters support plans for gay  marriage and believe it is wrong  for the Government to ban the Church of England from conducting the ceremonies.

And public opinion is evenly divided over whether marriage is a ‘sacred act between a man and a woman’ and cannot be regarded as the same between same-sex couples.

But they are sceptical about David Cameron’s motives for backing the new laws – only one in seven says he is doing it because he thinks it is right in principle.

Poll: Voters support plans for gay  marriage and believe it is wrong  for the Government to ban the Church of England from conducting the ceremonies

An overwhelming two out of three say he is trying to curry favour with those with trendy views.

The results of a Mail on Sunday poll, conducted by Survation, suggest strong support for gay rights across a wide range of issues among most voters, but with sharp differences between the young and old.

Overall, six out of ten support  the gay marriage plan. Among the under-35s, it soars to 73 per cent;  by contrast, 56 per cent of over-55s are against.

The poll will intensify the debate over claims by Right-wing Tory MPs that the party’s stance on same-sex marriages is resulting in its traditional supporters switching to the anti-EU UKIP party, which opposes gay marriage.

UKIP, led by Nigel Farage, now has nearly half as much support among the public as the Tories,  and over 50 per cent more than the Lib Dems.

Labour is ahead on 38 per cent, with the Conservatives on 30, UKIP 14 and Lib Dems nine.However, the poll offers conflicting evidence over whether Mr  Cameron would have anything to gain by dropping his support for gay marriage.

A total of 23 per cent said they would be more likely to vote Tory if the Prime Minister did a U-turn, against 14 per cent who would be less likely to vote Tory.

However, among those who voted Tory at the 2010 election, 50 per cent back gay marriage, with 50 per  cent against.

And when the sample is whittled down to those who back the  Conservatives now, a total of 56 per cent support it, with 44 per cent against.

Unsure: The public is sceptical about David Cameron's motives for backing the new laws - only one in seven says he is doing it because he thinks it is right in principle

Survation pollster Damian Lyons Lowe said: ‘The results suggest  Mr Cameron’s supporters are increasingly socially liberal. If he changes his mind, traditionally minded Conservatives who have defected to UKIP and other parties may return to the fold, but others who like his more progressive approach may walk out.’ 

The increasing acceptance of gay rights is reflected in the two-to-one support for the claim that to deny same-sex couples the right to  marry is discrimination. Welsh Tory MP David Davies caused controversy last week by claiming most parents preferred their children not to be gay, partly so they could have grandchildren.

A total of 53 per cent said they agreed with Mr Davies, with 41 per cent against.

Many gay marriage critics have said a marriage cannot be sacred between two people of the same sex. A total of 42 per cent agreed – 42 per cent said they disagreed. The Government’s plan to allow gay marriages in churches, with the exception of the Church of England, is rejected by voters.

While nearly six in ten say the Church of England has every right to oppose gay marriages, only one in three says Mr Cameron is right  to ban the C  of  E from conducting gay marriages.

More than half say the C  of  E vicars should be allowed to conduct gay marriages if they wish to. But regardless of their opinion on gay marriage, most people think MPs should focus on more important matters.

Fewer than one in four say it is a priority for Parliament; more than 60 per cent say it does not deserve such attention.

Survation interviewed 1,003 people online on Friday and yesterday.
