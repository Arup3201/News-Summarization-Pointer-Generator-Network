A brother who branded his sister 'too lazy' to work forged his dying mother’s will to deny her a share of the fortune.

Benefits dependent Christine Watts, 47, was accused of unreasonably fighting for half her mother's estate as she 'did nothing to get a job' for nine years while waiting for inheritance.

But it has emerged her brother Gary, 44, forged their mother's signature on a deathbed will, which left Christine, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, nothing.

Won: Christine Watts, 47, was accused of unreasonably fighting for half her mother's estate after finding she had been left with nothing. Today a judge ruled her brother Gary, 44, had forged the will to take the entire estate

When their mother Valerie died of cancer aged 71 in January 
2011, it emerged she made a last-minute amendment to the will, leaving 
their entire £200,000 estate to her son.

However, a court has found Mr Watts fabricated the document to get her life savings and the family home in Kent to himself.

Rejecting the 2011 document in favour of a 1999 will, Judge Catherine Newman QC ruled Mr Watts had pressurised a nurse into bearing witness to the forged will.

The siblings have now been granted half each.

Judge Catherine Newman QC said: 'Gary signed it, not Valerie, and he simulated his mother’s signature on it.'

Both siblings had been adopted by Valerie and her then-husband Leonard - Miss Watts from a children’s home in 1967 when she was 10 months old; Mr Watts three years later, before his first birthday.

Mr Watts told the court he deserved every penny for the years he spent caring for their mother.

The inheritance, to be split between the pair, amounts to £200,000 from a house in Kent and some savings

The judge said: 'His view was that he had got what he deserved, and so had Christine, and he did not think that she deserved to get anything from their mother’s estate.'

But Miss Watts who has survived on benefits since giving up her work as an underwriter told the judge: 'I need money for living expenses.'

Her counsel Jordan Holland had told the judge she had back problems and psychological issues which made it impossible for her to work. She was 'dependent' on her late mother even though she was an adult.

She denied she had been waiting for her mother’s death to save her from dire financial straits.

But Mr Watts' counsel Neil McLarnon accused her of not making any effort to find work.

The court found Mr Watts enlisted the support of an aunt who showed 'animosity' to Christine to sign the will

She replied: ‘I feel that, if I take a job, I would not be able to commit to it because of taking time off sick and it wouldn’t be fair.’

Mr Watts told the court his mother first wanted to cut Miss Watts out of her will in 2006 but he persuaded her not to.

He said the deathbed will was her 'final wish' because 'she was disappointed with her not showing any concern for her, not coming up and visiting her.'

But one of the witnesses nurse Jackie Brown said she was tricked by Gary into signing the document, she never knew was a will and never saw Valerie sign it as required by law.

The other witness to the will was Valerie’s sister Yvonne who was an 'unsatisfactory' witness who showed 'animosity' to Christine, and claimed her sister died 'heartbroken' because of her daughter’s failure to extend her any affection, said the judge. She claimed the 2011 will was what her sister wanted.
