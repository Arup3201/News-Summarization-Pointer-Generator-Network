The hawk that patrols the skies over Wimbledon to deter pigeons has been stolen.

The American Harris hawk, named Rufus, was taken together with its cage and  handling glove overnight between Thursday and Friday from a car parked in Wimbledon. Rufus was in the car on a  private driveway in Dunstall Road with its rear window open for ventilation.

For the past four years, the hawk has spent every morning of the Championships scaring pigeons away from the hallowed grass.

Owner Imogen Davis, 25,  said she was still in shock after Rufus’s disappearance. ‘It’s really, really sad,’ she said.

‘He was taken in his travelling box, 
which is where he sleeps because it’s nice and dark and cool and he can 
fall asleep in there.

‘We’re very shocked – we just want to know that he is OK.’

Ms Davis said Rufus was reared by the family-run business, Avian Environmental Consultants.

She added: ‘We work as a team together. To have him taken away like that is just  horrible.

‘It’s a family business, the birds are brought up around us. They’re part of the family. It’s just the way it is.’

Pigeons are not the Harris Hawk's natural prey, and they are trained not to attack but to circle and fly around the courts to scare the birds

Ms Davis said she originally thought 
it was a prank, but was not sure as a falconry glove and falconry hood 
were stolen at the same time.

‘Initially I was almost hoping that it
was a prank because there was more possibility of us getting him back, 
and somebody would realise it was a  stupid thing to do,’ she added.

‘But because the hood and the glove were taken, I’m not sure. I suppose at least it means he’s being looked after.

‘We have another hawk and we can still do our job but we would like Rufus back because we’re very fond of him.’

Bird's-eye view: Rufus even has his own pass for Wimbledon which reads: Bird Scarer

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 
‘Rufus is also a  family pet and the family has become very attached to 
the bird.

'They are distressed over the theft and are appealing for help 
to recover the bird.’

Rufus has become a well-known fixture 
at the South-West London tennis club, with visitors often stopping to 
ask for photos with the hawk.

He even has his own Twitter account, but there has not been a tweet for a day.

His last tweet was before Rafael 
Nadal’s shock exit from the tournament, when he said: ‘Murray is 
through, Rafa is down 2-1 (!), Ward played  brilliantly but lost to 
Mardy Fish, and Italy are beating Germany 1-0!’
