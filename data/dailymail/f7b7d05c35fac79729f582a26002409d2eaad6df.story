A rat was caught on camera running aggressively toward a man at a New York City subway stop.

YouTube user Josiah Ryan shared a video of his encounter with the large rodent on Sunday.

In the video, the rat scurries along the platform - but is off-camera as the camera wobbles and Ryan yells 'Ah! Oh s***!'

'Oh my God man, got it all on video, too,' Ryan is heard saying in the clip.

At TheBlaze, Ryan wrote 'Late Friday evening, TheBlaze late-night editor Oliver Darcy and I were headed downtown after celebrating his birthday at an establishment near the newsroom when we encountered an enormous New York City rat loitering on the platform, possibly awaiting the D train.'

He wrote that the incident 'permanently shook my faith in the détente I once thought existed between man and beast in New York City.'

The title for Ryan's video indicated that his encounter occurred at the Bryant Park stop on 42nd street. It serves the B, D, F, V and 7 lines.

WPIX reported that Ryan avoided the rat while standing on the platform.

'I admit it wasn't my finest moment,' he told the affiliate station of his fright.

Ryan also told WPIX 'This incident is going to haunt me for a little while now and I’m gonna be more likely to grab a Citibike and head downtown instead of taking the subway.'
