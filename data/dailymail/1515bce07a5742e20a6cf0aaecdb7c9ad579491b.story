A wife who is standing by her teacher husband after he took a 16-year-old pupil's virginity in a school store cupboard has been suspended from her own job as acting headteacher amid complaints from parents.

Religious studies teacher Stuart Kerner, 44, was spared jail despite being convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child after a judge controversially suggested the victim may have 'groomed him'.

Kerner's wife, Katherine, is standing by him, but now worried mothers are pulling children out of the school where she works as an acting headteacher.

Mrs Kerner, who took on the role at Wyborne Primary School, Greenwich, before Christmas but has now been placed on 'enforced leave', while council chiefs establish whether she should be allowed to continue working with children. 

Under the Childcare (Disqualification) Regulations 2009, a person can be banned from working with children aged under eight 'by association', if they live in the same household as another person who is disqualified lives or works.

Father-of-one Kerner, who was vice principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London, was banned from working with children and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register after he was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.

Inner London Crown Court was told that Kerner took the then 16-year-old's virginity in a store cupboard the same week his wife miscarried and later had sex with her at his family home. 

His defence had tried to claim the victim had invented a fantasy relationship based on the novel Fifty Shades Of Grey, in which an older, more experienced man has an affair with a younger woman.

He was cleared of four other charges of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, and two counts of sexual activity with a child, which were said to have happened when the victim was 15.

Judge Joanna Greenberg QC suspended his 18 month prison sentence, telling him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her... It was she who groomed you and you gave in to temptation.'

Mrs Kerner had sobbed as her husband had spared jail, as she had when the 'guilty' verdict was read out, causing her to flee from the court.

'She's destroyed our lives,' she had said of the victim. 'This is a miscarriage of justice, she's a liar'.

Edward Ellis, defending, had told sentencing hearing last week: 'Mrs Kerner herself is on enforced leave.

'It is highly likely she will have her position reviewed quite closely.'

During the trial, Mr Ellis said of Mrs Kerner: 'She has been supporting her husband, the man she fell in love with 25 years ago. She gave him a son which Mr Kerner dotes on.' 

Kerner's guilty verdict was met with anger and fear by parents at Wyborne Primary, some of whom have applied for their children to be transferred to another school.

Parent Pearl Louge, 23, told local paper News Shopper that she wanted to move her six-year-old daughter Remi-Leigh.

 'I don't feel Mrs Kerner should be left to be working around children and she should not be allowed back at the school,' she said. 

'What kind of message would it send out to keep her on?'

Another parent, Charlotte Carter, 24, said her five-year-old son Frankee had been badly affected as his class teacher Gillian Efford has now had to take over as acting head in place of Mrs Kerner 

'Mrs Kerner should definitely not have been promoted to headteacher when she's living with a person who's been found guilty of sleeping with a pupil,' she said.

'I'm training to be a teaching assistant so I know anybody who lives with someone who has abused a young person should not be allowed to work with children.'

A Greenwich Council spokesman told MailOnline: 'Safeguarding of children is a priority for us at all times, and all staff working in our schools are subject to full safeguarding checks in line with legislation and Ofsted guidance. 

'It is not appropriate to comment on employment issues relating to any individual member of staff, and the criminal case referred to is not a matter for the council or the school to comment on. 

'We encourage any parents who have concerns on behalf of their children to contact their school to discuss those concerns.'
