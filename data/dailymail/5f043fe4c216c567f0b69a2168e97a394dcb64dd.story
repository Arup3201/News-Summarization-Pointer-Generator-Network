British Gas broke into the home of Stephanie MacDonald-Walker, pictured, to cut off her gas supply even though her property didn't have one

British Gas has been forced to apologise to a businesswoman after the company broke into her home to switch off a gas supply that didn't even exist.

Stephanie MacDonald-Walker was stunned when she came home to find a worker from the energy giant had forced his way into her flat in an attempt to fit a pre-payment meter.

The fashion boutique owner moved into the property in Stoneygate, Leicester, four months ago, and received a letter addressed to a previous occupier claiming there was an unpaid gas bill of £367.

She called British Gas to say there was no gas supply at her home - and was told not to worry as there must have been a mistake.

But when Ms Macdonald-Walker returned from running her boutique in Leicester last week, she found a card left by British Gas which stated: 'We entered your home with a warrant to either fit a pay-as-you-go meter or disconnect your gas/electricity supply.'

The company has now apologised and blamed a 'wrong meter reference' for the blunder.

But Ms Macdonald-Walker described the actions of the company as 'disgraceful'. She said: 'I can't believe what they have done.

'I told them I had no gas supply at my flat so the unpaid bill had absolutely nothing to do with me.

'Despite all this information, they chose to break into my home while I was out at work.

'They left a note in my apartment explaining they had entered but couldn't find the gas to turn off and would I call them immediately.

'Their behaviour has been disgraceful. They did not listen to me at all. If they had done, none of this would have happened.'

Ms Macdonald-Walker told how she called British Gas to set up an account for electricity after moving in and paid her first bill on time after reading her own meter.

She added: 'In August, I got a letter addressed to the occupier of my flat saying there was an outstanding gas bill of £367.

'I called the British Gas helpline immediately and told them it was not my bill and there was no gas supply at my flat.

'The woman on the end of the phone said it must have been a mistake and told me not to worry about it.

Ms Macdonald-Walker said she forgot about the letter until she came home from work on September 17 to find a note from British Gas informing her that they had entered her home. 

The note: British gas left this note at the home of Stephanie MacDonald-Walker after the broke in to turn off a gas supply she'd already informed them her flat didn't have

She added: 'I got home at about 6pm to find a card in my house from someone saying they were from British Gas and they had entered my property.

'There was a small hole in the door and neighbours told me a locksmith came to gain access. It sent a shiver down my spine to know someone had been into my flat.

Under the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954 an official of a gas or electricity company can enter a private residence in certain situations and under certain conditions.

They can enter a home if a magistrate has given the official a warrant authorising them to enter to either inspect, substitute, remove or to re-install a meter, to alter or repair supply lines or pipes and other fittings or to disconnect the supply.

In order to obtain a warrant, the official must show that the homeowner has been given at least twenty-four hours' notice, has already refused the energy company representative admission to the property, or that the building is unoccupied.

Entry must be at a reasonable time and the official must leave the house as secure against trespassers as it was when he or she arrived.

'Apart from anything else, my neighbours must have seen them forcing their way into my flat with me not there.

'What must they think of me? I am self-employed businesswoman and this happened through no fault of my own.

'I now feel paranoid about being in this flat. I cannot exaggerate just how badly this has affected me and how strongly I feel about the way British Gas has behaved.'

Under the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954, energy operators can obtain a warrant from a magistrate giving them permission to enter a person's home in certain circumstances.

British Gas said it applied to the courts for a warrant to enter Ms Macdonald-Walker's flat 'in error' as it held the wrong meter reference for her home.

Spokeswoman Leonie Edwards said: 'I am very sorry we entered Ms MacDonald-Walker's flat in error.

'As soon as we entered her property and saw there was no meter, we left and secured her home.

'We are investigating this as a matter of urgency and have contacted Ms MacDonald-Walker to apologise.'
