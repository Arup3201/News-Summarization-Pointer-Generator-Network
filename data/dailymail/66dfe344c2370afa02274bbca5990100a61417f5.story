A footballer jailed for killing a brother and sister in a high-speed crash has likened his sentence to a sports injury.

Courtney Meppen-Walter, who played for Manchester City and captained the England under-18 team, bragged in a letter that his time in prison was a ‘minor’ matter.

The 19-year-old was freed this month after serving just eight months for killing Kulwant Singh, 31, and Ravel Kaur, 37, in the smash.

A letter apparently written by Courtney Meppen-Walter (pictured) while he was in prison has emerged in which the footballer compares his sentence to an 'injury'

The letter which appears to have been written by Meppen-Walter in April while he was serving his sentence

But in a letter written from behind bars in April, Meppen-Walter shows no remorse for his offence.

It read: ‘Yo, it’s a minor being in 
here, you know just like having a 4-month injury for me. Only 3 months 
left for me now, nice that!’

He also said he had lost weight and was 
considering a career in modelling on his release.

The letter was given to a newspaper but it is not clear who it was sent to.

Meppen-Walter was freed in July but 
was put back behind bars within 24 hours after prison chiefs realised he
 had been released by mistake.

At the time, he had served just four 
months of a 16-month sentence for two counts of causing death by 
careless driving.

Associates say he is looking for a new club and wants 
to ‘get his life back on track’ after Manchester City terminated his 
contract.

But relatives of his victims say they feel failed by the justice system.

Gawa Singh, who is Kulwant and Ravel’s
 brother, said: ‘The sentence that Courtney Meppen-Walter has served is 
nothing compared to the loss that our family have suffered.

‘It is not justice as we understand it. Two members of our family have died. It has torn our family apart.’

The tragedy happened last September 
when Meppen-Walter was driving a £25,000 Mercedes at nearly twice the 
speed limit.

He had been to a bar in Manchester with friends and was on 
his way home to prepare for a night out.

His friends were travelling behind in a
 VW Golf and the two cars were ‘jockeying’ for position – accelerating 
and swapping lanes.

Meppen-Walter’s vehicle hit a red Nissan Micra 
driven by Kulwant Singh.

Two teenagers in the back seat were 
seriously injured.

The tragedy occurred five months after Meppen-Walter,
 from Blackley in Manchester, was caught speeding.
