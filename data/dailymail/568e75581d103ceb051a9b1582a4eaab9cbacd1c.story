The chairman of the House panel responsible for green-lighting war spending warned the Obama administration Thursday that ruling out 'boots on the ground' in the battle against ISIS if it formally asks Congress to authorize future military operations.

'I will not support sending our military into harm’s way with their arms tied behind their backs,' said Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, a California Republican who is in the last weeks before his retirement.

He warned during a committee hearing that regardless of who holds his gavel when a formal Authorization for Use of Military Force comes to Capitol Hill from the White House, 'should the AUMF proposed by the president contain such limitations it will be DOA in Congress.' 

Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said in the same hearing that Iraqi military forces are making progress restoring order in the Northern city of Mosul and re-establishing the country's border with Syria.

As those operations gain traction, he said, the 'boots on the ground' question could be re-opened.

'I'm not predicting at this point that I would recommend that those forces in Mosul and along the border would need to be accompanied by U.S. forces, but we're certainly considering it,' Dempsey told lawmakers.

Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, issued a pointed warning that Congress would refuse to sign a permission slip for war unless the option of using ground troops were left on the table

'WE'RE CERTAINLY CONSIDERING IT': Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers he was open to the idea of recommending US ground troops to Obama

As it conducts a long-term military operation to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), the Obama administration has been relying on an AUMF hastily passed in the weeks following al-Qaeda's September 11, 2001 terror attacks on New York City and the Pentagon – and on an Iraq war resolution passed in 2003.

Now, however, the enemy is ISIS, a Muslim caliphate that has rampaged across two-thirds of Syria and Iraq. Its members were expelled from al-Qaeda and the older terror group regards ISIS fighters as apostates. 

The result has been a White House that is relying on a battlefield permission-slip that many in Congress say is ill-fitting and obsolete.

The administration has asked for $5.6 billion in new defense spending authority, raising eyebrows and new questions on the Hill as Obama pledged to double the U.S. military presence in the ISIS war while simultaneously claiming there would be no American battle engagement.

McKeon warned Gen. Dempsey that 'limiting our advisers to headquarters buildings will not help newly trained Iraqi and Syrian opposition forces hold terrain, much less defeat [ISIS] in the field.'

'Yet the president has doubled down on his policy of 'no boots on the ground,' despite any advice you give him.' 

Texas Republican Rep. Mac Thornberry told Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that vague commitments from the White House has made it impossible for Congress to do its job.

'Until you get words on paper it's kinda hard to make progress,' Thornberry said.  

Hagel was noncommittal and said the White House was internally debating whether it needs a new AUMF from lawmakers – and how a request should be worded.  

'I don't know specifically what they are going to propose,' he said. 'I don't know specifically if they are going to send it up as a legislative proposal.'

'I know the president has had specific conversations with specific members of both the House and Senate on this.'

Senate Democrats have found their voices since their Election Day drubbing, and have spent much of the last week demanding a vote on a new AUMF before Republicans take over committee chairmanships and swear in a new majority in January.

On Wednesday at the Woodrow WIlson Center in Washington, D.C., Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine complained that the U.S. has been 'engaged in a war – that is not about imminent defense of the United States – without legal authority.'

In a statement after the election, Kaine said he was 'troubled by suggestions ... that Congress should wait until the new Congressional session in 2015 to take this vote.'

'We have already asked too many U.S. service members to risk their lives without a political consensus behind this mission,' he said.

Republicans like North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones insist that anti-ISIS airstrikes are illegal without a congressional go-ahead.

'This is nothing more than an abdication of our constitutional responsibility,' he said Thursday.

But moments later he hinted that many Republicans would play a dovish role unless the Obama administration clearly defined victory while asking for billions of dollars to achieve it.

'For goodness sakes, why in the world should be make such a commitment, and we don't even have an endpoint for it?'

'What is the end-state of what we are trying to accomplish?' he asked. 'I don't know how we convince the American people that a nation which is financially broke ... where is it coming from? Please explain to the Congress and the American people how it ends one day?'

Hagel insisted that ISIS 'continues to represent a serious threat to American interests, our allies, and the Middle East ... and wields influence over a broad swath of territory in western and northern Iraq and eastern Syria.'
