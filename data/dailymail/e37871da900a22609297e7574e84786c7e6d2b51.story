ITV bosses are to turn back the clock to celebrate 'old skool' children's shows by screening two full days of classic programmes next month.

Popular shows of yesteryear such as Count Duckula, Press Gang, Art Attack and The Tomorrow People are to be brought back to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Children's ITV.

Digital channel CITV will devote its schedules on January 5 and 6 to screen eight-and-a-half hours each day of past favourites.

Back on the air: Hit TV programme Rainbow, featuring (l-r) Bungle, George, Geoffrey and Zippy, ran for 20 years and more than 1,000 shows between 1972 and 1992

Adding some colour: The original series of Art Attack ran from 1990 to 2007 and was presented throughout by Neil Buchanan (above). The new series launched on Disney Junior on June 6, 2011

Programmes will also include Super Gran, The Raggy Dolls and Puddle Lane as well as Rosie & Jim, Rainbow and Children's Ward, which helped to launch the writing careers of Russell T Davies and Paul Abbott.

As well as the Old Skool Weekend of programmes, ITV1 will air a documentary celebrating the 30th anniversary of CITV.

Jamila Metran, CITV's head of programming, said: 'We are very proud of CITV's heritage and look forward to bringing back all the old favourites for this one-off, not-to-be-missed event and show the kids what their parents watched when they were young.'

Before being known as Children's ITV, the timeslot for children's programmes on the ITV Network was for a short time branded as Watch IT!, which started in December 1980.

Canal capers: Rosie & Jim (above), which featured the adventures of two ragdolls on a narrowboat along the waterways of central England, ran from September 1990 to December 2000

Blast from the past: Science fiction series The Tomorrow People, starring actress Sammie Winmill and Derek Crewe (pictured), featured characters who developed special powers. The programme had separate runs in the 1970s, 80s and 2000s

It was presented by the live continuity announcer in each ITV region.

In 1983, the children's teatime slot 
was the first to be nationalised, with a number of presenters such as 
Matthew Kelly and Isla St Clair introducing the shows.

CITV launched on January 3, 1983 with
guest presenters such as Roland Rat, Basil Brush and Timmy Mallett 
recording introductions to programmes. The CITV channel launched in 
2006.

CITV airs on Saturday and Sunday mornings on the ITV network from 6am to 9.25am.
