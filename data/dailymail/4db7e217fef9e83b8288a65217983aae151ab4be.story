The drive to find £20 billion of efficiency savings in the NHS is threatening patient care as medical staff struggle to cope with frontline cuts, it was claimed today.

Retired obstetrician Lord Patel told ministers there is now a shortfall of 4,500 to 5,000 midwives in the United Kingdom with half of the workforce aged between 45 and 55.

In a Lords debate on nursing, he said: 'Recruitment of a younger workforce is
extremely important.

Future of care? Half of midwives are now aged between 45 and 55

'There is a need to address the issue of
a midwife shortage if we are going to deliver quality care to mothers 
and their children.'

Labour's Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe added that cuts in nursing staff could have 'disastrous consequences' for patient care.

She said: 'Frontline nursing care is being severely threatened by the £20 billion efficiency savings target set for the NHS.'

Analysis by the Royal College of Nursing suggested that across 41 NHS trusts in England, registered nurses and health care assistants accounted for 34 per cent of posts 'earmarked to be cut'.

Lady Warwick said: 'Despite Government promises that there would be no cuts to frontline NHS care, clinical services and staffing levels are being severely affected.'

Pre-registration nursing places for new entrants were also being cut, she said.

'These cuts to existing posts and new entrants will have potentially disastrous consequences for patient care.

'We must have sufficient nurses and they must be properly equipped and supported to provide skilled care.'

Independent crossbencher Baroness Masham of Ilton, a former regional health authority member, said patient care was being compromised.

'We must have sufficient nurses and they must be properly equipped and supported to provide skilled care.'

'When nurses retire they are not being replaced,' she said.

Anecdotal evidence suggested the district nursing service was being 'stretched to the point of providing a bare minimum service in many areas.'

Lady Masham also warned that a 'culture of indifference' to patients seemed to have crept into the nursing profession.

She blamed a 'lack of leadership' and called for the return of the 'old type matron' to ensure hospital wards were better run.

Lady Warwick said she was 'horrified' by recent stories of neglect of patients but insisted that claims of graduate nurses being 'too posh to wash' those in their care did not stand up.

Rejecting the suggestion that graduate nurses thought it 'beneath them to clean-up for the vulnerable and sick in their care', she said studies suggested they spent longer hours in clinical areas than their non-graduate counterparts.

'There isn't and shouldn't be a distinction between... professional academic head and caring heart,' she added.

Labour spokesman Lord MacKenzie of Culkein, a former nurse, warned the Government's policies may have put 'a match to a slow-burning fuse'.

He said: 'Morale has been hit from a number of areas: the growing public perception that nurses are not capable of compassionate care, the two-year pay freeze and the pension issue, the down-grading of posts, the actual and forecast staffing reductions coming from the Royal College of Nursing and Unison.'

Responding to the debate, Health minister Earl Howe, said he emphatically rejected the 'inflated' figures produced by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) which were 'based on an analysis of just 41 trusts'.

'The trusts mentioned in the report have actually disputed the RCN's figures,' he said.

'The RCN haven't offered commentary on the fact that some of these plans are about moving services out into the community to provide better care for people when and where they need it.

'We're not disputing that some trusts have reduced their number of staff - some have - although many of these are support staff and often it has been done through natural turnover.'

He said it was up to local trusts to determine their staffing needs and any reduction in clinical posts 'must not have an adverse impact on the quality and safety of patient care'.

Lord Howe told Lord Patel that the Government was not reducing the number of midwife training places, with a record high of 2,507 available this year.

'The Government is committed to ensuring we have the right number of trained midwives, especially given the increased number and complexity of births in recent years,' he said.
