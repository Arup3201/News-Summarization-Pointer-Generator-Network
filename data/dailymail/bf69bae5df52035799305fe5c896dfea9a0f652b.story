A study from the University of Washington that polled 127 Snapchat users ages 18 and over found that 60 percent of respondents used Snapchat primarily to send 'funny content'

Snapchat may have a reputation as a sexting app for teens, but in reality, you're far more likely to find cat pictures and selfies, researchers have found.

A study from the University of Washington polled 127 Snapchat users ages 18 and over.

It found that 60% of respondents used Snapchat primarily to send 'funny content,' while the second most popular type of 'snap' is a selfie.

Fourteen percent of those surveyed said they'd previously sent sexts over Snapchat, but just 1.6 percent said they do so regularly.

Snapchat, which allows people to exchange messages that self-destruct seconds after they're viewed, has attracted an estimated 82 million users, most of whom are between ages 13 and 25.

The survey also found that many users did not care about relative insecurity of pictures sent using the app.

'We surveyed 127 adult Snapchatusers, finding that security is not a major concern for the majority of these respondents,' the researchers wrote.

'We learn that most do not use Snapchat to sendsensitive content (although up to 25% may do so experimentally), that taking screenshots is not generally a violation of the sender's trust but instead common and expected, that most respondents understand that messages can be recovered, and that security and privacy concerns are overshadowed by other influences on how and why respondents choose to use or not use Snapchat.'

Snapchat, which allows people to exchange messages that self-destruct seconds after they're viewed, has attracted an estimated 82 million users, most of whom are between ages 13 and 25.

At the end of 2013 it was estimated that Snapchat had over 26 million users in the US alone, with many others around the world.And in a survey of American college students in February, 77% said they used Snapchat on a daily basis.But the company still apparently holds only 5% of the 'selfie' market, with this move perhaps an attempt to keep them in the game.

The team also found the majority of users tried the app because they thought it would be fun - rather than actually wanting to send salacious material.

'Respondents more commonly respond that they use Snapchat because it is fun, not because of its implied or actual security properties.

'Indeed, most respondents understand that Snapchat's message destruction is insecure, but they do not send sensitive messages (such as sexual or legally questionable content) more commonly because they don't produce such content than because they don't trust Snapchat or their friends.'

A majority of respondents in the UW study (53 percent) had screen shots taken of their messages at some point, and slightly fewer (47 percent) had taken screen shots themselves.

Five people admitted to using a separate camera to photograph a message, which prevents the sender from knowing his or her photo was captured.

However, most people didn't seem to mind that their 'snaps' were saved.

When asked how they reacted to having a screen shot taken of their message, respondents "more commonly chose answer choices indicating neutral ('didn't care') or positive ('thought it was funny') reactions," according to the report.

Despite the relative infrequency of sexting among the survey's sample of users, the researchers found that Snapchat has a reputation for illicit messages that was discouraging some from downloading the app.

Among the 61 people who started the survey but failed to complete it because they hadn't used Snapchat, several expressed concerns about the 'additional connotations' of the app.

Snapchat 'has a bad reputation (for sexting),' said one.

Another said it 'seems useful for only inappropriate content.'

The researchers alos said they believed that there was a market for a more secure chat app.

'Nevertheless, we observe that a non-negligible fraction (but not a majority) of respondents adapt their behavior in response to Snapchat's weak security properties, and thus conclude that these users may still have a use for a more secure messaging application in addition to the more casual, fun-focused Snapchat.
