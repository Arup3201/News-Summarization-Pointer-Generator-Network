Coming out can be incredibly hard for gay people to do - the fear of how family and friends will react often delays announcement for years, or even decades. 

But for Vicky Beeching, the decision to tell the world she was a lesbian wasn't just about telling her nearest and dearest, it was was also going to risk shattering her income and having her deported from the country she lived in. 

For over a decade, the 35-year-old's music has been played across America's bible belt as a soundtrack to modern Christianity. 

From the age of fourteen, the Brit had been travelling to perform the religious music she wrote at concerts and churches from her family home in Kent. 

Vicky has written and performed her own Christian music from a very young age, she eventually became one of the biggest religious music stars in the US 

After undertaking a Theology degree at Oxford, the success of Vicky's songs took her to across the pond to Nashville, where she got a record contract and proceeded to become a big name in religious music. 

But despite her career success, the Londoner never had a chance to enjoy how well she was doing, because she was constantly hiding a huge secret - the fact that she is attracted to women. 

She said: 'My income comes from churches - they have to pay a fee to use my music, so that paid my rent and put food on the table. 

Vicky traveled across both the UK and America playing her tracks in churches, concerts and rallies  

'Even when I first spoke out in support of same-sex marriage, I was boycotted by certain churches. 

'They told me that because I supported equal marriage, my songs were now polluted.

'I knew that saying anything about my sexuality to anyone would make my world crumble. 

'While I was living in America, even my immigration visa was tied into me doing the specific job of performing in churches, so I could have been deported from the country if people had chosen to stop booking me.' 

Being torn between the church and her sexuality was nothing new to Vicky. 

From a young age, she realised that the way she felt about her own sex wasn't acceptable in Christianity.  

Aged just 13, she approached a Catholic priest to confess how she felt and he prayed for her to be forgiven. 

Sadly, this only made her feel worse, to the extent that she broke down in her bedroom that year and sobbed over how helpless she was to change a key part of herself that her faith believed was bad.

Three years later, she attended a Christian youth camp in the English countryside and made the only other attempt at reaching out that she would do before turning 30. 

At the camp, she decided to take part in an exorcism that would cleanse her of being attracted to women. 

As she stood on stage in front of thousands of people, Christian leaders shouted and screamed in tongues and called for the demons to come out of her, for the devils to leave her body.

The experience traumatised Vicky enough to stop her mentioning anything about being gay for another 14 years.

She said: "The hardest part was that they made me feel like there was something evil in me taking me over, that I was being taken over by demonic powers.

'These were really important Christian leaders in the community carrying out this exorcism and saying these things to me. 

'Later that night, a girl got up who must've been about 18 - two years older than me - and spoke about how she had been set free and cured of being gay. 

'That made me convinced that it would work for me, but two weeks later I still felt the same way. 

'The thing is, you can't feel bad towards the people who did it, because the really had the best intention in the world by wanting to set me free.' 

So Vicky hid how she felt for years, while travelling America's bible belt to perform at churches and rallys - places where anti-gay sentiment was rife. 

She said: 'A lot of churches that I would play at in America would say that homosexuality was something that the devil had designed to end the world by stopping people from procreating. 

'There would be big billboards on the roads saying things like 'Turn Or Burn'. 

Since deciding to come out at the age of 35, Vicky feels like she is looking at life in a completely different way. She said: "I feel like I have been given a second chance at life." 

'If I was still living in America, I could never have had the courage to do this, I would have had a genuine fear for my safety.' 

The turning point came when she was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease called linear scleroderma morphea, aged 30, where the soft tissue in the body turns to scarring. 

The disease can often be linked to a point of stress - in Vicky's case she assumed it was her hidden sexuality.  

While undergoing severe hospital treatments including chemotherapy, she decided to set herself an age when she would tell people she was a lesbian - that age would be 35. 

She said: 'So that's why I have decided to come out now, because I made a decision when I was very ill about coming out when I turned 35. 

'And it just so happens that almost a month ago today,the Church Of England voted in favour women bishops. 

Vicky is now setting out a second career path as a religious commentator and hopes coming out will help the Church of England to get behind same-sex marriages 

'The next hurdle is the issue of same sex marriage - I'm hoping seeing people like me will help that. 

'I think it will be a slow change, but it will happen faster than women bishops took. It will happen by listening to LGBT Christians, by putting faces to something instead of just looking at theology.' 

I told my parents at Easter, so they haven't have very long to get used to everything, but hey were great though, they said that they don't have to choose between agreeing and loving me.' 

It is less than 24 hours since she came out to the general public, but Vicky said she has been stunned by the response from people.

She said: 'I've had people of very different faiths write to me overnight to say they don't necessarily agree with me, but they still love me. 

'That's a wonderful things to be told. 

After being given the all-clear from her illness, Vicky is now looking forward to the next stage of her life. She said: "Doing all of this is that it gives me the hope that some day I can get married, because until now I didn't think that was possible." 

'Obviously I have had some messages from the very conservative Christians which aren't so nice, but I am choosing not to read them for the time being. I need to be strong right now and the lovely messages I am getting are giving me so much strength.' 

One of the best messages was from Katherine Welby and her father Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who Vicky knows very well. 

She said: 'Katherine told me told me that the whole family have said that I am just as welcome at their dinner table and they still love me. 

I'm actually going round there for dinner next week.' 

'The exciting thing about doing all of this is that it gives me the hope that some day I can get married, because until now I didn't think that was possible. 

'And I'm fully in remission now from my illness and have been given the all-clear. 

'I feel like I have been given a second chance at life.'
