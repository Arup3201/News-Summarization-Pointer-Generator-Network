For most people, a trip to the shops involves a few cars, pedestrians and perhaps a couple of stray dogs.

But locals strolling in Finland and Russia were recently greeted by a more unusual sight - two moose.

One of the runaway elk spent a staggering seven hours dashing through the streets of Helsinki yesterday.

Moose on the loose: A runaway elk was captured dashing through the streets of Helsinki in Finland yesterday

The animal was first spotted at around 3am (1am GMT) and later captured hurtling past a dog walker by local Sakarias Laukkanen.

Police were called and spent 'the rest of the night' chasing the 'erratically-behaved' animal, according to Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat. 

But unfortunately, at around 10am, they decided they had no choice but to shoot and kill the moose.

A police spokesman said: 'They had been hoping to spare the animal by directing him towards the sea so it could swim away.'

Another escapee: It comes just weeks after a drunken moose, named Monty, was spotted running trough Semenov, Russia, after eating a pile of fermented berries. Above, the animal eventually fell into a pond

Rescue: The pond's concrete sides made it impossible for Monty to climb back out, but he was saved from drowning after police took to the water with a rope. Unfortunately, his Finnish brother was shot by police

But one
 resident in Helsinki, which has a population of only around 600,000, appeared less sympathetic about the animal's demise.

She told the paper: 'It just shows what a small rural town Helsinki 
is. I've just told my neighbour - make sure your freezer is empty as there is so much fresh meat on offer.'

Meanwhile, the other moose, named Monty, was spotted on the loose in 
Semenov, near Russia's Volga River, last month after chomping his way through on a pile 
of fermented berries.

The drunken animal was caught on camera running through the 
streets, before plunging into a pond in the middle of the city.

Saved: Semenov police officer Pavel Mihachkov said Monty had appeared 'bonkers on booze' during the chase

The pond's concrete sides made it impossible for him to climb back out, but he was saved from drowning after police took to the water with a rope.

Semenov police officer Pavel Mihachkov said that moose - which can reach almost 7ft tall and weigh up to 1,500lbs - tend to gravitate towards the first fruit falls at this time of year. 

Apples, cherries, apricots and 
other assorted fruits fall from trees during storms, ferment on the 
ground and become an intoxicating brew for such creatures, he said.

Mr Michachkov said Monty had appeared 'bonkers on booze', adding: 'It was a magnificent specimen but he 
was so sozzled he could barely stand.

'He obviously found a bunch of 
fermenting berries or something and really went for it.

'We
 managed to rope him and get him transported to an animal shelter for 
the night where he slept it off.

'Vets said the moose had the mother and 
father of all hangovers the next day but he will soon be ok.

'He will be 
tranquillised and driven out to a remote spot where it is hoped he won't
 find his way back to the big city any time soon.'

Despite Monty's plight, it is unlikely he will learn his lesson.

Experts calculate moose like him get 'drunk' around 50 times in their lives.
