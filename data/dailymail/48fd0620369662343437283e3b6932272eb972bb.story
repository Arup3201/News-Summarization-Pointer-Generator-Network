A 16-year-old girl who was raped and then had pictures of her naked body posted to social media has been trolled by vile internet users who have mocked her pose in the photos.

The sick internet trolls have mimicked the girl, only identified as Jada, by taking photos copying the position of her limp body and posting them to Twitter and Vine using the hashtag '#jadapose'.

Many of the images have since been removed - and other internet users have slammed their sick taunts and have jumped to her defense.

The cruel treatment comes after the teen bravely stepped forward and spoke out about the alleged attack in an interview with KHOU on Tuesday night.

Shared: Jada, a 16-year-old from Houston, Texas, claims she was drugged and raped at a high school party, and that pictures of her assault were then posted online

'There's no point in hiding,' she said 
in the interview. 'Everybody has already seen my face and my body, but 
that's not what I am and who I am.'

Jada told the station that she had attended a party with a friend, and thought it was just going to be kids hanging out.

But when she showed up, the teen boy hosting the party gave her a drink of punch she believes was spiked with some sort of drug.

Jada
 says she passed out and didn't know what happened for the rest of the 
night until after the party, when pictures of her body - stripped from 
the waist down - started appearing on social media.

She said she only found out she was raped when she saw the pictures.

Sick: After the images were put online, others copied her limp pose with the hashtag '#jadapose'

Cruel: In another, three boys reenact the pose that the victim was photographed making after the attack

Following the attack, Jada's peers mercilessly continued to spread the 
videos and pictures online - and since the interview, trolls have also started attacking her.

The Houston Press spoke to the creator of one video mocking the girl, and the teen said he posted the taunt on Tuesday when he was 'bored' and 'decided to wake up' his Twitter timeline.

He refused to give his real name and said he did not know Jada personally.

As the hashtag spread, other internet users decided to claim it as their own to throw support behind the teenage victim and lambast her attackers.

Harrowing tale: Jada said she attended a party, during which she believes someone spiked her drink and raped her after she passed out

'Houston 
loves and supports you, Jada,' Kia Hutch wrote on Twitter. 'Standing in 
solidarity #JusticeforJada #jadacounterpose #jadapose.'

In
 the interview with KHOU, Jada called for her attacker to be arrested, 
and said that she was angry and wants to be home-schooled in the fall.

Houston Police say they are now investigating Jada's claims.

Her
 heartbroken mother, who chose not to be identified, told KHOU: 'No 
one's daughter deserved this. No human being deserved this.'
