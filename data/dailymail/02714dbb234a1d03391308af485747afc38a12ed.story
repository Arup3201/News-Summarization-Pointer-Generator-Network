If you want to be among Britain’s best educated, you’d think that Oxford or Cambridge were the ideal places to find them.

However, yesterday the brainiest place in the country was named as the South-West London borough of Wandsworth.

According to the Office for National Statistics, 54 per cent of people living there have a university degree.

Although it has one of the lowest GCSE pass rates and one of the lowest life expectancy rates in the capital, it has been given a boost by young professionals flocking there for its low rents.

By contrast, 42.6 per cent of those living in Oxford and 47 per cent of those in Cambridge have a degree.

For decades, Wandsworth was the only place in the country that didn’t charge council tax and now its 300,000 residents still enjoy the lowest rate.

Wandsworth, London's largest borough by area, was a well-known slum before it was cleared in the late 20th Century.

The borough is also home to Wandsworth Prison, a category B mens institution which has the capacity to house over 1,000 inmates.

The second brainiest borough is more affluent Kensington and Chelsea, where 53 per cent of adults have a degree.

More than half of adults in Camden and Kingston also have a degree, but university-cities Cambridge and Oxford only house 47 per cent and 42.6 per cent graduate populations.
