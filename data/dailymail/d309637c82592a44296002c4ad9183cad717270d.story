Britain could face a series of ‘brownouts’ this winter that would dim household lights, National Grid admits.

Britain faces its greatest risk of power shortages in almost a decade, following the closure of coal-fired power stations to meet EU carbon targets.

The gap between winter supply and demand for electricity will be 4.1 per cent – the lowest level in eight years. However, this safety margin would be wiped out for some periods in December and January in the event of an extreme cold snap.

Keeping the lights on: A one-in-20-years cold snap would see Britain fail to meet basic reserves, a report warns today. It blamed recent shutdowns including after a fire at Ferrybridge Power Station, West Yorkshire (pictured)

The Grid has already made emergency plans to keep lights on – including paying factories to turn off machines during peak times.

Energy firms could also be bribed to switch on back-up power stations, under measures that will also be funded by their customers through higher bills.

Nevertheless, the organisation warns it may occasionally be necessary to ‘reduce voltage’ – causing so-called brownouts.

Energy experts say this would not only dim the lights but could also interfere with electronic equipment, computers and electric clocks.

The problems were detailed in National Grid’s Winter Outlook report, which states: ‘In the unlikely event that the amount of generation does not meet the amount of demand for a period of time, there are a number of enduring mitigating actions that National Grid can take.’

These could include ‘voltage reduction’, it adds.

Jeremy Nicholson of the Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents major manufacturers, said: ‘There was an obsession early on with being the greenest government ever.

‘We all want to see cleaner energy – who wouldn’t? – but it is becoming increasingly obvious that we want clean energy at a price we can afford.

‘We urgently need to be building new gas fired power stations and get cracking on the nuclear programme.’

Britain’s energy crisis has been exacerbated by a series of fires at power stations this year.

Four nuclear reactors were also shut down in August after investigators identified defects.

National Grid and politicians insist there is no chance of homes losing power altogether, with Energy Secretary Ed Davey guaranteeing: ‘There will be no blackouts. Period.’

Nuclear reactors including at Heysham, Lancashire, will only return to 75 per cent capacity, the report said

However, energy analyst Peter Atherton, of Liberum Capital, warned: ‘The calculations that National Grid has done are nothing like the worst-case scenario.

There may be false comfort from this.’

He said the Grid’s calculations assume that both nuclear reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool, currently offline for maintenance, are brought back into service before Christmas – and that there are no calm days on which wind turbines fail to generate electricity.

He added: ‘If we see brownouts, what you will notice is the lights going dimmer. But it plays havoc with electronic equipment such as computers and electronic clocks.’
