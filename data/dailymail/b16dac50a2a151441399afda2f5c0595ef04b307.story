The BBC has been criticised for airing an episode of Silent Witness in which a sniper killed eight people including a police officer on the same day 12 people were shot dead in a terror attack in France.

Last night's episode of the BBC One drama concluded with eight people being shot, including a female detective, and aired just hours after news of the targeted attack on Charlie Hebdo broke.

Some fans were angry, with some condemning the licence-funded corporation for airing the violent episode in the wake of the tragic attack which saw two gunmen storm the Paris offices of the French newspaper.

Last night's episode of BBC One's Silent Witness (above) featured eight people being shot, including a female detective, and aired just hours after the horrific terror attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris, France

The Silent Witness episode was aired on the same day 12 people were gunned down in Paris, France, in a terror attack. Two gunmen (pictured) stormed the offices of French newspaper Charlie Hebdo and opened fire

Several viewers took to Twitter last night to express shock and disappointed at the BBC for airing the episode

It was the second episode of Silent Witness to air this week, with the first part of the BBC drama – which aired on Tuesday - showing a gunman kill three people at a petrol station.

Today, it emerged that anti-terror police in France had swooped on a petrol station in the northern part of the country after two men 'armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers' stormed the garage and robbed it.

While that episode aired before the events in Paris yesterday unfolded, viewers took to Twitter last night to suggest the BBC was wrong for showing the second part – called 'Sniper's Nest' - and claimed it should have been postponed.

Twelve people – including two police officers - were gunned down in Paris yesterday after two armed gunmen stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo - the notoriously anti-Islamist satirical newspaper.

Using the #jesuischarlie hashtag – which was trending around the world on Twitter last night carrying messages of support and solidarity with the French victims – people blasted the BBC for showing the drama.

Dolly Belle said: 'Whoever at the @BBCOne who gave the green light for a gunman-themed episode of #SilentWitness was very misguided. #jesuischarlie (sic)'

Sally-Ann Burgon said: 'V disappointed in @BBCOne for choosing to show #SilentWitness tonight in light of today's events #ParisShooting #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie.'

Many viewers condemned the licence-funded corporation for airing the episode in the wake of the Paris terror attack, branding it 'insensitive' and 'misguided'. Others said they refused to watch the show out of respect

Mark Smith added: 'Really think @BBC should have pulled #SilentWitness because of #ParisShooting #JeSuisCharlie.'

Another Twitter user, writing under the name Angela, said: 'Somewhat surprised @BBCOne screening #SilentWitness tonight; #JeSuisCharlie.'

And Geoff Betteridge said: 'Why are BBC running Silent Witness? Very insensitive.'

Meanwhile, others refused to watch the BBC drama – which attracts about six million viewers – out of respect for the Paris victims.

John Ashton wrote: 'Won't be watching part 2 of #silentwitness tonight. Doesn't seem appropriate somehow. #JeSuisCharlie'

The BBC confirmed to MailOnline it had received at least 10 complaints over the content of last night's episode but said: 'The background and storyline in Silent Witness was very different to the tragic events in France'.

Those who sent messages to the BBC's Twitter account last night didn't receive a reply.

Prior to the show being screened last night, the actress wrote on Twitter: 'Tonight's episode of #silentwitness on @BBCOne about to start. Hope you enjoy conclusion! (sic)'

Following yesterday's attacks on Charlie Hebdo, in which two police officers and a number of journalists were killed by gunmen, another police officer was shot dead in northern France today.

The officer, who has not yet been named, died after being attacked just before dawn in Montrouge, a suburb in the south of the French capital.

This afternoon, armed anti-terror police swooped on a wooded area in northern France following reports of sightings of the two suspects – brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi - of the Charlie Hebdo massacre.
