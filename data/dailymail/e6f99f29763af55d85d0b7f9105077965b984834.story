John Arne Riise has taken to Instagram to show his frustration at having to miss Apoel Nicosia's Champions League clash against PSG through injury.

The former Liverpool defender posted a picture of his right foot hooked up to the latest technology - four suction pads which will have been helping the movement and bloodflow in the injured area, as Riise looks to recover in time for Apoel's Cypriot First Division clash against Doxa Katokopias on Monday.

Riise posted the message: 'Very frustrating missing the big game against PSG tomorrow. Knock and little twist of ankle last game. Good news is that I'm ready for the game on Sunday'.

Apoel's chances of qualifying for this season's group stages look unlikely after collecting just one point from their opening three Group F games.

Things won't be getting any easier for Giorgos Donis's side with matches against PSG, Barcelona and Ajax all still to play.

However, Apoel do travel to Paris after a convincing 4-0 away win at Ethnikos extended their unbeaten run to eight league games.

Meanwhile, Apoel's opponents on Wednesday looked to be in high spirits as they trained in Paris.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss the match because a left heel injury that is taking longer to heal than expected, PSG coach Laurent Blanc hopes the Swedish international could be back for the match against bitter rivals Marseille on Sunday.

'He is feeling much better, but he is not yet able to train with the rest,' Blanc said. 'He's not in pain anymore and that's a good sign.'

Ibrahimovic's injury has had less impact than expected as the Parisian club remains unbeaten this season in all competitions.
