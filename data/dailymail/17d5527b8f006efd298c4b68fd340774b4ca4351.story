A grandmother has found a way to avoid shelling out for expensive skin creams - by letting live snails slide all over her face.

Edith Pangle, 62, said she has maintained her youthful looks by allowing the slimy molluscs to slither across her skin for at least 15 minutes every week.

The grandmother came up with the idea after seeing adverts for luxury facial creams featuring the garden creature's ooze.

Enough to make your skin crawl: South African Edith Pangle keeps the snails in a bag in her bedroom

But rather than splashing out on products, thrifty Ms Pangle simply collects snails from her back garden and lets them work their way across her skin.

These amazing pictures show her enjoying the unique beauty therapy treatment at her home in Cape Town, South Africa.

Ms Pangle told South Africa’s Daily Voice newspaper she believed the bizarre ritual had helped her keep her looks.

She said: 'I just let the snails crawl over my face, my neck and my hands.

'Once a woman reaches a certain age you need to look after your skin, and this costs me nothing.'

Ms
Pangle told the Daily Voice she started using snails as part of her 
beauty therapy two years ago after spotting a television advert for an 
anti-acne cream imported from France.

Ms Pangle says her garden snails can last up to weeks once caught and kept in bags

She now regularly goes hunting in her
own garden and those of friends and neighbours for the slimey 
creatures, which she keeps in a bag in her bedroom.

Ms Pangle lets the snails out at least once a week to slide across her face, neck and hands.

She sits back and stays still as the creatures leave a trail of mucus on her skin.

She then just needs a quick wash with cold water before her beauty routine is complete.

The grandmother said the home-made therapy was just as good as expensive creams.

She
said: 'I can’t afford the expensive cream made from snails in France. 
That’s when I started collecting the snails and using them.'

She added: 'I have my snails right here, I keep them for weeks in this packet and I don’t even need to feed them.'

MS
Pangle said many of her friends had been stunned when they found out 
about her bizarre beauty routine. But she said some had started using 
snail therapy themselves after seeing the results.

She added: 'I told a friend in England to try it out and she called me a few weeks later to say it does work.'

However
Ms Pangle’s idea has not gone down well with all members of her family.
Her brother Ken told the Daily Voice he hated seeing snails sliding 
over his sister.

He said: 'I can’t watch when she does this - it’s too creepy.'

Snail extract has become a key ingredient in expensive skin creams

Snail slime has recently been heralded by cosmetic firms as a useful beauty ingredient. Several upmarket facial creams now include the shelled slug’s mucus.

Those who apply the cream are told the slime can help reduce wrinkles, clear up acne and reduce pigmentation and scarring. But commercial creams can prove costly for those wanting to try the healing power of the snail.

A 130 ml tube of cream containing snail slime was being sold by Missha for $33.99. Meanwhile a 30ml jar of cream made from 85 percent snail slime was on offer from the beauty firm Labcconte for $64.99.
