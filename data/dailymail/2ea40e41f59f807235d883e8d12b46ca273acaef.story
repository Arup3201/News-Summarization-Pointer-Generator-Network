Members of Parliament, peers and their staff accessed pornographic websites 300,000 times over the past year, official records reveal.

The total – which represents more than 820 sites a day – was released by Palace of Westminster IT bosses yesterday in response to a freedom of  information request.

The figure covers ‘attempts to access websites categorised as pornography’. However parliamentary staff said it included pop-ups and was therefore not a reflection of deliberate efforts to find sexual content.

Logging on: Between May 2012 and July 2013 there were almost 300,000 attempts to access pornographic websites in Parliament (file picture)

All the devices monitored were linked 
to the parliamentary network, which is used by MPs, peers and their 
staff, between the  summers of 2012 and 2013.

There
 were wide variations in the monthly figures – with a staggering 114,844
 attempts to look at porn made in November, but just 15 in February.

Matthew
 Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This 
highlights the fact that many people working in Parliament are spending 
far too much time on websites that have nothing to do with their job.

‘The
 internet can be a useful tool for MPs and their staff when it comes to 
scrutinising government legislation. However taxpayers expect their MP 
and those working in their offices to get on with their important jobs 
rather than spending time surfing questionable websites.’

A
 House of Commons spokesman insisted the records did not prove users 
‘intended’ to access pornography, and said the House of Commons would 
not put in rules that could restrict attempts to ‘carry out research’.

She
 added: ‘We do not consider the data to provide an accurate 
representation of the number of purposeful requests made by network 
users due to the ways in which websites can be designed to act, react 
and interact and due to the potential operation of third-party 
software.’

Earlier this 
year it was revealed MPs and their staff waste thousands of hours a year
 tinkering with their Facebook pages, playing computer games and placing
 online bets. Official records show computers on the parliamentary 
estate log on to Facebook up to 3million times a month – 300 times as 
often as they access the BBC News website.

The
 figures also revealed a high number of visits to supermarket shopping 
websites, computer gaming sites and music download sites such as 
Grooveshark, which is being sued for alleged copyright offences.

In
 March last year, for example, there were more than 83,000 visits to 
Betfair’s online horseracing form guide, along with 5,461 to a betting 
site for other sports that is operated by the same online bookmaker.

There were 4,665 visits to bookmaker Paddy Power, 3,803 to rival Ladbrokes and 4,126 to horseracing news site attheraces.com.

Several MPs also appeared to make thousands of visits to their own websites each month.

And
 up to 50,000 visits were made to the controversial  adultery website 
Out of Town Affairs, which matches up  people looking for 
‘no-strings-attached fun, hot steamy action and erotic encounters’.

The site has since been blocked on computers using the parliamentary system.
