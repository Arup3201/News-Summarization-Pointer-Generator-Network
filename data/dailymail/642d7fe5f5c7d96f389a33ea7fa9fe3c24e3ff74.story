A hero tree surgeon has spoken of how he saved a man from being savagely beaten after confronting the thug while dressed as a caveman.

Courageous Karl Stephenson, 30, leapt into action wearing his caveman outfit after he saw a helpless victim being battered outside a pub in Stourbridge, West Midlands.

CCTV footage which captured the moment made headlines around the world last week after police released it in a bid to trace the attacker.

Courageous caveman: Karl Stephenson came to the aid of a man who was being savagely beaten on a night out, while wearing this fancy dress costume

And now fearless Karl, who managed to scare the thug away before staying with the 31-year-old injured man until an ambulance arrived, has spoken of the ordeal.

Just moments before the attack, the victim was pushed to the ground before the thug rained blows on his face and continued to kick him in the head.

Armed with just his inflatable club, Karl, in his Halloween costume, stormed over in disgust as the yob kicked and punched the man unconscious.

But modest Karl, of Hagley, West Midlands, today said he was just trying to be a good citizen.

He said: 'For some reason my friends went out the front door and I went out the back. That's when I saw the man being kicked.

'There were three men attacking him. I wanted them to stop so I went over and asked them what they were doing.

Vicious: The CCTV footage shows the thug attacking the victim even though he is clearly helpless

'One of my friends called the police and ambulance to help the injured man.

'It was really horrible. It was one of those moments where I was thinking "was that real?" I couldn't believe it had happened.'

Karl said the man had been badly injured, but he was glad he was recovering well.

Rescued: The attacker stops after Karl, dressed as a caveman, and his acquaintance arrive to pull him off his victim

He said: 'I was just trying to be a good citizen and I hope somebody would so the same for me.

'The first thing I knew about the footage being released was when my sister text me to say she had heard it on the radio.

'I couldn't believe it when I saw the video - it was everywhere. Out of all the things I could be wearing it was a dead caveman costume.

'We had decided to wear fancy dress because it was almost Halloween.'

Helping hand: Karl is seen to drop his club as he comes to the aid of the beaten victim

Detective Constable John Horrobin, from West Midlands Police, appealed for any witnesses to the incident on October 27 to come forward

He said: 'In the footage you will see a couple of people in fancy dress costume.

'There had been a fancy dress party at the Mitre Inn on that night and we are appealing to anyone that may have seen the victim on the night to come forward.

'If you saw the assault we would also like to speak to you - ultimately we are hoping that someone will recognise the attacker and will come forward with a name.

'The victim has little recollection of the attack and thankfully he will make a full recovery.'
