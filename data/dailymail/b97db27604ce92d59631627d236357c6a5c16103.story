History textbooks inspired by the Horrible Histories franchise are making a mockery of the past, a leading teacher has claimed. 

Robert Peal, a history teacher and research fellow for the think tank Civitas, said giving pupils books which make light of subjects encouraged them not to think about the past but to laugh at it.

Mr Peal cited Horrible Histories, a multi-million pound text and audio book franchise, as being responsible for the decline in standards.

Robert Peal said the Horrible Histories books encouraged pupils not to think about the past but to laugh at it

Slamming chapters titled 'Was Henry VII a gangster?' and 'There's something about Mary' which detail Henry VII and Mary Tudor respectively, Mr Peal said: 'You would be hard pushed to find a stretch of more than 200 words that is not broken by a cartoon or a snippet of "source material".'

Speaking generally about textbooks given to secondary school history pupils, he said: 'The layout often resembles a magazine, not a book, with short chunks of boxed text designed to cater to the supposedly minimal attention spans of today's pupils. 

'The aesthetic owes much to the Horrible Histories series, with children encouraged not to think about the past but to laugh at it.' 

Mr Peal made his comments in an article for the Times Educational Supplement. Earlier this year, in a piece for the Mail, Mr Peal described his experiences as a history teacher at an inner-city school. 

Among problems at hand, he said, was an abundance of bad behaviour and seeming lack of ideas on how to improve upon this.

He welcomed the then Education Secretary Michael Gove's 'culture war' against children-centred teaching methods, claiming old fashioned books and disciplinary tactics were more effective.  

Horrible Histories began in 1993 with a series of books by author Terry Deary. Among the texts, called Gory Stories, are accounts of the Egyptians and the Roman era. 

CBBC created a children's television programme of the series while many of the books, including Vile Victorians and Frightful First World War have been adapted into plays. 

In 2014 the author behind the series, Terry Deary, said in an interview that all of his research is second hand. 

'I don't go to primary sources and I don't go digging fields for coins. 

'I read other people's big, fat history books for the good stuff, so my readers don't have to,' the writer told the Independent. 

He added while he had been a teacher, he was not a historian and did not purport to be one. 

'I'm not a historian. I am a children's author, and I had 50 fiction books published long before the Horrible Histories series came along.'

The series has been adapted into plays and television programmes. Above, actors in an episode depicting the First World War
