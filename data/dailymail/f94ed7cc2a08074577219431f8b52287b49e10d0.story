Bono has apologised for sending his band's album to the libraries of iTunes users throughout the world.

The U2 frontman described the move by Apple as a 'drop of megalomania, a touch of generosity'.

When someone suggested to him that it was 'rude' to impose his music on everyone, Bono said: 'Oops, I'm sorry about that.'

Bono has apologised for sending his band's album to the libraries of iTunes users throughout the world. The U2 frontman described the move by Apple as a 'drop of megalomania, a touch of generosity'. Here he is pictured with his band members and Apple CEO, Tim Cook (left), at the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch event in September

Apple announced at its iPhone 6 launch event that the Irish band's latest album would be automatically added to every iTunes Store account, in 119 countries around the world, for free.

Since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch, Apple has released a one-click tool allowing iTunes customers to remove the album if they wish.

An Apple user on a recent Q&A Facebook session said: 'Can you please never release an album on iTunes that automatically downloads to people's playlists ever again? It's really rude.'

'I had this beautiful idea and we got carried away with ourselves. Artists are prone to that kind of thing,' Bono replied.

Unfortunately for Apple and U2, many of other customers are not happy the 'Songs of Innocence' album had been forced upon them – and took to Twitter and Facebook to voice their upset

Go to Apple's removal page, click Remove Album and enter your Apple ID.

The album will be automatically removed from your account.

The album was distributed to iTunes users via iCloud, which means it appears in the Music app on devices, but isn’t physically stored on the computer, phone or tablet until it has been downloaded.

If it has been downloaded, users can swipe to the left on each song and click Delete, but unless they use the recently created page, the album will still sit in the account.

To hide the album from iTunes manually, users must log into their account, find the album and click the cross in the top left-hand corner of the cover image.

The album may also appear if the phone has the auto-download feature enabled. To turn this off, go to Settings, iTunes & App Store, then disable Automatic Downloads.

Unless users remove the album, using Apple's latest link, the songs will still be played in Shuffle mode.

A manual fix for this is to create a custom playlist on an iOS device and exclude U2’s Songs of Innocence from it.

'A drop of megalomania, a touch of generosity, a dash of self-promotion and deep fear that these songs that we poured our life into over the last few years mightn't be heard.

'There's a lot of noise out there. I guess we got a little noisy ourselves to get through it,' he said.

Unfortunately for Apple and U2, many of other customers are not happy the 'Songs of Innocence' album had been forced upon them – and took to Twitter and Facebook to voice their upset.

Twitter user @HayleyMuir said: '#Apple outrage; notified earlier I've no storage for pics, to discover I've attained a U2 album I DON'T WANT & can't delete #p*****d OFF!!!!'

While @HTFCMac tweeted: 'If iTunes even thinks of putting U2 on my computer I may go into full on #OUTRAGE', which was seconded by @Roxiestargazer, who said: 'All these U2 songs appearing on my phone? This is an outrage.'

A number of users also referenced the wider security implications.

‏User @MezMerrett tweeted: 'If Apple can forcefully download a U2 album onto everyone's phone, imagine what else they can do and see.'

At the time, Bono noted that not everyone would be happy to receive the free music.

'For the people out there who have no interest in checking us out, look at it this way… the blood, sweat and tears of some Irish guys are in your junk mail,' he wrote on the band's website.

Bono's apology follows rock star Iggy Pop's criticism that the band is 'giving away music before it can flop, in an effort to stay huge.'
