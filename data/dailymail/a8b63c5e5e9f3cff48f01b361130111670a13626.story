Jordan Silverstone has been criticised for selling a tuxedo David Beckham donated to a charity shop for £2,600

Posing in the tuxedo he bought from a charity shop for just £125 after it was donated by David Beckham, this is the economics student who has been criticised for cashing in after he sold the item online for £2,600.

Jordan Silverstone bought the Savile Row tuxedo from a British Red Cross charity shop in Chelsea after the Beckhams donated more than 20 boxes of clothes, bags and shoes in an attempt to raise money for victims of Typhoon Haiyan.

Hundreds of fans queued around the block in a bid to get their hands on rare designer items, but a number of shoppers then put the items up for sale online.

Mr Silverstone had queued for one and a half hours before buying the suit which Beckham wore to the Sun’s Military Awards in 2011, where he was pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge.

The 22-year-old has said he originally bought the William Hunt tuxedo for his father Matthew's 53rd birthday, but when he got it home he realised his father would not fit into it.

The Nottingham University student then decided to sell the suit and keep three quarters of the profit, to pay for a day out with his father and to put towards paying off his student loan, with the rest going to charity.

But the Nottingham University student has suffered abuse through social media sites and on eBay accusing him of cashing in on a charitable gesture.

Nazaneen Ghaffer, a Sky News weather presenter, said on Twitter that if an item doesn’t fit, people should ‘just sell them for what he/she paid’ – not make a profit.

But Mr Silverstone responded, saying: ‘It is absolute nonsense. If I keep the suit and leave it in my Dad’s wardrobe never to be worn then that is okay, but if I sell it on to a buyer who really wants it that isn’t?'

He added: ‘Where is the logic behind that? It’s rich of anyone to knock someone else’s charitable donations. Nazaneen Ghaffer poses pictures of her exotic holidays in Dubai on Twitter – is someone having a go at her for not giving this money to starving children? No.’

He said: ‘From an economics point of view, it makes complete sense.

‘It doesn’t fit my dad, so we want to sell it to someone who can get value out of it as that’s better than it being unused.

‘This way I can raise more money for 
charity than I already have by buying the tux and make a profit to do 
something nice with my dad.’

Only 150 shoppers were allowed in to the charity shop on November 22, before it changed to one-in-one out, after more than 500 donated items went on sale, incuding designs by Dolce & Gabbana, Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo, which started at just £25.

But Mr Silverstone is not the only one who has put up one of the items for sale to make a profit.

Other items that have been auctioned online include Victoria's white platform trainers she wore at the Dodgers Mets game on June 7, 2007, with bids starting at £1,000 despite the owner paying less than £50 for them.

Another eBay user is selling a pair of Victoria’s Gianni Versace black heels for £330.

Student Jordan Silverstone was only one of many of the charity shoppers who put the donated items up for sale online.

Just hours after the Red Cross shop selling the Beckhams' donations opened, items from the sale were listed on eBay.

Many are still on the site, including a pair of Victoria's Dolce & Gabbana stilettos, with a starting price of £300, and a Gucci coat which had belonged to David, which has attracted a bid of £530.

The sellers of each of the items found by MailOnline on the auction website today had included a note within the item description saying part of the sale would be donated to the British Red Cross.

Among those listed on the site are a pair of white wedge trainers worn by Victoria at the Dodgers Mets game on June 7, 2007, with bids starting at £1,000.

Elsewhere a pair of Victoria's Free Lance leather boots were being sold for £139 while a Roberto Cavalli tuxedo, worn by David, had a starting bid of £800.

A pair of David's Yves Saint Laurent trousers meanwhile were being sold for £49.99.
