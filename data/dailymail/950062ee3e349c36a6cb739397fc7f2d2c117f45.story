A father has ordered his family to spend a year living like it was 1986 by banning all modern technology after fearing gadgets were spoiling his children.

Blair McMillan made the call to carry out his 'social experiment' after his son Trey, five, said he preferred to stay indoors and play games on an iPad rather than go outside on a hot summer day.

So Blair, remembering when he was a child and how it was impossible to keep children sitting quietly indoors, decided to go back in time and give his kids a taste of life in the year he was born.

Playtime: Blair McMillan is converting sons Denton, left, and Trey, right, to the simple joys of old fashioned fun after banning modern technology

Since April, the McMillans, from Guelph in Ontario, Canada, have given up all modern technology with Blair even growing a mullet.

The family have no internet or 24-hour news channels. Instead they have an old 1980's TV set encased in a wooden cabinet and a 'ghetto blaster' cassette player blaring 80's classics.

They have thrown out their mobile phones, post real letters instead of sending emails, and knock on people's front doors instead of following them on Facebook.

When travelling they use a map to 
navigate instead of using a GPS navigation system and use film-based 
cameras to capture special moments.

Most
of their friends have been supportive of their experiment but Blair, 
26, revealed some simply can't give up technology even when visiting the
1986 household.

Stepping back in time: Blair McMillan has brought his family back to 1986 after shunning all modern technology - including Sat Navs

Blast from the past: Blair McMillan has been getting used to using an outdated 'ghetto blaster' and living without 24-hour news channels, Facebook and emails as he sees if life was better without modern technology

He said: 'It feels weird - it feels 
like we have really gone back in time. The strangest thing without 
having a cell phone is that I could almost feel my pocket vibrating and 
wanted to check my pocket.

'At the same time the experience has brought the family closer and given us an opportunity to talk to each other a lot more.

'I'd like to think I've been touching a lot of lives just through the people that I've met when they see me and the way I look.

'They will stop to take pictures of me and talk to me - they think what we're doing is really cool.

'Some
won't catch on though. I even have a 'cell phone box' inside the front 
door of our house and whoever wants to enter has to leave it there for 
the duration of their visit.'

In fashion: Blair McMillan's social experiment to take his family back to 1986 even extends to adopting a mullet which was fashionable at the time
