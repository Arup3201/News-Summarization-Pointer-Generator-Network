Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers remains keen to add to his squad before the summer transfer window closes at the end of the month.

Rodgers has already made a number of signings but is still thought to want another forward following the £75million sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

The Reds were close to landing France striker Loic Remy from QPR last month but a deal collapsed after a medical.

Veteran former Barcelona and Inter Milan frontman Samuel Eto'o, who is out of contract after leaving Chelsea at the end of last season, is the latest name to have been linked with Anfield.

Rodgers told the club's website, www.liverpoolfc.com: 'We would still like to do some business.

'Across the board we still want to add a little bit more depth to what we have.'

Liverpool have already signed international strikers Rickie Lambert and Divock Origi this summer, although the latter is to be loaned back to former club Lille.

Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Lazar Markovic have been brought in to bolster midfield options while defenders Dejan Lovren and Javier Manquillo have also been added to the squad.

Liverpool completed their pre-season programme with a 4-0 win over Borussia Dortmund at Anfield on Sunday.

They open their Barclays Premier League campaign at home to Southampton - the club from which they signed Lambert, Lallana and Lovren - on Sunday.
