The days of just a spirit and mixer on board a flight could soon be over.

New carry on cocktail-making are kits giving passengers the chance to flex their mixology skills while at 30,000 feet.

One simple take-on tin contains a mini bottle of aromatic bitters, cane sugar, spoon-come- muddle and a linen coaster, allowing passengers to mix the perfect Old Fashioned, a whiskey based snifter made famous by Mad Men's Don Draper. 

The Travel Cocktail Kit comes with nine empty bottles, a mixing spoon, and a detailed book containing instructions, as well as 15 different cocktail recipes

The kit is the brain child of Brooklyn-based cocktail website Punch and the product designers at W&P Design. 

For something more swish, designer Stephen Kenn has created a plush leather pouch that comes with everything passengers need to blend a selection of quality tipples.

The Travel Cocktail Kit which will set you back $275.00 - around £175 - comes with nine empty bottles, a mixing spoon, and a detailed book containing instructions on how to pack the kit for different types of trips, as well as 15 different cocktail recipes.

Quick mix: The carry on cocktail kit allows passengers to create their own Old Fashioned cocktail on board

Passengers are advised to pack the kit using supplies from your home bar according to the individual instructions for your trip type, then use it the kit to make different cocktails on board.

Fliers are required to by their booze from the flight attendant, but bringing a couple of extra ingredients in your hand luggage could be the difference between an average tomato juice and a rocking Bloody Mary.

Old fashioned: Which cocktail will you create?

You don't need to put up with boring drinks in flight.

By packing a few key ingredients in your hand luggage, you can mix any of these classic cocktails:

Bloody Mary: Bring a packet of pepper, a mini bottle of hot sauce (and some celery if you want to push the boat out). Order a vodka and tomato juice with ice. 

Old Fashioned: Bring a mini bottle of non-alcoholic bitters, a sugar packet, and an orange . Order a whiskey with ice, and ask for a knife to slice the fruit.

Juan Collins: Try this classic cocktail with a Mexican twist. Bring a lemon and a lime and a packet of sugar. Order a Tequila and a club soda. 

Squeeze lemon into a cup of ice, sprinkle with half a pack of sugar, and mix in the tequila. Garnish with a lime.

Negroni: Bring an orange slice. Order a Campari, a gin, a cup of ice, and a cranberry, grapefruit, or orange juice.
