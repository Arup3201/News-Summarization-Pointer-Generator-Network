Mohammed Emwazi has apologised to his parents for bringing shame to the family after being unmasked as ISIS butcher 'Jihadi John'.

But the 26-year-old executioner, who has murdered a number of western hostages, including two British aid workers, has not expressed any remorse for the barbaric killings. 

Emwazi's family have been forced into hiding since his identity was revealed.

Killer: Mohammed Emwazi, left in the most recent photograph known to have been taken of him before he entered Syria to join ISIS militants. He has apologised to his parents for bringing shame to his family after being unmasked as ISIS butcher 'Jihadi John'

The 26-year-old executioner, who has murdered a number of western hostages, including two British aid workers, has not expressed any remorse for the barbaric killings 

They were advised to leave their £600,000 council house for their own safety, and now his mother is living at a secret location under police protection along with four out of his five brothers and sisters.

Meawhile, his father and eldest sister are in Kuwait.

The Sunday Times reports that Emwazi had sent an apology via a third party for the 'problems and trouble the revelation of his identity has caused'. 

In the Islamic faith it is believed that those who disobey or disrespect their parents are more likely to go to hell.

Kuwaiti MPs have told Emwazi's father, Jasem, to publicly distance himself from his son's actions by apologising – or leave the country.

Kuwaitis have become increasingly frustrated with the mixed messages coming from 51-year-old British citizen Mr Emwazi, whose family are said to have cost the British tax-payer up to £400,000 in the 20 years they have lived in the UK.

Last week, Mr Emwazi told former workmates his son was a 'dog' and hoped he would die. 

Just a few days later,  lawyers acting for Mr Emwazi in Kuwait suggested there was 'no proof' that the masked executioner-in-chief was in fact Mohammed.

Mr Emwazi is believed to have been living in Kuwait with his eldest daughter Asma, 25, for the last two years. 

His wife Ghaneya and four other children remained in London – and are now guarded by armed police in a hotel at a reported cost of £5,000 a day.

It has also been reported that Westminster council is still paying the rent on the family's £600,000 flat -  even though the rules say housing benefit should normally be stopped after 13 weeks.

As members of the stateless Bedoon ethnic group, the Emwazis were granted asylum in the UK, claiming to have fled Kuwait in fear of persecution.
