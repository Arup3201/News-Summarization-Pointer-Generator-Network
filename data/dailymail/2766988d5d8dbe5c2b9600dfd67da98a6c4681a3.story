For more than a century it has shown its readers exotic locations and revealed exciting cultures.

But National Geographic is under attack from archaeologists for a forthcoming series on its television channel about excavating war graves on the Eastern Front from the Second World War.

Called ‘Nazi War Diggers’, the programme is due to be screened in the UK on May 13, and is billed as ‘three war diggers racing against time to save this history from being looted or lost’.

Controversial: One of the diggers retrieves a bone from  a grave in Latvia's Courland Peninsula

A gruesome preview video appears on the channel’s website, which shows the presenters extracting various body parts from a muddy grave in Latvia. At one point, the men mistake a leg bone for an arm bone after wrenching it from the ground.

According to Dr Tony Pollard, the Director of the Centre for Battlefield Archaeology at Glasgow University, the show is a ‘disgrace’.

‘I’m appalled that a major broadcaster has sunk to the levels of exploitation television,’ he said. ‘I’ve been at the forefront of battlefield archaeology for fifteen years, and I have spent much time getting the subject taken seriously.

'This just looks like they’ve gone around digging up bodies, because TV likes a dead body.’

Dr Pollard regards the way in which the programme’s presenters handle human remains as being particularly insensitive.

‘This shows no evidence of even the most basic archaeological principles - this is treasure hunting not archaeology. 

'I have seen human remains brandished like trophies before but in dodgy youtube videos. The fact that this comes from a commissioned TV series is quite beyond belief.

‘The trailer on the internet was absolutely shocking, and very damaging for National Geographic.’

The programme has been commissioned by the satellite channel from the same company that made Sex Box - the controversial feature aired on Channel 4 in October where couples had sex in a sound-proofed box before being interviewed about the experience in front of an audience.

Dozens of archaeologists have left comments on the National Geographic website, lambasting the channel for what they see as a grotesquely insensitive intrusion into a gravesite.

‘You are sensationalizing and promoting the looting of archaeological sites and the disrespect of human remains,’ wrote Shannon Boomgarden of the Natural History Museum of Utah. ‘You should be ashamed to profit off these destructive activities disguised as “science”.’

Dr Sam Hardy of University College, London, who specialises in research into the illegal antiquities trade, is incensed at what he has seen.

‘Based on the preview video, the Nazi War Diggers didn’t record their finds properly,’ he said. ‘They didn’t take out the material carefully. To me, it looks untrained and unsupervised. If I tried to excavate a skeleton like that on a dig I would have been stopped and thrown off the site. It’s slapdash and it destroys evidence.’

Background: The programme claims the 'war diggers' are 'racing against time to save this history from being looted or lost'

‘If this is representative of their work, then they’ve probably violated European conventions concerning the protection of archaeological heritage.’

Dr Pollard is also concerned that Nazi War Diggers will condone a disturbing trade in Nazi relics. ‘The net result of this is that more and more of these human remains will be unnecessarily disturbed,” he says, “by those looking for items to sell.’

One of the programme’s presenters, Craig Gottlieb, is a dealer in Nazi memorabilia, and who is quoted on the National Geographic site as saying: ‘I feel that by selling things that are Nazi related and for lots of money, I’m preserving a part of history that museums don’t want to bother with.’

Such comments have only inflamed the archaeological community, who believe that Nazi War Diggers is little more than looting.

Yesterday, National Geographic appeared to back down over the programme, and removed the video and the archaeologists’ comments from their website. They also removed the quote from Mr Gottlieb.

A spokesman for National Geographic said: ‘Unfortunately, a video excerpt from our show posted on our website did not provide important context about our team’s methodology. This series operates in direct conjunction with organizations officially licensed to excavate battlefield sites and adhered to their procedures.’
