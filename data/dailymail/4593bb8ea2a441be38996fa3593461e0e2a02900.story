New footage has emerged of a Chinese toddler smoking a cigarette in the street as he is laughed at by onlookers.

The pictures are believed to be of a child aged between two and three and despite the vast numbers of adults around, not one attempts to take the cigarette away from him.

Passers-by and people on bikes passing can be heard laughing as the little boy holds the cigarette, taking several puffs of it like an 'old pro'.

The footage was obtained by liveleak.com and has sparked fresh debate about the scale of China's tobacco habit.

It is thought that around 30 per cent of the population of China smokes, which equates to 300 million people, with as many as 53 per cent of adult men in the country smoking.

However, at the end of last year, smoking in public places such as schools and hospitals was banned in the country.

It comes after another Chinese two-year-old, Tong Liangliang was pictured lighting up after being taught by his father, who believed the habit would alleviate pain caused by a hernia.

The child, who is thought to be between two and three years of age, was captured on camera smoking the cigarette
