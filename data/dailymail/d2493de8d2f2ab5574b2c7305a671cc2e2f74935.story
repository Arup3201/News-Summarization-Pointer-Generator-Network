Clive and Jane Green have just arrived home after a long summer holiday. So long, in fact, it began back in July 1998.

What started as a brief sailing trip to Ireland and Spain, turned into a 16-year round-the-world adventure.

The retired couple had planned a short voyage to try out their 35ft sailing boat the Jane Green before venturing any further.

Ahoy! Married couple Clive and Jane Green took off for a week-long sailing trip and just returned 16 years later

The trip began because the married couple wanted to see if they could live together in a cramped 35ft boat 

But after arriving in Spain, they decided to keep going, stopping in 51 countries along the way.

They have finally returned to the marina in Pembrokeshire, West Wales, from where they set sail in 1998.

From Spain, the couple sailed to the Cape Verde islands and across the Atlantic to Barbados before island-hopping through the Caribbean. They then sailed up the eastern coast of the US, calling into New York.

So far, so good! Following a successful first week journey to Spain, Jane (60) and Clive (62) opted to continue 

Wedded bliss: In over 16 years of circumnavigating the globe, Clive insists the pair never fought once 

After heading north to Canada they journeyed back down to the Panama Canal, crossed the Pacific to Australasia, sailed up through South-East Asia, over to India and through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean where they have been sailing for the last two years.

They lived on around £130 a week, bartering belongings for supplies.

Their best swap was one of Mrs Green’s M&S bras for a sack full of fresh fruit and vegetables on a small island off Fiji.

Never ones to shy away from adventure, Jane and Clive spent 18 months exploring New Zealand

She recalled: ‘The tribe didn’t speak any English so it was difficult to find out what we could trade.

'But one of the women suddenly lifted up her jumper to expose her breasts and I realised she needed a bra.

'I gave her a spare and we left with enough fruit and veg for a month.’ 

Simply breathtaking: The pair spent time in Fatu Hiva, French Polynesia during their 16-year voyage

Cheers! To survive at sea, Clive chose to stock the small boat fridge with just one item: his favourite beer

The couple say they didn’t have a single argument on board their £16,500 vessel.

Mr Green, 62, explained: ‘We made a rule that if ever we fell out one of us had to leave the cabin and sit on the deck next to the mast. But in 16 years it didn’t happen once.’

They had encounters with turtles and sting rays, saw orang-utans in Borneo, Komodo Dragon lizards in Indonesia and swam with seals.

Mrs Green, 60, said after they arrived back in Wales last week: ‘We have been very lucky to see our planet in such an amazing way.

'We didn’t ever plan to sail around the world.

'We would sail to a place and then, through word-of-mouth from other sailors hear about somewhere else to go on to. That has been our life for the last 16 years.’ 

1998-1999: After leaving Wales on July 11, they took in Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Madeira, Canaries, Cape Verde and Barbados

Jane and Clive took early retirement to live their dream.  Here, they hold a coconut crab in the Cook Islands

The Greens, who don’t have children, took early retirement to live their dream – he worked as a utility company engineer and she was a hospital microbiology technician – and rented their home out in Abergavenny, South Wales. 

Apart from Mr Green having a tooth abscess and slicing off the tip of his finger on the galley table, they survived without a scrape.

Their biggest scare was being followed by a boat in waters inhabited by Somali pirates.  

'Jane is as capable as me,' Clive says of his wife's sailing abilities. 'There's nothing on the boat she can't do'

G'day mate: Jane and Clive visited over 50 countries, but opted to spend two years in Australia

But it turned out to be an Eritrean fishing boat with a crewman who had a severe gash to his leg which Mrs Green was able to dress.

The Greens arrived back in Neyland Marina, near Milford Haven,16 years, one month and two days after they left. 

Mr Green said: ‘It is good to see all our family and friends and we have promised ourselves to spend a few months getting to know them all again.’ 

The pair are also planning their next trip – boating the canals of Europe.

In order to fully experience New Zealand, the couple purchased a van for £180 and toured the entire island

Clive especially liked exploring the coastal villages, often playing football with the local children

While not bothered by rough water, the couple admits that their most frightening moment occurred when they believed they were being followed in water inhabited by Somali pirates

Welcoming committee: The couple's good friends - who saw them off 16 years ago - were on hand to greet Jane and Clive upon their return
