This is the terrifying moment thugs launched a firework into an off licence, which exploded and filled the shop with smoke.

CCTV footage shows a gang of about six masked men carrying a bag full of rockets before firing one into the shop.

It shot underneath a freezer before exploding.

CCTV footage (pictured from four different angles inside the shop) shows the moment the firework exploded and filled Doug and Di's Off Licence with smoke

The rocket can be seen exploding under a freezer unit (top left) while owner Doug Gill was in a back room. He said it was a 'miracle' no one was hurt as the shop happened to be empty at the time

The gang - dressed in hoods with scarves over their faces - were filmed throwing the rocket inside the shop 

CCTV footage shows one of the gang opening the door of the off licence before another throws the rocket inside.

The gang are dressed with their hoods up and their faces covered by scarves.

Shop owner Doug Gill said it was 'a miracle' no one was hurt.

He has contacted police and released CCTV footage of the incident at his shop in Heaviley, Stockport, to try and track the culprits.

The 61-year-old, who has run Doug and Di's Off Licence, for 28 years, said: 'It was reckless beyond belief.

'They didn’t check who was in there before they threw it inside and it was a miracle it didn’t hurt someone or cause some serious damage.

Mr Gill said it is a 'miracle' no one was hurt in the incident, which he said was 'reckless beyond belief'

'What worries me is that my family, 
including my three-year-old granddaughter, will often be out in the shop
and if they’d have been in its path they could have been badly burned.

'I was in the back at the time and I just heard a deafening bang. When I got downstairs the shop had filled with smoke.'

Mr Gill chased the group along the road after they threw the rocket but they ran inside a house.

Ahead of tomorrow’s Bonfire Night celebrations, police chiefs have urged anyone worried about anti-social behaviour involving fireworks to report it.

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan of Greater Manchester Police said: 'If behaviour gets out of hand and causes distress to anyone then we will take firm action.'

The rocket attack on the shop happened at about 1.40pm on Saturday.
