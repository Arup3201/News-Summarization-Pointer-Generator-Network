Luka Modric is facing an extended spell on the sidelines after the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) announced the midfielder would be out of action for three months with a thigh injury.

The 29-year-old sustained the problem midway through the first half of Croatia's Euro 2016 qualifier against Italy.

The news will come as a blow to Real Madrid, who revealed the former Tottenham and Dinamo Zagreb man had suffered a 'tear of the left proximal rectus femoris tendon' on Monday, although they did not put a timescale on his recovery.

But the HNS has confirmed he is likely to be out of action until well after the new year.

'The Croatian national team and Real Madrid midfielder will be away from the football pitch for about three months after the injury sustained in the encounter between Italy and Croatia,' said a statement on the HNS website.

'Modric, in the 28th minute of the match at the San Siro, had to ask for a substitution after experiencing pain in the muscle, and MRI scans in Madrid showed that it was a serious injury.'

The midfielder will not to be back in action by the time Real travel to Morocco for the Club World Cup in December.

The Champions League holders will face either Cruz Azul or Western Sydney Wanderers in a semi-final on December 16 ahead of a potential final four days later.
