This is the dramatic aftermath of a crash involving a £180,000 Ferrari that lost two of its wheels after colliding with four parked cars and a house.

The red Ferrari 458 Italia came to a stop on the pavement following the collision in Winchmore Hill, north London.

The 202mph car, which is capable of 0-60mph in 3.3 seconds, left the road and hit a parked car before colliding with a pillar outside a mock Tudor home.

It then knocked into two more parked cars before coming to rest, without its passenger-side wheels, against a fourth.

According to witnesses, neither the driver nor any pedestrians were injured in the incident.

Witness Laura Sorrell, 51, said: 'The young man, I would say he was in his 20s, clambered out through the window and just stood there looking at the damage.

'He was fine though - I can't believe that nobody was hurt.

Production of the Ferrari 458 began in 2009. It has rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive

There are two different body types: Berlinetta and Spider

Engine: 4.5L V8 (562 hp at 9,000rpm)

Transmission: 7-speed dual-clutch

Acceleration: 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.3 seconds

Top speed: 325 km/h (202 mph)

'It was such a nice day, there’s no telling how many people could have been just standing around on the street.

'Once we realised nobody was hurt, everyone was stood around in shock.'

Police and paramedics attended the scene last Friday afternoon, but nobody was injured and the driver was not found to have committed any offences.

Ms Sorrell, who runs Sorrells Naturally beauty company, said: 'The driver was so shocked. He just stood there in disbelief.

'I hope the car wasn’t his dad’s, otherwise he’d be in big trouble.'
