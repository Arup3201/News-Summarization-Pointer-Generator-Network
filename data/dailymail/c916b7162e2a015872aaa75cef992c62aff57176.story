As condemned Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran wait on 'death island' for their latest appeal to go to court, it's been revealed that almost 200 Indonesians on death row around the world have had their sentences commuted over the last three years - at the request of the Indonesian government.

189 Indonesian death sentences were suspended thanks to diplomatic efforts - and in some cases, money paid - by Indonesia,The Sunday Telegraph reports. The Indonesians who won reprieves were convicted of crimes which included drug smuggling in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, China, Iran and Singapore.

'I am not requesting of Indonesia anything that Indonesia does not request of other nations where Indonesian citizens face the death penalty,' Ms Bishop told the Telegraph. 

'We urge the Indonesian government to show the same mercy to Andrew and Myuran as it seeks for its citizens in the same situation abroad,' she said in the Australian Parliament recently.

'We urge the Indonesian government to show the same mercy to Andrew and Myuran as it seeks for its citizens in the same situation abroad,' Australia's Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop told Parliament recently

With an estimated 360 Indonesians facing the death penalty abroad - about 230 of those on drug charges - Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has warned Indonesia's plans to proceed with the Bali Nine executions could risk the lives of its own citizens. 

Ms Bishop pointed to the case of Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad, an Indonesian maid who was saved  from beheading in Saudi Arabia by the previous Indonesian government after being convicted of murdering her elderly employer.

It's reported Indonesia paid $2.1 million to stop the execution and that President Joko Widodo was among the politicians calling for mercy at the time.

While President Widodo lobbies for his own people, he continues to reject Australia's appeals for clemency for the Bali Nine pair.

Widodo told Al Jazeera Televsion that  his role, as Head of State, is to protect his citizens.

'But at the same time, we have to respect other countries that apply capital punishment,' he said.  

Last year, Indonesia made a substantial payment to a Saudi family to halt the impending execution of Indonesian maid, Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad.  Her sister-in-law, Sulastri, holds her photo in Central Java last year

Last month, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi told theJakarta Post that the Indonesian government was committed to helping release 229 Indonesian nationals  on death row around the world.

'The state is giving assistance by providing them with lawyers and regular visits in the prisons and carrying out diplomatic efforts with local authorities to solve the issue,' Retno told reporters. 

She also said President Widodo had ordered all Indonesian embassies and consulates 'to unite the death row convicts with their families as this would be helpful for their psychological well-being.'

Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi says Indonesia is committed to helping release 229 Indonesian nationals on death row around the world - despite refusing to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran

Ms Bishop told the Australian Parliament last month that Indonesian organisations like  Migrant Care and the National Commission on Human Rights, say Indonesia's  policy of proceeding with executions at home 'would risk undermining its representations abroad.'

Of Chan and Sukumaran, she said Australia will not give up hope. 

'The families of these two young Australian men have spoken openly and in heartbreaking terms of their hopes for a stay of execution,' Ms Bishop said. 

'The Australian government stands resolutely with both families, after all, Australia is only doing what Indonesia is doing: making representations on behalf of Indonesian families in support of Indonesian death row prisoners abroad.' 

'I believe it is Indonesia that will lose the most from executing these two young men.'

The legal appeal for condemned Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be heard in a Jakarta court on Thursday.

It comes after Friday's news that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's executions have been indefinitely delayed due to ongoing legal proceedings.

The delay and new appeal have been welcomed by the pair's legal team, as well as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, both of whom have voiced their optimism at the prospect for a repeal to the execution sentence, reports Yahoo News. 

The new appeal will be the men's second challenge to the clemency bid which was rejected in January. 

Julian McMahon (C), the lawyer for Bali Nine pair. The condemned Australian's legal team said the delay was a 'welcome development' as it represented a change to the previous position of the Indonesian Government'

Michael O'Connell, one of the lawyers for the two Australians, said the delay was a 'welcome development' as it represented a change to the previous position of Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo.

'The indications that we've had yesterday are encouraging because there does now appear to be some regard to his principles.'

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped the appeal represented a possible shift in the stance of the Indonesian government.

'There could be other reasons for the delay but I hope, in my heart, that it's a change of mind,' she said. 

Drug trafficker Scott Rush is led away for interrogation at Bali Police Headquarters. The now 29 year old has voiced his sympathy for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran after hearing they will face the firing squad

It comes after Scott Rush- one of the Bali Nine members who had his sentence changed from death to life in prison-has spoken out about his sympathy for the pair.

Rush, 29, told The Weekend Australian via a friend he was 'shocked and heartbroken' by news of the their fate.

'I am praying for Myuran and Andrew and for the other condemned prisoners that even at this time mercy can't be shown,' he said.

'I send love and prayers to the families and loved ones. May God bless them all,' Mr Rush reportedly said.

One of the Brisbane man's lawyers said that while his client was saddened by the destiny of the condemned duo, the reports he felt guilty were inaccurate.

News has also surfaced that Chan and Sukumaran's families have been blocked from visiting them on Nusakambangan Island. 

Australian consular officials are seeking leniency for the devastated families, but Indonesian Officials have vowed there will be no concessions made.

'No exception. We can't make allowances for certain families only. It won't be fair for the others,'  Central Java Justice Officer Mirza Zukarnain told The Age.

Tensions between Indonesia and Australia are also running high, with Australia lodging a formal complaint to the Indonesian ambassador on Thursday over the treatment of the two men during their transfer to death island. 

Scores of heavily armed police accompanied Chan and Sukumaran during the transfer, during which an image was taken that sparked national outrage.

Ms Bishop described the image as 'undignified and degrading' in the complaint lodged on Friday.
