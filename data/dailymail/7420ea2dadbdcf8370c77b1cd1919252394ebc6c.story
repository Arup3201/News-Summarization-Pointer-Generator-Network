This year's race of veteran cars from London's Hyde Park to the seaside in Brighton has a few familiar faces, including formidable Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood and Olympic rowing great Sir Steve Redgrave.

Mr Hollywood is driving a De Dion Bouton belonging to the Beaulieu Museum, while Sir Steve took charge of a 110-year-old Thornycroft in the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run today.

Also taking part were Ross Brawn, who is taking a sabbatical from Formula 1 after leaving the Mercedes Grand Prix team earlier this year, driving his own veteran car - the only known surviving British-built Wilson Pilcher.

Another Olympic star, Sir Ben Ainslie, was on hand, to help Sir Steve and Mr Hollywood tear the red flag at the start of the run at The Mall in central London.

Around 500 vehicles participate in the 60-mile event, which attracts entrants from across the globes, and sees the owners of highly valuable rare cars enjoy a rare opportunity to take them our for a spin.

And while the majority of the cars came from the UK, there are also vehicles from the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark and Australia. 

Sir Steve is driving a 1904 Thornycroft in this year's event, which kicked off earlier today. 

The car belongs to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust based at the Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon and last month, he visited the centre to take some lessons in preparation.

And despite the weather, enthusiastic motorists smiled for the cameras despite very few of the cars offering any protection against the elements.

But a few of the vehicles showed their age, with one catching fire and others trailing dust or needing a push to get going.

Built in 1905, the vintage car is expected to go for between £340,000 and £360,000 at Bonhams on October 31

A rare 109-year-old French steam-powered car bought by a farmer for £450 has sold for £371,100 at auction.

The Gardner-Serpollet 18HP Type L Phaeton Steamer was one of the first-ever vehicles on Britain's roads in 1905.

Its first owner was steam car enthusiast Alec Hodson who sold it to farmer George Milligan in 1957 for £450 - roughly £9,467 in today's money.

In 2009 Mr Milligan sold the car at auction in London for £238,000 and just five years later it is being sold again - and is expected to make another £100,000 profit.

The historic steamer - which has the number plate AH 100 - is set to fetch between £340,000 and £360,000 when it is auctioned on October 31.

The car is still going strong and is due to take part in the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run on November 2.?

It was voted the historically most important car in the 2010 event.

Bonhams said Mr Milligan had an 'amazing collection' of early motor cars.

One of them, a 1929 super-charged Mercedes-Benz SSK, sold at the auction house for £4.18 million in 2004.

The car, voted the most historically important car in 2010's London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, is still going strong and is taking part in this year's event.
