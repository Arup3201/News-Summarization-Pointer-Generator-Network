Swansea boss Garry Monk says Wayne Routledge deserves his new contract after finding a home at the Liberty Stadium.

Routledge represented eight different clubs before joining Swansea in August 2011 and has since played a big part in the Welsh club establishing itself in the Barclays Premier League as well as winning the Capital One Cup in 2013.

The 29-year-old winger has signed an extended one-year deal which will keep him at Swansea until 2018.

'He thoroughly deserves it because of his commitment to his club and how he's been,' said Monk, speaking ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Sunderland.

'He's found a home, somewhere he can be himself and bring out the player we now see week in week out.

'He's an experienced professional and what he brings to the squad is very valuable.

'He's been around at a lot of top clubs and seen a lot of things, but he has to trust you first before he opens up.

'He'll admit himself, a little bit he rebelled at times as a youngster but I think he never clicked at clubs where he felt he could express himself.

'Perhaps he was unsure of what he was capable of, but here he's had that freedom and guidance to be better.

'He does extras in training, he wants to improve all the time and it's great to have him here.'

Swansea head to the Stadium of Light on the back of successive league defeats to Chelsea and Southampton after opening up with three straight wins.

But Swansea bounced back with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Everton in the Capital One Cup in midweek, the club's first-ever victory over the Merseysiders.

'The morale hadn't gone, the boys are fine,' Monk said. 'They are at the same level as they were at the start of the season and every game because of the way we've performed.

'Wins give you momentum and it's nice to go into the next game with a win behind you, but we're not concentrating on that.

'We're looking at performance levels every day and in games which have been there every time.'

Monk has Wilfried Bony available again after last season's 25-goal marksman served his one-match suspension for being sent off against Southampton last weekend in midweek.

Bony has yet to score this season but Monk has faith the Ivory Coast forward will soon be on the scoresheet.

'I don't put pressure on players, it's about the contribution,' Monk said. 'It's good the goals are spread out. It's good for strikers to score, but we don't need to put pressure on.

'They're good characters and it won't be long before they're scoring again.'
