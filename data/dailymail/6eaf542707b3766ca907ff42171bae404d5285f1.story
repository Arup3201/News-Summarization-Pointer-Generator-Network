A slimming advert featuring former Loose Women star Denise Welch has been banned after a watchdog said her two-stone weight loss in two months was too fast.

The 56-year-old's before and after photos sparked a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after they featured in a social media campaign for diet firm LighterLife.

Today Ms Welch hit out at the ruling - and said watchdog officials 'need to get out more'.

Weight loss: The Advertising Standards Authority has banned a slimming advert which showed before (above) and after photos of Loose Women's former star Denise Welch

Online: The disputed adverts appeared on the Facebook page for slimming firm LighterLife

The Facebook page for the slimming firm, for whom the former Coronation Street actress is an ambassador, featured her pictures with the boast: 'Denise lost two stone in just two months.'

It sparked a complaint which challenged whether the ad complied with rules on weight-loss advertising, which say a loss of more than two pounds a week can be unhealthy.

Ms Welch's weight loss was around four and a half pounds a week.

The ASA said claims of exact weight loss had to be 'must be compatible with good medical and nutritional practice'.

Backlash: Ms Welch said officials needed to 'get out more' and her weight loss was totally healthy

So it banned the advert from appearing in the same form again, despite acknowledging Ms Welch had faced potential health problems from being overweight.

'We understood that Denise Welch had been classed as overweight when her weight loss programme began and also that her waist circumference was very high, which put her at high risk of health problems,' the ruling said.

'However, the code specified that for those who were normally overweight, a rate of weight loss greater than 2lb a week was unlikely to be compatible with good medical and nutritional practice.

'While we understood that LighterLife had given an account of the actual rate of weight loss experienced by Ms Welch, we noted the rate advertised was greater than 2lb per week.

'We had not seen evidence to demonstrate that the rate of loss experienced by Ms Welch was compatible with code requirements.

'We told LighterLife to ensure that rates of weight loss were compatible with good medical and nutritional practice and that treatments for obesity were not advertised to the public without suitably qualified supervision.' 

The actress hit out at the ruling, saying: 'The Advertising Standards people need to get out more.

'Weight loss companies are trying to help people, and yet they aren't even allowed to tell us what they can do for us.

'And LighterLife has been prevented from using my weight loss before and after photos as the ASA says I lost weight too quickly. How can that be right, when the Foodpacks comply with all the nutritional rules, including Trading Standards, and I did exactly what I was supposed to do with them.

'I felt better than I had for ages, and those are genuine before and after pictures.

'Meanwhile obesity is increasing [and] people are dying from cancer, heart disease and diabetes.'

In its submissions to the ASA, LighterLife said Ms Welch's weight loss was in line with expected results for those on a very low calorie diet (VLCD) programme.

A spokesman for LighterLife said Ms Welch had eaten more than 600 calories a day to meet guidelines

It added that while the rate was greater than 2lb a week, this did not mean that it was incompatible with good  practice.

Ms Welch also ate more than 600 calories a day, in accordance with guidelines by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).

LighterLife medical director Dr Matt Capehorn said: 'This shows just why Britain is in its current mess, with one of the biggest obesity problems on the planet.

'There is something wrong when weight loss companies are trying to help dieters, and bureaucracy gets in the way.'
