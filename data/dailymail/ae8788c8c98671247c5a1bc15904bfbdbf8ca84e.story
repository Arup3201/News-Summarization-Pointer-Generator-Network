A 22-year-old man who allegedly went on a gruesome murder spree has baffled cops as they try to figure out what drove him to carry out the attacks.

Bryan Clay was charged in the savage killing of a mom and daughter in Las Vegas after a week-long man hunt.

He is alleged to have bludgeoned to death 10-year-old Karla Martinez and her mother, Ignacia Martinez at their Robin Street home last Saturday, in an apparent random crime.

Savage: Brian Clay allegedly bludgeoned to death the mother and daughter at their Las Vegas home

Karla’s father, Arturo Martinez, 39, was critically injured in the bludgeoning attack and remains in hospital with head injuries.

'We believe this was a stranger, a random savage act,' Lt. Ray Steiber of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police's homicide division said at a news conference. 'I've been doing this 24 years and this is the case you hope you never see.'

Ignacia and Arturo’s 9-year-old son 
tragically discovered the slain bodies of his mother and sister, going 
into school and telling teachers at his Mabel Hoggard Elementary School 
that they had been killed by his dad.

Police later rejected the 
allegation and have since then been combing through the 'nightmare' crime scene house which they said has blood in every room.

Lt. Lundquist said: ‘This is the 
kind of case that goes on that they write movies about and I don’t say 
that as to be an entertainment factor.

'I'm saying this was a savage, 
heinous crime.’

Karla had been raped prior to her 
death, Las Vegas Metro police said in a press conference on Friday.

While officers tried to piece together the events leading up to the murders, they said Clay had carried out a separate sexual assault, against a 
50-year-old woman the day before the bloody murders.

Metro Lt. Rob Lundquist said Clay 
began chasing the woman at around 2am on April 15, grabing her and 
dragging her into a desert area and violently attacking her in what 
became a sexual assault.

'We're talking about a 50-year-old woman who was attacked, brutally attacked, and she was sexually assaulted,' Steiber said. 'We're talking about a family who was in their home and unbeknownst to them, a savage intruder enters that home and attacks three people.'

Police said they are treating the 
crimes as unrelated and do not believe Clay had any relationship with 
his victims prior to the attacks. 'They believe that this was a 
stranger, no way connected to the family or with the other victim,' 
Officer Laura Meltzer told ABCNews.com. 'He is in custody and will
not be getting back out.'

Officers launched a thorough investigation of the crime scene, with up to 60 officers working on the case at one stage.

Clay was arrested on a child abuse charge and is to be re-booked as soon as possible on charges of sexual assault and murder.

The murders have sent shockwaves 
through the community, especially at the Real KO Boxing Club in North 
Las Vegas, where both Arturo and Ignacia Martinez worked and were viewed
as positive role models.

Those who knew them say that the couple, both trained fighters, would not have gone quietly if attacked or robbed.

Felipe Lazos, a 16-year-old who trained at Real KO Boxing, told the Review-Journal that the attacker would have 'had to be a good fighter'.

Neighbor Lucinda Jackson-Griffin said
she had never heard disturbances at the home until she was woken by 
gunshots on Monday morning, but police are now saying that a gun was not
used in the killings.

Another, Juliana Maqueda-Perez,
said she heard a man screaming in English and a child crying in the 
early hours of the morning, the Review-Journal reported.

'I walked past there every day,' neighbor Dick Webb, 82, said about the house.

He said he had walked past the house less than 90 minutes before the boy arrived at school but hadn't seen anything amiss.

Police originally blocked the area around the single-story stucco home to await a warrant to enter and retrieve the bodies.

Animal control officers arrived to remove a dog from the house. An 
officer said it was not harmed but had been taken away as no one was 
there to care for it.

School
Principal Celese Rayford declined to comment, and Clark County School 
District spokeswomen provided no immediate information about the student
or whether the other 457 students in grades kindergarten through 5 were
told about the case.

Police said the two surviving children from the attack remain with Child Protective Services.

Friend and next-door neighbour Mark Groenert told Fox 5 Vegas: 'It's so sad. I knew them all. And it's sad and tragic'.
