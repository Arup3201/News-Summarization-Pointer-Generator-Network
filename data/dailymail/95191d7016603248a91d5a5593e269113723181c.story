Allegations: Nurse Rosebud June Fazakerley, pictured, is accused of threatening to beat up a fellow nurse the 'African Way'

A care home nurse threatened to teach a colleague a lesson by beating her up 'in the African way' during an aggressive outburst, a tribunal heard.

Rosebud Fazackerley allegedly threatened to attack fellow nurse Carla Perestrelo, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told today.

'Ms Fazackerley spoke in loud tones, 
she was pacing the room, using her arms, and alternating between 
shouting and aggressive body language', said Rachel Ellis, for the NMC.

'During the registrant's rant, she 
threatened to wait outside for Ms Perestrelo and beat her b****h's ass 
and beat her in the African way, or words to that effect.'

Ms Fazackerley's rant came after she had been demoted by manager Sharon Walker at Highlands Luxury Care Home in St Saviour, Jersey, she added.

It was claimed Ms Fazackerley had been transferred there after begging colleagues at her former workplace La
Haule Care Home, in St Brelade, to help her sick mother before blowing it on rent and holidays, a hearing was told.

Fazackerley borrowed more than
£1,000 from care assistants while telling them it would be used to pay 
medical bills, it was said.

But she was living in an expensive flat and jetting off on holiday while sponging off workmates, the tribunal was told.

Fazackerley, who only paid back £100 
of the various loans, is also said to have obtained a free bed from the 
Jersey care home where she worked after claiming she was short of cash.

Shortly after being transferred to Highlands Luxury Care Home, tensions mounted between Fazackerley and manager Sharon Walker, the tribunal was told.

'Ms Fazackerley made comments about 
Sharon Walker that she was not a proper manager and she would bring her 
down', Ms Ellis said.

'The registrant also suggested a care 
assistant was transferred to the home because she was having a sexual 
relationship with a resident.

'By the way the registrant was speaking, it was not interpreted as colleagues gossiping or having a laugh.'

Fazackerley's outburst is said to have
happened during evening handover on October 21, 2010, less than a month
after she was transferred by employers Four Seasons Health Care to 
Highlands Luxury Care Home in St Saviour, Jersey.

Several of her former colleagues at La
Haule Care Home, in St Brelade, Jersey, which is run by the same firm, 
had complained that she had accepted loans and failed to pay them back.

'The registrant approached Tom 
Colville, a senior care assistant on May 2009, initially asking for £300
before increasing the request to £600', said Ms Ellis.

'Mr Colville gave him £600 and the registrant told him she would pay him back when she got paid.

'However, when she got paid she made no mention of the money and did not pay him back.

'She then asked for a further £300 to pay for rent, which Mr Colville loaned her.'

Fazackerley has admitted only giving 
Mr Colville £100 back of the £900 she took, but denies cheating other 
colleagues out of money.

She is accused of asking for £100 
apiece from two care assistants, telling them she needed money for her 
daughter and for her sick mother's medical treatment.

Fazackerley is then said to have taken
another loan from a fourth colleague of between £60 and £75, which she 
failed to pay back.

Fazackerley, then the deputy manager 
of the elderly care home, was investigated by Ms Walker over the loans, 
which were made between January and August 2009.

'There are a number of witnesses who 
will say the registrant asked to borrow money because she was short of 
money', Ms Ellis said.

'Tom Colville will say that after he lent the registrant money, she went on an expensive holiday.

'Another witness, Lee Edwardson, gives evidence that the home gave the registrant a bed because she was short of money.

'He delivered the bed to a top of the range flat he describes as being very expensive.

'All the people she borrowed money from were care assistants, and her means were higher.'

Fazackerley has admitted borrowing £900 from Mr Colville and repaying just £100.

She denies the eight other charges she faces.

If found guilty of misconduct she could be kicked out of the profession.

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
