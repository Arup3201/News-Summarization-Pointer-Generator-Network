An interactive map of the Japanese coast devastated by a huge tsunami in March 2011 has been launched that lets web users tour the dilapidated areas.

The photographs on Google's Street View are a chilling reminder of the massive earthquake that rocked the area and triggered the tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people and caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

The images that make up Google's 'Memories for the Future' project include photographs of towns and villages near the stricken power plant where high radiation levels have left people unable to return to their homes, as well as memories of happier times before the earthquake struck.

The images include photographs of towns and villages near the stricken power plant where high radiation levels have left people unable to return to their homes, as well as memories of happier times before the earthquake struck - including this shopping street

Some villages snapped show rebuilding is under way, while others illustrate nature reclaiming shells of broken buildings.

Thanks to timing options on the interactive map, users can explore the region before the disaster and afterwards, to compare photos and really understand the devastation caused.

Google has mapped the largely deserted streets of 12 towns and villages including Futaba and Okuma in the region where the power station is situated.

The images are part of a project named 'Memories for the Future' which pins photographs and videos of local landmarks taken by the general public to the appropriate locations on the map.

More than 18,000 people lost their lives when the 9.0 magnitude sub-sea earthquake sent an enormous wave crashing into Japan's northeast coast. Here a boat lies in the middle of a road

The catastrophic natural event broke the cooling systems of the coastal nuclear power station, sending the reactors into meltdown and causing thousands of local people to flee the area, as well as global panic. This is the same road before the tsunami

Interested web users can tour evacuation zones from the safety of their own homes, including Iitate, Katsurao, Kawauchi, Naraha, Hirono, and Minamisoma.

The images of the streets were taken as late as August this year, according to a Google spokesman in Japan and can be seen at: http://www.miraikioku.com/en/

In March, Google released panoramic views of Namie, a town at the heart of the original 20-kilometre exclusion zone around the blighted power plant.

into meltdown and causing thousands of local people to flee the area, as

Some villages snapped show rebuilding is under way, while others illustrate nature reclaiming shells of broken buildings. This road has been turned into scrub land by the natural catastrophe

Before the tsunami the same road used to be part of a leafy residential area. Google has mapped the largely deserted streets of 12 towns and villages including Futaba and Okuma in the region where the power station is situated

So far no-one has officially died as a result of radiation sickness cause by the nuclear meltdown, but experts believe that some areas close to the power station will be contaminated for decades.

Currently, residents are allowed to return to certain parts of the outer exclusion zone but are not allowed to stay overnight, to minimise their exposure to radiation, CNN International reported.

Teams of workers have the unenviable job of scraping the top layer of soil and grass into bags to remove some radiation as part of a government-funded operation that will cost over Â£1bn by the end of this financial year.

It is thought around 8,000 people are working on the clean-up operation in the region every day and now only wear gloves and a face mask instead of a full protection suit, which they would have donned a year ago.

But the same area was much more built up before. The images of the streets were taken as late as August this year, according to a Google spokesman in Japan
