Art Donovan, who was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1968 after winning two world championships with the Baltimore Colts, died on Sunday

Legendary American Football player Art Donovan, who enjoyed a second career on the talk show circuit, died yesterday, aged 89.

The Hall of Fame lineman won two world championships with the Baltimore Colts in 1958 and 1959 and also spent single seasons with the New York Yanks and Dallas Texans before retiring in 1961.

Donovan died at 7.20pm at the Stella Maris Hospice in Baltimore, Kevin Byrne, senior vice president of public and community relations for the Baltimore Ravens announced.

He was surrounded by more than a dozen family members.

Tributes have poured in for Donovan - nicknamed Fatso - who became famous after retirement for his hilarious stories about his playing career.

Ordell Braase, Donovan's teammate, told The Baltimore Sun: 'Artie made a career out of telling people everything that he'd done right - and wrong - in football.

'The diversity of his appeal was amazing. Everyone wanted to hug "Fatso," from young girls to little old ladies.'

Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said: 'We lost a friend, one of the finest men and one of the greatest characters we were fortunate to meet in this community and in this business.  

'Baltimore is now without one of its 
best and someone who was a foundation for the tremendous popularity of 
football in our area.

'The world is not as bright tonight because we lost someone who could make us all smile.'

Donovan enjoyed a second career as a storyteller on the talk show circuit and penned a successful autobiography

Donovan was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1968.

Hall of Fame center Jim Ringo, who died in 2007, once said: 'Some of the greatest football ever played by a defensive tackle was played by Art Donovan.

'He was one of the greatest people I played against all my life.'

Donovan
played in the 1958 championship game between the Colts and New York 
Giants, a contest that was decided in overtime and ultimately tabbed by 
some football historians as 'The Greatest Game Ever Played.'

The winner's share was $4,700 and the most Donovan ever earned in one season was $22,000.

Teammates said Donovan, pictured in 1962, played 'some of the greatest football' by a defensive tackle in the game's history

However,
he maintained his fame after retirement by touring the talk show 
circuit and through his successful autobiography called 'Fatso'.

Donovan liked to say he was a light eater, 'When it got light, I started eating.' 

Donovan, who was 6ft 3" tall, weighed about 300 pounds for most of his life but his playing weight was listed at 265 pounds.

'I've
never been a gourmet eater,' he wrote. 'Kosher hot dogs, cheeseburgers,
pizza, baloney, and a couple of cases of Schlitz are all I'd need on a 
desert isle.'

Donovan's father was Arthur J. Donovan Sr., one of boxing's most famous referees, who marshalled 19 of Joe Louis' title fights.

Donovan held the Colts to two world championships and was known in later life as a great storyteller 

When the younger Donovan grew up and left the tough New York neighborhood he was brought up in, he fought in World War II and played college football at Notre Dame and Boston College. 

The late John Steadman, a sportswriter for The (Baltimore) Sun who covered the Colts in their glory years, once said: 'Art is a tremendous example for everyone, a wonderful Santa Claus-type individual.'

Donovan broke into professional football in 1950 with the Colts, who folded after his rookie season.

He played with the Yanks in 1951 and Texans in 1952 before the Dallas franchise moved to Baltimore and became the second version of the Colts.
