You might see a piece of scrap paper when you look at that out-of-date tax disc stuck behind your current one… but Jude Currie sees something precious.

The 12-year-old has amassed a 12,000-strong collection of vehicle excise licence discs which is currently valued at £10,000.

No surprise then that the schoolboy is incensed at the Government’s decision to axe the perforated bits of paper from October 1.

Jude Currie, 12, has collected 12,000 car tax discs over the last five years, with discs dating back to 1926

While the move may help the value of his collection rise, he is ‘gutted’ at the end of a 93-year tradition.

Jude, from Cobham, Surrey has been collecting discs since he was seven, after spotting a colourful one on the windscreen of an abandoned Fiat. Now he has thousands, dating from 1926 to the present day.

His first discs came from cars in scrap yards after he begged his parents Garnet and Candice to take him there. 

Over 1.7billion tax discs have been issued since their creation in 1921 – if they were put in a line, they would go around the world three times.

Last year, the DVLA issued 42.2million tax discs weighing over 72 tonnes – that’s heavier than a Challenger 2 tank. 

‘I’m always excited when I find old tax discs I don’t have,’ he said.

The collecting of tax discs – known as velology – can be lucrative. Anything pre-1940s can make up to £100 on eBay and even discs from the 60s and 70s can command a tenner.

Jude said: ‘I keep my collection in date order in folders. Some of my favourites are from the 1960s, 70s and 80s, as they have nice colours and are well laid out.

‘Just because the tax discs are being stopped doesn’t mean I’m going to stop collecting. There are still so many more I want to collect.’

As well as his impressive disc collection, Jude has also collected 600 car hubcaps.

Mr Currie, 58, said: ‘Jude loves all paraphernalia relating to the motor trade – he is very knowledgeable.

‘He will even call out if there is a discarded hubcap on the road and I’ll have to pull over and pick it up so he can add it to his collection.’

Tax discs will be axed from October 1 - this Wednesday - angering Jude, despite the expected increased in value of his extensive collection
