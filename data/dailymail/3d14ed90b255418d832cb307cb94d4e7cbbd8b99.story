A man with a 17-hour erection had to have three pints of drained from his penis to relieve the problem.

Jason Garnett, 23, described the situation as 'pure agony' and said he could only watch in horror as a doctor stabbed a cannula into the side of his manhood.

He was diagnosed with a condition known as priapism - caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis. 

Doctors told him they would have to draw off blood to reduce the pressure.

Jason Garnett, 23, could only watch in horror as a doctor stabbed a cannula into the side of his penis

'Seeing them stab my penis with a needle was horrible - like something out of a horror film,' said Mr Garner, a hotel worker from Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

'They were injecting me with adrenalin - and had to do it 24 times.'

Doctors had warned that if the injections failed to work, they would have to operate. 

The incident occurred last week after he spent the drinking heavily before sleeping with a female friend - and not taking Viagra, he insists.

'I got home went to sleep for a bit,' he told MailOnline. 'I woke up at 9am and it was there, but lots of guys have that in the morning.'

But by midday, the began to get concerned. 'It started to get really sore, and I looked on the internet to see what it could be.

'I tried putting an ice pack on it, sitting in a bath with some ice and even went for a run around the block with it tucked into my belt.'

While he could urinate, he admits it was quite difficult.  

By late afternoon, the pain was unbearable and he got his house mate to drive him to hospital.

'At first, he was in hysterics, but then realised how serious it was,' he said. 

Priapism usually affects men but in rare cases, can affect women too.

The condition is where a penis or clitoris becomes engorged with blood, causing a painful, long-lasting erection.

It is caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis.

Also, a number of medications can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of the nerves that help trigger an erection by widening the arteries in the penis.

The nerves essentially ‘forget’ to narrow the arteries after the feelings of sexual arousal have passed, leading to priapism.

Those that have been linked to priapism include anti-depressants, erectile dysfunction medication and some recreational drugs.

'I was in so much pain when I arrived at the desk that I can't remember exactly what I said - but I made the staff laugh,' he recalled. 

Two hours later, a urologist arrived from another hospital to treat him. 

'He warned me he would have to draw the blood out by stabbing the side of my penis with a cannula.

'At that point I thought "just hurry up" - it really, really, really, really hurt.' 

The doctor drained two pints of blood - and the remainder was left to drip out onto an absorbent pad. 

'I think in total there was about three-and-a-half pints that came out,' said Mr Garnett.

'The urologist said he had never seen anything like it.'

Even after the blood had been drained, the erection remained.  It was only at 2am that the problem subsided - after 24 injections. 

Such was the extent of his blood loss and the effect on his blood pressure of the adrenalin injections, Mr Garnett had to spend Friday to Monday in hospital. 

Fortunately, he has been reassured there will be no long-term damage. But doctors can't rule out the problem occurring again. 

'I'm not worried about it, though,' said Mr Garnett. 'The girls will love it.' 

Due to the amount of blood he lost, and the effect of the adrenaline shots on his body, Mr Garnett had to stay in hospital for three nights
