Gifted: Swimmer Chloe Waddell has collapsed and died hours after celebrating winning a clutch of swimming awards at a sports ceremony

A gifted schoolgirl tipped to represent Team GB at the next Olympics collapsed and died just hours after she celebrated winning a clutch of swimming awards at a sports ceremony.

Chloe Waddell, 16, had gone to a party with friends after receiving a series of trophies at a presentation evening - but was taken ill at home the following morning.

The Year 10 pupil took part in the London 2012 Olympics trials last year where she competed against Rebecca Adlington. She had represented Great Britain.

She was rushed to hospital but died just minutes later, despite the efforts of doctors to save her.

British Swimming said in a statement: 'British Swimming sends its thoughts and condolences to the parents, family, friends and team-mates of Chloe Waddell following the news that the Swim Trafford swimmer passed away on Sunday morning.

'Sixteen-year-old Chloe was one of the squad's most promising young stars and had gone from strength to strength since joining the squad several years ago.'

James Stannard, Swim Trafford's head performance coach said: 'We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of Chloe and as a small squad, this news has rocked us.'

The cause of her death is unknown but police today ruled out gossip on social media sites that Chloe’s death was down to excessive alcohol consumption.

However, they are examining claims Chloe may have accidentally tripped over during the party and hit her head shortly before she was collected and taken home by her businessman father David, 50 and 46-year old mother Fiona.

It is believed the family kept watch upon her overnight at their £400,000 house in Timperley, near Altrincham, Greater Manchester before her condition worsened at 8.30am on Sunday and an ambulance was called.

Today, tributes poured in for Chloe who who was due to take her GCSEs at the 1,350 pupil Altrincham Girls Grammar School - one of the most prestigious and successful girls' grammar schools in the UK.

Chloe had represented Great Britain in an Open Water Talent Camp in France in the summer of 2012 and was tipped to swim for Team GB in the next Olympics after qualifying at trials.

Last year she won a bronze medal at School Games in London, May 2012 at the Olympic Aquatics Centre - an event which involves the most talented athletes from the whole country.
