A holiday company which offers ‘Barbie VIP packages’ to parents of girls as young as two has come under fire for gender stereotyping.

The luxury five-star Forte Village Resort in Sardinia has been criticised for launching the ‘Barbie packages’ - which are aimed at girls aged between two and 13 - at a cost of £364 a week.

According to the travel company’s website, the two packages – called Pink and Glamour – offer ‘unforgettable’ Barbie experiences including learning how to walk the runway, having spa treatments and being made-up with ‘glamorous make-up and hairstyling’.

Youngsters who partake in the week-long package will spend time in the specially-created pink Barbie house, while parents relax in the resort where a week-long holiday would cost a family of four more than £4,000.

However, the ‘Barbie packages’, launched this summer, have come under fire from critics who have described them as ‘shocking’ and suggest they infer outdated gender stereotypes.

Megan Perryman, co-founder of the group Let Toys Be Toys, which lobbies to stop gender-specific toys and books, said the packages ‘perpetuates this message that girls and boys should behave in certain ways instead of treating them like individuals’.

She told The Guardian: ‘It's pretty shocking, particularly that it's aimed at girls as young as two.’

And writer Caroline Criado-Perez, who led a campaign to have more women represented on British banknotes, described the packages as ‘depressing’.

She told the newspaper that they sent a limited message to both girls and boys about how they should behave.

‘What I find so disheartening about this is that we push these things on little girls from such an early age – they must like pink, they are supposed to enjoy everyone looking at them, that they must prettify themselves – and then when they reach adulthood we vilify them for caring about how they look,’ she said.

A spokesman for Forte Village said the packages had so far been popular and provided a safe environment for girls to play.

There are two packages for guests to choose from - the Glamour package, which costs £445 per week, and the Pink package, which costs £364.

The holiday company claims the most expensive package of the two allows youngsters to be ‘treated to the ultimate Barbie style bedroom’, a toiletry bag, exclusive gift and Barbie doll.

It also lets mothers access the spa with their daughters where they will be offered treatments including manicures and a face mask treatment.

Youngsters are also given the opportunity to partake in a five-day ‘Barbie fashion academy’ where they will create t-shirts, jewellery and photo frames before being glammed up and learning to walk the runway.

In a separate package, the Royal Caribbean cruise company also offers offers girls aged four to 11 the Barbie Premium Experience, which is described as a 'Barbie dream cruise complete with fun, fashion and runway moments'.
