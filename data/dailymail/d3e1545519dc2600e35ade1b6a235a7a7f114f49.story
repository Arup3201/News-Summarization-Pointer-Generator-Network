A mystery footprint has been spotted at a millionaire’s mansion in the bedroom where his girlfriend was just minutes before she allegedly hanged herself.

Rebecca Zahau, 32, died at the mansion of Jonah Shacknai, 54, in Coronado, California, in July, two days after his son Max, 6, was fatally hurt from a fall off the stairs while she was looking after him.

The Zahau family - who continue to believe she did not commit suicide - hired a forensic expert, who believes the shoe impression on the carpet probably came from someone other than police.

Death: Rebecca Zahau, 32, left, died at the mansion of Jonah Shacknai, 54, right in Coronado, California, in July, just two days after his son Max, 6, who she was looking after, was gravely hurt from a fall off the stairs

Dr Maurice Godwin told RadarOnline.com that the toe print - pictured in the photo that formed part of police evidence - is ‘underneath the foot of the bed’, which suggests it is probably not from a cop.

Police believe Miss Zahau hanged herself after a call from Mr Shacknai told her that his son was about to die. Max died soon after Miss Zahau was found hanging at Mr Shacknai’s mansion.

Police said Rebecca was alone – but the family are not convinced and believe she could have been murdered. This footprint suggests there could have been another person in the bedroom with her.

RadarOnline.com also reported that a witness who claims to have heard a ‘scream for help’ hours before she was found dead was twice ignored by police when they tried to report the information.

Murder or suicide? The 'pink rope,' shown in this crime scene photo, is what police say Rebecca Zahau hanged herself with at her boyfriend's California mansion

The person contacted the family of the
 dead woman last Wednesday with the information, which 
casts doubt on the conclusion that she committed suicide.

'This
 witness is credible and their information has been verified, so one is 
left to wonder why police did not listen to this individual,' a member 
of the Zahau family told RadarOnline.

According
 to the witness, they heard a scream from the mansion at 11pm local 
time. Police concluded that Miss Zahau committed suicide at 3am.

New
 evidence has also cast doubt on the conclusions about his death too. 
The boy's physician, Dr Brad Peterson, was quoted in a search warrant 
saying suffocation may have occurred prior to his fall.

Manchester United fan: Max was revealed to have broken his spinal cord in his fall, and was not breathing and had no pulse when he was found

Max was found unconscious at the base 
of the stairs at his father's vacation home in California, where Miss 
Zahau was discovered dead two days later.

Max’s death was determined an 
accident.

His neck was 
broken and he was found not breathing and with no pulse by Ms Zahau at 
the bottom of the stairs after she heard a noise and came to look.

She 
was the only adult at home at the time.

Miss
 Zahau and her teenage sister Xena were the only people at home at the 
time of Max's accident.

Cops contend Miss Zahau was in the bathroom when
 it happened and Xena was in the shower.

When
 Miss Zahau's naked body was found hanging from the mansion's balcony 
with her ankles and wrists bound, investigators were quick to say they 
were not ruling out suicide.

They
 eventually determined no evidence of foul play, sexual assault or a 
struggle. She was alive when she went over the balcony and died by 
hanging.

There was no alcohol or drugs in her system.

Mr
 Shacknai has two children with his first wife, Kimberly. Max was his 
only child with his second wife, Dina, whom he divorced in 2008.
