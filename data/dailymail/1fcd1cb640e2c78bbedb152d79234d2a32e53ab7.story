Hundreds of anarchists clashed with police on the streets of Seattle yesterday, during the annual May Day riots.

The protestors marked International Workers' Day by marching peacefully while carrying banners branded with slogans such as 'Die Yuppie Scum' and 'Anti-Capitalism and Anti-State'. However, a violent minority caused trouble once the sun went down, waging running battles with police officers.

There most high profile action was setting fire to dumpsters in the road of one of the city's major junctions.

Nine men, aged between 17 and 37, were arrested as a peaceful day gave way to a violent evening on a march that was still relatively quiet compared to those in each of last two years.

At one point, police fired pepper spray into the crowd, claiming that bottles and other missiles had been thrown at them. They also recovered a gun from one of the marchers.

While there was a general theme of workers' rights and immigration reform, the protestors were not rallying behind a single unifying cause. Rather, different groups brought their own agendas as the crowd made its way from Capitol Hill to the city's downtown area and then back again.

Tempers frayed as the temperature soared to 30C. One protestor, carrying a banner that simply read 'F*** Off', told Seattle Pi: 'I believe in transformative justice and community accountability.

'These cops that are surrounding us right now are just the later generations of the slave catchers that caught slaves before; you know, it's just a continuation. It's modern-day slavery and that's what we're fighting against.'

Violence has plagued May Day in Seattle during the past two years, with protesters challenging police in the streets and sometimes stealing the thunder of much larger daytime events.

Last year, police arrested 18 people from a crowd that pelted them with rocks and bottles and Seattle police noted a marked uptick in anti-authority rhetoric leading up to this year's events events.

Police escorted both the permitted march of immigration and labor activists and later, unpermitted marches, allowing them to block traffic but stepping in to stop property damage.

Businesses downtown also prepared, posting security guards outside, taping paper over their windows to discourage graffiti, and using metal coat hangers to tie down iron grates along the sidewalks.Â

On of the key themes of yesterdays march was the campaign for a $15 minimum wage and, early in the day, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray announced a plan to phase it in over the next seven years.

However, Daniel Stender, 26, was at the rally holding a sign pushing for quicker action on getting to a $15 minimum wage.

'It's getting ridiculous. It's getting to the point where you can't afford things,' he said.

The police department's blog said vandals spray-painted a few businesses early Thursday in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.

Officers also found 'Kill SPD' - standing for 'Kill Seattle Police Department' - painted on walls and a flier was circulated calling for the killing of officers.
