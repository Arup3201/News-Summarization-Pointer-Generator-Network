One Direction's Harry Styles has been having facials made of bird excrement in a bid to clear up his spotty skin before the band's world tour.

The 20-year-old singer is said to have signed up for an intensive course of the anti-wrinkle and acne treatment - in which clients pay £180 to have nightingale droppings smeared on to their skin.

The unusual 'Geisha facial' is already popular in Hollywood, with Tom Cruise and Victoria Beckham among those who swear by its effectiveness.

Unusual: The anti-ageing treatment made from nightingale droppings

A new anti-wrinkle treatment is on the market in which clients pay £180 to have nightingale droppings smeared on to their skin

The Daily Star reports that Harry fears that the heavy make-up and hot lights used on tour could take their toll on his young skin - which is already prone to spots.

A source told the paper that his skin was already looking better after he embarked on the daily course of facials.

Tom Cruise, 51, started the treatments two years ago, and also believes they have dramatically improved his complexion.

Other fans include Victoria Beckham, 40, who began having the facials after a visit to Japan.

Billed as an alternative to Botox injections, the droppings – which are collected on the Japanese island of Kyushu – are mixed with rice bran and water before being applied as a mask and left to soak into the pores for an hour.

They contain enzymes which are said to break down dead skin – restoring complexions that have been damaged by ageing and sun exposure – and were traditionally used to help Japanese geisha remove the thick white make-up they were expected to wear.

Hollywood actor Tom Cruise is among those who swear by its effectiveness

The mixture apparently does not smell of excrement, but is said to have a musty odour  - similar to hay.

Emma Hu, director of the Spa to You centre at the Hilton Hotel on London's Park Lane, which has recently started offering the treatment,  said: 'The nightingales were fed on caterpillars that eat from plum trees.

'Clients are intrigued, but after the hour-long treatment users say it gives a shimmery, iridescent effect to the skin.'
