It’s been 70 years since an Indiana photographer visited New York City and returned home with an amazing collection of holiday snaps.

But Charles Weever Cushman’s pictures are even more impressive today, as they were taken on pricey colour Kodachrome and look far more recent than they actually are.

He went around the city taking photos of architecture such as the Brooklyn Bridge and other parts of the Manhattan skyline - and it’s hard to believe they were taken while World War Two was going on.

But what is 
even more intriguing are the street scenes and daily life Cushman 
documented in his photos, showing 1940s New Yorkers going about their 
daily business.

Pictures
 of children smiling for the camera, businessmen sitting down outside 
and street traders are a fascinating insight to what life was like in 
the city all those years ago.

Many of the areas have been demolished or rebuilt since they were pictured in 1941 and 1942.

But others such as McSorley’s Old Ale 
House in Manhattan’s East Village look almost identical now as they did 
back then, with the same store front and shop logo.

The images are even more significant at a time when Americans are remembering the fallen World Trade Center, showing that a city ultimately transcends its buildings, reported The Atlantic.

Mr Cushman was born in Poseyville, Indiana, in 1896 and read English at Indiana University, where he was sports editor on the student newspaper.

He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 
Illinois in 1918 before leaving three years later and began working in 
New York City in 1928. He moved back to Chicago in 1929 and died in 
1972.

His second wife, 
Elizabeth Penniman, said: ‘He loved life - music, good books, sports, 
the outdoors, travel, integrity - and could not tolerate ignorance.’
