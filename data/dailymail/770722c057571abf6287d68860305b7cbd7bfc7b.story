Three years ago she was kicked out of the U.S. for spying and faced an uncertain future.

But, as these pictures show, the arrest and deportation of Anna Chapman could well have been the best thing that ever happened to her.

The 31-year-old former spy was pictured yesterday on the same red carpet as Brad Pitt at the Moscow International Film Festival.

She was pictured looking glamorous as she posed on the red carpet at the opening ceremony of the 35th film festival.

Miss Chapman's intelligence career came to an abrupt end when, along with her nine 
colleagues, she was arrested in New York City in 2010 in an FBI 
counter-intelligence swoop.

She was then deported along with nine other Russian sleeper agents.

Before her capture, Anna Chapman worked as a New York real estate agent.

Along with other Russian sleeper agents, she lived a quiet life in a middle-class neighbourhood.

However, the Russian agents, known as illegals because they took civilian jobs instead of operating inside embassies, were being sent tasks from Moscow.

Their assignments involved burrowing deep into U.S. society and cultivating contacts with academics, entrepreneurs and government policymakers on subjects from defense to finance.

FBI videos of the Russian agents show Chapman and the other illegals surreptitiously passing information and money as part of their operations.

The Russian spy ring was exposed by the FBI on June 27, 2010.

The pin-up was quickly catapulted into the limelight as her pictures were splashed around the world.

Since then, the daughter of a senior KGB agent has become a celebrity in Russia.

She has previously appeared on the catwalk at Russian Fashion Week in Moscow clothed in a skin-tight leather ensemble.

She has also modeled, edited a magazine, given lectures and now runs a foundation.

Last year she appeared on the catwalk in the Mediterranean city of Antalya, a top Turkish vacation destination.

The Russian was flanked by two men posing as secret service agents in black suit and sunglasses.

Pitt's new film World War Z opened the Moscow Film Festival.

The actor's fellow American Christian Slater also walked the red carpet at the Pushkin Theatre.

Following state and private investment in recent years, the Russian film industry is now booming, leading to stars like Pitt and Slater attending the Moscow Film Festival.
