Jon Griffiths' holiday snaps are more extreme than most.

For a start, the majority of them were taken at more than 13,000ft high.

The 31-year-old climber has been climbing and exploring the Alps for more than ten years, and has published a book with images from his most challenging expeditions.

Climber Jon Griffith has published a book covering some of the most extreme routes he has completed. This image shows climber Ben Briggs on the first crux gendarme on the Diables Arete - Mont Blanc du Tacul

The images, which are featured in Alpine Exposures, were taken at locations across the European Alps including the breathtaking Mont Blanc mountain range crossing France, Italy and Switzerland.

Mr Griffith said: 'They are concentrated mainly on the area around Chamonix, in France, and the Mont Blanc Massif.

'Some are taken in other parts of the Alps such as the Matterhorn and the Eiger North Face.'

Mr Griffith captures the images as he climbs and they often feature his climbing partners.

He added: 'All the images in the book are real. Key to my work is that none of the shots are set up or staged which is why there is an extended caption for each image with the story behind it.'

The majority of the images were captured on peaks of 13,000ft, although some Alps photos are taken at heights of up to 15,700ft.

Jon Griffith said he was inspired to begin climbing after the death of his mother from cancer ten years ago

Mr Griffith turned to the mountains after his mother was diagnosed with, and died of, cancer.

In the book, he says: 'I experienced a grief on a level I didn't think I could ever experience.

'I've been lucky enough to lead an incredible life over the last decade which ironically was born out of those unfortunate events ten years ago and drove me to the mountains'. 

Mr Griffith uses a Canon 5D Mark III camera to capture the incredible views.

The book features images as well as short stories about each climb as well as landscape, skiing, ice climbing and paragliding photos. 

Mr Griffith said: 'I wanted to create something unique.

'I have never been happy just recreating old shots, or shooting where others have shot before.

'For me, my passion lies in climbing some of Europe's hardest routes and bringing back professional images of those routes to show to the world.

'There are plenty of stand alone images, but I also wanted to share stories about climbing some of these routes as well as some of my more interesting work shoots. 

Mr Griffith describes the mountains in the book's foreword as 'a simple and basic place removed from human-created stresses and pressures of society'.

He added: 'My favourite place is Pakistan, for me the holy grail of my work is to climb an unclimbed technical 7,000m peak out there.

'The climbing is incredibly intense and committing - to come back with images and video of these climbs is really what my last ten years as a photographer and climber has led to.'
