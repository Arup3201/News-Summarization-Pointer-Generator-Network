Junk food manufacturers are still bypassing rules on advertising unhealthy products to children and fueling the UK's obesity epidemic, a new report has claimed.

The World Health Organisation has called for tighter regulations after it said that attempts to crack down on children being targeted by TV advertising by British regulators have fallen short.

Although there are tough rules protecting youngsters from being targeted by such advertising during children's TV programmes, there are no restrictions on shows such as ITV's Britain's Got Talent and the X Factor.

Research shows that those programmes are widely enjoyed by young viewers.

Youngsters are also increasingly being targeted on social media websites, through mobile phones or through 'advergames' on food company websites.

According to The Guardian, the WHO calls for further regulations to be put in place across Europe to stop children being targeted by marketing promoting foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt.

Zsuzsanna Jakab, regional director of WHO Europe, said: 'Policy must simply catch up and address the reality of an obese childhood in the 21st century.

'Children are surrounded by adverts urging them to consume high fat, high sugar, high salt foods, even when they are in places where they should be protected, such as schools and sports facilities.'

Only five countries in Europe - Denmark, France, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden - have fully implemented EU rules on restricting marketing to children but the UK has done more than many nations.

Broadcasting regulator Ofcom has said that junk food advertising during children's television programmes dropped by almost 40 per cent between 2005 and 2009.

There has been an increase in junk food advertising at other times of the day, however.

But cutting out television advertising does not go far enough to protect young people, says the report.

In 2009, online advertising overtook television advertising in the UK and with two thirds of five to seven year olds and 85 per cent of eight to 11 year olds accessing the web through home computers, they are susceptible to seeing junk food adverts.

Many food companies are now said to be developing websites that appeal to children and feature games advertising their products and there is no restriction on the use of cartoon characters such as Kellogg's Tony the Tiger to promote products.
