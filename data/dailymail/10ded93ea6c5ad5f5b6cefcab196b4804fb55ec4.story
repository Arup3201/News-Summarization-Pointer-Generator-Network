NBC will reportedly pay Jay Leno $15 million as he steps down as host of The Tonight Show months ahead of the end of his contract.

The payout is part of Leno's deal to leave the show - which he has hosted for 22 years - before his contract expires in September 2014, making way for Jimmy Fallon as the new host.

But a source told the New York Daily News that the payoff - which equates to Leno's annual salary on the show - is peanuts for the comedian, who makes the biggest bucks for standup in Las Vegas.

As the shake-up was confirmed after weeks of speculation, Leno told Fallon he was 'counting on' him to keep network ratings high.

Smooth transition: NBC executives hoped for the best possible timing of the move, picking after the Winter Olympics which give them their largest audience to hype Fallon

Heading out: Leno will receive a $15 million payoff to leave the show before his contract is up

In his opening monologue of Wednesday's 
show Leno said: ‘I just have one request of Jimmy. We've all fought, 
kicked and scratched to get this network up to fifth place, okay?

'Now we have to keep it there. Jimmy don't let it slip into sixth. We're counting on you.’

The replacement move, which had been 
anticipated for weeks, was announced yesterday and will officially take place following the 
network's broadcast of the Winter Olympics.

Fallon 
will more than double his multi-million dollar salary when he takes over
 from outgoing host Jay Leno next year on the top-rated NBC show.

Industry insiders predict that Fallon
 will see the $5million he gets for fronting 'The Late Show' boosted to 
$12 million when he goes head-to-head with CBS' David Letterman and 
ABC's Jimmy Kimmel in February.

Although Fallon's pay packet will be three million less than the $15million Leno takes home, it still represents a massive show of faith in Fallon, who 
has been working late night television for less than five years. 

Bitter? Jay Leno kept up the assault on NBC execs in his show last night after numerous monologues making fun of bosses

The
 62-year-old Leno - who was temporarily removed from the show in 2009 in
 favor of Conan O'Brien - had made repeated jokes about his bosses and 
the network in recent weeks while rumors swirled over the latest move. 

But
 he and Fallon, 38, presented a united front while announcing the news. 
They recently made a parody video set to a tune from West Side Story 
that lampooned their situation.

'The main difference between this and
 the other time is I’m part of the process. The last time the decision 
was made without me. I came into work one day and — you’re out,' Leno 
said, comparing his previous ouster and now.

'This time around there really aren’t any complications like there were the last time,' he added, according to the New York Times. 'This time it feels right.'

Leno also said in a press release: 
'Congratulations Jimmy. I hope you're as lucky as me and hold on to the 
job until you're the old guy. If you need me, I'll be at the garage.'

Laughing his way to the bank: Leno has been on an anti-NBC joke offensive since reports emerged saying Fallon, pictured, would be replacing him at Tonight

Fallon, whose Late Night show began at 12:35am, added: 'I’m really excited to host a show that starts today instead of tomorrow.'

'I have nothing but respect for Jay,' Fallon said. 'If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t have a show to be taking over.'

The show will be relocated from Los Angeles to New York, where the program started in 1954 when Steve Allen was its host.

Leno - aside from the brief interruption when O'Brien hosted the program - has been the show's presenter since 1992.

He has routinely been tops in the ratings, even as NBC's primetime and daytime programming has fallen off.

In
 competition? Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon have been the mainstay of NBC's 
late night schedule for the past three years with reports now saying 
Fallon will take over Tonight

'I’m glad I've kept it No. 1,' Leno 
said. 'When I started people said, "Oh the only reason you’re winning is
 because of ‘ER," or "The only reason you’re winning is because Hugh 
Grant came on and said that one thing." Well, at least now I can say the
 only reason we’re winning is cause we’re winning.'

After leaving, he said he expects to be 'back on the road, being a comedian again.'

'Saturday Night Live' producer Lorne 
Michaels, who also produces 'Late Night', will take over as producer of 
the new 'Tonight Show.'

Fallon's replacement at 12:35 am was not named, although Seth Meyers of SNL is considered a strong candidate.

NBC
 is worried that ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, whose show recently started at the 
11:35 p.m. time slot,  will establish himself as a go-to late night 
performer for a younger generation if the network didn't move swiftly to
 install Fallon.

Next generation?: With Fallon's ascension to the top chair, Seth Myers, right, is considered the favorite to take over the 12:35 a.m. show

Conan O'Brien briefly replaced Leno as host of The Tonight Show in 2009 until NBC executives reversed their decision. He now hosts a show on TBS

Kimmel took to Twitter to jokingly offer his congratulations to his new counterpart.

'Congratulations to my dear, sweet @jimmyfallon - a formidable rival and an incredible lover.'

But 
the move also has the potential to backfire with Leno's fans, who did 
not embrace Conan O'Brien when Leno was temporarily moved to prime time a
 few years ago.

O'Brien held
 onto the job for just eight months before being replaced by his 
predecessor. O'Brien now hosts a show on cable network TBS.

Leno, whose contract expires next year, hasn't always sounded so gracious over Fallon taking over.

He has recently used comedy as a weapon against his network 
bosses - branding a recent ratings boost a 'miracle' and saying that NBC
 is a 'big number two' in his show.

Hit with youth: Jimmy Fallon has proved remarkably popular and executives believe his age and appeal to younger viewers will keep Tonight on top for years to come

'You know what that means? Between 
Easter and Passover, this is truly the season of miracles. We’re number 
two! I’ve been saying for the last week that NBC is a big number two. 
Haven’t I been saying that? Congratulations!'

Leno went on to talk about a report that T-Mobile is reducing its contracts, adding: 'Apparently they got the idea from NBC.'

The routine comes hot on the heels of other cutting remarks against executives at the network.

Leno had also joked about a 'make-nice' meeting he had with bosses the night before.

He said to make amends they had 
offered to send him and his wife on a Carnival cruise - the crippled 
liner that caused passengers to endure five nightmarish days in the Gulf
 of Mexico.

In another wisecrack, Leno cited news
 reports of a Canadian man who had a knife pulled from his back after 
three years, he sniped: 'He must have worked at NBC, too.'

Rising star: Jimmy Fallon is photographed with SNL creator/producer Lorne Michaels. Fallon will be Leno's replacement on Tonight, which will be executive produced by Michaels

In another routine he referred to his bosses as 'snakes.'

'You know the whole 
  legend of St. Patrick right? St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland 
  – and then they came to the United States and became NBC executives.'

The rapid ascent of Fallon and his 
certain promotion is seen by analysts as NBC recognizing the competition
 offered by ABC's popular Jimmy Kimmel.

While Leno's 'Tonight' show still tops
 the ratings, Kimmel moved his show to the earlier time-slot of 11.35pm to directly compete with him and CBS' David Letterman. 

The Times report quoted one senior executive as saying, 'There is no way on earth that this is not going to happen' - a certainty which may explain why Leno isn't holding back the abuse.

'According to several reports, 
scientists say they are getting closer and closer to being able to do 
Jurassic Park-style cloning of extinct species,' Leno, he told his 
audience one night.

'Imagine that. Things that were once 
thought to be extinct could be brought back from the dead. So there’s 
hope for NBC. It could turn around.'
