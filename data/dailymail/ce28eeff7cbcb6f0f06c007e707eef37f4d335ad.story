One moment, the teenager was carrying out his everyday business.

Seconds later he was buried under rubble, another civilian victim of the bitter internal fighting between President Bashar al-Assad's forces and the militant Islamist groups.

Luckily the teenager was alive, if bloodied and bruised, and was rescued from the damaged building in al-Saad, near Deraa, on Sunday.

The building was hit after a Syrian Air Force fighter jet loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad fired missiles on to the town.

It is just one of many battles occurring in Syria: Today, an an Islamist suicide car bomber killed at least 50 Syrian security men in one of the bloodiest single attacks on President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

Syrian state media reported that a suicide bomber had targeted a rural development centre in Sahl al-Ghab in Hama province.

The
 media put the death toll at just two people, but Rami Abdelrahman, the 
head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said: 'A fighter from 
the Nusra Front blew himself up ... At least 50 were killed.

'He drove his car to the centre and then blew himself up. A series of explosions followed.'

Abdelrahman,
 whose monitoring group is based in Britain, said the rural development 
centre was used by Syrian security forces as one of their biggest bases 
in the area.

The state news 
agency SANA said: "A terrorist blew himself up in the centre which 
resulted in a number of casualties. Two citizens were killed and a 
number of them were wounded."

The Nusra Front is an Islamist group made up of militant Salafis, or ultra-orthodox Muslims.

It has claimed responsibility for several suicide bombings in the past.

Mwanwhile,
 Palestinian supporters and opponents of Syria's regime got swept up in 
intense fighting in Damascus today while rival rebel groups clashed over
 control of a border crossing with Turkey, activists said.

The
 rare infighting among the two groups added news dimensions of chaos to 
the civil war and heightened fears that if President Bashar Assad falls,
 the disparate factions battling the regime will turn against each 
other.

The fighting in 
Damascus was some of the worst since July, when rebels took over several
 neighborhoods in the capital in a striking attack.

Within
 days, a regime counterattack pushed the rebels out of Damascus and 
recaptured the areas. Shortly after those battles, rebels moved on 
Syria's largest city, Aleppo, and it has become a major front in the 
civil war since then.

The
 attacks on Syria's two main cities since summer have demonstrated new 
organization and capabilities of rebel forces as well as a determination
 to press their uprising despite the deaths of more than 36,000 people 
in fighting over the last 19 months.

Abdul-Rahman
 said the fighting in Damascus was concentrated in the southern 
neighborhood of Tadamon and the outskirts of the Palestinian refugee 
camp of Yarmouk.

Damascus-based
 activist Abu Qais al-Shami told The Associated Press via Skype that the
 fighting began Sunday night and went on continuously into Monday.

The
 Observatory and al-Shami said regime forces are backed by the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) led by 
Ahmed Jibril, a radical Palestinian leader and staunch supporter of 
President Bashar Assad.

"Tadamon
 is being struck with shells, rockets and heavy machinegun fire," 
al-Shami said. "People are fleeing the area toward safer areas inside 
the Yarmouk camp."

A 
Syrian opposition figure, who asked not to be identified because of the 
sensitivity of the events, said Palestinian fighters who are opposed to 
Assad were fighting alongside the rebels in Damascus.

The
 Observatory had no immediate word on casualties from Monday's fighting 
but said eight people were killed in Yarmouk Sunday night when several 
mortar rounds landed in the camp.

When
 Syria's unrest began last year, the country's half-million Palestinians
 at first struggled to stay on the sidelines. But in recent months, many
 Palestinians started supporting the uprising.

Syrian
 authorities blame the anti-government uprising that began in March last
 year on a foreign conspiracy. They accuse Gulf countries Saudi Arabia 
and Qatar, along with the U.S, other Western countries and Turkey, of 
offering funding and training to the rebels, whom they describe as 
"terrorists."

In the 
central province of Hama, a suicide attacker detonated his car in the 
village of Ziyara causing some deaths, state-run news agency SANA said. 
It added that the blasts occurred outside a state-run development 
agency.

The Britain-based 
activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the suicide 
attacker targeted an army checkpoint and killed at least 50 soldiers and
 pro-government gunmen.

The
 Observatory also reported that an air raid on the northern town of 
Harem killed at least 20 rebels. It said a rebel commander was seriously
 wounded in the raid.

SANA said a bomb went off in the rich Damascus neighborhood of Mazzeh, killing 11 and wounding dozens.

Television footage showed bloodied people in a street as firefighters worked to put down the blaze.

Elsewhere
 in Syria, activists reported air raids, shelling and clashes in the 
northern provinces of Aleppo and Idlib near the Turkish border to Deir 
el-Zour region in the east and Homs in the center.

There
 are dozens of opposition groups and rebel brigades fighting in Syria's 
civil war. Rivalries are common though violent clashes are unusual.

A
 Turkish government official based in the border town of Kilis confirmed
 two Syrian rebel groups were "engaged in a power struggle," fighting 
each other for the control of the Bab el-Salameh border crossing.

The
 official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with government 
rules, said however, that Turkish officials were still trying to 
determine who the two groups were.

Former
 Syrian Prime Minister Riad Hijab, who defected, met with Turkey's 
foreign minister behind closed doors in Ankara to discuss the Syrian 
opposition meeting in Qatar and efforts to restructure the opposition, a
 Turkish Foreign Ministry official said.

The two also discussed the more than 110,000 Syrian refugees in Turkey.
