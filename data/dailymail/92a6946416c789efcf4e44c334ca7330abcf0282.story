West Ham have endured a rollercoaster start to the season and Mauro Zarate and Adrian sampled a bit more of that off the pitch as they enjoyed a day off at Thorpe Park.

Argentine striker Zarate posted pictures of the day out at the theme Park on his Twitter account with Adrian, as well as friends and family.

The duo took advantage of a rare Friday off with no game on the Saturday, as they travel to Hull over the weekend ahead of their Monday night clash on Sky.

Both players have featured prominently for the Hammers so far this season, with Allardyce's side picking up three points from their opening three fixtures.

Zarate, one of a host of summer signings, has already endeared himself to the West Ham faithful as he scored on his debut in a 3-1 win at Crystal Palace on the opening day of he season.

Adrian has been an ever present this season after enduring a stop start first season at Upton Park, but is Allardyce's No 1 keeper this campaign.

The east Londoners travel to the KC Stadium in the hope of overtaking Steve Bruce's side with a win, with the hosts currently a point above the Hammers.
