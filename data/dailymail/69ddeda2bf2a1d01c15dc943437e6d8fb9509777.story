Paulo Henrique Machado has spent his whole life in hospital.

The 45-year-old Brazilian, whose mother died two days after giving birth to him, was struck down by infantile paralysis brought on by polio, leaving him incapable of fending for himself.

He needs constant help with his breathing from an artificial respirator, cannot walk unaided and has left his hospital 'universe' barely more than 50 times.

But despite his debilitating condition, Paulo has trained as a computer animator and is making a film about his life, based on a story by his best friend, confidante and roommate, Eliana Zagui, who also suffered polio as a child and has lived in the Sao Paulo's Clinicas ever since.

'Some people think we are like husband and wife, but we are more like brother and sister,' Paolo told the BBC. 'Every day, when I wake up I have the 
certainty that my strength is over there - Eliana. And it's 
reciprocated. I trust her and she trusts me.'

The pair were among 11 children admitted to the hospital with polio - an all-but-wiped-out but highly-infectious viral disease that affects under fives - in the 1970s.

Happy together: Doctors never understood why Paulo and 
Eliana outlived the others, but they say the experience, while very sad,
has brought them closer together

Forced to live in what was called a 
'torpedo' - effectively a body-encasing iron lung - during his early 
years, he was forced to create his own 'universe' inside the confines of his hospital prison.

His earliest memories are of 'exploring' the corridors of each ward in his wheelchair, wandering into the rooms of other children, his only toy being his imagination.

Polio is a crippling
and sometimes fatal virus that has been all but wiped out in the developed world.

A highly-infectious disease, polio attacks the nervous system and can lead to paralysis, disability and even death.

But thanks to a vaccine programme in the Sixties, polio has been eradicated, though it remains a problem in Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

But 80 per cent of survivors later experience post-polio syndrome, though doctors don't know why.

The symptoms - pain and weakness, fatigue and muscle loss - can strike any time from 15 to 50 years after the initial disease.

One of the major breakthroughs was the invention of the iron lung, a body-encasing machine that fills lungs with 
air by making the chest rise (pictured).

Before its invention, children with polio died frequently.

But, with an average life expectancy of just ten years, Paulo and Eliana watched all their friends die, one by one.

Doctors never understood why Paulo and Eliana outlived the others, but they say the experience, while sad, has brought them closer together.

'It was difficult,' says Machado. 'Each loss was like a dismembering,
you know, physical… like a mutilation. Now, there's just two
of us left - me and Eliana.'

The risk of infection is high for Paulo and Eliana, so they rarely travel outside of the hospital.

But advancing technology has allows them increasing freedom to see parts of the world that ordinary people may take for granted.

They have, however, made the odd trip outside; their most memorable outing was to the beach in the 1990s.

'There are some [trips] which stand out, like seeing the beach for 
the first time when I was 32,' he says.

'I opened the car door and saw the sea and
thought 'Wow! What is this?'

Eliana,
who says she had built an image of the sea based on films, pictures and
postcards that she had seen, adds: 'They took us out of the vehicles, Paulo was in a 
wheelchair and they pushed my bed onto the sand.

'You enjoy these little moments, that many people take for granted. They don't stop to marvel like we do.'

Because they have lived at the hospital for so long, they are allowed to decorate their room in whatever way they chose. While they say it often brings out a friendly argument, they have agreed to split the room down the middle.

Paulo's side is filled with film memorabilia, while Eliana's side is full of books and dolls.

Neither have attended 'school' in the way other children do. But that hasn't stopped them gaining an education.

years, he created his own world inside the hospital with his friends.

Inner strength: The risk of infection is high for Paulo and Eliana, so they rarely travel outside of the hospital

Indeed, Eliana is a published author and spends her time either writing or painting using her mouth.

Paulo
is using his computer animation skills, combined with Eliana's 
storytelling, to make a 3-D animated film called The Adventures of Leca 
and her Friends.

And in May this year, he managed to raise the £45,000 he needed through an online campaign to realise his dream and begin making the stop-animation film.

He says it follows Leca, which is also Eliana's nickname, playing 'all the mischievous games kids get up to'.

He says his characters are realistic because 'they come from someone who is disabled'.

he added: 'I know [exactly] what the difficulties they face are.'
