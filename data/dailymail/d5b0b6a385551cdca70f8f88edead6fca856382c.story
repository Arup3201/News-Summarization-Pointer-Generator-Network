Julie Beattie, 24, was on fire when her sister Lucie arrived at the south London home, the Old Bailey heard. Julie's 49-year-old lover Ashley Williams allegedly doused her in petrol and set her alight

A young mother burned to death after telling her older lover she was leaving to be with his 18-year-old son.

Julie Beattie, 24, was allegedly doused in petrol, set alight and hit over the head with a hammer by father-of-twelve Ashley Williams, 49, as she tried to run off with Ashley Williams Jnr.

Sobbing in the witness box, her sister Lucie Beattie described arriving at their south London home to see groundsman Mr Williams put on his coat and walk out as Miss Beattie burned, screaming, behind him.

She told the Old Bailey: ‘I pushed open the kitchen door and a lot of smoke came out.

‘I saw Julie. She was in flames.'

At that point she fell to her knees in the witness box, as relatives and court officials sobbed in the gallery.

Resuming evidence, Miss Beattie added: ‘I was scared to touch her.

‘I saw Ashley go back inside the house.

‘He put a jacket on and walked off, while Julie was on fire.

‘When
 Julie was following me out of the house, the children were there and 
they were screaming, so I took the children and I took them to the other
 side of the car-park.

‘She kept saying: "Hurry, call the ambulance".

‘She kept saying she is hot and needs a drink and I didn’t know what to do.

‘Everyone was shouting at me not to put water on her and I didn’t know what to do.

‘I was so scared.’

The victim had suffered 90 per cent burns and died in hospital.

The court has heard Mr Williams, who denies murder, had fathered four children with the victim, who first became pregnant by him when she was just 16.

Her sister said the victim wanted to ‘wear vest tops, have a tattoo and have fun’ but Mr Williams would not let her.

Affair: The court heard Miss Beattie had been seeing her partner's son, Ashley Williams Jnr (pictured), 18

She was packing her bags to run off with Williams Jnr when her partner, a father-of-12, stopped her

She began an affair with his son, Ashley Jnr, who is now 18, and spent time with him in Birmingham.

Mr Williams begged her to stay but she refused and said he was ‘fake', the court heard.

Lucie, who was staying at their Walworth home, claims she arrived to find smoke billowing out of a window and ran in screaming: 'Where's Julie.'

Mr Williams answered the door and told her to ‘come back in a minute,' she said.

‘Then Julie started screaming.

‘She said: “Please help me, call the police, he’s going to kill us. He’s got a hammer."'

The Old Bailey paused proceedings when Lucie Beattie fell to her knees in tears in the witness box

‘Ashley kept saying “Go for a walk, its OK.”

‘Julie was trying to get out the house and he wouldn’t let her out.’

Lucie headed to the police station but turned back when she called the home and nobody picked up.

'Something made me go back,’ she told the court.

‘Julie had been screaming all that time and when I called Ashley it was silent. I turned round and I went back to the house.’

Mr Williams, who was also set on fire in the incident allegedly tried to slit his own wrists after the incident and told police he killed his partner ‘for a dare.’

He denies murder.

The trial continues.
