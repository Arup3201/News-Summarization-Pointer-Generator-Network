Paul Luker mowed down and killed a senior RAF officer

A delivery driver who mowed down and killed a senior RAF officer as he cycled home was today spared jail.

Paul Luker, 51, claimed he was 'blinded by the sun' when he hit Group Captain Tom Barrett, the 44-year-old Station Commander of RAF Northolt.

Gp Capt Barrett, who leaves behind two daughters,  served as an aide to the Queen, as well as in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan as a jet pilot. He had also been awarded an OBE.

Described as an 'avid cyclist', he often used the journey from the base in Ruislip, west London, to his home in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, as a training exercise.

He had travelled less than a mile when he was hit by Luker's transit van at 5.07pm on March 10 last year on the A40.

Luker was found guilty of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving following a trial at Harrow Crown Court.

Sentencing
 Luker to a 12-month community order and 100 hours unpaid work, Judge 
John Anderson said: 'The consequences of your driving were terrible on 
Gp Capt Barrett's wife and family, to whom once again I pass on my 
deepest sympathies.

'But I'm
 quite satisfied this offence arose out of your momentary inattention 
and as such, it is an offence that falls into the lowest category of the
 sentencing guidelines for death by careless driving.

'I'm satisfied of the deep remorse you
 have shown for the victim, his family and colleagues, and that this has
 had, and continues to have, a profound effect on your mental wellbeing.

'I take the view that a community order would be the correct sentence in your case.'

Fellow motorists told of a 'loud bang' and a 'twisted wheel' flying through the air after the crash.

The impact of the collision caused Gp Capt Barrett to be thrown of his bicycle and land on the roadside.

He was rushed to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington but died of multiple injuries.

In a victim impact statement, Gp Capt Barrett's father, Anthony, said: 'Tom's death has turned our lives completely upside down and his loss has caused the greatest distress to my wife Christine and I, his sister, Lisa, his wife, Sophie, and his two daughters, Emily, 11 and Alice, 10.

'We are a very close family and he was the driving force of all of us.

'His sudden death is an incalculable loss to all of us. Sophie has lost a husband and best friend.

'The girls have lost a devoted father who they adored. A very special light has gone out and can never be rekindled.'

Mrs Sophie Barrett described her husband as 'her soul mate', adding: 'The girls have lost a loving father who was an enormous influence on them.'

Luker - who was driving at 50mph, under the speed limit - wept giving evidence, as he told how he simply could not understand why he did not see Gp Capt Barrett.

The self-employed delivery driver told how the crash had left him needing counselling and had stripped him of his happy-go-lucky personality.

Luker, who has been driving since 1984, said the sun had been 'quite low' as he drove on the Greenford flyover.

'I was very short-sighted, I was struggling to see the brake lights of the car in front of me, so I decided I needed to slow down.

'At that point I was in the middle lane and the sun got worse, so I put a cap on but it didn't help much.

'The sun was as low that day as I have ever known.

'The only way I could get the sun out of my eyes was to put the sun visor fully down, but I would have been blinded by that, so I put it on an angle.

'I could see people flashing me for going too slow so I decided to go into the inside lane and remember looking in my mirror for motorcycles.

'All of a sudden I felt a bump.'

Luker added: 'I immediately slowed down and decided not to do an emergency brake because the car behind me was too close and stopping suddenly might have caused an accident, so I geared down.

'I thought I hit a deer. I never saw anything.

'I saw the bicycle wheels along the road and then I realised I hit a cyclist.

'I remember shouting "oh no, oh no," - I was in some sort of shock.

'Mr Barrett was lying face down and I saw blood coming out of his ear and mouth and I knew at that stage it was quite a problem.

'I just don't understand why I didn't see him,' he said.

'I would have done everything in my power to avoid any accident.

'I think about it all the time. I was a pretty happy go lucky sort of fellow until that day.'

Luker, of Beaconsfield Road, Farnham Royal, Bucks, was also banned from the road for a year and must complete an extended test before he can drive again.

Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and blue striped tie, he wept as he hugged family and friends after being released from the dock.

Speaking outside court, he said: 'I agree with the sentence and I'm going to do it.'

Luker, who is suffering from financial difficulties, was not ordered to pay any costs after Judge Anderson ruled he did not want to 'heap further misery upon misery'.
