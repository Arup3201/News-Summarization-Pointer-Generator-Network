Unflappable: Sir Rex Hunt in ceremonial dress

The puckish figure was ebullient. ‘Come in, come in — forgive the awful state of the place, we’ve had visitors, you know.’

It was just a few days after the end of the Falklands War, in June 1982, and Sir Rex Hunt, the islands’ governor, was still very much in character.

I was among his first visitors to Government House in Port Stanley following his return to the islands.

Some ten weeks earlier, it had been taken over by the Argentine army and the furniture was still largely in disarray.

Anti-blast tape still criss-crossed the windows of the low, white stone house, which was built for governors in 1845. But — crucially — the Queen’s portrait (removed to a safe-house as the attack was beginning) was back on the wall, and Sir Rex ushered in his visitors with relish.

It was not hard to see how this tiny figure,  barely 5ft 4in tall, had brazenly stood up to the heavily-armed invaders.

True, he had added almost two feet to his height by first putting on his ceremonial plumed hat to face them.

Among the list of famous quotations drawn from wars down the years, the words of Sir Rex, who has just died at the age of 86, will surely always raise a smile of pride among students of that brief war.

Sir Rex ignored the outstretched hand of the new — and very temporary — Argentine governor, General Garcia, who admonished him, saying: ‘It is very ungentlemanly of you to refuse to shake my hand.’

Sir Rex replied in his sharp, staccato voice: ‘It is very uncivilised of you to invade my country.’

For the truth is that war was the very last thing Rex Hunt and his wife Mavis had expected when, in 1980, he became governor of the Falkands in what he knew was probably his last posting in the Colonial and Diplomatic Service.

Born in Redcar, Yorkshire, in June 1926, he had been a Spitfire pilot in the RAF for several years before joining the Overseas Civil Service in 1951.

He served in half-a-dozen places, including Uganda, where they were frequently without electricity and running water, let alone drainage, and South Vietnam, where he was the last British official to leave the British embassy in Saigon, handing the dangling set of keys to ITN reporter Sandy Gall as the Communist army from the North stormed in.

Sir Rex returned as Governor following the 74-day war and remained in his post until 1985

After this, Sir Rex thought, anywhere else would feel like a holiday. When the Falklands were offered, the Foreign Office said it would be ‘a tranquil but absorbing posting’.

Not so! Two years later, Mavis and their two children, together with domestic staff from Government House, were sheltering in friends’ homes in Stanley while battle raged, and her portly husband was facing the invaders — incredibly — with a pistol.

Everything that had led to this moment was astonishing, both militarily and diplomatically.

First, the cynical FO had sent him there expecting this comfortable, mature family man to convince the islanders that their best interests would be served if they drifted away from Britain (7,000 miles away) and accepted Argentine sovereignty just across the water.

Successive British governments, anxious to divest themselves of what they knew was potential trouble, had been considering relinquishing the British Dependency since the mid-Sixties. Argentina, of course, had been claiming sovereignty for 150 years.

The Foreign Office saw Hunt as the ideal man, as he put it, ‘to gain the islanders’ confidence and talk them into accepting a lease-back solution with Argentina’.

What happened, instead, was that Sir Rex found himself sympathising with their wish to remain British.

As he wrote in his memoir, My Falkland Days: ‘I had previously determined that if it should ever reach the stage that the FCO instructed me to pursue a policy that I believed to be against the best interests of the Falkland islanders, I should have no alternative but to resign.’

Sir Rex held discussions with the 1,800 islanders who made their feelings very clear: they were British and wanted to stay British.

For his part, Hunt saw it as his moral duty to represent their views to London, not London’s views to them. As long as they wanted to stay British, their rights were the same as any other British people.

Back at the Foreign Office, there was near apoplexy. Hunt had ‘gone native’.

It wasn’t long before the then Tory Defence Secretary, John Nott, was announcing the withdrawal of the British Antarctic survey ship, the Endurance. It was ostensibly part of defence cuts, but the islanders saw it as a first indication of British withdrawal.

Whether or not it really was an invitation to the Argentine navy, as they suspected, on March 19, 1982, a party of Argentine ‘scrap metal merchants’ landed on South Georgia, a tiny British island 800 miles east of the Falklands, and hoisted an Argentine flag.

Rex was not only governor, he was also commander-in-chief of the Falklands, so he ordered a unit of Marines to remove them.

To his astonishment, this was countermanded in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington.

On March 31, the Foreign Office learned that an Argentine fleet had set sail for the Falkland Islands with orders to seize them.

The U.S. was immediately informed, and Britain’s ambassador to the United Nations was told — but it was 24 hours before the FO passed this information to our man in Port Stanley.

When it did finally arrive, this terrible news of an impending invasion was couched in words that read as though they had been dictated behind a yawn: ‘We have apparently reliable evidence that an Argentine task force will gather off Cape Pembroke early tomorrow morning, April 2. You will wish to make your dispositions accordingly.’

Dispositions with what? Rex Hunt had just 68 Marines.

Desperately, he asked London for instructions. London’s hand-washing reply left him feeling very alone: ‘When you tell the islanders is up to your own judgment. When you arrest the Argentines is also up to you.

‘But we would advise you that although it seems very likely that an invasion will take place, there are still negotiations going on, and even at this late moment, an invasion might be avoided.

‘Your action in rounding up the Argentines might precipitate the very action we wish to avoid.’

But that is precisely what the plucky Sir Rex did, or at least indicated, with an order to his military force to ‘arrest’ the Argentines. It was a case of No Surrender.

Battle began two hours later with heavy fire on Government House. Having only a small defensive force, he had to consider surrender, if only to prevent loss of life, but he quickly rejected the idea.

Bit by bit, the Argentine forces pushed to within 20 yards of the house. But Sir Rex refused to leave his study, sitting at his desk brandishing his Italian-made pistol, resolving to shoot any Argentines who dared burst through his door.

Eventually, with his free hand, he picked up the phone to an Argentine air force senior officer, persuading him to come to Government House for talks under the protection of a white flag

The officer came (cowering on the ground as his own confused troops mistakenly shot at him) and eventually, with a white sheet draped over Hunt’s own umbrella, the officer and the Falklands’ chief secretary walked together to the town hall to arrange a truce, enabling the wounded to be taken to hospital.

At this point, Sir Rex put down his pistol and ordered the Marines to lay down their weapons.

To the Argentines, however, this appeared as a signal of defeat. Within hours, the Argentine soldiers were strutting into Stanley and lounging all over Government House — including the governor’s study.

With Rex Hunt expelled from the island and flown to Uruguay, the Argentines thought they had reclaimed the Falklands.

Fortunately for the islanders, though, back in London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had very different ideas from her own Foreign Office — and before long was ordering the assembly of a Task Force.

Some ten weeks later, Sir Rex was returning to the Falklands in triumph. When, three years later, he retired from the governorship just before his 60th birthday, many islanders wept. He was more than their governor, he was their saviour.

In recent years, he and his wife lived in Stockton-on-Tees where he played a little golf, had intermittent gout, gave talks about his time in the Falklands and was chairman of the Falkland Islands Association.

He never tired of talking about the Falklands or its people.

‘They’re great British people,’ he declared that cold morning in 1982 soon after the war’s end, as he showed us into Government House and opened a bottle of wine. ‘Who would want to be anything else?’
