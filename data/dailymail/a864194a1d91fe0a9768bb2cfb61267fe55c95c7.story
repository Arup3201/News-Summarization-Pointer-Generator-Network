If Prince Harry wasn't sure what he has let himself in for, he knows now.

He emerged blowing his hands yesterday from 24 hours in a giant freezer to simulate the conditions he will face trekking to the South Pole.

Harry, 29, and a group of British servicemen and women with amputated limbs will take on teams from the US and Commonwealth in a charity race to the Pole over 15 days in November and December.

The group practised putting up tents and using cross trainers inside British engineering design specialists MIRA's whole-vehicle environmental test chambers

The walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge will see them travel 208 miles across the Antarctic in temperatures as low as -50C pulling 11stone sledges.

The group were subjected to -55C at engineering design specialist MIRA's training base in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

They practiced putting up tents without getting frostbite and skied on cross-trainers for 12 hours, two hours at a time with ten-minute breaks.

Exiting the cold chamber, Harry joked that the worst part had been 'going in'.

They had to ski for up to two hours at a time before taking a brief 10 minutes and then repeating it again all over again

During
their training, the team were subjected to ambient temperatures of 
minus 35C, with wind speeds of 45mph - which caused the thermometer to 
plummet to minus 55C.

Dressed
in his cold weather gear, Harry had to practice putting up his tent, 
eating, sleeping - and even going to the toilet – all while learning how
to avoid frost-bite in the inhospitable Antarctic climate.

The
team members were also given a cross trainer each in order to recreate 
the sheer physical exertion they will face pulling their pulks across 
the barred Antarctic landscape.

This involved them ski-ing for two hours at a time, with a break for ten minutes, over and over again for 12 hours solid.

Then it was time for a quick cup of coffee and a chocolate biscuit, before heading back off to work.

The
British team are fundraising for the Walking With The Wounded charity, 
of which the prince is patron, which raises money to re-train service 
personnel who are wounded, injured or sick, and assisting them to find a
career outside the military.  

Harry
was determined to join the expedition after missing out on an attempt 
to conquer Mount Everest with the group last year because of his 
military commitments.

He was also forced to withdraw early from a 
successful North Pole expedition to attend his brother's wedding in 
2011.

The royal shared a 
tent on Monday night with Captain Ibrar Ali, 36, who lost his right arm 
in a roadside bomb blast in 2007, and Major Kate Philp, who chose to 
have her left leg amputated after her Warrior armoured vehicle struck an
IED (improvised explosive device) in Musa Qala in Helmand Province in 
2008.

The Prince, who is a patron of the Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge, will take part in a 24 hour Cold Chamber Training Exercise with the British Team

Maj Philp, from Knightwick in Worcestershire, said Harry was a ‘good extra pair of hands’ during the training exercise.

The
35-year-old Royal Artillery officer added: ‘He's experienced at this, 
having spent some time at the North Pole. He knows what he's doing. He's
got his military training, and it's very, very easy, so he's a good 
extra pair of hands.’

Oxford graduate Maj Philp, who still serves with 3 UK Division in Bulford, Wiltshire, said the team was bonding well.

‘The
reality is definitely dawning now, and certainly having experienced 
what we've just experienced here at Mira [training facility] it's really
put it into sharp focus for us,’ she said.

Prince Harry has joked he 'will have a brew ready' at the Pole for the other teams taking part in the race

On November 16 the team will fly to Cape Town, South Africa, before flying to Novo, Antarctica, where they will spend a few days checking kit and acclimatising before being flown to begin the race

Test: The team had to work together to set up camp - just like they will have to in the South Pole

Training venue: British engineering design specialists MIRA's whole-vehicle environmental test chambers in Nuneaton, Warwicks, where the teammates attempted constructing their tents in conditions similar to the South Pole

Prince Harry formed part of the Walking with the Wounded expedition team in 2011. He is pictured testing an immersion suit on the island of Spitsbergen, in preparation for their walk to the North Pole
