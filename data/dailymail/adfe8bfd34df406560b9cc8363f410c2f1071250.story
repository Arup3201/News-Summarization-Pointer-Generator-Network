The owner of Arsenal Football Club has bought the ultimate field of dreams - an £80million farm.

With Arsenal in tenth place in the Premiership after a disastrous run of results, plenty of fans have called for Gunners boss Arsene Wenger to stand down.

Now billionaire businessman Stan Kroenke has found an ideal location for Wenger to be 'put out to pasture' - this 124,000 acre ranch in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, USA.

The 65-year-old, who owns 66 per cent of Arsenal, agreed an undisclosed figure for the ranch last week - which was being marketed for $132 million (£80m).

Covering the equivalent of 71,000 Arsenal pitches, the Broken O Ranch runs 3,500 mother cows, 800 replacement heifers and 175 range bulls.

Such is the vastness of Broken O that the UK's second largest city, Birmingham, at 103 square miles or 66,174 hectares, would virtually fit into it twice.

Situated along the eastern edge of the stunning Rocky Mountain Front - the Broken O Ranch is regarded as one of the US's most grand and significant ranches.

It was owned by the Moore family who spent around 25 years building it up and includes more than 20 miles of the Sun River coursing through it.

The Sun River corridor provides exceptional brown and rainbow trout fishing, antelope, whitetail and mule deer hunting, as well as extensive upland game bird and waterfowl populations.

Each year the ranch produces 25,000 tons of alfalfa hay and 700,000 bushels of small-grain crops.

Denver-based Kroenke, who is worth £2.5 billion, is now thought to be the eighth largest landowner in the USA following his latest purchase - owning an estimated 864,000 acres.

Real estate company Hall and Hall managed the sale for Mr Kroenke, who also owns a number of US sports franchises.

Location: Broken O Ranch spans Lewis & Clark, Cascade and Teton counties and is 45 miles west of Great Falls and east of the stunning Rocky Mountains

Legacy: Mr Kroenke is said to be looking forward to building on the work done by previous owners in making Broken O one of the most significant farming ranches in the US

Sam Connolly, general manager of Kroenke Ranches, said: 'Bill Moore obviously had the vision, expertise and wherewithal to assemble one of the finest cattle and farming operations in the United States.

'Mr Kroenke looks forward to building on that incredible legacy.'

A statement from the Moore family added: 'We are pleased that the Broken O will be in the hands of a new owner of Stan Kroenke's calibre and commitment to agriculture."

A posting in response to the story on a Montana news website read: 'Just boggles my mind that there are those of us that work so hard for what little we have and then there are those that could spend $132.2 million. No complaints, mind you...God is Good... my family is healthy and happy. Just can't wrap my brain around this. Blessings!'
