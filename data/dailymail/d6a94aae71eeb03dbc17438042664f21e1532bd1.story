An eight-year-old schoolboy has described his lucky escape after he become impaled on an iron railing which went through his thigh.

Lewis Todd, from Worsley, Salford, was climbing over a metal gate while playing with friends at a christening when he slipped and fell.

A metal rod pierced his leg at the top of his thigh leaving him stranded in mid-air.

His mother Kelly and friends rushed to help and were forced to take his weight by holding him as firefighters raced to the scene.

Crew manager Mike O'Neil described how he and his team had to cut Lewis free from the railing but part of its was still inside his leg as he was rushed to hospital.

Lewis, a pupil at Grosvenor Road Primary School in Swinton, needed emergency surgery and spent four days being treated.

But luckily, the spike missed vital arteries and muscles and he has gone on to make a full recovery.

Lewis, who has kept a five-inch piece of the railing as a souvenir, said: 'I was playing with my brother and I
slipped climbing over the gate and the pole went through my leg. It 
didn’t hurt that much and the firefighters were kind to me and cut the 
pole free. I wasn’t scared.'

Louis has even been able to start playing rugby and swim again. He recently visited Agecroft Fire Station to meet the firefighters who rescued him.

White Watch crew manager Mike O’Neill said: 'It was lovely to meet Lewis again in better circumstances.

'I have to say he was really very brave as we worked around him to cut him free - he was very calm, because I think he was in shock. We had to saw the railing from around him and he got into the ambulance with part of it still inside his thigh, so it’s been smashing to see him much better.'

Mother Kelly, 32, an accounts worker from, Swinton, said they had only been at the christening for 15 minutes when the accident happened.

She said: 'He’s been very lucky as it could have been far worse.

'Lewis really wanted to thank the firefighters and I can’t thank them enough.

'He’s back playing rugby now and because he had the metal pole in his leg and he was so brave, all his friends and family now call him Ironman.'
