Shameless celebrity publicist Max Clifford said tonight he was 'incredibly disappointed' after a jury found him guilty of a string of indecent assaults.

And the 71-year-old refused to apologise to his victims as he spoke briefly outside his Surrey home.

Clifford was charged with 11 counts of indecent assault, and found guilty on Monday of eight. He was
 cleared on two other counts, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on 
another.

He is due to be sentenced by a judge at Southwark Crown Court on Friday.

Getaway: When asked what he thought would happen at the sentencing hearing he simply responded 'cheers', and drove away

Clifford had been warned by his lawyers not to speak to reporters gathered outside his mansion when he returned home today.

However, after entering the house he came back outside and broke his silence, speaking briefly from inside his silver Audi A3.

'Everybody knows the position and obviously I was incredibly disappointed with what's happened,' he told Channel 4 news this evening.

Clifford said nothing when asked if he would be apologising to his accusers.

'So, back to court on Friday,' he added as he drove past, dressed in dark jeans and a striped shirt.

When asked what he thought would happen at the sentencing hearing he simply responded 'cheers', and drove away.

Clifford 
was known as a confidante of the stars and counted on by many 
celebrities to manage their careers during times of crisis. He 
represented TV mogul Simon Cowell and advised countless others on public
 relations strategy and damage control.

Dropped: Earlier today it was reported that Mr Cowell had ditched Clifford as his PR advisor following the guilty verdicts

Earlier
 today it was reported that Mr Cowell had ditched Clifford as his PR 
advisor, following the guilty verdicts after the pair had worked 
together for a decade.

A
 source told the Sun that Cowell was 'horrified' by what the court heard
 during Clifford's three-week trial and is now 'distancing' himself from
 his former PR man.

Despite
 the split, Clifford's company, Max Clifford Associates, was still using
 a picture of Cowell on its website this morning before the whole site 
was taken down around midday.

During
 the trial, Southwark Crown Court heard that Clifford had lured young 
girls into sex by offering them acting roles, including in the hit TV 
soap opera 'Dynasty.'

One of the schoolgirls he molested told the Daily Mail: ‘It took 
me and other victims many years to pluck up the courage to seek justice.

'We
 were young innocent victims of a powerful, manipulative and dishonest 
man whom, over the years, we saw become crowned king of the 
kiss-and-tell industry.’

Sources
 close to Clifford, who spent £250,000 on his defence, said he had been 
urged by close associates several months ago to plead guilty.

But he had
 insisted on fighting the charges, convinced he might go free.

Clifford, who in 2010 accepted a settlement reported to be over £1million from the News of the World after his phone was hacked, could now be pursued for compensation by his victims.

Clifford
 is the first celebrity to be convicted under Operation Yewtree, the 
£2.7million Scotland Yard investigation sparked by the death of Jimmy 
Savile.

The
 guilty verdicts will be seen as at least partial vindication of the 
Crown Prosecution Service in its controversial pursuit of 1970s 
celebrities, following a string of recent acquittals.

Clifford
 was branded a grade-A paedophile and ‘every little girl’s worst 
nightmare’ during his eight-week trial at London’s Southwark Crown 
Court.

The PR 
agent, who turned 71 during the case, sat emotionless in the dock 
wearing an open-necked shirt as the verdicts were given.

His
 disabled 42-year-old daughter Louise also showed no emotion in the 
public gallery – she had given evidence in his defence, but prosecutors 
said she was tainted by her blind loyalty to her father.

Freed
 on bail, outside court Clifford was asked repeatedly if he would say 
‘sorry’ to his victims. He smiled awkwardly but said, 
uncharacteristically, that his lawyers had told him ‘to say nothing at 
all’.

Clifford
 had denied all the allegations and called his victims ‘mentally 
disturbed’ fantasists hunting compensation. Their accusations were ‘a 
fairy story that only you believe,’ he had snapped to the prosecutor.

Younger days: During the trial, Clifford admitted attending sex parties in his youth

But
 after nine days of deliberations, the jury of six men and four women 
believed the women, finding Clifford guilty of eight counts of indecent 
assault: Four against a 15-year-old in 1977, one on a 19-year-old in 
1981 or 1982, two against a 17-year-old in 1982 or 1983, and one on an 
18-year-old in the early 1980s.

He
 was cleared of another two allegations – one 18-year-old who said she 
was pushed up against a wall in his central London offices when he 
groped her and kissed her in 1975, and another, aged 19, who claimed she
 was groped in a taxi in 1979.

The
 jury could not reach a verdict on a count involving a woman who claimed
 he groped her in his car after meeting her at a Wimpy bar in South 
London in 1966.

In
 fact, there were 23 alleged victims who came forward to police, but prosecutors
 decided to proceed with what they perceived to be the seven strongest 
cases.

Clifford
 will be sentenced on Friday. The maximum sentence for indecent assault 
was two years at the time the offences were committed.

He was bailed on the condition he spends nights at his £3.5million Surrey mansion.

The judge told him: ‘You must realise that the fact I have given you bail is no indication of what the final sentence will be.’

Last
 night Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, said the
 verdicts ‘provide a long-denied justice to the victims of serious 
sexual offences’.
