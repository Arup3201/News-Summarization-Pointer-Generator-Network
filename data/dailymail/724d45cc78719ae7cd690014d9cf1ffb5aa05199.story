Commons leader William Hague tonight fired a warning at Labour that banning Scottish MPs from voting on English laws ‘cannot now be avoided’.

The former Foreign Secretary, emerging from a summit with Tory MPs at the Prime Minister’s countryside retreat at Chequers, said ‘English votes for English laws’ was ‘something we have to face up to’ in the wake of the Scottish independence referendum.

He said handing more devolved powers to Holyrood had to go hand in hand with less Scottish influence over English laws.

But Mr Hague held out an olive branch to the Labour Party – insisting that it would be prepared to hold talks on the issue in the coming weeks.

He said: ‘We will be open to discussions - of course we will be - with the Labour Party and other parties as well.’

However he stressed that the issue had to be dealt with and that if the Westminster parties - including the Liberal Democrats - could not reach agreement they would have to set out their rival positions at the general election in May.

He said: ‘This issue of fairness for England - as well as for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - I think is one that cannot now be avoided. That is now something we have to face up to.

‘It has been discussed for a very long time. The time has now come to make some decisions about this.’

It came after the London Mayor Boris Johnson said proposals to hand sweeping new powers to Edinburgh  were being introduced at a ‘blisteringly fast’ pace - despite claims by Scottish nationalists that Westminster was 'reneging' on its campaign promises.

But he warned that the ‘basic unfairness’ of allowing Scottish MPs to vote on legislation which does not apply north of the border needed addressing.

He said this ‘can be done while keeping the Union together’, but added: ‘It is just bonkers to say that it can be done overnight.’

Mr Johnson’s remarks come amid growing pressure on Labour to back the Prime Minister’s proposal - announced just hours after last week;s referendum result was confirmed - to ban Scottish MPs from voting on laws which only apply in England. 

Mr Cameron said the 'English votes for English laws' measure should be introduced ‘in tandem’ with handing new powers to Holyrood. 

The PM is holding talks with senior backbenchers at his official country retreat, Chequers, today to win support for his proposal.

But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls this morning refused six times to say whether it was ‘fair’ for Scottish MPs to vote on laws which did not apply in Scotland – and slammed Mr Cameron for using the referendum in Scotland to score political points.

It came after the Labour leader Ed Miliband evaded the question thirteen times.

Mr Balls said he wanted a ‘fairer’ solution to the problem, but said: ‘I think David Cameron is just trying to dupe people with an idea that he’s got some easy, quick political fix which him and William Hague and George Osborne sorted out.

‘You can’t play political games with our constitution. I want fairness, but I’m not going to say there’s an easy and fair solution to the question you’re raising.’

He continued that the Prime Minister was ‘playing fast and loose with the whole of our Union’.

‘I’m not going to say to you I’m going to sign up to a change in a couple of months because David Cameron is in a hole.

‘I do think is possibly the most un-prime ministerial thing I’ve seen David Cameron do in the last few years.’

SNP leader Alex Salmond has jumped on the wrangling over English votes for English laws to accuse Westminster of ‘reneging’ on its pledge to devolve more powers to Scotland.

But Mr Johnson this morning said it was ‘tosh’ that David Cameron was going back on his ‘vow’.

The London Mayor said: ‘It is simply not true that the undertakings have been breached; on the contrary, all political parties are going to huge lengths to be obliging.

‘The “vow” that appears on the front of last week’s Daily Record is actually quite vague. It boils down to “extensive” new powers for the Scottish parliament and government, and an agreement to get to work on the agenda as soon as possible.

‘David Cameron is putting William Hague in charge, and we are promised details by Burns night in January.

‘That strikes me as blisteringly fast, when you consider the gravity of the matters at stake.’

But he said: ‘If we give any more powers to Scottish politicians, then we simply must address the basic unfairness to England; indeed, it should have been addressed years ago, as soon as devolution kicked in.’

He added: ‘It won’t necessarily be easy, but it isn’t beyond the wit of man. It can be done, while keeping the Union together and giving Scotland the “extensive” new powers that have been agreed. It is just bonkers to say that it can be done overnight.’
