Nearly £5billion was wiped off the value of Tesco yesterday after the firm revealed a fall in Christmas sales.

Britain’s biggest and richest retailer said underlying takings fell by 2.3 per cent at the most crucial trading period of the year.

Tesco’s flagship promotion the ‘Big Price Drop’ failed to bring in enough shoppers, while bosses admitted that a decision to cut back on vouchers and meal deals was wrong.

As a result, the supermarket’s Christmas food sales were disappointing.

The news came with a profit warning – the first in living memory – that the retail juggernaut will not see a previously expected 10 per cent increase in earnings.

Slump: The Tesco share price has had 50p wiped from it after the sales figures were announced

The poor festive trading meant Tesco’s share of the Christmas grocery market has dipped below 30 per cent for the first time in six years. It is an embarrassing reverse for a company that has seen decades of growth, becoming the UK’s biggest private sector employer and capturing around £1 in every £3 spent on groceries.

The news sent a shudder through the City where analysts described the figures in grim terms, ranging from ‘deeply underwhelming’ to a ‘nightmare scenario’.

As a result, shares plummeted by 15.9 per cent, which is the firm’s biggest one day fall since 1988 and reduced its market value by just short of £5billion.  Tesco was among a number of household name chains to reveal miserable Christmas sales yesterday, including Argos, Halfords, Mothercare and Thorntons.

Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke admitted it had wrongly pulled back on one-off promotions, such as meal deals and ‘buy one get one free’ offers, as its rivals increased them. The marketing push by competitors helped Sainsbury’s to deliver a 2.1 per cent increase in underlying sales at Christmas, while Morrisons was up by 0.7 per cent.

Mr Clarke said: ‘I’ve got to acknowledge that we backed off on some of our promotion and coupon activity just as everyone upped it.

‘I’m disappointed over Christmas trading in the UK but the promotional impact was so great – we didn’t offer a barrage of coupons and we need to reflect on that.’

Mr Clarke, who took over as Tesco boss from Sir Terry Leahy last year, denied that he had been handed a poisoned chalice, saying: ‘There isn’t a retailer in the UK who inherited a business with so many opportunities to grow around the world.’

Cautious consumers: Despite huge promotions a number of business have seen sales plummet as shoppers hold on to their money

The supermarket raised prices for a few days and were then able to say customers were making big savings.

Many of the items that were reduced were either sold for the same amount they were six weeks before the promotion or have only been cut by a small amount.

Some Tesco prices that did not drop were:

Tesco Value Unsalted Butter - August 23: £1.10; August 30: £1.19; September 26: £1.10

Tesco Value Unsmoked Back Bacon - August 16: £1.44; August 23: £1.57; September 26: £1.44;

Oxo Beef Stock Cubes - 12 pack - August 16: 99p; August 27: £1.07; September 26: 99p;

Loose Carrots - August/September: 70p per kg; One week at 80p; September 26: 56p;

Tesco had pinned its hopes of growth on its ‘Big Price Drop’, which was presented as rescuing customers from the biggest cost of living squeeze in living memory.

Prices would be cut on 3,000 commonly bought items, saving shoppers £500million over a full year.

But customers, who have continued to see an increase in the cost of the weekly shop, have not been convinced.

Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said the trading update was ‘something of a profits warning for the year’.

Retail analyst Philip Dorgan, of Panmure Gordon, said: ‘This is the nightmare scenario. If [Tesco’s] UK profits keep falling, then it will not be able to invest so much overseas, so long-term growth will slow and returns will significantly undershoot targets.’

But Tarlok Teji, retail analyst at Manchester Business School, said it would be wrong to believe Tesco will not bounce back.

In a significant change in policy, Tesco said it plans to open fewer hypermarkets in the UK and to devote more cash to expanding its online business and small outlets.Tesco’s fall of 2.3 per cent in sales covered the six weeks to January 7.

The weak performance was driven by food sales rather than general merchandise, clothing and electricals, which saw growth overall.

Online sales grew more than 14 per cent. At the same time, total international sales rose by 8.2 per cent, despite problems in the U.S. where it is to close 12 of its Fresh’n’Easy outlets.

To the chagrin of its boss Phil Clarke, Tesco’s Big Price Drop did not happen in the supermarket, but on the stock market.

Tesco
has been the uncontested champion of food retailing in Britain for 
almost two decades. Its tills continued to ring, and its profits 
continued to flow, throughout the financial crisis and the recession.

So
City traders were simply dumbfounded when the company confessed to a 
downturn in UK sales over the vital Christmas period and warned that 
profit growth is slowing.

It’s
safe to say that having getting on for £5billion wiped off the value of
the company was not the kind of discounting Phil Clarke had in mind 
when he launched a promotion aimed at austerity Britain last autumn.

Not so sweet Christmas: Thorntons the chocolatier also had disappointing sales during the festive season

But his Big Price Drop campaign, which cut the cost of everyday goods across the board, was outgunned by more sophisticated marketing moves by rivals such as Sainsbury and Morrisons.Tesco was left in the unfamiliar position of trailing its competitors. The share price fall may have felt cataclysmic, but the company is hardly on its knees.

Around £1 in every £3 spent on groceries in Britain goes into one of its tills and it’s also the UK’s biggest non-food retailer, thanks to its sales of clothing, books, toys, electrical items and home products.

International expansion means a large chunk of Tesco sales is now made overseas, in locations including Hungary and Thailand.

So a 2.3 per cent fall in underlying sales in just one part of the empire, the bricks-and-mortar stores in Britain, doesn’t sound like a catastrophic failure.

But the British supermarkets are still the group’s beating heart – and until recently, this kind of lapse by Tesco would have been unthinkable.

Under the 15-year stewardship of Sir Terry Leahy, who stepped down in March last year, Tesco was a relentless profit-making machine that appeared incapable of slipping into reverse gear.

Only time will tell whether Phil Clarke (left)
can put Tesco back on top – or whether Sir Terry Leahy (right) should have gone 
shopping somewhere else for his successor

Before he hung up his grocer’s apron, Leahy had more than tripled Tesco’s operating profits to £3.5billion, by moving the business light years away from the ‘pile ’em high, sell ’em cheap’ philosophy of Tesco’s market-trader founder, Sir Jack Cohen.

In the process, he not only transformed 
Tesco, but the entire supermarket sector. In place of the depressing, fluorescent strip-lit aisles of yesteryear, he introduced sleek 
out-of-town superstores and small convenience outlets in urban centres.

With its Clubcard, Tesco was a 
pioneer of loyalty points and its ‘Finest’ range of upmarket food lured 
gourmet shoppers who in the past had spurned its shelves.

The
obvious question, then, is whether Tesco’s fall from grace is Phil 
Clarke’s fault – or whether his apparently golden inheritance was 
flawed.

Critics in the 
City have fretted for some time that the group’s ambitious foreign 
growth plans – led by Clarke before he took over as group chief 
executive in March – could lead to under-investment in the core UK 
business. Clarke is now committed to investing more in the British 
stores.

Others doubted
that the new man could ever hope to emulate Leahy, who by the time of 
his retirement had become a legend in retail circles. Leahy himself 
handpicked Clarke to succeed him.

Weak christmas sales at Tesco were caused by dropping food sales

Both are down-to-earth Liverpudlians who worked their way up to the boardroom from the shop floor.

They even live on the same street in a Hertfordshire village near Cheshunt, where Tesco has its HQ.

Those who have accused Tesco of destroying high streets with its suburban superstores and of driving independent village shops into extinction will no doubt rejoice at the thought its empire-building days may be coming to an end.

No business, however great its record, has a divine right to success. Virtually all companies in the end fall foul of smarter competition, or their own complacency.

Only time will tell whether Phil Clarke can put Tesco back on top – or whether Sir Terry Leahy should have gone shopping somewhere else for his successor.
