Vegetable growers hope celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's star power will help convince Woolworths to cancel a 40-cent-per-crate of food levy to be imposed by the supermarket to fund the Jamie's Garden promotion, a charge that could cost farmers thousands of dollars each.

The group that represents growers, Ausveg, wrote to Oliver on Tuesday asking him to step in after farmers expressed outrage at being charged an extra 40 cents per crate, on top of the up-to five per cent of the total cost of produce they are already charged to cover marketing costs.

Mr Oliver's publicity manager Peter Berry  said from London that the chef was aware of what was being said, but did not confirm if the media personality had received the letter, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

'At the end of the day, Jamie supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said.

Vegetable growers have written to Jamie Oliver, appealing for him to help cancel the new 40-cents-per-crate levy

'And in this case that means Woolworths and the many farmers and growers who have signed up for this important initiative to whom Jamie is very grateful.'

Ausveg public affairs manager William Churchill said some farmers were expecting to see a 30.5 per cent drop in profits because of the new levy.

'Growers around the country are furious at this arrangement,' he said.

'One grower will be paying $300,000 in this new levy, others will be paying tens of thousands.

'We see this as essentially double dipping on growers and this is a company that posted a $1.32 billion net profit in February.

'When you have that kind of money you don’t need to be slugging farmers’ hip pockets twice.'

The levy will be used to help fund a new campaign from the supermarket giant called Jamie's Garden

Mr Churchill said Woolworths gave growers no warning this levy was going ahead and Ausveg were only made aware of it when farmers started coming to them.

'They have not received any undertaking from Woolworths about what return they will see under this new scheme,' he said.

Ausveg spokesman William Churchill said growers were already paying up to 5 per cent of the cost of produce for marketing

'They were afraid of being seen as uncooperative and it would have impact on their business, and would receive fewer orders or be struck out all together.'

But a Woolworths spokeswoman said it was disappointing that Ausveg had not contacted them because if they had it would have been explained to them that the levy was 'entirely voluntary'.

'We could have explained...how around half our suppliers chose to work with us on the campaign which benefits the whole fruit and vegetable industry and how participating growers are paying less than 2 per cent of the cost of a case of produce,' she said.
