A Sunday teacher has been charged with abusing a teenage boy after an investigation by an investigation by Eubank Sheriff's Department in Kentucky. 

Rex Allen Murphy, 30, has been charged with first-degree sexual abuse, use of a minor under 18 for sexual performance and third-degree sodomy. 

Murphy was taken into custody and is being held in Pulaski County Detention Center where he is being held on a bond of $50,000. 

Rex Allen Murphy, pictured, was arrested on Monday night after the teenage boy approached authorities 

 According to Somerset-Kentucky.com Murphy was a Sunday school teacher at the Polly Ann Church of God in Eubank. 

 Linville Dalton, pastor at the church said 'the situation is being handled internally.'

He said that Murphy was only a Sunday school teacher at the church and had been removed of his teaching duties. 

The investigation was launched after the young victim reported the abuse authorities. 

Murphy was arrested on Monday night and taken into custody shortly after 10pm. 

According to Colin Hatfield, Eubank Chief of Police, his department launched the investigation on Friday after the youngster came forward. 

According to Chief Hatfield: ' The details were very graphic and to the point. Upon tracking down the suspect, Rex Allen Murphy  and interviewing him, he did in fact confess to the allegations.' 

He added that due to the severity of the case most details are being withheld.

Chief Hatfield said: 'The victim stated that the suspect told him on numerous occasions that by brushing his skin or shaking his hand…he could tell his sins by the power he has. He comes from family of warlocks.

'He was very scared, because the suspect, in the victim’s eyes, had been threatening his life in the form of Wicca, witchcraft, black magic.' 

Police are now investigating whether there are other victims.
