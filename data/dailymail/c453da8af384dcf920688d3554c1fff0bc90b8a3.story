She's no stranger to shaking up her image but as she stepped out in Paris today with peroxide blonde hair, Kim Kardashian made her most dramatic transition yet.

The 34-year-old was pictured leaving Le Royal Monceau hotel to go to the Balmain fashion show with her rapper husband Kanye West when she showcased her bright new locks.

Wearing a black velvet mini dress under a black coat, all eyes were on the reality star as she ventured to the highly-anticipated fashion show rocking a new 'do.

Whilst she seems happy with her new hairstyle, the hairdressing industry aren't convinced it's the right hue for our favourite reality TV star.

Speaking about the mother-of-one's short, blonde style, Jo Hansford said: 'We don't think this colour works for Kim. 

'She has completely lost her identity. Her long glossy locks had been the envy of everyone for a long time and although the blonde is a statement, she's lost her trademark and doesn't stand out from the crowd anymore. 

'Often an extreme change of hairstyle or colour can be a sign that something else dramatic is going on in someone's life so perhaps this is the case.'

Kim Kardashian kicked off Paris Fashion Week with brand new platinum blonde locks and a trip to the FROW at Balmain's A/W 2015 show. Off course the reality star wore a head-to-toe look by the brand including a ruffled velvet dress and a wide lapel coat from the Fall line.

Of course it doesn't hurt to be friends with the designer. Kim often wears custom pieces and looks picked straight from the runway and creative director Olivier Rousteing featured Kimye in his Spring/Summer menswear ad campaign. The new range featured lace jumpsuits, breezy wide-legged pants, and fringe and fur accents in vibrant jewel tones.

We're a fan of the quilted detail of Sam Edelman's jacket and the leather piping of the Agnona wrap. Wear with cropped skinnies and heels to add a bit of a glam factor to a classic look.

If her recent comments are anything to go by, her husband Kanye West may have influenced her decision. 

'Kanye likes the blonde,' she admitted at an event last year, but assured her fans she would 'stay dark'.

Of course, her new husband Kanye has played a large part in her style transformation.

Kim has spoken on many occasions about the rapper-come-designer's influence on her wardrobe choices.

Last year, Kanye introduced his wife to fashion label A.W.A.K.E. - and she loved it so much she wore it twice in four days.

Kim made a dramatic change by chopping off her locks last week, left, and  trialled the blonde hue in 2014, right, but it wasn't as dramatic as today's daring look

The brand, which is actually run by Russian designer and Harper's Bazaar former fashion director, Natalia Alaverdian, was discovered online by Kim's husband, Mr West.

'He researches everything and he loves to find new talent, and he introduced me to her and told me she’s part Armenian, and so am I,' Kim told WWD.

'I’m all about empowering other women to be successful and it’s really important to me to support designers that I believe in and friends that I believe in that are hardworking.'

In one episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kanye is even seen clearing out her closet to make way for a sleeker look.

And it seemed his help worked - Kim has been fully ingratiated into the fashion world.

How to go brunette to blonde?

If you are looking to try a new edgy look, going platinum is a great way to stop people in their tracks- especially an all over platinum blonde and I think this is exactly what Kim and Kanye are looking to do at the moment.

Usually as Technicians, we look to give our clients the most suitable, beautiful hair colour, working with their skin tone, eye colour etc. to give them a look tailored perfectly to them. This colour on Kim is none of the above but is very editorial, high fashion and certainly creates a statement.

At some point in her life every woman needs to make the jump from brunette to blonde, although there are many variations it is important to remember when going for such an extreme blonde to consider the effects on your hairs condition, you will need to do regular treatments to keep it feeling healthy.

Best product to use?

For any woman looking to achieve this look, I would advise it be only done professionally to avoid serious damage and brassy tones. At HOB Salons, we use Wella Professional products and would obtain this look by using the Blondor Lightening System.

How to maintain the colour blonde?

To maintain your blonde hue, I would recommend Wellas ‘hero product’ SP Silver Blond Shampoo (£16.50 @ HOB Salons) to keep the blonde fresh and clean and prevent it from going brassy.
