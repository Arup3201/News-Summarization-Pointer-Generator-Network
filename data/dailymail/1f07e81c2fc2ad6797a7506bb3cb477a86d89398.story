Controversial: Helen Grant MP's son lives with his grandmother, which puts him in a good state school catchment area

A Tory Minister is at the centre of an elitism row after it emerged that her son has secured a place at a exclusive grammar school by living with his grandmother.

Helen Grant was embroiled in a scandal over expenses last year when it was revealed that she lived not in her constituency of Maidstone, Kent, but in a £1.8 million home in Surrey.

But although she chooses not to stay in the town she represents Mrs Grant’s son does live there – with the MP’s mother and within the catchment area of the academically successful Maidstone Grammar.

The unusual arrangement has led to claims that Mrs Grant had been able to take advantage of a free, elite  education for her son at the state-funded selective school, despite living 40 miles away.

Her controversial living arrangements first came under the spotlight last year when it was revealed she was claiming £20,000 for a flat in  the capital – even though her Reigate home is within the London commuter belt, where MPs cannot claim allowances for second homes. However she was allowed to take the money as her constituency is outside the ‘exclusion zone’, even if her home isn’t.

Now the MP is facing further pressure over the fact that her 17-year-old son lives with his grandmother, Gladys, in Sutton Valence, just over four miles from the school where last year an impressive 97 per cent of pupils achieved five or more good GCSEs.

Last night Michael Pyke, from the Campaign for State Education group, said: ‘This seems to be a good example of the way the system benefits wealthy people.

‘If Kent was all-comprehensive, I very much doubt whether Mrs Grant would have made this arrangement.’

Kent is one of the last grammar school bastions in Britain, containing 33 of the country’s remaining 164 schools. Despite pressure from parents and pro-selection Tory MPs, David Cameron has refused to back their expansion, leading to fierce competition for the few schools which still exist. Selective state education is not available in Surrey.

Mrs Grant, 51, succeeded former Minister Ann Widdecombe to the Maidstone seat at the 2010 Election, with a majority of under 6,000.

But political opponents have drawn up a petition calling for Mrs Grant’s resignation since her expenses were revealed. It says: ‘In a government that is destroying the lives of those most in need, the Equalities Minister is busy making her life very comfortable.’

Mrs Grant takes home £97,000 from her political job and a further £26,000 in fees from the legal company she established 20 years ago.

While she claims £20,000 rent on her riverside flat in London, the Tory MP in whose Reigate constituency she lives, Crispin Blunt, is not allowed to claim anything.

A spokeswoman for the Minister said: ‘Mrs Grant declines to comment on issues regarding her children.’
