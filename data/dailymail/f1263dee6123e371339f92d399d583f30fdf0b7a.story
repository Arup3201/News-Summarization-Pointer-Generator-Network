It's a dream come true for many men. Imagine coming home from a hard day's work to find every tap in your house had been re-plumbed to flow with chilled lager.

That's exactly what happened to one New Zealand man who fell victim to the ultimate in practical jokes, filmed by his friends on a battery of cameras hidden throughout his home.

With the help of a local brewery the group of pals carried out the elaborate operation after their friend, identified only as Russ, went out.

A dream come true? A New Zealand homeowner's 
taps flow with beer instead of water after his friends teamed up with a 
local brewery to play an elaborate prank on him that has since gone 
viral on YouTube

Jokers: The gang teamed up with a local brewery to make their pal's taps flow with the amber liquid

Video of the prank, which is to be used as part of a viral advertising campaign, shows the men lying in wait for Russ to drive off, then crawling beneath his house to connect his mains water supply to beer kegs.

'Bit of a prank on our brother Russ,' one says. 'Basically, idea is, we're plumbing his whole house with beer.

'This guy's going to get home, then it's going to get awesome.'

After testing the new supply, the gang rig their friend's entire home with CCTV surveillance cameras to capture his reaction to the practical joke.  

Putting the work in: The pranksters waited until their friend, named only as Russ, went out before smuggling barrels of Tui lager into the crawl space beneath his house

Then Russ tests out the supply. 'What the hell?' he exclaims, inspecting the stream of alcoholic beverage with a sniff.

'It looks like cold beer too,' he says to his partner.

The
 bewildered homeowner gets into his overalls to crawl beneath his house 
to investigate where, monitored by his buddies on CCTV, he discovers the
 ruse and laughs.

The group then lies in wait for him in his front garden, surprising him with a roar as he emerges from the crawl space.

A spokesman for New Zealand brewer Tui told ninemsn that the video was a collaboration with an enterprising group of friends.

'It was an idea that was put up by Tui and they knew friends of friends of people that worked at Tui,' he said.

'They're all legit mates and they are constantly playing pranks on each other so it was a match made in heaven.'

He added that no-one was paid to take part in the film.
