Two convicted murderers serving life sentences are to tie the knot in Britain’s first gay wedding in prison, it has emerged.

Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov, 40, who was jailed in 1997 for what a judge labelled a ‘callous, chilling killing’, is to marry fellow prisoner Marc Goodwin.

Goodwin, 31, was the leader of a gang that roamed the streets of Blackpool looking for homosexuals to attack.

He was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years in 2007 after being found guilty of murdering Malcolm Benfold, 57, who was beaten to death. His trial heard that he and two friends had agreed to go ‘gay bashing’.

Goodwin and Gallatinov – who strangled 28-year-old gay man Adrian Kaminsky – met while behind bars, according to the Daily Mirror.

They have been given official permission for the ceremony at HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire.

No details of the wedding have been revealed, although a notice of the marriage has reportedly been posted at the register office in the nearest town, Beverley. On the notice, both men give their occupation as bar staff.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman commented: ‘Prisoners are entitled to apply to be married in prison under the Marriages Act 1983. 

'This would take place at no cost to the taxpayer and there is no possibility that they would share a cell.’

It is believed that the couple had considered a civil partnership until a change in the law in March last year made homosexual marriage legal in Britain.

A string of notorious inmates have tied the knot behind bars, including the East End gangster Reggie Kray who married Roberta Jones, then 38, at Maidstone Prison in Kent in 1997.

At the time, Kray was serving a life sentence for the murder of another gangland figure, Jack ‘The Hat’ McVitie.

And Mickey McAvoy, who was sentenced to 25 years for his part in the 1983 Brink’s-Mat gold bullion robbery, married his second wife Kathy in the gym of HMP Leicester three years after his crime.

Gallatinov, of Manchester, who previously served a prison sentence for sexually abusing children, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the murder of Mr Kaminsky – meaning he could be eligible for parole in two years.

He spoke to his victim on a gay chat line before luring him to his home. At the time of his sentencing, Judge Rhys Davies QC said the murder was ‘a cold-blooded, well planned, callous, chilling and apparently motiveless killing’.

He added: ‘You are a dangerous young man and you present a considerable risk to the public. The defendant acted without pity, concern or remorse.

‘He was described by one of the psychiatrists as a dangerous man. He does not suffer from mental illness but is wholly devoid of moral judgment,’ he added.

The case was particularly shocking because Gallatinov was under police surveillance at the time and had actually told an undercover detective that he intended to commit murder.

Officers were positioned outside his house at the time of the killing and he photographed his victim with a camera that he had been lent by detectives.

Mr Kaminsky’s body was later found nearly naked in the boot of Gallatinov’s car after he was stopped on a motorway.

Goodwin, originally of Airdrie, near Glasgow, is expected to serve at least another ten years behind bars. He has been visited by his victim’s sister, Wendy Bridge, to whom he expressed remorse.

She recalled: ‘He said he was really sorry and wished there was still the death penalty as he would be dead too.’
