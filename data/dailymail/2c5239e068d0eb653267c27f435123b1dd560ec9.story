A paralyzed man walked down the aisle to his wedding in upstate New York on Saturday.

A robotic exoskeleton called an Ekso allowed groom Matt Ficarra to make the trek with wife Jordan Basile to 'Sign, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours,' The Syracuse Post-Standard reported.

Both guests and bridesmaids cried during the newlyweds' walk, the newspaper reported. 

Nuptials: Bride Jordan Basile and groom Matt Ficarra were married on Saturday 

The happy couple: Ficarra, who was paralyzed three years ago, was able to stand and walk by using a robotic exoskeleton

Ficarra told the newspaper he used the device in visits each week at an Allentown rehabilitation center.

'It feels great to be married,' he told The Syracuse Post-Standard of the nuptials, which took place in DeWitt. 'And I am so happy to have met my goal of walking at my wedding.'

His father Frank Ficarra told the paper before his son said 'I do,' 'It's spectacular. I am so proud of him. He's determined and he accomplishes what he sets out to do.'

Ficarra became paralyzed after a summertime boating accident three years ago, according to The Syracuse Post-Standard.

'I didn't realize how shallow the water was,' he told the newspaper. 'On one of the jumps, the side of the boat was wet and I slipped. I went into the water headfirst.'

Emotional: Both guests and bridesmaids cried during the newlyweds' walk

I do! The couple were engaged last year at Christmastime 

'I remember looking up at the sun through the water,' he also said. 'I was floating, and then I remember not being able to move anything - not even a finger or a toe. I got very calm and accepted that this was the end. Then at the last second someone scooped me out of the water.'

The two texted six months in the wake of the boating accident then went out, Basile told the newspaper. She earlier twice rejected his offers, calling him an 'obnoxious' college athlete.

'We got to know each other that way before we started dating,' she said. 'He was more settled then, and I was in a better place too. We have been together every moment since then. We have fun together, and we don't let life pass us by.'

Basile also said of her husband's walk before the wedding 'I'm so happy for him.'

'Walking down that aisle means a lot to him. But for me, it doesn't really matter. He could be sitting or crawling down the aisle - all that matters to me is that he's by my side.'
