A group of England football supporters have been injured in an alleged attack ahead of Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Ukraine in Kiev.

Between 50 and 100 hooded Ukrainians armed with knives arrived at Shato Bar on the main tourism promenade on Sunday evening and began to goad the England supporters.

Fighting soon broke out between the two groups and police arrived on the scene within 10 minutes.

'Most visits are trouble free. But foreign nationals have been the victims of violent crime in Kiev and other major cities. In some cases attacks have been racially motivated.

Travellers of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent and individuals belonging to religious minorities should take extra care.

'Be alert to the possibility of street crime and petty theft. Foreigners may appear to be lucrative targets. Where possible, avoid walking alone late at night in dark or poorly lit streets.

'Keep valuables and cash safe and out of sight, especially in crowded areas, tourist spots, and public transport, where pickpockets and bag snatchers operate.'

Three England fans were taken to hospital following the fight, according to local reports.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of incidents in Kiev involving British nationals.
'We are providing consular assistance.'

The fight, involving 40 English fans and more than 20 Ukrainians, broke out after the two sides traded insults, police said.

'Three British citizens ... were taken to hospital with wounds to the head and hands.

'After getting medical treatment they were taken back to their accommodation,' a statement said.

Police in Ukraine have launched what is being described as 'unprecedented' security measures to avoid a repeat of Sunday's attack on England fans in Kiev.

Five hundred supporters will arrive on flights from London today with another thousand expected in the Ukrainian capital tomorrow.

According to reports in Kiev today, more police officers have been drafted in and the security operation significantly stepped up after three England fans were hospitalised following clashes with a local gang carrying knives and glass bottles on Sunday night.

'Police in full body armour are on duty all over Kiev,' said a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. 'We must not allow a repetition of Sunday's scenario.'

A win for England would move them to within touching distance of a place in next summer's finals in Brazil.

Roy Hodgson's side top Group H with 15 points, ahead of Montenegro on goal difference. Ukraine sit third with 14 points.
