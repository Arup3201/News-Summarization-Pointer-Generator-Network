For humans, sunscreen is a saviour, protecting us from harmful UV rays which can cause cancer.

But the protective lotion could also be responsible for killing countless sea creatures, scientists have warned.

A new study claims that when certain 
sunscreen ingredients wash off skin and into the sea, they can become 
toxic to some of the ocean’s tiniest inhabitants - phytoplankton.

A new study claims that sunscreen ingredients such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide react in the sunlight and form toxic compounds that wash off the skin into the sea. Compounds such as hydrogen peroxide can harm phytoplankton - tiny marine organisms. This chemical equation shows how titanium dioxide (TiO2) eventually produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) when it is exposed to solar radiation

Titanium 
dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles, which are common sunscreen 
ingredients, react with ultraviolet light from the sun and form new 
compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide.

High
 amounts of hydrogen peroxide can harm phytoplankton - the microscopic 
algae that feed everything from small fish to shrimp to whales.

The research was conducted by scientists from the Universities of the 
Balearic Islands and Río San Pedro, in Spain.

To
 investigate the impact that beachgoers could be having on the 
environment, they went to Majorca’s Palmira beach on the Mediterranean.

There, they were among about 10,000 beachgoers - a small portion of the more than 
200 million tourists that flock to Mediterranean shores every year.

Based
 on lab tests, seawater sampling and tourism data, the researchers 
concluded that titanium dioxide from sunscreen was largely responsible 
for a dramatic summertime spike in hydrogen peroxide levels in coastal 
waters - with potentially dangerous consequences for aquatic life.

If plankton are killed, the impact could be huge, because they are the main food source for larger marine animals, according to the study, which was published in the ACS journal Environmental Science & Technology.

Antonio Tovar-Sanchez and David Sánchez-Quiles agree that sunscreen is the best way to protect skin from the sun’s rays if staying inside is not an option.

But they say that when sunbathers venture into the sea to cool off, some of their sunscreen washes off into the water.

Wearing sun cream is not a reliable way to prevent getting skin cancer, scientists warned in June.

A groundbreaking study into the way UV radiation attacks the skin has revealed that long-lasting damage is not stopped by sunscreen.

While an SPF cream can stop sunburn and the short-term effects of sunbathing, it allows enough rays through to cause potentially fatal disease in the long term.

Anyone who spends more than a short time in the sun should make sure they are covered up and should not rely on sunscreen alone, experts warned.

Scientists at Manchester University and London’s Institute of Cancer Research carried out the world’s first molecular study into the way malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is caused.

Their paper, published in the journal Nature, revealed that even highest grade SPF 50 suncream allows sufficient UV radiation through to damage the DNA in the skin’s pigment cells.

Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, with more than 13,000 people diagnosed with the disease every year.

The scientists found that sunscreen could not stop solar radiation causing a mutation in the skin’s ‘guardian gene’ which produces proteins that protect against UV.

With the gene damaged, the skin is vulnerable to further damage from the sun and more likely to develop a tumour.
