A dog owner nearly lost his leg after he caught  a flesh-eating infection and blood poisoning from a tiny scratch caused by his puppy.

Chris Longley, 29, was playing with his six-month-old German Shepherd Wolfie in a park near his home in Reading, Berkshire, when the dog accidentally scraped his claw along his shin.

Mr Longley didn't even notice the scratch until he got home, but after 24 hours it had started to ache and his leg muscle started to spasm.

The next he was admitted to hospital with a severe skin infection and septicaemia after bacteria in the scratch caused necrosis of the tissue in his leg.

Doctors at the Royal Berkshire Hospital warned that any further delay in seeking medical attention could have resulted in Mr Longley losing his leg - or even dying from severe blood poisoning.

'I ended up being in hospital for a week and off work for a month - and all for a little scratch from a lovely puppy,' he said.

'At first I felt a bit silly, but the doctors took it very seriously.

'They said if I hadn't come into hospital when I did it could have been very, very serious.

'Worst case scenario could have been death due to the blood poisoning and necrosis, but ultimately losing a leg was quite a likely outcome if I had left it for a week.

'It could very easily got gangrenous and I could have lost the bottom of my leg.'

Mr Longley said he had not realised he was hurt until he returned home and spotted a four-inch red line on his leg, which he thought nothing more of

Software development manager Mr Longley and his wife Jen, 32, got Wolfie in June and the dog scratched him on his left shin while taking a Sunday walk in October.

Mr Longley said he had not realised he was hurt until he returned home and spotted a four-inch red line on his leg, of which he thought nothing more.

But a day later it started to ache and he was sent home from work when his leg started to spasm and he felt weak.

NHS walk-in centre staff directed him towards the accident and emergency department at Royal Berkshire Hospital.

Mr Longley - who by this time was finding it difficult to stay awake due to the poison travelling through his blood - was given super-strength antibiotics to treat the infection.

After two days the infection had started to spread and tissue at the scratch site on his left leg turned black as the cells started to die

However, after two days the infection had started to spread and tissue at the scratch site on his left leg turned black as the cells started to die.

Surgeons - who were worried it would reach the bone - rushed him in for emergency surgery to cut the flesh from his leg.

During surgery Mr Longley had a bad reaction to the anaesthetic and his blood pressure dropped dangerously low.

But he pulled through, and was kept in hospital for a week, before three more weeks of rest at home.

Relieved Mr Longley said: 'I was wearing shorts because it was nice out and we were just playing around and he just caught me with his front claw.

'It was a bit red when I got back, but I didn't think anything of it.

'A day later it started to get redder but I thought it would just got better on its own.

'But at work they sent me home at lunch to get it looked at.

'It was red and angry and it was getting hot and my calf was quite tough, but at that point I still thought it would be fine.

'Once I got to A and E I wasn't responding very well.

Mr Longley, who has been left with a large scar on his leg, said: 'I don't blame Wolfie - he didn't even know what he was doing - but things might have been a bit different had I lost a leg' 

'I was very feverish and very quiet and I was getting tired.

'I was put on two IV antibiotics and admitted, but after two days they decided I should have an operation to get ride of the necrotising tissue.

'It's quite disgusting - they had to cut an extra two or three millimetres around the black bits and then they had to cut down to get into it.'

Mr Longley's' skin had also started to 'bubble' and doctors had to lift the skin to clean underneath.

He returned home on strong painkillers and antibiotics to see Wolfie, who was unaware of the damage he had caused.

Mr Longley, who has been left with a large scar on his leg, said: 'I don't blame Wolfie - he didn't even know what he was doing - but things might have been a bit different had I lost a leg.'
