Radio shock jock Alan Jones has hit out at Tony Abbott for signing a free-trade deal with China, saying it does not pass the 'pub test'.

The Prime Minister appeared on the 2GB host's radio show on Monday morning where he was savaged by Mr Jones over the deal, projected to be worth at least $18 billion over a decade.

'To win an election – and you're not worth two bob in opposition – to win an election, you've got to pass the pub test,' Mr Jones said.

'Prime Minister I'm telling you out there, they are on fire, in the pubs, they don't swallow this.'

Trade experts say the deal is a boon for Australian consumers, who will get cheaper footwear and clothing, and to Australian exporters of dairy, beef and other food. 

But Mr Jones disagreed, and told Mr Abbott he did not have a mandate to implement the deal.

'I've had this out with [trade minister] Andrew Robb here, he thinks I'm a nutter,' he said.

'We're told, I'm told, that there will be billions of dollars in new markets for Australia exports.

'That the diary farmers will have tariff-free access. But hang on, the dairy farms are owned by China.

'Can Tony Abbott go and buy a farm in China? No, the answer is no Prime Minister, the answer is no he can't, nor can he buy a coal mine, nor can he buy a steel mill.'

Trade expert Alan Oxley said the deal was a positive thing, and the main benefit for consumers in the long run would be in the fashion industry.

'But with the way the dollar is jumping around the place, we might not notice for a while,' said Mr Oxley, principal of ITS Global.

Ms Oxley said Australian exporters of food – especially dairy – would be big beneficiaries of the trade deal in the near future.

'In China there is a fair degree of fear about healthy food,' he said.

'There's a rising fear of people in the middle class willing to pay more for products, and the demand for food is just stupendous.

'That's the future for our farmers.'

Mr Oxley said the trade deal would also enable Australian services industries to do business in China. 

'Medical services, finance and insurance companies will be able operate in other markets.

'They'll be able to expand their business and do more business.

'That's the real long-term importance of this, because it's not goods that generates the growth it's services.'

Under the deal, 85 per cent of all Australian exports will enter China tariff-free, NewsCorp Australia reports.

This is expected to rise to 93 per cent within four years and 95 per cent when the deal is fully in force in more than a decade.

Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who has done much of the heavy lifting on the deal over the past year, says Australian manufacturers, farmers, miners and the service sector should be very happy with the agreement.

Beef and dairy producers are set to benefit from a phase-down in Chinese tariffs, with dairy exports moving to a similar tariff reduction schedule as New Zealand, NewsCorp reports.

China is Australia's number-one trading partner, with the two-way flow of goods and services exceeding $150 billion last year.

Trade between the countries was worth just a quarter of that amount a decade ago.
