Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's new favourite clothing label are launching a range of eco wedding dresses.

The British supermodel, 27, has been wearing pieces from hot LA label Reformation all summer, including an adorable two-piece on date night last week.

All pieces from the hot LA label are made from three fabric sources including deadstock material, vintage clothing and eco-friendly threads - including their new bridal gowns.

'So
 much of what I design is for a modern woman who doesn't want to adjust 
her style or buy a dress she will never wear again - especially when it 
comes to getting dressed for a wedding,' says owner Yael Aflalo.

The brand has had a celebrity following since the start thanks to their eco ethos, and figure-flattering designs.

Their cutting-edge co-ords,
 floral maxis and spaghetti strap slips have earned them a place in the 
most A-list of wardrobes. And the best bit: this celebrity label is 
actually affordable, with
 prices starting at £40 for a top and going up to about £150 for a 
dress.

For those Brits after their festival-inspired, boho fashion vibes there's even free shipping to the UK.

Celebrities
 like the label because everything is produced in limited amounts, 
meaning that it's unlikely anyone will show up to an an event wearing 
the same thing as them.

Reformation carries over similar shapes from the most popular styles in previous collections

Fans can expect new bridal, bridesmaid and wedding guest outfits in rich autumnal colours

The Lake dress, a pretty wrap floral print maxi, comes in at £194 ($328)

And it's 
not just Rosie who's raving about Reformation: UK fashion icons such 
Alexa Chung and Cressida Bonas have been spotted wearing styles 
from the brand.

Their dressmakers either up-cycle vintage threads or create something new out of leftover fabric and each piece is made in Reformation's own LA factory.

While Reformation do carry over 
similar shapes from the most popular styles in previous collections, all
 products are limited edition.

They
 hope their new wedding collection will comprise of dresses that 
fashionistas actually want to wear more than once in their lives.

Fans
 can expect new bridal, bridesmaid and wedding guest outfits in rich 
autumnal colours  such as classic white and ivory, royal blue and merlot
 red.

Rosie recently opened up about her relationship of more than four years with her Jason Statham, telling Net-a-Porter what makes them tick.

'Jason
 and I just make each other laugh,' the blonde bombshell told the 
high-end fashion website. 'Most of the time we’re p***ing ourselves 
laughing, whispering comments in each other’s ears.

'Oh, you know. Naughty stuff,' she added. 'I’m not interested in hanging out with boys. I have all the man I need!'

She went for a romantic dinner in Beverley Hills last week with her action man beau, 47, choosing an adorable 
Reformation two-piece for the occasion.

Rosie bared her toned midriff in a pale pink crop top with flowing light blue print trousers from the brand as they visited the upscale Matsuhisa sushi bar.

We're just wondering whether the stunner would wear one of their up-cycled bridal gowns should he pop the question?
