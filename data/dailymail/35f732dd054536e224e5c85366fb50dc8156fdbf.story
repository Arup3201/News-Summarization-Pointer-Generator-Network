Free agent footballer Ray Rice chose a Christmas fundraiser collecting toys for needy children for his first public appearance since a video of him knocking out his wife in an elevator saw him dropped by the Baltimore Ravens.

The 27-year-old running back stepped out on Wednesday for the Toys for Tots fundraiser, held at the Jimmy's Famous Seafood restaurant in Dundalk.

Giving an interview at the event, Rice said it 'feels good to be out and amongst the Baltimore community and just to give back', and addressed the aggravated assault charges laid against him after punching then-fiancee Janay Palmer, whom he has since married. 

'I made a horrible mistake in my life, but, you know, if you truly believe in second chances, you know, they will forgive me,' Rice told CBS Baltimore.

'I think all of the fans here, all the people here, really look deep into who I am.'

Rice's wife, however, did accompany him.

Last month, an arbitrator lifter the indefinite suspension from the NFL against Rice.

National Football League Players Association spokesman, George Atallah, said at the time: 'I can only confirm the suspension has been vacated, effective immediately.'

Under the vacation, approved by former U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, Rice is now eligible to sign with any NFL team - and can do so as soon as he receives an offer. 

It came two months after the footballer was suspended from the league indefinitely after he was filmed punching Palmer with his left fist in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino.

Hillary Nadler wrote: 'It is unbelievable that Ray Rice is able to play again. I hope no one signs him,' while Marty Coultas said: 'Who's gonna sign Ray Rice? No one. Not happening.' 

Detroit-based journalist Ron Fournier tweeted: 'Any poor excuse of a man who hits a woman is kicked out of any self-respecting club. The NFL is a millionaires'/billionaires' club of enablers.'

And Andrew Sheehy, from Scarborough in England, added: 'If Ray Rice plays another down in the NFL again, linebackers will line up left, right and center to hit him as hard as they can.'

However, not everyone was opposed to Rice rejoining the game, with Twitter user AJ Gould saying: 'Glad Ray Rice got reinstated... Hope Roger Goodell gets fired!' 

Initially, Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February.

However, after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely.

Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. 

During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice. 

In addition to testimonies from both Rice and Palmer - who supported her husband - Judge Jones heard from  NFL security chief Jeffrey Miller and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome.

In her decision Judge Jones wrote: 'Because Rice did not mislead the commissioner and because there were no new facts on which the commissioner could base his increased suspension, I find that the imposition of the indefinite suspension was arbitrary.

'I therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on Rice. The provisions of the first discipline - those regarding making continued use of counseling and other professional services, having no further involvement with law enforcement, and not committing any additional violations of league policies - still stand.'  

Also last month, Palmer - now Janay Rice - spoke toESPN about the Atlantic City incident, saying it stemmed from an 'insignificant' argument between her and her husband.

She told the broadcaster: 'As we were arguing, he was on his phone and not looking at me. I went to reach for his phone, and when he grabbed it back, he spit at me and I slapped him.

'We got into the elevator and what happened inside is still foggy to me. The only thing I know - and I can't even say I "remember" because I only know from what Ray has told me - is that I slapped him again and then he hit me. I remember nothing else from inside the elevator.'

After coming round in the casino lobby, surrounded by police, Palmer was taken to the police station with her husband, who kept telling her 'It's going to be okay. We'll be okay'. 

Explaining her decision for standing by Rice, she said although she was 'angry', she 'knew it wasn't him' and he had never acted like that before. 

'No matter how long we have known each other and no matter what the circumstance is, Ray understands that violent behavior like this, even one time, is never acceptable,' she said.
