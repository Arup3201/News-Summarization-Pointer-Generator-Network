The blue snow hit an industrial zone on the outskirts of the city and one resident said it smelt like iron

But local media reports claimed to have solved the mystery of the bluish hue – and said a local factory using dye for Easter eggs had had a ‘minor spill’.

The Viteks Company reassured locals that the colourant does not pose any health risks, LifeNews reported.

Yesterday, local media reported people’s concerns – and a news presenter Alexandra Artamonova, from Telefact, said she felt a ‘sweet taste in the mouth’ simply from standing near the snow.

She added that people had been complaining of a sore throat after passing near the contaminated area.

It was also reported that the government had not responded to the case.

Local media reports later claimed to have solved the mystery, attributing it to a factory which had a dye spill

Local resident Dmitry Kudryonok told RT.com: ‘As the sun rose today, everyone notices the blue rooftops, blue parking lots. We started panicking a bit.’

He added the snow, which he said smelt a little bit like iron, brightened up the area’s gloomy surroundings.

Two years ago, more than 1,500 people were injured from flying glass and debris after a relatively small asteroid exploded in the atmosphere over Chelyabinsk.

The meteor, which exploded near the city in February 2013, was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century.
