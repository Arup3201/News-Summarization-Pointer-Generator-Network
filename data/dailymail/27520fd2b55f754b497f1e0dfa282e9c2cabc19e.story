The grandmother of a three-year-old boy who tragically died just two days before Christmas after crashing his motorcycle has paid a heartbreaking tribute to her grandson.

The boy suffered abdominal injuries was riding on a private rural property in Millaa Millaa on the Atherton Tablelands on Wednesday. 

His grandmother Sari Geraghty said the family were in shock, saying it was a 'freak accident'.

'He meant so much to us. He touched so many lives,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'We're struggling to come to terms with it.'

When the toddler fell off the bike he got back up while crying at the Campbell Road address, The Courier Mail reported. 

It is thought the father of the child was there at the time of the incident. 

A Queensland Ambulance Service spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the boy was taken to Atherton District Hospital by road in an ambulance.

She said the service was called to the property at 11.13am on Tuesday and the child was in 'an altered level of consciousness'.

RACQ Careflight were also alerted to the incident and arrived with a medical team, but were not required to transport the boy.

A Queensland police spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia officers were called to investigate the incident and the boy was riding a motorcycle.

He said a report would be provided to the coroner. 

A Millaa Millaa resident told Daily Mail Australia the toddler's family were a local dairy family.

'It's a very small town... I just heard about it 15 minutes ago,' she said on Wednesday.
