Little Alliyah Broadby has spent her whole life in hospitals, but that's all about to change for the 14-month-old when she finally gets to move home next month.

Her mum Kathryn Gordon, 39, and dad Mark Broadby, 43, received the news on Sunday that their daughter will be able to leave the Brisbane hospital and move to the Gold Coast Hospital nearer to their home on September 8.

The move - green lighted by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman after she appealed to him for help - will allow Alliyah, who who has suffered a range of breathing, lung and heart complications since birth, to go home during the day and spend more time with her siblings - but she will have to go back to hospital each night.

The ordeal will be made easier for her parents who live just a few kilometres away from the hospital.

Mrs Gordon told Daily Mail Australia that it has been a challenging 14 months of sweat and tears for her family but she wasn't going to back down until changes were made for her daughter.

'I'm not easy and one to take no for an answer so we needed to push the boundaries because when it's your own daughter - we're her only advocate,' she said.

'Sometimes you have to step on a few people's toes for whats best for Alliyah and our four kids back at our Gold Coast home.'

Mrs Gordan and her husband have four children together - Kaitlyn and Kailen, who are twins age 11, Ashlynn, 13 and Darienne 15. Mr Broadby also has a daughter name Dimity, 22, who lives in Tasmania.

'We have fought hard for the transition because we have a big family and it was not possible for us to just pick up our bags and move to Brisbane.

'My husband and I have had sleepless nights and we've tried to rotate our weeks so I would stay with Alliyah one week and Mark would do the other and so on.

Mrs Gordon said Christmas is looking promising but will have their fingers and toes crossed that she will be at home permanently by the end of September

The bubbly tot has only spent one night away from a hospital and at her family's Gold Coast home on her birthday, when a nurse had to stay with her overnight.

But next month, Alliyah will be able to have her treatments at the Gold Coast University Hospital.

'Alliyah will get to come home during the day and spend more quality time with her brothers and sisters but we will have to take her back to the hospital every night.

'It's still not ideal but at this stage, it is a lot better to finally have her in our home but we are hoping for the hopsital to find a night time carer so she gets to be home permanently.

'Christmas is looking promising but we have our fingers and toes crossed that she will be at home permanently by the end of September.

'We still don't have a clear reason as to why she has the condition but I like to call it the 'cute syndrome' - because she's too cute to be sick. She is a smart little cookie and the support we've had from everyone has been exceptional.'

Next month: Alliyah will get to go home during the day and spend more quality time with her brothers and sisters but will be taken back to hospital every night

Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said since Alliyah was born at Tweed Heads in July last year, her complex needs have taken her to intensive care units at the Royal Women’s, Royal Children’s and Mater Children’s Hospitals.

'She has had strong support every day from her family, but for her mum, dad and brothers and sisters, it has been a tough time.'

Mr Springborg said Alliyah’s health and continued development was the number one priority for all involved in the case and he thanked her medical team and carers for their determined and professional support.

Alliyah Broadby, who has spent her entire life sleeping in a hospital bed, will finally be allowed to go home each day

'Now we have agreement on the next phase of Alliyah’s care, which will begin with a move to the Gold Coast University Hospital about the middle of next month,' he said.

'Alliyah was born with a respiratory condition that is capably managed by clinicians here at the Mater. It’s a specialised area of care not previously available on the Gold Coast, which will be provided under the plan.'

Her parents couldn't be happier with the news and on their tribute page to their little girl tittled  Alliyah's Journey, her parents wrote on Thursday: 'FINALLY!!! GREAT NEWS!!! We are getting out of the Mater and back to the Gold Coast.

'We hope that our stay at the Gold Coast Hospital will be short lived and we get home permanently sooner rather than later. Good news is, we will get to take Alliyah home EVERYDAY!!'

Mrs Broadby told AAP: 'When people look at her, they just see her as being a little girl apart from the trach in her neck'.

Alliyah has had a tracheostomy, a surgical hole made in her neck, so she can be attached to a respirator when she sleeps because her breathing stops.

The Broadbys have had to take shifts staying with Alliyah at the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane, while the other looks after the couple's other four children on the Gold Coast.

Alliyah is being transferred to the Gold Coast University Hospital which much closer to her home than the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane where she has been receiving her treatment

'We're her lifeline,' Mrs Broadby told reporters.

'No nurse can put the time and effort that we have into her.'

Mrs Broadby said her daughter's cheeky personality, which is coupled with a disarming smile, often belies the full extent of her medical troubles.

'Sometimes people go "it doesn't look like there's much wrong with her". But she is a complex-needs child and she does require constant supervision.'

Mrs Broadby wrote to Premier Campbell Newman earlier this year about her daughter's condition, which prompted a transfer plan to the Gold Coast University Hospital.

Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said the transfer would come about in stages but would likely be underway in September.

'The important thing about returning Alliyah home is that she will be able to be monitored at the Gold Coast University Hospital,' he said.

'I am proud of the work our Gold Coast and Mater medical teams have done to help Alliyah and her family,' he said.

'Alliyah will move to the Gold Coast Children’s Critical Care Unit as part of a staged care plan, which is only possible because of new services now in place at Gold Coast University Hospital.

'The transfer requires training and thorough careful planning, but we are all confident that Alliyah will move in September.

Gold Coast Health Board Chair Ian Langdon said that making sure the health needs of his own community were being met was a priority for his Board.

'The Children’s Critical Care service is just one of many new services including neonatal intensive care, cardiac surgery, and radiation therapy now available on the Gold Coast,' he said.'There are not only new facilities at the Gold Coast but also the clinical expertise and experience required to provide clinical care for children with complex cases.'This has only been possible through strong partnerships with fellow providers such as the Mater Children’s Hospital.'Mr Langdon said future plans for Alliyah would be determined by the clinicians who cared for her, working in partnership with the family to achieve the best outcomes for Alliyah.
