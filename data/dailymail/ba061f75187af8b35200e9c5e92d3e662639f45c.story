Osteopath Dr Stephen Ward could have his 1963 conviction for living off immoral earnings quashed

Stephen Ward, the high-society fixer at the centre of the Profumo sex scandal, could have his conviction for living off immoral earnings quashed.

One of Britain’s leading barristers is to conduct a review into Ward’s 1963 conviction that was linked to Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies.

Geoffrey Robertson QC, a well-known human rights campaigner regarded as one of the country’s finest legal minds, is to conduct a forensic analysis of both the case against Ward and the conduct of the trial.

Sources close to the inquiry say that, dependent on the review’s results, pressure could be brought on the judiciary to overturn Ward’s conviction posthumously.

The disclosure comes on the eve of the launch of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical – called Stephen Ward – about Ward’s life.

A decision to prosecute Ward, who took a fatal overdose the night before his trial ended, remains highly controversial.

He was a successful and well-connected osteopath and portrait artist who became mired in Britain’s most notorious sex scandal of the 20th Century.

It was sparked by the revelation that War Minister John Profumo was having an affair with showgirl Christine Keeler. She was also said to be sleeping with a Russian naval attache.

The disclosures ruined Profumo’s 
political career amid questions about national security – and the 
consequences for Ward were even worse.

The osteopath had introduced Profumo and Keeler at a now infamous party at Lord Astor’s mansion in 1961. A penchant for taking young women such as Keeler and her friend Rice- Davies under his wing, and introducing them to powerful men, made him the perfect scapegoat.

He was arrested in June 1963 and charged
with living off their immoral earnings, as well as with a separate 
charge of procuring prostitutes.

When the trial began, it quickly became clear that there were flaws in the prosecution’s case. Ronna Ricardo, a prostitute called to testify against Ward, withdrew much of her evidence and told the court the police had bullied her into taking part.

Ward’s defence team also found serious problems with the evidence brought by a second prostitute, Vickie Barrett.

But Ward became convinced he was going to be found guilty and overdosed on sleeping pills. In a suicide note he wrote: ‘I’m sorry to disappoint the vultures. I feel the day is lost. The ritual sacrifice is demanded and I cannot face it.’

Ward was still in a coma on July 31 when he was found guilty of living off immoral earnings but cleared of procuring prostitutes. He died three days later.

In an account of the trial published the following year, campaigning journalist Ludovic Kennedy argued there was more evidence to suggest Keeler had been supported by Ward rather than the other way around.

The scapegoating of  Ward is the subject of  the new Lloyd Webber musical, which has been  co-written by Oscar-winning lyricists  Christopher Hampton and Don Black.

Hampton said last night he would welcome the challenge to a conviction he called ‘a complete travesty’.
