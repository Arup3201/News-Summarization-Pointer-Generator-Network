A bride paid a heartwarming tribute to a late family member - when she arrived at the church in her grandfather's potato delivery van.

Elizabeth Hinksman, 27, opted for the unusual mode of transport to the church for her nuptials to husband Andrew Williams, 29, in honour of her late grandfather Geoff who died in 2009.

The mother-of-one was chauffeur-driven in the white delivery truck from her home to St Paul's Church, in the village of Tupsley, Herefordshire, on December 22 by her proud father Darryl.

The alternative wedding vehicle was previously used by Darryl's father for his business 'Geoff Hinksman Potatoes' - which has been in the family for 32 years.

Elizabeth said she wanted to pay tribute to her grandfather - who died aged 80 - by arriving at the ceremony in his trusty van.

Elizabeth, a business support manager, said: 'My granddad was taken to his funeral on the back of one of his vans and it really lightened the mood.

'I knew then I wanted to do the same for my wedding as he couldn't be there. This way he kind of was.

'I wanted to make people laugh and it sure worked - I don't think many people turn up to their wedding in a spud van.

'I used to work with cars when I was employed by Ford and my husband does every day so the idea of a car didn't appeal to us. We wanted something that little bit different.

'Everybody seemed to love it. It was a wonderful day.'

Father Darryl, 55, added: 'Everybody was loving it. It is a family business so it was a fitting way to pay tribute to my father.

'At his funeral she said that's what she wanted to do, so she's known for a while.

'The traffic was pretty bad driving through the middle of town as it was the last Saturday before Christmas so everybody was waving and clapping when they realised there was a bride on board.

'It was absolutely brilliant and made the day unique.'

Elizabeth and Andrew, a car salesman, will jet off on their honeymoon in the Maldives next Thursday.
