Hero of the far-Right: Rudolf Hess, whose remains have been removed from his grave, cremated and scattered

The grave of Adolf Hitler’s deputy has been dismantled to stop  neo-Nazis using it as a pilgrimage point.

Rudolf Hess’s remains were exhumed from the burial plot in a cemetery in the Bavarian town of Wunsiedel. They will be cremated and scattered at sea in a secret operation.

Hess, pictured, who was one of Hitler’s closest aides, committed suicide in 1987 while serving a life sentence in Berlin for crimes against peace. He was 93.

He had requested in his will to be buried in his family’s plot in Wunsiedel.

But in recent years he has come to be seen as a martyr by the far-Right and thousands of neo-Nazis have used the anniversary of his death on August 17 as an occasion to hold rallies in the town.

Despite  these being outlawed six years ago, the site and town continued to attract extremists.

Hess was an early confidant of Hitler, who dictated much of his infamous manifesto Mein Kampf to him while imprisoned during the 1920s.

He eventually rose to become deputy Nazi party leader, and was captured in 1941 during a solo flight to Scotland on an apparently unauthorised peace mission.

Born to a wealthy Bavarian family, Hess spent his first 14 years in Egypt before going to Germany to finish his education and begin a career as a merchant.

At the outbreak of the First World War, Hess enlisted in the German infantry. He was wounded on several occasions and was awarded the Iron Cross, second class, for his exploits.

Hess first heard Adolf Hitler speak at a Munich rally in 1920. He became devoted to Hitler and joined the fledgling Nazi Party as one of its first members.

After Hitler assumed dictatorial powers in early 1933, Hess was named 'Deputy to the Fuhrer'. On 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, Hitler announced that should anything happen to both him and Hermann Göring, Hess would be next in the line of succession.

Like Goebbels, Hess was privately distressed by the war with Britain because he had hoped it would accept Germany as an ally.

On May 10, 1941, Hess took off from Augsburg in a Messerschmitt Bf 110. After reaching the west coast of England he turned east before climbing and parachuting over Renfrewshire and he landed at Floors Farm near Eaglesham.

Winston Churchill initially sent Hess to the Tower of London, making him the last prisoner to be held in the 900-year-old fortress. Hess was detained by the British for the remainder of the war.

After the end of the war, Hess was tried at Nuremberg alongside other Nazi leaders. He was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against peace but told the tribunal, 'I regret nothing.'

Following the release in 1966 of Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer, Hess was the sole remaining inmate of Spandau Prison, partly at the insistence of the Soviets.

On 17 August 1987, Hess died at the age of 93. He was found in a summer house in a garden located in a secure area of the prison with an electrical cord wrapped around his neck.

His death was controversially ruled a suicide by asphyxiation. Spandau Prison was subsequently demolished to prevent it from becoming a shrine.

Hess was the last surviving member of Hitler's cabinet.

He was later convicted in the Nuremberg trials after the Second World War ended.

His relatives and the Lutheran church which runs the cemetery agreed it was best to remove his  remains from the site.

‘The grave is now empty,’ cemetery administrator Andreas Fabel confirmed yesterday. 
Holocaust survivors welcomed the move.

‘There is now one less place of 
evil in the world,’ said Elan Steinberg of the New  York-based American 
Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants.

German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung said the descendants of Hess were 
  initially against the idea of exhuming his body.

A granddaughter of Hess even filed 
  a law suit to prevent it.

But the family eventually caved in to pressure from the local authorities and agreed to have his remains taken away.

However, according to Fabel, with the lease on the burial plot 
coming up for renewal in October, Hess’s relatives and Lutheran church 
authorities in the town decided it was best to remove the remains.

'Both sides were in favour of it,' he added.

Hess was an early confidant of Hitler, and, while Hitler was imprisoned in the 1920s, the Nazi leader dictated much of his infamous manifesto Mein Kampf, or My Struggle, to him.

Hess eventually rose to the position of deputy Nazi party leader, but by 1941 his influence with Hitler was waning.

His flight to Scotland is widely seen by historians as an attempt to restore his importance.

Instead, Hitler said he was delusional and the British treated him as a prisoner of war.

The Fuhrer then sacked Hess and ordered him to be shot if he ever returned to Germany.

He appointed Martin Boorman as his new deputy.

At the Nuremberg trials after the war, Hess was found innocent of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against peace and conspiracy to commit crimes against peace.

Hess was the last inmate at Spandau Prison in then-West Berlin when he died on August 17, 1987 at the age of 93.

Allied authorities said he hanged himself with an electrical cord.

The prison was demolished shortly afterwards and the rubble secretly disposed of.

Many far-Right groups say Hess did not commit suicide but was killed by British military guards in prison, and conspiracy theories about the Nazi, who was interested in the occult, abound.
