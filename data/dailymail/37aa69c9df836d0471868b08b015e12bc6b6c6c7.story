More than 50 firefighters tackled four blazes in Brampton and one in Offord Cluny within two hours, where cottages can cost up to £600,000.

Five thatched cottages were set alight in the early hours of yesterday morning. More than 50 firefighters were called to deal with the spate of arson attacks in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire

Arsonists struck at four properties in Brampton and one in Offord, putting the lives of families in danger

They were called to tackle a blaze at a thatched cottage in Offord Cluny at around 12.37am and another crew was sent to a fire in Brampton at 1.10am.

Just 10 minutes later another emergency call was received to The Green in Brampton and firefighters were alerted to two more blazes at thatched cottages nearby.

Police are now looking for two men, both white and aged 25 to 30, who they believe are responsible.

One was 6ft 4in to 6ft 6in tall, of thin build and wearing a dark hooded top and dark trousers.

And the second man was shorter, of stocky build and with brown wavy hair. He was wearing a grey hooded top and black trousers.

The men are believed to have been travelling in a red hatchback with a loud exhaust.

Detective Sergeant Iain Moor from Cambridgeshire Police said: 'These fires were extremely dangerous and it is fortunate that no-one was seriously injured or killed.

'Thankfully, the fires were spotted quickly and put out before they could take hold and cause serious damage.'

Det Sgt Moor said: 'I would urge anyone who knows who was responsible, or who recognises the descriptions, to call police.'

A mother-of-three has told how she and her family were woken by firefighters after arsonists set fire to her home's thatched roof in Brampton.

Vhari Russell, 36, was evacuated with her husband Pete, eight-year-old daughter Emily, four-year-old Grace and two-year-old Olivia.

'I can't even begin to see why anyone would want to set fire to someone's house,' said Mrs Russell.

'The ramifications of their funny prank were that five people could have lost their homes and even their families.

'I woke up to find a fire engine just outside the back window. It was extremely lucky because they spotted it as they were on the way to another fire. They were remarkable, they wouldn't leave until they were sure the fire was completely out. If they hadn't seen the fire, it would be a very different story.'

Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Commander Rick Hylton said: 'We are urging residents - and especially those with thatched properties - to be vigilant to any suspicious activity and ensure you have a working smoke alarm.'
