A furious Roy Keane tried to confront Tom Cleverley over claims that bust-ups with players had led to his departure from Aston Villa.

Keane went round to Cleverley’s Cheshire house on Tuesday, pressed the doorbell and waited for 15 minutes.

There was no answer from the house and eventually Keane — who lives nearby — stomped off. The incident was reported to have been captured on Cleverley’s CCTV.

Keane left Aston Villa at the end of last month saying he could not combine his role with his Ireland job

Keane quit his role as manager Paul Lambert’s assistant last month saying he could not combine working for Villa and the Republic of Ireland, for whom he is No 2 to Martin O’Neill.

Lambert revealed he spoke to Keane on Wednesday night. Asked whether Keane was unhappy about these stories, the manager said: ‘No. I spoke to Roy. We’re good pals and that will always be the same. I think if Roy took a strand from his beard it would be a story. There’s no issue.’

The Villa manager also had a brief conversation with Cleverley. ‘I spoke to Tom and he assured me that contrary to reports it never happened the way it was portrayed in the papers,’ said Lambert.

‘Tom was relaxed. He had a laugh. No problem.’

Keane was spotted back in the public eye at Goodison Park watching Everton against QPR
