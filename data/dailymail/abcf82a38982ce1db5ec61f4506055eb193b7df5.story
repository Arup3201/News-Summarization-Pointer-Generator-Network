The husband of the second American aid worker recently diagnosed with Ebola and returned to the U.S. has said he is astonished at the reactions of people who are critical of the couple for putting themselves in danger.

David Writebol, who remains in Liberia, made the comments in a recorded phone conversation with Bruce Johnson, president of aid group SIM USA.

Writebol's wife, Nancy, was the second of two American aid workers to be flown to Atlanta for treatment at Emory University Hospital.

She arrived on Tuesday and is being treated in a highly specialized isolation unit, along with Dr. Kent Brantly, who arrived on Saturday.

The two were infected with Ebola while working at a missionary clinic outside Liberia's capital.

‘It's just astonishing to see the reaction of people, and I think it exposes the underlying philosophy and worldview of the age where ...an individual is really of no account and when someone goes to extraordinary lengths and measures to minister to and perhaps help an individual then that's looked down upon,’ he said.

David Writebol said he was also thankful for the ‘marvelous’ care his wife received in Liberia before traveling to Atlanta and is grateful that she is now in a place where she can receive the best care possible.

Johnson said on Tuesday that SIM USA is working to make arrangements to bring David Writebol back to the U.S. so he can be with his family.
