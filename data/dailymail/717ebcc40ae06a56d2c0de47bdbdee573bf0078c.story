With the average woman's make-up bag now totting up to a staggering £220, one cosmetic company has set about helping women achieve the flawless look for a fraction of the price.

Makeup Revolution is a 300 piece collection of make-up priced between £1-£12 that promises to match high-end products on variety and quality.

The range, which has just launched at Superdrug and consists of shadow palettes, lip glosses, nail varnishes and eye foils, claims to contain formulas, ingredients and durability equal to the prestige brands.

Cheap vs expensive: Jane, pictured, left, wearing expensive products and, right, wearing Makeup revolution, said this experiment has made her really wonder just how much over the odds we're paying for products that work no better than their cheaper counterparts

Clare Ray, GMTV's beauty expert, who 
worked on the launch, said of the range: 'Makeup Revolution is a 
professional quality range which delivers results that could be compared
 to products triple the price such as The One Foundation which includes 
Perfector Technology and is available in 16 shades - both a first on the
 high street.'

The 
complexion perfector technology claims to adapt to the intrinsic tone 
and texture of the skin to give an instant flawless finish with no 
build-up. Apparently the first to the mass market, it promises to 
deliver blendable, full matte coverage that naturally enhances the 
skin's radiance.

One
 of the £4 foundation's key selling points is that it has been developed
 in 16 bespoke shades to micro-match the nation's skin tones.

The
 brand also claims to bring the first mass market eye shadow foils, 
inspired by the latest in make-up trends as seen on the runway, to the 
beauty sphere for £5.

Makeup
 Revolution also names its 'hero product' as a 12 shade eye palette, 
which costs £4 - good value compared to other brands priced at around 
£36.

Anna Wintours' make-up
 artist, Nariman Pouranpir, who attended the launch, is a fan. She said:
 'Wonderful collection of vast products which I would certainly keep in 
my kit. Astounded by the on-trend colours.'

A beauty look for £12: Makeup Revolution is a new range of cosmetics priced between £1-£12 that promises to match prestige brands on quality. British Beauty Blogger Jane Cunningham tests it

High-end look: Jane shows off the results of her designer beauty products, a look that sets her back £156

Jane Cunningham, a beauty writer and 
editor of Britishbeautyblogger.com, one of the original UK beauty blogs 
that gives beauty news and no-holds barred reviews, helped FEMAIL put Makeup Revolution to the test.

As
 a beauty blogger, Jane says she is 'certainly no beauty snob because 
I’m game for testing make-up at all price-points', but that she's definitely settled into preferring luxury and high-end products for 
personal use.

She 
said: 'I’ve tried and tested enough make-up to know that budget brands 
have upped their game and there isn’t the same disparity in quality that
 there used to be.'

Testing Makeup Revolution, however, has been a budget revelation for Jane; in the pictures below on the right she's wearing designer make-up that costs £156, and in the other, on the left, make-up from Makeup Revolution that costs £14.

'Budget beauty brands often aim at younger girls who naturally have less disposable income, but in the case of Makeup Revolution it’s suitable for all age groups, regardless,' she said.

On her eyes she used Redemption Palette Iconic 1, £4, containing twelve eye shadows; a mix of matte and shimmers for picture one and for picture two, she used Chanel Les 4 Ombres in Tisse Gabrielle with four shades that have a high sheen.

Cheap vs expensive: Jane, pictured, left, wearing Makeup Revolution and, right, wearing expensive products - can you tell the difference?

'I like to wear my eye-shadow dark and blending is often quite a challenge with blacks and greys, but with Redemption, it’s completely easy - in terms of faultless blendability, it outshone my Chanel colours. In terms of wear, there was no discernible difference between the two,' she said.

As foundation, she wore Estee Lauder Re-Nutriv in picture Two, costing £63. 'It’s my go-to foundation because it contains a hefty whack of anti-ageing ingredients and every little helps!,' she said.

'In picture one I used Makeup Revolution The One Foundation, and of all the Makeup Revolution products that I’ve put to the test, it’s the one I like least. You need to really shake the bottle to get it mixed and it’s rather runny. It gives very sheer coverage and personally, I feel I need a little more.

'However, if you’re blessed with flawless skin and love a natural look, then it’s worth £4 of anyone’s money,' she explained.

Value for money? Makeup Revolution, including £4 blushers and £4 foundation, is hoping to match its high-end competitors on quality

For lips, in picture two, she used Dior Lipstick, £26, which she described as 'beautifully creamy' and 'very luxurious', but in picture  one she used Amazing Care Lipstick #happylips from Makeup Revolution. 'There is no difference in feel or depth of colour and other than you may find you have to re-apply Makeup Revolution, £3, a little more often, it’s an easy wear and an incredible bargain,' she said of the product.

Jane cites her favourite Makeup Revolution item as the Vivid Cheek Lacquer, £3. She said: 'It’s high in pigment and blends very easily onto the cheeks for a pop of colour. In picture two I’m wearing YSL Babydoll Kiss & Blush, £27, a cheek and lip cream that’s also easy to blend and gives a healthy flush to my cheeks.

'However, I’d say you would be very pushed to tell the difference in performance both on colour pigment and longevity.

Cheap as chips: The new range, although mixed when it comes to quality, starts from just £1 at Superdrug

'If anything, the surprise isn’t that Makeup Revolution is such good value, it’s that the mark up on high-end products is no longer a secret. This experiment has made me really wonder just how much over the odds we’re paying for products that work no better than their cheaper counterparts.

'I’ve been using the Redemption palette for over two weeks now and I’m completely unable to tell the difference between that and the costly shadows I used to love.'

With recent research by Debenhams revealing that even if you go for high street names rather than high-end designer brands, the cost of your average basic make-up bag still adds up.

They found that the typical 
woman’s ‘everyday’ make-up bag in the UK contains 14 items; with mascara,
 eye liner and concealer the most prevalent products, and the most 
common brand names being Rimmel, Maybeline and Clinique so perhaps Makeup Revolution is on to a winner.

Team Femail also gave the products a 
whirl. We found The One Foundation to be near impossible to apply due to its 
watery consistency and for anyone looking to conceal blemishes and dark 
spots, the coverage wouldn't be enough.

If
 you suffer from any skin conditions or adult acne, we would advise 
avoiding the product and instead opt for Giorgio Armani's Luminous Silk Foundation, £35 - duly recommended by Dr Frances Prenna-Jones, who works her magic on Kate Moss and Louise Redknapp.

The eyeshadow was better but the accompanying brushes were very poor quality and made applying them challenging.

The
 nail varnishes, on the other hand, were a firm favourite. Available in a
 host of on-trend colours (we love the nude), they were easy to apply, 
glided on smoothly and had a good matte texture and some serious staying
 power - even without a base and top coat.

Lipsticks were as 
good as you'd expect for £1 and while they come with a lip gloss, which 
essentially feels like you're getting two for the price of one, we prefer MAC cosmetics when it comes to pigment, moisturising benefits and staying
 power.
