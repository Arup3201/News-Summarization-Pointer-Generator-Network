One Direction donated just under £2.1m - including the £600,000 they raised for an anti-bulling campaign in American schools.

John Low, chief executive of Charities Aid Foundation, said: ‘It’s very important and sends a message to a generation: that when you make money you help others.’

U2 frontman Bono worked with Sir Jonathan Ive of Apple to hold a charity auction and raised £8 for combating Aids - which the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation then matched.
