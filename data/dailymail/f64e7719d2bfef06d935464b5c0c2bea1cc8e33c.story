A mother was arrested after her young child called police on Monday.

Ashley McDaniel, 26, of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, was passed out in an Economy Inn motel room when her three-year-old called 911 saying he was unable to wake her.

When police arrived on the scene they found McDaniel and three other men, along with marijuana, methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia.

The other three were asleep, and when Wooley woke McDaniel, 26, up, she gave him permission to search the room. 

Police then found five grams of marijuana, methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia.

McDaniel was charged with child neglect and possession of marijuana; Fairbanks was charged with possession of a controlled substance; Wales was charged with possession of a controlled substance; and Yates, 32, was charged with possession of paraphernalia and also had an outstanding warrant.

All four were booked at the Ocean Springs jail and the child was placed into the custody of the Department of Human Services.
