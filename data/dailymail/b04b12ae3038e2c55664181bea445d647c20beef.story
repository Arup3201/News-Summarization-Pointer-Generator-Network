Armed raiders burst in to a pizza delivery shop demanding cash – and escaped with a safe which contained only 99p.

The masked men sneaked in to the shop, which is a part of a delivery-only chain, and threatened staff.

The workers were left shaken, but unharmed, by the raid.

The owner, who did not wish to be named, was in the shop at the time.

He said: ‘There was a couple of them armed with knives and an adjustable spanner.

‘They just wanted money and got away with the safe.’

He has increased security since the break-in on December 23, and only reopened The Fat Pizza on the Charfleets Industrial Estate, Canvey Island, Essex, earlier this week.

An Essex Police spokesman said that they were searching for two men who may have been seen loitering in the area and who left the scene in a dark vehicle.

Late last year, a prolific jewellery thief who snatched nearly a quarter of a million pounds worth of valuables from London shops was caught after leaving behind his mobile phone with a selfie as a screensaver at the scene of a crime.

Mechanic Germain Ibrahim Fofana, 27, who blew the money gambling in casinos, received five-and-a-half years imprisonment for a total of forty-five offences.

Police identified the New York-native, whose father is American and his mother from the Ivory Coast, from the 'selfie' picture on the screensaver of the phone he left at the scene of an £18,000 jewellery theft from Ernest Jones in Kingston-upon-Thames on May 18. 

He also pleaded guilty to burgling Baden Powell House hostel in Queensgate, South Kensington on January 7; February 20 and April 10. He stole luggage, cameras, an iPod, and an Apple Mac worth at least £1,580.

Fofana had asked for another twenty-six similar theft offences to be taken into consideration, plus five burglaries from London hostels and one burglary of a hotel.
