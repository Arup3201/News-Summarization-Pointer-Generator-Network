Federal officials 'warned' Sony that their planned film about an assassination attempt on North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un could provoke retaliation from the hermit state. 

It is claimed that officials in the Department of Homeland Security held a secret off-the-record briefing with senior executives from the film company about the comedy 'The Interview'. 

Sony has been the victim of a number of high profile cyber attacks in recent weeks with some of their movies leaked online, while confidential information on employees and stars has also been placed on the internet.

The comedy which features the planned assassination of Kim Jong Un will be released on Christmas Day 

However, North Korea has denied any involvement in the sophisticated cyber attack on Sony 

According to the Los Angeles Times  the Department of Homeland Security told Sony that the film could inflame tensions with North Korea.

However, both Sony and the Department of Homeland Security denied knowledge of any such meetings. 

Although, Federal investigators are currently investigating a string of cyber attacks on the entertainment company

North Korea has also denied any involvement on the attack on Sony. One New York based diplomat told Voice of America the story was 'another fabrication targeting the country. 

Cyber attackers breached Sony's computer network on November 24. 

North Korea has denied any involvement in the attack, despite their anger over Sony's planned movie 'The Interview'. 

Hackers released online several upcoming Sony movies including the family hit Annie. 

The personal details of thousands of employees were also released. 

Hackers also revealed the various aliases used by celebrities when they book into hotels to protect their anonymity. 

Dozens of highly embarrassing emails were released - including one which described Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'.   

'My country publicly declared that it would follow international norms banning hacking and piracy.' 

Sony Pictures is planning to release the film starring James Franco and Seth Rogen on Christmas Day. The pair play two American journalists who are hired by the CIA to kill the North Korean leader after they are granted an interview with him.  

The entertainment company's computer network was breached on November 24. The company does not yet know the extent of the information stolen, although are series of highly embarrassing emails and documents have been leaked online. 

Cyber security experts believe the company could be hit with costs in excess of seven figures. 

FBI Director James Comey admitted the investigation has still to identify who is responsible for the attack. 

He said: 'Anything cyber is very complicated, tracing back malware and signatures especially," Comey told reporters at a briefing. It is complicated business and I want to make sure before we make an attribution that I have high confidence in it.... I'm not prepared to attribute it to any particular actor.'

The attack on Sony is believed to the be the worst of its type on a company on U.S. soil. 

Jim Lewis, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the breach could have a longer term impact on the company's reputation. 

He said: 'Usually, people get over it, but it does have a short-term effect.' 

In one of the highly embarrassing emails leaked by the hackers, Hollywood producer Scott Rudin, right, described Angelina Jolie, left, as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat'  

Mr Lewis admitted the attack could cost the company in the region of $100 million.   

Mark Rasch, a former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, estimated costs could run up to $70 million.

Losses in that range would not mean a big financial setback to Sony Pictures Entertainment, which reported operating profit of $501 million for the fiscal year through March.

But other effects, such as the loss of trade secrets, will be difficult to measure, Rasch said. Hackers have released a trove of documents that include contracts and marketing plans that could influence competitors' strategies.

Costs could mount if Hollywood stars, producers or financiers decide to take projects to Sony's competitors.

He said: 'Will they be able to attract high-name stars if those stars believe their personal information will not be protected?

'How do you know what business opportunities are lost? It's hard to put a dollar figure on it.'
