A teenager is so petrified of being sick that she refuses to be further than 100 yards from a toilet.

Anna Roberts, 19, from Southwick, West Sussex, suffers from the phobia so severely that she must be near a toilet at all times.

The phobia, known as emetophobia, has left Miss Roberts living in constant fear of vomiting and unable to lead a normal life.

Anna Roberts has such a severe phobia of vomiting that she refuses to be more than 100 years from a toilet

She rarely leaves the house, has no job, and finds it difficult to socialise with friends due to her crippling phobia.

She said: ‘I’m so terrified of being sick that if I ever go out I can’t cope unless I know I’m near a toilet at all times.

‘I always feel nauseous - the feeling just overwhelms me.

‘I don’t like the thought of other people’s sick but my worst nightmare would be to throw up in public.

‘I feel safest in my own toilet at home - but if a family member is sick in the bathroom I will avoid using that toilet for over a month.’

Despite only being sick once every few years, Miss Robert’s life is completely controlled by the fear.

The phobia - known as emetophobia - is so severe that Miss Roberts rarely leaves the house and is unable to work. She also struggles to socialise with her friends because of her anxieties

She said: ‘I’m so scared of being sick so I try to make sure everything is clean and germ free so I won’t get ill.

‘I clean cutlery and dishes all of the time, I will only eat food that is so overcooked it’s burnt and I don’t really like to try new food just in case I have a bad reaction.

Emetophobia is the phobia of vomit.

It is a common anxiety disorder that is most common in women.

Up to three per cent of men and seven per cent of women are thought to have emetophobia.

People with the phobia fear being sick, especially in public, so often practice avoidance behaviours.

For example, some sufferers will not leave home when there is a tummy bug going around and will avoid friends or family who are ill.

Others will observe a strict diet that is free from anything that might cause a stomach upset.

Some avoid medications which list nausea as a potential side effect.

Others avoid pregnancy and alcohol for fear they could make them vomit.

Treatment options include counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy and medication.

‘I really want to pass my driving test but I feel car sick and I can’t concentrate as I don’t know where the nearest toilet is.

‘My friendship circle is constantly shrinking as I rarely go out and I can never visit my boyfriend’s house as I worry that I might become poorly.’

Miss Robert’s phobia started at the age of 11 when she had a sickness bug just before Christmas.

She was ill for more than two weeks and frantically worried she wouldn’t get better in time for the festivities.

She said: ‘I was only young and Christmas - like all children - was my favourite time of year.

‘But after being ill I was so scared that it would come back and I would miss the big day.

‘I don’t enjoy Christmas anymore, it just reminds me of throwing up.

‘After that I went through a phase where I would even take my own food to eat when my family made me go to restaurants.

‘Being at school helped as my mind was constantly distracted and although there were still days where I felt sick I had no choice but to be there and get on with it.

‘But since I’ve left college my phobia has consumed me, being at home in my room all of the time has meant my fears of going outside are much worse.’

Miss Roberts has been to counselling but so far nothing has helped her to successfully conquer her fears.

She said: ‘My dream is to be able to go on holiday and relax and not constantly fret over being sick.

Miss Roberts is so afraid of germs that she cleans obsessively and insists that all of her food is overcooked

‘I hope to become a make-up artist one day, but of course that would mean leaving the house and being around lots of different people.

‘It just controls me so much, it’s terrifying.’

David Samson, a clinical hypnotherapist who specialises in phobia treatment, said: ‘Emetophobia primarily affects females. I treat around seven females for every male.

‘Most commonly it starts around the 
early teens with fussy eating, obsessive checking of sell-by dates on 
food products, reluctance to eat away from home, fears of social 
situations, inability to attend school regularly, frequent tummy 
sensations and a general feeling of being unsafe when not at home.

Miss Roberts has had counselling but it did not help her to overcome her phobia

‘Recovery is gradual and the symptoms can take from several months to many years to fully disappear.

‘It is not a smooth path either - patients will have a few good days followed by a “blip” when they feel they have got worse.

‘This is an essential part of the recovery process as they learn what the “tummy feeling” is and realise that it isn’t always bad.

‘Believe it or not, this is one of the most common phobias and whilst there are no official stats, some rank it to be around the fifth top in the world.’
