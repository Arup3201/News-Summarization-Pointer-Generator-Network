A lorry driver was killed when his vehicle crashed into a busy Royal British Legion club in a market town while members enjoyed a festive drink inside.

Paramedics rushed to the social club but the man, who had been delivering milk, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash.

Emergency services were called to Wednesbury in Sandwell, West Midlands, around 8pm last night after the 40ft lorry collided with the side of the building.

Wreckage: Debris from the Boxing Day crash which happened at around 9pm last night in Wednesbury, in the West Midlands

Accident: The crash happened in Wednesbury, West Midlands, last night. It was not clear what caused the collision

The 25 Boxing Day drinkers and staff 
inside the club walked away from the crash site unharmed, although they 
were evacuated when the lorry hit, a police spokesman 
said.

Other than the driver, no injuries were reported.

People who were in the club at the time thought there had been a gas explosion when the lorry crashed.

Bar manager Terry Fitzgerald, 65, was working when he heard a loud bang, his wife and daughter were also in the bar.

He said: 'Everyone who was inside is so lucky to be alive, it is a miracle no one in there was hurt.

'I heard a bang and thought it was a bomb or a gas explosion, then I heard hissing.

'I later found out the hissing was the air brakes from the truck and we didn't notice what had happened until we all ran outside to see the truck sticking out.

'This is a devastating thing to happen, especially because someone has lost their life. No-one seems to know the man, there was just so much smoke and I am still in shock.

'I am just relieved my family are okay, it is tragic that a man has died but it could have led to 30 people dying.'

Club secretary Linda Holl, 64, said: 'The children in there were terrified, everyone went there to celebrate Boxing Day and have a drink together.

'The damage is catastrophic. I have no
 idea when we will be back up and running. The lorry hit the right hand 
side of the club, there was aa family standing on the left, if they 
would have been on the other side they'd be dead.

'There is a dual carriageway outside and the speed limit is around 30 to 40mph, although no one has any idea how he crashed.'

It is believed the club opened in the 1930s and recently, new windows and a new boiler system had been installed.

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'Crews we called to 
reports of a lorry that had been in a significant collision with a 
building.

'On arrival at the scene crews found that the lorry had 
collided into the Royal British Legion with approximately a third of the
 lorry's length within the building.

'Ambulance crews worked 
alongside the fire service, whilst they secured the building, to ensure 
that everyone that had been in the property at the time of the incident 
were accounted for and were uninjured.

'On assessment of the lorry 
driver it unfortunately became apparent that nothing could be done to 
save him and he was sadly confirmed deceased at the scene.'

The roads around the scene remained cordoned off last night while the vehicle was recovered and emergency services worked to ensure the building was made safe.Â 

Specialist police collision investigators were also examining the crash site as they searched for clues as to what had caused the collision.

Officers were this morning working to 
identify the lorry driver, who was the only occupant of the vehicle at 
the time of the crash, and inform his family of the tragedy.

West Midlands Police were also appealing for witnesses to contact the force.

A spokesman said: 'The British Legion was open at the time and customers
 were evacuated as a precaution, however no injuries have been reported.'

Drivers
 also faced disruption on the M2 in Kent this morning following a 
serious accident near the Medway Bridge between junction three at 
Chatham and junction two at Strood.
