Critical condition: Aimee Copeland is battling for life in intensive care after contracting a flesh-eating bug that forced doctors to amputate her leg

Just over a week ago, 24-year-old Aimee Copeland was kayaking down a creek in Carrollton, Georgia when she stopped to ride a home-made zipline. The line snapped, and she suffered a gash to her left calf.

Now Miss Copeland is fighting for her life in hospital, after horrified doctors realised an aggressive flesh-eating bacteria had invaded the wound.

Medics were forced to amputate the young woman's leg on Friday night, and she remains in a critical condition at the JMS Burn Center in Augusta.

Doctors have put her chances of survival as 'slim to none,' according to a message her devastated father posted on Facebook.

Andy Copeland told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that his daughter, who is a graduate psychology student at the University of West Georgia, attended the emergency room at Tanner Medical Center in Carrollton after cutting her leg.

Doctors there closed the wound with 22 staples, and told her to take Motrin and Tylenol for the pain.

The next day, she returned complaining of severe pain and was given a prescription for painkillers.

Her father said this alleviated her symptoms, but the pain continued to build on Thursday.

'Aimee went to the doctor and received a prescription for antibiotics and posted a clean MRI report,' he said. 'Again, she was treated and released.'

On Friday morning the student was driven to the emergency room by a concerned friend. Pale and weak, she received a shocking diagnosis: She was suffering from necrotizing fasciitis, a rare flesh-eating bacteria that can destroy skin, fat and muscle.

Physicians told the young woman the infection had already spread to her thigh and hip, and that her whole leg would have to be amputated.

Miss Copeland was flown to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, where doctors performed a high-hip amputation of her left leg and removed further infected tissue from her abdomen.

'The surgeons advised me that they wanted to try to save her leg, but at this point saving her life took precedence,' Mr Copeland said on Facebook.

'They removed all of the infected tissue and advised that she would have limited, if any use of her leg.'

'Aimee [cardiac] arrested when they moved her from the operating table, but they were able to successfully resuscitate her,' he added.

Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery

Though she initially made progress, her father believes Miss Copeland may be deteriorating.

Yesterday, her organs were said to be shutting down and her temperature was 102.  

Mr Copeland is hoping and praying that his daughter will survive her appalling ordeal.

He described her as 'a lover of people,' who had majored in psychology because she wanted to help people through their own traumas. 

Writing on Facebook on 6 May, he concluded: 'I type this factual progression of Aimee’s condition as a way to better cope with what is without a doubt the most horrific situation that a parent can possibly imagine.

'We take so much for granted in life, but I never imagined that one of my daughters would face this most unlikely of situations.

'I hope and pray that when you read this that the news we receive at sunrise will be positive. At this point, no news is good news, but all I know to do is hope and pray for the best. I only ask that you all do the same.'

The JMS Burn Center in Augusta, where Aimee is receiving vital medical care

Friends and co-workers from the Sunnyside Cafe in Carrollton, where Miss Copeland works, have banded together to support her family. 

WSBTV quoted a friend, Kara Dermo, who said, 'She was awesome, just great ... just really awesome to be around.'

Miss Copeland is well-known in Carrollton, where she had organised festivals and activities.

Sunnyside cafe owner Gary Duke said: 'She planned to go to work helping troubled youth. Then all the sudden, this devastating accident.'

A website for psychology students at the University of West Virginia said of the brave young woman:

'About Aimee: Bright star, lover of life, infinitely generous of heart and spirit. From Snellville, GA. B.A. from UGA in 2010. Nearing completion of her Master’s degree at UWG Psychology. Loved dearly by family and friends.'

Miss Copeland's friends have established Aimee's Fund at the United Community Bank in Carrollton, with the aim of raising money for her rehabilitation. Details are available on the student page dedicated to Miss Copeland. 

They also plan to hold a blood drive in the university's gym from 2 to 7pm on May 15.

Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection.

'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat.

The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea.

Organ failure and shock are also common complications.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue.    

Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.
