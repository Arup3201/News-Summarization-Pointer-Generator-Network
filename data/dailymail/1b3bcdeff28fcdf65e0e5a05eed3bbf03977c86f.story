A waitress who claims her boss paid her to entertain a cop celebrating his 49th birthday has accused the detective of rape.

The 36-year-old waitress, had 
only worked for Parrilla restaurant on Broadway and 164th street for one week.

She claims she was given 
$200 and told to entertain the birthday boy and his three cop pals who were there having a long, boozy dinner break, despite all of them being on duty.

Parrilla: The steakhouse where four cops are accused of having had a long boozy dinner break. No charges have been filed.

She
told the New York Daily News that she ended up joining the party: drinking 
wine and downing shots, before one of the cops coaxed her away from the 
table and into a back room which had a bed in it.

She
said: ‘The last thing I remember is him patting the bed and telling me 
to sit down next to him. He was trying to kiss me and I was trying to 
ward off his advances.

‘I 
remember trying to slide away from him, bob and weave. He was like, 
"Come here, everything’s all right. I’m not gonna hurt you."'

Victim: The waitress claims she may have been assaulted by one of the cops after being plied with drink.

The waitress awoke, naked, being pawed at by her boss. It was around 3am and she grabbed her clothes before fleeing the restaurant.

Confused about what had happened she said she rang the detective later that day, having 
already stored his number in her phone when she sent him a photo of 
herself the night before.

He
told her they had undressed but stopped short of having sex because she
was too drunk. He confessed to having taken her panties and later 
returned them to her in a plastic bag.

The four New York Police Department officers from the 33rd Precinct have been suspended after an investigation was launched into their behaviour.

Surveillance footage is being studied to
try to identify whether the cop may have paid the waitress for sex, or 
sexually assaulted her.

Two of the officers were seen leaving the restaurant for some time with one having clocked off duty by the time they returned.

The waitress was given a rape examination at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital but the results have not yet been processed.

Suspended: Four NYPD cops have been stripped of their guns and badges following allegations of rape and drinking on the job at Parrilla Steakhouse in Washington Heights

An NYPD spokesperson told the New York Times: ‘Several hundred dollars may have exchanged hands, and the owner is maybe an intermediary.’

The
restaurant owner was unavailable for comment but his lawyer, Solomon J.
Schepps, said: ‘I don’t think there will be any wrongdoing proven 
against the restaurant, or any of its owners.’
