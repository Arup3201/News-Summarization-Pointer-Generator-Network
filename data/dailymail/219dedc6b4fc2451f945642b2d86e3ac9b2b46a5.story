These extraordinary pictures capture one of Britain's rarest animals - an albino squirrel.

The red-eyed rodent was glimpsed by wildlife enthusiast Patrick Sullivan, 66, in a park near his home almost three months ago.

But despite regularly stalking the woodland he was never able to capture the rare animal on camera.

Spotted: The red-eyed rodent was glimpsed by wildlife enthusiast Patrick Sullivan, 66, in a park near his home almost three months ago but he didn't spot it again until the other day

The pensioner spent days re-stocking his bird feeder only to be greeted by half a dozen of the animals' grey cousins.

Disappointed Mr Sullivan was about to give up on ever tracking down the rare animal, but last week his luck changed.

He glanced outside to check on his bird feeder and was stunned to see the red-eyed albino squirrel staring back at him.

The former publisher said he was delighted to have finally caught the animal on film.

Mr Sullivan, from East Grinstead, Sussex, said: 'When we saw the white squirrel a few months ago darting through the trees, we couldn't believe our eyes.

Rare: Mr Sullivan said the squirrel is more nervous that other squirrels so the picture was quite difficult to take

'We thought, 'That can't be right'. They jump around, but they are gone in a flash.

'We've seen him a few times since then, so when we put in a bird feeder we were pleasantly surprised to see him visit.

'He is a lot more nervous than the other squirrels, so it was not easy to get the picture. The feeder is mainly for the birds, but I'm a nature lover and I'm happy to see him.'

Though relatively uncommon, the rare creatures can be seen in a few parts of the South East, and the British Wildlife Centre, in Newchapel, has its own resident albino squirrel.

Liza Lipscombe, from the British Wildlife Centre in Newchapel, Surrey, said: 'It's not just squirrels that can be albinos.

'Bank voles, badgers and even white blackbirds are not unknown in this area.

'Albinos have quite a tough time in the wild, losing any natural benefits of camouflage, or they may be rejected by others of their kind.

'But as they are tree-dwelling and very quick on their feet, squirrels have very few natural predators and albino squirrels often survive as long as the grey ones.

'Our squirrel was cared for by Folly Wildlife Rescue, near Tonbridge, and is now too tame to release, and has been given a permanent home here.'
