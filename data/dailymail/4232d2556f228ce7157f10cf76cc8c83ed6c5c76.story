A Church of England vicar has left his congregation all shook up after quitting his job - to become an Elvis Presley impersonator.

The Reverend Andy Kelso, 64, ditched his dog collar to wear a high collar and jewelled white jump suit after saying he had a calling from God.

Now, the father of five has been dubbed 'Elvis Priestly' after he stopped preaching from the pulpit to belt out The King’s classics to other churches, packed-out pubs, clubs and old folks homes near his former vicarage.

And despite his amazing career switch, the Rev Kelso’s Elvis Gospel Tribute Act has become a heavenly hit with his former congregation at Christ Church in Matchborough, near Redditch, Worcestershire.

The Rev Kelso - married to hospice nurse Charmian, 62 - said: 'I think people don’t realise that Elvis loved his gospel songs so much.

'My whole desire is to build bridges with people and Elvis, I believe, is a fantastic link.

'I see it as a form of reaching out to people, using the king of rock ‘n’ roll to introduce people to Jesus, hopefully in a way that will be fun.'

The Rev Kelso, a grandfather of six whose children are in their 20s and 30s, decided on his career path as an Elvis impersonator last year.

He said: 'One day I was out walking the dogs in between church services and I felt God say to me very strongly: 'Take Elvis to the Church.

'It was a shock but after one concert there was a lot of interest from churches who wanted to connect with their communities and my tribute act seems to connect.

'When I play, the venues are packed out and I’ve not looked back since.'

He has had some colourful experiences since making his unorthodox career switch.

After a recent gig in Worcester he missed a turning and was stopped by police when he did a U-turn.

He said: 'The traffic cops asked what I’d been doing and I told them I’d been doing an Elvis tribute act in the church - but they asked if I’d been drinking and I said, "Hardly - It’s a Methodist church!"

'Eventually they let me go.'

His new job is a far cry from his role as vicar, but he admitted that he was an unlikely candidate for the church when he was recruited in the 1970s.

He said: 'Let’s just say God has a sense of humour.

'I spent 25 years doing the one thing I vowed I never would - being a vicar.

'Now people who wouldn’t normally come to church are coming to a great evening out with some food for thought.'

The Rev Kelso’s typical two-hour set showcases the best of Elvis’s career, including his rock, pop and gospel hits.

The Scarborough-born preacher has been asked to perform at the Pershore Plum Festival in Worcestershire on August Bank Holiday Monday.

He sometimes sings at wedding receptions and opens fetes - often arriving in style in a vintage Rolls-Royce or on the back of a Honda 1500cc Goldwing motorcycle.

The Rev Kelso said: 'I sing the songs, then I tell a little about Elvis’s spiritual journey and link it in with mine. People listen and really take it on board. I go wherever I am asked.

'I recently went to a care home where most of the patients had dementia.

'I was wondering how I would go down, but as soon as I appeared as Elvis and started singing the residents came alive and started singing and dancing. It was amazing and very humbling.'

He added: 'When you listen to Elvis’ gospel songs, they’re just so from the heart and they really seem to speak to people.

'It’s true that for many years he went far away from his Christian roots but he never stopped believing the basics of Christianity.

'The break-up of his marriage affected him deeply and led to his slide into prescription drugs and junk food but these troubled years also led him to sing more gospel songs.'

The Rev Kelso tuned in to the church after he had a near-fatal 75mph motorcycle accident at 19 which caused him to pray for the first time in his life.

He intially studied drama before joining the Christian Arts Project, launched by Cliff Richard, where he formed his own theatre company that toured the country.

He joined the Church of England as a vicar in 1985 and is now chaplain to Worcester Warriors Rugby Club.
