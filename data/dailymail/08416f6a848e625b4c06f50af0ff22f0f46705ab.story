A couple who used 'black magic' to convince an 11-year-old girl to take part in sex sessions where they sucked her blood have been jailed for 34 years.

Carolee Hickman, 64, from St Athan, South Wales, told the schoolgirl that she was part of a powerful witches' coven before forcing her to have sex with her husband Albert, 65.

The victim had repressed memories of the abuse, which took place between 1972 and 1975, until they came back during counselling for bereavement and depression in 2011.

She told Cardiff Crown Court last month that Mrs Hickman had a special 'bejewelled knife', which she used to cut the young girl's thumb before sucking her blood.

The court heard the couple invited the teenage girl into their house where they discussed black magic and did tarot card readings with her.

Mrs Hickman would threaten to kill her mother, who was suffering from cancer at the time, with a curse.

The Hickman's then assaulted the girl every week for almost a year, and together planned to rape the young victim.

Mrs Hickman pinned her arms above her head and took 'delight in the terrible, terrible rape' carried out by her husband. 

The victim, who cannot be identified, said the horror of what happened to her while at school had been buried for 40 years - before her memories resurfaced.

Now in her 50s, she said in an impact statement: '42-years-ago a little girl met two evil people who took advantage of her.

'My life has been destroyed at their hands.'

The woman said she went to the Hickman's, who now live in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, house aged 11 while skipping school with friends.

The couple allegedly gave the girl and her friends 'pagan crosses' to wear before plying them with cigarettes and alcohol.

She told a trial: 'Carolee said she was a witch and would come and get me and would make my mother ill - she even said she could kill my mother if she wanted to.

'She had a knife with a jewelled handle kept in a wooden box with carvings on the top. She cut my hand and sucked the blood out of it.

'There were tarot cards she used to tell our fortunes and she even had a black cape.'

Cardiff Crown Court (above) heard at an earlier hearing how Carolee, 64, used 'black magic' to force the girl into submission while her husband repeatedly raped her

The girl tried to report the Hickmans to police following the sex attack at their home near Cardiff but officers dismissed her claims, taking the view that a married woman would not have been capable of doing what Mrs Hickman had.

Passing sentence at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court today, Judge Daniel William said: 'You were a couple united by a deep seated and overwhelming abuse of children.

'You groomed her and gained her trust, you told her you had supernatural powers and that she was the "chosen one" and you put the fear of god into her.

'It was a specific targeting of a vulnerable victim and threats were made which petrified her.'

Hickman, who used to work as an engineer for the RAF, was given a 17-year sentence and his wife was found guilty of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape and given a matching 17 years. 

The court heard that Mr Hickman had raped a young girl in 1982 after leaving the RAF and joining the Fire Service and had been jailed for 10 years for the crime.

The jury was also told Mrs Hickman was jailed for five years in 1982 after admitting holding down a child while she was raped as part of 'devil worship' which required a virgin girl.

Judge Williams said of the victim: 'Your claims were dismissed without proper investigation.

'Had you been taken seriously it may have prevented the abuse which the Hickmans carried out in the 1980s.'

The judge also said the woman had shown tremendous courage in coming forward and giving evidence in the Hickmans' trial.
