Domestic violence and women's rights advocacy groups have attacked Conde Nast after Vogue Hommes International released its latest cover featuring Stephanie Seymour being choked by model Marlon Teixeira.

The publisher's chairman Si Newhouse and editorial director Thomas Wallace received a letter from four organization leaders accusing the 'disturbing' image of 'glorifying violence against women as an act of love.'

Asking Conde Nast to pull the 
magazine from New York newsstands immediately, Sanctuary for Families, Safe Horizon, Equality Now, and the New York chapter of NOW wrote: 'Choking is not a fashion statement, and certainly not something that 
should be used to sell magazines.'

Fashion statement: Domestic Violence and women's rights advocacy groups have accused the 'disturbing' image of 'glorifying violence against women as an act of love'

According to media blog Romenesko, the letter aimed to express the organizations' 'profound opposition' to the photo.

They wrote: 'This truly disturbing image of a woman being choked sends a dangerous 
message to anyone who sees this magazine – that choking is a sign of 
passion rather than of violence.'

Terry Richardson, who in 2010 was accused of sexually harassing a model he photographed, shot Ms Seymour and Mr Teixeira for the Vogue cover.

The inside fashion spread also features Mr Teixeira touching Ms Seymour’s breast and Seymour 
grabbing the fellow model's pants.

'Choking is not a fashion statement, and certainly not something that 
should be used to sell magazines'

The letter added: 'A 2008 Journal of 
Emergency Medicine study of murders of women in 11 cities found that 43per cent
of women who were killed by intimate partners had experienced at least 
one previous episode of choking before being killed.

'That is why, in 
2010, New York State made choking a violent felony, and advocates, 
prosecutors, police officers and survivors throughout the State have 
embraced the law as a way to save women’s lives.

'In New York, your magazine appears on numerous newsstands and has enormous reach with young men and women.

'While this cover was perhaps intended to shock and thrill potential readers, the truly shocking fact is that it glorifies violence against women as an act of love'.

The organizations have also asked Conde Nast to pledge not to use 
violent images like this in the future.
