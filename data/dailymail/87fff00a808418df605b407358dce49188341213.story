She's well accustomed to pulling drawstrings to reveal commemorative plaques but Queen Elizabeth today had her work cut out when she had to unveil a huge statue.

The giant artwork, created by sculptor 
Robert Rattray, depicted two lifesize Windsor Grey 
horses - animals which have been drawing the carriages of successive 
monarchs since Queen Victoria.

The statue has been made to stand in Windsor to celebrate the Queen's long reign after residents raised £200,000 for its creation.

First look: The crowd eagerly awaits as the Queen arrives to pull the covering off the statue

Pull! Unveiling this work requires some extra effort

Ta-da! The statue is of horses used to draw the monarch's carriage during events ranging from Trooping the Colour to Royal Ascot

Closer inspection: The Queen was said to be interested in the 'technicalities of the work' made from bronze

Reigning in springtime: The Queen matched the white blossom as she cut a path by the daffodils

Gift: The monarch was handed a pretty bunch of flowers as she met people at the event

Royal support: The Queen was joined by Prince Philip and Prince William

Radiant: The Queen was all smiles as she arrived

The Queen, dressed in almost 
top to toe in white, pulled a rope to remove a 
large purple cloth that had been draped over the artwork and 400 people 
watching from behind barriers gave a cheer.

The
 monarch's choice of outfit meant she matched the white blossom in bloom along the
 The Long Walk, Windsor, and stood out amongst the vibrant daffodils.

She wore a long coat over a dress in the same pale 
shade and matching hat. She added some contrast to the outfit with black
 gloves, handbag and shoes that matched the dark buttons on her coat.

Prince Philip and Prince William, who looked to be sharing a joke during part of the proceedings, were also in attendance. It was one of a few times when the Duke of Cambridge has joined his grandmother and grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, at a public event.

The princes appeared to share a joke during proceedings... or where they playing charades?

The statue was created in bronze by sculptor Robert Rattray and is based on Daniel and Storm, two horses stabled at the Royal Mews.

They are regularly used to draw the monarch's carriage during events ranging from Trooping the Colour to Royal Ascot.

After the artist Mr Rattray had chatted to the Queen he said: 'I think she was pleased with it - I hope she was. We were talking about how it was made - it was made in sections - she was interested in the technicalities of the work.'

The royal couple waved as they were driven to the venue

Proud: The large statue dwarfs spectators. Locals raised £200,000 for its creation

The sculpture is a tribute from the people of Windsor who wanted to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation, celebrated last year, and commemorate the contribution Windsor Greys have made to the ceremonial life of the nation.

After an appeal was started to raise money for the project William agreed to become its patron.

The Duke of Cambridge today joked about his role in a project declaring he had his arm "twisted".

William made the light-hearted quip after Rosemary Ussher, who led the appeal to raise funds for the project, told supporters and trustees that the Duke's support was "a great morale booster".

Prince William looked dapper in a blue suit and lighter blue tie as he attended to support his grandmother without wife Kate and son Prince George.

Yesterday, a picture was released on the Duchess of Cambridge's first Mother's Day showing the new parents with their eight-month-old and pet dog Lupo at their home in Kensington Palace.

The family will be representing the monarch next week when they tour Australia with baby George (and his Nanny) in tow.
