Plans to give 2013 Champion Chase winner Sprinter Sacre his first appearance in public for over a year remained in place  despite Newbury having to pass an inspection.

Officials will check the Berkshire track at 7.30 with overnight temperatures set to plummet. There is also a threat of freezing fog.

Sprinter Sacre has not run since suffering from a fibrillating heart when pulled up in the Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton on December 27 last year.

He is due to enter the Newbury parade ring at 11.30 before heading to the track under c15 minutes later.

Trainer Nicky Henderson said: ‘We might jump half a dozen fences down the back straight and then let him stride up the home straight.

‘It won’t be some great gallop. It is just giving him a school and letting him enjoy himself.’

Trainer Nicky Henderson said it would be a case of giving the former Champions Chase winner a run out

The first serious cold snap to hit British racing this winter claimed Sunday’s meeting at Leicester and Monday afternoon’s Doncaster fixture.

Monday's other jumps meeting at Kelso must survive a 6.45am inspection.

Trainer Tom George says both God’s Own and Module will now step up in trip after being beaten over two miles at Kempton on Saturday.
