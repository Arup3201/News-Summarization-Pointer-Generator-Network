Bringing one of the world's biggest lambs into existence was no mean feat - in fact, one could say it was a David versus Goliath battle. 

Farmer David Enticott, 53, helped deliver the newborn on Thursday, naming him Goliath after discovering he tipped the scales at 22.5lbs.

The hefty animal is three times the size of an average lamb and weighs the same as a human toddler.

He weighs just 1.5lb less than the Guinness World record holder, who was born at 24lbs in Lancashire in May 2013. 

Mr
 Enticott's wife, Ann, 49, said she had never seen anything quite like 
the lamb, who was born at the couple’s farm in Wellington, Somerset.

'He is amazing. He was born three days ago now, thankfully the mum didn’t suffer during the birth,' said Mrs Enticott, who has been lambing with her husband for 13 years,

'My
 husband was helping her and he noticed that the lamb had extremely big 
feet - you can normally tell from the feet how big the lamb will be.

Astonishing: He weighs 22.5lbs - just 1.5lb less than the Guinness World record holder, who was born at 24lbs

Newborn: The enormous lamb was born at farmer David Enticott's farm in Wellington, Somerset, on Thursday

'When he was born we just couldn’t believe how big he was. We decided that we should weight him so we did and he was 22.5Ibs.

'When we looked online we realised just how impressive this was. He’s out in the shed now but he’s very gangly because of his size. 

He’s so big he just lolops around. We’ve been lambing since January so far this season and he is as big now as some of the lambs born in January.'

His first steps: Giant lambs can cause pelvic injuries to mothers, but Goliath's mother emerged unscathed

She added: 'We’ve been lambing now since 2001 and never in our time have we seen a lamb as big as this.

Ewes often give birth to twins, triplets or sometimes more than three each delivery, but when they have a single offspring it can often be larger.

These lambs can cause pelvic injuries to the mother, but thankfully Goliath’s mother emerged unscathed.

Shocked: Mr Enticott's wife, Ann, pictured with Goliath and his mother, was shocked by the newborn's size
