The rise of do-it-yourself porn is devastating the mainstream industry as increasing numbers of 'amateurs' use the internet to upload homemade sex videos.

Traditional porn stars are being replaced by everyday people who upload porn to sites like Reddit or build up a fan following through live web cam sites such as Chaturbate.

The growth is concerning the mainstream porn industry, which has seen a huge decline in profits.

In the past porn stars such as Linda Lovelace were as famous as actors and musicians but there are few household names now.

Instead, DIY porn is increasingly popular and people can upload pictures or video of themselves on a whim - and with a good chance of anonymity if they want it.

Performances are also almost totally unregulated, especially if the performance if live.

In 1998, a study by Forrester Research
 on the porn industry - including paraphernalia, internet, cable 
television and magazines - estimated it was worth up to $10billion.

This year, the worldwide industry is 
estimated to be worth up to $5billion - however, it is difficult to know
 how accurate these figures are.

The mainstream industry has been hit not only through piracy and free content, but people choosing to pay to watch live sex acts over the internet.

Increasing numbers of 'regular' 
people are treating web cam porn - or 'camming' - as their main job and 
believe it brings less stigma than being unemployed.

'Joshua' told Kernel Mag that his job allows him to earn money while he stays at home caring for his six-year-old daughter while his wife works.

He admits he does worry that being paid to perform sex acts and strip over a web camera will impact on his wife and daughter.

But he added: 'But there’s such a stigma around the long-term unemployed now that I’m not sure it could be much worse.'

Sites like Chaturbate emulate traditional strip clubs where viewers 'tip' the performers.

As in strip clubs, people can pay for private performances. It is also possible to interact with the performers through the web cam.

Users of Reddit say they not only post pictures for money or notoriety but to give themselves a confidence boost

Webcams have allowed people to become porn stars in their own home

'Joshua' said he can receive tips of up to $100 a time.

But the real change in pornography is the number of people who are doing it for no payment at all.

So-called tube sites - that imitate YouTube and allow anyone to upload content - have doubled in a year to 1,000.

She told Kernal Mag the positive reaction was 'totally overwhelming' and that she would post further pictures if she needed a confidence boost.

Users can rate the content and the more positive the reaction, the more prominent it is displayed on the site.

She said: 'I’d like to do it again. People on reddit said I have to show more flesh to make my posts successful, though. I’ll probably do it when I need a pick-me-up.'

Mainstream porn companies are worried about the rise of amateur porn.

USA Today reported that DVD orders from distributers have shrunk this year to about 1,500 from 5,00 to 6,000 in 2005.

Steven Hirsch, who founded porn company Vivid Entertainment, told the newspaper: 'We're dealing with a perfect storm: decliing DVD sales, rampant piracy, free content and a weak economy.'

Piracy, as in the film and music industries, is causing huge problems for mainstream porn companies.

Kathee Brewer, an editor at AVN, which covers the porn industry, told USA Today:'The tubes are making money off the studio's investment of time and money, while the studios are forced to spend ever larger chunks tof change to police the tubes and send endless takedown notices.'
