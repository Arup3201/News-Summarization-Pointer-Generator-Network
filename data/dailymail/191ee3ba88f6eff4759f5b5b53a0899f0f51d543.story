Cannabis is said to heighten your sense of smell and taste, and now it could boost sexual pleasure too.

A Californian company has created ‘sensual enhancement oil’ for women, which is made from a mixture of coconut and cannabis oils.

And it claims the oil can result in a ‘high’ for some users.

Foria can be ingested or applied topically, to ‘create the relaxation needed for sensual experience’ and possibly multiple orgasms.

While it can result in some users getting high, Aphrodite Group – the medical marijuana collective that sells the potion – said the majority of women who use it do not experience that feeling, but instead are more relaxed.

‘The psychoactive effects of getting "high" when taken orally are consistent with other edible medical marijuana products,’ it explained.

The formula was inspired by the historical use of cannabis as an aphrodisiac in traditional cultures around the world.

‘For some women, it may awaken arousal and heighten sensation making orgasms more intense, fuller, or easier to access,’ Foria’s makers claim.

‘For others, it can help promote natural lubrication, reduce pain and tension and create the relaxation necessary for sensual experience, or restorative rest.’

The mixture is not designed to be used like a standard lubricant, but is designed to be applied at least half an hour before sex.

This time allows for the active compounds of the drug to be fully activated and absorbed, the collective said.

While men can also use it, the lubricant 
is intended for women because the membrane of the vagina is more 
sensitive and absorbent. 

'Introducing medicines, compounds and different drugs through the vagina is something that both modern doctors and doctors throughout history have done,' Matthew Gerson, creator of Foria told Nerve.

'Women report a sense of embodiment, a sense of dropping into a more full relationship to sexual sensations and sensations around the body.

'As you can imagine, as that builds up to orgasm - if orgasm is a part of your experience - then that can lead to intensification and a more full body experience,' he continued.

Some women who have used the product reported tingling as well as increased warmth and relaxation. Others had multiple orgasms, but some found the lubricant helped them fall asleep.

The potion costs $88 for 1oz (30ml) or $24 for 5ml, but it is currently only available to residents of California who have a letter from their doctor, or a medical marijuana card.

It is not clear whether the potion will be made available outside of the state, and MailOnline has contacted the company for more information.
