We are more accustomed to seeing her in a barely-there bikini for her Victoria's Secret campaigns, but Candice Swanepoel works a more sophisticated style in her latest shoot.

The 25-year-old supermodel has been unveiled as the new face of Max Factor Excess Volume Mascara and looks picture-perfect in the boudoir inspired campaign.

The blonde lingerie model wears a revealing feather embellished black dress, which is slashed at the thigh and chest to reveal her toned figure.
