Madcap: Kevin Beresford's bizarre calendar featuring some of Britain's most notorious insane asylums has already shifted 4,000 copies

It may seem mad, but a calendar of images featuring some of Britain's most notorious insane asylums has sparked the latest Christmas craze.

Eccentric entrepreneur Kevin Beresford, 60, who has made headlines with past calendars featuring pictures of Croydon roundabouts, prisons and roadkill, has been inundated with orders for the crazy calendar since its release.

Hundreds of copies have already been snapped up, with each month showing the imposing Victorian buildings which became home to schizophrenics, epileptics and the feeble-minded.

Kevin said: 'I drove around the country to find the insane asylums which were the most notorious.

'It is a controversial subject so I only featured institutions which are no longer in use any more. The
calendars seem to appeal to a wide range of people, especially nurses 
and people in the medical profession that like the black humour.'

So far, 4,000 of the £9.99 calendars have been sold and those who have bought it will kick off 2013 with an image of the Second County Lunatic Asylum in Gloucester which opened in 1884.

February features the picturesque Dorset County Lunatic Asylum which had its own farm, cinema and theatre.

Now a Worcestershire pub, March's picture shows the former Droitwich Spa Lunatic Asylum, which was opened in the 18th century, while the April shot is of Barnsley Hall Hospital, also in Worcestershire, which was once home to Springwatch star Bill Oddie's mother.

An image of Berrywood asylum in Northamptonshire will capture the imagination in May with June featuring the Garlands Lunatic Asylum in Carlisle where the most common illness was schizophrenia, with others declared insane as a result of lost loves and unfortunate marriages.

St Lawrence’s Asylum in Caterham, Surrey, is the image for July and was charged with providing healthcare for 'insane' paupers living in workhouses.

August offers the County Mental Asylum at Cheddleton, built in the 1890’s by Staffordshire County Lunacy Committee to relieve over-crowing in other institutions, while September shows a terrifying collection of images from the creepy High Royds in Menston, West Yorkshire.

The asylum was eventually exposed for patient abuse and doctors used to hold patients underwater, throw objects at them and use electric shock therapy.

Dorset's Herrison Hospital features in October and November's offering is Powick Hospital in Worcestershire - where Dr Ronald Sandison began pioneering work in the psychiatric use of LSD.

Ten years ago, the NHS paid out £195,000 in an out of court settlement to 43 former patients who were treated with LSD between 1952 and 1970.

The year ends with Monyhull Colony in Birmingham, which was for epileptics and the feeble-minded and once home to 1,400 with learning disabilities

Many former asylums have been converted into homes, such as the former Napsbury Hospital in London Colney, Hertfordshire

Victorian asylums were hailed as places of refuge for some of society’s supposedly most vulnerable men and women.

These buildings were called ‘lunatic asylums’, and later renamed ‘mental hospitals’. They earned a reputation as dehumanising, prison-like institutions.

Before asylums,the burden of keeping vulnerable individuals rested almost entirely on loved ones. ‘Mad’ people who could not be kept at home wandered free, begging for food and shelter.

A growing market economy in the 1600s and 1700s saw ‘service professions’ emerge.

Those who worked in them did thankless jobs formerly handled at home or by the church, and included undertakers, private tutors and ‘madhouse-keepers’.

Families paid for secrecy and discretion, and private ‘madhouses’ left few records. Artefacts show keepers used physical restraints such as leg-irons and manacles.

Public funding poured into asylum construction between 1800 and 1900.

The patient population in England went from about 10,000 to 10 times that. Asylums built in this period impressed public officials, as the buildings were designed to be majestic and therapeutic.

Extraordinary attention was paid to ventilation and to safety, and most asylums also featured extensive grounds.

Expensive but inflexible buildings became overcrowded, and by 1890 the majority of patients left only in coffins.

Techniques such as straitjackets, seclusion and sedative drugs such as bromides were used on unruly patients.

In the first half of the 1900s asylums (or ‘mental hospitals’) became testing grounds for controversial treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and lobotomy.

These methods helped some patients function again, but they irreparably harmed others.

Many mental hospitals closed in the 1970s and 1980s. This was due to pressure from the anti-psychiatry movement, feminist criticism, ex-patient activism and political suspicion of large, unaccountable institutions.
