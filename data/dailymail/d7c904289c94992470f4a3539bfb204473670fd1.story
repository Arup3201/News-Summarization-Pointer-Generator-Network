One in three over-50s say they have been discriminated against because of their age.

They claim they receive worse service in shops and hospitals, and are treated discourteously, patronised and even harassed simply for being older.

The figure for the over-65s is even higher, at 37 per cent.

One in three over 50s say they receive worse services in shops and hospitals because of their age

The study, by University College London, found that well-qualified, retired men in their seventies were most likely to feel victimised.

Researchers pooled data on 7,800 men and women aged 52 and above from across the country and in different walks of life.

They were asked whether they had to put up with one or more of five types of age discrimination in their daily lives, including harassment, being talked down to, being disrespected, discrimination in medical services and discrimination in restaurants and shops.

A little over 2,600 – a third – said they had encountered prejudice  of some sort, with the proportion rising to 37 per cent among over-65s. For those still working, the figure was 28 per cent.

A lack of respect or courtesy was experienced by 18 per cent, while 11 per cent said they felt talked down to because people assumed they were not clever.

Around one in ten believed they receive worse treatment in doctors’ surgeries, hospitals, restaurants and shops, and 5 per cent think they suffer harassment purely because of their age.

The report – published in the journal 
Age And Ageing – states: ‘These findings highlight the scale of the 
challenge of age discrimination for older adults. The population 
continues to age due to a decrease in fertility coupled with an 
increased life expectancy. With people living longer, age discrimination
 is likely to gain greater prominence.

‘A
 key aspect that separates age discrimination from other forms of unfair
 treatment is that everyone is potentially at risk of experiencing it at
 some point in their lives.’

Paul
 Green, of the Saga lifestyle group for the over-50s, said: 
‘Discrimination is a nasty trait – but against older people it is also 
pretty self-defeating. Older people have 80 per cent of the nation’s 
wealth, they are savvy consumers who know how they should be treated and
 their life experience makes them wise and good company.  

‘Some in the private and public sector need to lift their game when dealing with an ageing society.’

Caroline
 Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘Sadly, age discrimination is all too 
prevalent today. Whilst there is legislation making it illegal, this 
needs to be accompanied by a seismic shift in societal attitudes towards
 older people and ageing.’
