More than half of university-aged students have admitted to watching porn to help them find out more about sex.

Some 60 per cent of 2,500 people questioned said they learned more about intercourse by watching scenes online.

A further 40 per cent questioned said watching porn online helped their understanding of sex - despite three quarters saying that porn provides unrealistic expectations, the research carried out by the National Union of Students revealed.

Only a third of students said they felt that they could practically apply the knowledge taught in their sex and relationships lessons to real life.

The same amount also admitted that they did not feel their SRE lessons helped their confidence, calling into question whether there needs to be changes made to the curriculum. 

The research found a 'real life' education is absent in the classroom as SRE is treated like a science lesson with puberty, contraception, sexual health, bodies and anatomy listed as the top subjects covered.

Consent was never touched upon for two thirds, with relationships covered for less than half, and a fifth of students say they have not discussed lesbian, gay or transgender relationships in class.

More than a third felt their SRE did not rate positively on equality and diversity.

Psychologist Dr Arthur Cassidy said there are worrying issues with students using porn as their main source of sex education.

He added: 'Exposure to all aspects of pornography can become addictive, destroy sexually healthy relationships and encourage sexual aggression in both genders.

'Porn is practically ubiquitous and easy fix. The accessibility. anonymity and affordability of online sex and hard core pornography has profound potential to create long-term chronically deficient sexual relationships, even among students.'

Despite many students saying that they found porn to be a good source of sex education they also agreed it leaves them with unrealistic expectations

He continued: 'It is imperative that SRE is fully acceptable by all leading political parties, but more so, that we do not make hasty reactions to one major study. 

'This sensitive issue requires fresh thinking and knows what are the most appropriate questions to ask and replace the full stops by question marks. 

'Compulsive porn can destroy emotional intelligence and other aspects of self identity at a time in student life when 19-year-old men especially are trying to negotiate their identity through life.'

NUS Vice President Colum McGuire said: 'We now urge all political parties to commit to statutory SRE in their general election manifestos, and accept that simple biology just won't cut it. 

'Sex is not a science lesson. People are being left with gaps in their education. Inadequate SRE puts young people at risk. I find it alarming that sexual partners are listed as a top SRE source by our respondents. 

'Consider this in light of the fact that consent was never even raised for two thirds of respondents. SRE is failing millions. NUS runs consent workshops on campuses across the country, covering a vital aspect of SRE that this government misses. 

'The current system almost completely ignores LGBT relationships. In a country where we passed an equal marriage bill, this is the height of hypocrisy.

'Students are having to look outside the education system to find any information that will help them learn more about SRE in real life.'
