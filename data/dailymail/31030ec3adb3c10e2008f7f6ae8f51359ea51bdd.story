One of two rusting cars hauled out of an Oklahoma lake this week is believed to contain the remains of three teenagers who have been missing since 1970, police say.

The blue Chevrolet Camaro matched the description of the car 18-year-olds Thomas Michael Rios and Leah Gail Johnson, and 16-year-old Jimmy Allen Williams were last seen in.

An Oklahoma sheriff has now said investigators are confident that three sets of remains found in the car belong to the friends, who were last seen heading to a football match.

In total, six sets of remains have been found in the two car wrecks, which were discovered as police tested sonar on the lake last week, according to Fox News.

'We believe that we have two vehicles related to two different missing persons cases,' Custer County Sheriff Bruce Peoples said.

'One is a case from Beckham County in 1970, and the other is a case from Washita County in 1969.'

Even though the cars are linked to cases years apart, they were found submerged side by side, 12ft under the surface.

Bottles of beer were also found in the car believed to belong to the teenagers, according to the Daily Elk Citian.

'None of the human remains in the Camaro show signs of trauma on first inspection, but keep in mind that they're covered in mud and will need to be examined further,' Sheriff Peoples said.

Although officers are confident they have found the teenagers, it could take up to a year before DNA results confirm the identities.

Police are also just beginning to investigate the remains found in the second car. 'They're getting into the trunk. We don't have any information yet on how many sets of remains may be in there,' Sheriff Peoples said.

Baffled: The discovery of two rusting vintage cars containing six bodies has reignited the mystery of how three teenagers and three other people vanished more than four decades ago

Evidence: An investigator takes a picture of a shoe at the crime scene where six bodies and two cars were pulled from the lake

Shock discovery: It happened in Custer County, Oklahoma, when officers went to Foss Lake to take out a new sonar detection system, just to see how well it worked

Three bodies believed to be those of local teenagers who disappeared in 1970 were discovered inside the Camaro

The other car - a 1950 model Chevrolet - contained three bodies believed to be those of Washita County residents who went missing in the early 1960s

He added: 'This lake isn’t crystal clear. It’s a
typical western Oklahoma lake with a lot of silt in it. The visibility 
is only 6 to 12 inches on a good day,' he said.

The mystery surrounding the teenagers' disappearance led to theories that they had stumbled across a crime and been murdered.

It is too early to tell what happened to the victims found in the two cars, but Sheriff Peoples said: 'We'll treat it as a crime until we're able to determine it's a simple car wreck.'

he added that it was possible the people simply drove into the lake and drowned.

Retired Sheriff Howard Sampier had been working the night the teenagers went missing.

He said: 'Never really had any good leads to speak of. We never had any sort of lead or idea about the Foss Lake area.'

The
friends had told their families they were heading to a football game so
the search for them centered on possible routes they could have taken.

A
lake on the route they were supposed to have taken had even been 
searched previously, but it turns out the police could have been looking
in the wrong place entirely.

Although
the cars were found close to a boat ramp, Sheriff Peoples said the 
water is so cloudy it was understandable that they had remained 
undetected.

Investigation: It could take up to a year to fully identify the remains of those found in the two cars

Closure: The sheriffs office hopes the discovery of the cars will help provide answers to the victims' families

The
second car is thought to contain the remains of a 69-year-old man and 
his two friends who went missing in the state in the late 1950s or early
1960s.

Reports yesterday by local station KFOR states that one of the victims in the car thought to have belonged to the teenager has been identified but they are waiting to notify all of the relatives of the victims involved before releasing any names.

The teenagers went missing on November 20, 1970. They
are still listed as missing persons and were thought to have been 
headed to a football game in nearby Elk City but also could have 
detoured to go hunting at Foss Lake.

Authorities 
discovered the cars accidentally. Betsy Randolph, spokesman for the 
Oklahoma Highway Patrol, said dive teams were at Foss Lake conducting 
training with sonar when they came upon the vehicles last week.

'So
they went back and did a scheduled dive today and were going to recover
the cars. When they pulled the cars out of the water, the first one 
that came out they found bones in the car,' she said.

Investigation: Custer County Sheriff Bruce Peoples said the decomposed nature of the cars made it difficult to positively identify them at the scene

When
they pulled the second car out, another set of bones was discovered. 
The divers then went back in the water and searched around and found a 
skull, she said.

Jimmy Allen Williams, 16, and his friends Thomas Michael Rios, 18, and Leah Gail Johnson, 18, disappeared on On Nov. 20, 1970.

Jimmy, who had a part time job at a grocery store, had bought himself a brand new Camaro muscle car six days earlier.

He told his parents he was going to a football game, but according to reports at the time, he backed up his car to the back door of the home and loaded several shotguns into the trunk with the help of one of his younger brothers.

According to one of his friends called Wayne, the three friends were actually going on a shooting trip.

Wayne said he was had planned to join them but changed his mind at the last minute because there was not enough room for him in the car.

The three teenagers never returned home.

The 
remains were turned over to the medical examiner's office who are 
expected to use DNA from surviving family members to identify the 
skeletons.

'We thought it was just going to be stolen vehicles and that's not what it turned out to be, obviously,' Ms Randolph said.

Kim Carmichael was a friend of the Camaro's owner, 16-year-old Jimmy Williams.

She told Oklahoma's Newsnine.com: 'I just remember how devastated everybody was

'We lived in a little town ... Nothing like that ever happened in Sayre.

At
the time of the disappearance, Ms Carmichael's father was the 
undersheriff in nearby Beckham County where the teenagers were last seen. 

He died in 2003 never knowing what happened.

Ms
Carmichael added: 'He said there was nothing ... There were no leads, 
no nothing. He said it was just like they vanished into thin air.

.'I can't imagine what [Williams'] family was going through if I could see what my dad was going through.'

Oklahoma Highway Patrol said they are hoping the
discovery will offer some relief to families who may have gone decades 
wondering where a missing loved one was.

Ms Randolph added: 'We're hoping these individuals, that 
this is going to bring some sort of closure to some families out there 
who have been waiting to hear about missing people.

Drudging up clues: There were five skeletons between the two cars

Scene: The cars weer found in Foss Lake near Elk City in western Oklahoma

'If 
that's the case, then we're thrilled we were able to bring some sort of 
closure to those families.'

The
medical examiner had called a number of relatives of possible victims 
to the scene, many of whom said that they never lost hope.

'We
never gave up. We always wanted some clue that somebody knew someone,' 
said Debbie McManaman, a possible victim's granddaughter.
