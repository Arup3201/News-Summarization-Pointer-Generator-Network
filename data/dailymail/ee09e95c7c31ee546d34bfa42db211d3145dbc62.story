A day after the Premier League’s £5.136billion TV deal raised the stakes, Aston Villa decided they could not afford the possibility of relegation.

Villa finally sacked beleaguered manager Paul Lambert on Wednesday night after slipping into the drop zone following their dismal 2-0 defeat at Hull City on Tuesday night.

When there is even more money for the clubs at English football’s top table, decisions like that become a whole lot easier.

Goals - 12 - ranked 20th in the PL

Chances created - 188 - 19th

Shots - 186 - 19th

Conversion rate - 6 per cent - 20th

Shots on target - 67 - 20th

Shooting accuracy - 36 per cent - 20th 

The 45-year-old’s final game in charge was Villa’s 10th Premier League match without a win and came after more supporter protests. Fans have wanted him out for weeks, frustrated by a lack of points, goals and style.

The trip to Hull was their 15th league match of the season without scoring. Christian Benteke, Ron Vlaar and Tom Cleverley — considered three of the better players — were left on the bench. Villa supporters unveiled a ‘Lambert Out’ banner.

His departure came on the day the Birmingham Mail called for Villa to immediately axe the Scot with a piece entitled: ‘Birmingham Mail says: Lambert must go!’

But it comes a fortnight after Villa chief executive Tom Fox insisted they would not bow to fan pressure. Tim Sherwood and Jurgen Klinsmann are two of the early contenders to take over.

A statement on the club’s website read: ‘Aston Villa has parted company with manager Paul Lambert. First-team coach Scott Marshall and goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall will continue to prepare the squad for Sunday’s FA Cup tie with Leicester City at Villa Park.’

The players are believed to have been left out of the loop over the sacking and found out via television and social media. Most of them have relegation clauses in their contracts for wage cuts of between 30 and 50 per cent in the event of relegation, so the club are sure to expect an immediate reaction to the change at the helm.

In the short-term, goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall, who has been increasingly vocal in training of late, is likely to play a big role in trying to rally the squad. Lambert’s Premier League record with Villa is woeful. Their 12 goals scored, six per cent shot conversion rate, 67 shots on target and 36 per cent shooting accuracy ranks them worst in the top flight.

That led to the Birmingham Mail campaign, which urged: ‘Aston Villa is a proud and noble name in English football. It is an historic club at the heart of our community, a founding father of the beautiful game. But this great club is now on its knees and the Holte End is hurting — and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen.

‘Today the Birmingham Mail makes one simple, stark request to the board: sack the manager.’

Former Villa striker Andy Gray also called for change on talksport, saying: ‘I really worry for my old club. I am not one for seeing people lose their jobs, but sometimes change is necessary. It is all right to say ‘‘our business plan is that we don’t sack people mid-season’’, but if that’s the case you might be playing in a different league next year.’

Chief executive Fox had previously insisted it would be wrong for him and owner Randy Lerner to sack Lambert, which would be a gamble no different to ‘flipping a coin’. A place in the bottom three brought a swift change of heart.

Peter Withe, who scored Villa’s European Cup winner in 1982, said on Wednesday night: ‘The most important thing is to get someone in who is right until the end of season; someone with a feeling for the club, who can bring the fans back and inspire them.’

Today the Birmingham Mail makes one simple, stark request to the Aston Villa board: sack the manager.

Paul Lambert is not the man to save this club from relegation and the long-term damage that disaster will bring.

We do not say this lightly, nor do we take any pleasure in saying that Lambert should go.

The Birmingham Mail has been as patient as many of the claret and blue fans, standing by and hoping things will improve.

Despite the results, despite the performances.

But time is now up.

No progress has been made under Lambert. In fact, this once mighty club is now staring relegation in the face.

A relegation that would cost the club a lucrative share of the new £2 billion Sky and BT television deal.

Dropping down a division would be a disaster financially, and one from which Villa may never recover.

As custodian of the club, Randy Lerner must ensure it doesn’t happen.

Lambert has presided over just two Premier League victories in 20 matches since agreeing a bumper new four-year deal in mid-September.

The poor, and too often dull, performances mean the team is last on Match Of The Day nearly every week - and at this rate destined for an even later Saturday night slot on the Football League show next season.

That’s why Villa must act now - before it’s too late.

Awful football, declining attendances, and post-match excuses that beggar belief.

Aston Villa should not be aiming to survive - they should be aiming to strive, to compete in the higher reaches of the league.

Long-ball football has been replaced by an equally unsuccessful possession-based style of play.

Now the manager says his side must play ugly football to get themselves clear of relegation - and they will, he says.

We don’t believe Lambert anymore. He is out of ideas, there is nothing left for him to say to his players that he hasn’t said already.

We respect his integrity and loyalty, but the fans don’t want him.

The fans deserve better.

Enough is enough.
