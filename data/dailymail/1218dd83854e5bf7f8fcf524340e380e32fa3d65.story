New Yorkers crowded the city's already busy streets Friday evening to catch of glimpse of the year's second - and final - Manhattanhenge.

The term, coined by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, describes a phenomenon that occurs when 'when the setting sun aligns precisely with the 
Manhattan street grid, creating a radiant glow of light across 
Manhattan's brick and steel canyons, simultaneously illuminating both 
the north and south sides of every cross street of the borough's grid,

Looking down the street this evening, people could see a full sun hovering just above the horizon.

On Saturday, the event will show a half-sun at the horizon.

The year's previous Manhattanhenge happened in May, but was obscured by cloudy skies.

But as USA Today notes, this time there was be a breathtaking view.

'Both nights should be good viewing 
wise,' AccuWeather Meteorologist Alyson Hoegg said. 'Both nights will be
 clear to partly cloudy.'

Well worn streets such as 23rd and 42nd draw a high number of Manhattanhenge viewers.

A similar phenomenon also occurs twice in the winter, but in the morning with the sun rising through the grid.
