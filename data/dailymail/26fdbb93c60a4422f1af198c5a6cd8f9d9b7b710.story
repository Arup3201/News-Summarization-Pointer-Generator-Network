So now I'm over in New York City, the Big Apple, and as Sting would say: 'I'm a legal alien, I'm an Englishman in New York.'

Certainly an English gentleman is viewed as a bit of breed apart over here - but it's very much in a good way. Being well spoken and using received pronunciation still gets you a long way in NYC.

'Oh I love your accent,' numerous attractive females have remarked since I've arrived.

I thought all that stuff was just in films but clearly New York women really do respond to cut-glass vowels and think that means you are well-educated and cultured, a gentleman who can be trusted and well-heeled and a good catch.

Far be it for me to say if any of those apply to me but even if they don't I'm certainly not going to shatter any illusions. I'm even happy to play up to the Hugh Grant style foppish character if that's what's expected of me.

It's really not rocket science, any British guy with half a brain could come over here and clean up by pretending to be posh – and that got me thinking about what it actually means to be posh?

I recently filmed for the Michael McIntyre chat show and he said I was definitely posh. I thought that was a bit 'kettle and pot' because he sounds just as plummy voiced as I do. He grew up in Hampstead, went to a private school in St Johns Wood and then Edinburgh University - so not exactly the school of hard knocks and the university of life.

But then again, I went to Eton and have quite a few friends called Rupert.

But I don't think posh means much in these days of social mobility – certainly you don't need to born into it anymore, my father was born and bred in Sheffield, was originally a mechanic by trade and then worked extremely hard to make his fortune.

Clearly he gave me amazing opportunities and a great education but that just goes to show that nowadays being posh is a state of mind, not something you are born into.

And so I've devised a quick quiz to see if you pass the posh test...

Do you describe your evening meal as:

A: Dinner

B: Tea

C: Supper

Is your room for entertaining at home called:

A: The lounge

B: The telly room

C: The drawing room

From the age of 10, have you called your mother: 

A: Mum

B: Ma

C: Mummy

Do you drive:

A: An SUV

B: A family saloon

C: A Landrover

When trying to communicate an affirmative answer would you say:

A: Yes

B: Yeah

C: Yah

Would you buy your jewellery from:

A: A catalogue

B: The high street

C: A bespoke fine jeweller like Vashi.com

Do you buy your after-shave

A: The supermarket

B: From the high street

C: From high-end retailer like Escentual.com

Clearly if you've answered C to all of the above then you are posh. There's nothing to be ashamed of, just come over to New York City you may find that you're quite popular with the ladies here.

Lot of love, Spencer.
