Rebecca Hough, pictured with her son, Max, was told by the swimming pool manager to stop breastfeeding her son

Swimming pool staff told a mother to stop breastfeeding in case her baby vomited into the water.

Rebecca Hough was swimming with 10-month-old Max in Liskeard, Cornwall, when he became hungry - so she got out of the pool, moved a few steps away and began feeding him.

But the 23-year-old said she was told to retreat further to the changing rooms and not come back for half an hour in case Max was sick.

Ms Hough, from Torpoint, Cornwall, 
complained the intervention by a manager at the Lux Park Leisure Centre 
left her feeling angry and embarrassed.

'He's
 a breast fed baby and always has been,' she said. 'I got in the pool 
and he was a bit unsettled, so I decided to give him a really quick 
feed, as more of a comfort thing than anything else, rather than a full 
feed.

'I went to the side of
 the pool and up some steps away from the pool. I noticed the lifeguard 
go onto his walky talkie, and then a manager came out to speak to me.

'They told me I would have to leave and not come back until the milk had digested.

'The pool wasn't busy and I wasn't showing off my boobs, but they asked me to sit in the changing rooms.

'I just said it was fine, but I was a bit embarrassed and when I left and got home I started to get a bit angry.'

The Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to discriminate against a woman for breastfeeding in a public place.

The manager involved has since written to apologise to Ms Hough, who lives with her partner Chris Conn, 32, a diving instructor.

But Tempus Leisure, which runs the pool, insisted staff were simply trying to maintain water quality.

The half an hour period was imposed to make sure Max had digested all his milk.

Marketing manager Marc 
Laundon said: 'This is very much an issue of maintaining water quality 
as we work hard to keep the water in all our pools safe and clean.

'The member of staff was concerned that a baby that has just been fed could very easily be sick in the pool.

Ms Hough was also banned from returning to the water for half an hour in case Max was sick

'This
 would obviously not be pleasant for other users and could potentially 
lead to a pool closure which would inconvenience many other customers.

'At
 the moment we don't have a specific policy on breastfeeding on poolside
 as we assume most customers realise the implications and it has not 
previously been an issue.

'The
 centre manager in this instance has written to the customer apologising
 for any upset and made a judgement in advance of a company-wide policy 
being introduced that it is currently acceptable at that centre.

'We
 seek to make our facilities open and welcoming to everyone of all ages 
but the priority is always the health and safety of everyone.'

Ms
 Hough added: 'I'm a confident feeder but some girls aren't and 
something like that could really shake their confidence. I was polite 
but I should have argued against it.

'It's
 a lovely pool - really warm and clean and I have been there loads of 
times - but I felt really embarrassed by being asked to leave when I 
wasn't doing anything wrong.'
