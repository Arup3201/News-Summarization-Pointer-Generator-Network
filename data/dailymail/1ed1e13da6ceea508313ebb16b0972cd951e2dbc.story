It is the fragrance that's supposed to capture the very spirit of David Beckham - one of Britain's most celebrated style leaders.

The Essence aftershave for men was launched by the former England footballer as a scent which conveys his 'sense of adventure'.

But this Christmas the 39-year-old's product is being sold at budget chain Poundland for just over a third of the usual price – and apparently without his knowledge.

The fragrance, which is emblazoned with Beckham's name, normally retails at £24.99 but can be bought for just £8 at the discount store until January.

The Essence 75ml eau de toilette is part of the father-of-four's range by Coty. Shoppers at the chain have been snapping up the chance to buy the discounted aftershave in a promotion which requires them to spend £3 in one of the Poundland stores first.

It would be hard to imagine that his wife Victoria, 40 – who rose to fame as 'Posh Spice' – would welcome the invited association of the Beckham brand with the bold budget store.

Beckham – who together with fashion designer Victoria is worth over £210million – is better known for being linked to higher end names such as Sainsbury, Jaguar and luxury Swiss brand Breitling for Bentley.

He has famously posed in his underwear for fashion house Giorgio Armani - and earlier this year promoted H&M's Bodywear range.

The former midfielder is known to be heavily involved in all the fragrances that carry his name which also include the popular Homme and Instinct scents.

The Essence which was launched by the star in 2012 has elements of grapefruit, lavender, cardmom and patchouli. It promises to be the essence that 'defines the man'.

A spokesman for Beckham said: 'We don't distribute to Poundland, they've obviously bought it from somewhere without our knowledge and we cannot stop them from doing that.

'The range is normally stocked in the bigger department stores like Boots for around £25. Poundland must be selling it at a loss as a way of getting people into their stores.'

A surge in the number of shoppers seeking out bargains, has seen record sales at the thriving Poundland chain which has opened 60 new branches.

It has reported that sales at its 528 stores have hit almost £1billion a year while it plans to expand its budget empire with a target of some 1,000 outlets.

The discounter has even sought to win sun-soaked, ex-pat customers in Spain by opening stores in Malaga.and Torremolinos.

The budget chain is also selling Victoria's perfume 'Intimately Beckham' for women in some stores for £8 – which is less than half of the recommended retail price of £20.

Both fragrances can also be found at cut prices by other distributors.

Amazon is selling The Essence for £9.95 and website Fragrance Direct for £9.99 while Boots has reduced the price of the product from £33 to £14.99 in a sale.

Boots and Amazon have also slashed the price tag on the 50ml Intimately Beckham for Her and are both selling it at £11.99.

A Poundland spokeswoman said last night: 'Everything is just £1 at Poundland. However, this is another amazing Christmas treat. The fragrance can't be bought separately.'

A spokesman for David Beckham said that the discounted prices did not mean the fragrance was not a success.

He said: 'The Beckham range sold by Coty is the most successful celebrity fragrance of all time. It has sold over 10 million units across the world to date.'
