Most of Britain’s Olympic and Paralympic sports were celebrating the announcement of funding rises for the next four years but several sports, including swimming, basketball, volleyball and handball, are paying the price for failure with severe cuts to their income.

UK Sport announced a record pot of £347m to be distributed in the run-up to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games with cycling, rowing, boxing, athletics and gymnastics among those given increases.

It is a different story for those 
sports that did not meet their performance targets in London including 
swimming, whose funding is cut to £21.4m from £25.1m, volleyball (down 
to £400,000 from £3.5m), plus basketball, handball, wrestling and table 
tennis, which miss out on funding altogether.

UK
Sport’s target is for Britain to be even more successful in Rio than in
London, where the teams won 65 medals in the Olympics and 120 in the 
Paralympics.

The funding 
body’s chief executive Liz Nicholl said: 'We want to be the first nation
in recent history to be more successful in the Olympics and Paralympics
post-hosting.'

UK Sport’s chairman Sue Campbell admitted some sports would be devastated by the news.

She added however: 'It isn’t about being popular it’s about making tough decisions about where public money goes.'

The
biggest increase of any Olympic sport goes to boxing, a 44% increase, 
to £13.8m, though £9.55m is conditional on sport sorting out some 
internal issues.

Cycling is
up to £30.6m from £26.3m, athletics has a £1.7m increase to £26.8m, 
rowing up from £27.3m to £32.6m, and gymnastics up from £10.8m to 
£14.5m.

Investment in Paralympic sport also rises dramatically, up 43% on London 2012.

Increase: Nicola Adams won one of GB boxing's three gold medals in London and the sport has enjoyed the largest funding growth

Dominant: Britain's cyclists won seven out of a possible 10 gold medals in the Velodrome as well as Wiggins's time trial win

Artistic: The British gymnastics team won four medals and 15-year-old Rebecca Tunney also gave a good performance

Disappointing: Michael Jamieson's 200m breaststroke silver was as good as it got for Britain's swimmers who endured a difficult Olympics
