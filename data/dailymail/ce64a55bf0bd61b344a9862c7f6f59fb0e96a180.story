Blunder: University College has apologised after accidentally sending out results of its worst-performing students in an email

An Oxford University college has upset its students after accidentally sending out a list of the worst performers to hundreds of their fellow undergraduates.

The embarrassing leak revealed the names and grades of students at University College who had the lowest marks in the pre-Christmas exams.

Known as ‘collections’, the exams are used to check whether pupils are on track to a good final grade, but do not go towards their degree mark.

But almost 50 who achieved a 2:2 grade - a mark below 60 per cent - or worse in the Michaelmas collections had their results sent to fellow students.

The information was contained in an Excel document accidentally sent out by Kristiana Dahl, an academic administrator at University College, which counts Stephen Hawking and Bill Clinton among its alumni.

It showed the worst-performing students in the college, as well as their percentage mark and their degree subject.

Officials have not revealed how many students received the email but it is thought it was sent to hundreds at University College - known as ‘Univ’.

Staff quickly asked students to 'please delete the email previously sent out as it contained inaccuracies'.

One of the students affected, who did not wish to be identified, told student newspaper The Tab: “I don’t ever want to do collections again.

'I was pretty gutted after my results last term, but didn’t realise I would be publicly humiliated. I can’t even go into college any more.

'I want a full explanation from the college. I would sue but there are apparently no decent lawyers at Univ.'

Tam Guobadia, a second-year law student said: 'I personally find it quite funny but I understand why some people might be upset.'

Another student said: 'Of course, everyone on the list is just trying to laugh it off.

'But in reality, no one feels comfortable with having something so personal shared with the entire college.

'It’s hard not to feel everyone’s talking about you.'

Abigail Reeves, head of the college's Junior Common Room, apologised to students after a meeting with senior tutor Dr Anne Knowland.

She said: 'Dr Knowland has assured me that the document was sent accidentally and that the disclosure of results was not intentional.

'The member of staff responsible is apparently mortified. The senior tutor has also told me that action will be taken with the Academic office to insure that an incident like this never occurs again.'
