An upcoming dance show called Nothing To Lose is giving plus-sized woman the chance to show off their curvaceous figures and aims to be a demonstration of what an overweight body can do 

Brainchild of director Kate Champion and associate artist Kelli Jean Drinkwater, it will run at the Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne, Australia.

The company's artistic director, Kate, teamed up with filmmaker and activist recognised internationally for her work in radical body politics, Kelli, in order to explore and celebrate the movement of bigger bodies in the show.

Speaking about the production, Kelli said: 'When Kate told me she wanted to create a new piece of dance theatre with a cast of undeniably bigger bodies I was overwhelmed.

'But the response to Nothing to Lose has been positive beyond our wildest expectations.

'We've had huge amounts of interest internationally - from places as far and wide as London to Hong Kong to Buenos Aires.

'It has been overwhelming and also validating to realise that this subject really speaks to people.'

In a video for the Sydney Festival, the choreographer recalled realising that she 'needed to find someone who lives in the bigger body' in order to move forward with her idea. She later enlisted Ms Drinkwater, who worked as a plus-size model.

'I had no idea the level of abuse that a lot of [the show's dancers] experience daily and how they have to prepare themselves to go out in public all the time,' Ms Champion said. 'That's quite shocking.' 

She added that she hopes to create a space where the audience can view the plus-sized dancers in a 'different way and actually just enjoy the physical form moving’.

Nothing to Lose is another example of how body acceptance movements and campaigns have gained popularity over recent years.

Last October, radio producer Whitney Way Thore showcased her amazing dance moves in a series of weight acceptance videos titled A Fat Girl Dancing as a part of her No Body Shame Campaign.

Thore is now starring in her own TLC reality series, My Big Fat Fabulous Life, which premiered on January 13.

And in 2014, a number of women took to social media to share photos of their bikini bodies after plus-size fashion blogger Gabi Gregg posted a picture of herself in a two-piece swimsuit with the hashtag #fatkini.

Miss Gregg has since launched two collections of swimwear for women sizes 10 through 24, with the first selling out within 48 hours.
