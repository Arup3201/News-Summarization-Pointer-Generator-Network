Caterham have raised over £1million in just 48 hours in their controversial bid to make the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

The cash-strapped team’s administrators revealed a plan on Friday to raise £2.35m in order to make the season finale in a fortnight’s time.

The ‘crowdfunding’ scheme calls on fans to contribute a minimum of £1 in exchange for car parts, merchandise and even dinner with one of this year’s drivers; Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi or Swedish rookie Marcus Ericsson.

Caterham need to raise in excess of £2million to make the Formula One season finale in Abu Dhabi 

The administrators at Caterham have launched an initiative in a bid to get the struggling team to Abu Dhabi

£40 - Special Edition Baseball Cap

£225 - A pair of pit team boots

£500 - A pair of pit team overalls

£1,000 - Your name on a race car

£3,000 - Rear wing from 2013 race car

£45,000 - Corporate Hospitality 

And in the hours ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix, where neither Caterham nor Marussia, who went out of business earlier this week are competing, the Leafield-based team had hit seven figures.They have until Friday to raise the cash.

The unique scheme hasn’t appeased all in the sport however, with ringmaster Bernie Ecclestone describing it as a 'disaster' for F1.

The 84-year-old said: 'It's up to the fans if that's what they want to do. I think it's a disaster. We don't want begging bowls. If people can't afford to be in Formula One, they have to find something else to do.

The cash-strapped team have until Friday to accumulate the money required to make the race

'If I sit in a poker game and I can't afford to be there with the other people, I get killed and have to leave. 

'I don't know what they do with their money. I don't spend their money. We just give it to them. 'We give the teams nearly $900 million a year. We don't spend it.'

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner added: ‘Certainly I don't agree with fans having to fund a team.

‘The fans pay to be entertained by the teams, they shouldn't have to pay for a team. The concept of that is wrong and shouldn't be allowed. It's important Formula One doesn't do it's dirty washing in public.’
