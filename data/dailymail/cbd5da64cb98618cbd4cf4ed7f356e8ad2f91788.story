Public sector workers are still earning up to £3,200 a year more than their private sector equivalents.

Even after a three-year squeeze on the millions employed by the state, they continue to enjoy an average ‘pay premium’ of more than six per cent, a report reveals today.

In some parts of the North East, Merseyside and the South West, public sector workers are paid as much as 14 per cent more – or £3,200 a year on average.

However, in central London, the East and South East, the average public sector worker is paid less than they would if they were working in the private sector.

The scale of the regional variations, uncovered by centre-Right think-tank Policy Exchange, will lead to renewed calls to end national pay bargaining for the public sector and have regional scales instead.

Chancellor George Osborne has warned that public sector pay levels are so out of kilter in some regions that they are squeezing out the private sector, and suggested that they should be made ‘more responsive’ to local labour markets.

However, the Liberal Democrats boasted at their annual conference last month that they had blocked Conservative attempts to bring in regional variations.

Today’s report finds that more than 12 per cent of national income – £180 billion – is spent on public sector pay. On average, a public sector worker benefits from a 6.1 per cent pay premium, earning as much as £1,400 a year more than someone in the private sector. Women tend to have larger pay premiums than men.

The average premium has been relatively steady since mid-2010, suggesting that the Coalition’s freeze on public sector pay is starting to address the balance.

The report recommends abolishing national pay deals in favour of a system that reflects local labour markets and rewards performance.

Rebalancing the pay and pensions of public sector workers so that they are in line with the private sector would save £6.3billion a year, the think-tank says.

This could be used to create at least 288,000 private sector jobs in some of the poorest parts of the country.

Matthew Oakley, head of economics and social policy at Policy Exchange, said: ‘Nationalised pay negotiation is not fit for purpose for the modern public sector. It is bad for the economy and bad for public services.

‘We should move to a system where local public sector employers can decide how to negotiate salaries with employees in order to reflect the realities of their local labour market.

‘At the same time as freeing up money for infrastructure and local growth projects, this will enable top performing public sector workers to be paid more.’

But TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Cutting pay in those parts of the country sharing least in the much delayed and rather shallow recovery makes no economic sense. It will make the north-south divide even greater.

‘And it will make inequality within regions greater too, as the biggest losers from these proposals will be low-paid staff in the public sector.

‘We should be spreading the living wage in both public and private sectors, not listening to these divisive and unfair proposals from well-off London think-tank wonks.’

Dave Prentis, Unison general secretary, said the public sector includes a raft of highly skilled jobs that are not represented in the private sector, such as judges, lecturers, doctors, army generals and senior civil servants.

‘The idea that there is a public sector pay premium is a myth and dressing it up with dodgy statistics still won’t make it true,’ he said.

‘The real pay difference is between those at the top and the bottom – the bankers and financiers who are still raking in the bonuses.’

Mr Osborne has announced that pay restraint in the public sector is to continue at least until the next election.

A two-year pay freeze is being followed by a pay rise cap of one per cent for two further years.

And the number of predicted public sector job losses under the Government’s austerity measures has risen to 710,000 by 2016/17.
