Silvio Berlusconi is under investigation by Italian prosecutors for allegedly paying a series of huge lump sums to a call girl in return for her silence over prostitutes attending his parties.

The revelation comes as the embattled former prime minister faces being stripped of his Senate seat following his tax fraud conviction and four-year prison sentence.

It's alleged that Mr Berlusconi paid German-born ex-model Sabina Began - said to be the 'Queen Bee' of his female following - 1.5 million euros (£1.26m) over a period of months for keeping quiet about sending call girls to his parties.

It's alleged that she recruited call girls for parties at Mr Berlusconi's Rome residence - Palazzo Grazioli, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Ms Began, who has previously declared her love for the former prime minister and has 'S.B' tattooed on her ankle as a show of adoration for him, says that the money was a gift and she refutes hiring call girls on his behalf.

The Italian press has unearthed bank records that apparently show that several payments amounting to 1.5 million euros were sent to her by Mr Berlusconi between 2011 and 2012.

Prosecutors are also looking into Mr Berlusconi's dealings with businessman Gianpaolo Taratini, from southern Italy, as there are suspicions that he provided Mr Berlusconi with prostitutes and has been paid 500,000 euros in return for his silence over the matter.

Prosecutors tapped a phone call between the pair in 2011 in which, The Daily Telegraph reports, Mr Berlusconi said: 'Listen Gianpaolo, we need at most two each. Then we can trade. After all, the pussy needs to go around.'

The probe follows Mr Berlusconi being defeated in his attempts to bring down the Italian government after his party voted to support the coalition of premier Enrico Letta, in a major U-turn.

Mr Letta easily won the confidence vote in the Italian Senate, allowing him to keep his five-month old coalition alive.

The actual voting was anticlimactic after former premier Berlusconi acknowledged defeat and said he would support Mr Letta after defections in his party robbed him of the backing he needed to bring down the government.

In brief remarks before a confidence 
vote, Berlusconi said: 'Italy needs a government that can produce 
structural and institutional reforms that the country needs to 
modernise. We have decided, not without internal strife, to vote in 
confidence.'

It was a huge 
setback for Berlusconi. He had demanded his five cabinet ministers quit 
the government and bring it down. He is incensed at a vote planned for 
Friday that could strip him of his Senate seat following his tax fraud 
conviction and four-year prison sentence.

Mr
Letta had hailed his five-month-old government's successes and outlined
his agenda to revive Italy's moribund economy and turn around its 
record unemployment.

Win: Mr Letta easily won the confidence vote in the Italian Senate, allowing him to keep his five-month old coalition alive

He warned MPs in the Senate that Italy 'runs a 
risk, a fatal risk' depending on the choices they make.

'Give
us your confidence to realize these objectives. Give us your confidence
for all that has been accomplished,' he said to applause.

'A confidence
vote that isn't against anyone, but a confidence vote for Italy and 
Italians.'

Berlusconi's 
People of Freedom party has been badly divided ever since Italy's high 
court upheld his tax fraud conviction and sentence in August.

Finished: Berlusconi leaves during a confidence vote at the Senate

But it has
been thrown into chaos after several MPs and his closest ally and 
political heir Angelino Alfano openly defied him and said they would 
support Letta.

Mr Alfano has
served as Mr Letta's deputy in the hybrid government and clearly thinks
it has accomplished a good deal of the Berlusconi party agenda.

Mr
Letta appealed to MPs' sense of duty to not create any more upheaval, 
which has caused Italy untold financial loss in recent years. He 
compared it to Italy's great post-Second World War economic boom that 
was accompanied by comparative political stability.

'The
majority of Italians are telling us - I should say they are yelling at 
us - that they can't take any more of these scenes of bloodshed in the 
political arena, and (politicians) who fight over everything but nothing
ever changes,' he said.

Many
center-left MPs, as well as ordinary Italians, are disgusted that the 
government was essentially teetering over the legal woes of a single 
man, since the crisis began over Berlusconi's attempt to avoid being 
kicked out of the Senate for his tax fraud conviction.

A
law passed in 2012 says anyone receiving sentences longer than two 
years cannot hold public office for six years. Berlusconi has challenged
the law's constitutionality and has accused judges who handed down the 
sentence of trying to eliminate him from Italy's political life.
