Rob Gronkowski has a legitimate shout at being the best tight end in NFL history, but the New England Patriots star says he is having a tough time being taken seriously.

As an alumni of the University of Arizona, a college with a reputation for partying, Gronkowski’s japes are the stuff of legend.

And with the Gronk Party Bus set to arrive in Phoenix, the tales could go on should the Patriots win Sunday’s Super Bowl.

’We’ve got that body armor drink, and we’ve got a couple seating, good music, all that good stuff. You’ve got movies, you’ve got TV. No games, no games actually - movies, though,’ when asked about the vehicle’s contents.

Yet Gronkowski was keen to shake off his party animal reputation.

‘I feel like they underestimate the hard work and dedication behind the scenes for everyone,’ he said during his team’s media duties on Wednesday.

‘Just going in the weight room when it’s your time to work out, the meetings behind the scenes, the practising during the week.

‘I mean, I feel like some people just look at it like you go out there on game day and play, but that’s not really the case. You always have to be taking care of your body throughout the whole week, in the morning and all the way through nighttime, getting sleep.

‘So, people kind of underestimate the hard work and dedication that goes into the week to get prepared for the games on Sunday.’

The last time the Patriots appeared in the Super Bowl, the defeat to the New York Giants in 2012, Gronkowski was hampered by an ankle injury.

He battled injuries for the next two years but is happy to be 100 per cent fit heading into Sunday’s showpiece.

‘It’s a lot better. I remember a few years ago being here, every single question about my ankle. Every four seconds somebody asked me about my ankle. It’s cool to come here, just chill, just worry about the Seattle Seahawks, just worrying about practice and see what I’ve got to do, so it’s a lot better feeling like that. It’s awesome.’
