A woman who fell through a narrow gap between two walls was left stuck there for seven hours because locals thought her screams for help were a ghost.

The woman, who has not been named, was taking a short cut home in Feidong in China's Anhui Province, and had squeezed her way through a tiny gap between two brick walls.

But she hadn't realised that the gap became narrower the further down she went and she soon became stuck.

Spooked: The woman who was mistaken for a ghost is finally rescued after becoming stuck between two walls

Unfortunately when she called out for help, the homeowner living on the other side of the wall assumed she was a ghost and was too terrified to investigate further.

The trapped woman had to endure an entire night trapped between the walls as he cries for help went unanswered.

She was finally spotted by passers-by the following morning. The fire brigade was called and quickly arrived to cut her free.

It took around 20 minutes for them to break down part of one of the walls enough for her to squeeze out.

She emerged looking utterly exhausted, not to mention embarrassed, with tattered clothes and covered in dust.

The firefighters chisel away at the top of the wall as they try to free the woman who at that point had been trapped for seven hours

Nearly free: The woman begins to become visible. Locals had mistaken her for a ghost and she was left jammed between the two walls overnight
