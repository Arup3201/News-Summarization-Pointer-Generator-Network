Acquitted: Roy Cope, 63, stepped down from his job as a deputy headteacher after being subjected to a disciplinary hearing by the school for the alleged assault - despite being cleared in court of any wrongdoing

A deputy headteacher has quit his job before the end of a disciplinary hearing after he was alleged to have slapped an 'uncontrollable' pupil who he described as the worst he had ever taught.

Roy Cope, 63, who has been a teacher for 40 years, left St Bartholomew's CofE Primary School in Blackburn despite being cleared by magistrates of assault.

He was alleged to have held a seven-year-old boy by the wrists and hit him after the child flew into an 'incandescent rage', hitting 10 other pupils.

The boy became 'hysterical and out of control' during a lesson and was sent out for hitting the other children.

One teacher described him as being in a rage and grabbed hold of railings to avoid being taken to Mr Cope's office, screaming 'get off me, get off me'.

Once he finally got to the deputy head's office he sat on the carpet where Mr Cope told him to calm down.

The same teacher then said he saw Mr Cope hit the child and threaten to do it again if he failed to calm down.

He told 
magistrates: 'Mr Cope was not using a technique I knew, but he seemed in
charge. He was being forceful but fair.

'The child's arms were flailing and 
he kept on shouting, getting more and more hysterical. Mr Cope released 
or lost control of the boy's left arm and then he struck him across the 
face.'

But Mr Cope told the hearing: 'As a 
teacher with over 40 years' experience, with a good reputation within 
the school and local community, this allegation has come as a great 
shock to me and caused me and my family great distress.

'Since the boy started school he was a
disruptive and aggressive pupil and frequently disrupted the school. He
is probably the worst of the pupils I have ever taught in 40 years of 
teaching and on occasions he is uncontrollable.

'Whilst in Year 1 it was necessary to remove him from the classroom to stop him attacking pupils. In Class 2 as he became stronger on many occasions he attacked other pupils.

Incident: The seven-year-old boy flew into an 'incandescent rage' at St Bartholomew's primary school in March last year

'It was suggested that in order to 
control volatile incidents the headteacher said that he should be 
removed to another class room. He was hitting children with his 
schoolbag and pinning another to the wall by the throat before 
registration.

'The Chair of Governors was very alarmed at his behaviour.'

He said the boy was often sent to his 
office for bad behaviour and on the day of the incident had been sent 
out of class again for hitting other children.

Mr Cope added: 'We were preparing for 
our production of Wind in the Willows with the eight to 10-year-olds. 
When I got downstairs he wasn't in Class 2, he was outside Class 1 
standing on the corridor shouting at the Class 1 teacher.

'She was telling him to go inside but he was shouting "I don't want to I'm not going to".

He was shouting it very loud indeed. 
The rest of the children were looking out. I held his hand and he was 
still shouting and screaming and because I was holding his hand he was 
shouting "get off me".

'He worked himself into an 
incandescent rage, I knew it was all bluster and knew he would 
eventually calm down. I had to be calm but firm with him.

'He was a bit like a long playing 
record "get off me, get off me", even though I was saying "calm down". I
would say he said it 50 to 100 times repeating it.

'He was throwing himself from side to 
side and rocking on his bottom trying to get away, trying to break free.
He was shouting and children in the hall could hear him.'

As well as being cleared in court of any wrongdoing, Mr Cope has received the support of parents and other staff at the school.

However, he was due to face a disciplinary hearing into the matter and decided to quit, leaving at the end of January.

Despite being cleared of assault he remained suspended until the hearing was over.

He decided after 'careful deliberation' to stand down from the Â£44,000-a-year job.

The alleged incident took place in March last year and Mr Cope said the boy was 'the most badly behaved I have ever taught'.

Speaking of their disappointment that
the school had lost such a valued member of staff, one parent said: 'Mr
Cope is an absolutely outstanding man and has dedicated his life to the
school.

'You would not find a more dedicated 
teacher and all the staff and parents have been 100 per cent behind him.
For his distinguished career to end like this is a disgrace.'

Mark Mackley, headteacher at St 
Bartholomew's, said: 'After careful deliberation, Mr Cope has decided 
that he will not be returning to his position of deputy headteacher and 
has left the employment of the school with effect from 31 January, 
2013.'

Parents spoke of 
their disappointment that the school has lost a member of staff 
described as 'an absolutely outstanding teacher' who had 'dedicated his 
life to St Bartholomew's'.

One said: 'Mr Cope is an 
absolutely outstanding man and has dedicated his life to the school. You
would not find a more dedicated teacher and all the staff and parents 
have been 100 per cent behind him. For his distinguished career to end like this
is a disgrace.'

The incident with the boy happened towards the end of 
classes in March last year while Mr Cope, from Accrington, was involved
in a rehearsal with 80 pupils for a forthcoming 
school production of Wind In The Willows.

At the time of Mr Cope's acquittal Mr Cope's 
son Robin said: 'The family have had overwhelming support over my 
father's case but it should never have come to court in the first place.

'The fact is there is an issue today 
with unruly children and it has come to this where dedicated teachers 
are repeatedly appearing before the courts on their say-so.'

A Lancashire County Council spokeswoman said any allegation had to be investigated and confirmed a disciplinary investigation had been carried out. She refused to comment further about the result.
