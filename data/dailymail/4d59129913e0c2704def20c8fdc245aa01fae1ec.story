A fierce fire has ripped through the dome of a luxury five-star hotel in the Italian city of Venice.

Smoke was seen billowing from the roof of the historic Excelsior Hotel which overlooks the lagoon in the famous European tourism destination.

Fire fighters spent five hours tackling the blaze at the building, which once hosted Hitler when he met Mussolini on his first state visit to the country.

Teams of fire fighters spent five hours trying to put out the flames after 100 guests had to evacuated from the historic building

More than 100 guests at the hotel, where rooms cost around £300-a-night, were evacuated when fire alarms went off.

Fire engines descended on the scene and went about tackling the flames, which had also spread to a number of wooden and plywood tables in the hotel, which opened in 1908.

It has been reported by Nuova Venezia how that section of the building had been closed while work was going on to build a honeymoon suite.

Investigations are ongoing to try and determine the cause of the fire. The building was refurbished in 2013 and is popular with film stars attending the Venice Film Festival

Flames appeared just after midday today engulfing the entire 'Cupola' dome. It is thought it started in the San Marco suite, which has 360 degree views of the sea and lagoon, Corriere della Sera reports.

It is not yet clear how much damage was caused and what started the blaze, but an investigation has been launched. No one is believed to have been injured.

The hotel is set on the beach at Venice Lido and features a large heated outdoor pool as well as a free regular boat service taking guests across the lagoon to St Mark's Square.

It was refurbished in 2013 with new tapestries and carpets and a gym. In the past, the hotel has played host to a number of celebrities attending the Venice film festival.
