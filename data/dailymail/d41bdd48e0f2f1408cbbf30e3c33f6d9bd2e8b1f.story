The League Two clash between play-off rivals Bury and Southend at the JD Stadium had to be abandoned after just seven minutes as torrential rain rendered the pitch unplayable.

The game went ahead despite a heavy downpour prior to the 3pm kick-off but after a short discussion with the managers the referee decided to postpone the match.

The officials planned to bring the players back out after 20 minutes to re-assess the state of the pitch and the weather but, despite the use of rollers during the break, the match was abandoned.

The visiting Southend fans had to make the 500-mile, eight hour round trip from Essex to Lancashire to witness just a few minutes of football and the fixture is now likely to be replayed on a midweek evening.

Bury manager David Flicroft said: 'Absolutely right decision by the ref, he had every right to start the game. Well done to the ref for making the right decision.

'I am gutted for the fans, as it looked like a great turn out by them today. It's tough for the Southend fans now who'll have to make the long trip up on a Tuesday night now.'

Both manager agreed that it was the right decision to call the game off

Southend manager Phil Brown shared Flicroft's sentiments regarding the supporters but was able to take comfort in the fact he didn't have a full-strength side for the crucial fixture.

'I’m disappointed for the fans but it’s a good call for us because we had four players out today,' Brown said. 

'Twenty minutes before the game the pitch was playable and both managers agreed with that. But it was monsoon-like and the rain is still coming down so it was the right decision (to abandon the game).' 

Supporters have been offered a half price ticket for the re-arranged fixture.
