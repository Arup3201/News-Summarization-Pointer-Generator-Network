My latest accessory: Chloe Green with Marc Anthony in LA

When Daddy needs a publicity boost for his latest store opening, his little girl knows exactly what to do.

Topshop heiress Chloe Green simply wheels out her latest beau for the cameras.

Her latest accessory is 44-year-old Latin singer Marc Anthony, ex-husband of Jennifer Lopez and a father of five – just the sort of man guaranteed to attract maximum attention.

At 21, Chloe is a mere two years older than his oldest daughter.

The 21-year-old was pictured cuddling up to Anthony just days after her father Sir Philip Green opened a new Topshop store in Los Angeles.

The singer, who holds the accolade of top-selling tropical salsa artist of all time, was apparently not just there as an ornament.

He wasted no time in telling his 3.2million Twitter followers that he had had the ‘time of my life’ in the new store at The Grove shopping centre in LA.

He wrote: ‘Who ever doesn’t know about #Topshop #Topman in LA has to get on it! Just had the time of my life at The Grove. Amazing!’

The couple have not been dating for long, according to sources, but Anthony is simply the latest in a long line of celebrities to get up close and personal to Miss Green.

Coincidentally, a new man seems to arrive on the scene every time she or sometimes he, could do with a little extra publicity. 

Two months before she signed up to take part in Made in Chelsea she enjoyed a fling with two of the stars of the reality TV show.

In June 2011 she was linked to Spencer Matthews but by July had moved on to Ollie Locke.

By September her romance with Mr Locke was over. She was, however, still in the show and pictured out and about with actor Lucien Laviscount, who no doubt was looking to boost his profile after a stint on Celebrity Big Brother.

Shortly before the launch of the shoe collection she designed in May 2012, she was pictured hugging Premier League footballer Jermain Defoe in the street.

And in December last year, shortly before the Christmas shopping rush, Miss Green was seen with football ‘bad boy’ Djibril Cisse.

Anthony is apparently friends with Chloe’s doting father Sir Philip. In April 2009, when still married to Miss Lopez, he was pictured chatting to Chloe, then 18, and Sir Philip  during a Topshop dinner in New York.

Sir Philip invited Miss Lopez and Anthony on to his yacht on the French Riviera in May 2010. Miss Lopez also joined the Greens at the Los Angeles launch party of Topshop just two weeks ago.

Anthony split from model girlfriend Shannon De Lima a month ago, but clearly has wasted no time in moving on.

Miss Green joined him and his five-year-old twins Max and Emme, from his marriage to Miss Lopez, on a day out at Disneyland in LA.

The heiress, who turns 22 tomorrow, looked relaxed in a double denim combination of Topshop jeans, Current Elliott shirt, Victoria Beckham sunglasses and black biker boots from her own CJG collection as she held hands with her new man.

Anthony, who split from Miss Lopez in 2011, is also father to Cristian, 12, and Ryan, nine, from his first marriage to beauty queen Dayanara Torres.

He has a daughter Ariana, 19, from a previous relationship with Debbie Rosado.
