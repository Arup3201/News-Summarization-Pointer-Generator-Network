High flyer: The Baroness Ashton of Upholland will be transported in style

EU chiefs were yesterday accused of living the ‘high life’ at taxpayers’ expense after signing a £10million deal for the use of private jets to fly them around the world.

Baroness Ashton, the EU’s foreign policy chief, is among the eurocrats who will enjoy use of the jets for their globetrotting.

From tomorrow, the Labour peer will be able to use a choice of aircraft – including the Falcon 7X jet and Boeing 737 – when she travels abroad for EU business.

Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, and Herman van Rompuy, president of the European Council, are among other dignitaries who will benefit from the agreement with Belgian firm Abelag.

The news of the deal – estimated to be worth as much as £10.3million over the next four years – comes after Britain reacted with fury to the EU’s demands to increase its budget by seven per cent.

The Commission’s proposal would increase the Brussels budget by 6.8 per cent to nearly £114billion. Britain’s share, at around 12.5 per cent, would be £16.6billion – a rise of more than £1billion.

Lady Ashton has demanded an extra £23million to run the EU’s foreign service – despite her promise that it would be ‘budget neutral’ when she was appointed as its foreign minister in 2009.

Her 5.7 per cent increase takes the annual bill for EU diplomats and embassies to £422million, at a cost to British taxpayers of £52million in EU contributions.

Speaking of the private-jet deal, Martin Callanan, a senior Tory MEP, said: ‘Coming just days after Commission leaders put forward a preposterous set of budget proposals, claiming they were doing all they could to save money, this confirms they really have no shame.

‘They have lost their moral and financial compass and they are prepared to ensure they get to live the high life, whatever the expense and whatever other people’s hardship.

‘They seem to live in their own little bubble where they are perpetually pampered.’ The European Commission insisted the deal would, in the long term, save money. It argued that the £10.3million sum was essentially a retainer payment and was the maximum that would be spent during the next four years.

A spokesman said: ‘The contract that comes into effect on Tuesday will run for up to four years. It sets a total ceiling of 12million euros over the four years. This is therefore the maximum possible expenditure for all EU institutions... We don’t pay anything when we do not use this service.’

Details of expenditure by European commissioners has revealed that £6.6million has already been spent on the hire of private jets in the four years to 2010.

Last October, Lady Ashton, the vice-president of the European Union, came under fire after she headed off on a trip to a five-star hotel in Australia. As European leaders struggled to save the euro, she flew to Perth where she attended a three-day Commonwealth heads of government meeting.

Critics said the entire trip was a waste of time and totally irrelevant to her job. She has previously been criticised for her slow reaction to international crises.
