When Radamel Falcao smashed a devastating hat-trick past Chelsea in the colours of Atletico Madrid, we longed for his arrival in the Premier League.

This was a player made for the English top-flight; pace, power, panache and potency - Falcao had the ingredients to succeed on these shores.

Now he is here - after a long-term knee injury - but the Manchester United loanee is a sorry imitation of the striker who terrorised the Blues in the European Super Cup of 2012.

Gone are the razor-sharp reactions of mind and body. Gone also is the swagger which was deserving of his superiority, for Falcao was the best centre forward in Europe as he plundered 32 goals for Atletico in the campaign which followed his destruction of Chelsea.

He was the most coveted frontman on the continent but ended up at Monaco. Money – a £52million transfer fee and £10m salary – talked.

It was there that he suffered the cruciate ligament injury which robbed him of a place at the World Cup.

On the evidence of his efforts for United – whom he joined in a £6m loan deal in September – that injury robbed him of a whole lot more than a summer in Brazil.

He has just two goals from 11 appearances and only now does Louis van Gaal appear to trust the 28-year-old with successive starts.

He failed to break Sunday’s stalemate at Spurs and fluffed the one chance which did come his way. The energy and endeavour which was always married to his goals is on the increase, it seems, but strikers are not judged on distance run or tackles made.

Rather, goals are the currency in which they trade and, to that end, Falcao’s return is poor in comparison to his sizeable wage packet.

And therein lies the conundrum for Van Gaal and the United hierarchy.

At 28, is a player whose reputation currently outweighs his return on the pitch – not to mention his salary – really worth a £50m investment to keep at Old Trafford?

You would argue not. The numbers – be it age, goals, fee or wages – do not make business sense.

Better, it seems, already reside within the club. Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have eight goals apiece this term, while playmakers Juan Mata and Angel di Maria have also outscored Falcao.

Then there is James Wilson, the academy product who broke all manner of scoring records at youth level and is nine years Falcao’s junior.

The beauty of the loan agreement is that it serves as a ‘try before you buy’ scenario for United.

Thus far, he has struggled for form and fitness, never a favourable combination. He has five months to persuade his manager and the paymasters at the club that he is worth such a monstrous outlay.

For supporters – those of United and perhaps even beyond – there is the hope that Falcao will come good, that he will unleash that devastating streak which did for Chelsea two years ago and won him so many admirers in this land.

That following, however, is fading fast, as are his chances of remaining at United.
