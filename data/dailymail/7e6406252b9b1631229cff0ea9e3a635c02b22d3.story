When nine-year-old Emma Ross collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest in her school playground, her father could only look on in horror.

She has been fighting for her life in a coma for more than three weeks now and it is feared that she has suffered brain damage.

Her mother Robyn, 36, has spoken of her fear at seeing her little girl lying ‘dead’ in the playground at Heathhall Primary in Dumfries.

She said: ‘I rushed to the school after a friend called me to say Emma had fallen and smashed her nose in the playground.

‘When I arrived I saw Emma lying dead and motionless. She was completely blue and she was not breathing. Her teacher Mrs Black was standing over her giving CPR.

‘It was a complete shock because I had no idea it was so serious. Her dad Lindsay who had gone to pick her up from school was hysterical.

‘Emma is so popular and funny, I miss her so much. I know she is going to pull through. She had a chance to leave me and she didn’t. Three times I was told she was not going to make it, but she is still fighting.’

A priest was called for Emma at one stage, but she pulled through and responded well to treatment.

Both parents have praised the quick actions of Emma’s teacher, Mrs Black, as the emergency first aid may have helped to save her life.

Emma (pictured with her mother, Robyn) has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy - a disease of the heart muscle. This is the same condition that footballer Fabrice Muamba has

Emma, who is in primary five, has now been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, the same disease of the heart muscle that almost killed footballer Fabrice Muamba in 2012.

Robyn who has a younger daughter Evie, 18 months, said that Emma has never been ill or admitted to hospital before.

She said: ‘Emma is such an athlete, she loves mountain climbing and she is always dancing and playing outdoors. She suffers from a very rare heart disease, there are only two or three cases a year.

Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle.

It can run in families and can affect one or many members of a family.

There are three different types of cardiomyopathy and each affects the size and shape of the heart.

They can also affect the heart's electrical system.

There is a small risk of sudden death in people with cardiomyopathy.

‘It’s the same disease as Fabrice Muamba who collapsed on the pitch. He was out for 87 minutes, but Emma was passed out for 44 minutes.

‘The whole community has been so supportive and she has been sent hundreds of cards and messages of love. When I go and visit her in the hospital she definitely knows that it is me. 

‘It’s all down to Emma now, her life is in her hands.’

She has been critically ill at Yorkhill Children’s Hospital in Glasgow since her cardiac arrest on February 27.

Doctors say she could be in a coma for months, and it’s feared she has suffered brain damage.

A cardiac arrest occurs when there is a problem with the heart's electrical system.

It is different to a heart attack which occurs when there is a problems with the heart's 'plumbing'.

Emma was taken first to Dumfries Infirmary before being transferred to Yorkhill which has a paediatric intensive care unit.

‘All the paramedics were distraught, but they refused to give up on her. They were brilliant. They paralysed her and put her in an induced coma before giving her a scan,’ said Robyn.

She was going to be taken by helicopter but the weather changed and she was taken by ambulance.

Emma's family remain confidence and hopeful that she will make a full recovery

Her mother has spoken out about the lack of a specialist retrieval team which serves the area surrounding Dumfries.

‘It took nine hours for Emma to receive the proper medical help as she had to be transferred to a children’s hospital in Glasgow.

'I think this is absolutely disgusting and something should definitely be done to make sure the process is more efficient.

‘It was such a critical time and I felt like a lot of time was wasted waiting around for her to be transferred to the best place. More damage could have been prevented.’

Contrary to popular belief, a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack.

A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system.

It is caused by an abnormal rhythm, or arrhythmia.

Anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning.

Symptoms include unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, lack of pulse and stopping breathing.

In contrast, a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked.

This causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert.
