The first letter sent by Airmail from Britain to Australia has been unveiled, along with a host of retro travel posters to celebrate 80 years of the Kangaroo Route.

British Airways has marked the 80th anniversary of its regular mail service between the UK and Australia - which falls on December 8 - by releasing the posters which encouraged Britons to make the journey Down Under. 

The first Airmail letter was sent on December 8, 1934, when Imperial Airways, a precursor to British Airways, began its regular weekly mail service between England and Australia.

Generations of families have kept in touch via the UK-Australia Airmail post service from British Airways

The first letter was successful sent by airmail on December 8, 1934 - almost 80 years ago

British Airways still has the envelope of one of the first letter sent that day, to the Right Hon Sir Auckland Geddes, which arrived in Brisbane 13 days later. 

His son, Eric Campbell Geddes, was then the chairman of Imperial Airways.

The weekly mail service, which began exactly 80 years ago to the day, on December 8, 1934, started off as a partnership between three different airlines; Imperial Airways, Indian Trans-Continental Airways and Qantas Empire Airways. 

Imperial Airways and Indian Trans-Continental Airways together flew Airmail from Karachi to Singapore, with stops in Jodhpur, Delhi, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon, Bangkok and Alor Star. 

Qantas Empire Airways flew the Airmail the final leg from Singapore to Brisbane, via Darwin. 

The delivery service started off as a partnership between three different airlines; Imperial Airways, Indian Trans-Continental Airways and Qantas Empire Airways

On April 13, 1935, British Airways, then operating as Imperial Airways, and Qantas Empire Airways opened the 12,754 mile route for passengers. The journey took 12 days and a single fare from Croydon to Brisbane cost £195 one-way.

Now British Airways, the only European carrier flying between Heathrow and Sydney, makes the daily flight from London to Sydney in just over 22 hours.

John Chisholm, Airmail product manager for IAG Cargo, the cargo arm of British Airways and Iberia, said: 'Over the last 80 years British Airways has played a huge part in keeping families, friends, businesses, diplomats and governments in touch with one another, by providing the vital link for Airmail between the UK and Australia. 

To this day, the postal service carries 34,000 tonnes of Airmail annually - though now it's a direct flight

In 1934, Imperial Airways was responsible for Airmail between London and Karachi, Pakistan

'We're very proud to carry the Royal Mail logo on the side of every British Airways aircraft. Australia is still one of our biggest airmail cargo destination and we transport over 500,000 kgs of letters and parcels a year between the Sydney and London.

 'We expecting demand to build very quickly as everyone rushes to try and beat the Post Office's December 4 postal deadline for mailing cards and presents to Australia in time for Christmas!'

While the number of letters posted has fallen, the number of parcels sent between the UK and Australia has increased, thanks to the growing popularity of ecommerce sites and internet shopping.

IAG Cargo carries approximately 34,000 tonnes of Airmail annually, including those letters intended for the is British and US military, deployed overseas. 

Then, Imperial and Indian Trans-Continental Airways carried it along to Singapore with Quantas finishing the route to Brisbane
