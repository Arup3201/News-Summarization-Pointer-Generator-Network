Melanie Hemmings opted for IVF treatment to have a child when she couldn't find a suitable father

Midwife Melanie Hemmings always dreamed of having a baby of her own.

As a young woman she was sure she would find 'the one' before she was ready to become a mother.

But life had other plans and following an eight year marriage, a divorce, and several years of dating she found herself alone, childless and very broody at 34.

While investigating her options she discovered that she had some major fertility issues and that time was running out.

Today, after undergoing three rounds of IVF, Melanie is a single mother to six-month-old Jasmin, and she couldn't be more delighted.

Interviewed on This Morning today Melanie told hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'I remember from the age of 24 thinking: "This is it, I am ready as a woman,"

'I was married for eight years but I knew he wasn't the right one to have children with and always assumed that I would meet somebody else after we got divorced.'

'At the age of 34 I decided to start looking into donor insemination. I wasn't interested in IVF, and didn't think I would need it.

'I didn't know then that there was a problem with my fertility and still thought that I might meet somebody, I was only 34.'

Unfortunately Melanie didn't meet anybody and with her biological clock ticking she decided to have a private fertility test to take stock of her options. She was diagnosed with a Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) problem and doctors at the clinic confirmed that time was running out.

Melanie said: 'I remember hearing the words "You haven't got a day to waste."

'My blood ran cold and I realised that this might not happen.'

Melanie found an American sperm donor and discovered that she was pregnant on Christmas Eve 2012 following three rounds of IVF.

Her daughter Jasmin was born in September 2013.

TV host Holly, pregnant with her third child and clearly besotted with baby Jasmin during the interview, said: 'I would have done exactly the same thing.'

Dr Geeta Nargund, a Harley Street 
fertility specialist appearing on the show with Melanie added: 'Most 
women want to have a natural baby. Plan B, for a younger woman, can be 
to freeze their eggs.

'But when the clock is ticking faster and it is 'now or never' more women are considering donor sperm.

'There has been a change in society and women today want to have choices'.

Melanie says: 'You have to be in the right 
frame of mind. If you think you can do it, which I did, then go for it. You won't regret it, and you don't 
want to go through life thinking "what if?"'

'The 2004 guideline recommends that couples in which the woman is aged 23-39 years at the time of treatment and who have an identified cause for their fertility problems or who have infertility of at least three years' duration should be offered up to three stimulated cycles of IVF treatment.

The new guidance [May 2012] recommends that in women aged 40 to 42 years who have not had IVF treatment, consider one full cycle of IVF, with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection, where there is no chance of pregnancy with expectant management ('absolute infertility') and where IVF is the only effective treatment.

NICE also recommends that unstimulated intrauterine insemination should be considered as a treatment option for people who are unable to, or would find it very difficult to have vaginal intercourse because of a physical disability or psychosexual diagnosis who are using partner or donor sperm, people with conditions that require specific consideration in relation to methods of conception, and people who are in same-sex relationships.

HIV treatments have improved significantly since the original guideline was published, and the updated draft guideline recommends that the transmission of HIV to the female partner is negligible through unprotected sexual intercourse when certain criteria are met.'
