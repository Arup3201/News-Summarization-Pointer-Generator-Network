Police have arrested 30-year-old man for breaking into an elderly Oklahoma couple's home and robbing them after the couple's granddaughter made a Facebook posting that led to a tip-off.

Police say Michael Lank robbed Beki Akins' grandparents at knifepoint on Tuesday afternoon in their Broken Arrow home and made off with various valuables, including cash, checks, credit cards and the couple's wedding rings.

Upon learning about the home invasion, Akins posted a furious Facebook status update with all the details of the crime including a description of the thief's car, his appearance, approximate age and attire.

The cause was quickly taken up by the Facebook community and Akins' post was shared almost 10,000 times - 8,000 of those within 10 hours of the crime taking place.

Akins' post made it onto the computer screen of Ken Reddick of nearby Tulsa who became suspicious of his brother-in-law Lank.

'When I saw the Facebook post, I contacted Akins and her family and spoke with them, then contacted Broken Arrow police and spoke with a detective for a long period of time,' Reddick told Tulsa World.

According to News on 6, when police arrived at Lank's home to interview him in relation to the crime, he still had the couple's credit cards in his pockets.

Detectives say Lank arrived at Akins' grandparents' home at 1:30pm Tuesday where her grandfather was home alone.

He allegedly held the 84-year-old at knifepoint while he walked him from room to room, ransacking the house.

'He physically assaulted my 
grandfather multiple times and in great description told him what he was
going to do to him,' Beki Akins' Facebook post reads.

'The threats this man made were so horrific that my granddad will not repeat them.'

When Akins' grandmother arrived home from the store, she was also allegedly assaulted by Lank as he made his escape.

Lank was arrested Wednesday with bail set at $52,500.

News on 6 reports he is also under suspicion for another robbery in September in which he allegedly stole jewelry from friends as they waited for him at a bar and then pawned it.

Lank faces charges of first-degree robbery by force or fear, stolen property and false declaration of ownership.

Community: Facebook users rallied around Akins, spreading her message far and wide

The Broken Arrow Police Department told Tulsa World that while sharing of information is important for solving crimes, social media speculation can sometimes hinder investigations.

'Friends and family members of the suspect could see that and alert the individual we are out there looking for them,' Calhoun said.

'The suspect then could try to hide, run away or even destroy evidence. We always want the public to contact the police first.'

Beki Akins is unrepentant.

'Without the power of social media, this guy would still be on the street trying to hurt someone else,' she told Tulsa World.
