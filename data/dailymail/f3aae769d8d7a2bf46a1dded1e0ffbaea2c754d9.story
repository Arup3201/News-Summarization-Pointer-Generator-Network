An historic pier that has played host to some of the biggest names in show business is being sold - and is expected to fetch the same as a three-bedroom semi.

South Parade Pier in Southsea, near Portsmouth, comes complete with two bars and yet is going under the hammer with a guide price of just £210,000.

It is estimated that the buyers of the 
pier would be faced with a bill of £2 million to restore the property to
its former glory.

The pier, which was used in preparation for the D-Day landings, is one of only 55 private piers left in Britain.

The sale follows recent difficulties experienced by its owners Fred Nash and Dawn Randall, with the pier going into administration twice in the past 18 months as well as being partly closed because of safety fears.

Rare: South Parade Pier is one of just 55 private piers left in Britain but is being auctioned with a guide price of just £210,000

Closed: The Victorian structure closed earlier this year amid safety concerns and the auctioneers admit it does investment.

Potential: Auctioneer Rob Marchant, from Clive Emson, said with a bit of investment there is no reason why the pier's two venues 'can't be successful again'

The Victorian structure, which was 
completed in 1878 and officially opened by Prince Edward,  boasts a 
colourful history including three fires.

The last fire was in 1974 during the filming of the rock opera Tommy and, in a scene from the film involving Oliver Reed, smoke is visible.

The Victorian pier began life at a time when Disraeli was Prime Minister as a terminal for ferries travelling to and from the Isle of Wight, but in 1904 it suffered its first fire and was completely rebuilt at a cost of £85,000.

The new 'pleasure pier' became a centre for entertainment and later boasted a 1,200 seat theatre that attracted the biggest names of the day.

At the outbreak of war the pier was requisitioned by the government and it played a key role in the D-Day preparation and embarkation.

After the war it attracted heroes of the age including Frankie Howerd and Peter Sellers, then it was rebuilt again in 1967 following a second fire.

After that, stars including David Bowie and Genesis played there and after the 1974 fire the pier was rebuilt in sympathy with its history and it now it boasts several venues.

The sale is being handled by Clive Emson
land and property auctioneers which describes it as a "unique opportunity
to acquire a substantial freehold Victorian pier for restoration".

In recent years, the pier has consisted of an amusement arcade, shops and two venues which have hosted concerts and nightclubs including a show by Damon Albarn's project The Good, The Bad and The Queen in 2007.

There is the 'Gaiety Suite' with a capacity of 750 that includes a stage, dressing rooms, kitchens and bar, and also a smaller licensed bar with a capacity of 400.

Fires: The pier has a colourful history including three fires. In 1974, smoke can be seen pouring from the structure during a scene in rock opera Tommy, in which the pier featured

Opportunity: Auctioneers believe the pier can be brought back to life as a top local attraction. It comes complete with two bars that can hold more than 1,000 people

Legends: The Gaiety Lounge Show Bar played host to big names such as David Bowie, Manfred Mann and Genesis during the early 1970s

A substantial basement that has lain unused for many years is also included.

And there is the 'open east passage' that leads to the southern end of the pier that used to house fairground-style stalls, rides and crazy golf.

It also has a boardroom, a fishing platform and stunning views across the Solent and the Isle of Wight beyond.

The unusual lot is among 135 being sold through Clive Emson, the regional land and property auctioneers.

Earlier this year the pier closed and does require investment. However, experts believe the building has the potential to become a major attraction once again.

It will go under the hammer on Wednesday, December 12, at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton with a guide price of £190,000 to £210,000.

History: The pier was built in 1878 and has hosted a host of show business favourites such as Mr Bean and The Who. It can be seen in its full former glory in this picture taken in 1935

Busy: The Balmoral leaves the pier in 1935. By the turn of the century, it had become very busy with steamers calling in up to four times an hour.

Birdseye: An aerial view of the pier taken in 1936 - three years before it was requisitioned by the military and used as a depot. It was also deliberately damaged so it could not be used in the case of invasion

Change of fortune: While crowds would flock to the pier in the 1940s to see acts such as Primo Scala and His Accordion Band, left, in 2012 passersby can see the fading signs and closed shutters of a shop on the pier promenade. In April this year the structure was shut to the public because of safety concerns

Postcard: A picture of South Parade Pier during its heyday

Former glory: The pier used to boast the 1,200 Pavilion Theatre but much of the building was destroyed in a 1967 fire

Grand: The 600ft pier, pictured in 1908, was designed by local entrepreneur G.E. Smith

Bandstand: Following the rebuild after the first fire, the pier boasted a bandstand, pictured, and wind-screens to shield visitors from strong gusts

Rob Marchant, from Clive Emson, said: 'The pier offers huge scope, but needs investment, and might be snapped up for the price of a three-bedroom semi.

'It has two venues that in more recent times have held concerts and events, and there is no reason why they can't be successful again.

'Other privately-owned piers have shown they can be commercially viable and this is a great looking pier with magnificent views.

'It also comes with a long and interesting history and it remains a Victorian pier that still has a long life ahead of it despite its age.

'I'm sure there is an investor out there who could revive the fortunes of this grand old structure.'

Details of the freeholder have not been disclosed.

A spokesman for the National Piers Society said: 'South Parade pier dates from 1879 and has a distinguished history.

'It is a listed structure and needs someone who can restore it to its former glory while at the same time appealing to 21st century consumers.

'Given its existing facilities the possibilities are enormous.'

Flames: The pier building was engulfed in fire and smoke which spread after curtains were accidentally set alight during filming for Tommy

Inferno: Sunbathers watch as the flames spread along the pier after the fire started during filming for Tommy

Destroyed: Smoke and flames can be seen billowing from the roof of the pier building after it caught fire during filming for rock opera Tommy in 1974

Disaster: It is believed the fire started when a spotlight set some curtains on fire during a scene with Oliver Reed. Firefighters managed to stop the whole structure being destroyed but large parts of it were lost to the flames
