A 40-year-old woman tackled a 20-year-old man fleeing from police in Washington state, then taunted him about being taken down by a grandmother.

Becky Powell told The Tri-City Herald she was driving by Wednesday as Joseph Lewis Fry tried to run away from police.

Powell told the newspaper she told her husband to drive faster before she got out to confront the man.

Scene: Fry reportedly ran from police near Columbia Center Boulevard and 240, according to The Tri-City Herald

'I got into a football stance and said, "You're going to stay here,"' Powell told the newspaper. 'He stiff-armed me and I just wrapped him up and threw him on the ground.'

Powell told the newspaper she pulled down his shorts in the process.

She told The Tri City Herald she got help keeping Fry down.

'I whispered in his ear, "How does it feel to be taken down by a mother of five and a grandmother of three?,"' she told the newspaper.

There was an outstanding warrant for Fry's arrest, the newspaper reported.

Richland's Capt. Mike Cobb told The Tri City Herald 'We appreciate the assistance, but we don't want to have people get involved because they can get hurt.'
