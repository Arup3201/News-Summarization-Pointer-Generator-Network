A unique manuscript bearing celebrated writer Thomas Hardy's only known attempt at a song is to be sold at auction.

The faded document features lyrics and a melody scrawled in pencil by the author behind classic works including Jude The Obscure and Far From The Madding Crowd.

Hand written in pencil in 1922, it is expected to fetch at least £6,000 when it goes under the hammer tomorrow.

Rare: The faded paper features lyrics by the acclaimed writer for his tune 'O I Won't Lead A Homely Life'

Several
composers have written their own music to Hardy's poems in the past, but
no such effort by the great writer himself has come to light - until 
now.

Hardy wrote the words to O I Won't Lead A Homely Life on white paper beneath a sixteen-bar D major melody.

The music is thought to be based on one of the tunes Hardy played on the violin as a young man while he was a member of the choir at Stinsford Church near Dorchester.

In the unique music manuscript, Hardy notes alternative lyrics to the last line of the song - 'And sunk and sad was she' - were it to be sung by a woman.

The line: 'And sad was life for me' is scrawled above the original lyrics in red.

The author wrote a note saying: 'If sung by a woman the words in red may be used.'

The document, the only Hardy music manuscript in existence today, will be sold at Bonhams in London tomorrow.

It is being sold by manuscript dealer Roy Davids, 70.

The document was once owned by Sydney Cockerell, who was the literary executor of Hardy's will following his death in 1928.

Mr Davids, from Great Haseley, near Oxford, said: 'It says on the manuscript "To an old air".

'This means he has written the poem and the music in his hand writing, but using an old tune that he would have remembered.

'It's the only manuscript for a poem of his own that has music attached to it, he didn't compose the music, he took it on.

'He may have adjusted the tune but we just don't know.

'However, this is the only one with music and lyrics in his hand, he destroyed a lot of drafts, so this is very rare.

'Hardy was a very good musician, he played the violin from his childhood and he remembered old tunes.

'He had a fantastic memory and would have known all the popular tunes of the day and his family went to local glee clubs and they played for hours.'

Hardy grew up in a musical family and played the violin like his uncle, grandfather and father, who taught him to read music notation.

He continued to play the violin and perform concerts after becoming a celebrated author with his classic novels like Tess Of The D'Urbervilles and the Mayor Of Casterbridge.

He published his first poetry collection, Wessex Poems, in 1898 but he was not recognised as an influential poet until the 1950s.

Mike Nixon, secretary of the Hardy Society, said: 'I think this document has the wow factor, it's genuine, and was written on the back of a circular dated 23 August 1922.

'It belonged to Sydney Cockerell, who was the literary executor when Hardy died, and he worked with his second wife Florence to clear out Hardy's stuff.

'It's extremely rare and very exciting. It's the only manuscript like this that we know of.'

Thomas Hardy was born in a hamlet in Stinsford, Dorset, in 1840, to father Thomas, a stonemason, and Jemima, a well-read woman who educated her son until he went to his first school in Bockhampton at the age of eight. Despite displaying academic potential from an early age, the cost of university was beyond the means of the Hardy family and Thomas' formal education came to an end at 16 when he became a local architect's apprentice.

After training as an architect Hardy moved to London in 1862, where he enrolled in King's College, before returning to his beloved Dorset five years later to devote himself to writing.

The success of his 1874 novel Far From The Madding Crowd was such that he could give up architectural work and concentrate on the literary career that would see him go on to produce The Mayor Of Casterbridge, Tess Of The D'Urbervilles and Jude The Obscure among other novels.

Hardy created some controversy with his sympathetic portrayal of a 'fallen woman' in Tess, while the sexual references in Jude The Obscure saw some booksellers covering copies with brown paper bags.

His disgust at the criticism levelled at two of his best works led Hardy to give up writing fiction altogether in the 1900s.
