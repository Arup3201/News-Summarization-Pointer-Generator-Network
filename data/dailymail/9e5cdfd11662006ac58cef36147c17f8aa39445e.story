A school pupil who dyed her hair red has been banned from lessons for a week until the colour ‘settles down’.

Teachers took action against Kirsty Crooke's 'extreme' hair colour after she arrived at Buttershaw Business & Enterprise College in West Yorkshire with deep crimson roots.

The 14-year-old GCSE student’s furious mother Natalie Bussey, insists the school has overreacted by banishing her daughter to a 'green room' away from other pupils while the colour loses its impact.

Miss Bussey, 36, from nearby Wisbey, claims her daughter’s hair had been dyed for more than a year and it was only when she turned up with the roots re-dyed that staff told her it was too bright.

She said: ‘Children should be allowed to express themselves, it’s not a bad colour.

‘I’d
understand if it was blue. I don’t understand why they’ve pulled her 
out of a week’s worth of lessons for having her roots done. She should 
have been in lessons. I’m livid.’

She added: 'She was depressed because her hair looked greasy when it was brown.

‘Now she has to be taught in the room where the unruly pupils go and is worried about how she will catch up when she gets back to normal lessons.

‘The school says they have to have natural coloured hair but most of the pupils have died hair and some of the teachers have bright purple hair.

‘The staff should be more worried about teaching children than what colour their hair is.’

Kirsty, who has just started studying for her GCSEs, said: ‘It is a crucial time for me and I am very frustrated.

‘I just want to be back in class but I don't see why I have to change my hair because of school.

‘I dyed it red because it is the only colour which suits my natural one which is dark brown.’

Miss Bussey said her daughter had been told she would have to remain in the green room for a week until her hair colour ‘settled down’.

A statement released by the school on behalf of head teacher Richard Hughes after being contacted by Mail Online said: 'We have established very high standards of uniform at BBEC. 

'We extend out high standards in uniform to general appearance and take time to reinforce this with our students. 

'Our expectations are communicated in the prospectus, in letters to parents and, if required, in our weekly newsletter.  We also welcome discussions with parents about this if the need arises.'

According to a notice on the school’s website, staff ‘challenge extreme hair styles and colour – we expect a natural hair colour and smart appearance for school.

It adds: ‘The school uniform standards are high.

We are responsible for students on their journey to and from school so we also check that our uniform is worn correctly on leaving the school site – we insist on blazers, ties and black shoes being worn and shirts tucked in to support our high standards within the community.’

Uniform consists of a blazer, school tie, plain collared white shirt, black trousers and black shoes.

The school has taken similar action against pupils thought to be in breach of the rules.

Earlier this year 16-year-old Nicole Howard was also banned from class at the school for her deep red-coloured hair.
