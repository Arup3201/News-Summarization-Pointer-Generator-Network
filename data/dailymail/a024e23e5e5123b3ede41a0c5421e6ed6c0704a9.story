Tariq Ahmad, 35, who worked at Nur-Ul-Islam Academy, Florida, has been accused of the sexual abuse and rape of two middle school female pupils

Police are hunting the former head teacher of  a private Islamic school accused of the sexual abuse and rape of two middle school female students.

Tariq Ahmad, 35, who worked at Nur-Ul-Islam Academy, Florida, has been charged with five first degree counts after the alleged abuse which left one student needing 'substantial surgical repair'.

The girls were  aged 14 and 15 when Ahmad allegedly forced them into sexual relationships, according to a lawsuit.

Their attorneys said Ahmed would use text messages, social media and even code on the chalk boards in the classroom to set up meetings with the girls.

They also claim the Academy officials knew of Ahmed's illegal conduct for years and did nothing until now.

Pembroke Pines police said the alleged incidents occurred between 2006 and 2008, but the pupils only came forward after years of therapy.

In a statement, the school said: 'Recently, we have become aware of disturbing allegations regarding a former teacher of Nur-ul-Islam Academy.

'These allegations relate to alleged acts of the teacher six to eight years ago, which did not occur on the school's premise, concerning at least one former student of the Academy.

'Upon learning of these allegations, the Academy immediately suspended the teacher's employment, barred him from any further contact with Academy students and has since terminated his employment with the Academy.

'Although none of the acts are alleged to have occurred on the Academy's campus, such acts, if true, clearly violate the conduct policy of the Academy, along with being a gross dereliction of the high level of moral character the Academy expects from its faculty.

'The Academy's primary concern is to foster a safe and caring environment for all of its students, in which they can flourish personally and academically.

A LinkedIn profile in Ahmad's name said he most recently served as the 'head of high school' at the academy, where he started working in August 2006

'The Academy, therefore, has undertaken a full review of its policies to determine what, if anything, needs to be done to further ensure the safety of our students.

'In the spirit of Islamic teachings, we offer prayers for the well-being of all our students, current and former.'

Attorney Scott Mager said: 'There was significant sexual abuse, intercourse and other inappropriate behaviour such that one of the students had to have substantial surgical repair of that (private) area. It's horrific.

'He would use the chalk board to arraign for times and places to meet victims after school,' said attorney Michael Dolce.

The attorneys claim Nur-Ul-Islam Academy officials knew of Ahmed's illegal conduct for years and did nothing until now.

'They knew in 2008. What do they do? Absolutely nothing, expect accuse the kid of doing it. What do they do, they blame, they cover up, they don't tell the parents,' said Mr Mager.

Pembroke Pines Police are currently looking for Ahmad who allegedly fled the jurisdiction after he was made aware of his pending charges.

Sergeant Carlos Corretjer said: 'There is an investigation, it's still an open case,' Corretjer said. 'We're still trying to locate him.' 

The attorneys for the two students are asking anyone who may have information as to where Ahmed might be to contact Pembroke Pines Police immediately. 

A LinkedIn profile in Ahmad's name said he most recently served as the 'head of high school' at the academy, where he started working in August 2006.
