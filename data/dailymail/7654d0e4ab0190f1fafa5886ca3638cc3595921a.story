A café owner was forced to shut up shop for three days after bungling council officials erected a fairground ride just inches from his  window.

Paul Meakin, 31, turned up to work on Monday to find the huge structure blocking the entrance to his family-run cafe in Grantham, Lincolnshire. 

Workers had positioned the carousel-style attraction so close to the front door that it could not even be fully opened.

Taken for a ride: A café owner in Grantham, Lincolnshire, was forced to shut up shop for three days after the local council put up a fairground carousel ride just inches from his shop window

Sandwiched in: Workers had positioned the carousel-style attraction so close to the front door of Cafe Leo that it could not even be fully opened

And even though the council apparently agreed the positioning was rather inconvenient, officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up for the event. 

Mr Meakin now has to wait until tomorrow, the end of the local Mid-Lent Fair, to re-open the cafe.

He said: 'What customer wants to sit having a coffee and look out the window at the back end of a giant fairground ride. It was just really inconsiderate to say the least.

'Everybody thought we were closed anyway. You couldn't get anywhere near the shop really. It was unbelievable.

'It was literally 3ft away from the window. Who could ever think that was a good idea?' 

Mr Meakin, who runs the cafe with wife Jessica, said the 'barmy' decision forced him to close the cafe, a move which he said cost his business at least £1,000.

Clear view: Mr Meakin could barely see out of the window after the ride was put up directly outside the cafe 

Prettier sight: The area where Mr Meakin usually puts tables and chairs (pictured) for al fresco diners was also completely taken over

He claimed the ride had so badly obstructed the view that the entire premises was plunged into darkness.

And the area where Mr Meakin usually puts tables and chairs for al fresco diners was also completely taken over by the attraction.  

He added: 'I had no choice but to close on health and safety grounds. Takings are down over a £1,000 at least.

'My worry was if we had to evacuate a hoard of people would just have been blocked off by a ride and a lamppost.

'The council just don't seem to consider small local businesses here. It was a barmy decision.' 

Baffled: Paul Meakin, 31, pictured with his wife and business partner Jessica, said he had to close the business for most of the week, a move which cost him around £1,000 in profit

Mr Meakin was forced to close the café early on Monday afternoon. It remained closed all day Tuesday, Wednesday and today.

He is due to reopen tomorrow, once the fair has ended. 

He said: 'The ride position was just not acceptable so we left it until the council came back and had a proper look.

'When somebody from the council came they agreed and said it's unacceptable so I don't know how someone could have said it was before. 

'I used to get nervous about the fair coming but because the past few years it's been the same ride it didn't cause me any concern.

Even though South Kesteven District Council agreed the ride (pictured in use at the fair) had been positioned incorrectly, Mr Meakin said officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up

'In terms of compensation the council said they would just look into it.

'We asked to see copies of the risk assessments so we knew we weren't liable if anything happened but they said they couldn't provide them.' 

He added: 'We have been here for four years and it's been the same ride every year but it's been in a sensible place. 

Regular customer Frank Rhimes, 66, said: 'Somebody at the council needs their heads examining.

'I couldn't believe it when I turned up for my daily coffee and saw this massive ride looming over the shop. It just makes you wonder who makes these kind of decisions.'

A South Kesteven District Council spokeswoman said: 'We are facilitating a solution between the showman responsible for the ride and the cafe owner.'
