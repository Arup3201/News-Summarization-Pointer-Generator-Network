This pair of pole-dancing droids bring a whole new meaning to 'Robot moves' as they prepare to strut their stuff for visitors at a computer exhibition.

The life-size white robots are set to be
 among the most popular attractions at the international CeBIT expo in 
Hannover, Germany when it opens to the public tomorrow.

With surveillance camera-shaped lights for heads the humanoids shimmied around a pair of poles to music provided by another robot acting as DJ.

And an engineer was on hand to make sure the robots looked their best as they performed, giving one of the pair a quick clean with some police.

The robots first appeared at the expo in 2012, but proved so popular that they have returned this year among visitors to the trade fair that they were brought back for this year's four-day event, which will be formally opened tonight by German chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron.

The dancers, which cost around Â£2,500 to hire, were made out of old car parts and were designed by British artist Giles Walker, with their sultry moves controlled by a computer.

Other exhibitors preparing for the event included Cornish company RoboThespian, which was also showing off their humanoid robots.

Great Britian is the partner nation for this year's CeBIT, which is the world's largest technology fair, attracting exhibitors and visitors from across the globe.

Prestige: The four-day event will be formally opened tonight by German chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron
