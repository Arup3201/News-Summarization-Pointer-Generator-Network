World Cup organisers and Fifa are under pressure after TV viewers spotted hundreds of empty seats at opening games that were supposed to be sold out. 

Except for the opening game between Brazil and Croatia, most matches have been played in unfilled stadiums.

Switzerland played Ecuador on Sunday in the Arena Brasilia which as a capacity of 72,500 but it appeared to be only two-thirds full.

Reports claim many fans were still outside waiting when the match kicked off.

However, Fifa said the official figure of those in attendance was 68,351. 

Meanwhile, those watching at home spotted hundreds of empty seats during the Spain Netherlands match on Friday and England versus Italy on Saturday.

With just hours to go before the Argentina and Bosnia Herzegovina kick-off on Sunday night at the Maracana stadium, tickets were still available online priced at £80.  

Tickets to see Bosnia Herzegovina play Iran in Salvador next week which cost £110 remain largely unsold.

A Fifa spokesman told The Independent that a total of 2.9 million tournament tickets had been allocated with only 9,327 remaining. 

However, large numbers of tickets distributed to Football Associations around the world often go unsold.

England is believed to have sold all 2,500 of its official allocation of tickets for the Saturday game while Italy were only reported to have sold 200 of theirs and so returned the rest.

Last week it emerged that more than 1,000 fans were forced to switch seats after stadium building delays and changes to signage compelled a reconfigurement of some seating plans.

Emails were sent to 1,376 fans telling them to exchange their tickets for others of the same category but in a different section of several of the 12 tournament stadiums.

A FIFA media spokesman said that officials had contacted ticketholders in advance to prevent confusion or delays on match days and that the changes affected only a tiny proportion of the tickets sold.

Protesters have been staging demonstrations against Brazil spending £7billion of public money on the tournament.
