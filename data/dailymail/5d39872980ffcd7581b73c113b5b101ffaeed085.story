Leslie Podd has been jailed for throwing £40,000 of drugs into HMP Northumberland

The brother of a prison inmate has been caught on CCTV hurling £40,000 worth of cannabis, cocaine and vodka over a jail fence to help pay off a drug debt racked up by his sibling.

Leslie Podd chucked the drugs and alcohol in empty sports drinks bottles, along with syringes and mobile phones, over the wall of HMP Northumberland. 

The haul included 1.5 kilos of cannabis, worth up to £22,500 in prison, as well as cocaine, diazepam, subutex tablets, temazepam, steroids and seven mobile phones.

Podd had been persuaded to carry out the offence to help pay off a drug debt for his brother, a prisoner in HMP Durham, Newcastle Crown Court heard. 

CCTV filmed at the Northumberland prison shows Podd hurling the contraband on to a patch of grass near the laundry room.

Prisoners hid the four bottles inside the jail, but staff found them in a toilet cistern and a laundry box.

Now Podd has been jailed after pleading guilty to nine offences of conveying banned items into a prison.

Recorder Nigel Sangster QC told him: 'You were the stooge given the job to throw it over the wall but you took part in a serious offence.

'Those sent to prison are not meant to have drugs or mobile phones or alcohol in prison. The fact there is so much of it in prison is because people like you make sure people in prison get these things.'

The court heard Podd went to HMP Northumberland in a car driven by someone else last April.

They immediately aroused suspicion by turning up after visiting time had started.

Staff watched on CCTV as Podd eventually got out of the car and walked past the visitors' entrance and headed round the side of the prison towards the laundry block.

Emma Dowling, prosecuting, said: 'He was seen while walking across the car park to be using a mobile phone and had a carrier bag in the other hand. He is seen to skirt round some bushes and approach the perimeter fencing and throws four bottles over the fence.'

Staff monitoring the CCTV raised the alarm and all prisoners were stopped and searched.

One bottle was found hidden in a toilet cistern while the rest were found in a laundry box.

Miss Dowling said the doors to the laundry room had to be kept open so the prisoners didn't get too hot and they had prised open a piece of gauze in order to get outside and collect the illicit items.

Inside the bottles was 1.5 kilos of cannabis resin, worth up to £22,500 in prison, 168 subutex tablets, worth £16,000, 105 diazepam worth up to £1,000, 2.82g of cocaine, 2g of skunk cannabis, 48 temazepam, 55 steroids, seven mobile phones, miniature bottles of vodka and some syringes.

Podd, of Cairo Street, Sunderland, who has 123 previous convictions, including one from 10 years ago for possessing heroin with intent to supply, was jailed for three years. 

Nick Lane, defending, said: 'It's clear others were involved. His brother had a drug debt to satisfy and his brother was in custody. Threats were made and he was given the package and agreed to throw it over the wall.

'It's a large quantity of drugs but there is no evidence he could have benefited any further than the threats against his brother not being carried out.'
