With a billion people expected to tune in and watch Germany’s World Cup final against Argentina, it is understandable that Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli will want to look his best.

With less than six minutes on the clock, Rizzoli, who is an architect when he’s not taking charge of the biggest games in world football, spotted himself on the big screen at the Maracana and quickly sorted his quiff out during a break in play.

Rizzoli, who was chosen to officiate the final despite accusations he favoured Lionel Messi earlier in the tournament, was taking charge of his third Argentina match of the tournament, having refereed their wins against Belgium and Nigeria.

He was slammed by Belgium manager Marc Wilmots after Belgium’s 1-0 quarter-final defeat by Argentina.

Wilmots said: ‘I don’t want to be a cry baby, but I noticed the referee never gives fouls against Argentina. Every time something happens with Messi the referee gives him a free-kick.

‘I notice he (Messi) made three fouls and no yellow card, we made one foul and one yellow card.’

However Fifa’s head of referees, Massimo
 Busacca, said he had paid no attention to Wilmots’ claims and that 
Rizzoli’s ‘quality” was the reason for him being chosen to officiate the
 final.

‘I think the neutrality of the referees has been there in every game,’ Busacca told a news conference in Rio.

‘If we pay attention on every single complaint the coaches make we will not select any more referees. If you have the best quality, then you should be given the best matches.’

The 42-year-old Italian took charge of the 2013 Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund at Wembley, which the Bavarian giants won 2-1 thanks to a late winner from Arjen Robben.
