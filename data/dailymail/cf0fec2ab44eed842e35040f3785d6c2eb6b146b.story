Residents of an historic Kent market town fear a tourism backlash after allowing a thriller about a serial killer to be filmed there.

Channel 4 filmed their new four-part drama Southcliffe in the town of Faversham.

But when the local people gave their permission they believed it was a murder mystery not an account of a loner that embarks on a killing spree.

Residents of Faversham allowed film crews into their home, but claim they thought it was a murder mystery

The show is inspired by the Hungerford massacre in 1987 and the Whitehaven shootings, reported The Independent.

Southcliffe focusses on a loner ex-soldier who begins to kill after being persecuted by oppressive neighbours.

The Faversham Enterprise Partnership claimed that the show, which is produced by Warp Films, would generate £500,000 for the local economy.

David Simmons, Mayor of Faversham said: ‘The impression I got was that they were making a crime series like Midsomer Murders. We had no idea of the storyline.’

Residents opened their doors and allowed crews to film inside their homes for the show.

ITV’s Broadchurch encouraged a tourism boom in West Bay, Dorset, something that the town wanted to emulate.

Mayor Simmons added: ‘We hoped that the filming would be of economic benefit to the town. The crew stayed locally and people let them use their houses.’

The producres say that Southcliffe is not about the murderer, but the community and how they react to a tragic event

David Simmons, Mayor of Faversham said that he thought they were filming a murder mystery similar to Midsomer Murders

But, the creators of Southcliffe said that it is not the story of a killer, but how the town reacts to a tragic incident and the community spirit of the place.

Director Sean Durkin said: ‘It was about spending time in the area where we were shooting to see what it felt like to sit in a pub there, what it felt like to walk down the street. There was a palpable atmosphere.’

Bryan Mulhearn, councillor for Swale, said that he thinks there should be a screening in the town, with the chance for the producers to explain why they picked Faversham for the programme.
