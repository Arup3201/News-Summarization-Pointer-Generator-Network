Israeli diplomats were yesterday targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were blamed on Iran.

A bomb attached magnetically to a car in the Indian capital New Delhi exploded and injured the wife of an Israeli official and two bystanders.

Officials in Georgia said an explosive device was attached to the bottom of a diplomat’s car in the capital Tbilisi, but was found and defused before it detonated.

Fireball: The Bangkok blasts came the day after Israeli diplomats were targeted in simultaneous bomb plots which were also blamed on Iran. A bomb attached magnetically to a car in the Indian capital New Delhi exploded and injured the wife of an Israeli official and two bystanders

Rescue: Bystanders helped an injured person from the burning car after the bomb exploded infront of them

Closer examination: Indian security and forensic officials examine the car on Monday - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately blamed Iran for the attacks

Daylight explosion: The explosion took place in the late afternoon close to the embassy. An eyewitness told local media he had seen the car being followed by a young man on motorbike, who attached a device to the car before it exploded.

Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu 
said Iran was behind both incidents, adding that the Islamic republic’s 
Lebanese ally Hezbollah – which battled Israel in a month-long war in 
2006 – could have been involved too.

Iranian officials last night denied the claims as ‘sheer lies’.

If Iran were involved, the plots 
would represent a new threat of Israelis being targeted across the 
world. Tehran has been accused of developing a nuclear weapons programme
 and Israel says such a project would be a threat to the Jewish state.

Comments by Israeli officials have 
raised concerns that Israel might be preparing an imminent strike on 
Iranian nuclear facilities. The U.S. and other Western countries have 
been pressing Israel to give sanctions more time.

In New Delhi, Tal Yehoshua-Koren, the
 wife of an Israeli official, was in a car heading to pick up her 
children from school when a motorcyclist attached a magnetic bomb to the
 vehicle. Witnesses reported a person being flung from the car by the 
explosion that turned the vehicle into a fireball.

The woman and her driver, Manoj Sharma, survived and were taken to hospital.

The Israeli Defence Ministry said Mrs Yehoshua-Koren, was being treated at a local 
hospital by Israeli doctors.

The New Delhi attack took 
place just a few hundred metres from the prime minister's residence as 
the diplomat's wife was heading to the American Embassy School to pick 
up her children, said Delhi Police Commissioner B.K. Gupta.

Accusations: Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has accused Iran of being behind the attacks and said Israel has thwarted other attacks in recent months in Azerbaijan, Thailand and elsewhere

When
 the car approached a crossing, she noticed a motorcyclist ride up and 
stick something on it that appeared to be a magnetic device, he said.

The car drove a short distance, there was a loud sound and then an explosion and the car caught fire, he said.

'It
 was a loud explosion. We realized it's not a firecracker, but an 
explosion, and rushed toward the car,' said Ravi Singh, 50, owner of a 
gas station near the blast site.

'The blast was so powerful, the car behind got damaged as well,' said Monu, a nearby high school student who uses only one name.

Similar
 weapons were used against Iran's nuclear scientists, feeding suspicions
 that the new bombings were a retaliation crafted to mirror those 
attacks

At around the same time, in Tbilisi, a grenade was found attached to a car used by the Israeli ambassador, Yitzhak Gerberg.

Mr Netanyahu said: ‘Iran is behind these attacks and it is the largest terror exporter in the world.’

Shota Utiashvili, spokesman for the 
Georgian Interior Ministry, said the driver noticed a package attached 
to his car's undercarriage on Monday and called police.

Killed: Last month, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a director of Iran's main uranium enrichment died in a blast from a magnetic bomb placed on his car

Police found a grenade in the package and it was defused, Mr Utiashvili said.

He did not specify where the car was parked when the device was discovered.

In response Mr Netanyahu member of his party that Israel has thwarted other attacks in recent months in Azerbaijan, Thailand and elsewhere.

'In all those cases, the elements behind these attacks were Iran and its protege Hezbollah,' he said.

In what appeared to be a precautionary move, the Israeli ambassador to Egypt was held in the VIP lounge at Cairo's airport for four hours while police dogs sniffed two embassy cars waiting for him.

He later left for home under tight security, and the lounge was thoroughly searched by police.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

But copying the exact style of the murder of Roshan in Tehran appears a very deliberate statement in itself.

Hezbollah recently marked the anniversary of the 2008 assassination of one of its commanders, Imad Mughniyeh, in a bombing widely believed to have been carried out by Israel.

And Iran suspects Israeli involvement in a series of killings of officials and scientists aimed at halting their nuclear programme, which many fear is a thinly veiled ploy to build a nuclear bomb.

Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told cheering crowds gathered in Tehran that a significant development was soon to announced.

And Britain and the United States have moved warships into the Straits of Hormuz with a view to keeping the vital oil trade route open.
