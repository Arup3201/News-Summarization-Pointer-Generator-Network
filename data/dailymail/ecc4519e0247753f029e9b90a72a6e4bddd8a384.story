This is the birth certificate that reveals Hugh Grant has had a third love child, this time a son with a Swedish TV producer.

The 53-year-old actor's son was born in September 2012 to Anna Elisabet Eberstein, three months before Grant's lover, Tinglan Hong, gave birth to her second child by him, a son named Felix.

Grant's paternity was only publicly revealed when Miss Eberstein's baby's birth was re-registered, giving the father's name as Hugh John Mungo Grant, last month.

Apparently the original birth certificate had a blank where the father's name should go.

The birth certificate for the son Hugh Grant has had with Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein

Hugh Grant, 53, is said to have had a son with Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein 16 months ago

The son is the first child to be registered with Grant's surname. His other two children were registered with their mother's surname.

Ms Eberstein, who is said to have met Grant at a London party where she pitched an idea to him, is said to have moved into a £3million house near the actor's home shortly before she gave birth to the baby boy 16 months ago.

She was 'supported by Hugh all the way', it was reported, and is still believed to be living in the townhouse with her child.

Miss Eberstein is reportedly living with her son in a £3million house near Grant's home in West London

'Anna lives in a very comfortable property in West London and knows that Hugh is there for her,' a source told the Sun.

'Anna's parents in Sweden know all about the relationship and she has their blessing.'

However it is unclear whether the two women were aware they were both expecting the About A Boy star’s child around the same time.

Ms Eberstein, a former promotions producer for the ESPN sports channel, and Grant had an instant attraction for each other, it was reported today, and the pair went on several dates.

She is a keen tennis player and plays for the smart west London Queen's Club women's first team.

Her mother, Susanna Eberstein, is a well-known feminist campaigner in Sweden who campaigned to have a picture of a topless woman taken down from the country's parliament building.

Miss Hong,
 who was already the mother of Hugh’s daughter Tabitha, gave birth to Felix on 
December 29 2012 and registered the new arrival on Valentine’s Day 2013.

According to the birth certificate, Felix Chang was born at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London . 

At the time the actor tweeted: ‘In 
answer to some journos. Am thrilled my daughter now has a brother. Adore
 them both to an uncool degree. They have a fab mum.’

He added a short while later: ‘And to be crystal clear. I am the Daddy.’

Felix’s
 arrival came almost 17 months after Miss Hong gave birth to the 
couple’s first child, daughter Tabitha Xaio Xi Hong Grant, at London’s 
Portland Hospital, in September 2011.

In an interview with American chat 
show host Ellen DeGeneres, Grant admitted that while coming as something
 of a shock, fatherhood had had a very positive ‘life-changing’ effect 
on him.

He said: 
‘Everyone was right all these years, saying: “Hugh, why don’t you have 
some children? It changes your life.” Now that I have a child, it is 
life-changing. I recommend it. Get some.

‘I
 can’t pretend it wasn’t a little bit of a surprise. But it’s a very 
nice surprise. In fact, the baby’s name in Chinese, because the mother
 is Chinese, means ‘happy surprise’.

Miss Hong, who was born in Zhejiang 
province in eastern China and moved to Britain in 2003, is understood to
 have met Grant in a Chelsea wine bar in 2008.

The pair struck up an unlikely friendship before embarking on a relationship in January 2011.

Tabitha’s
 arrival was kept secret for two months until the actor’s spokesman 
released a statement confirming the birth, but adding that Grant – who 
rose to fame in Four Weddings And A Funeral in 1994 – was no longer in a
 relationship with Miss Hong.

It read: ‘I can confirm that Hugh 
Grant is the delighted father of a baby girl. He and the mother had a 
fleeting affair and while this was not planned, Hugh could not be 
happier or more supportive.’

Grant dated Elizabeth Hurley for 13 years and remains close
to the model  - he is the godfather to
her son Damien.

Following their amicable split he then started dating Jemima Khan for
three years. He is currently believed to
be single.

A spokesperson for Hugh Grant has been contacted for comment.

Hugh Grant previously dated divorced heiress Jemima Khan for three years,  from 2004 to 2007

Long term love: Hugh was with model/ actress Elizabeth Hurley for 13 years and they remain close

Hugh Grant now has three children by two different women.

Daughter Tabitha, 2, was born in 2011 after Grant started a relationship with Tinglan Hong.

He has since had two sons born within a few months of each other.

His first son, now aged 16 months, was born to Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Ebersetein on September 3, 2012.

Mother and son currently live in West London, near to Grant's home.

At the same time Ms Ebersetin was pregnant with her son, Grant got Miss Hong pregnant again.

She gave birth to baby Felix just a few months after Ms Ebersetein had her son, on December 29 2012.
