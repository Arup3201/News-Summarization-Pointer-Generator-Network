A father and son have appeared in a New York court accused of using their Medicaid-funded, not-for-profit drug-rehab operation to cream off $4 million through an alleged extortion and insurance fraud scheme.

Narco Freedom CEO Alan Brand, 64, and his son Jason, 35, are accused of using the cash to fund lavish lifestyles including several large houses and a fleet of luxury cars, according to charges filed on Wednesday.

The father and son were led into the Bronx Supreme Court in handcuffs by officers of state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, whose office had carried out the investigation.

According to the indictment, Alan Brand is being charged with insurance fraud, money laundering, bribery, and grand larceny. His son, Jason Brand, faces grand larceny and insurance fraud charges.

Both Brands have been charged with filing false documents to obtain a $3.5 million insurance payout for the restoration of a Narco office in Brooklyn, reports the New York Daily News. 

The remaining $600,000 came from kickbacks Alan Brand collected from the owners of the facility properties, the AG said. 

Schneiderman's office has frozen the pair's bank accounts and seized assets including two mansions on Long Island, and condos in Boynton Beach and Boca Raton, Florida.

Six luxury cars, including an electric yellow 1969 Corvette, an $80,000 Tesla and a 2002 Jaguar X have also been impounded. 

Both father and son have pleaded not guilty to the insurance fraud charges. They face up to 25 years in prison if convicted.

The pair are now under investigation for embezzlement of Medicaid funds.

'The people’s investigation has only just started,' Assistant AG Kristen Anne Conklin wrote in seeking bail for the Brands.

The father was freed on $225,000 bail and the son was freed on $178,000 bail on Wednesday.

As well as founding his luxury lifestyle, Alan Brand had donated to numerous political campaigns, including $10,000 into Gov. Cuomo’s re-election, $2,300 to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2008 presidential run, nearly $30,000 to Bronx pols.

He also gave $8,000 to Schneiderman' office, which will now be given to charity. An AG official, who explained that returning them any earlier would have tipped the Brands to the probe.

Narco Freedom operates methodone clinics and so-called ‘sober houses’ across the Bronx and receives about $38 million from Medicaid annually, plus has $6.3 million in state contracts.
