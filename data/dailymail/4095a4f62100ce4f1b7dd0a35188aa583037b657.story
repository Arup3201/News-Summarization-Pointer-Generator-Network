Actor Gerard Depardieu is paying tax of just six per cent in his adopted country of Russia after Vladimir Putin gave him a passport last year, it was revealed  earlier today.

He quit his native France over the punitive 75 percent wealth tax imposed by the socialist government. 

The 65-year-old actor filed his tax return on time in the remote region of Mordovia, better known for its prison camps, where he is registered as a self-employed businessman.

Actor Gerard Depardieu, pictured, left France for tax purposes after socialist President Francois Hollande imposed a 75 percent wealth tax on incomes above ¿1 million

This enables him to pay a reduced rate of six per cent compared with the standard Russian flat tax rate of 13 per cent, itself well below Western norms. 

The six-percent rate is for entrepreneurs with an annual income of less than 60 million roubles, roughly £1 million, said newspaper Izvestia yesterday.

Depardieu plans to set up a restaurant and arts centre in the dusty  regional capital of Saransk but he has not visited for a year. Mordovia is more than 2,000 miles from Paris and 300 miles further east than Moscow.

Local official Valery Maresyev said: 'There were plans and they haven't been dropped. Gerard Depardieu will return to them when he finishes other projects.'

The actor, who has become a friend of Putin's, has appeared in a Russian sitcom, an advertisement for a bank, and played Rasputin in a movie.

The French actor recently starred in a movie partly shot in Chechnya alongside Elizabeth Hurley, pictured

He has also made a film called 'Viktor' with Elizabeth Hurley, which was partly shot in Chechnya, ravaged by two wars since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In March he launched an new range of watches for Swiss  manufacturer Cvstos under the banner 'Proud to be Russian'.

Depardieu initially crossed the border to Belgium after France's President Hollande announced the decision to impose the wealth tax on annual incomes over €1 million.

Soon after arriving in the Belgian town of Nechin, the actor held a massive barbecue for local residents where he decribed himself as a 'citizen of the world'.

He later explained his reasons for moving to French magazine Le Figaro: 'I never left! I refuse to be shut in by borders, that's completely different.

'I am a free man. I feel at home everywhere in Europe.

'This whole story is a big misunderstanding. I love France as much as ever. It's my country.'
