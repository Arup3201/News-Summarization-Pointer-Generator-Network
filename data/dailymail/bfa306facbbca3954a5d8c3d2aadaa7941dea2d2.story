The mother of the the three Australian children who died aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 has told a packed Perth memorial service of the extreme pain she has experienced since their death.

Mo, Evie and Otis Maslin and their grandfather Nick Norris were returning from a holiday in Amsterdam, where their parents remained, when their plane was shot down over Ukraine.

'When their innocent bodies were blown from the sky, I stretched my arms as high as I could and screamed for them,' their mother, Rin Norris, told the crowd of 1,000 at Perth's Scotch College.

An emotional Rin Norris delivered a eulogy at the Perth service for her three children and father, Nick

'Now I see them only in my head. I can't touch them, I can't feel their warmth.

'I can imagine the memory of their bodies close to mine and the love in my heart will always be open for them. My arms will always be reaching for them.'

The mother of three, who was reduced to tears when remembering her children and father, was speaking publicly for the first time since her and husband Anthony released a statement about the 'hell beyond hell' they were living through following the crash.

'My three kids filled my world with a joy like a huge and ginormous balloon filled with lollies chuckles, sunshine and indescribable happiness.

'They taught me so much these wise little teachers, they taught me the names of the dockers players and the rules of AFL.'

'They taught me to speak Chinese and all the capital cities... how to climb trees, Ben and Jerry's ice cream flavours and that chips in milkshakes actually taste pretty good.'

The parents walked through a guard of honour at Paterson's Stadium formed by the children's friends, before letting go three large purple balloons in memory of their children

Fremantle Dockers players wore black armbands as a mark of respect for the three children, who were members of the AFL club

The heartfelt eulogy touched on the lives of each of the family members lost in the crash and she recognised each as an individual blessing in her life.

'For 41 years three months and two days I was lucky and proud to be the daughter of my old man,' Ms Norris said.

'Nicko, Grandad Nick, GN, and coined more recently by Otis... grandfather Nicholas.'

Anthony Maslin told service goers that his children had travelled to numerous countries around the world, cramming more into their short lives than most people do in their lifetimes.

He described his children, aged 12, 10 and 8, as 'unblemished, innocent, perfect souls'.

'It may give all of you some perspective to remember that the only thing worse for us than the hell beyond hell that we are going through now is the horrific thought that our family had never existed,' he said.

A short video message from the three children to a long-time friend they were meant to meet during the holiday was screened at a service

Mr Maslin said he found solace in the fact his three children died travelling with the 'wisest person' he knew, in grandfather Nick Norris.

'Someone said they were so close, they were meant to be together,' he said.

'And having Nick, the wisest man I know, as their eternal guide gives us some comfort, too.'

Family and friends of doctors Roger and Jill Guard packed out a theatre in Toowoomba, Queensland, on Sunday to celebrate their lives.

Roger had spent 25 years as the director of pathology at Toowoomba Base Hospital, providing evidence for many coronial inquests, while his wife of almost 42 years, Jill, was a GP

Their three adult children Paul, a coastal engineer, Amanda, a physiotherapist, and David, a pathologist like his dad, spoke of their love for their talented parents who explored the world with them.

'We're glad that you are together on your final adventure doing something you love,' eldest son Paul said.
