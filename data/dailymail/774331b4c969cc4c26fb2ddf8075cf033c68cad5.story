'Night from hell': Leanne Jakeman, 23, left, and Amy Hardy, 22 were shocked to discover the state of the Travelodge in Leicester

Two women who booked a hotelroom for their birthdays found their celebrations turned into a ‘night from hell’.

Leanne Jakeman, 23, and Amy Hardy, 22, checked in to a Travelodge in Leicester where they discovered ‘brown sludge’ coming out of the bathroom taps, soiled mattresses stored in the corridors and ripped carpets.

The pair were staying in a £59 twin-room in the central branch of the hotel chain for their annual ‘double-birthday night out’ when they made the grim discoveries.

Ms Jakeman attempted to run a bath 
ahead of getting ready for a night on the town but 45 minutes later the 
rub was filled with brown, gritty ‘sludge’.

As
the sales administrator headed down to reception to complain she passed
several safety violations as well as what appeared to be a disregard of
maintenance.

The 
corridor had several missing ceiling tiles exposing wiring in the roof 
after it appeared to have collapsed and a stack of stained and soiled 
mattresses has been placed against a wall.

A safety door had been propped open using a fire extinguisher as a door stopper.

In
addition, staff even tried to cover up the ripped carpet in the lobby 
by placing a ‘wet floor’ warning sign over the top of it.

‘It was horrible, it was like a hotel from hell,’ Ms Jakeman from Hunstanton, Norfolk said.

‘We have stayed there the two years before and it has always been fine so we didn’t expect it to be a problem.

‘We
checked in as normal and weren’t told of any problems but I ran a bath 
and came back to dirty, brown, sludgey water. It was disgusting.'

When staff arrived to attend to Ms Jakeman's complaint, they told her the boiler had not been working for a full day.

'They hadn’t mentioned a thing to us when we checked in,' Ms Jakeman added.

Complaints: The two girls observed fire extinguishers being used as door stops in the hotel and when Ms Jakeman drained the bathtub, an unexplained substance was left at the bottom

Nightmare: Ms Jakeman, pictured on a night out, made the dirty discoveries as she went down to the hotel reception to complain about their room

Disappointed: Mother-of-one Amy Hardy, left and sales administrator Leanne Jakeman, pictured on nights out, had a nightmare break at Travelodge in Leicester

Disgusted: Staff blamed a broken boiler for the girls' tub filling up with 'thick brown gritty sludge' when they tried to run a bath

Despite a promise that the boiler was 
going to be fixed within the hour, Ms Jakeman and Ms Hardy had to wash 
in cold water before their birthday celebrations.

‘By
the time we got in the next morning there was nothing coming from the 
hot tap at all and that was the same when we checked out.'

Ms Hardy, a mother-of-one from Boston,
Lincolnshire, added: ‘We even overheard them calling all the guests and
moving them because they said they couldn’t get someone out on the 
weekend to fix it.

‘It was so messy and looked like a building site. You could see the electric wires in the ceiling and there were panels missing.

'The carpet was torn in lots of places and they had tried to cover it up with a caution sign lying flat but it just looked a tip.'

Bad maintenance: Staff attempted to cover up the ripped carpet within the hotel with a 'wet floor' warning sign

Cleaning complaint: As Ms Jakeman left her hotel room to complain about their bath, she discovered soiled mattresses propped up against a wall in the corridor

Compensated: After Ms Hardy and Ms Jakeman complained, the hotel chain gave them a full refund

Ruined stay: The pair had booked a room at the Leicester Central branch of Travelodge

Ms Hardy added: ‘It could have been really dangerous but they didn’t seem to care because there were dirty mattresses left in the corridor.

‘It has definitely put me off staying there again. What should have been a good night out turned into a night from hell.’

The friends checked into the hotel on a Saturday night last month and have since been given a full refund and an offer of a free weekend stay at a Travelodge.

'We are very sorry to hear of Miss Jakeman’s recent experience at our Leicester Central hotel,' a spokesperson for the hotel chain told MailOnline in a statement.

'On the day in question, a temporary fault with the boiler resulted in a loss of hot water throughout the hotel, and caused water to leak in some places.

'Because this was a busy Saturday night, the hotel staff informed all customers that they could either remain in the hotel and receive a full refund, or be booked into other nearby hotels with all transport costs paid for.

'We recognise that there were a number of other issues identified by the customer, many which were caused by the fault with the boiler, however we have worked with our staff and are confident these have been resolved.'
