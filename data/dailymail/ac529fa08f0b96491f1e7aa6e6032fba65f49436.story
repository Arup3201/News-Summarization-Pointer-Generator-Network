A couple who spent five years living in a tent as they built themselves an eco-home have been allowed to keep it, despite not applying for planning permission because it was 'against their principles'.

Matthew Lepley, 34, and his partner Jules Smith, 54, left their home in a north London tower block and moved to the Devon countryside after buying a 20-acre field near Beaworthy.

Dreaming of 'living at one with nature', the couple spent five years sleeping in a tent and living off the land while they constructed a one-bedroom eco-cabin - complete with compost lavatory - from wooden crates, scrap metal and lorry tyres.

The Government planning official who decided to allow the couple's home to stand said he was impressed by their dedication to and passion for sustainable living

The couple, who shunned power tools and did all the work by hand to cut their carbon emissions, refused to apply for planning permission because they said the process wasted paper and used too much energy.

But their dream was left hanging in the balance when neighbours complained the tumbledown timber dwelling was unauthorised.

Mr Lepley and Ms Smith, both of whom were carers before they moved to Devon, were sent an enforcement notice from Torridge District Council ordering them to 'remove' it from their field in Beaworthy, Devon.

But, in a landmark ruling, planners have praised their 'passion' and 'commitment' to sustainable living, and told them the cabin can stay.

Despite previous cases of people shunning planning laws being prosecuted, the couple has now been granted permission to leave it untouched for at least three years.

Government planning inspector Gareth Symons said the couple's approach 'sits very comfortably' with new rules issued by the National Planning Policy Framework, which encourage builders to use natural materials to minimise waste and carbon emissions.

The house has an upstairs bedroom, outdoor compost lavatory, kitchen/diner and bathroom, as well as an underground food store because there is no fridge

Initially the couple were told by Torridge District Council that they would have to tear their home down, but they have now been granted a reprieve

Mr Symons described their efforts to live a frugal life at one with nature as 'admirable', and said forcing the pair to leave the handmade home could have a 'devastating impact' on them.

He said: 'It would be very difficult to flaw the passion the appellants have to achieve their permaculture aim, a key part of which is living with nature on the land.

'I am convinced about the genuineness and commitment of the appellants. They are not individuals who simply wish to have a house in the countryside.'

The pair run a smallholding on their land which, if it proves financially viable, may entitle them to retrospective planning permission when the three-year stay elapses.

Their utopian dream to escape the rat race began five years ago when they quit their jobs as carers and Wood Green tower block and moved to their newly-acquired 20-acre field.

They made foundations from old tractor tyres filled with gravel, while the walls and roof were built from discarded haulage pallets and railway sleepers.

But their 
refusal to use power tools meant that it took them five years to 
construct the small dwelling which boasts one bedroom, a bathroom with 
woodfire-heated bath, and an underground storage chamber.  It has no electricity, and food is kept underground to keep it cool.

The
 couple grow their own fruit and vegetables, have a compost heap for a 
toilet, and draw water out of the ground with a bore hole.

Neighbours
 were initially supportive of their ambition to live a self-sufficient 
lifestyle on the remote woodland plot, but when the couple revealed 
plans to turn their rustic retreat into a conservation business, hosting
 workshops in green engineering and 'permaculture', locals changed their
 tune and complained to the local authority.

Back to basics: The rustic bathroom in the Devon eco-home is supplied with water heated by a wood-fired tank

No en-suite here: The couple have an outdoors compost toilet which is accessible by a pathway made out of discarded wooden pallets

Build on-going: Mr Lefley and Ms Smith spent five years living in a tent while they constructed their eco-home without using power tools

The couple have won a three-year stay of execution at their remote, home-made home, which they have called Silent Haven

Mr Lepley said: 'We wanted to build a home that would let us truly live as one with nature.  This life is not for everyone but we love it - it enables us to live a therapeutic lifestyle and be self-sufficient.

'We took the decision to build without planning permission because the council's procedure is not environmentally friendly enough and it goes against our personal principles.'

A separate application for Mr Lepley to pay the council's costs was also dismissed.

Local residents are 'furious' at the decision to let the couple stay in the wooden house.

One local resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'If that was me, and I built any sort of addition to my house, the council would come down on me like a tonne of bricks. I had to get permission for my conservatory and it took me so long, but I did it.

'Now this couple get to come along and just build what they want, with the council unwilling to do anything. It's disgusting how some people are treated one way, and others another.'

Another said: 'It is all well and good them building this so called 'green home', but that doesn't mean they should be allowed to do it without permission.

'There are laws in place for a reason and for them to be completely ignored is unfair on everyone else who has stuck to them over the years.'
