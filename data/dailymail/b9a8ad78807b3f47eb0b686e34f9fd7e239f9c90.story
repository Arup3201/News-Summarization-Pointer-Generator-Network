Nine-year-old label Cushnie Et Ochs may have been creeping up the popularity stakes for some time now, but this week in New York, the designer name truly exploded.

Hotel heiress Ivanka Trump, Today host Savannah Guthrie, Gone Girl's Emily Ratajkowski and Australian actress Abbie Cornish have all worn figure-hugging cutout dresses by the New York-based designers in the last few days, as well as several high-profile models.

Established in 2008 by Londoner Carly Cushnie and New Yorker Michelle Ochs, both 28, Cushnie Et Ochs was first publicized when Michelle Obama wore one of their designs in 2011; after Bergdorf Goodman plucked them from obscurity and picked up their very first collection for Spring 2009.

Day earlier, Today host Savannah Guthrie, 43, wore a $550 figure-hugging crop top by the label to interview a host of celebrity guests at the SNL 40th anniversary show.

And for some celebrities last week, Cushnie Et Ochs - which specializes in form-fitting, architectural dresses that make use of clever cut-outs and sheer panels - proved a little too popular, when several models inadvertently turned up to events last week wearing identical  frocks.

Fall 2015: The designers' latest collection at New York Fashion Week was still full of body-con dresses, but also introduced some more fluid pieces, including a range of velvet pant suits

At last week's Sports Illustrated 2015 Swimsuit bash in Nashville, Tennessee, models Emily Ratajkowski and Sara Sampaio inadvertently sported an identical $1,495 tangerine Cushnie Et Ochs number.

The brunettes spent most of the night posing side-by-side, with Ms Ratajkowski later joking on Instagram: 'Yep were #twinning! Decided to rock it together and be each other's dates! (sic)'

The very next night in New York, Victoria's Secret models Lais Ribeiro and Heather Marks both arrived at the amfAR gala in matching Cushnie Et Ochs gowns, this time a $2,395 teal cut-out gown.

That same slinky floor-length frock was also worn by model and cookbook author Padma Lakshmi, 44, in New York last October.

So who are the designers behind the wildly successful label, and how did they climb to the top?  

Michelle graduated from New York's Parsons School of Design and interned for Marc Jacobs, while Carly studied at the same school and interned for Donna Karen, Proenza Schouler and Oscar De La Renta. 

Cushnie Et Ochs was first notably worn by Reese Witherspoon at a Los Angeles film gala in November 2011, but made its first real splash the following month.

After the First Lady Michelle Obama wore an elegant pine green dress by the designers to attend the 2011 Christmas in Washington event, fashion die-hards were drawn like moths to a flame.

Speaking to Three Bad Mice about their aesthetic around this time, Carly and Michelle cited 'the female body, strength and inner spirit' as their inspiration.

'The brand is for women by women, and we want to always express this female sensuality in our clothes,' they said.

'We often look to art and architecture to influence our sculptural shapes and lines.' 

Last year, Cushnie Et Ochs' statement gowns were worn by Kim Kardashian, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Selena Gomez and Lea Michelle, among others.  

At New York Fashion week in 2013, supermodel Karlie Kloss showcased an asymmetrical white dress on the Cushnie Et Ochs runway, and loved it so much she snapped it up and wore it to attend Betsey Johnson's show the following week.

Michelle and Carly unveiled their widely-praised Fall 2015 collection at New York Fashion Week on Friday.

The designer's latest line was still full of body-con dresses, but also introduced some more fluid pieces, including a range of velvet pant suits.

And another thing, much to the dismay of animal lovers everywhere: fur.

Asked by The Fashion Spot to name their favorite element of this season, Carly responded: 'Fur. Loads of it. I’ve got a giant fur scarf and my fur coat, I’m not ashamed.'

'Same,' echoed Michelle. 'I’ve got two coats and my fur wraparound.'

Let's hope this particular enthusiasm fizzles, and the women keep on with what they do best; sensual, show-stopping party frocks.
