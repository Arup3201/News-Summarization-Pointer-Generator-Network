A cat's grey and white fur was dyed pink after it got covered by dye when it walked through an industrial estate.

Casper the cat was left looking just like Bagpuss when he came home after his run-in with the dye at an estate near his owner's home in Eastwood, Essex.

His owner, Jayne Richardson, 40, said her pet looked just like the 1970s children's TV star when he came home shamefaced, and covered in dye, on Saturday.

Snap! Casper the cat looked like 1970s children's TV favourite, Bagpuss, right, after his run-in with red dye

Covered: Casper's owner managed to catch him before he trailed red ink through their home in Eastwood, Essex

Jayne Richardson washed Casper in her bath but then had to take him to the vet for a more professional clean

She followed a trail of red dye on bushes which led her to puddles of the 'gloopy liquid' on the nearby Progress Road industrial estate.

A scrub in the bath only removed some of the dye, so Casper was taken to the vet for a £50 power wash.

But a pink tinge still remains, leaving her pet, whom Mrs Richardson describes as 'a bit dumb', looking more like Bagpuss than ever.

Mrs Richardson, a shop assistant, said: 'He's an amazing sight - he looks just like Bagpuss.

'We were very upset about what happened - he ingested the ink, too, and it made his poo go read.

'We're very lucky that our house wasn't ruined - my husband managed to contain Casper before he got the ink all over our carpets and furnishings.

'I'm very worried about him in case he's been poisoned, but he's okay at the moment.'

She added: 'I don't believe in keeping animals indoors but I can't let him out now.  It's all very traumatic.'

Mrs Richardson says fly tipping is to blame, and says other cats and foxes have been seen locally with the ink on them.

Kitchen designer Lisa Goldsmith, 45, came home to find her black-furred cat, Pepsi, covered in a bright red liquid.

Pepsi spread the colour throughout her house and onto their eight month-old kitten Daisy.

Residents claim business owner Mohammed Hussain, who has a food factory on the industrial estate, is to blame for the liquid, but he denies he is at fault.

Mr Hussain said: 'There were building materials in our yard while we had work going on, but all that has gone now.

'Health and hygiene is a big priority for us as we are a food distribution business.'

A Southend Council spokesman said they always investigated reports of environmental hazards.

The children's TV show Bagpuss was created by Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate in 1974 but remains one of Britain's best loved programme to this day.

Only 13 episodes were ever made, which were broadcast from February 1974 to May that year, but they were repeated on television for the next 13 years.

In 1999, Bagpuss topped a BBC poll for the UK's favourite children's TV programme.

Each episode always started with Bagpuss asleep among lost toys displayed in a shop window owned by Emily, played by Firmin's daughter.

Only 13 episodes were ever made of the show, voted the children's favourite TV show ever in 1999

When Emily left the shop, Bagpuss - an 'old, saggy cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams' - woke up and would tell a story centered on one of the broken items in the shop window.

Various toys in the shop came to life, including Gabriel the toad, a rag doll called Madeleine and mice on the side of the 'mouse organ' (a small mechanical pipe organ that played rolls of music).

The toys discussed what the new object was and then the mice, singing in high-pitched squeaky harmony to the tune of Sumer Is Icumen In, mended the broken object.

The newly mended thing was then be put in the shop window, so that whoever had lost it would see it as they went past, and could come in and claim it.

Then Bagpuss would start yawning again, and the show would end as he fell asleep.

Bagpuss has now retired to the Rupert Bear Museum in Canterbury, part of the Museum of Canterbury, together with other characters from the show and Emily's shop window.

Most of the stories and songs used in the series are based on folk songs and fairy tales from around the world.

In 1987 the University of Kent at Canterbury awarded honorary degrees to Postgate and Firmin. In his speech, Postgate stated that the degree was really intended for Bagpuss, who was subsequently displayed in academic dress.

In 1999 the series came first in a BBC poll selecting the nation's favourite children's show. It also came fourth in the 2001 Channel 4 poll The 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows.
