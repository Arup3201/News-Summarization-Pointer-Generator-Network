A woman has won a six-year fight to have the name of the man she thought was her father removed from her birth certificate after he admitted in an argument she was conceived using donor sperm.

Paramedic Emma Cresswell, 26, and her two brothers had grown up in Northampton thinking that their mother's former partner Geoffrey Faint was their father.

However, during an argument with Mr Faint when the triplets were 19 he told them they had been conceived using donor sperm.

Ruling: Paramedic Emma Cresswell, 26, has become the first donor-conceived person in Britain to have the name of the man she thought was her father removed from her birth certificate

Now, after a six-year legal battle, Miss Cresswell has become
 the first donor-conceived person in Britain to have the name of her 'social father' removed from her birth certificate.

Miss Cresswell managed to persuade a district judge at Bristol County Court to allow her to have a new certificate with a blank space where Mr Faint's name was, and change her surname to that of her mother's maiden name.

The ruling could pave the way for the 70,000 people conceived using donor sperm or eggs to do the same, and has sparked debate over whether both a child's genetic and legal parentage should be included on birth certificates.

Miss Cresswell's mother Susan and Mr Faint had turned to artificial insemination using donated sperm after they struggled to conceive naturally.

Miss Cresswell and her brothers, Ben and Daniel, were born in April 1988, but soon afterwards the couple's relationship broke down, with the children raised by their mother.

Figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) for 2010 show in that year there were 547 babies born in the UK after donor insemination, from 513 births.

In August 1991 the register of fertility treatments, donors and recipients held by the HFEA was introduced, and children born after this date can be given non-identifying information about their donors after they turn 16. This information includes physical description, ethnicity, and how 
many children they had at the time of donation - although not every 
donor will have provided this information.

Prior to this date, records for parents' treatments would most likely have been destroyed, although they were unlikely to have contained details about the donor used.

People born before 1991 via donation, or those who donated, can sign up to The Donor Conceived Register to exchange information with, or contact one another.

On reaching 16, children born after April 2005 can find out information including the donor's name, date of birth and last known address, as well as medical history.

The first donor conceived person entitled to find out this information will turn 16 in 2022.

Anonymity
 was removed because it was  recognised by law that many donor-conceived
 people have a desire and a right to find out about where they came 
from.

Sperm donors should be between 18 and 41-years-old and must undergo screening tests before donating in order to reduce the risk of passing on hereditary diseases or conditions.

Payment of donors is prohibited, although donors can receive compensation of up to £35 per clinic vist to cover losses such as travel.

Donors who donate through a HFEA-licensed clinic are not the legal parent of any child born as a result of donation, have no legal obligation to that child, will not be named on the birth certificate, will have no rights over how the child will be brought up, and will not be asked to support the child financially.

When Miss Cresswell was a teenager she began to rebuild her relationship with Mr Faint, and moved in with him so she could be closer to college.

However, during an argument with Mr Faint after her first day at Coventry University, where she was studying paramedic science, she and her brothers learned the truth about how their parentage.

'In the middle of an argument, Geoff decided to tell one of my brothers and me that we were actually donor-conceived and that he wasn't our father,' she told The Sunday Telegraph, adding his confession had come as a shock.

She is now estranged from Mr Faint and began using her mother's maiden name soon after the argument.

'I had thought I was one person for so long and then I found out that a 
whole side of that wasn't true. So I changed my name to represent who I 
actually was,' she said.

Children born via donor sperm or eggs after 1991, the year in which the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority was set up, can be provided with non-identifying information about their sperm donor, while children born after 2005 can get identifying information once they turn 16.

However, unlike changes to adoption law allowing children to get information about their parentage, the 1991 and 2005 rulings were not applied retrospectively, meaning Miss Cresswell has been unable to find out the identity of her biological father.

She said that, unlike her brothers, she was uncomfortable at having to produce her birth certificate containing Mr Faint's name, as she did not feel any connection to him.

Miss Cresswell was assisted in her legal battle by assisted reproduction expert Dr Marilyn Crawshaw and research consultant Julia Feast, who works with the British Association for Adoption and Fostering.

Her mother and Mr Faint had to submit documents to the county court confirming they had used artificial insemination, before the judge agreed the change could be made in June last year.

Like Dr Crawshaw and Ms Feast, Miss Cresswell is a member of the Birth Registration campaign, and believes that birth certificates should show whether a baby was conceived naturally or not, as it would encourage parents to be more open as to their child's heritage.

She says that had her birth certificate contained such details, her mother and Mr Faint may have spokem to her about the donor earlier, and she might not have found out during an argument.

'If you tell them from the beginning, that can be a part of a stable family relationship,' she said.
