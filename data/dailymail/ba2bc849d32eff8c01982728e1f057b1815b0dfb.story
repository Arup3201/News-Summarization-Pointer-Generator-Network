The number of homeowners who are renting out a room to a lodger has doubled over the last year, a report reveals today.

The boom in renting out a room is ‘mainly being driven by the economic climate’ with people struggling to afford their mortgage as well as their rising household bills, a report claims.

More than 950,000 homeowners currently have a lodger, compared to just 477,000 last year, according to the report from the financial services firm LV.

It says Britain is turning into a nation of Rigsbys, the landlord played by the late actor Leonard Rossiter in the hit TV series Rising Damp.

Under a Government scheme, homeowners are allowed to rent out a room for up to £4,250 a year before paying a penny of tax on the extra income.

When asked why they have taken in a tenant, more than a third said they are renting out a room ‘to boost their squeezed income.’ 

Others said they are using the rent to pay their bills, such as council tax and heating bills, and others are using the extra money to pay down their mortgage or other debts.

Millions of workers have been hit by a pay freeze for the last two years, which means they have no extra money to cover the cost of their rising household bills.

To make matters worse, VAT has jumped to 20 per cent, child benefit has been frozen for three years and the cost of food is rising sharply and the cost of petrol or diesel is crippling.

By taking in a lodger, either temporarily or on a more full-time basis, they can boost their finances.

Matt Hutchinson, director of the flat and house share website SpareRoom.co.uk, has seen a 155 per cent increase in people offering rooms from Monday to Friday over the last year.

He said: ‘The booming lodger market is showing no signs of slowing.

‘The fact that lodger income is tax-free
up to £4,250 per year means renting out a room is one of the more 
appealing ways of generating some extra cash when times are hard.

The average age of a lodger is 29 although a minority - six per cent - are between the age of 45 and 54, according to LV’s report which polled more than 2,000 adults.

It comes at a time when high house prices mean millions of people cannot afford to buy their own home but also find that rents have reached record levels which they cannot afford.

With an average house price of around £160,000 but far higher in London and parts of the South, a person on the average salary of £26,000 has no chance of buying.

Latest figures, from the Council of 
Mortgage Lenders, show how the number of mortgages being handed out has 
collapsed from the much higher levels before the credit crunch.

In July, just 49,500 got a loan to buy a 
home. In July 2007 - the month before the credit crunch struck - the 
figure was nearly double this level at 96,500.

The fall in first-time buyers has been equally dramatic, plunging from 568,200 in 2001 to just 193,000 a decade later.

The English Housing Survey, published by the Department for Communities and Local Government, shows how the crisis is forcing growing numbers of young people to rent.

The number of households who are privately renting, such as parents with young children, has ballooned to its highest level since the 1970s.

There are 3.6million households who are privately renting from a landlord in 2010/11, the latest available figures, compared to just two million a decade ago.
