Putting off your regular run because it's too hot outside?

Well, a new technology might spell the end of your favourite summery excuse to dodge exercise.

The UK's first sweat-fuelled sportswear range designed to keep you cool has hit the British high street as temperatures push 30 degrees Celsius.

Californian sportswear company, Mountain Hardwear, has developed a range of clothing with elite athletes that it tested in the searing 40 degree heat of the Grand Canyon.

The 'Way2Cool' range of sportswear is made of the world's first fabric technology that uses wearers' sweat to activate in-built cooling agents.

The Cool.Q.Zero fabric has been developed to give runners and keep-fit junkies a winning edge in hot weather by preventing overheating.

The company claims that running tops with Cool.Q ZERO technology are the 'world's most advanced'.

It also said that the clothing range is the industry's 'first active-cooling technology designed to actually lower the overall temperature of the fabric when you sweat.'

The technology works due to hundreds of tiny rings embedded in the fabric and uses materials from industrial water filtration processes to ensure that excess moisture is 'sucked' away from the body.

The rings, which contain a cooling agent, react to sweat and moisture causing them to suck and swell to create an instant and prolonged cooling effect on the skin.

'Hot weather and heat are incredibly challenging conditions for anyone participating in outdoor activities, especially runners and aerobic athletes,' said Topher Gaylord, president of Mountain Hardwear. 

'Cool.Q ZERO changes that by enabling athletes to run more comfortably in hot conditions.

'It's a no-sweat solution for even the most extreme temperatures.'

The range comprises running tops, bandanas and sleeves, which are available from a variety of specialist shops in the UK.

Prices start at £20.
