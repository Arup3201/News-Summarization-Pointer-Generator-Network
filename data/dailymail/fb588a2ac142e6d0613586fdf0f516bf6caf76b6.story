The San Francisco Giants needed a superhero Tuesday to throw out the first pitch at their home opener. Lucky for them, Batkid was available.

Batkid is really Miles Scott, a 5-year old who has leukemia, though the disease is in remission. In November, who won over the hearts of San Francisco residents In November after he defeat the Riddler and helped save a damsel in distress.

Scott has always wanted to be Batman, and thanks to the Greater Bay Area Make-A-Wish Foundation, his dream came true.

At the time, President Obama even sent his first Vine through Twitter to congratulate Scott on his accomplishment.

Batkid arrived at At&T Park Tuesday afternoon for the Giants game against the Arizona Diamondbacks in style aboard the Batmobile. He even received a fist bump from outfielder Michael Morse.

After exiting the Batmobile, he was escorted to the mound by Giants pitcher Matt Cain where he was joined by Batman. Cain then returned to the batter's box to take the pitch. Batkid threw a nice fastball right to Cain, prompting a roar from the sellout crowd of more than 42,000.

And Batkid also apparently brings the Giants luck. They defeated the Diamondbacks 7-3.
