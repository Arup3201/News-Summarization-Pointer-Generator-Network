When applying for a job as a litter picker, a 'head for heights' is not usually required.

But for these abseiling cleaners collecting rubbish thrown down the cliff of a Chinese mountain, it's a necessity.

The 'spider men' abseil from the side of the 4,500ft cliff edge of Tianmen Mountain, risking their lives to pick up litter thrown away by visitors, according to The People's Daily Online .

Easy does it: The painstaking process is necessary because tourists chuck food packets, empty bottles and cans down the cliffside, defacing its natural beauty

Despite repeated calls by the Chinese Tourism Administration urging tourists not to throw their rubbish over the cliff edge, they continue to chuck empty food packets, bottles and cans into the mountain, as well as spitting and defacing the mountain.

The beauty spot, located in Zhangjiajie in central China's Hunan province, is popular with tourists looking to ride the cable car route, reportedly the longest in the world.

There is also a large temple on the summit, dating back to the Tang Dynasty which ruled the region for two periods between 610-690 and 705-907.

A similar cleaning operation is in place takes place on Mount Emei in Sichuan province, China, where cleaner Peng Wencai has spent 14 years descending down the mountain to collect trash thrown away by tourists.
