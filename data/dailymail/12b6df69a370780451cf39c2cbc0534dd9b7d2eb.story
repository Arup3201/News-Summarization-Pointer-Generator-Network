NHS chiefs are investigating after two babies died within weeks of each other at a struggling hospital.

The deaths of both stillborn infants have been classified as ‘serious incidents’ at the unit which has previously been criticised for its patient care and deteriorating finances.

Basildon and Thurrock was one of 11 NHS trusts placed in special measures in July 2013 amid concerns over its above average death rates.

It was then given a clean bill of health in June last year, following a ‘good’ rating from the Care Quality Commission. Its maternity unit was also the first in the country to receive an ‘outstanding’ grade.

However a regular assessment report has revealed that two babies died within weeks of each other in September, and the hospital has now launched a probe into the matter. 

One of the mothers was induced at Basildon Hospital in Essex despite staff not checking her full clinical details first. 

The woman was suffering from high blood pressure, or hypertension, which meant she was categorised as ‘high risk’ – though this has not been confirmed as the direct cause of the baby’s death.

The other death is ‘still unexplained’ pending a post-mortem examination. Families involved in the deaths have not been named. Staff have since been instructed to carry out blood pressure tests on women with hypertension as their labour progresses, as the report concluded that there had been ‘no room for complacency’ in the monitoring of the first mother or her baby.

Midwives have also been reminded to seek the opinion of medical staff on how to manage women where there is ‘any deviation from the normal’.

The review looked into 37 ‘serious incidents’ at the hospital in recent months – 19 of which had ‘moderate to catastrophic’ impact on patients. 

Stephen Metcalfe, MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, said he hoped there would not be a repeat of any mistakes.

He said: 'Every complex organisation faces a number of challenges but I have complete confidence in the team.

'The Care Quality Commission has said the trust is moving the right way. It does not mean they can be complacent but we need to work with and support them.

'If the hospital is now reporting more incidents it is because there is now a more open and transparent culture which is willing to accept and investigate mistakes and make sure they do not happen again.'

However Dan Chapple, of campaign group Cure The NHS, said promises of further investigation were ‘not good enough’. He said: ‘It is a shame to see the same problems with Basildon hospital recurring at a time when the CQC has deemed this hospital safe enough to be brought out of special measures.

‘The hospital’s normal comment with these sorts of incidents is that they will learn from them but when similar incidents recur year after year it just is not good enough.’

A review last year found deaths among weekend admissions contributed to the hospital's death rate being 11 per cent higher than the average NHS hospital.

In the two years to October 2012, there were 544 more deaths than expected.

The trust was removed from special measures last June after the quality of services improved.

But it emerged last month that health service watchdog Monitor had launched an fresh investigation into the finances of the hospital. Monitor is concerned about a predicted deficit of £14.2m because it is larger than previously expected.

Monitor was told about the loss when a revised deficit plan was submitted in November and will now seek to find out why finances have deteriorated and what can be done to fix them.

A Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'It is unclear at this stage whether any of the patients died as a direct result of the serious incident as they are still being investigated.

'Basildon Hospital is committed to providing all its patients with safe, high-quality treatment and care. Crucial to that is learning when things go wrong.'
