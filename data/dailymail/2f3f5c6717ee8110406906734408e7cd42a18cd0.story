German football star Sami Khedira's stunning girlfriend has been shown a yellow card - for being too sexy.

Lena Gercke, 24, has been asked by the German FA to tone down her appearance when taking her place in the stand for tomorrow's Euro 2012 semi-final clash against Italy.

German gossip magazine Bunte reports that national sports chiefs fear the model has overshadowed the other wives and girlfriends during the tournament.

Controversial: Lena Gercke shot to even more fame after she appeared on the cover of German GQ alongside her boyfriend Sami Khedira

This had led to bickering between rival WAGS and subsequently lowered morale within the team camp, it said.

And so she has been requested 'not to hog the spotlight' before tomorrow's crucial match, so the focus can be switched back to the beautiful game.

The winner of the Germany's first Next Top Model contest started dating the Real Madrid ace last year. She was snapped wearing a pair of skimpy shorts at the start of the tournament.

She appeared semi-naked on the German version of GQ magazine alongside her fully-clothed midfield lover, 25, last year.

Future: The couple are set to tie the knot soon after the championships are over

The couple are set to tie the knot after the championships are over. Khedira is one of ten Real Madrid players to pull on a national shirt in a bid to win a place in the final.

Cristiano Ronaldo will lead Portugal's Pepe and Fabio Coentrao out against their team mates representing Spain in Donetsk tonight.

Spain will contain Iker Casillas, Alvaro Arbeloa, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos, while Khedira will line up against Italy alongside Mesut Ozil in Warsaw on Thursday.

Khedira is one of a vast majority of the players in Joachim Loew's 23-man squad that are products of a youth system launched on the back of disappointing tournament results in 1998 and 2000.

He was part of the 2009 Under-21 European championship-winning team.

That team's triumph completed a rare set of titles as Germany were also European champions in the Under-19 and Under-17 age groups, won a year earlier.
