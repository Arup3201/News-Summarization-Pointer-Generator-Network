Guilty: Faisal Madani used a fake credit card in the name of Wonderbra supermodel Eva Herzigova, pictured, and is now facing jail after confessing to a £300,000 scam

A convicted fraudster who used a fake credit card in the name of Wonderbra supermodel Eva Herzigova is facing jail after confessing to a £300,000 scam.

Faisal Madani, 47, described as a fixer for celebrities and top footballers, admitted using the bogus card in the Czech beauty’s name at Southwark Crown Court today.

Dubai-born businessman Madani pleaded guilty today to 17 counts of fraud and a string of other offences between November 2007 and October 2009.

Prosecutor Helen Malcolm QC said: ‘The total loss in this case is in the region of £300,000.’

The court heard that Madani’s offending began in late 2007 when he was caught claiming he had ‘lawful authority’ to use an American Express car in the name of E Snick.

Over the following years he was caught pulling the same scam 16 times, including in January 2008, when he used an HSBC visa card in the name of Ms Herzigova.

Madani confessed to using a fake Tunisian passport and immigration documents in the name of Jemai Fathi, and of attempting to use a false Greek passport to set up a bank account for himself.

He also admitted being caught, on two separate occasions between February 2008 and October 2009, with pieces of paper containing the details of 36 people, including K Y Hang, Thomas Obermans, Jun Igichi, A Attenborough, and Andrew Wigram.

Madani pleaded guilty to acquiring £121,210.28 of criminal property between May and October 2009 and to stealing £1,223 for Ross Grist Taylor on January 8, 2008, the same day he used the card in Ms Herzigova’s name.

Lawyers for Madani asked for the court to grant time to obtain medical reports stating that he had suffered three heart attacks, including one while appearing in court in Colchester, and that he was currently waiting for heart surgery.

He was also heard to have a ‘massive diabetic issue’.

Remanding the businessman on bail 
Judge Alistair McCreath said: ‘I’m saying nothing about what sentence 
you will get in putting the case over so your lawyers can get medical 
reports.

‘You know perfectly well that you are in serious trouble and you know perfectly well what sort of sentence you are looking at.’

Madani was jailed in April 2008 at Chester Crown Court for fraud.

He and then business partner Graeme 
Walker were convicted of forging and selling autographs of famous 
sportsmen including Sir Alex Ferguson, Cristiano Ronaldo, Roy Keane, 
Steven Gerrard, and Jonny Wilkinson.

Madani, from Colchester, Essex, today 
pleaded guilty to 17 counts of fraud, three counts of possession of 
false identity documents with intent, two counts of possession of 
articles for use in fraud, one count of acquiring criminal property, and
one count of theft.

He is due to be sentenced on May 17.
