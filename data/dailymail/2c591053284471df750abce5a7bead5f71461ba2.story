Most people would find working on Christmas day a depressing affair but Liverpool's players appeared in high spirits as they trained at Melwood.

Steven Gerrard, Kolo Toure, Mario Balotelli and their team-mates were seen laughing and joking around ahead of their Boxing Day clash with Burnley. 

Brendan Rodgers will be hoping his side can get back to winning ways after picking up just two points from their last three Premier League games.

Liverpool's manager has faced heavy criticism in recent weeks for his side's poor run of form, but he has found support in the form of former colleague Sean Dyche.

The Burnley boss said: 'He's got his question marks now but in the grand scheme of things he's a good coach.

'I think overall Brendan's done very, very well, it's just that the demands from last season, going so high, are seemingly making what's happening now look nowhere near as good as before.

'He's a good guy, I like him a lot and respect him.

'We have to have people doing well who are English or British, fuelling the belief at the top level, from boards and fans even, that there are good English, British coaches out there doing good work.'
