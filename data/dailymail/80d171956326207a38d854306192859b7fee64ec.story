Radamel Falcao's second-half penalty was not enough to secure Monaco victory in their first Ligue 1 game of the season, as the principality side lost 2-1 to Lorient on Sunday evening.

The Colombia international, who missed the World Cup through injury, continued his comeback from knee surgery by playing the final 30 minutes at Stade Louis II, but his side lost to an 87th minute winner from Lorient substitute Valentin Lavigne.

Former Chelsea and Real Madrid defender Ricardo Carvalho saw red for Monaco in the second half, leaving Leonardo Jardim’s new side short for the final 20 minutes.

On the move? Falcao has been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid despite Monaco wanting him to stay

Early lead: Vincent Aboubakar put the visitors in front with a penalty in the ninth minute at Stade Louis II

Drawing level: Falcao came on as a second-half substitute and scored a penalty to make it 1-1

Team-mates: Dimitar Berbatov high-fives Falcao, but Monaco soon went behind again to Lavigne's late strike

Falcao has been heavily linked with a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid, despite only joining Monaco last summer from Real's cross-city rivals Atletico. 

The French side have insisted they are unwilling to sell the Colombian star, particularly after Falcao's international team-mate James Rodriguez left the club to join Real Madrid earlier in the summer.

Vincent Aboubakar initially put Lorient ahead in the ninth minute with a penalty, but Monaco striker Radamel Falcao also converted a spot kick to level in the 78th, after being brought on for Lucas Ocampos with half an hour remaining. 

Monaco were down to 10 men in the 68th when Carvalho picked up a second yellow card for fouling Lorient substitute Walid Mesloub. 

Another of the visiting side's substitutes Lavigne then scored the winner with a low strike in the 87th minute of the game.

Elsewhere in Ligue 1, Lyon beat Rennes 2-0.
