A six-year-old boy was stabbed to death in a frenzied attack moments after his father plunged a knife into his mother.

Joseph Chadwick was asleep in bed at the family's Bolton-le-Sands home when he woke to hear his mother Lisa Clay screaming for help.

As he stood at the door to his parent's bedroom, his father Paul Chadwick, launched a horrific attack on his son.

Victims: Lisa Clay holding her young son Joseph. The pair were killed when Paul Chadwick went on a rampage, launching a frenzied attack on his partner and six-year-old son

The 34-year-old turned on Joseph as his partner, 40, tried to escape across the landing.

Chadwick repeatedly stabbed the six-year-old before plunging the blade into his partner again as she tried to get help, before returning to kill his son.

He then stabbed himself in a botched suicide attempt.

The horrific scene confronted Mr Chadwick's mother as she peered through the letter box in a bid to reach her family when Joseph failed to arrive at day care.

She was faced with Miss Clay's body lying in the hallway and Chadwick, lying with life-threatening wounds, on the floor at the foot of the stairs.

When police officers broke into the house they discovered Joseph lying on a bed upstairs with his arms crossed.

Tests revealed the youngster had been stabbed 25 times. One wound in his neck measured 3.5ins, while he suffered six puncture wounds to his chest.

His mother's body suffered 32 separate knife wounds to her neck, chest and legs - 18 were to her hands and arms.

Multiple wounds: Tests revealed Miss Clay suffered 32 stab wounds to her neck, chest, legs, hands and arms. Her son Joseph suffered 25 puncture wounds to his tiny body

When he was interviewed by detectives Chadwick claimed he wanted the three of them to be 'together in death'.

He said, ‘I feel awful, terrible, I wish I could turn the clock back. I have done wrong, I love my boy and my girl.

'I didn’t mean to. I killed them but I don’t know why I did it.'

Preston Crown Court heard the tragedy occurred on the day self-employed landscape gardener Chadwick was due to see a psychiatrist for the first time about his deteriorating mental health.

He and his family had moved to a semi-detached house using money left from Miss Clay’s mother and appeared to be 'normal happy family' with no financial problems. She worked part time at a Marks and Spencers store.

But despite having 'the perfect family' Chadwick had begun talking of 'voices in his head' in the weeks before the double killing.

He claimed clients weren’t talking to him and people were saying they thought he was gay.

His mother was so worried about his behaviour she urged him to seek help and he was referred to a psychiatrist by his GP.

But on April 9 - the day of the hospital appointment - Chadwick got out of bed at 5am to get a glass of water.

He picked up two kitchen knives and hid them under his marital bed as Miss Clay lay asleep.

Prosecuting Mr Stuart Denney QC said: 'He said he picked up a pillow and put it over his sleeping partner in an attempt to suffocate her.

'He then stabbed her a number of times but she managed to get out of the bedroom and across the landing and down the stairs.

'Meanwhile Joseph came to the bedroom door and he said he grabbed hold of Joseph and stabbed him two or three times before pursuing Miss Clay and stabbing her several more times.

'She fell and tried to get up to the front door but the defendant pulled her back.'

Secure unit: Chadwick, 34, is being held at Guild Lodge mental health facility. On the day of the double killing he was due to see a psychiatrist about his deteriorating mental health problems

Chadwick stabbed his partner repeatedly and returned upstairs where he found Joseph still slightly breathing and stabbed him again.

Afterwards he placed Joseph on his bed with his arms crossed over his body before slashing his neck and upper body up to five times and falling down the stairs.

Chadwick’s mother, Susan made the discovery after she tried and failed to contact the family when Joseph was not dropped off for child care.

Blood was said to be in the kitchen, lounge, hallway and both bedrooms and one knife was found under the double bed and another blood stained knife found near to the door of the double bedroom.

Chadwick was airlifted to Royal Preston Hospital and placed under 24-hour guard and was charged with murder 12 days later.

His guilty plea to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted.

When interviewed by police he said he had been referred by his by his GP for a psychiatric appointment but didn’t want to go.

He said that he had been, 'upset for a few days' and 'broody about being tormented by his uncle on his 18th birthday about being gay'.

After the double killing, he was diagnosed with suffering from a psychotic medical condition that caused him to have abnormal mental functioning, with one doctor diagnosing him as being paranoid schizophrenic.

In mitigation Miss Suzanne Goddard QC said: 'The facts of this very tragic case speak for themselves. He killed the two people he loved the most.

'He is full of remorse for what he has done. He wishes to apologise to his family, Miss Clay’s family and is struggling to come to terms with it. It is something that will be with him for the rest of his life.'

Ordering him to be detained a secure mental health unit, the judge Mr Justice Timothy King told Chadwick: 'In any view this is a tragic case and there is no order of this court that can restore the lives of Lisa and Joseph.

'I’m very conscious of the impact which this has had on the families concerned in this case.'
