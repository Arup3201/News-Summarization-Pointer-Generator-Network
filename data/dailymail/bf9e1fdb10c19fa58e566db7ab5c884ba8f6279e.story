Galloping happily in a field, this  magnificent Clydesdale horse makes the most of some spring sunshine.

But it will be back to work tomorrow when it joins around 50 others taking part in the annual heavy horse festival.

The event at Milfield, Northumberland, just over the Border from  Coldstream, Berwickshire, proved an enormous attraction last year.

The organisers hope this year’s event will once again draw large crowds from all over the country.

The festival organised by the  Cockburn family will feature many equine roles including carriage  driving and riding. It will also provide the public with the chance to marvel at many skills such as saddlery.

On display will be an assortment of vintage farming machinery, much of which is still in working order.

But for most, the main attraction will be the Clydesdales, a breed of draught horses derived from the farms of the area after which they are named.
