Some people think Liverpool are mad to bring Mario Balotelli to Anfield, but he is the kind of signing that gets fans buzzing with excitement. He is a unique character but he can galvanise the club and has the potential to be a real success at Liverpool.

Intelligence: Mario Balotelli boasts clever movement and a cool head in front of goal

Footballing intelligence

England needed to look after him at the World Cup but they failed because of his clever movement. He looks to pull off the shoulder and get in behind defenders, and he did just that when he drifted off the back of Gary Cahill to head in for Italy at the far post.

Striking mentality

We all know about his problems off the field but he can’t let them affect his game on it. If he keeps his focus he is deadly. He is cool in front of goal — he has scored 17 out of 19 penalties for club and country — but he is susceptible to being wound up. In Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool have the perfect coach to get the best out of him. Sometimes it doesn’t matter if your team-mate is wearing crazy clothes or setting off fireworks in his bathroom — as long as he does the business on the pitch you put up with it.

Deadly technique

Often Balotelli relies on raw power to beat his man but he still has excellent technique. He is strong in the air and good with both feet, particularly his right. If he can get in behind defenders in that right-hand channel then more often than not the ball will end up in the back of the net

Time for some team-work 

Balotelli is not an out-and-out striker, but he never wants to wander too far from that central area where he can score. He may have to adapt at Liverpool. Luis Suarez was forever popping up all over the pitch and, though Balotelli is not a direct replacement, he has to be prepared to rotate.

Pure power

 

England failed to get a grip on Balotelli and a large part of that was because of his raw power. He is so strong and, combined with his pace, it makes him a fearsome striker.

How I'd mark him

When a player has so much pace and power, you have to show him your own strength. I might be a bit ‘clumsy’ around him to see how he reacts, because he can be wound up. It’s not clever to get too tight when marking him unless you’re favourite to win the ball.
