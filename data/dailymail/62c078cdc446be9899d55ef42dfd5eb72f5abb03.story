Double Grand National-winning jockey Carl Llewellyn is set to face disciplinary action by the British Horseracing Authority for making a racist comment on the eve of the Cheltenham Festival.

Llewellyn, now assistant trainer to Nigel Twiston-Davies, can expect to be charged today for conduct prejudicial to the reputation of horseracing.

This follows his observation that ‘there are no n****** in here’ while sitting on a preview panel at the Hollow Bottom pub near Cheltenham in front of 140 racing fans.

Disciplinary action: Carl Llewellyn made a racist comment on the eve of the Cheltenham festival

Happy times: Llewellyn winning the Grand National at Aintree on Earth Summit back in 1998

The upcoming charge comes after a thorough investigation by the BHA, who waited until Gloucester Police, who questioned Llewellyn under caution, had completed their inquiries. They are taking no action because no official complaint was made.

Racing can be an insular sport but the BHA were galvanised into action by Cheltenham guest Helen Grant, the Minister for Sport.

She was ‘appalled and shocked by the use of this horrific racist word’, calling Llewellyn’s  language ‘absolutely indefensible’.

Llewellyn is likely to face a BHA disciplinary panel the week after next Saturday’s Grand National, with the punishment for the offence ranging from a fine to a ban from the sport.

Indefensible: Minister of Sport and Equalities Helen Grant slammed the former jockey

Premier League referee Andre Marriner, fortunate to be officiating on Saturday after wrongly sending off Arsenal’s Kieran Gibbs, has also escaped censure for breaching rules banning officials from talking to the media about match incidents.

Marriner revealed he had been ‘knocked for six’ after dismissing Gibbs rather than Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and had ‘analysed it to death’.

But the Professional Game Match Officials Board will take no action against Marriner because he didn’t realise a journalist was present at a talk to young players about refereeing at an event backed by the PFA.

Sir Alex Ferguson’s presence at most Manchester United matches must be hard enough for his beleaguered successor David Moyes

But at least Sir Alex has stopped going to the training ground, where he liked to use United’s state-of-the-art gym. And unlike other directors Sir Bobby Charlton, David Gill and Mike Edelson, Fergie keeps out of the dressing room after games.

The wheels of justice move painfully slowly at Wembley, with still no FA decision on whether Tranmere boss Ronnie Moore will face a charge six weeks after being suspended by his club.

This follows Sports Agenda’s revelation that Moore was under investigation for allegedly breaching betting regulations by gambling on competitions involving Tranmere.

Nike put shirt on Wayne

England talisman Wayne Rooney, who has a central role in Nike’s World Cup TV commercial, is also likely to be centre stage when the US firm launch two new England shirts next week.

Nike are expected to use social media for their campaign, drip-feeding information about the kit at the start of the week leading up to a grand unveiling on Wednesday.

However slick the Nike promotion, there will be understandable outrage that England fans are being milked for four different shirts in just over a year. Nike promise a normal production cycle after the World Cup with the home shirt staying the same for two years.

Lucky: Andre Marriner, guilty of wrongly sending off Kieran Gibbs last week, has been cleared if punishment after some of his quotes reported by media

Boost? Relief for David Moyes, as at least Sir Alex Ferguson has stopped using Manhester United's gym facilities

Main man: Wayne Rooney will be the star of Nike's advertising campaign for the World Cup

The FA Council are certain to turn down Hull City owner Assem Allam’s bid to change the name of his team to Hull Tigers at their summit on April 9.

So it will make for an interesting lunch at Wembley three days later when Allam, who has said he will walk away from the club if he doesn’t get his way, is due to dine with the blazers before Hull’s  FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield United.

To Cleverley, Manchester United’s struggling midfielder, is reported to be staying with agent Simon Kennedy, whose KMA agency went into administration following the breakdown in relationship between Kennedy and co-founder Ian Mckeand.

Kennedy has reformed his agency as Pinnacle Sport and Entertainment, with Tom and his father, Andrew, on board.

No dice: The FA are certain to turn down Assem Allam's claim to have Hull City's name changed
