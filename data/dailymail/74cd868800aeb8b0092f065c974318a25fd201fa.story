Elvin Payamps of Queens allegedly told a friend that he wished the two cops assassinated in Brooklyn on Saturday had been white

A New York man has been arrested and charged after he was overheard talking on his cell phone about wanting to murder two white NYPD officers.

Elvin Payamps of Queens allegedly told a friend that he wished the two cops assassinated in Brooklyn on Saturday - Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu - had been white.

Payamps was heard vowing to make it right by shooting more officers, as he stood in a TD Bank branch on Wednesday lunchtime.

Unbeknownst to Payamps, 38, his threats were overheard ex-NYPD officer Charles Otero who was stood nearby, reports the New York Post.

'I'm going to kill another cop. We should do it before Christmas. The cop should have been white that was killed. I always have a gun on me,' he is alleged to have said. 

Otero called 911, and Payamps was later stopped by the police. He was found to have marijuana on his person and was taken into custody.

Police then searched his home, which was less than a mile from the Christ Tabernacle Church where  Rafael Ramos' funeral will be held on Saturday.

At Payamps's house, officers found a Jimenez Arms 9mm pistol and a Mossberg Maverick 12-gauge shotgun with defaced serial numbers, as well as two bulletproof vests and brass knuckles.

Payamps allegedly confessed to stealing one of the vests from the Brooklyn Detention Center and to making the threat against officers.

He was ordered held in lieu of $500,000 bail on Thursday night on felony weapons charges, along with charges of felony aggravated harassment, unlawful use of a police uniform and pot possession.

'The case is serious,' said Queens Criminal Court Judge Stephanie Zaro. 'But the law does not allow me to remand on a C violent felony,' she said, in reference to the weapons charge.

NYPD officers found a Jimenez Arms 9-mm firearm and a Mossberg Maverick 12-gauge shotgun with defaced serial numbers, as well as two bulletproof vests and brass knuckles at Payamps' Queens home
