Dejan Lovren has described his move to Liverpool as a 'dream come true' after his £20million switch from Southampton was confirmed.

The Croatia international has created Anfield history, as he becomes the most expensive defender in the club's history, surpassing the previous £18.6million that Liverpool paid Paris St Germain for Mamadou Sakho last September.

Lovren, who has been Brendan Rodgers No 1 target for central defence all summer, agreed terms on a five-year contract after he completed a medical on Merseyside.

Lovren,
 who joins former Southampton colleagues Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana
 at Anfield, told liverpoolfc.com: 'It's a dream come true. I'm happy 
and glad to be here. I'm proud and can't wait to start. I know we have 
millions and millions of supporters - Liverpool is more than a club.

'After
 I played at Anfield last season, I said to myself: "One day I hope I'll
 be able to play here for Liverpool". The fans will know from the first 
minute that I'm a player that will give 100 per cent on the pitch.'

Red alert! The Croatia defender represented his nation in Brazil during the 2014 World Cup

Moving on: Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana are two of the players to have left Southampton so far

He
 added: 'I played there last season in front of the crowd singing 
"You'll Never Walk Alone". That is something very special for every 
player, every sportsman and every fan. I can't wait to get started.

'I'm
 a player that will give 100 per cent and I want to show that to the 
supporters because they deserve to see players who give 100 per cent. I 
know it is going to be something special to play in front of the fans at
 Anfield and I can't wait.'

Lovren
 also paid tribute to Brendan Rodgers after the manager guided Liverpool
 to second place in the Premier League last season.

'We
 have spoken a little bit,' Lovren said. 'Liverpool have already bought 
five players, so you can see the club has big ambitions to carry on and 
not stop here. Of course, I want to be part of the club's ambitions.

'I
 like his style, it's amazing and quite similar to Southampton. Their 
games last year were great, particularly the win at St Mary's. Liverpool
 play amazing football so I can't wait to join up with the team. It is a
 privilege to be here.'
