John Bercow was urged to sack his chief spin doctor tonight after she launched an astonishing political attack on the Conservatives, Labour and Ukip.

Justine McGuinness, who is in charge of media relations for the Commons Speaker, described the three parties as a ‘collection of clowns’.

In an extraordinary rant at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow, she accused the Conservatives of trying to ‘buy the election’, and blasted Ukip’s ‘utterly perverted notion of patriotism’.

Commons Speaker John Bercow is supposed to be politically neutral, but his spokesman Justine McGuinness today used a speech to the Lib Dem party conference to launch an attack on other rival parties

She also attacked Labour for trying to ‘steal the election’ by supporting a ‘biased’ electoral system.

Miss McGuinness, a longtime Lib Dem activist, was speaking in a personal capacity. But her comments appeared to breach the longstanding convention that the Speaker’s office must remain neutral on party political matters.

Tory MP Michael Fabricant  said the tirade called into question Mr Bercow’s judgment in hiring Miss McGuinness – and called on him to sack her.

He said: ‘The Speaker has to be politically neutral and has to be seen to be so. How then can he employ someone as his official spokesman who has nailed her colours to the mast in a political rant against the Conservatives and Labour?

‘This calls into question yet again the judgment of John Bercow. If she is still employed by him this evening after this then she should no longer be so. It is essential for the integrity of Parliament that the neutrality of the Speaker’s office is maintained.

Tory MP Michael Fabricant said Mr Bercow could not employ someone who was so overtly political

‘We also need to hear from Mr Bercow whether he was aware that his spokesman was going to make such an overtly political spokesman. Tirades of this nature are simply not acceptable – either from the Speaker or his spokesman.’

Miss McGuinness, a former media adviser to Kate and Gerry McCann, did not respond to calls  and it is now known whether she cleared her comments in advance with Mr Bercow.

She has been involved in Lib Dem politics for years and has previously stood for Parliament against Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin. She is employed by the Commons on a freelance basis for an undisclosed sum, and is not a civil servant.

But the highly political nature of her comments is likely to raise concerns at Westminster.

Addressing activists from the main podium, she said: ‘The next general election campaign will be a really ugly business.

‘The Tories will aim to buy the election with the millions of pounds donated to them by their hot money, hedge fund friends.

‘Labour will seek to steal the election, relying on an electoral system so biased in their favour that 35 per cent of the vote could deliver them 55 per cent of the seats.

‘Ukip will try and hijack the election, turning the whole event into an argument about Europe and immigration as Nigel Farage swans around suburbia selling himself as some sort of suburban, saloon bar Socrates.

‘And the one thing that will connect this collection of clowns will be a desperate determination to marginalise the Liberal Democrats, for what they all fear above all else is that once again the British people will put the balance of power into our hands.

‘The Lib Dems will offer this country a fair deal. Labour have their warped sense of the term equality, the Tories are welcome to their twisted notion of freedom, and Ukip are welcome to their utterly perverted notion of patriotism. Fairness is what we will stand for.’

The row is an unwelcome development for Mr Bercow, who is already embroiled in controversy over his bid to appoint Australian Carol Mills as the new Commons Clerk despite widespread concerns she is not qualified for the job.
