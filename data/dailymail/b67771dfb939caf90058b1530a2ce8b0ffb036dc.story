Until now, Natalie Pearson has been her little girl Sienna's voice.

The six-year-old was born with a rare genetic condition which means she cannot speak and will struggle with her health throughout her life.

But while her school friends, in St Athan, near Cardiff, have present wish lists reams long, the little girl has only one Christmas gift on hers - to be able to speak to her 'mummy'.

Natalie Pearce from St Athan in South Wales is trying to raise money so that her daughter Sienna can get a voice

Sienna was diagnosed with Opitz syndrome, a metabolic disorder that affects physical and mental development

Her family have been saving up to buy her special computer equipment which will allow her to talk for the first time.

Ms Pearson, 30, said: 'She is a very special little girl but she is unable to speak.

'She gets frustrated about not being able to communicate with everyone.

'I have always been Sienna's voice and have had to fight for everything for her - but I want to give her the voice she never had.'

Sienna was just eight months old when she was diagnosed with Opitz syndrome, a metabolic disorder that affects physical and mental development.

Her parents believe she is the only child in the UK with this condition and she has battled with medical problems throughout her life.

Until now mother Natalie Pearce has had to be her daughter's voice

But her mother is determined her daughter should live as full a life as possible and Sienna is now at a mainstream school, St Illtyd's Primary in Llantwit Major.

The mother-of-three is hoping to give her a specialist computerised communication aid and completed a fundraising sky dive to help get together the £2,500 needed.

She said: 'She had a trial session using the equipment recently and she typed "I want to talk to my mummy" - it was heartbreaking.

'She surprised everyone with her knowledge, she understands a lot more than we give her credit for, she's quite intelligent.

'I'm very proud to be her mummy - I just wish she could tell me everything she feels like my other girls.'
