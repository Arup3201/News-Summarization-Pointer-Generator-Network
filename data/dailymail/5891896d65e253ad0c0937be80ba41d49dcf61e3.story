The accused: Ahmed Sofyan faces multiple charges after a 13-year-old girl says he molested her aboard the ship

A family's dream vacation turned into a nightmare when a 13-year-old girl accused a Disney Cruise Line worker of molested her on board a ship while it was docked at Port Canaveral.

Ahmed Sofyan, 37, of Jakarta, Indonesia, was charged with two counts of lewd or lascivious molestation and one count of false imprisonment after being taken into custody Thursday by authorities.

The cruise line notified both local authorities and the FBI when it learned of the claims made by the girl, according to WKMG. It occurred aboard the Disney Dream ship.

‘We have no tolerance whatsoever for the behavior alleged in this incident,’ Karl Holz, President of Disney Cruise Line, said in a press release. 

‘We are sorry that anything of this nature could have occurred on one of our ships,’ he continued.‘We place enormous value on the trust our guests have in us, and nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of each and every one of our guests.’

The incident was reported by the Orlando Sentinel to have occurred during ‘turnaround day,’ when passengers disembark and others board.

While docked: The incident reportedly happened while the ship was still in Port Canaveral

Nightmare: The girl and her family were aboard the Disney Dream cruise ship

The victim has not been identified.

Sofyan has been fired by Disney.

He is currently cooling his heels in Brevard County Jail.

It is not clear if Sofyan has a lawyer.

This incident mirrors another from August 2012, when an employee was seen on surveillance footage fondling and kissing an 11-year-old girl.

He escaped prosecution after the cruise line failed to notify authorities and bought him a plane ticket home to India from the Bahamas, according to WKMG.

The girl’s parents declined to press charges in that incident.
