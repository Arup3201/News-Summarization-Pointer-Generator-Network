Cristiano Ronaldo scored in his 14th consecutive home game as Real Madrid made light work of beating Athletic Bilbao. He also made it an incredible 22 league hat-tricks equalling the record held by Alfredo di Stefano and Telmo Zarra.

The 5-0 victory was a BBC production with 'Bale, Benzema and Cristiano' too much for the visitors – Gareth Bale set up two of Ronaldo's goals and Karim Benzema also scored twice with Ronaldo taking yet another match ball home.

'We are still getting better, this is still the start of the season' said the record breaking scorer. 'The BBC is working well. We are used to playing together and we keep scoring goals.

If Ronaldo makes it 15 straight home matches scoring, Barcelona will be the victims with the season's first clasico the next Santiago Bernabeu fixture. Real will play Liverpool once either side of the Barça game and with 17 goals in 11 games so far this season Ronaldo is in frightening form.

It took him all of two minutes to score the first, heading in Bale's right-footed cross. Cue a celebratory dance involving Ronaldo, Marcelo and James Rodriguez – it might just as well have been a victory jig such is Athletic's woeful record against Real Madrid. They have now lost on their last ten visits to the Santiago Bernabeu.

Bale then nearly laid the second on a plate for Karim Benzema who missed the chance. He was defended before the game by coach Carlo Ancelotti against the suggestion that he needs to work harder but the former Tottenham man was certainly putting in a shift as Real continued to dominate albeit with limited success against an Athletic side playing the offside trap well and catching out Real nine times in the first half hour.

The offside trap couldn't save them on four minutes before the half time whistle however when Benzema climbed above everyone else in the Athletic Bilbao six-yard box to head home Real's second from a Modric corner.

Rafael Varane replaced Sergio Ramos at half time with the defender withdrawn complaining of a calf muscle. Real allowed Athletic two early corners but were soon threatening on the counter attack with Ronaldo racing clear and setting up Bale who blazed over. He made amends 10 minutes into the second half with an assist for Ronaldo's second goal.

It was pure BBC as Benzema sent Bale galloping down the right and he crossed for Cristiano to score.

Athletic had a rare opportunity at the other end but Iker Casillas got down sharply to his left to prevent Ibai Gomez' effort beating him at his near post.

Benzema got his second and Madrid's fourth from Ronaldo's cross and it was show of selflessness from the Portuguese on a hat-trick but squaring the ball to his often criticized team-mate. It was Ronaldo's 50th assist in a Madrid shirt.

He threatened to grab his hat-trick with a header from Carvajal's cross but it was saved by Gorka Iraizoz. Moments later he had the third although he knew little about it, turning Pepe's shot in with his hip amid complaints from Athletic players that the ball had also touched his elbow. Despite it being the fifth in an easy win, and also slightly fortuitous, Ronaldo celebrated it with all the usual gusto.

He now has 13 goals this season in the league and 17 in total. With the double-header against Liverpool on the horizon and Barcelona the next visitors to the Bernabeu he could not be in better form.
