Stacked up one on top of the other, these steak pies would measure 1,237 times the height of the Kelpies structure at Helix Park, Falkirk, Scotland. 

The 200,000 pastry goods have been produced by Scottish family firm Malcolm Allan just for this year's Hogmanay celebrations - their 'biggest number yet'.

The traditional Scottish New Year's dinner dish came about as New Year's Day is not a holiday - so families who were too busy to cook opted instead to buy big steak pies from their local butcher.

Brother Gordon and James Allan run the business, which celebrated its 60th anniversary last year

The butcher business, in Larbert, Stirlingshire, which celebrated its 60th anniversary last year, was launched by Malcolm Allan, with the third generation of the family now involved in running it.

Gordon Allan, who runs the business along with his brother James, said: 'It's great to be introducing our biggest number of pies. 

'We are totally focused on providing first class quality that exceeds expectations.' 

The pies will be sold in Asda's Scottish stores. 

Every year around 575,000 Malcolm Allan steak pies are sold in Asda's Scottish stores - enough to feed 2.3 million people.

The family makes more than 11 million slices of lorne sausage (square sausages) each year, making 65 per cent of the sausage in Scotland.

Currently, the Allan family are selling 20 tonnes each week as shoppers opt to buy more locally produced foods.

'The support that Asda gives suppliers in Scotland really is second to none, and it's great to see a retailer actively promoting Scottish producers, ' Mr Allan continued.

Asda's regional buying manager for Scotland, Brian O'Shea, said: 'We are very proud to support local suppliers and in doing so offer our shoppers great tasting regional products.'
