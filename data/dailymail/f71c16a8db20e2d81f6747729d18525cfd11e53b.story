A school bus driver forced a 6-year-old boy to exit at the wrong stop, an Indianapolis mother claimed this week. 

The woman, Kelly Beers, has said her son Cameron had to walk home through knee-deep snow on the side of a heavily-trafficked road.

Beers told a local television station that Cameron was distraught when he raced back to the family's apartment.

'I just saw him run around the corner with snow up to his knees,' Beers recalled in an interview with WXIN-TV. 'His face was red and he was crying. I’m like "What happened?"

Student: Kelly Beers has claimed that a school bus driver forced her 6-year-old son Cameron, seen here, to get off at the wrong stop

The way back: The stop was approximately a half-mile from where Cameron lives, and his trek involved knee-high snow

'He said, "The bus driver dropped me off at the wrong stop and he wouldn't listen to me when I told him I don't live there."'

The incident happened Monday on the city's southwest side, WXIN-TV reported.

According to Beers, the substitute driver would not listen to Cameron after he said he didn't exit at the final stop on the route.

'I said, "Well did you tell him that you don't live over there?"' Beers told WXIN-TV. 'He said, "Yes but he wouldn't listen to me." And I wish I could see the video, but ironically, it wasn't working.' 

The stop was approximately a half-mile from where Cameron lives and his trek involved knee-high snow, WXIN-TV reported.

The boy's adoptive father was killed by a car last year while walking next to a road when deep snow covered the sidewalks.

School: Cameron is a student at Blue Academy, part of the Metropolitan School District of Decatur Township

Beers also told WXIN-TV of her son 'He could have gotten hit. It could have took one slip on Lynhurst [the road where he got off].'

According to the Fox affiliate, Cameron's normal bus was being worked on so he took an alternate bus to school - and he  took the alternate bus when school was out since he didn't know the normal bus was operating again.

Officials with the school district told WXIN-TV they continue to look into the matter and will consider how to keep it from happening again.
