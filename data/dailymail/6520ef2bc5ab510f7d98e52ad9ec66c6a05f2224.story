They are two of Tinseltown's most fashionable parents, so it's hardly surprising that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have channeled their expertise into designing children's clothing ranges.

While Kanye has been using daughter North as his muse, Kim and her sisters have shared the latest designs from their kidswear range on social media - and they're a far cry from the garments that fill little Nori's wardrobe.

The collection, which is an extension of Kim, Khloe and Kourtney's globally-successful Kardashian Kollection for adults, includes a soft tulle skirt with rose gold foil detailing, a woven broderie lace dress with rose gold buttons, and a zip-through bomber jacket and beaded, feathered headband.

The garments are priced at around £15 and Toys R Us, who stock the range, describe it as: 'adorable outfits for your little one in the hottest trend-setting styles'

Toys R Us, which stocks the range, describe it as: 'adorable outfits for your little one in the hottest trend-setting styles'.

Each of the designs, while not necessarily the personal handiwork of Kim, 34, Khloe, 30 and Kourtney, 35, have all been given the seal of approval by the sisters and cost, on average, around £15 per garment. 

The sisters certainly have experience when it comes to dressing little ones; Kourtney welcomed her daughter Penelope, her second child with long-term partner Scott Disick, in July 2012, while Kim and Kanye West's daughter North was born on June 15 last year. 

Kardashian Kids for girls was launched in 2014 and the new drop, as well as a brand new boys line, is hitting shelves in March.

Kim said that the sisters looked into gentle fabrics that were also functional, but North hasn't worn any pieces from the range yet

'Our fans have been asking us to design looks for boys ever since we launched styles for girls,' said Khloe. 'It's difficult to find fashionable items for boys,' added Kourtney.

'With that in mind, we wanted to deliver special patterns and styles that were cool and unique at an attainable price point.' 

Kim said that the sisters looked into gentle fabrics that were also functional. 'My favorite piece is the French terry track pant,' the 34-year-old said. 

However, baby North hasn't been seen rocking any of the designs over fashion week and instead prefers to wear her father's clothing collection.

Kourtney took to Instagram to promote the sisters' new range of kidswear 

Kim outraged fans on Tuesday by posting a picture of her 20-month-old daughter North West wearing a 'baby bulletproof vest' from Kanye's latest clothing range

In fact, Kim  outraged fans on Tuesday by posting a picture of her 20-month-old daughter wearing a 'baby bulletproof vest' from Kanye's latest clothing range.

North West was seen on Kim's Instagram wearing the piece 37-year-old Kanye's latest collection - she also wore the number to his fashion show in New York on Thursday.

Kim, 34, captioned the image with the words: 'Look at my little cutie!!! #DaddysMuse #BabyYeezy BulletProofVest.'

But the reality star's fans didn't seem too convinced by the latest fashion accessory. 

Little North prefers to wear darker colours and even had Alexander Wang create a custom design for her, left

One follower, summmms wrote: 'Can this child ever be a normal baby girl and wear some colors, a bow? Anything? So sad what your doing to your child.' [sic]

Therealjuhollings added: 'a baby bullet proof vest?' 

But others defended the unusual choice of attire: ___itsjustgina said: 'The bullet proof vest is actually cute very 90's,' while talevska_ remarked: 'So cute.'

Still, North herself didn't appear to be too sure about the trend led piece and was pictured bursting into tears while watching her father's first Adidas Originals x Kanye West Yeezy collection alongside her mother and Beyonce.
