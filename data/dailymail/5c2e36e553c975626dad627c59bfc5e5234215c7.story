A new breast cancer drug which extends women's lives by almost six months is now available for patients

A new drug for breast cancer which extends women’s lives by almost six months while reducing toxic side effects including hair loss is now available for patients.

Campaigners claim the drug Kadcyla offers a ‘precious lifeline’ for women with the most aggressive form of the disease who have tried other treatments.

It is the first medicine of its kind for breast cancer and is designed to destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue from unnecessary damage.

Kadcyla, also called T-DM1, combines the original ‘wonder’ drug Herceptin with a potent chemotherapy agent.

It is expected up to 1,300 women a year in England could benefit from the drug, which costs £6,000 a month.

Results from a major trial show it prolonged the lives of patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer by 30.9 months compared with 25.1 months on standard therapy.

Patients had fewer, less severe side effects and reported a better quality of life.

Around 10,000 British women have HER2-positive breast cancer diagnosed each year, about one in five of those affected.

Paul Ellis, Professor of Cancer Medicine at King’s College London, said: ‘Kadcyla represents a new way of targeting HER2-positive breast cancer, which ultimately means that we could extend patients’ lives compared to existing chemotherapy treatment.

‘In addition, we should be able to reduce many of the symptomatic side effects associated with standard chemotherapy.’

Kadcyla seeks out and kills cancerous cells in a two-stage attack. It attaches to the tumour cell and blocks signals that encourage the cancer to grow and spread, then breaches the outer defences and releases a payload of chemotherapy to destroy it from within.

Because its action is so precise, a normally toxic form of chemotherapy can be used but healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage.

The cancer is delayed from returning and side effects from chemotherapy such as diarrhoea and hair loss are significantly reduced.

Made by Roche, Kadcyla is administered intravenously once every three weeks. Professor Ellis, who also works at Guy’s Hospital, London, said at least 1,000 women a year would benefit from the drug after relapsing, but eventually it might be used before the disease spread, possibly replacing current treatment using Herceptin and chemotherapy as separate agents.

Trials at earlier stages are taking place, he added, and it was possible the technology could be effective in treating other types of tumour.

Emma Pennery, of Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘The priority now must be that Kadcyla is made widely available across the UK as soon as possible for patients with advanced breast cancer whose lives could be extended from its use.’

Kadcyla will be available to patients in England through the Cancer Drugs Fund and requests for the treatment can also be made in other parts of Britain.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Scottish Medicines Consortium will decide whether the NHS should fund it in the longer term.

Dr Caitlin Palframan, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘While we are very pleased that this new treatment will now be made available on the Cancer Drugs Fund throughout England, it’s important to point out that this fund is only guaranteed until 2016.’
