A former director of Chester City has been arrested over the sale of £4million worth of the illegal party drug mephedrone.

Paula White, an accountant who was part of the senior team at the now-defunct football club for a three-week period in March 2007, was one of 12 people taken into custody during the country’s biggest crackdown on the sale of the class-B drug since it was banned three years ago.

The 44-year-old was arrested at her luxury £800,000 Victorian home in Eccles, Greater Manchester, on the suspicion of supplying controlled drugs and money laundering.

Flamboyant: Paula White had extravagant parties at her luxury £800,000 home

Yesterday her imposing home, which 
includes an indoor swimming pool and a sun room, was being searched by 
police, who also seized her £120,000 Aston Martin from the driveway.

Officers from Greater Manchester said 
the raids were linked to the sale of 690lb of the drug – also known as 
MCAT, meow meow or bubble – which had a street value of £3.8million.

It was allegedly distributed through a website run from an industrial unit in nearby Bolton and advertised as plant food.

The website sold 35 different products and had processed tens of thousands of transactions over the past 12 months.

Although marketed as horticultural 
supplies, customer feedback on the site warned that the drugs were too 
dangerous to be taken with alcohol.

The website has since been closed down.

Luxury: Police officers searched the £800,000 home of Paula White, a 44-year-old businesswoman

Searched: Miss White's £120,000 Aston Martin was also seized by police 

Businesswoman: Miss White runs several media and leisure firms and was on the board of Chester City FC

Last month Emma Johnston, 21, and 
father-of-one Chris Goodwin, 30, collapsed and died within minutes of 
each other after taking a mixture of alcohol, amphetamine and mephedrone
during an all-night party in Bolton.

Three other friends were also treated in hospital but recovered.

The source of the mephedrone they took is still unknown.

Miss White, who ran a number of media 
and leisure firms, was the former director and accountant of Chester 
City FC and the ex-boss of Widnes Rugby League Club.

Powders: These labelled tubs appear to contain bulking agents

One neighbour said Miss White always wore designer suits, adding: ‘That was her style.

‘She was obviously very successful and
mingled with the top of society, very successful people.

'She was quite 
pleasant but she is also a very tough woman who doesn’t suffer fools or 
bad tradesmen gladly. She is very feisty and very confident.

‘She always had personal trainers going to the house and had six dogs, little yappy things.

‘Her house is like something out of Hello! magazine. The interior is absolutely stunning with a designer kitchen and wet rooms.

‘I have a large garden but hers must have been about four times the size.

‘I once got invited to a party. It was very swish. There were men at the door ticking your name off.’

Refrigerated: Foil-packed goods appear to have been stored in this fridge

Packages: The warehouse contained several large boxes

Machinery: There were a number of electrical items in the unit

Equipment: Police also discovered machinery inside the industrial unit in Bolton

Another local who saw the police 
operation said yesterday: ‘I was going to work at about 3pm when I saw 
three police units outside her house.

‘By the time I got home, every single light in the house was on.

‘They were emptying boxes  and loading them into vans  until 10.30pm.’

Towed: Miss White's Aston Martin was seized by police

Illegal: Mephedrone, known as MCAT and meow, meow, was a legal high but was outlawed in 2010

Investigation: Forensic teams searched 11 addresses for evidence

Greater Manchester Police said the 12 
arrested had been under surveillance since the end of last year after 
parcels were intercepted in the post and found to contain illegal drugs.

They were traced back to a warehouse in the Farnworth area of  Bolton, and on Wednesday officers raided 11 homes.

They arrested four men and five women, aged 21 to 62, on suspicion of the supply of controlled drugs and money laundering.

A 48-year-old man was also arrested on
suspicion of the cultivation of cannabis, and two men, aged 29 and 30, 
were taken in for questioning on suspicion of possession with intent to 
supply.

All remain in police custody.

Warehouse: Officers raided an industrial unit in Bolton, believed to be where the website was run from

Search: Forensics teams scoured the site for evidence during the series of raids

Drugs: Police are investigating the sale of 313kg of mephedrone worth £3.8million

Outlawed: Mephedrone is also known as MCAT, bubble or meow meow and was made illegal in 2010

Record: Police said this was the biggest operation of its kind since mephedrone was made illegal

Gang: Police arrested seven men and five women in connection with a website allegedly selling illegal drugs

Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson,
of the North West Regional Crime Squad, said: ‘These strikes have taken
months of planning and the operation reinforces our commitment to 
dismantle organised crime groups and tackle illegal drugs across our 
region.

‘Our priority is to disrupt and prevent the supply of drugs.

‘Let this be a reminder to anyone 
involved in the supply, that they will not only end up behind bars, but 
through the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation, they will also end up out
of pocket.’
