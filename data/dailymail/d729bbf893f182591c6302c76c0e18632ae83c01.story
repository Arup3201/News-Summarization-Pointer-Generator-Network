Aldi has beaten Waitrose and Marks & Spencer to be crowned the nation’s favourite supermarket, according to the annual Which? survey.

Customers voted it the best supermarket as it provided value for money and helped to ‘ease the impact of increasing food prices on day-to-day budgets’.

The supermarket narrowly beat Waitrose, which has been voted the best UK supermarket every year since the survey started in 2007.

Number one: Aldi has beaten Waitrose and Marks & Spencer to be crowned the nation¿s favourite supermarket

High quality: The report said Aldi's customers love its pricing, fresh food and range of products

The authors wrote: ‘Aldi customers love its pricing and also rate it highly for the quality of fresh food, its range of products and how easy it is to find items.

‘The single most important factor for shoppers when deciding which supermarket to buy from is that it offers good value, and [customers] clearly see Aldi as number one in this department.

Bargain hunting has become such a national pastime that the thrifty 
middle classes are now spending £20  a week in pound and 99p 
stores.

They are not just shopping in Aldi and Lidl, but are supplementing their weekly shop with even cheaper deals.

Memories of a deep recession and a fear that hard times could return have led to an obsession with finding the best value.

A
 new report by Rowan, a specialist discount wholesaler, shows 63 per 
cent of us now shop in places such as Poundland or 99p Stores.

And it is certainly not the preserve of those on lower incomes.

In fact, 49 per cent of those in households earning 50,000 pounds or more shop in them.

‘Shoppers told us that supermarkets generally aren’t helping to ease the impact of increasing food prices on their day-to-day budgets. But Aldi is a rare exception - 80per cent think it’s helping with this.’

More than 7,000 shoppers were asked about how satisfied they were as customers and whether they would recommend a supermarket to a friend.

They were then asked to score supermarkets on pricing, customer service, the quality of fresh produce, the store environment, how well-stocked they were and how easy it was to find items.

Aldi came first at 76per cent, followed by Waitrose at 75per cent and Marks & Spencer at 73per cent. Next in line were Lidl, Iceland, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.

Tesco, the country’s biggest supermarket, scored just 57per cent in terms of customer satisfaction. The Cooperative was last of the big supermarkets at 50per cent.

Ocado came top of the ‘online only’ category, receiving a score of 78per cent for customer satisfaction followed by Waitrose at 73per cent and Sainsbury’s at 73per cent.

The authors said: ‘Aldi has earned the top spot in the Which? supermarket survey, and value for money is the biggest reason why.

‘Aldi received a maximum five-star rating for pricing and special offers, and almost all of its customers (96per cent) said that it offers good value for money - more than any other supermarket in our survey.’

They added: ‘But Aldi wouldn’t be loved by its customers if it was just cheap. It was also rated highly for filing [customers’] trolley and the quality of its fresh food.’

Losing out: Waitrose has dropped to second place have previously been named Britain's best supermarket every year since 2007

Last year, Waitrose scored 82per cent while Aldi scored 74per cent. Tesco came last at 45per cent.

The Which? survey also revealed that supermarket customers’ biggest pricing irritation is when products are mislabelled as being on offer.

The consumer group said it was meeting with major supermarkets and Government to campaign against changes to misleading multibuy offers.

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘With rising food prices, one of consumers’ top financial worries and household budgets being squeezed, it’s no surprise that the supermarket that scored the highest on value for money was rated the best in our survey.

‘People tell us their biggest bugbear with supermarket pricing is confusing labelling on special offers, so we want supermarkets to treat their customers fairly by scrapping misleading price promotions and make special offers special.’
