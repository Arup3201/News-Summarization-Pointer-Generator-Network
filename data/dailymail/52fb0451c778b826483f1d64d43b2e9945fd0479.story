Take a look at these ‘street ornaments’. Now please try to stop sniggering.

Businesses in a region of Manhattan, New York, are getting rid of these stone street barriers resembling breasts as they find them an eyesore.

The bollards have turned into the Meatpacking District’s laughing stock, so locals want them removed and the street plazas they occupy redeveloped.

Not welcome: Stone street barriers resembling breasts are being removed from plazas in the Meatpacking District region of Manhattan, New York

‘They’re the breasts,’ Gaslight Lounge bar owner Matt DeMatt told the New York Post. ‘They just sit out there and do nothing.’

The barricades were put up in 2008 and since the High Line raised park was opened last year they can be seen more obviously from above.

Now a neighbourhood business group says it wants to get rid of the installations at six plazas to improve the look and feel of the area.

City officials opened the plazas as an experiment and they have since spread to different areas of the city, reported the New York Post.

The project to overhaul the area and remove the bollards will cost $500,000 and this is being split between the city and a business group.

‘The plazas look neglected, dirty and unkempt,’ Lauren Danziger, of the Meatpacking District Improvement Association told the New York Post.

Her group pitched a plan designed by Ken Smith, the architect who landscaped the Museum of Modern Art’s rooftop garden.

The city has agreed to remove the old plaza installations and remake them - in addition to opening a seventh, reported the New York Post.

The bollards will be replaced by white cones and tables with parasols and chairs in a transformation project to start next month.

But some locals say the bollards were only supposed to be temporary and clubbers just loiter in the plazas at night while dropping litter there.
