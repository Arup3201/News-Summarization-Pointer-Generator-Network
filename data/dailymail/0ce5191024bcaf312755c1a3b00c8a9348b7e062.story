Centre-forward: Lambert will wear the squad number from next season

‘I've always seen myself as a No.9 as it's the type of player I am, and to get it at Liverpool is unbelievable.

‘I would have been happy with any number because as long as that badge is on the front I would have been happy with any shirt, but to get No.9 is special for me.’

Meanwhile, Lambert admits he was nervous ahead of his Reds bow.

‘It was special. I had to get a few moments in check at the beginning, but it was special,’ he added.

‘Obviously I'm professional, I'm 32 now and I'm able to get my emotions in check, and now it's all about my fitness.

‘That's all I was concentrating on, trying my best and trying to get a goal. I was a little bit disappointed not to get a goal but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

‘I was nervous before kick-off and I probably haven't been that nervous for a while. I've played in a lot of big games in my career and that's the most nervous I've been before a game for a while, but it was a special moment for me and one I'll remember.’
