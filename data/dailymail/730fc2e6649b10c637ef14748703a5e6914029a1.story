Holly Hewett is warning others not to charge their phones overnight after her Samsung smartphone caught fire

A woman has told of her terror after she woke up to find her phone on fire beside her bed.

Holly Hewett, 25, was asleep when she was woken by a 'sizzling sound' and the smell of burning.

She looked down and saw her Samsung Galaxy S4 smouldering as it charged on the carpeted floor next to her.

Miss Hewett grabbed the smartphone and ran to the bathroom and threw it in the sink.

The civil servant said: 'I woke up at 4.30am when my boyfriend got up to go to work and looked at my phone to check the time.

'I noticed it was running low on battery so I plugged it in and put it on charge.

'At about 5am I checked the time again then rolled over and went back to sleep, but within about 10 minutes of that I heard a sizzling sound.

'Even though it was dark I could smell the smoke. I picked it up and the screen sparked.

'As I walked to the bathroom the battery fell out of the casing at the back onto the floor.

'I didn’t burn myself but there's a hole in the carpet where it scorched it. The smell was awful, so I opened a window.'

She added: 'I was on my own and panicked because I'd got no house phone so I didn’t know how to contact anyone to let them know what had happened.

'In the end, after unplugging everything, I drove to my dad's house.'

There are many reasons a phone could burst into flames.

Lots of manufacturers have blamed knock off charger suppliers, who cut corners in their manufacturing.    

However, mostly it has to do with the quality of the capacitor and circuit protector in the inner workings of the phone.

If these are faulty, failing to either keep the current in the phone to a low voltage, or failing to keep the hot circuits from the plastic phone coating, there can be an exponential increase in heat in the phone.

This may lead to the capacitor breaking down and sending several hundred volts of electricity into the battery.

This is often more than the lithium based batteries can take, and they either expand due to the bending and melting of the battery's shape, or burn up and catch fire, due to the increased heat inside the phone.

The incident happened at Miss Hewett's flat in Kemsley, Kent around 5.15am last Friday morning.

She said: 'I've never had anything like this happen to me before. It had only been charging for about 50 minutes, if that.

'I was extremely lucky. I'd warn others not to put their phones on charge while they are sleeping.

'Luckily I'm not a very deep sleeper, any sound usually wakes me up, but it could have been a different story.'

It is not the first time smartphones and tablets have been reported to suddenly catch fire.

Last June, a man in Hong Kong claimed
 his flat was destroyed by fire after his Galaxy S4 burst into flames 
while he was playing the game Love Machine.

A month later, Swiss teenager Fanny 
Schlatter, 18, suffered second and third degree burns when her 
smartphone apparently exploded in her pocket.

Last
 year, a brand new iPad Air exploded in flames while charging in a 
Vodafone mobile phone store in Camberra, Australia, store workers said.

Samsung have assured customers they have robust safety standards and will investigate Miss Hewett's device when they receive it

And in 2012, a schoolboy in Coventry was burned when his Blackberry Curve 9320 exploded in the middle of the night.

A Samsung spokesman said: 'Once we have received the product in question, we will conduct a thorough examination to determine the exact cause of the incident.

'We would like to assure our customers that we employ robust quality controls and standards to ensure the safety of our products.'

This case is not the first case recorded of this model of Samsung phone catching fire under suspicious circumstances.

December 2013

A user of the model in Canada reported his Galaxy S4 spontaneously catching fire using a post on YouTube.

The phone was apparently charging, when the port next to the battery suddenly burst into flames, causing a small fire.

July 2013

Even earlier in the year a house was set on fire in Hong Kong after the same make of phone burst into flames.

The
 owner of the phone, a man named Du, was playing a game on the Galaxy S4
 when it burst into flames, causing him to throw the phone across the 
room, where it landed on his sofa.

The phone then exploded and set fire to his entire house, eventually burning it to the ground. 

In June of 2013, a Hong Kong resident claims his flat was destroyed by fire after his Galaxy S4 burst into flames while he was playing the game Love Machine

August 2013

Only a month later, a Swiss teenager 
suffered second and third degree burns when her smartphone apparently 
exploded in her pocket.

Fanny Schlatter, 18, was injured when the Samsung Galaxy S3 allegedly blew up in her trouser pocket.

February 2014

An American teenager in Maine suffered burns after her iPhone 5C 
burst into flames in her back pocket, and set her trousers alight.

The girl, who was not named, was burned on the thigh and back when her iPhone started smouldering in her back pocket.

Classmates
 heard a pop and saw smoke billowing around the 14-year-old, who had to 
remove her trousers in class to get away from the fire.

November 2011

An iPhone 4 burst into flames mid-flight on an Australian Airline flight.

On its flight ZL319 from Lismore to Sydney the mobile phone starting to emit dense smoke and 'glow red' after the plane landed.

The flight attendant extinguished the smoke along with the 'glow', and nobody was harmed, but the plane was stuck on the tarmac for longer than planned after landing.
