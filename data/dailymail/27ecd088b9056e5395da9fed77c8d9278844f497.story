Those senior moments when you lose your glasses or forget someone’s name could one day be just a distant memory.

A drug already used to treat motor neurone disease could prevent common memory lapses which can affect healthy people in their forties.

Researchers found the drug Riluzole prevented connections between brain cells from weakening in experiments on older rats.

Senior moment? You're not alone - but a drug could help prevent the brain's breakdown (posed by model)

This is thought to prevent the cognitive deterioration that can occur in old age.

Professor Bruce McEwen, of The Rockefeller University, New York, said: ‘By examining the neurological changes that occurred after Riluzole treatment, we discovered one way in which the brain’s ability to reorganise itself – its neuroplasticity – can be marshalled to protect it against some of the deterioration that can accompany old age, at least in rodents.’

Riluzole works by helping control a chemical called glutamate which helps neurons communicate. But too much glutamate causes damage at the point at which the cells connect – their synapses.

The team started giving the drug to rats once they reached ten months old, the rodent equivalent of middle age, when their cognitive decline typically begins.

After 17 weeks of treatment, the animals performed better in memory tests than the ones left untreated, and almost as well as young rats, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported.

For instance, when placed in a maze they had already explored, the treated rats recognised an unfamiliar pathway as such and spent more time investigating it.

When the researchers looked inside the brains of treated rats, they found changes to glutamate within the hippocampus, where memories are consolidated, suggesting communication between brain cells had improved.

Prof John Morrison, of Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, said: 'We have found in many cases, ageing involves synaptic changes that decrease synaptic strength, the plasticity of synapses, or both.

'The fact Riluzole increased the clustering of only the thin, most plastic spines, suggests its enhancement of memory results from both an increase in synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity, which might explain its therapeutic effectiveness.'

In this case, the clusters involved thin spines which are rapidly adaptable.

The treated animals had more clustering than the young animals and their untreated peers, who had the least.

This discovery led the researchers to speculate that, in general, the aged Riluzole appears to enhance this mechanism.

Researcher Ana Pereira, an instructor in clinical investigation in Prof McEwen's lab, added: 'In our study, this phenomenon of clustering proved to be the core underlying mechanism that prevented age-related cognitive decline.'
