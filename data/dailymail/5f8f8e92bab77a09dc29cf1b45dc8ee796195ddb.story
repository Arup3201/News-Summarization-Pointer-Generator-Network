The sole adult afflicted by a mystery Tourette's-like illness that swept the small town of Le Roy, New York, in late 2011 has told how her body 'hurt' and her head would become locked to one side.

Marge Fitzsimmons, 36, joined eighteen high school students who were suddenly struck down by terrifying, undiagnosable symptoms which included severe twitching and shouting episodes.

Speaking for the first time since her recovery in a new documentary titled The Town That Caught Tourette's, airing tonight on TLC at 10pm ET/PT, Ms Fitzsimmons states: 'Everyone kept on referring to, "it's only affecting teenagers", and it wasn't.'

Shaken: Marge Fitzsimmons was the only adult gripped by a mystery Tourette's-like syndrome that swept the small town of Le Roy, New York, in late 2011

In a preview clip for the hour-long program the nurse practitioner explains how, in a state of panic, she consulted medics who concluded that her stress levels were sky-high.

'My doctor said "Everything that you've ever suppressed in your whole life has just erupted like a volcano."

In October 2011 she started experiencing sudden head jerks followed by vocal tics. At one point she decided to leave work early in fear of losing her job.

Recalling her deteriorating condition, Ms Fitzsimmons says: 'If anybody touched me it would hurt 
even more. So I couldn't be touched.

'My head it actually stuck right 
here . . .My chin was on the back side of my shoulder.'

When news of the bizarre outbreak first surfaced it was thought to be caused by a condition prevalent in children, as all of the cases involved students from Le Roy High School.

However, when details of Ms Fitzsimmons' situation emerged researchers had to come up with a new theory.

As time went on and no direct cause or cure was 
identified, worry turned to fear, panic and suspicion, particularly as 
the wider world began to show an interest. And the new footage highlights this terror.

'I don't understand it - something is not right,' one parent tells the camera.

Another suggests drugs may be involved, adding: 'It's either completely unrelated or they've all gotten into something.'

One of the younger sufferers is seen insisting: 'Seriously, why would we fake this?'

The TLC film examines the various speculated causes of the 
Tourette's-like tics, as well as the rising fear that something serious 
was being covered up.

'There might be some sort of cover up,' one man is heard suggesting. 'Whatever it is, it may be spreading.'

Another says: 'Please, just tell us what this is and where it came from and how we can get rid of it.'And
a woman's voice is full of frustration as she tells the camera: 'Stop 
lying to me and just tell me you don't know what the hell's going on!'

In total, 19 patients came forward with Tourette’s like symptoms, which include uncontrollable facial and body twitching.

At one point in the TLC program one patient is heard saying between tics:  'The electrical shock feeling that I get in my spine never goes away.'

Another, also visibly affected, says: 'I was always so active . . . I don't feel like myself . . . anymore.

The
true cause of the illness is still a mystery, but the documentary 
explores different possible causes such as infections, environmental 
influences, conversion disorder and even Lyme disease.

Among those who have taken an interest in the case is environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich, best known as the woman portrayed by Julia Roberts in the eponymous 2000 movie.

She
has suggested that a chemical spill from a train derailment in the 
1970s near the site of the girls’ school may be the cause. 

But
doctors who have treated or tested the girls in Le Roy believe they are
suffering from conversion disorder, or the twitching symptoms are 
possibly related to an infection.

'I feel like people look at me and judge me'

More recently, Facebook and YouTube were being blamed for the mystery illness.

Doctors
said that symptoms are being ‘reinforced and magnified’ because victims
of the bizarre condition are uploading videos of themselves onto social
networking sites to appeal for help.

They
argue that when other people in the town of Le Roy view the videos, they
are unconsciously mimicking what they see and spreading it around.

David
Lichter, professor of neurology at the University of Buffalo, who has 
treated several of the patients, told MSNBC: 'It's remarkable to see how
one individual posts something, and then the next person who posts 
something not only are the movements bizarre and not consistent with 
known movement disorders, but it's the same kind of movements.

'This mimicry goes on with Facebook or YouTube exposure. This is the modern way that symptomology could be spread.’

Researchers
have also come up with a string of theories and believe teenagers may 
have been struck down by pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric 
syndrome, or PANS, which is a kind of OCD linked to strep throat.

Other believe that Morgellons could be to blame, which is a disease that causes patients to sprout painful sores.

Some
doctors have also suggested it could be a mass psychogenic illness 
which can be triggered by stress and is spread from unconscious mimicry 
of one another.

Dr. 
Laszlo Mechtler, chief of neurology at the Dent Neurologic Institute in 
Buffalo, said: 'When one has a symptom, it can be reinforced and magnified with other individuals with similar symptoms.

'That's
what's going on with these girls. They are in a segregated small rural 
town in New York state. They are a cohesive group. And this wildfire of 
symptoms takes control.'

Local hazard: Environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich has suggested that a chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls' school may be the cause

During
an angry meeting with school officials in February 2012, parents asked 
why the soil around a natural gas well which had been dug on school 
ground had not been tested for contamination.

'This
could take years! What are you doing to protect my kid? What are you 
doing to protect these peoples kids?' said parent Patrick Frauley.

'I'm not looking for a lawsuit of any kind, I just want my daughter to get better,' said Beth Miller.

Adding
to the concern was that the wells were drilled using the controversial 
hydraulic fracturing method, also known as ‘fracking’.

Dr
Greg Young of the New York State Department of Health had earlier 
explained that tests had ruled out environmental factors as the cause of
the disease.

He also claimed that genetics, antihistamines or head trauma could be to blame.
