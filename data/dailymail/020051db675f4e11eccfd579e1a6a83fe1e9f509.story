Craig Moorhouse, 29, admitted voyeurism after spying on a woman while she undressed at a tanning salon

A man who sneaked into a tanning salon to spy on a half-naked women as she used a sunbed has been banned from entering beauty salons throughout the UK.

Craig Moorhouse, 29, hid in a cubicle at Kwik Tan in Castleford, West Yorkshire, while a woman undressed to her underwear, a court heard.

Magistrates in Wakefield heard how Moorhouse, who was a member at the salon, was traced by police after staff reviewed CCTV footage which showed him entering the cubicle before the victim.

The woman heard the cubicle's door open when Moorhouse left, and reported the incident to management.

The 29-year-old admitted voyeurism, saying 'I might have been hoping to get sexually aroused' when asked why he went into the cubicle.

Moorhouse however claimed he did not watch the woman undress and hadn't taken pictures of her while he was in the room, saying he was sure she would have felt 'disgusted and sickened' if she'd known he was there.

The court heard the woman told police officers: 'I just can’t get it out of my head that another person has seen my body without my consent.

'I feel horrible and fat and look at myself thinking I’m really ugly.'

Prosecutor Laurie Scott told the court the victim suffered a lack of sleep and was prone to waking up with 'palpitations'.

'I’m extremely nervous about staying in the house alone. Each time someone passes the window I feel they might be looking in at me,' the court heard.

The 29-year-old who was also a member at Kwik Tan in Castleford said he was 'very sorry' about the incident

Staff at the salon in Castleford reviewed CCTV to identify Moorhouse who was a member there. Kwik Tan did not wish to comment on the incident which took place in August

Moorhouse, who was not represented by a solicitor, said the incident was 'a spur-of-the-moment' decision, and didn't know why he did it.

'I'm really sorry about it,' he added.

Moorhouse, of Castleford, admitted voyeurism at the tanning salon, which did not wish to comment on today's verdict.

Bench chairman John Fisher adjourned sentencing until next month to allow time for a probation report on the defendant to be prepared.

Moorhouse was granted conditional bail and told he must not contact the woman or enter any beauty salons in the UK.

His name will be placed on the sex offender register.
