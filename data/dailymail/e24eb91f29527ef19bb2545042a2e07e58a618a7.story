A teacher had sex with a 16-year-old boy pupil in her car - and told him he would be 'a legend' among his friends, a disciplinary hearing was told today.

Emma Ager, 34, picked the teenager up after classes to have sex in her car, according to evidence from a professional conduct hearing in Cardiff.

The hearing was told the English teacher, who worked at Rhymney Comprehensive School in Tredegar, South Wales, told the boy: 'I bet you won’t be able to keep up with me during sex.'

Emma Ager, 34, a teacher who worked at Rhymney Comprehensive School, in Tredegar, South Wales, has been struck off for life after having sex sessions with a 16-year-old boy pupil in her car

The boy - referred to as Pupil A in the hearing - was studying for his GSCEs when Miss Ager began driving him to secret sex sessions in a factory car park.

He told the hearing that his relationship with Miss Ager began after a friend managed to get hold of her mobile phone number.

His pal rang the teacher from Pupil A's phone as a prank - but she rang back.

Pupil A said: 'We chatted and she put a bet on me not being able to keep up with her during sex.'

The former pupil, who is now 22, said he told Miss Ager he was a 16-year-old pupil at her comprehensive school.

The South Wales school attended by the pupil. Now 22, he said the teacher kept a picture of his penis on her mobile phone

Pupil A said: 'She said as long as I kept quiet everything would be OK.

'Following this we would meet up daily or every other day.

'We would meet up an hour or two after school and drive and have sex in her car. We would drive to a secluded spot near a factory.

'We only ever had sex in her car.

'She said if people did find out I would be a legend. It continued for two months.

'One of my friends rang her up to ask for a threesome but she said she wouldn’t do it.

'It was common knowledge among pupils in the school but I don’t know if the teachers knew. I left a short time after it ended.'

The pupil told the hearing Miss Ager bombarded him with phone calls and sexual text messages during the two-month relationship in March 2008

The hearing was told Miss Ager had been teaching for two years at the school when she began having sex with the pupil.

The boy claimed Miss Ager had a picture of his penis on her mobile phone.

He told the hearing he bombarded him with phone calls and sexual text messages during the two-month relationship in March 2008.

Pupil A told the hearing: 'My friends knew what was going on and she would pick me and my friends up to go to McDonald’s and let them drive her car.

'I never had extra tuition from her but one day she said she would do my coursework for me - but she never did.

'On a school trip to London somebody saw she had a photo of my penis on her mobile phone but she said it was somebody else’s.

'She brought me back a teddy and some sweets.'

Pupil A ended the liaison to be get back with his ex-girlfriend.

The General Teaching Council for Wales professional conduct hearing in Cardiff heard Pupil A’s mother found out her son was getting inappropriate phone calls and texts from Miss Ager.

She told the school about the calls from Miss Ager - but she did not know it was a sexual relationship.

GTCW presenting solicitor Martin Jones said Miss Ager was pulled into a meeting with her head teacher about inappropriate contact with Pupil A.

Mr Jones said: 'As a result of that she offered her resignation and it was accepted.

'She left the school a short while later.'

Headteacher Meredydd James is accused of giving good references for future jobs as she left the school.

The hearing was told it was later discovered to be a sexual relationship when school staff went on a safeguarding course - and told council officials about rumours of the affair between teacher and pupil.

Miss Ager is accused of unacceptable professional conduct and falling short of the standard expected of a registered teacher by having an inappropriate and sexual relationship with a 16-year-old pupil.

She is not at the disciplinary hearing and has failed to answer the charges.

The school’s former headteacher Mr James, now retired, is accused of failing to follow proper child protection procedures and take appropriate action.

Mr James denies the charges against him.

The hearing continues.
