Slow-moving lava which has been creeping down a Hawaii mountain since June has reached civilian territory, incinerating a home.

The $200,000 house was cleared out and abandoned by its Oregon-based owners in September and no injuries were reported as molten rock engulfed the structure on Monday, officials said.

It is the first residential property hit by the lava that has crept towards the town of Pahoa, the largest town in Big Island's agricultural Puna district, for weeks.

The molten rock hit the house just before noon, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira.

It took about 45 minutes for the 1,100-square-foot home to burn down, Oliveira said. 

'The house has been destroyed,' he said.

Officials said they will fight any wildfire outbreaks but plan to let sole properties burn if struck by the lava flow. 

Earlier in the day, lava burned down a small corrugated steel storage shed on the property, which is half a mile from its nearing neighbor.

A garage or barn structure still remained on the property, but it was possible that the lava would also consume it. 

Obliterated: Officials said they were powerless to stop the molten rock burn the $200,000 home in the agricultural Puna district

Abandoned: The Oregon-based brothers who owned the home abandoned it and cleared it out in September

A relative of the home's owners, who live on the mainland, arrived at the site to watch the house burn, officials said. That family member drove from another part of the island about two hours away and used an iPhone to take video of the house burning.

The county estimates the value of the home at about $200,000, Oliveira said. 

The 800 residents that reside at the base of Kilauea Volcano were warned of a potential evacuation when it erupted in late June.

Around 50 families in the lava's projected path abandoned their homes. 

The flow entered Puna on October 26 and engulfed a cemetery. 

On Sunday, officials suspected the lava had come to a complete and final standstill 480 feet from the main street that runs through the town, which remains closed.

Devastating: A relative of the owner drove from another part of Hawaii when they realized the house was burning but could only watch

Billowing smoke: Smoke could be seen pouring from the home and officials warned residents with breathing problems to stay inside

Blistering: The burning molten rock is continuing its advance towards Pahoa and other parts such as Leilani

Warning: The flow is still active and the main road of Pahoa town is closed to all residents in case it hits

However, a finger of molten rock broke out from the central flow and poured over the abandoned home.  

According to KITV, wind is blowing heavy smoke south west towards other towns such as Leilani.

Residents with respiratory difficulties have been warned to remain indoors.

Pahoa stands on the site of a
former sugar cane plantation on the eastern edge of the Big
Island.

Kilauea's current eruption began in 1983, and the flow of
lava that has menaced Pahoa began bubbling out of the volcano's
Pu'u O'o vent on June 27. 

Lava from Kilauea destroyed more than
180 homes between 1983 and 1990, but until this week none had
been lost since 2012.
