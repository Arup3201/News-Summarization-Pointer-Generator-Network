It is the nation’s newest guessing game and has even sparked gambling fever: just who is the killer in new ITV series Broadchurch.

As armchair sleuths try to solve this murder mystery puzzle, no doubt the show’s cast will have some sympathy. Because even they didn’t know the answer until the very last minutes of filming.

Broadchurch tells the story of how a small community is affected by the death of a schoolboy whose body is found at the foot of a cliff.

The cast of Broadchurch, starring David Tennant, were not told the culprit until the last moments of filming

It stars former Doctor Who David Tennant, Olivia Colman – who played Carol Thatcher in the film The Iron Lady – and Pauline Quirke from Birds Of A Feather.

Writer Chris Chibnall was so determined to keep the climax a surprise that he kept his cast and crew in the dark for the whole of the five-month filming schedule – prompting a wild guessing game among them.

Chibnall said: ‘We adopted the kind of security you’d normally associate with a massive Hollywood movie. All of the scripts on set were kept  in a safe, watermarked so they couldn’t be copied, and there were only five people, including myself, who knew the full story.

‘For 85 per cent of filming, no  one had any idea who was guilty. The cast and crew set up a rogues’ gallery and took bets on who they thought it was, but I was determined that secrecy was the key to the drama’s success.’

Finally revealing the answer to ‘whodunit?’ became a mini drama on its own.

Chibnall, who also wrote the BBC hit Life On Mars, said: ‘As we were coming to the point where we had to give people final scripts, I organised for everyone to meet at the beach so that I could tell them.

The first episode of Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, attracted seven million viewers

‘But on set the night before, so many people admitted they liked the suspense and didn’t want to know who it was, that when I arrived I told them I’d changed my mind.

‘Olivia Colman, who plays one of the investigating police officers, looked like she was ready to murder me, while David Tennant grabbed hold of me and said he couldn’t believe I wasn’t going to tell him. But then he admitted he was actually glad.’

The actors were told on a ‘need-to-know’ basis a couple of days later in late-night phone calls just hours before they were due on set.

Attempts to keep the plot shrouded in secrecy are continuing, with the series, which started on Monday, due to run for another seven episodes.

Chibnall said: ‘Pauline Quirke called to say all her friends and  family are putting bets on, and I’ve heard countless similar stories in the past few days.

‘It seems people have become instantly caught up in the series.’

All preview copies of the series have been password-protected, with only a handful of people allowed access to them. Even ITV’s director of programmes, Peter Fincham, was kept in the dark until last week.

Writer Chris Chibnall gathered cast on a beach to tell them the plot, but then changed his mind at the last minute

Chibnall said: ‘We aren’t even allowing the following week’s episode to be trailed at the end of the show because it might lead  to the secret being blown.’

The series attracted more than seven million viewers for the first episode last week.

Now it looks set to win accolades as one of this year’s top dramas.  The story, set around the fictional Dorset town of Broadchurch, was filmed in the county at picturesque West Bay near Bridport.

Broadchurch is on ITV1 tomorrow at 9pm.

The West Bay in Dorset was used for the cult BBC sitcom The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin, starring the late Leonard Rossiter

The seaside town of West Bay in Dorset, where Broadchurch was filmed, has been the backdrop to  a string of TV dramas.

It earned its claim to fame in the Seventies when used for the faked 
suicide scenes in the opening titles of cult BBC sitcom The Fall And 
Rise Of Reginald Perrin, starring the late Leonard Rossiter.

Then, in 
1999, the bay landed a more regular TV slot  when it became Bridehaven 
in another BBC series, Harbour Lights, starring one-time heart-throb 
Nick Berry as a harbour master.

In real life, the bay is a favourite  for family holidays with amusement
 arcades, ice-cream shops and a funfair.

But the rugged cliffs and 
thrashing seas are a reminder that the coastline has a more dangerous 
side.

Last year, 22-year-old Charlotte Blackman was killed by a rockfall
 as she walked on the sands at nearby Burton Bradstock.

Some locals 
felt it was insensitive to use the coastline to film another tragedy, 
albeit fictional, so soon after her death.

ITV said it had consulted with the community before filming.
