Lionel Messi and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho would not have a problem working together, according to Manchester United star Angel di Maria.

Messi has been continually linked with a move away from Barcelona after rumours of a rift with boss Luis Enrique, but despite hearsay of a possible move to Chelsea among others, Di Maria expects the 27-year-old to stay put in the Catalonian capital.

However, the former Real Madrid winger, who worked under Mourinho at the Santiago Bernabeu, was confident that compatriot and fellow Argentina international Messi would fit in well if he were ever to switch the Nou Camp for Stamford Bridge.

'In principle, I don’t think Leo wants to leave Barcelona. It’s hard to walk away from a club that’s given you everything, where you effectively grew up. 

'But  no I don’t think he’d have any problem working with Mourinho,' he said.

After Manchester United's frustrated performance against West Ham on Sunday, boss Louis van Gaal was widely criticised for not utilising Di Maria to his full potential as a pacy wide man.

But the 26-year-old admitted he is enjoying his time in England since he made his £60million move from Madrid to Old Trafford.

'The weather is the only thing [I don't like]… it doesn’t help a lot. But I’m very content here. 

'The people have a lot of affection for me, which is the most important thing. It’s what I value most, and I have that here'.

When quizzed about his progress in learning English, the Rosario-born winger spoke with slightly less optimism.  

'It’s very bad. [I’ve learned] very little and only understand a small bit. That said, I’m trying to learn it bit by bit and I’m taking classes. Hopefully I’ll pick it up quickly,' he admitted.

Unperturbed by the prospect of sounding  like a broken record, the Argentine was asked if he minded having to make constant comparisons of Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the latter with whom he played alongside in the whites of Real.

'No, because I always say the same thing: that they're two completely different players,' he remarked.

'Leo features in every game, making short bursts and nonchalantly dribbling past one, two or three players with great ball control in tight spaces. Cristiano is more about power and long range shots. They're different.

'If I were FIFA, I'd have two Ballon d'Or prizes; one for that pair to fight over and another for everyone else.'
