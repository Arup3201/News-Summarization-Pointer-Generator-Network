In court: Emma West has pleaded guilty to a racially aggravated public order offence after ranting racist comments on a tram in November 2011

The woman whose racist rant at fellow tram passengers horrified millions on YouTube has finally, after more than 18 months, admitted her guilt.

Mother-of-two Emma West, 34, was secretly filmed by a passenger on a mobile phone and the clip, entitled My Tram Experience, was posted online in November 2011.

West, a former dental nurse from New Addington, Croydon, south London, was charged days later with a racially aggravated section 4 public order offence.

It can now also be revealed that West pleaded guilty last month to stabbing and slashing her partner 
Ricky Metson with an ornamental knife and assaulting a police 
officer.

On Monday, after a
 string of adjournments in which her lawyers claimed her mental health 
problems meant she was not fit to stand trial, West finally pleaded 
guilty to the racist rant.

She admitted the lesser 
charge of a racially aggravated section 5 public order offence - using 
threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly 
behaviour that is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress when she
 appeared at Croydon Crown Court.

She will be sentenced jointly for the tram rant and the attacks on her partner and a police officer on June 24.

More than 2.2m people viewed the clip
 of her vile abuse within 24 hours of it being posted online and 88,000 
members of the public commented on the footage.

West, with a toddler on her knee, shouted: 'What has this country come to? A load of black people and a load of f***ing Polish.

'You ain’t English. No, you ain’t English either. You ain’t English. None of you’s f***ing English.“It’s nothing now. Britain is nothing now. My Britain is f*** all now.'

Others posted links to the video on 
their social networking accounts and the film inspired a number of other
 people to record other racist behaviour on public transport.

Details can now be reported of how West attacked her partner of 12 years.

She had enjoyed a family day out and was
 dancing in the living room when she snapped during a conversation about
 her brother and started punching and slapping Mr Metson, Croydon 
Magistrates’ Court was told.

Remi Ogunfowora, prosecuting, said: 
'Mr Metson put his hands up in front of him to protect himself and told 
her to calm down.

'She said she was going to call her mum and ran 
upstairs and Mr Metson followed.

'As
 he entered the room she picked up an ornamental knife from its sheath, 
struck him in the head and started slashing at his body.

'He slapped her 
around the face in self-defence to try and calm her down and went 
downstairs.

'She followed 
him down the stairs and stabbed him in the back at least twice.

'She 
tried to run out the house and he stopped her leaving and called the 
police.'

Croydon 
Magistrates’ Court heard when police arrived they found Mr Metson, who 
was only wearing a pair of shorts covered in blood.

Officers recovered a
 knife from the property that was about six to eight inches long.

Ms Ogunfowora said: 'Mr Metson suffered 
two puncture wounds on his back and various slash and scratch wounds 
over his stomach, head, back of his neck, arms and legs.

'When officers tried to arrest Miss West she started to kick them.'

Mr Metson is standing by West after her attack on him and was with her at court on Monday.

The tram rant case and the assault cases were adjourned until June 24 pending pre-sentence reports.

Recorder of Croydon Judge Warwick Mckinnon indicated he would pass a community sentence for the three offences and will not face jail.
