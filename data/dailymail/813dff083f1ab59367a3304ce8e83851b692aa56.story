Father, forgive him, for he has sinned.

A Los Angeles man has been accused of taking nude photographs of women – some of them minors – all in the name of religion.

Efrain Bernal allegedly told the girls that the photographs were part of a ‘religious ceremony.’

House of horror: Police discovered the photos at Bernal's Hemet, California home

It was also revealed that the 41-year-old East Hemet resident had been abusing an adult female member of the household for ten years, investigators said.

‘I always had a feeling something was off about him, but I just kinda pushed it in the back of my head, because it’s not something you want to believe about your father,’ his daughter Destiny Audish told cbslosangeles.com.

Riverside County Sheriff’s deputies went to the house Wednesday after receiving a call about inappropriate photos being taken of young girls.

According to CBS Los Angeles, police recovered explicit photos of girls under the age of 18 at Bernal’s home.

They believe the photos were taken by him.

Sgt Joe Borja told KABC that the photos were explicit.

‘I don’t know if they were completely disrobed, but they were nude and they’re considered explicit photos,’ he told the station.

Ms Audish said that her father conducted Bible studies at their home, and she began to get uncomfortable with the level of familiarity he displayed with the girls.

‘He would use God as a way for them to just wanna trust him, to believe him,’ she told CBS Los Angeles.

Authorities did not go into details of Bernal’s self-proclaimed ‘religious ceremony.’

He was charged with four felony counts of misconduct with a child and is held at the Southwest Valley Detention Centre on $1million bail.

Though Ms Audish said she is appalled by her father’s behaviour, she said the woman who was abused for ten years is ‘okay now.’

He is scheduled to appear in court today.
