An unemployed graduate claims she was stripped of her unemployment benefits because she attended a job interview.

Ceri Padley had been receiving Jobseekers' Allowance since returning from 18 months travelling around the world.

As part of the process, the 26-year-old was required to attend her local Job Centre to receive advice on how to find work and to qualify for the £71.70-a-week payment.

And when the qualified teacher heard she had a second-stage interview for a job at a school which clashed with one of the twice monthly appointment, she assumed she could count of the full support of Job Centre staff.

But she claims that despite attending a rescheduled meeting to sign-on the following day, she was stripped of her benefits.

An official letter, posted on her blog, says that the decision to dock a month's worth of payments - a total of £286.80 - was because attending a job interview was not a 'sufficiently' good enough reason for not attending her long-standing appointment.

Ceri, from Port Talbot, South Wales, 
said: 'Going to a job interview is not good enough reason to miss a signing-on appointment.

The clash occurred when the teaching 
interview fell on June 5 - at exactly the time she was meant to see the 
Job Centre adviser.

But having agreed that she could come in the 
following day, she was told she had breach the rules and would forfeit 
her benefits.

She added: 'I could completely understand their reasons if I hadn’t told them I had 
an interview and just missed signing-on without warning anyone.

'I can also understand their reasons for looking at the time my job 
interview finished (1.00pm) and thinking, “Hmmm, she can probably make 
it back from Cardiff and sign on on time at 2.30pm”.

'But they told me NOT to come in on my regular signing-on day and to go in the following day for my new scheduled appointment.

'Not only that, but I’ve been sanctioned and left without money for a month. A whole month.

'Never mind the fact that I have job interviews coming up and no way of 
getting to them now. Never mind the fact that my phone is due to go out 
of service from lack of payment and every employer who has my CV has no 
way of contacting me.'

She added: 'I must be punished. I have been too productive with my time in 
trying to get employed and, as a result, I must learn what life without 
money is really like.

Ceri,
 who has eight years experience in customer services, call centres and 
retail, is so desperate to get back into work she is applying for 
everything she can.'

She is considering leaving the country in order to find work but needs to save the money for a plane ticket.

A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said they cannot comment on individual cases.
