Millions of diners are too scared to eat oysters and prefer to eat fish fingers, rather than tucking into fish with eyes, a new study has revealed.

Although cookery programmes are among the most popular shows on television, it seems that when it comes to adventurous eating it seems many of us have a long way to go.

In fact, one in five adults are so put off by fish that they would only eat them if they were coated in breadcrumbs and shaped into 'fingers'.

Phobia: Oysters have come top of a list of the nation's 10 most-feared foods, with a third of people refusing to eat them

The survey, carried out by restaurant chain Loch Fyne found that seafood was among the UK's most feared foods, with oysters coming out on top as a third of people refuse to eat them and one in 10 will not eat any fish whatsoever.

Fish with eyes came second in the poll and anchovies were fifth, while shellfish and fish on the bone took up places eight and nine.

Only offal and meat cooked rare managed to break the underwater monopoly on the top five spots, while blue cheese, liver and gherkins also appeared in the top 10.

Experts say many food phobics are put off by the smell, look and texture of fish and seafood.

Food psychologist Dr Christy Fergusson said that many people were averse to eating fish because of a subconscious association with it.

'Perhaps the look of the whole fish with the eyes on the plate freaked them out as a child. Maybe the texture of seafood reminds them of something unpleasant,' she told the Mirror.

Dr Fergusson said that some fussy eaters even chose to stay well clear of more popular foods, such as cottage cheese and baked beans - while the survey found that some people could not even bring themselves to eat chocolate or bagels.

She added: 'One reason to explain this could be that as a child they experienced some form of stress or anxiety while eating the food or the texture or feel of the food reminded them of something unpleasant.'
