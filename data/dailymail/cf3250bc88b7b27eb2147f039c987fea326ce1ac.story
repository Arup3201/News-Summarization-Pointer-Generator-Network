British interests: David Cameron has threatened to use veto

Prime Minister David Cameron today vowed to stick to his guns in demanding a European budget freeze, declaring: 'We've not put in place tough settlements
 in Britain in order to go to Brussels and sign up to big increases in 
European spending.'

He made his position clear in the House of Commons hours after Germany denied seeking to cancel 
next month's European Council summit if the UK threatened to 
veto any rise in the EU budget.

But speaking to MPs today, Mr Cameron insisted he had 'put down a marker' that he wanted to see a 'rigorous' settlement.

And he insisted neither Britain or Germany was prepared to back further big rises in spending.

'I don't believe that German voters want that any more than British voters, and that's why our governments have led the argument in Europe for fiscal restraint,' he said.

Mr Cameron said on Friday that he would not sign up to an agreement on the long-term EU budget for 2014/20 if it amounted to a 'bad deal' for Britain, sparking speculation that the negotiations may run into the sand.

The Financial Times said German chancellor Angela Merkel was planning to warn Downing Street that she will have the November summit called off unless he is ready to show flexibility.

But Mrs Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert today told a news conference: 'It is not true. I categorically deny this report.

'The German government has an interest in the success of this special summit in November and supports European Council president Herman van Rompuy in the goal to get an agreement on the long-term 2014-2020 budget.'

Mrs Merkel is trying to persuade Mr Cameron to accept a German compromise which would cap EU spending at 1 per cent of European GDP, rather than the 1.1 per cent proposed by the European Commission.

But the Prime Minister has made clear he does not see any case for a rise above inflation.

It was reported that the German chancellor would use a visit to Downing Street early next month to tell Mr Cameron that there was no point in holding a summit if he insists on a veto.

Clash: German Chancellor Angela Merkel

Mr Cameron's official spokesman said that the Government had received no communication from Berlin over any proposal to cancel the November 22 summit at which it is hoped to reach agreement on the budget.

The PM's spokesman told reporters at a
 regular Westminster media briefing: 'The Prime Minister has made it 
clear that he is willing to do a deal on the budget in November, so long
 as that is the right deal for British taxpayers.

'We have said that we don't see a case for increases in spending above the rate of inflation.

'Countries
 around the EU are having to take some very tough decisions on spending.
 The level of public debt across the EU in 2012 is 50 per cent more than
 it was in 2007.

'On average, countries are expecting spending as a percentage of GDP to fall by 8 per cent between 2010 and 2014.

'This
 is a time when many countries are having to take some very difficult 
decisions and that should be reflected in the discussions we are having 
in the EU on the budget.'

Wrangling
 over the EU budget is likely to dominate talks which Mr Cameron will 
have with Mr van Rompuy at 10 Downing Street on Thursday.

Mr
 Cameron set out his position at a Brussels press conference last 
Friday. 'It just would not be acceptable to see a huge increase in EU 
spending at a time when other budgets are being cut,' he said.

'If there isn't a deal that is good for Britain, if there isn't a deal available then there won't be a deal.

'We
 cannot have European spending going up and up and up when we are having
 to make difficult decisions in so many different areas.'

The euro zone's fiscal deficit fell sharply last year as governments slashed expenses and raised taxes, but public debt still climbed, the European Union's statistics office revealed today.

Fiscal or budget deficit is the amount governments must borrow to make up any shortfall in their budgets. Public debt is recorded as a percentage of its Gross Domestic Product - the value of all the goods and services produced by a country.

Eurostat said the budget deficit in the 17 countries using the euro fell to 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product in 2011 from 6.2 per cent in 2010 - the first year of the debt crisis.

Euro zone public debt, however, rose to 87.3 per cent of GDP in 2011 from 85.4 per cent, Eurostat said.

The euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, slashed its budget deficit to 0.8 per cent in 2011 from 4.1 per cent in 2010 and its debt fell to 80.5 per cent of GDP from 82.5 per cent.

Ireland reported a spectacular drop in the deficit to 13.4 per cent from 30.9 per cent as the one-off expense of shoring up its banking sector disappeared from its books. But its debt jumped to 106.4 per cent from 92.2 per cent.

Greece, where the crisis started, had the highest debt in Europe last year, reaching 170.6 per cent of GDP even though it reduced its deficit to 9.4 per cent from 10.7 per cent in 2010 and 15.6 per cent in 2009.

Spain reduced its budget deficit only marginally to 9.4 per cent in 2011 from 9.7 per cent in 2010. The 2011 figure is 0.9 percentage points higher than previously reported.

But Spain's debt was still relatively low, at 69.3 per cent of GDP against 61.5 per cent in 2010.

Italy, also under market scrutiny cut its budget shortfall to 3.9 per cent from 4.5 per cent in 2010. Its debt inched higher to 120.7 per cent from 119.2 per cent.

Portugal, already on a euro zone financial lifeline after being cut off from market borrowing, more than halved its budget deficit last year to 4.4 per cent of GDP from 9.8 per cent as a result of reforms, but its debt jumped to 108.1 per cent from 93.5 per cent.
