Flash floods devastated large areas of Britain today as torrential rain damaged houses, overwhelmed rail stations and stranded residents in their homes.

The flooding was several feet deep at points and Essex firefighters rescued locals from neighbouring houses, while a road collapsed under the rainfall.

In Brighton a lightning strike threw rail services into chaos when it struck an electricity sub-station, cutting power to coastal routes.

Commuters also struggled through a storm in the East Sussex seaside town which was described as like a 'zombie apocalypse'.

But most of Britain is set for reasonable weather for the next few days with low to mid-20 temperatures before rain returns to the North later in the week.

The resident was evacuated to a nearby town hall while firefighters attempted to clean up the mess - it was just one of 50 houses affected by flood water in the area.

The thunderstorms stretched emergency services - East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said nearly 300 calls were received within a few hours this morning and a further 60 calls had to be passed to colleagues in Cambridgeshire as the storms swept in.

The fierce storms also extended further north to Thaxted, Essex, where firefighters rescued five people from three neighbouring houses which had flooded.

One family remained on the first floor of their home while crews pumped water from the property after flood water affected the electrics.

Commuters posted on Twitter descriptions of heavy hail and localised flooding caused by the storms. Local residents said the storm started at 5.30am, leading to torrential rain.

Brighton station tweeted the downpour at the stations was like a 'zombie apocalypse'.

The weather forecast shows today's thunderstorms in the southeast will not continue tomorrow. However, cloud and rain is expected to return later in the week

The Met Office has activated a yellow 'be aware' warning for the rainfall and thunderstorms in the area, which finishes at 11.45pm tonight.

'Heavy thundery showers are expected 
across parts of East Anglia and southeast England, including the London 
area, at times on Monday. Isolated thundery downpours are now developing
 over East Anglia, extending further north into Norfolk.

The Met Office said 43mm of rain fell in an hour in Great Dunmow, Suffolk, between 4am and 5am.

Meanwhile, 37mm of rain was recorded in an hour in Isfield, Sussex, while 35mm fell in Ardingly, Sussex.

In Northolt, north-west London, 43.4mm of rain fell over a three-hour period this morning and in Santon Downham, Suffolk, 51.2mm of rain was recorded from 3am to 9am.

'These will become more widespread across East Anglia and southeast England by morning, dying out for a time later in the morning, before further isolated heavy showers and thunderstorms develop again in the afternoon.

'There is also a risk of heavy rain affecting the far southeast at times later today and into Monday night.'

Meanwhile, a spokesman said 'very heavy' rainfall in Northolt, north-west London, had seen 1.7in (43mm) fall within three hours.

'The weather front is slowly dissipating and will move south and is weakening.

'It's just restricted to the southeast area. That warning is in place until quarter to midnight tonight so that area is at risk of that heavy rainfall.'

Sussex Police warned drivers to be careful as the flash flooding hit Worthing, West Sussex, and Portslade and Mile Oak on the outskirts of Brighton and Hove.

Southern Water said it was doing all it could to help customers affected by the sewer network being overwhelmed. The AA said it attended 34 flood-related call outs, mostly around west London and West Sussex.

Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'Although the flash flooding was forecast, it's more difficult to predict the actual impact on the ground and unfortunately some people this morning found out the hard way that drains struggle to cope with such large deluges.

'Don't risk driving down a flooded road as just a tiny amount of water can wreck your engine - three-quarters of flood-damaged cars are written off. It's far better to turn round and find an alternative route.'

Firemen spent the morning trying desperately to pump away the water flooding Brighton's roads today - even as the rain continued to fall

Calm before the storm: The hail and thunderstorms enveloping Brighton in the early hours of the morning - with them came travel chaos and rail service disruptions

A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said: 'Due to heavy rain and storms this morning parts of the city are experiencing flooding. Essential services are being maintained. The drains will start to carry away the water once the rain subsides.

'City
 clean is working with East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service to clear 
roadside gullies. The refuse and recycling service is operating normally
 but might be a bit slower due to the weather.

'Council
 staff are advised that Kings House is closed due to flooding in the 
basement which is threatening some of the main electrical panels. Immediate work is under way to clear the water safely and isolate the electrics.'

Areas of Essex and also Ruislip to the northwest were caught in the thunderstorms which appeared to avoid central London.

Twenty houses were affected by flood water in Ruislip, while up to 1ft of water flooded a ground floor flat in Northolt Road, Harrow.

Essex Fire and Rescue Service said it had dealt with 20 incidents in Thaxted following flash flooding - this included rescuing five people from three neighbouring houses, while a road in the town collapsed from the heavy rainfall.

The famous Brighton Pier today looked vastly different from last week when it was basking in warm temperatures and thousands of people were on the beach

Brighton Beach was deserted today as rain and hail lashed the region, stranding residents in their own homes and throwing public transport services into disarray

The worst of the rainfall hit Brighton Pier - pictured this morning during the worst of the storm - before slowly making its way southeast across the channel

Sean Penston, Meteogroup forecaster 
said there were 'intense' showers across southeast England, with 47.7mm 
of rainfall recorded in three hours in Suffolk.

'That's fairly torrential bursts of rain,
 there's also frequent lightning going off in a line from London to 
Brighton - there's some pretty active thunderstorms.'

Thunderstorms also hit Buckinghamshire, with Beaconsfield suffering flash floods that turned roads into rivers.

However, it is not likely to hang around.

Mr Penston added: 'Tomorrow will be a fine day actually 
across the southeast. There should be plenty of sunshine and quite warm weather. It
 should be fine as well Thursday - I think it's maybe Friday when you see 
rain pushing in across the northwest.'Â 

Remarkably, it was sunbathing weather at Tynemouth Beach today, where temperatures reached 20C while the south suffered flooding and thunderstorms

It was also warm enough for the beach at New Brighton to fill up today with sunbathers and kids playing in the sand during their school holidays

Meanwhile, as many in south-east 
Britain struggled with the heavy rains and thunderstorms, many living 
further north could be seen sunbathing on beaches in reasonably warm 
weather.

Many areas across Britain today enjoyed comfortable temperatures in the 20 to 22C range.

Local
 temperatures in the West Midlands and Thames Valley could reach 24C, 
however, in the far west of Scotland and Northern Ireland a westerly 
breeze would dampen those highs and it will be 17 to 20C.

Mr
 Penston said tomorrow it would be warm in the South East, with temperatures 
of 24 to 26C, but steadily getting cooler across the North West in a 
'divide' between the North East and South West.
