Tory MPs have begun canvassing each other over whether David Cameron should be sacked if Scotland votes for independence, it has emerged.

Over the weekend, the influential 1922 Committee representing backbench Conservative MPs contacted MPs to ask whether Mr Cameron could stay in his job in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote.

The Prime Minister has insisted he would ‘emphatically’ not resign if he lost Scotland. The Chancellor George Osborne has also dismissed the suggestion that Mr Cameron’s position would be in question in the event of separation.

But Mr Cameron may face an immediate vote of no confidence and a leadership challenge. Labour leader Ed Miliband would also be under pressure having lost a key heartland – and more than 40 MPs.

A yes vote on Scottish independence will plunge David Cameron  into a leadership crisis that could force him to quit

Under Tory Party rules, a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron would be triggered if at least 15 per cent of the party’s MPs write to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee requesting one. Some 46 MPs would have to write letters to trigger a vote.

‘The move will take place immediately,’ said one senior Tory MP told the Financial Times. ‘David Cameron will be unable to contain the anger at the humiliation. His position will be terminal.’

Some Tory MPs claim Mr Cameron gave too much ground to Alex Salmond in negotiations over the referendum.

The PM is accused by some of mistakenly agreeing to the Scottish referendum’s timing and the wording of the question on the ballot paper. 

But Downing Street sources have insisted the SNP was elected with a clear majority in the Scottish parliament and had said it would hold a referendum.

After this it would have been ‘unthinkable’ for Mr Cameron to have told the people of Scotland they could not have a referendum, they said.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Tory foreign secretary, claimed the real blame for losing Scotland would fall on Labour.

He said Tory supporters were solidly behind the No campaign while polls show up to 35 per cent of Labour voters could vote Yes.

Sir Malcolm said: ‘I think that up until now he’s done all he could have done and was advised to do. You can hardly blame the prime minister for Labour people deserting their own party.’

Yesterday, there were claims that at least two ministers in the Government would feel bound to resign if the Scots vote yes – a move that would pile pressure on the Prime Minister. 

Some MPs who are plotting against Mr Cameron’s leadership are also understood to have discussed the possibility of mounting a challenge to him in the event of a Yes vote. 

One former minister said: ‘It will be a cataclysm that will eclipse everything else for years to come and it is very hard to see how Cameron could survive it.’

Last month the former Tory leadership contender, David Davis, said Mr Cameron said Mr Cameron would be ‘humiliated’ if Scotland voted to leave the UK.

The Prime Minister is planning one more visit to Scotland between now and polling day on September 18. It will be dominated by a commitment to give more powers to the Scots if they vote no and an ‘emotional’ case for the continuation of the Union. 

Will Hutton, an economist and former government adviser, said: ‘Both party leaders are in a lot of trouble. The shockwaves from this will go through every institution in the country.’
