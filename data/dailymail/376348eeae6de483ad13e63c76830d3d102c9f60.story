A woman has been banned from keeping pets for 15 years after her cats were found in what RSPCA inspectors called 'the worst conditions they had seen'.

Janet Latheron, 60, from Atherton, near Wigan, kept her six cats in squalor, locked into a prison-like shed fitted with chicken wire dubbed Al-cat-traz by her neighbours.

Latheron, who lives alone, fed the cats which she had had since they were kittens, on chips and onion gravy which she bought from her local fish and chip shop with her disability payments.

When RSPCA inspectors raided her home after a tip-off, they found every surface of the shed including the window-sills caked in faeces, maggots and dead flies, while the cats huddled together on a fithy table.

And when they tried to pick up the cats, the animals were so frightened of being handled by humans that they tried to scratch their rescuers.

All had multiple chronic infections and are now in an RSPCA safehouse where they are recovering.

It is feared the cats may have been kept inside the shed for up to three years in what the animal welfare organisation called ‘some of the worst conditions they have ever seen.’

Details of the case emerged at Wigan Magistrates' Court, where prosecutor, Tony Stock, said: 'Initially the RSPCA had difficulty accessing the property or ramshackle shed in which the cats were housed.

'After a number of hours, and with assistance from the police, they entered the shed and the inspector was shocked by the conditions they found, stating they were "Some of the worst conditions they had seen cats kept in".

'The inspector could not stay very long inside as conditions were so bad.

'The vet who examined the cats said that he could not remember a single animal suffering from so many infections at the same time in all his 30 years as a vet,'

Mr Stock added: 'The vet noted that by nature cats are clean and meticulous animals and these cats were found living, breathing and walking in their own dirt.

'This has led to mental suffering in which they were frightened and confused.'

'Chips and onion gravy, their food, remained on the floor. The handover was only achieved with some difficulty because the cats were clearly not used to being handled. All six cats were found to be frightened.

Latheron, who later denied she had kept her cats in such an unsanitary environment, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to six cats.

In addition to the 15-year ban on keeping animals, which means Latheron will lose her pet bearded dragon which she kept inside her house, she was also given a curfew from 8pm until 7am for 16 weeks.

She was also ordered to pay costs of £500 and a victim surcharge of £60, and will not be able to appeal the ban on keeping all animals for 10 years.

Her lawyer, Bob Toppin, said: 'The defendant has swollen ankles and a bad hip and her mobility problems contributed to what happened.

'She has been in floods of tears and these are serious matters. She is a lady who is ashamed to find herself in court at this time in her life.'

But RSPCA Inspector Vicki McDonald, who attended the scene, said: 'I hope never to see animals kept in such appalling conditions again. I couldn’t stay in that shed for more than 10 minutes because the smell was so bad.'

She added: 'I am particularly pleased with the ban which will prevent the situation happening again and it goes to show keeping animals like this will not be tolerated and will be taken seriously by the courts.'
