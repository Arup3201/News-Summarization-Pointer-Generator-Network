Scots should raise their own taxes to pay for 40 per cent of all their spending, Gordon Brown said yesterday.

As he made a personal plea for the Union between Scotland and the rest of the UK to remain, the former Prime Minister backed calls for more powers to be devolved north of the border.

Mr Brown, who has maintained a low profile since the 2010 election, said that Westminster should arrange a power-sharing arrangement with Edinburgh.

The Scottish Parliament should get new
 tax-raising powers to create a ‘partnership of equals’ between Scotland
 and the United Kingdom, and Holyrood should raise 40 per cent of the 
cash it spends on devolved policies, Mr Brown said.

He
 also set out a six-point plan to devolve more powers to Edinburgh, 
including a guarantee that the Scottish Parliament was here to stay and 
did not exist at the ‘whim’ of Westminster.

Other
 proposals include giving Holyrood more powers over employment, health, 
transport and economic regeneration; new power-sharing partnerships to 
tackle poverty, unemployment, housing need and the environment and a 
‘radical’ transfer of powers from Westminster and Edinburgh to local 
communities.

The Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath MP said Scots had to work with the rest of the UK for the common good

Scotland is due
 to get new powers over income tax from April 2016, when the UK Treasury
 will deduct 10p from standard and upper rates of income tax in Scotland
 and give MSPs the power to decide how to raise cash.

Mr
 Brown went further than this, though, saying: ‘The first 5p of income 
tax should be decided by the UK government, the next 15p by the Scottish
 government.

‘I believe that
 is a fair way of raising 40 per cent of the revenue of the Scottish 
Parliament in Scotland.’

Mr Brown was outlining his vision for life in Scotland in the case of people voting against independence

This would make Scottish politicians 
‘accountable to the people of Scotland for the way that money is spent’.

Mr
 Brown also suggested the Scottish Parliament should have powers to 
change the top rate of income tax, saying: ‘If the fairness of the 
Scottish Parliament was being undermined by unfairness elsewhere then 
there should be power to do something about it.’

But
 Blair Jenkins, from the pro-separation group Yes Scotland, said: ‘A Yes
 vote is the only way to ensure Scotland is in charge of its own broad 
tax base, and that decisions on welfare and pensions reflect Scotland’s 
wishes.’

Mr Brown has submitted his proposals to 
Labour's devolution commission, which will shortly put forward plans to 
boost devolution in the event of a No vote in September's Scottish 
independence referendum.

He
 spoke out at the same time as former Liberal Democrat leader Sir 
Menzies Campbell said political parties should meet within 30 days of a 
No vote in the independence referendum to agree further powers for 
Scotland.

Menzies Campbell said that if Scotland votes No, political parties should agree further powers for Scotland
