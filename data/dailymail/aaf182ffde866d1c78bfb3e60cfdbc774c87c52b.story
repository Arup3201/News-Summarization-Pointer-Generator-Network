The wedding party was almost ready to set off. I took a deep breath, smoothed my ivory lace gown one last time and glanced around me.

My bridegroom Cornel looked handsome and dashing in his morning suit, his lilac cravat toning beautifully with the flowers in my bouquet.

Our little boy Alex, then 11 months old, toddled behind me, so cute in his tiny suit he was almost edible — a perfect miniature of his father in every way.

Overprotective: First-time mum Julie Cook was so worried that her toddler Alex would hurt himself that she bought him a crash helmet, and even dressed the tot in the safety gear for her wedding

Every way, but one. On my son’s head sat an ugly brown helmet, fastened tightly under his chin, and Cornel had just spotted it.

‘Oh no, Julie — not today,’ he sighed, rolling his eyes. ‘What about the photos? The guests will think we’re mad!’

‘The town hall is huge,’ I protested, ‘and it’s full of sharp edges and polished floors. What if he hits his head?’

Eventually, as my chief bridesmaid muttered about the time, a compromise was negotiated. I would agree to remove the helmet if Alex could remain strapped into his buggy throughout the ceremony. But at the hotel, where the reception was taking place, it would go back on — and stay on.

Safety fears: Julie bought Alex the helmet when he was around nine-months-old

It’s not as if Alex wasn’t used to it. He
wasn’t even a year old, yet he had become accustomed to living in an 
environment created for him by the world’s most over-protective mother.

Looking back, I was always rather 
anxious, but that’s normal for first-time mums. It wasn’t until Alex 
became mobile that my parental paranoia really kicked in. He crawled 
quite early; he was barely seven months old. But the sight of my baby 
gleefully propelling himself across the floor of our front room made me 
feel quite ill.

My heart hammered in my chest. Beads of cold sweat prickled the back of my neck. I knew straight away that it was a strange reaction, so I took deep breaths and told myself that learning to crawl was a perfectly normal development; something to be celebrated — another milestone passed in a child’s necessary exploration of the world around him.

So why, when other mothers might reach for their cameras, was I fighting the temptation to confine my boy in a playpen or a buggy? Why, when most women would actively encourage their infants, did I long to hold my child back?

I suspect the answers to those questions can be found in events that took place long before my son was even born.

Alex was the happy result of my third pregnancy. Before he arrived to make our dreams come true, I suffered two miscarriages.

I lost my first baby at nine weeks and the second one at six weeks. And all the time I was expecting Alex, I continued to show symptoms that indicated I might miscarry again.

So that whole pregnancy was spent in fear. From the very day I discovered I was having Alex, I became convinced I was about to lose him, too.

That he was eventually born safely was as much a surprise to me as a joy. When I finally accepted he was here — alive and healthy — the fear that he would share the fate of my first two babies was replaced by another fear. Suddenly, the world around me seemed unsafe.

Secret purchase: Julie bought the helmet from an online seller, without telling her husband Cornel, who joked that their son was about to start performing stunts

While he was tiny, I convinced myself that I could keep any threat to my precious child at bay with ceaseless vigilance.

But
as Alex grew and wanted to explore, our whole world, even our home, 
turned into a place full of dangers. It was all I could see. The edges 
of tables and drawers looked as sharp as blades. Short, out-of-reach 
blind cords, belts and bits of string were now strangulation hazards. 
Anything smaller than a tennis ball was a potential choking hazard. And 
heaven help any innocent men who smiled at my son in his pram. Potential
child abductors, all of them.

When
Alex started pulling himself upright, I began sticking big blobs of 
Blu-Tack on every sharp corner in our home in case his precious head 
should make contact with them. No table, dining chair or chest of 
drawers was safe from my paranoid attention.

I bought extra pillows and cushions, 
dozens of them, and placed them everywhere — against doors, skirting 
boards and cupboards. Our front room looked like the inside of a bedouin
tent, but still I couldn’t relax.

So I went online and researched safety equipment. When Alex was about nine months old I found a company which produced helmets for babies and toddlers, so I ordered one, without telling Cornel.

‘What the blazes is that?’ he asked the first time he saw his son in it.

‘It’s a crash hat,’ I said sheepishly.

Seeing sense: Julie soon realised that her little boy was itching to explore, without his protective headgear, and Cornel made her bin the helmet

‘For what,’ he demanded. ‘Is Alex going to start motorcycle stunts?’

But
I couldn’t be persuaded — or teased — into backing down. I thought the 
helmet was wonderful. I could cook, work, or do housework knowing Alex 
was safe. And I tried not to notice him tugging in irritation at the 
strap under his chin. I made my toddler wear it all the time at home, 
and obviously there was no way he would be allowed out of it at our 
wedding reception. And so, after we’d said our vows and moved on to the 
hotel, I buckled the helmet on to Alex’s head.

Every so often I’d notice friends throwing him puzzled looks.

‘Does he really need that, Julie?’ one asked.

‘Of
course!’ I hissed, almost offended. ‘There’s a massive glass vase over 
there. And look at the sharp corners on those shelves!’

Adventurous: Nearly four years on from his helmet-wearing days, Alex has grown into a fearless little boy

A few days later, when we posted our wedding photos online, questions began to flood in from friends who hadn’t been there.

‘I saw Alex wearing a helmet — is everything all right,’ asked one. ‘Has he got a head injury?’

Then another, an old childhood friend, asked more bluntly: ‘Why is that poor boy wearing that ridiculous hat?’

I
offered my usual explanation; that the world was a far too dangerous 
place to unleash a wobbly-legged toddler. ‘You can’t be serious,’ she 
told me. ‘Have you forgotten what a daredevil you used to be?’

Her
words stung. They brought back my own carefree childhood in the 
Eighties — the long summer holidays when my friends and I were allowed 
to play outside until all hours, revelling in our independence, never 
giving a thought to the bruises, bumps and splinters picked up along the
way.

I would roller-skate downhill at breakneck speed and on a bike I was a total menace.

I once went so fast that when I slammed on the brakes I catapulted myself head-first over a neighbour’s parked car.

I was none the worse for any of it, although I can’t speak for the car.

In fact, the freedom my parents gave me taught me to be self-reliant, not to whine about minor injuries and to puzzle out my problems for myself. It made me strong.

I gazed at my son sitting on the floor in the safety of his own home, wearing a crash hat, surrounded by cushions. His little face was full of the excitement and curiosity of a child aching to explore the world, and it broke my heart.

Was I protecting him — or smothering him?

My friends were right. Perhaps I needed to let go a little.

With great reluctance, I put the helmet in the wardrobe. Cornel raised an exasperated eyebrow and pointed to the bin.

So I threw it away.

Then
I picked off every piece of sticky Blu-Tack from the furniture and 
offered up a silent prayer that Alex wouldn’t knock himself out.

Over
the next few months, Alex fell over countless times. On one occasion he
fell on to the corner of my laptop and I rushed him to A&E. He 
didn’t even have a bruise.

Happy families: Julie says she has realised that being a good mother is not only about protecting your child, but equipping them to survive in the world, sharp corners and all

The doctors told me that babies were resilient and to go home. They were right: he was fine.

As
he grew, I lost count of the times he fell and cried; the times I had 
to put ‘magic cream’ on his bloodied knees. But as my husband says: 
‘This is what little boys do.’

Nearly
four years on, Alex has grown into a typically fearless little boy. He 
whizzes around on his bike like a miniature Bradley Wiggins, loves 
climbing trees and always seems to have rips in his trousers and scabs 
on his knees.

While I still 
feel that flutter of fear in my stomach when I see him career off on his
bike, I tell myself it is normal; that I have to watch quietly from the
sidelines, and that those minor injuries are just little markers of 
lessons learned on his journey to adulthood.

I
finally realised that being a good mother is not only about protecting 
your child, but equipping them to survive in the world — sharp corners 
and all.
