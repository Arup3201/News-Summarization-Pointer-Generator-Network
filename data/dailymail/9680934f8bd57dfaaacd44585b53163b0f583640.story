The collection of a lifetime of cars and vehicle memorabilia has sold at auction for £3million.

Michael Banfield, a founder member of the Historic Commercial Vehicle Society, spent more than 50 years collecting buses, emergency vehicles and cars.

His interest was sparked in 1959 when he bought his first classic car, a 1927 Bentley.

Michael Banfield with the Merryweather fire engine. The company Merryweather was founded in the 19th Century and is still family owned. The founder was Moses Merryweather (1791-1872) of Clapham, who was joined by his son Richard Moses (1839-1877). Appliances were available in small sizes suitable for a country house, pumping about 100 gallons per minute, through to large dockyard models, that could eject 2,000 gallons per minute.

The same 1913 Merryweather fire engine as it appears today. The company that made it still exists and is based in Tuesnoad Grange, a Grade II. listed, 15th Century Elizabethean Yeoman's House at Tuesnoad, Kent.

Over the next 50 years, the collection encompassed dozens of cars and more than 1,200 items of automobilia.

Mr Banfield, from Staplehurst, Kent, died last year and his family sold his collection in a special auction with Bonhams.

It included a 1914 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost which sold for £418,140 and a trio of buses sold for in excess of £500,000.

This included a 1922 AEC S-Type open-top double-deck bus which sold for a world record £281,500 - three times more than expected.

A collection of fire engines further heated up the bidding, with a 1913 Merryweather Fire Engine selling for £74,300, and a 1910 Delahaye Fire Engine chassis selling at £13,225, more than doubling its top estimate.

The final total was more than £3m and 99.7 per cent of the lots were sold.

Malcolm Barber, Bonhams co-chairman and auctioneer at the sale, said: ‘For more than 50 years Michael Banfield dedicated himself to the restoration and preservation of these fantastic vehicles. 

‘I’m delighted we were able to celebrate Michael and his collection with the weekend’s event, honouring his life’s passion with his friends, family, and automotive enthusiasts.

‘Bidders came from all over the world including several from the southern hemisphere, with clients from both Australia and New Zealand not only bidding in the room, but also watching via Bonhams online bidding platform.

‘Customers registered from Japan, the Mid-West of America, Miami, across Europe and even Hong Kong - this was a highly sought after collection with many of Bonhams international clients taking an intense interest.’

After founding the Historic Commercial Vehicle Society, Michael Banfield became chairman in 1965, a role he remained in until 1993 when the society became a charity.

He then stayed on as CEO until his retirement in 2011. His efforts were rewarded when, in 2007, he was made an Honorary Life President of the VCC and was given a Lifetime achievement award by the Transport Trust.

All aboard, plenty of room on top: This is a 1922 AEC S-Type open top double decker bus. This bus was built between 1920 and 1927. This particular vehicle went into service on October 2, 1922 with the Metropolitan Stage Carriage plate No 2635. Among the routes that it plied from Nunhead Lane was No 12, which ran from The Plough at Dulwich to the Princess Victoria at Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's Bush, a journey of 13.3-miles for which the full fare was 8d (3.5p). Its driver would have been paid £4 a week, his conductor £3 15s (£3.75)

The AECS Type bus in the late 1960s. When it was auctioned at Bonhams it went for £281,500

A 1915 Peerless TC4 open back lorry.  In 1914 the British Government hired Gaston, Williams & Wigmore to supply American chassis to be fitted with bodies in England. A leading supplier was Peerless of Cleveland, Ohio, a firm that began when Queen Victoria was on the throne and started off making mangles before turning to bicycle manufacture. From 1915 until 1918 the Government bought 12,000 Peerless truck chassis, which were imported via Liverpool. This lorry sold for £42,550.

Pierce-Arrow R8 open back lorry. Like its contemporary Peerless, Pierce-Arrow of Buffalo, New York, who made this lorry, began by manufacturing domestic items. In the case of Pierce-Arrow they made fridges and birdcage. They started making lorries in June 1911 and this R8, which is dated 1917 by the Veteran Car Club, was bought by Michael Banfield in June 1973.

This 1929 Chevrolet LQ International 14-seater coach was manufactured at the General Motors factory at Hendon. The bus was the forerunner of the Bedford commercial vehicle range and was powered by a six-cylinder 2.9-litre petrol engine with overhead valves. It has a four-speed gearbox and sold for £40,250

1922 Tilling Stevens double deciker bus. The company behind the bus was founded in 1847 by Thomas Tilling and started a horse-drawn omnibus service three years later. By 1897 the company had 4,000 horses. Tilling¿s is thought to have been the first company to run a regular service over a regular route. They bought the first electric buses in 1904 and by 1921 they had a fleet of 150 running in London. Thios bus began its working life in Catford, south London, in June 1922 and Mr Banfield bought this from a scrapyard on February 17 1970. It sold for £216,540.

1906 Minerva Roi Des Belges.  The Minerva was created by Sylvain de Jong who in 1889 began a Belgian company importing English bicycles. He began manufacturing cars in 1902 and the following year founded the Société Anonyme Minerva Motors. This car sold for £177,340

1904 Mors Roi des Belges: The Mors company was founded by Emile Mors, one of France's leading electrical engineers, heading one of the country's biggest telegraph, telephone and electrical equipment factories. He began racing cars and in 1897 finished in seventh place in the 106-mile Paris Dieppe Race in a car with an average speed of 19.6 mph

1916 Crossley RF Van: On the outbreak of war in August 1914 Crossley of Manchester changed its production line to almost entirely to producing vehicles for military service. By the Armistice, there were more than 6,000 being used and for 25 years Crossley was the preferred supplier to the RAF. This one sold for £52,900

1935 Austin Taxi. One of the last vehicular additions to Mr Banfield's collection, he bought this in 2011 from Dr Peter McWilliam of Yorkshire, who had owned it for 20 years. The model was introduced in 1930 and this particular car went into service in March 1935. It was a reliable cab and the last left service in the 1960s, although this one stopped its working life in the previous decade. It sold for £67,580

Michael Banfield raises a glass to the Fiat country bus. The vehicle was introduced in 1910 with a 2.6-litre engine and a four-speed gearbox. The Italian army used this as its main way of moving troops around during the Italo-Libyan war of 1911-1912. Mr Banfield's vehicle was registered in Hampshire but its body was later replaced by a bus chassis and the Fiat worked in the Reading area as a station bus

Michael Banfield with his Wolseley lorry at Iden Grange. In 1912, buyers who purchased a certain type of lorry were paid an annual subsidy of £110 to keep them in good order, the rationale being that they would be taken into Army service should war arise. This particular lorry was powered by an 8522cc bi-block four-cylinder engine. Michael Banfield bought it in the 1980s and maintained the lorry so that it is still in good working order. It sold for £23,000
