It seems that it will not be the usual green, gold and blue flag that helps shape Brazil's destiny in their World Cup semi-final with Germany - instead it is the 'lucky' emblem of their bitter rivals Argentina.

Or at least that seems to be the view of Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari and captain Thiago Silva, who posed for a photograph with the flag supplied by Argentina newspaper El Diario de la Republica during their pre-match press conference.

In fact, it is the second time that Scolari has been snapped with the 'lucky' blue and white striped flag after he agreed to be photographed with it before Brazil's last-16 match with Chile.

And after the Selecao won through on penalties against their South American rivals, Scolari was quick to accept the invitation to pose with it once more before their semi-final clash with Germany in Belo Horizonte.

In fact, Scolari called across his captain Silva - who is suspended for the last-four tie after picking up his second yellow card of the tournament against Colombia - and told him to pose as well because 'this flag brought us luck'.

If hosts Brazil are to triumph and reach Sunday's final at their famous Maracana Stadium then they may just be relying on the luck of their bitter rivals in order to get them there.
