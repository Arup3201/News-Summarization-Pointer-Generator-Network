West Ham supporters have given a mixed reaction after details of a £2,616 corporate hospitality packages at their new Olympic Stadium home were announced.

The Barclays Premier League club launched the Boleyn package on Monday, which involves a dedicated bar with free half-time drinks, a VIP entrance and seats on the halfway line for 1,000 fans willing to pay the fee.

The deal sees the first season cost £2,616 and those after £2,016, but any supporters interested in the package have to commit for three years, meaning they must pay £6,648 in total.

It includes all of the club's Premier League home matches and match-day programmes, the first three cup games, and offers priority for semi-finals and finals.

West Ham leave the Boleyn Ground for Stratford in August 2016, but some fans haven't taken kindly to the proposed package.

'It's not the working man's game anymore, hasn't been for a while now,' Paul Daniels wrote on West Ham Til I Die. 'New plastic fans with no sense of history are taking over. Videoing on their mobiles to show their mates they are at the match.

'More of a status symbol these days. Modern life is rubbish. Viva le Bovril and Wagon Wheels.'

Sean Whetstone, on the other hand, feels it will benefit the club at their new home: 'Whilst I understand some of the comments I also appreciate West Ham need to cater for more affluent fans who can afford this new package.

'It should raise £6.6million for the first three years which will help invest in better players to improve our successes on the pitch, many may not like it but it is just progress.'

And on Knees Up Mother Brown, Hammerted wrote: 'I think it's a great idea that will generate extra funds for our club from those fans who are fortunate enough to be able to afford it. I wish I was one of them, but I don't begrudge them, nor do I berate those behind the plan.

A West Ham source said: ‘The Boleyn was only launched on Monday morning but demand has been four times higher than the Club’s expectations.

'If sales continue at the same pace as we have seen today, The Boleyn will be sold out well ahead of schedule.'
