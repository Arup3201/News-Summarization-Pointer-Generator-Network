Death: Dawn Liddell, 42, of Foxwood, North Yorkshire, had to wait almost 20 hours for a CT scan in 2008

A mother died despite a string of opportunities for doctors to diagnose a brain haemorrhage and her brother’s warnings that she would leave hospital ‘in a body bag’, an inquest has heard.

Dawn Liddell, 42, of Foxwood, North Yorkshire, was sent home from her GP and local hospital twice and had to wait almost 20 hours for a CT scan, York Coroner’s Court was told.

She had already seen her doctor in August 2008 believing her severe headache was caused by an insect bite - but attended hospital the next month when her condition did not improve.

Ms Liddell was given painkillers and told to contact her GP if her symptoms continued. But after collapsing and having a seizure four days later, she arrived at York Hospital at 8.25pm.

But the shop assistant was not booked in for a CT scan until 19 hours after arriving - despite repeated requests and her family history of haemorrhages. The CT scan had actually been cancelled while she waited for an MRI scan.

But her condition worsened and she died of a brain haemorrhage caused by the rupture of an artery aneurysm. By the time a scan showed the brain haemorrhage, it was too late to save her.

Her brother Phill Liddell said he could not understand the delays in diagnosis when there was a family history of brain haemorrhages.

He told the court: ‘I said to the doctor “she is having a brain haemorrhage”. I said “she will leave here in a body bag”.’

Faults: In 2011, York Hospital accepted that with the right care she was unlikely to have died and paid a 'significant' sum of compensation to her 21-year-old son

In 2011, York Hospital accepted that 
with the right care she was unlikely to have died and paid a 
‘significant’ sum of compensation to her 21-year-old son, Jordan Hattee.

The Trust admitted in its apologetic letter that she should have been referred for a CT scan on her visit to hospital.

It
said: ‘This would have shown the presence of a haemorrhage and she 
would then have been transferred to the Neurological Centre at Hull.

‘An
angiogram would then have identified the aneurysm and subsequent 
treatment would have given her a survival rate of 80 to 85 per cent.’

The inquest yesterday heard there were four occasions when an opportunity was missed to give her a CT scan.

This
would have meant she could have had an operation giving her the ‘best 
chance’ of survival, a serious untoward incident report by the hospital 
found.

Chances were missed when she visited her GP, in A&E on September 4, when she went back to hospital on September 8 and on the morning of September 9 - the day she later died.

Recording that she died of natural causes, coroner Donald Coverdale said: ‘It’s not clear why the scan took so many hours to carry out.

‘It has been suggested there may have been problems with the equipment. One hopes the lessons learned - and indeed lessons must be learned - have been followed up.’

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Liddell said: ‘I know the doctors involved didn’t leave the house in the morning and intend for this to happen, but a mistake has caused the death of my sister.

‘It’s as if no-one has got any responsibility for what they are doing.’

A York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation 
Trust spokesman said: ‘We are sorry for the circumstances surrounding 
Dawn’s death, and once again extend our condolences to her family.

'I said to the doctor, "she is having a brain haemorrhage". I said "She will leave here in a body bag"'

‘This was investigated by the Trust and we accept that there are things we should have done differently.

‘As a result of our investigation, recommendations were made and measures have been put in place to try to prevent this being repeated.’

After the hospital’s apology in 2011, her mother Beryl revealed she suffered a brain haemorrhage at the age of 21 and said doctors should have been more aware that her daughter may have had a heightened risk of a similar attack.

She said: ‘I collapsed in 1967 and a doctor came out immediately. He knew it was serious and I was rushed to hospital. There were no scans in those days so they gave me a lumbar puncture and found I had a brain haemorrhage.

‘But they missed so many chances to save Dawn. They should have sent her for a scan regardless, it’s because of that she’s not here today.

‘It seems to me the treatment I got in the 60s was better than the care she got and that’s why she’s no longer with us.’

Performing arts student Mr Hattee said: ‘She was in hospital for hours until she had a fit without having a brain scan. Throughout the night she kept complaining of head pains, I told the doctors and nurses this throughout the night.’
