As she looks around in a carefree fashion with her baby macaque holding on tightly, it's hard to believe this monkey mother is so confident while perching on the edge of a  1,000 metre mountain drop.

The long-tailed grey macaque monkey threw caution to the wind at the dizzying height on Lombok Island, Indonesia.

Photographer Marian Kaczmarczyk, 37, from Teddington, London, captured the snap while trekking to Mount Rinjani.

Mr Kaczmarczyk decided to stay at base camp while others went to the summit and the monkeys turned up to rifle through their leftovers.

He said: 'There were about 20 monkeys and they were very clever because they knew the group would leave food for them.

'I was really surprised by how many of them live and survive so high in the mountains.

'The mum appeared at the edge with her baby and I only had a few seconds to get the shot.'I wasn't surprised at the height because I've seen them sleeping high up in the trees.

'I think they have so much strength in their tails, upper and lower limbs they can easily rest, seat and move everywhere they like.

'The drop under the monkey with her baby was approximately 1,000 metres and it looked quite dramatic when she held the baby in that spot.

'I had to be extremely because they are noisy, have an aggressive temperament and sometimes travel in large troupes.'

Marian added: 'I was very happy and proud when I saw the photos and they were the best photos of my time in Indonesia.'
