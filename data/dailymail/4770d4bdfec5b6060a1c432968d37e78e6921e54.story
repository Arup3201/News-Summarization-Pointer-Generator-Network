Facebook has removed a video of a woman being beheaded following the huge public outcry that was sparked by their lifting of a ban on gory imagery on Monday.

The abrupt abrupt flip-flop came a day after a public outcry over news reports that Facebook, the world's No. 1 social network with 1.15 billion members, had lifted a temporary ban on images of graphic violence.

Facebook said on Monday that gory videos, such as a video of a masked man beheading a woman in Mexico, are permitted on its site so long as the content is posted in a manner intended for its users to 'condemn' the acts rather than celebrate them.

Gruesome videos of people being beheaded are to be allowed on Facebook once again. The social network claims that its users should be able to watch and condemn these videos, but not celebrate them

But Facebook said on Tuesday that it had decided to 'strengthen' its enforcement of the policy.

'When we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video,' Facebook said in a statement.

'Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience,' Facebook said.

The flip-flop underscores a challenge for Facebook as it seeks to position itself as the go-to online destination where people share up-to-the-minute images and discuss breaking news events.

Alert: Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its website showing decapitations

Facebook initially claimed that the criticism it received did not affect its decision but later on Tuesday admitted it had.

The British Prime Minister David Cameron went on the warpath on Tuesday accusing Facebook of irresponsibility after it lifted a ban on users posting videos of beheadings - and demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents.

Critics accused the firm of ‘taking leave of its senses’. Facebook had said that while the images must not be posted for ‘sadistic pleasure’ they should be available for those who wish to condemn them.

However, last night it was revealed Facebook had removed the clip of a woman being beheaded and said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site.

Facebook’s unpublicized change in policy came to light after it refused to remove a 57-second video showing a young Mexican woman, her hands tied behind her back and on her knees, being beheaded by a masked man in broad daylight. It was posted last week under the title ‘Challenge: Anybody can watch this video?’.

The site, which is open to anyone over the age of 13, had banned footage of decapitation on its site in May citing concerns that it would cause long-term psychological damage

One disgusted viewer commented: ‘Remove this video, too many young innocent minds out there shouldn’t see this.’

Another wrote: ‘This is absolutely horrible, distasteful and needs to be removed... I’m very disturbed after seeing a couple of seconds of it.’

Facebook had introduced a temporary ban on decapitation videos in May but later removed it, explaining that the site is used to share information about world events, such as acts of terrorism and human rights abuses.

While Facebook polices its site to remove pornography, hate speech and other forbidden content, the company must also make a judgment about when certain grizzly images, such as video of a terrorist attack, are in the public interest versus being shared for 'sadistic pleasure.'

Facebook acknowledged on Tuesday that its previous approach, which permitted the video of the woman's killing in Mexico to remain on its site, was flawed.

'Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it,' the company said.

Facebook may now allow 
videos of people being beheaded, but there are a number of subjects and 
clips it will not allow to be published on in its site.

Facebook
has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any
explicitly sexual content where a child is involved.

Elsewhere,
the site imposes ‘limitations on the display of nudity’ but doesn’t ban
it outright - it depends on the context and circumstance.

Female
nipples, as a rule, will be removed but male nipples are allowed. A 
photo was famously removed last year when an elbow was mistaken for a 
female nipple, before being reinstated.

Breastfeeding images were removed in 
2012, but Facebook’s Community Guidelines now states the site ‘respects 
people’s right to share content of personal importance’ and makes 
explicit reference to breastfeeding.

The
pictures are allowed if the child is seen ‘actively nursing’ but may be
removed if it shows the nipple. Children playing in the bath are 
accepted as long as they are not graphic and explicit, while sculpture 
and art work that depicts the naked body is allowed, but real-life 
images and similar poses are not.

Another
photo famously taken down showed Kylie Minogue holding a teddy bear 
with her microphone positioned in such a way, between the bear’s legs, 
that made it look phallic. Facebook removed it for violating the use of 
‘photos that contain nudity, drug use or violence.’

Any
video that condones violence, threatens or is abusive and bullying 
towards another person or promotes criminal activity is prohibited. Any 
promotion or encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders of drug 
abuse is similarly banned.

Facebook
does not permit hate speech, especially towards individuals, groups, 
sex, race, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation – yet will 
distinguish between ‘serious and humorous speech’ and will allow videos 
and posts that ‘challenge ideas, institutions and certain practices.’

Sharing
graphic content for 'sadistic pleasure' is prohibited, yet if the 
content is shared in the process of reporting current events it is be 
allowed as long as it balances ‘the needs of a diverse community.’

Facebook
monitors photos, but also relies on its users to report content they 
feel should be removed. If a photo is under investigation it may be 
temporarily removed while Facebook looks into the complaint but will be 
reinstated if it is found not to have breached the code.
