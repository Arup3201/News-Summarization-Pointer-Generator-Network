Zinedine Zidane has been suspended from coaching for three months as a consequence of not having the required Level 3 qualification demanded by Spanish authorities.

The former World Cup winner served as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant with the Real Madrid first team in 2013 before taking charge of the Castilla B team, although his assistant Santiago Sanchez was named as head coach.

However, following an official complaint lodged with the country's football federation, Competition Committee judge Francisco Rubio has decided to ban Zidane and Sanchez from coaching for three months.

Rubio accepted a complaint lodged by Miguel Galan, president of Spain's national training center for football coaches.

Madrid announced in June that Zidane, who played at the club from 2001 until retiring in 2006, would coach its reserve team this season. However, Galan complained that Zidane lacked the appropriate qualifications to do so, and Rubio agreed.

The former Madrid star currently carries a UEFA A Licence, equivalent to a Level 2 qualification. He escaped a six-month ban but must now obtain the 3rd level of his French coaching qualifications by April 2015. The 42-year-old had previously complained at the treatment he has received over the matter.

He told Le Figaro: 'I have no regrets about having taken my qualifications in France. It's still amazing that there are also so few people to defend me and explain that I did not have special privilege.

'I did not circumvent the difficulty - but some took the opportunity to spit on me.'

It is not the first time that the Frenchman has fallen foul of authorities - having been banned for three games and fined £3,260 following his infamous headbutt on Italy defender Marco Materazzi that saw him sent off in the 2006 World Cup final.

Real Madrid have 10 working days to appeal against the decision with the Competition Committee’s appeals tribunal, and could also be taken to Spain’s Administrative Court for Sport. 

As a final resort, an appeal could be made to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

In response to the sanction handed down by the Competition Committee to the Real Madrid Castilla's head coach and second coach, Santiago Sánchez and Zinedine Zidane respectively, Real Madrid C. F. would like to outline the following:

1. The club's absolute disagreement with the decision, not least of all because Zinedine Zidane has been authorised by the French Football Federation to work as a head coach in the category Real Madrid Castilla currently find themselves in, as the certificate issued by said Federation from 13 October 2014 states.

2. Real Madrid will pursue every available legal avenue so that this decision is overturned.
