Labour leader Ed Miliband today promised to end the 'terrible scandal' of low pay by linking the minimum wage to average earnings.

But the move threatened to backfire after the Tories highlighted official figures which suggested the minimum wage would be 20p lower today if the policy had been introduced in 2010 when they took over.

Business Minister Matthew Hancock claimed the minimum wage had 'never been higher' as a proportion of wages, suggesting that Labour's proposal would hit low earners in the pocket.

Labour rejected the claim - as seperate analysis said the national minimum wage could be worth more than 60p an hour for 5.2 million people if it was set at 60 per cent of average take home pay.

Mr Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Britain had 'much, much further to go' to end poverty pay.

He said increasing the minimum wage as part of a 'national mission' for the Labour party.

The Labour leader said: 'What we’re proposing is the government will set, the next Labour government will set a target for the minimum wage for the five years of the next parliament, set as a proportion of average earnings.

'We want to raise it as a proportion of average earnings compared to where it is now because I believe the minimum wage is too low, I don’t believe we’re doing enough to tackle low pay.'

But official figures over the four years since 2010 show that average earnings rose 6.2 per cent according to the Offiice for National Statistics.

At the same time, the national minimum wage will have gone up by 9.6 per cent, the low pay commission says.

If the Government had linked the minimum wage to average earnings it would have gone up from £5.93 to £6.30 - and not the £6.50 it is today.

Mr Miliband this morning insisted he was not going to set out the exact level he wanted to minimum wage to be - but the Tories insisted his plan to link it to average earnings could hit ordinary workers' pay packets.

He said: 'I don’t want to be overly coy, but I don’t want to name a figure today because we precisely want to get this right.

'What we need is something which is a much clearer aim for a parliament and it will be the Low Pay Commission’s job to meet that target and I think that’s the right thing to do for our country.

'We can carry on as we are, or we can say this isn’t good enough and we’ve got to change and we’ve got to build a higher wage, higher skill economy with higher productivity and the minimum wage is an essential part of that.'

Under the Labour leader's plans a five-year target would be set in 2015 by the new Government, with the independent Low Pay Commission left to decide how best to implement it.

The minimum wage is currently £6.31 for adults, but less for younger people and apprentices, and is due to rise to £6.50 this year.

One suggestion is that Labour would raise the minimum hourly rate to 60 per cent of median earnings, which would see it rise to around £7.14.

Explaining the minimum wage

Mr Miliband said: 'I want people to be
 in no doubt - we are determined, as part of a national mission for the 
next Labour government, to tackle the problem of low pay and 
substantially raise the minimum wage.'

He said his proposal 'gets at what I 
think is aterrible scandal in this country, which is that we have still
 five million people in low-paid work, unable to make ends meet'.

The
 Labour leader added: 'The minimum wage has done a good job in tackling 
the worst of exploitation, but we’ve got to go further now in tackling 
the problem of low pay.'

But the plans were attacked by business groups.

The CBI's Katja Hall said: ‘The national 
minimum wage has been a success in raising wages for the lowest paid 
because it's been left to the Low Pay Commission, not politicians, to 
set the rate.

'A government proposed target would undermine the Commission’s independence.'

The manufacturer's organisation the EEF said: ‘The proposals to overhaul the remit of the Low Pay Commission, including…setting a statutory minimum wage target linked to average earnings is an unnecessary distraction. Its primary objective is to provide an evidence-based judgement on what the National Minimum Wage rates should be.'

The British Chambers of Commerce said: ‘There is a clear risk that ahead of next year's general election, politicking around the minimum wage…could lead to unaffordable promises that cost jobs and growth.

'The Low Pay Commission must be allowed to get on with its job and base recommendations on clear economic evidence, not political promises.'

And the Institute of Directors said: ‘The minimum wage must not become the subject of a political competition to see who can offer the most, irrespective of what the economy and employers and can afford.

'The Low Pay Commission has done a good job of balancing the rate against inflation, economic growth, productivity and the effect rises would have on small businesses and young people.

'In contrast, setting a target linked to average earnings risks seeming a little simplistic…Any increase to the minimum wage must be timed carefully, and ultimately reducing the tax burden on both employers and employees will help strengthen the position of those in low paid jobs.'

Mr Miliband insisted it was not 'anti-business', adding: 'He argued it was the Tories, not Labour, who were seen abroad as a threat to business prospects.

'I’m the person who’s saying we’ve got to stay in Europe, that we’ve got to reform the European Union.

'What’s the biggest threat to prosperity in this country? It’s the potential of a Conservative government after the next election which has Britain turning inwards for two years, deciding whether to exit the European Union.'

@highlight

Labour would link minimum wage to average earnings to boost low pay

@highlight

But minimum wage has risen more than average earnings since last election

@highlight

Set to rise to £6.50 but would've been just £6.30 under proposal, say critics

@highlight

But if it was pegged at 60% of average earnings it would rise by 60p
