If you're in the market to buy a brownstone in Brooklyn, good luck - according to a new report, investors are swiping up brownstones in some of Brooklyn's emerging neighborhoods before they are ever put on the market.

The run on brownstones is only adding to the lack of inventory and price increases for would-be buyers.

These investors are paying cash for the buildings - primarily in the borough's Crown Heights, Bed-Stuy and Bushwick neighborhoods - and leasing the properties to renters rather than flipping them and re-selling them.

$$$: Investors scooping up brownstones in Brooklyn is keeping many of the properties off the market and driving up prices

“They come to all the open houses, they see every property,” a 'tipster' told the blog Brownstoner.

According to the blog, these investors 'go after everything' - foreclosures, houses that would normally sit on the market such as SROs (single-room occupancy) 
and wrecks, and regular properties that qualify for a mortgage.

'They are focusing on one- to three-families, the same types of houses 
would-be homeowners are looking to purchase to occupy — not groups of 
houses or large apartment buildings, although occasionally they pick up 
single-family houses that have been subdivided into more than four 
units,' the blog explains.

According to the 'tipster,' she has encountered five investment firms, each of which is trying to buy five to 10 houses a month, all with cash.

Some of the purchases, the tipster says, 'make no sense,' like SROs without certificates of non-harassment and properties with stop work orders on them.

'Everyone’s talking about there not being any inventory,' she said. 'There’s plenty of inventory, it’s just not being offered anymore...there’s so much money around. A lot is getting bought out quickly. 
They’re not end users.”

Emerging: Bushwick, Bed-Stuy and Crown Heights are considered to be up-and-coming sections of Brooklyn

The blog spoke with a man who has been 'aggressively' looking to purchase a brownstone in Bed-Stuy, Bushwick or Crown Heights for the last two months, but says he keeps getting beat out by investors.

'It seems that I’m being outbid left and right by investors who are coming to the table with cash in hand as soon as (or before) the house lists,' he says.

Realtors say that many of the investment groups are foreign, hailing mainly from Europe and Israel.

One group, with the operating name of Newtown Jets, has scooped up 24 properties in Brooklyn since March. According to the blog, 'the transactions were all over the map geographically and pricewise, from
 Park Slope ($2,675,000) and Carroll Gardens ($1,699,000) to Bushwick 
($662,500 and $599,000).'

Newtown Jets is a subsidiary of US Masters Residential Property Fund, Alan Dixon, Managing Director and CEO of Dixon Leasing, told the blog.

Renovations: an upside to investors buying brownstones is that they often renovate them and modernize the interiors

'The fund 
has purchased a total of 47 properties in Brooklyn since December 2012 
and has 22 under contract. (Each of its buying groups is named after an 
Australian football team.) The fund has paid an average of $1,200,000 
per property,' the blog says. 'The fund buys to hold and rent for at least five years, as
 required by the tax agreement between Australia and the U.S.'

'You buy a
 property, renovate it, and the bank advances funds against a group of 
property,” Dixon said.

The upside to investors buying up in many cases dilapidated, old buildings is that they fix them up and renovate them. But in doing so, they drive up the cost and make living in Brooklyn nearly as expensive as living in Manhattan.

'Do you think investor groups snapping up property in Brooklyn could be 
good, on the one hand, because they are fixing up and renting out 
problem properties,' the blogger asks, 'or is it making Brooklyn unaffordable and creating 
another unsustainable real estate bubble?'
