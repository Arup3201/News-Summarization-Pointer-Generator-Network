A former Colorado jail officer who was arrested on suspicion of killing his wife three years after police ruled it a suicide insisted that scratches on his chest after her death were from shaving.

But the marks across Tom Fallis' chest - and the fact his DNA was found under his wife's nails - suggest that the couple had been in a struggle before he shot her, KDVR-TV reported.

The new evidence has emerged in the report by journalist Justin Joseph, whose damning reports about the case led to police agreeing to reopen the investigation in April last year.

In November, Tom Fallis was arrested on suspicion of killing his wife, Ashley Fallis, in January 2012.

Loss: Ashley Fallis, pictured with her children, was found dead on New Year's Day 2012 after he husband said she committed suicide. But three years on, her husband was arrested and further evidence has emerged

Ashley, a 28-year-old mother-of-three, was found shot in the back of the head after a booze-fueled New Year's Eve party at the Fallis home turned sour when Tom Fallis learned someone had brought marijuana to the party and became enraged.

Fallis, who was working as a Weld County corrections officer, called 911 in screaming hysterics to say his wife had committed suicide. He angrily denied that he had anything to do with his wife's death and Evans police quickly ruled that Ashley had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 

But Ashley Fallis' family never believed she had killed herself and campaigned for police in Evans to reopen the case and investigate whether her husband was responsible. 

A police interview after her death has now shown Tom Fallis denying the scratches across his chest and neck had anything to do with her death. 

'I didn't shoot my wife,' he insists in the interview, which was recorded.

'Tell me what happened then!' the detective responds. 'Why do you have scratches on your body?'

Denial: In an interview after his wife was found dead (pictured), Tom Fallis insisted they had not fought on the night of her death - despite witness accounts - and said he had not killed her

'Evidence': Investigators took photos of his chest, which showed signs of scratches after her death

Wounds: Scratches can be seen on his neck - and investigators say his DNA was found under his wife's nails

Protests: In the interview, Fallis insisted the scratches were from his skin being irritated after he shaved. He can be seen demonstrating how he scratched his chest

'When you shave your chest you do this all day!' he says, lifting up his shirt and scratching his chest. 

The marks were swabbed for DNA and photographed, KDVR reported.

Arrest: After pressure from Ashley Fallis' parents, Tom Fallis, pictured, was arrested in November

Ashley Fallis' nails were also swabbed - and sources told the station that those swabs tested positive for her husband's DNA, 'calling into question whether Fallis lied that night', Joseph reported.

But the DNA and scratches are not the only pieces of evidence that raise questions. 

Among the details that KDVR uncovered: A friend at the party who said he overheard Ashley crying for her husband to get off of her; a neighbor who said he heard outside his window as Tom Fallis confess to killing his wife; reports from Ashley's parents that he had been violently angry before Ashley's death; clear evidence of a struggle in the bedroom where Ashley's body was found.

Most shockingly, one of the the Fallis' young children, age six, told police that she saw 'daddy getting the gun ready' and 'saw daddy shoot mommy'/

'He was irate and explosive. He was abusive with his words and he was telling us he hated us, and to 'F everybody' and then he went into the room and slammed the door,' Ashley's mother, Jenna Fox, told KDVR.

But in the interview, Fallis insisted that he never argued with his wife.

After he claimed the scratches were not from Ashley, the detective asked: 'Why would she tell you to get off of her then?'

'I was never on her,' he responded.

Determined: Ashley's mother, Jenna Fox, who has fought for justice, called the new DNA evidence 'powerful'

And in a bizarre twist, he claimed he found two alleged suicide notes from Ashley late last year - nearly three years after her death. 

Ashley's mother, Jenna Fox, told KDVR that it's 'suspect' that he's only just come forward with the notes. 

'If anything they are probably notes from Ashley discussing her struggle as a wife and not her alleged intention to kill herself,' she said. 

In November, he was arrested in Bloomington, Indiana, where he had been living with the couple's three young children after fleeing Colorado. He was extradited back to Colorado.

He has always maintained his innocence.

The children were handed over to Ashley's parents, Jenna Fox and Joel Raguindin. 

The couple had never gave up their search for justice. They rallied friends and supporters to picket outside the police station when Ashley's death was ruled a suicide.
