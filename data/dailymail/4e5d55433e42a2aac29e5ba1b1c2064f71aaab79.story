Her dazzling smile might suggest she is at peace with the world. But behind the façade, Gloria Hunniford has revealed she is still consumed with grief at the loss of her daughter and misses her 'hundreds of times a day'.

The 72-year-old TV presenter said Caron Keating's death left an agonising 'black hole' in her life that she can never hope to heal more than eight years later.

The Blue Peter presenter was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997 and died in her mother's arms, aged 41, in 2004.

Gaping black hole: Gloria Hunniford said she will never recover from losing daughter Caron Keating to breast cancer in 2004

On Sunday, Miss Hunniford will host a gala performance of 42nd street at the London Palladium in aid of the Caron Keating Foundation. She said running the charity has been a form of 'therapy' because it helps take her mind off her grief.

She told the Daily Mail: 'People say time is a healer. They say the pain will fade. But you never really recover from the loss of a child. It leaves a gaping black hole in your life. You can only get a little bit better at avoiding the issue, skirting round it and not dwelling on the bad.

'Caron died eight years ago but I still think of her hundreds of times a day. If I am in a shop, I think, "She would have loved this dress". If I am making food, I think, "She would have wanted a taste of this".

'If I am having a lovely time with my grandsons I think, "If only she was here."

She added: 'Mother's Day is particularly hard. Caron was so thoughtful. She always gave up her time and came up with lovely gifts.

'It inevitably brings up memories, and it can be hard to cope. The first Christmas, the first birthday and the first Mother's Day without Caron were hideous.

'Thankfully I have two wonderful sons who are there for me and make it more bearable.'

Miss Hunniford has written two books about her bereavement and has raised more than £4million for cancer charities through the Caron Keating Foundation.

She said: 'The Foundation is my therapy. It keeps me busy. For me, the best way of dealing with grief is to be proactive.

'No parent should ever have to see their child die before them. It is against the natural order of things.

'Caron was so young. She was in her thirties when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The day she was diagnosed was almost as bad as the day she died. I knew immediately life would never be the same again. It took away my carefree attitude to life in one stroke.

'As a mother you carry your baby inside you for nine months and form an incredible bond. To bury your child is indescribably painful.'

Miss Keating had two sons, Charlie, now 19, and Gabriel, now 15, with her husband Russ Lindsay. Mr Lindsay was criticised for marrying her friend, TV presenter Sally Meen, 47, less than two years after her death. The couple now have a daughter of their own, Tilly, four.

Russ went on to marry Sally Meen less than two years after Caron's death: Gloria said her daughter would have been 'grateful' her sons Charlie, left, and Gabriel, had a step-mother to look after them

But Miss Hunniford denied rumours she once fell out with Miss Meen, thanking her for being a good mother to her grandsons.

She said: 'Sally was obviously in a hard position to start with. Any woman coming into that situation would take a while to find her place.

'But she has really looked after the boys so well. Caron would have been so grateful. And she would have loved the fact her sons now have a half-sister as well.'

The Caron Keating Foundation will hold a fundraising gala performance of 42nd Street at the London Palladium this Sunday 17 March
