A pensioner was fighting for his life in hospital today after crashing his neighbour’s brand new 1000cc superbike - after he had vowed never to ride again.

Bike fanatic George Tawse, 68, hopped on the showroom-fresh Yamaha FZ1 motorcycle after his neighbour pulled up outside his home in Cloverfield Gardens, Aberdeen.

With no safety helmet, Mr Tawse revved the powerful bike before skidding off and crashing further up the street at about 3.30pm yesterday afternoon.

Tragic: George Tawse, a 68-year-old pensioner 
from Aberdeen who is in critical condition after crashing his 
neighbour's brand new 1,000cc superbike yesterday afternoon

Horrified onlookers described watching the pensioner lose control, falling over beside a traffic island at the Sclattie Park junction.

The owner of the bike, who has been a neighbour of Mr Tawse for 10 years, said the OAP mounted his £7,000 just after he pulled up outside his house.

The man, who didn’t want to be named, said: 'I had just arrived back from the showroom. George came down. He was all excited.

'He just took off and lost control. It all happened so quick I couldn’t believe it. I’m gutted. I just keep thinking what if I had managed to grab hold of it and turn it off.'

Motorcycle fanatic: But Mr Tawse had vowed never to ride again after he a terrible crash a decade ago that left him in intensive care for three weeks. He was only saved thanks to three surgeons who happened to pass by

The man said he and other neighbours tried to put Mr Tawse in the recovery position until an ambulance arrived.

Mr Tawse, a former paper mill worker and father-of-two, was injured in another bike crash nearly a decade ago when he became trapped under a tractor.

The accident on the B977 near Potterton, Aberdeenshire, on August 13, 2002, left him with abdominal injuries, a collapsed lung and bleeding in the brain.

After making a full recovery, Mr Tawse vowed never ride a motorbike again. Speaking at the time he said: 'I’ll never get on a bike again, I’d be terrified.

'I don’t think I could take another whack like that.' Mr Tawse also claimed he would not have made it through if it was not for three off-duty medics.

The bike at the scene of Mr Tawse's crash 
yesterday: The pensioner's wife Clementina was understood to be by his 
bedside at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary today, where his condition is said to be 'life threatening'

Plastic surgeons Bruce Elliott and Amer Durrani, and anaesthetist Liz Roy, were driving from Aberdeen Airport when they found the pensioner’s legs trapped under the rear wheel of the tractor.

One surgeon inserted a needle into the injured pensioner’s chest to allow him to breathe and he spent a month at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, including three weeks in intensive care.

The pensioner’s wife Clementina was understood to be by his bedside today at the same hospital, where his condition was described as 'life threatening'.

The motorbike was seized by Grampian Police as part of an investigation into the incident.
