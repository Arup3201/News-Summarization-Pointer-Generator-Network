Real Madrid defender Pepe has revealed he does not miss former boss Jose Mourinho and says he is much happier now that Carlo Ancelotti is in charge of the club. 

Mourinho managed Madrid between 2010 and 2013, winning the Copa del Rey in 2011 and La Liga in 2012, but his final months in Spain were marred by a series of high-profile fall outs with senior players, including Pepe. 

The outspoken centre-back told COPE: 'I don't miss Mourinho. It was a different era which is over.'

Current Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has faced criticism in recent weeks for the team's dip in form 

Mourinho was replaced at the Santiago Bernabeu by Carlo Ancelotti, who guided Los Blancos to 'La Decima' - the club's 10th European Cup - last season after they beat city rivals Atletico Madrid 4-1 in the final.

However, with Madrid's recent dip in form - they have lost their last two games - the Italian's stock has fallen among the fans. 

But Pepe is adamant that Ancelotti is the right man for the job and in his opinion, better than Mourinho. 

'Ancelotti is not too lenient with us. He has a very distinguished curriculum and he demands a lot from us. Our training sessions under Ancelotti are much more intensive than they were under Mourinho,' he said. 

'I thank God that I've a coach like him, he's really helped me a lot. He tells me: 'Pepe, with your quality, you've got to anticipate play. You're fast and strong and you read the game well. You need to be focused'.' 

The 32-year-old also took time to defend captain and goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for his performances. Despite a nervy display against Schalke in the Champions League, Pepe insisted that Casillas is the best players in the world in his position.

'Casillas is the best goalkeeper in the world right now. It's strange that someone like him gets whistled.'
