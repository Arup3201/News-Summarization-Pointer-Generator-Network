Portugal may be relying on how he takes to the world stage in Brazil but it seems Cristiano Ronaldo can take it all in his stride - even when it involves being chased by women.

The 29-year-old looked relaxed training with his national team-mates before a female pitch invader decided to take matters into her own hands if she was to meet her hero.

Bodyguards had to escort the excited fan, wearing a Portugal shirt with Ronaldo on the back, off the training pitch.

It didn't stop Ronaldo from clowning around, though, as the prolific goalscorer looked in good spirits ahead of the World Cup opener against Brazil and Croatia on Thursday night.

Portugal's first game is on Monday, and they couldn't have asked for a tougher draw.

Ronaldo and his team-mates will face Germany in their opening match, as they bid to survive Group G alongside USA and Ghana.
