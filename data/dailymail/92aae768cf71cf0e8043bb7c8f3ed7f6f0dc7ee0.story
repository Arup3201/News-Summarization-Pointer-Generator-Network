A professor at Miami-Dade College was mercilessly beaten up at the Kendall campus last week, and he believes a spurned student may be to blame.

While Professor Marc Magellan didn't recognize the assailant, nothing was stolen which leads him to think it was a hired hit.

'There is nobody I can think of who would have wanted to attack me so brutally unless there was some sort of grudge or chip on their shoulder,' Mr Magellan told the Miami Herald in an email. 'In my business, the only people who hold grudges are the ones who I've had to drop or fail. It comes with the territory I guess.'

Injured: Miami-Dade College Professor Marc Magellan was brutally beaten up leaving campus last week. He suffered a broken nose and hand in the attack

Before and after: Mr Magellan says nothing was stolen from him, which leads him to believe the attack was organized by a student with a grudge

The attack happened April 15, just before 6pm in a campus parking garage, as the 31-year-old jazz and music history professor was leaving campus to go home.

He says he turned around when he heard a man call out 'Professor Marc' and that's when he was hit with a sucker-punch to the face. 

The hit took him so by surprise that he was knocked to the ground, where the attacker continued to beat him up 'unmercifully' against the pavement.

At one point, Mr Magellan says the assailant, who he didn't recognize as a student, 'was powerfully punching the side of my head against the concrete floor of the garage'.

On high alert: Security has been stepped up at Miami-Dade College's Kendall campus following the attack

Mr Magellan suffered a broken nose, broken hand and other injuries to his head, face, arms, knees and feet before the attacker fled, speeding off in a blue sports car.

After the attack, Mr Magellan spent five hours in Baptist Hospital's emergency room before returning home to recover for a week and see specialists.

He had his first day back in class on Monday, and told MailOnline that everyone on campus was 'exceptionally nice and supportive'.

He says he considers himself 'very lucky' since he easily could have died being beaten on concrete.

Mr Magellan's beating seems surprising considering the overwhelmingly positive reviews he has received on RateMyProfessor.com.

Many of the student reviewers call him the best professor they've ever had, with one student saying they switched their major to art history after taking his class.

Tough teacher? Mr Magellan has received almost all positive reviews on his Rate My Professor page, but one of the reviews call his class to hard for an elective

But a recent review was less positive, calling his class 'ridiculously hard for an elective'.

'DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY,' the review reads. '...STAY AWAY if you don't want to hurt your GPA.'

Following the attack, school spokesman Juan Mendieta issued a statement calling the beating 'disturbing'.

'The battery appears to be a very isolated incident and possibly targeted...the Kendall Campus is normally a very safe campus. However, in an abundance of caution, the campus leadership has further heightened security,' Mr Mendieta said.

The attacker was described as 5-foot 10, weighing 180 pounds and either Hispanic or African-American.

He was wearing a white shirt, white pants and red shoes.

Anyone with information on the attack is being asked to call the Crime Stoppers hotline at 305-471-TIPS.
