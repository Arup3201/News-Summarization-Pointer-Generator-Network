Labour attempts to split the coalition are in tatters tonight after the government agreed on an unprecedented fudge to spare the Liberal Democrats’ blushes.

Ministers spent the day thrashing out a way to prevent Nick Clegg’s party from having to vote against his treasured Mansion Tax policy in a Commons vote being held by Labour tomorrow.

Instead the Tories and Lib Dems will back an unprecedented amendment which admits David Cameron and Mr Clegg are at loggerheads over the proposal to impose a levy on homes worth more than £2million.

Coalition split: David Cameron, pictured today leaving Downing Street, is opposed to an 'intrusive' Mansion Tax but Nick Clegg (right) wants the levy on homes worth more than £2million

This morning Lib Dem Business 
Secretary Vince Cable hinted he would back Labour’s motion which called 
for ‘a mansion tax on properties worth over £2million, to fund a tax cut
for millions of people on middle and low incomes’.

But he backtracked tonight, insisting he could now support the government line.

The coalition amendment, agreed just 
hours before the deadline set by Commons officials, states that the 
government has cut taxes for low and middle earners while ’at the same 
time increasing taxes on the wealthy, including raising stamp duty on 
expensive properties and restricting tax reliefs’.

But in a highly unusual move, it goes on
to admit that the governing parties cannot agree on targeting 
properties owned by the super-rich.

It ’notes that both parts of the 
Coalition continue to support tax cuts for people on low and middle 
incomes... [and it] notes the part of the Coalition led by the Deputy 
Prime Minister also advocates a Mansion Tax on properties worth more 
than £2million, as set out in his party’s manifesto, and the part of the
Coalition led by the Prime Minister does not advocate a Mansion Tax’.

A senior Lib Dem source said the 
compromise was an 'ingenious solution' because neither coalition party 
wanted to publicly back Labour in a Commons vote.

The Lib Dems want to target high value properties, like these flats in Knightsbridge, but have been rebuffed by the Tories

Mr Cable said tonight that the Lib 
Dems had refused to support a Labour motion 'designed exclusively to play
cynical party political games'.

He added: ’Parties should be judged on
what they deliver on fairer taxes, rather than what they say about 
them. In Government, Labour refused to back our mansion tax.

’In Government, Labour rubbished the 
Liberal Democrat policy of a mansion tax. In Opposition, they have 
simply copied it exactly in an attempt to fill in their blank piece of 
paper where original policies should be.’

But the move attracted ridicule from Labour.

Shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie 
said: ’It would be astonishing if the Liberal Democrats failed to back a
straightforward motion supporting their long-held policy of a mansion 
tax on properties over £2 million.

’The Liberal Democrats have a simple 
choice – either they back the policy they set out in their manifesto and
which Nick Clegg made the centrepiece of the Eastleigh by-election 
campaign or they don’t. No amount of wriggling or contortion can get 
them out of that simple choice.’

The Tories have remained implacably opposed to the idea of an extra annual tax on homes worth more than £2million.

Downing Street today said David 
Cameron and George Osborne believe the levy would ‘be intrusive, 
expensive to levy, raise little and the temptation for future 
Chancellors to bring ever more homes into its net would be 
irresistible’.

The Labour motion has been lifted from Lib Dem policy, piling pressure on Mr Clegg’s 57 MPs to side with Mr Miliband.

The Lib Dems want to target high value properties but have been rebuffed by the Tories.

The mansion tax was a Lib Dem 
manifesto commitment at the last election and is being advocated by Mr 
Clegg and Mr Cable in the current Budget negotiations.

It would involve an annual one per 
cent levy on homes worth more than £2 million. Owners would pay the tax 
on the value of their home above £2 million. Someone living in a £3 
million property would pay £10,000 a year.

But Downing Street warned Lib Dem ministers they could not vote for the Labour motion.

Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: 
‘The Prime Minister will expect, as always, Government ministers to 
support the Government in all votes.’

He added: ‘The Prime Minister's view 
(on a mansion tax) is the same as the Chancellor's, which he set out at 
the end of last year.

‘The Chancellor said then that it was 
intrusive, expensive to levy and raises little and that the temptation 
for future chancellors to bring ever more homes into its net would be 
irresistible.’

Asked if Mr Cameron had discussed the 
vote with Mr Clegg, he said: ‘They talk about a wide number of things. 
I'm sure they also discussed this, yes.’

Only this morning, Mr Cable, who drew up the Lib Dem policy on a mansion tax, hinted he was minded to vote with Labour.

He said he had not seen the wording of
the motion – which was published on Friday – but he would examine it 
before deciding how to vote.

‘We’ll certainly have a look at it,’ 
he told BBC Radio 4. ‘We did come to this five years go and we did set 
out the logic behind it and how it would practically operate and Labour 
had an opportunity in government to do it, didn’t do it, we’re now three
years into the next Parliament, they’ve finally alighted on it, and if 
it is a real commitment, I would certainly welcome that.’
