Seven people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of three young brothers who were found safe in Lancashire this afternoon.

Remus Matloch, 15, and his siblings Janko, 12, and David, 10, failed to return to their foster parents’ home in The Oakes, Sunderland, after going for a bike ride on Monday evening.

Donning helmets, they cycled to nearby Mowbray Park, before continuing on to Park Lane Metro Station and boarding a Metro train to Newcastle.

A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'All three boys have been found safe and well in the Lancashire area.'

The alarm was raised by their foster parents who were expecting them home at 8pm.

When they failed to return, their foster parents began to search the local area and then called police at 9pm to report the three boys as missing.

A spokesperson for Northumbria police said: 'As a result of enquiries, detectives from Northumbria investigating their disappearance discovered the location of the boys.  They attended an address and found them safe and well at around 2.30pm today, Friday, August 15.

'Officers are looking after the boys and will be bringing them back to the north east later today.

'They were found inside a house in Accrington, in Lancashire.'

Police have arrested seven people in connection with the investigation.

Two men aged 47 and 22 and a woman aged 23 were arrested in Lancashire this afternoon.

Two men were arrested on Thursday.

Home: The boys left this private road, The Oaks, on bicycle at 5.20pm on Monday, said Northumbria Police

Northumbria Police said the boys are expected to be returned to their foster parents as soon as possible.

Detectives from Northumbria travelled to London where they are questioning a 37-year-old man who has been arrested in the capital.

A 41-year-old man was arrested in Newcastle and is also been questioned in connection with the investigation.

IN addition, a 34-year-old man and 39-year-old woman have been detained in the West Midlands. Superintendent Alan Veitch, from Sunderland Area Command said: 'We are delighted that the three boys have been found safe and well.  We are planning to reunite them with their foster parents as soon as we can.

'We will need to speak to the boys over the next few days to piece together the full circumstances of what has happened, but of course we are just so pleased for them and their foster parents that this has been brought to a safe conclusion and that we have got the boys back.'

From Daljit Lally, executive director, wellbeing and community health services, Northumberland County Council: 'We are delighted to hear the children have been found safe and well. We’d like to express our gratitude to Northumbria Police for all their work over the past few days in finding the boys.'

Northumbria police detectives found the three boys safe and well in Accrington, Lancashire, this afternoon

Supposed destination: The three brothers, who were taken into care 18 months ago, told their foster parents they were going on a bike ride to Mowbray Park (pictured) in Sunderland. But the trio failed to return by 8pm

The three brothers, who were taken into care 18 months ago, knew they were expected back at their foster parents’ home at 8pm when they set off on the bike ride at around 5.20pm.

When they failed to return, their foster parents went out to look for them before calling the police.

CCTV footage shows the boys entering Park Lane Metro station, around half a mile from their home, without their bikes and helmets.

They were later spotted by cameras at Newcastle Central railway station - a 45 minute train journey away.

Distance: Mowbray Park was only a short distance from the boys' foster home in The Oaks, Sunderland

On Tuesday, Northumbria Police said they were concerned for the welfare of the boys as they have not been answering their mobile phones and have never previously gone missing.

Superintendent Alan Veitch said the brothers had been excited about an upcoming holiday this Friday and had very little money and no passports.

He urged them to get in touch and assured them they were in no trouble and officers could pick them up from wherever they are to take them home safely.

‘We are increasingly concerned for the boys welfare and we are appealing for anyone who may have seen the youngsters travel on the Metro from Sunderland Park Lane [to] Newcastle Central Station,’ he said at the time.
