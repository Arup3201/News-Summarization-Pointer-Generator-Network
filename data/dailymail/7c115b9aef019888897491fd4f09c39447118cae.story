This is the first picture of Pia Balotelli, the new baby daughter of firebrand Manchester City striker Mario.

The little girl was born earlier this month to his ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico, 27, and arrived three weeks early - she had been due on Christmas Day.

Balotelli has yet to see his daughter in the flesh and and is said to have only seen pictures of her via email.

In her first interview since giving birth Raffaella lashed out at the player for failing to act as a proper father.

In an interview with glossy Italian weekly Chi, Raffaella posed for several pictures with Pia, as well as her mother and brother Francesco, after securing a five figure deal with the magazine.

Chi is the same publication that printed pictures of a topless Duchess of Cambridge in the summer which were taken while she was on holiday in France with Prince William.

Furious Raffaella stormed: 'Mario for me is irresponsible. It came to a certain point where he was just not interested in anything, not in me or our daughter.

'Up until certain things happened he was supposed to marry me. That was our project, our desire.

'Then all of a sudden everything collapsed and I don't know why.'

Raffaella and Balotelli were an item for almost a year but split up in March after she flew to Manchester to confront him over a series of alleged affairs - the bust up was so furious that police had to be called to his Cheshire home.

Then in June during the European Championships, Raffaella contacted Balotelli to tell him she was pregnant with their child but initially he refused to accept it was his and demanded a DNA test.

Devastated Raffaella then hit back and said she had no fear of taking the test and her family rallied round her as it emerged she had also been contacted and urged to have an abortion - something the deeply religious underwear model ruled out completely.

Two months ago things appeared to be back on track when Balotelli issued a statement saying he was dropping the DNA requirement and that he would be 'trying again' with Raffaella and the two were pictured kissing on the balcony of home in Naples.

But despite his promise it quickly became clear he had no intention of doing the honourable thing as Raffaella confirmed that after he left her in Naples he failed to contact her in the following weeks.

Raffaella, who appeared on Italy's version of I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, described he moment she went into labour and rushed to the clinic.

'I sent Mario a text message at 3pm when the first contractions started and then again at 6.30pm when I went into the delivery room. I sent him another as soon as I came out and Pia had been born.

'But he only bothered to get in touch at half past midnight when my phone rang.

'I said to him "Mario, I've given birth" and he just said "Ah OK, I'm not bothered" and he then put the phone down. I've not heard from him since.'

'Mario's not even bothered about seeing his daughter - even if he doesn't want me to take a DNA test anymore I will do. I will make the results public so everyone knows Pia is Mario Balotelli's daughter.'

When asked if Balotelli had offered financial help Raffaella said: 'I have not had any economic help from Mr Balotelli.

'He is worth more than da Vinci's Mona Lisa but for his own daughter he hasn't flashed a penny. I have not even had a call asking if I needed anything. I don't need him or his money.'

However when asked what she would do if Balotelli did get in touch, Raffaela said: 'The door for his daughter is always open. The door of my heart is closed forever.

'I think when he came back to Naples a couple of months ago to see me that was just a PR exercise.

'Things then were not going well for him on and off the field.

'He doesn't have any paternal instincts. He is not even curious about his own daughter.'

Raffaella, whose previous boyfriends have included Cristiano Ronaldo, named her daughter after a mystical monk called Padre Pio who was famous for having bleeding wounds in his hands and feet exactly where Christ had them.

During the summer she made a pilgrimage to his shrine near Foggia where she was photographed in prayer in front of his statue with her mother and brother.
