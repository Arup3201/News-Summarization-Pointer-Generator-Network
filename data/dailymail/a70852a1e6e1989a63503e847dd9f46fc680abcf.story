A 12-year-oldgirl was shot by police with a 50,000-volt Taser.

The girl, who was  brandishing  two knives and threatening to harm herself, was one of more than 20 children shot by officers using the electric stun guns, figures show.

Police said the Taser was used to  detain the girl and ‘prevent serious harm to both her, the public and the officers’ after she began behaving ‘aggressively’ in St Helens, Merseyside, in July 2011.

Shocked: Around 24 young children have been hit with a 50,000-volt police Taser in the last three years - the youngest being just 12-years-old

Although the girl was unhurt in the 
incident there are fears that being hit with a Taser can increase the 
risk of  fatal heart attacks.

The schoolgirl was one of  more than 
20 children stunned with the weapons in the past three years,  according
to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.

They included six children aged 14, four aged 15 and 13 aged 16.

Scores of other children, some as young as 11, have been threatened with the weapons.

'Safety measures': At least 194 children aged 16 or under have had Tasers deployed on them to some degree in the last three years (posed by models)

In total, at least 194 children aged 
16 or under have had Tasers used on them in the past three years, 
according to figures uncovered by the investigative agency OpenWorld 
News.

Of these, at least 24 were actually 
shot by the Taser – a barb attached by a wire to deliver an electric 
shock of up to 50,000 volts.

  These details taken from police records explian the reasons why Tasers have been used on young people.

A
12-year-girl was shot in St Helens by Merseyside Police after she was 
said to have armed her herself with two knives and threatening to harm 
herself.

Two 11-year-old boys armed with knives in Crewe were targeted by red laser dots from a Taser.

A 14-year-old girl in Nottingham was accidentally shot as officers tried to arrest a suspect in the city.

A 14-year-old burglary suspect armed with a screwdriver was shot in Gwent, south Wales.

A 14-year-old was shot with Taser in Northumbria after the teen attacked another person with cosh - a truncheon-like weapon.

A
14-year-old was shot by armed officers in Warwickshire who was alleged 
to have been armed with a knife and 'being racially abusive'.

A 14-year-old boy was drive-stunned in York for resisting arrest.

A 12-year-old girl armed with a knife was red-dotted in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, by armed officers.

A 15-year-old was shot in Frome, Somerset, after an alleged assault.

A 15-year-old was Tasered in Nottinghamshire after apparently being violent towards an officer and carrying a knuckle duster.

Last night young people’s charities 
and human rights organisations said the use of Tasers on children was 
deeply worrying. The high-powered weapons should be fired on children 
only as a last resort, they said.

Amnesty International’s Oliver 
Sprague said: ‘In the United States more than 500 people have died after
being shocked by a Taser and, in many instances, the coroner declared 
the Tasers a contributory factor.’

Tasers are increasingly being carried
by British police after being introduced in 2004. Many officers on the 
beat can now carry the weapons after just a short training course.

At least six children were ‘drive-stunned’ by Tasers – where the electric device is held directly against the body.

Another 97 children were ‘red 
dotted’, with officers pointing the Taser at the child and pinpointing 
exactly where the barbs would hit their body with a red ‘sniper’ dot.

This included a 15-year-old targeted 
by Devon and Cornwall Police after he threw a glass at shop staff and 
took up a ‘fighting stance’ with his eyes ‘squinted’ as officers 
approached.

The use of the stun weapons against 
young children comes despite advice to the Home Office that Tasers are 
more likely to cause heart problems in children.

The advice, from independent 
scientific body Defence Sub-committee on the Medical Implications of 
Less-Lethal Weapons, was published in the Association of Chief Police 
Officers’ Taser guidelines.

It notes ‘children and adults of 
smaller stature as being at potentially greater risk from the cardiac 
effects of Taser currents than normal adults of average or larger 
stature’.

Penelope Gibbs, chairman of the 
Standing Committee for Youth Justice, a coalition of more than 25 
voluntary bodies campaigning for youth justice reform, said the findings
were ‘really shocking’.

‘The number of incidents indicate 
that the police are not using other techniques to calm potentially 
vulnerable or disturbed teenagers,’ she said.

A total of 27 forces provided 
responses on the use of Tasers against children during 2010, 2011 and 
2012. But the true figure of Taser use on young children is likely to be
much higher.
