Two shirts belonging to an Arkansas boy who went missing on Saturday have been found.

Authorities narrowed their focus to the water late Tuesday and called off the ground search for three-year-old Caleb Linn who disappeared over the weekend.

He had tagged along with his aunt and several other children to help clear storm debris from a bridge at the 900-acre Kia Kima Boy Scout Camp, which his aunt was looking after while the regular caretaker was away.

Desperate search: Caleb Linn, four, has been missing since Saturday from a boy scout camp in Arkansas

When five of the children left to go back to the cabin area around lunchtime, Caleb asked if he could follow.

His aunt told him he could, but that he had to stick to the road, Fulton County Sheriff Buck Foley said.

The last she saw of him before she turned around to resume her work, he said, Caleb was standing at the end of the bridge.

Caleb's great-grandmother Carolyn Truex said: ‘You want them to find him, but you don't want them to find him if he's in the water.’

Hundreds of volunteers have turned out since Monday to help in the search, and divers cleared debris and took underwater photographs beneath the bridge.

The weather since Saturday has been dry and unusually warm for March, lending hope to Caleb's chances of survival.

Relatives led the search, fighting their way along sandy trails and through thorny branches that would snap back with a thwack as the small group charged on.

At one point, they came across the tattered rim of a baseball cap near a wet patch that looked like a child's footprints. They called for help, careful not to touch what might provide answers about Caleb's whereabouts.

Word came a few minutes later: He wasn't wearing a hat.

One of Caleb's uncles, Joey Dawson, swam to a small island in the middle of the river, just in case Caleb was stranded there but found nothing.

Caleb, whose fourth birthday is 
next month, was among 11 children on the bridge at the camp, about 120 
miles northeast of Little Rock.

The children were not affiliated with the Boy Scouts but staying at the main campsite about half a mile from the bridge.

The Fulton County Sheriff's Office said state police, local law enforcement and volunteers were scouring the area near the Missouri border along the Spring River.

Sheriff Buck Foley said crews were clearing a log jam in the river near where Caleb was last seen.

The sheriff said: 'He was on the concrete slab of the bridge at the last place they saw him.'

Growing concern: Caleb Linn, four, was in the company of an aunt and uncle when he ran after older boys in his group to catch up and disappeared

Authorities had set a net downstream in case the boy had fallen into the river.

However it was possible the body could have passed that point before the net was put up, said Major Todd Smith, the assistant chief of enforcement for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.

'It's like looking for a needle in the haystack,' Smith said. 'There's no way to search the whole river.'

Smith said the river is clear but moving swiftly with water temperatures in the lower 60s.

Caleb is three foot, six inches tall and
weighs about 41 pounds. He has short brown hair and was wearing an 
orange jumper, orange short-sleeve T-shirt, blue jeans and 
black trainers.
