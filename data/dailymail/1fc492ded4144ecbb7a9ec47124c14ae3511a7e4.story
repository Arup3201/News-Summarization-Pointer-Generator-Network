His Honour Judge Hinkinbottom rejected the appeal

A failed asylum seeker and his 11-year-old daughter are demanding they must not be deported to France - because she would be banned from wearing the burka.

The Muslim father, 42, says removing them from the UK and forcing them to live across the Channel would amount to a breach of her religious rights.

France banned women from wearing the burka - the full body covering - and the niqab or face veil in public three years ago.

The pair arrived in France when fleeing from Iran in 2011. Britain is seeking to deport them and under EU rules they should go to the first country they set foot in.

The father, who cannot be named, said: ‘She loves to wear the burka. She already wears a burka during the weekdays, in the evenings and during the weekends.

‘She is very dedicated in following Islamic dress code and religious practices and values.

‘If we are deported to France she would not be able to follow her religious values and practices.’

He told the court he does not force her to wear the burka.

The case has already been rejected by the High Court in June this year but the pair have appealed and the Court of Appeal is set to hear the case within months.

Rejecting that appeal, Mr Justice Hickinbottom said the girl only wore a burka occasionally in public - and that in France she could continue wearing it in public.

The father, 42, who cannot be named for legal reasons, says the pair will face religious persecution and even imprisonment if his daughter wants to fully express her religious beliefs.

He claims he was forced to flee Iran with his daughter disguised, using false passports, because of his political views.

The family arrived in Britain from Iran after travelling to Turkey and then to France.

He says he travelled by coach to Turkey with his daughter and then flew to France before landing at Luton airport in July 2011, where he claimed asylum.

Their asylum bid was dismissed by the Home Office and passed to the French.

He told immigration officials the girl would ‘suffer’ greatly in France because she wears the niqab.

He said: ‘But what about my daughter’s school? She wears a cover but France won’t accept her at school. Mentally she will suffer a lot.’ After the Home Office rejected the asylum claim, immigration officers went to the family home in Derby, but father and daughter had vanished.

The case was then heard by the High Court.

Rejecting the case, Mr Justice Hickinbottom said: ‘Whilst I accept that she would at least at risk of prosecution under the 2010 law if she wore a burka in public in France, she does not wear the burka in public a great deal yet, she wears it occasionally.

‘In France she will be able to wear it in certain circumstances, at places of worship such as a mosque.

‘If she is prosecuted she will be able to take the human rights point to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.

He added: ‘Consequently, any potential affronty that the claimant or his daughter may potentially suffer to their dignity at the hands of the French state if they were removed there, would fall short of degrading treatment.

‘There is no evidence that those authorities are systematically unable or unwilling to address, determine and remedy any alleged breach.

‘Indeed, the evidence is quite to the contrary, namely that the French government and especially the French courts take their obligations in respect of human rights very seriously.’

In France women wearing a burka or niqab can be fined £125.

Other countries in Europe, including Belgium, Italy and Holland also have restrictions on religious dress.

Last month a British judge ruled that a woman could wear a full-face veil during her trial but must remove it while giving evidence.

However, she will still be screened from the court and only visible to the judge, jury and prosecution and defence lawyers.
