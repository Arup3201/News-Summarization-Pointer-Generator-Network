The Premier League giants may have returned home after competing in the Guinness International Champions Cup, but there is still one European powerhouse in the United States.

German champions Bayern Munich will be the latest European team to feature in the annual MLS All Star Game when they take on a team comprising the best players in the North American league in Portland on Wednesday night.

The 22,000 capacity Providence Park, home to the Portland Timbers, will host the latest contest between the MLS All Stars and an elite European side, which has become an annual showpiece for the league.

Last year, Roma were the visitors and the Italian side won 3-1. in Kansas City. In 2012, Chelsea were beaten 3-2 in Chester Pennsylvania while the two years before that resulted in dominant wins for Manchester United - 5-2 in Houston in 2010 and 4-0 in Harrison in 2011.

As is the case with All Star games across North America's four major professional leagues - NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL - the result of this match is not important.

For Bayern Munich, it is another 90 minutes during their pre-season campaign as they prepare for their Bundesliga defence. For the MLS, this is an event and a spectacle, one which will showcase the best players the league has to offer to the world.

Pep Guardiola's Bundesliga side have been greeted with thousands of fans in attendance at their open training sessions leading up to the game, further highlighting the growth of football in the US.

The World Cup saw record television crowds in the US as the country embraced Jurgen Klinsmann's team. Since then, the arrivals of the likes of Frank Lampard and David Villa, both of whom have signed for New York City, have also been announced.

The German champions are by far the stronger side on paper with their squad featuring six World Cup winners and the likes of Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski.

The list of former Premier League faces who will play for the MLS All Stars includes Thierry Henry, Clint Dempsey, Jermain Defoe, Robbie Keane, Tim Cahill and even the likes of Liam Ridgewell and Obafemi Martins.
