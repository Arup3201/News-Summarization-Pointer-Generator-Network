This is the horrifying image of a grimy shack which a young girl was forced to build before being held in it as a sex slave for 15 years.

The woman, who has not been identified, was repeatedly raped and brutally controlled from the age of 12 by a male relative who kept her imprisoned in the plywood shed with a single mattress at a home in Richmond, California.

Raul Ochoa, 52, was convicted on Wednesday after pleading guilty to one count of forced lewd acts on a child and two counts of forcible rape. As part of a plea deal, he will be formally sentenced to 22 years in state prison next month.

A woman, who was held captive from the age of 12 until 27, was forced to help build this prison shed where she was held by her captor and sexually abused

The plea deal was organized in part to save the victim the ordeal of having to testify.

Ochoa repeatedly raped the girl in the shed, as many as two to three times every week, stopped her from leaving the house and checked her cellphone.

She endured years of psychological and emotional abuse after she came to live at the home as a child.

During her  ordeal, Ochoa reportedly made the girl work for his landscaping business and home-schooled her. 

Raul Ochoa, 52, of Richmond, California was convicted of holding a young female relative as a sex slave at his home for 15 years

On one occasion when the girl was asked to dance at a family party by a boy, Ochoa dragged her home, forced her to strip in front of the family and burned her dress.

Contra Costa deputy district attorney Ryan Wagner said: 'Basically, her entire childhood was more or less stolen from her.

'He convinced her it [the shack] was going to be a place to watch movies together and a place for the family to hang out, but it turned into something much worse.'

The woman was held from 1998 until she escaped in August 2012 after being convinced to flee by her siblings. 

On August 16 two years ago, she told her captor 
that she was going to the restroom and ran from the home.

She was taken to
 Richmond police station by a waiting car.

Police were initially confused because the 27-year-old woman described herself as a runaway and wanted to go to another city.

After asking more questions, the officer quickly realized that the young woman, who was acting younger than her years, had suffered a horrifying catalog of abuse and mental torture.

Mitch Peixoto, the police officer who first interviewed the girl, remembered that she told him the story about her party dress.

He told mercurynews.com on Thursday: 'She didn't know that that was wrong. She spoke very matter-of-factly.'

Ochoa was arrested a short time later.

The shack has now been razed in the backyard of the California home where a woman was held as a sex slave for 15 years

'What this guy did to her for that long of a period of time was as horrific as I've seen,' DA Wagner told the San Jose Mercury News.

'She's an extremely courageous and strong woman. She was 
basically under emotional, physical and psychological abuse her entire 
childhood.'

'She felt she couldn't leave, and he would threaten that he would harm her or harm himself if she left,' the prosecutor added.

The district attorney said both the girl and Ochoa's
 wife suffered 'significant violence' at his hands.

It's not known if 
his wife and other children in the house knew the extent of the abuse.

'The wife was scared to death of him,' prosecutor Wagner said.

The
 Mercury News reported that Ochoa asked his wife if he could have sex 
with the girl years before the abuse started. When she refused, he 
apparently said that he was 'just joking'.

The shack where the sexual abuse took place has since been torn down.
