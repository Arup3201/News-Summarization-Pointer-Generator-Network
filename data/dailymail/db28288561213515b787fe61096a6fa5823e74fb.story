If you've always been plagued by a jittery grip when applying eye makeup, stick-on eyeliner could well be the big beauty trend you've been waiting for.

The innovative make-up creation first premiered at Dior’s couture show in July, where it was reported by Allure that the brand’s make-up artist and creative director Peter Philips hand-cut 70 pairs of metallic slivers to create a 'highly contrasting and artificial' look.

But now the trend has made its way onto the shelves, thanks to brands such as Dior, Lancôme and Violent Lips, all of whom currently offer a different version of the unusual accessory.

Silver mystery: Stick-on eyeliner tattoos made a splash at a Dior couture show in July, and are now available in a limited edition from the makeup company as well as others

A clean look: The silver design debuted by Dior has been hailed as futuristic, but the eyelids have to be free of oils or other makeup before applying

Unsurprisingly, Dior’s take on the trend doesn’t come cheap, with four pairs of stickers costing a whopping $61. Lancôme’s Hypnôse Velours Multi-Wear Eyeliner Patches are much more affordable, at just $25 for three pairs, while Violent Lips charges $6 per pair.

Designs feature a variety of colors and textures, including black or metallic, glossy or glittery and even velour.

While some reviewers admitted that the stick-on liners were tricky to master on the first attempt, many have raved about the temporary eyelid tattoos, praising their versatility and, in the case of the black ones, convincing looks.

Indeed, the only issue with the stickers seems to be that they usually have to be used alone, because other eye products can prevent them from sticking to your lids. But once they're in place, they'll stick around. 

No big commitment: more budget-friendly versions are also available, and are no more uncomfortable than a pair of false lashes

InStyle's tester almost gave up on her Violent Eyes Glitterati stickers, but, she wrote: 'Once I wiped my lids clean, the appliqués stuck, and they stayed in place until I peeled them off before going to bed.'

She added: 'People at the office kept asking me how I was able to draw such perfect lines!'

Though other styles can get expensive, they are also reusable, with Lancôme's Hypnôse Velours being capable of making the rounds three times before losing its glue, a Telegraph reviewer found. 

It also offers you three different shapes in one package, with upward and downward flicks for the more adventurous.

Falsies: The eyeliner stickers are often reusable and can be stuck on the lower or upper lids, or even around the eyebrows

Dior's limited-edition Mirror Eyes Multi-Wear Adhesive Eyeliner Patches, styled after the couture show versions, are also reusable and come with extra adhesive.

All the reviewers found their stick-ons comfortable, comparing them to false lashes that you can feel less and less over time. 

Ironically, they look best with a little help from the real thing: N.Y.C. makeup expert Troy Surratt. advised InStyle readers to 'place stickers as close to lash lines as possible, and use liquid liner to fill in gaps.'
