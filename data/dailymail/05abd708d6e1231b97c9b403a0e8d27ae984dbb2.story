'Fattitude'
 filmmaker Lindsey Averill didn't think twice when internet trolls 
sent her a mean email about her weight, or mocked her movie, but she 
never expected to get death threats.

She was 
told by fellow 'body-positive' filmmakers and writers that once she 
launched a Kickstarter for a doc on body image, she should 
expect her share of criticism.

'Fattitude's'
 film description calls it a 'feature-length documentary that exposes 
how popular culture fosters fat prejudice and then offers an alternative
 way of thinking.'

Internet trolls threatened filmmaker Lindsey Averill with rape and murder when she announced a documentary, 'Fattitude,' on body shaming

So far the film has made $32,862 of its $38,050 goal on Kickstarter, with 25 days to go.

Some
 of the backlash was harmless. There were people who told her her time 
would be better spent getting off the sofa and putting away the donuts.

She doesn't even touch donuts because of a gluten allergy, and exercises with a trainer three times a week.

'I can laugh at those people because [they] believe the stereotype that fat is a simple concept,' Averill, 35, told ABC News. 'It’s foolish. I’m going to help educate you by making this film.'

Averill's film has raised $32,862 of its $38,050 Kickstarter goal and she plans to include a mini-documentary on her harassment on the DVD

But it didn't take long for things to escalate from jokes about her eating habits to full-scale harassment.

Anonymous people began calling her home with rape and death threats. They ordered pizzas delivered to her home to show they had her address. They called her husband at work and extended their reach to people who appeared in the documentary and backers on Kickstarter.

'I didn't expect it to get this ugly,' she said.

A troll even took her video promo for the film, and spliced it with new footage to load on YouTube under the title: 'Cakes: The New Comedy Hit.'

That troll's edit was cut with racist, anti-Semitic and violent imagery.

Averill tried to get the video removed by filing a complaint for copyright infringement. The troll struck back, sending her a tweet telling her to retract the complaint 'or else.'

In a way, all the attacks did was help convince her the project was important.

While her own experience with online harassment won't be part of her finished film, she will likely include a short of the battles as a DVD extra.

'I really do feel like we do live in a culture that’s brutally cruel 
to fat people of all ages — children and adults alike,' she said. 'If 
you’re like me and you’re living in a fat body, no one should be mean to
 you.'
