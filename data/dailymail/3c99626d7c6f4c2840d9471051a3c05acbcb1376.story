Protesters at a potential fracking site boasted last night that police could do nothing to prevent them blocking all future attempts to drill for shale gas.

More than 1,000 hard-core activists took part in a day of action in Balcombe, West Sussex, yesterday and promised more demonstrations to stop other exploratory drilling by energy firms.

The campaigners’ defiance comes after the police were accused of giving into mob-rule last week when energy company Cuadrilla announced it would be scaling down its work at the site.

Police advised the firm that they 
could not guarantee protection for the site from incursions by 
protesters. As a result, Cuadrilla  temporarily ‘scaled back’ its 
operations.

The decision raised fears that – irrespective of the rights 
and wrongs of fracking – the rule of law was being flouted.

Now
environmental activists say that, despite security patrols around the 
drilling site and a barbed wire fence, they are  confident they can end 
the drilling altogether.

Veteran
campaigners from Manchester, Gloucestershire and Brighton joined a 
1,200-strong camp set up in a nearby field yesterday, marching from 
Balcombe railway station to the drilling site.

Police advised Cuadrilla to close the site after hundreds of people joined protests. Pictured, today's demonstration

Sussex Police said so far it has spent £750,000 policing the protests and is seeking help from the Home Office

Police
presence was stepped up to cope with the influx, with officers from at 
least ten other forces joining their Sussex colleagues. Total policing 
costs so far are said to be approaching £2million.

Protester Dan White, 19, was helping co-ordinate the action against the police with a walkie-talkie.

Describing
himself as a ‘professional protester’ he said it was the 14th 
demonstration he had funded through claiming benefits.

He added: ‘We’re 
winning as they’ve already halted the drilling and we can stick it out 
here until it’s removed altogether. ‘The police can’t handle us and 
don’t want to deal with it. This is a waste of the police’s money and 
their time.

'They can’t win as we outnumber them and it’s too large a 
space to contain.

‘They’re scared and I think they have got officers in from other parts of the country as the Sussex ones got on with us.’  

Protests (pictured today) have attracted support from Green politicians and celebrities such as Vivienne Westwood

Kae Skinner, a 55-year-old a business consultant from Tunbridge Wells, 
Kent, has been camping outside Balcombe for two weeks. She said: ‘The 
police can’t patrol it all the time and security will be lax around the 
drill.

‘There’s more of us than them. We will not be stopped.’

Fracking pumps liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas to be used as fuel.

Although
there are no immediate plans to use fracking at the site, the 
controversial technique could be deployed if fuel reserves are found.

Until now, police have enabled workers to continue drilling. But fears 
that hundreds more demonstrators could arrive this month prompted a 
re-think.

Protest organisers said they have forned a human chain around the Cuadrilla site

More than 45 
arrests have been made since the protests began near Balcombe three 
weeks ago and more than 30 people have been charged.

The
campaigners say they fear fracking will cause contamination of local 
water supplies and could cause localised earthquakes.

But David Cameron 
has insisted the whole country should accept fracking, claiming it will 
attract ‘real public support’ when the benefits, such as potentially 
cutting energy bills, are explained.

The
Prime Minister has argued that the process would not  damage the 
countryside and cause only ‘very minor change to the landscape’.
