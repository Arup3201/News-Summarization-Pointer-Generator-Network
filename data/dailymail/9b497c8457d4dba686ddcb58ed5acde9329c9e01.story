David Haye has laid the blame for the ugly brawl with Dereck Chisora in Munich last weekend squarely at his opponent's feet and said he'll talk to police to resolve the inquiry.

In a statement issued today from his hiding place somewhere in the UK, Haye claimed Chisora 'caused' the fight and 'some members of his entourage also encouraged the ruckus'.

He also said his departure from Germany with his trainer on a late-night flight before he could be arrested was an attempt to defuse the tension brewing between the two heavyweight fighters.

In the remarkable statement, 
reminiscent of the explanation for a schoolyard scrap, Haye said: 
'Chisora climbed down from the top table, removed his robe and then 
walked towards me, entourage in tow, in an aggressive manner.

'I held my ground, but, unfortunately,
he caused a serious disturbance to occur, something which threatened to
damage the reputation of the sport we both love.

'Regrettably, some members of his 
entourage also encouraged the chaos. Nevertheless, Chisora and I soon 
separated, brushed ourselves down and moved in opposite directions.

'The confrontation then reignited, 
however, and both Don Charles and Adam Booth became involved in the 
mess. Adam suffered a cut to the head.

'Thankfully, it didn't take long for 
the ruckus to again settle down. It was then that I heard Chisora say he
planned to "shoot me dead".'

The pair came to blows following 
Chisora's points defeat in a world title fight against Ukrainian Vitali 
Klitschko in Munich on Saturday night.

Cameras captured the moment Haye 
lashed out with a fierce right hook while holding a bottle which 
appeared to catch Chisora on the jaw.

Chisora, who threatened Haye by saying
he would 'track him down and shoot him', was arrested and released 
without charge but German police could not find Haye to question him.

It subsequently emerged that, after 
the fracas, Haye and his trainer, Adam Booth, rushed to their five-star 
hotel in Munich, packed their bags and set off for the airport before 
4.30am.

Haye returned briefly to his home and then left for a secret location, believed to be a country club.

According to Haye's statement, he and Booth's departure from the hotel was part of his efforts to 'diffuse (sic) the situation.'

He said: 'Chisora's team were staying 
at the same hotel as me and, in light of the threats Chisora had made in
front of the world's media, it seemed far more appropriate for me and 
Adam to leave the hotel as quickly as possible.'

Haye added that he was prepared to help boxing authorities with any investigation into the incident.

The scenes were described as 'ugly, 
horrible and disgraceful' and 'an embarrassment for British boxing' by 
Frank Warren, who represents 28-year-old Chisora.

But there were inevitable suspicions 
that the whole incident was a publicity stunt to whip up interest in a 
lucrative fight between the two Britons. It happened on Saturday night, 
after Chisora lost on points to Ukrainian Vitali Klitschko.

Haye, who had been commentating on the
bout for a boxing cable channel, became involved in a slanging match 
with Zimbabwean-born Chisora as they poured scorn on each other's 
record.

After Haye apparently hit Chisora 
while holding the bottle, catching him on the chin, Chisora shouted: 'He
glassed me!'

The two men then grappled and their entourages became 
involved in the melee.

Haye was seen trading punches with 
Chisora's trainer Don Charles before swinging a camera tripod over his 
head.

Adam Booth, Haye's trainer-manager, suffered a cut forehead and 
also claimed to have been 'glassed'. Chisora reappeared clutching a 
bottle but was wrestled under control.

Chisora and Charles were yesterday 
arrested at Munich Airport on suspicion of grievous bodily harm as they 
attempted to fly back to London, but were freed without charge.

Haye had left his hotel in Munich by 
4.30am, minutes before police arrived to question him. He returned 
briefly to his Beckenham, Kent, home before leaving for a secret location.

A 
spokesman for Munich police said: 'Given the events of Saturday evening,
a criminal investigation is required.'

Officers will present a file to prosecutors today recommending Haye be charged with affray, assault and threatening behaviour.  

If prosecuted he could face a jail 
sentence or a hefty fine, as financial penalties in Germany are levied 
according to income.

When former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher was 
involved in a punch-up at a Munich hotel in 2002, he was fined a total 
of £170,000.

Chisora has already been ordered to 
pay £31,500 to a charity for slapping Klitschko at the weigh-in, and 
spitting water at his brother Wladimir moments before the fight.

Claims of the post-bout brawl being a
publicity stunt were fuelled by a comment from Frank Warren when Haye 
began to goad Chisora at the press conference.

Warren was heard to say: 'I've got a 
great idea. If Dereck fights David, the winner fights Vitali.' 
Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente responded: 'Sounds like the perfect 
plan.'

Asked yesterday if the clash was a 
set-up, Warren said: 'If you think somebody wants to wind up getting hit
with a bottle and wind up in a police station while the other guy can't
be found... you've just got to be a complete moron to come up with a 
suggestion like that.'

'It wasn't me': David Haye pictured in training last summer ahead of his fight against Wladimir Klitschko

It is with regret that I feel I have to issue this statement to clarify certain matters, following an unfortunate incident that occurred on Saturday night (February 18) in Munich, Germany at the Vitali Klitschko vs. Dereck Chisora post-fight press conference.

I was in Munich to watch the WBC world heavyweight title bout between Klitschko and Chisora and provide punditry for BoxNation, and accredited as such.

During the post-fight press conference, I was stood at the back of the room. It wasn't until Bernd Bonte said my name and involved me in the press conference that I commented. I was then happy to banter back and forth with Bonte and Klitschko, keen to ascertain whether he (Vitali) would stay true to his word and reiterate his desire to do what his younger brother couldn't do - knock me out. I felt as though the public would want to hear more information about this potential bout and that we could both start beating the drum ahead of a showdown later this year.

However, at this point Chisora began firing insults at me from his position on the top table. In fact, he has recently made a habit of saying derogatory things about me in the press.

Moments before declaring he wanted to go face-to-face with me, Chisora assured the gathered media that he would give me 'two slaps'. Chisora had, of course, already been shrouded in controversy that weekend.

Despite this, Chisora climbed down from the top table, removed his robe and then walked towards me, entourage in tow, in an aggressive manner. I held my ground, but, unfortunately, he caused a serious disturbance to occur, something which threatened to damage the reputation of the sport we both love.

Regrettably, some members of his entourage also encouraged the chaos. Nevertheless, Chisora and I soon separated, brushed ourselves down and moved in opposite directions. The confrontation then reignited, however, and both Don Charles and Adam Booth became involved in the mess. Adam suffered a cut to the head.

Thankfully, it didn't take long for the ruckus to again settle down. It was then that I heard Chisora say he planned to 'shoot me dead'.

I decided to leave the venue and return to my hotel, a move which I hoped would diffuse the situation. However, Chisora's team were staying at the same hotel as me and, in light of the threats Chisora had made in front of the world's media, it seemed far more appropriate for me and Adam to leave the hotel as quickly as possible.

Consequently, I left Munich on an earlier flight on Sunday morning and have been thinking about what happened ever since, as well as replaying the incident many times via YouTube. It goes without saying, I am bitterly disappointed to have been a part of what transpired on Saturday evening.

I realise I am no angel - and don't mind a bit of professional trash-talk to help raise boxing's profile - but, during my 21 years in the sport, I have never been involved in, or even witnessed, such a serious fracas. If requested, I shall happily assist the boxing authorities with any investigation they wish to launch and, ultimately, hope that all lessons learned from this incident will be implemented.
