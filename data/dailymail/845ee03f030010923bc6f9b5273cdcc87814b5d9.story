The global ban on ivory trading should be lifted to stifle the recent surge in elephant poaching in Africa, the UN was told today.

If adopted, the proposals would allow the sale of ivory only from elephants that died naturally, were culled for ecological reasons, killed in a trophy hunt or because they posed a threat.

The international black market for ivory has risen rapidly since 2004 largely because of a growing Asian demand for ivory 
chopsticks, statues and jewelry.Â 

Ruthless, gun-toting gangs patrol the wilds of Africa, butchering elephants for their tusks before selling them on to Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese smugglers who make huge profits in their homelands.

Growing market: The recent rise in Ivory poaching has steadily worsened since 2004 thanks to a growing market in Asia

It is the first time such a proposal has been made since a global ban on ivory came into effect in 1989.

The proposal was put forward in a report commissioned by the 175-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, a treaty overseen by the U.N. Environment Program in Geneva.

'Given the present rise in illegal killing of elephants in West, Central and East Africa, it is clear that current measures are not containing the present upsurge in the illegal trade in ivory,' the report concludes.

'The tendency to ascribe this increase to the sale of stockpiled ivory in 2008 diverts attention away from the far more serious problems relating to the inability of African countries to invest in protecting their elephants.'

Big business: The rise has been driven by Asian demand for ivory 
chopsticks, statues and jewelry, right

Southern African countries, where the majority of elephants are, want some form of legal trade to help pay for their conservation efforts and sell off already growing ivory stocks.

Central and East African countries have in the past opposed any legal trade, fearing it will undermine conservation efforts and further bolster the illegal trade.

Environmentalists, too, have come out against the proposal because they argue that the reasons behind it - that legal trade would help reduce ivory prices, and thus demand - remain unproven.

Victims: The rise in rhino poaching will also be on the agenda with several measures to tackle the illegal hunting, mostly in South Africa

Also in the spotlight: In Asia, rhino horn has about the same street value as that of cocaine in the US. It is crushed and consumed by people in Asia who believe it can cure diseases including cancer, fever and even hangovers

The rise in rhino poaching will also be on the agenda with several measures to tackle the illegal hunting, mostly in South Africa.

It will address how better to regulate the trophy hunting trade and make greater use of DNA technologies to trace horns that are seized to help convict the poachers and traffickers.

A report by the World Wildlife Federation International found that Vietnam was 'the major destination' for rhino horns trafficked from South Africa, where 448 rhinos were poached last year.

In Asia, rhino horn has about the same street value as that of cocaine in the US.

It is crushed and consumed by people in Asia who believe it can cure diseases including cancer, fever and even hangovers.
