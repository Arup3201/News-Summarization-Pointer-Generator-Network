A Kenyan mother who gave birth to twin boys on Wednesday named her new-born children after the president re-elect and his defeated Republican rival.

Millicent Owuor, 20, delivered her twins, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, at a district hospital in the town of Siaya in southwest Kenya, according to Kenya’s The Standard newspaper.

Owuor told reporters that she had named her twins after the winning and losing presidential candidates in order to remember the day of the election.

Election enthusiast: Millicent Owuor, 20, holds her newly born twin boys named after U.S. President Barack Obama, left, and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, right.

Motherly love: Owuor rests with new-born children Barack Obama, left, and Mitt Romney, right, inside the maternity ward of Siaya District Hospital, near Obama's ancestral home village of Nyangoma Kogelo.

Owuor gave birth to her two boys a short distance from the village of Kogelo, where President Obama's father was born and where his 90-year-old step-grandmother, Sarah Obama, still lives.

Residents of Kogelo sang songs, danced and cheered “Obama, Obama, Obama!” after their candidate of choice dominated key states including Ohio and New Hampshire leading him to win another four years with his family in the White House.

Obama’s victory in the presidential race on Tuesday signifies fresh hopes for Africa, as many residents there see his re-election as a boost for Kenya-U.S. relations, Reuters reports.

At home Obama’s victory was quickly 
followed by renewed fears of a looming fiscal cliff and the worst day on
Wall Street so far this year. Stocks tumbled 200 points at the opening 
bell and the Dow closed below 13,000 for the first time since September 
4.

Africa responds: Kenyans celebrate the re-election of U.S. President Barack Obama at the sprawling Kibera slums of Kenya's capital Nairobi, on November 7, 2012.

Local coverage: A Kenyan man reads "The Standard" newspaper that headlines Obama's reelection.

Offering: A Kenyan resident holds a bowl of local porridge against a poster of Obama.

Obama defeated Romney in a tight win after months of intensive campaigning and heated debates over fiscal spending, the role of government and whether or not Romney had plans for a $5 trillion tax cut.

The president delivered a rousing 
acceptance speech and offered a promising vision of America’s future as 
he spoke to thousands of cheering supporters in his hometown Chicago.

'While our road has been hard, though 
our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought 
our way back and we know in our hearts that for the United States of 
America, the best is yet to come,' he said.

Romney acknowledged his loss and congratulated Obama in his concession speech on Tuesday night, saying he trusts the president's 'hard work and his commitment to principle will continue to contribute to the good of our nation.'

Hometown support: Obama addresses supporters at his election night victory rally in Chicago.

Farewell: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney waves to supporters at the Boston Convention Center in Boston, Massachusetts.
