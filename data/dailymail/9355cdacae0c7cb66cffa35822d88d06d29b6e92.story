A new restaurant is taking the term 'farm-to-table' to a whole new level by letting diners watch baby farm animals being born in a purpose-built birthing room.

At Farmhouse Restaurant in Fair Oaks, Indiana, customers are invited to visit a separate barn where live births happen every hour, with 80,000 baby pigs born each year and 150 calves born every single day.

And diners need not worry about the animals ending up on their plates; since it is only a dairy farm, the employees at Farmhouse get their meat and poultry from neighboring farms instead.

The restaurant, which is run by co-owner Carl Bruggemeier, sits on the 23,000-acre Fair Oaks Farms and boasts up to 500,000 visitors each year.

The goal of the birthing room, he says, is to expose people to where their food comes from.

'Most of us go into a grocery store and don’t really know where things come from or how they got there,' he told Today.com. 'We don’t even give it much thought.'

By contrast, more than 55per cent of the menu at Farmhouse comes directly from the farm, and Mr Bruggemeier says the eventual aim is for that figure to be 80per cent.

In the same vein, the restaurant kitchen is behind a transparent glass wall, so diners can watch while their meals are being prepared.

Some of the meals featured on the menu include a pork tenderloin sandwich, slow-cooked country short ribs and bacon-wrapped meatloaf.

Super fresh: The dairy they use comes straight from their farm animals

Not only does the restaurant take special care to keep their customers informed about the origins of their foods, but it is also entirely eco-friendly.

The facility runs on energy produced by cow and pig manure, or 'poo power' as it is dubbed on their website.

'Sustainability isn't just something we claim, it's how we live,' reads the site.

What's more, a visit to the farm is an experience in itself; tourists can explore a 7,000-tree fruit orchard, which provides much of the menu at the restaurant.
