Chelsea may have had six players named in the Professional Footballers' Association Premier League Team of the Year, but they still have some way to go to catch up with Manchester United.

The Reds top the table with 75 representatives in the best XI since the Premier League began in 1992, while champions-elect Chelsea are third with 29. 

Yet having Eden Hazard, Diego Costa, John Terry, Gary Cahill, Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic feature in this year's team has seen them close the gap to second-placed Arsenal, currently on 42.

Hazard was named the PFA Player of the Year on Sunday after becoming the poster-boy for Chelsea's push for their first Premier League title since 2010. The Belgium winger has remarkably featured in the Team of the Year every season since 2009 – for both Lille in Ligue 1 and Chelsea in the Premier League.

Being named in this year's best XI became Hazard's third in England, yet his hat-trick is nowhere near all-time leader Steven Gerrard. 

The Liverpool captain has eight to his name, but missed out on a ninth in his final Premier League season before leaving for Major League Soccer with LA Galaxy. 

Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez starred for Liverpool in last year's best XI when the club fell just two points short of the title behind Manchester City.

8 – Steven Gerrard

6 – Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Alan Shearer

5 – Rio Ferdinand, Roy Keane

Speaking of the defending champions, City are nowhere near their rivals. They have had just 11 players named since 1992 – the same as Leeds United – with only Shaun Wright-Phillips coming before Sheik Mansour's takeover in 2008.

As for their neighbours, David de Gea is the only representative from Old Trafford this year.

The Spain goalkeeper joins Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Denis Irwin with two, while Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs remain top with six.

With the list stretching back to 1992, we aren't short of blasts from the past. Andy Johnson was named in the PFA Team of the Year for Crystal Palace a decade ago, while Gary Pallister, Denis Irwin, Paul Ince and Eric Cantona all represented Manchester United the year after the Premier League was born.

David Beckham was named in the PFA Team of the Year four times for the dominant Manchester United

Thierry Henry has been named  in the PFA Team of the Year six times for Arsenal in the Premier League era

Even Portsmouth, currently 16th in League Two, feature twice with Glen Johnson and David James. 

There are also more than a few players who represent two clubs, including Robin van Persie, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Alan Shearer, Graeme Le Saux, David Batty and Roy Keane.

Current Premier League clubs who have never been represented in the PFA Team of the Year include West Ham, West Bromwich Albion, Swansea City, Stoke City, Leicester City, Hull City and Burnley.
