For girls struggling to navigate the latest apps on their iPad or browse their Kindle, help is at hand because a brand new Tablet just for women has been designed.

Developed by Middle East-based Eurostar 
Group, the ePad Femme is being billed as the 'world's first Tablet made 
exclusively for women' and comes complete with pre-loaded apps and even a pretty pink background.

The developers behind the $190 (£127) 
Android-powered ePad Femme are certain that women think Tablet computers
are too complicated so have created this to make the world of 
technology a less daunting place.

Only girls allowed: The ePad Femme is being billed as the 'world's first tablet made exclusively for women' and comes complete with pre-loaded apps and even a pretty pink background

It is packed full of ever useful apps such as: 'clothing size conversation', 'daily yoga', 'women's fitness', 'women's assistant (the logo is a scale wrapped in
a tape measure), as well as 'finest perfume for women, 'our groceries' and a whole host of recipes from Indian curry to yoghurt cannon.

'The tablet comes preloaded with 
applications so you can just turn it on and log in to cooking recipes or
yoga,' Eurostar's Associate Vice President for Marketing, Mani Nair, 
told The Media Line.

'It makes a perfect gadget for a woman who might 
find difficulties in terms of downloading these applications and it is a
quick reference.'

Useful apps? Built-in apps include 'clothing size conversation', 'daily yoga', 'women's fitness', and 'women's assistant (the logo is a scale wrapped in a tape measure)

In the same way that other products that have been 
unnecessarily doused in pink, such as the Honda Fit 
She's or Bic's Cristal for Her pens, the ePad Femme hasn't been on the receiving end of the best criticism.

The Twittersphere were up in arms regarding the latest launch with one user tweeting: 'The ePad Femme - because women can't work out tablets and are only interested in yoga, babies, cooking and shopping.'

Sharlene McGee added: 'The "first tablet for women" is as awful as it sounds'.

Speaking about the colour choice, Ali Saif Eddin, an electronics salesman, told Gulf News: 'It comes in pink because it’s for women.

'It’s quite fast selling because it’s unique. Women come in groups and buy two or three pieces and advise their friends to come.'

But according to what Eman Al Nafjan, a Saudi feminist blogger told The Media Line, that isn't quite the case.

Outrage: The Twittersphere are up in arms about the latest tablet and many brand it 'awful'

She said: 'There have always been special books for women concerning sex, how to please your husband, and what to cook for him. This is just using technology for the same thing.

'Whoever made this Tablet doesn’t understand us very well.

'Given the restrictions against women in parts of the Middle East, we are home all the time and we are extremely tech-savvy.'

In October last year, The Honda Fit She's launched.

Available in colours 
inspired by popular eyeshadow shades (yes, that includes pink), it even had a
windscreen that 'helps prevent wrinkles'.

The $17,500 vehicle also had an air-conditioning system that apparently improves the driver's skin quality.

A commenter on the Today.com article wrote: 'Am I a woman? Oh, yes, because I have a big pink car that reminds me that I am!'

Another wrote: 'I'm assuming it only 
comes with an automatic transmission, lipstick instead of a cigarette 
lighter, an illuminated vanity mirror in each visor... and the two 
remaining pedals (accelerator and brake) have been replaced with a tub 
to soak their feet.'

And Fujitsu also jumped on the bandwagon by launching a laptop designed solely for women.

The brand's Floral Kiss model was made by women, for women - its design concept of 'bringing elegance to PCs' developed primarily under the 
direction of Fujitsu's female employees.

According
to the press release, the small size and design of the model, as well 
as its accessories, mouse, and 'even its applications,' are ladylike, 
giving users inbuilt features like daily horoscopes, scrap-booking 
software and vents with a floral motif.

And when Bic unveiled a range of pens designed specifically for women, it fast became the most sarcastically reviewed product on Amazon.com.

Bic,
the ballpoint pen manufacturer, launched its 'Bic Cristal for Her' line in 2011, and it is unclear why Bic believes women need a specially-designed pen, though a product description on the site says it has a 'thin barrel to fit a women's hand', and an 'elegant design - just for her!'

The
product, which was available in an array of pastel hues, was being 
marketed in a serious way, but the ridiculous concept did not gone 
unnoticed by shoppers, with dozens of consumers posting hilarious remarks.
