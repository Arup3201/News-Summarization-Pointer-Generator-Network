Jailed: Shaun Colclough, 40, lured women to his studio with the promise of free photos 

A fashion photographer who previously raped an 85-year-old woman has been jailed for seven years for sexually assaulting two aspiring models.

Shaun Colclough, 40, lured the women in their twenties to his studio in Hackney Wick, London, promising he would help them improve their portfolio for free if he was allowed to use the images.

He had built a career as a legitimate photographer working with a range of fashion companies, but could not resist sexually humilating women.

Colclough used industry website Model Mayhem to look for girls who were unable to pay for photographs and were willing to do nude work.

During the photo shoots, which lasted for several hours, Colclough would ask the girls intimate questions, bully them into striking explicitly sexual poses and tell them to perform oral sex on him.

He tried to hug and kiss them on their arrival, and asking them to pose in every outfit they bought with them before telling them to strip.

When they refused to do open-leg shots he would try and force their legs apart, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

He refused to give the prints to another girl as agreed, and told her she would either have to pay £15 for a disk or give him oral sex to get the pictures for free.

Colclough tried to force one woman's legs apart and touched her vagina through her clothes.  

It led to five women complaining to the police but Colclough was only convicted of sexually assaulting the two women. 

He asked the second woman her if he could kiss her intimately before pinning her down. At one point he stood on top of her and forced his toes through her underwear.

Colclough was convicted of two counts of sexual assault but was acquitted of the other three charges.

During the trial it emerged that Colclough had previously served a six-year sentence for raping an 85-year-old woman in her own home when he was aged just 22.

He followed her home and attacked her in 1996, but was not caught until his DNA was matched to the crime in 2002.

Attack: When the models arrived at his studio inside this building in Hackney Wick, London, he would try to hug and kiss them before bullying them into posing in sexually explicit positions

The photographer admitted that the DNA match proved he had committed the offence, but said he had been extremely drunk at the time and had no memory of the incident.

Judge Sheelagh Canavan told him: 'You targeted these women on the basis that they were likely to be vulnerable and unlikely to stand up to you.'

The judge added he had completed a sexual offenders course in prison, and a second one when he was released into the community.

She said: 'You've had, if you were ever going to, the tools and opportunity to put your offending behind you.

'Your sexual gratification is, and I am sure always will be linked to the humiliation and degradation of women.'

Sentenced: Jailing Colclough at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London, Judge Sheelagh Canavan said his sexual gratification was linked to the 'humiliation and degradation of women'

She added: 'Your victims will have to live with the memory of what you did to them.'

She ordered that his hard drive, memory cards and tower unit be destroyed, but allowed him to keep his photography equipment. 

Three of the women who made allegations against him were present and one yelled at him as he was led out of the dock.
