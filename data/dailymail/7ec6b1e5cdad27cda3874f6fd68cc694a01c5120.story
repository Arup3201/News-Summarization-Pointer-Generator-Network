The Kremlin was accused yesterday of faking video footage of an alleged Ukrainian missile attack on pro-Russian separatists.

The apparent deception was seen as an attempt by Moscow to discredit the government in Kiev and provide a pretext for further Russian military action in Ukraine.

A sequence of images released by Russian military chiefs appeared to show a blazing rocket landing on a rebel-occupied block of flats in the Ukrainian city of Makiyivka, 15 miles from the regional capital Donetsk.

Original: The video of a failed launch of a Russian satellite-carrying rocket from the Baikonur space centre in Kazakhstan in July last year

Fake? TV footage, released by Russian military chiefs, with apparently superimposed buildings being 'bombed' 

The dramatic footage was broadcast by a TV channel controlled by the Russian Defence Ministry with a commentary accusing Kiev of indiscriminately attacking civilians.

According to Ukrainian authorities, however, the film was of the bungled launch of a Russian satellite-carrying rocket from the Baikonur space centre in Kazakhstan in July last year.

A photograph of the Proton-M rocket – which crashed during the failed launch – appears to have been superimposed on photographs of the block of flats in Makayivka to give the impression the building was under attack from a Tochka short-range ballistic missile.

The Ukrainian National Security Council said: ‘The trajectory and cloud of smoke of the rocket match the botched Baikonur launch.

'This video clearly demonstrates how the Russian propaganda factory... does not hesitate to distort the facts.’

There was no response from the Russians and the footage was later withdrawn from the TV station’s website. In a further heightening of tension, the Kremlin was accused of looting military equipment from Ukraine and taking it to Russia in lorries that Moscow had claimed were delivering humanitarian aid to the war-torn eastern region. Ukrainian border guards were not allowed to inspect the 227 trucks as they rolled back into Russia yesterday.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel flew to Kiev yesterday for talks with President Poroshenko and called for an immediate ceasefire.
