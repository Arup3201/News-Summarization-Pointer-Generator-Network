Britain's hopes of a white Christmas have been dashed as forecasters predicted cold and blustery weather with up to three inches of rain on the way.

The only chance of postcard scenes will come with frosts expected overnight on Christmas Day, but they'll be accompanied by freezing fog creating challenging conditions for drivers.

The nation was hit by strong winds and flash flooding today as the Christmas week began with a burst of bad weather which hit the transport network.

Planes were buffeted from side to side at Leeds Bradford Airport, while dozens of people had to be rescued from a supermarket when they were stranded there by rising flood waters and trains were cancelled across the country.

However, the rain is set to be replaced by clear and crisp conditions later this week - meaning there is little prospect of a white Christmas.

Bookmakers are offering odds of 12/1 against snow on Christmas Day in London, while the Met Office says the most that can be expected is 'sleety snow on higher ground', which is unlikely to settle.

Danger: The airport was hit by gusts which eventually forced the authorities to cancel many of the scheduled flights

Flash flooding hit Scotland last night, with dozens of people rescued from an Asda supermarket after the River Irvine burst its banks due to heavy rains.

In Kilmarnock, 42 customers and staff were ferried to safety in rigid inflatable boats after becoming stranded by floodwater at an Asda supermarket shortly after 6.10am.

Firefighters attended 11 flood-related incidents in Ayrshire as crews worked to rescue people and clear water from homes after heavy overnight rain. 

Apassenger was treated for a minor head injury after a train came to a halt when it hit floodwater near Mauchline in Ayrshire at around 12.20am.

Fire and rescue crews led more than 30 people to safety after the train became stranded in approximately five feet of water. Firefighters used ladders to create a three-metre bridge from a carriage, which allowed those on board to be led to safety.

The flooding has led to severe disruption to train services between Glasgow Central and Newcastle via Carlisle today.

At Leeds Bradford Airport, nearly all scheduled flights were delayed or cancelled because of strong winds which left planes visibly struggling to take off and land without being blown around.

A spokesman for the airport said that winds of up to 50 knots had meant that many flights had to be diverted to other nearby airports.

'The winds have affected the whole of Yorkshire,' he added. 'It is very frustrating for passengers trying to fly over the Christmas period, but we are hopeful of getting flights back underway later this afternoon.' 

Passengers flying via Gatwick were also hit by delays, after a signalling problem forced the airport's railway station to shut down temporarily, crippling the local train network.

Rail bosses said the the issue was fixed with 45 minutes, but had left a tailback of trains as they tried to regain normal services.

Those heading for cross-Channel ferries have also been held up today due to a broken-down train between Sandling and Folkestone West in Kent.

Also, staff shortages meant there were no Southern trains between Clapham Junction in south London and Milton Keynes Central in Buckinghamshire.

Cumbria Police warned motorists to adjust their speed due to deteriorating road conditions following heavy rain.

A number of roads in the county have reportedly flooded, particularly in the central Lakes, including the B5305 at Sour Nook, the A592 between Newby Bridge and Bowness, and the A591 between Rydal Water and Ambleside.

Other major roads around the country to be hit by poor conditions included the M62, where speed limits were lowered to 40mph due to strong winds which made driving more dangerous.

The Severn Bridge also faced speed restrictions due to the wind, as did the M6 in Cumbria.

Weather warnings were issued this morning ahead of showers which were forecast to dump three inches of rain in some areas despite the generally mild weather.

The thermometer was today set to reach as much as 12C or 13C in some parts of the country, according to the Met Office, with the South of England and Midlands the warmest areas.

But despite the unseasonably mild temperatures, Northern England and Scotland will be hit by at least 1in (30mm) of rain tonight and tomorrow. In the worst-affected areas, such as Cumbria, the Pennines and Snowdonia, 3in (80mm) is expected to fall by tomorrow night.

Forecast: Today and tomorrow will be rainy but clear conditions will arrive on Christmas Eve

Warning: Severe weather warnings are in place in northern England and the south of Scotland because of the rain and wind

Floods: The Environment Agency has warned of flooding across much of England, with the worst in the North-West

Fierce: This graphic shows how high winds are swirling around the UK and neighbouring parts of the north Atlantic

Severe weather warnings are in place across much of the North, while the Environment Agency has warned of the possibility of floods in Cumbria and parts of Yorkshire, as well as along the Severn Estuary.

After the rain clears tomorrow, it will be replaced by clear but much colder conditions, with the sun shining but temperatures as low as -2C.

On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, temperatures will climb no higher than 7C in most places.

'We will have colder and crisper weather for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day as well,' said the Met Office's Helen Chivers.

'You might see sleety snow on higher ground in the North of England and Scotland, but it will be dry with a fair amount of sunshine.'

Ladbrokes has lengthened the odds of a White Christmas in London to 12/1, with odds of 8/1 in Birmingham, 6/1 in Manchester and 3/1 in Glasgow.

A spokesman for the bookmaker said: 'At this stage there's more chance of Santa Claus coming down the chimney than the UK waking up to a blanket of white snow on Christmas Day.'

It has not snowed on Christmas Day in Britain since 2010, with extreme cold more often seen in January and February.

Forecasters are expecting frost overnight on Christmas Day, with freezing fog creating challenging conditions for drivers.

Wind and rain will hit the country from Boxing Day, according to Leon Brown of The Weather Channel UK, thanks to low pressure sweeping across Britain, with more showers over the weekend.
