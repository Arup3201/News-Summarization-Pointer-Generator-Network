Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren has revealed that everyone at the club was relieved after under-fire striker Mario Balotelli ended his goal drought against Swansea in their Capital One Cup win.

The 24-year-old had come under huge scrutiny for his performances since joining from AC Milan for £16million in the summer transfer window.

But the maverick forward showed signs of getting back to his best as he scored his side's equaliser against the Swans on Wednesday - only his second goal for the club - and Lovren has backed Balotelli to produce the goods over the long term.

Mario Balotelli scored only his second goal for Liverpool against the Swans in the Capital One Cup

He told Sky Sports: 'I think it's a relief for everyone but I was sure that Mario would score today (against Swansea) or tomorrow, so it was just a [matter of] time.

'Everyone has confidence in Mario, he's working very hard in training, so it will come with time.

'When you score a goal all the heavy weight that was on your shoulders [is lifted]…and I think now his time will come.'
