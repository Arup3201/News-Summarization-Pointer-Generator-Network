Three men who brutally beat a female family member because they thought she had been possessed by a demon have been convicted of assault.

Asma Hussain was tied to a bed, covered with holy water and beaten continually for almost eight hours after her husband, son and son-in-law became convinced she had the devil in her. 

A Muslim preacher was brought in to perform an exorcism ritual during which Mrs Hussain was held down and beaten with a cane.

Assault: The victim's son-in-law Muhammed Aziz (left) was also found guilty of taking part in the attack while a judge advised a jury not to convict her daughter Salma, 22, (right) who had also faced charges 

The husband Ahmed Hussain, 60, of 
Poplar, son Mohammed Kayes Hussain, 28, of Wapping, and son-in-law 
Muhammed Aziz, 21, of Bethnal Green, all east London, will be sentenced 
next month.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that on January 7 last year Mrs Hussain’s niece visited her home after being told she was ill.

Mohammed Kayes Hussain told her she had been possessed by a demon, a Yard spokesman said.

A short time later a neighbour arrived and saw Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Aziz holding Mrs Hussain down.

Mohammed Kayes Hussain was pouring 
water from a bottle over her face. The neighbour was told Mrs Hussain 
had the devil inside her and they were trying to get rid of it.

Later that day the husband of Mrs 
Hussain’s niece went to the address and saw an imam reading from the 
Koran and sprinkling holy water on Mrs Hussain.

After an hour of prayer the imam 
began hitting Mrs Hussain on the back with a walking stick, causing her 
to scream and cry out in pain.

Family: The victim's son, Mohammed Kayes Hussain (right) was also convicted, while the jury was advised to find her daughter-in-law Halima Khatun (left) not guilty

Mrs Hussain’s brother later visited the address having been told Mrs Hussain was unwell.

She said she had been hit - she was 
bruised and had blood running from her nose - and her son said she was 
possessed. The imam was again pouring holy water on her and striking her
with the walking stick.

The alarm was raised after another daughter of Mrs Hussain visited and called paramedics.

Mrs Hussain had been suffering from 
stress as a result of caring for her husband, and this was interpreted 
by the family as her being possessed, the spokesman said.

Detective Inspector Cliff Jones, from
Tower Hamlets police, said: 'The victim’s family apparently believed 
she had been possessed by demons which needed to be removed.

'This was a violent attack on a 
defenceless woman at the hands of the people she should have been most 
able to trust. It is right and proper that police carried out a full 
investigation and the courts have today convicted those involved in the 
incident.

'What happened to this victim was domestic violence.

'Despite extensive enquiries, the 
imam concerned has not yet been traced. Anyone with information as to 
his identity should call the community safety unit at Limehouse on 020 
7275 4756 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'

Mrs Hussain’s daughter Salma Hussain,
22, of Barnsley Street, and daughter-in-law Halima Khatun, 28, of 
Farthing Fields, were directed by the judge to be found not guilty 
during the trial.

Those convicted will be sentenced on October 18.
