A Beatles fan travelled across the country for eight years taking photographs of all 131 Abbey Road street signs in England. 

From rural lanes to inner-city estates and motorway sidings, Bryan Eccleshall, 48, crossed the length and breadth of the country to document each location where the famous street name could be found. 

The centrepiece of his collection is a picture from Abbey Road in St John’s Wood, London, made famous by the 1969 Beatles album of the same name. 

With over 130 signs across England bearing the Abbey Road name, the photographer Bryan Eccleshall had his work cut out for him in his successful attempt to capture every single one. Pictured is the most famous one in St John's Wood, London, taken September 2003

The iconic album cover for the Beatles album Abbey Road, taken outside the studio in which the album was recorded in St John's Wood, London. The album cover is said to contain cryptic messages about the band, with rumors including a long-standing conspiracy theory that Paul McCartney has been dead since 1966

Mr Eccleshall said inspiration for the project did not come from the iconic album cover, which features the Fab Four using the famous zebra crossing, but rather the Abbey Wood area near his home in south-east London. 

He said: 'I was living near an Abbey Road. I’ve been a fan of the Beatles since my late teens and to be living near to an Abbey Road - not the one made famous by the album, but a different one - tickled me.

'I began to wonder how many there were in England, and thinking about how the Abbey Road made famous by the Beatles is a "first among equals". 

'The thought inspired me to bring them together in a collection. I wondered if I could photograph them all.'

Mr Eccleshall from Worksop in Nottinghamshire started his project with the iconic Westminster Abbey Road sign in St John's Wood

Mr Eccleshall, a former publisher who is currently completing a PhD in Fine Art, set about visiting each Abbey Road in turn. 

Visiting
 around 16 locations a year, he would often make detours during 
cross-country journeys to provide opportunities to add to his 
collection.

He said: 'My partner was supportive 
and patient. All the trips were done without a sat-nav system so 
occasionally she would be the navigator. She didn’t mind adding time on 
to a journey so I could visit another Abbey Road.

'Towards the end of the project we had a holiday where we took a tent and did 11 sites on the South East coast in one week.

'Many of the Abbey Roads had features
 in common. The rural sites sometimes had ruins nearby - the original 
abbey from which the road took its name.

'Others were found on council 
estates, where the name was just a name and had no relation to the 
surrounding area. One Abbey Road actually turned out to be a motorway 
on-ramp. 

'It started out as mundane as
 trainspotting. But as the project grew, I noticed how the backgrounds 
became the focus of interest - the gardens, the roadsides, the broken 
walls.

'When you view the photographs together, it looks distinctively English.'

Mr
 Eccleshall, who now lives in Worksop in Nottinghamshire, drew the project to a close in 
October 2011 once he had ticked off every site on his original list.

He said: 'I’ve no plans to extend the search to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

'The famous Abbey Road is in England. The Beatles, the guys who made it famous, were English. To have covered England is enough for me.'

Mr Eccleshall used the 131 images to create a poster which has been purchased by Beatles fans from as far afield as France, Japan and the U.S.
