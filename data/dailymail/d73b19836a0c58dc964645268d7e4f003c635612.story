Many new revelations about J.D. Salinger have come out of a new documentary and biography about the author

J.D. Salinger's relationship with a teenage girl has been revealed as one of the key moments which led to the author's eventual retreat from public life.

On Tuesday night, PBS will air the documentary Salinger, the 200th installment of the station's American Masters series.

Director Shane Salerno's documentary, which he worked on for a decade, contains the first-ever interviews with a woman,
 Jean Miller, with whom Salinger formed an intense bond while she was a 
teen and he in his early 30s.

The author drew upon their relationship 
for his short story, For Esme - With Love and Squalor.

Mr Salerno told the AP: 'There are a few surprises I want to keep under wraps but here are some major changes.

'There
 is important new World War II material, including an extended version 
of Salinger's first day of combat, which was D-Day, and other brutal 
battles that forged him. World War II is critical to understanding 
Salinger. It was the transformative trauma of his life and is the ghost 
in the machine of all of Salinger's stories.

'There
 is a pivotal new relationship with a 16-year-old girl, which was a 
consistent pattern in Salinger's life, and viewers will learn how a 
betrayal in that relationship served as the first brick in the wall of 
silence Salinger built. One of the key participants speaks for the first
 time.

'The changes run throughout the film and provide a deeper understanding of Salinger.'

Jean Miller discussed her relationship with reclusive author JD Salinger after keeping silent for 60 years

Jean Miller had a five-year relationship with J.D. Salinger starting in 1949 and waited 60 years to discuss her time with the reclusive author.

After the author's death in 2010, Ms Miller finally opened up about the relationship to filmmaker  Salerno.

Miller was just 14 when she began the relationship with the secretive Salinger. According to CBS, Miller’s silence was a sort prerequisite to being a friend of Salinger’s.

‘I didn't want to talk about it because I knew [Salinger] didn't want me to talk about it,’ she said in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning last September.

Miller opened up about Salinger, for the first time since she last saw him 60 years before, to Salerno after the author’s death.

Among the intimate revelations - descriptions of Salinger’s spiritual nature and how deeply affected he was by WWII - was the disclosure that Miller had been just 14 when she met Salinger.

Miller says the two met at a Daytona Beach, Florida Sheraton hotel. Salinger was 30.

‘I was sitting at a pool, I was reading Wuthering Heights. And he said, “How is Heathcliff?"’

Despite warnings from her mother, Miller continued the relationship, which consisted of long walks on the beach and the exchange of many letters.

For five years, the friendship blossomed. Then, the two had sex for the first time and Miller would only see Salinger once more for the rest of her life.

‘I saw this glass curtain come down, and I just knew it was all over,’ she said.

But she still remembers him fondly.

‘He
 wanted to go below the surface of your life,’ Miller said. ‘Jerry 
Salinger would say to me, a young girl, “Do you believe in God?” No 
adult had ever talked to me [like that]. Not only that, no adult had 
ever listened to me.

'He once said to me, ''If you ever lose track of me, just read my stories.'''

JD Salinger's seminal work The Catcher In The Rye

No Salinger book came out after the early 1960s, as the author increasingly withdrew from public life.

The
 documentary is the third piece of the deal Salerno reached last year 
for a feature documentary, book and TV documentary about the late author
 of The Catcher in the Rye.

The PBS edition of Salinger runs 135 minutes, 15 minutes longer than the film released in theaters in September.

Salerno's movie and book, co-authored by David Shields, caught the attention of the literary world by providing extensive details of at least five possible new Salinger works, from more stories about the fictional Glass family to further reports on 'Catcher' narrator Holden Caulfield. (Salinger's publisher, Little, Brown and Company, has declined comment).

Mr Salerno told the Associated Press: 'There was universal agreement that the 
material I found was unprecedented, exhaustively documented and answered
 questions people have wanted to know for 50 years.

'As for Salinger, it's not the 
documentarian's responsibility to consider whether his subject would 
approve or disapprove of the work. I spent 10 years of my life on this 
because I was committed to getting it right and we did get it right, the
 truth is some people just didn't like what we found.

'I
 have enormous respect for Salinger as an artist but I reject the idea 
that he deserves an entirely different standard for biography than 
Martin Luther King, John F. Kennedy, Thomas Jefferson or Oskar 
Schindler.

'If you 
were making a film about any of those men you would tell the great 
accomplishments of their life as well as personal failures, and that's 
what I did with Salinger.'

He added: 'Some film critics 
criticized us for not examining Salinger's work in greater detail but 
there were strict legal restrictions that prevented that.

The 700-page 
book I wrote with David Shields is filled with literary analysis, while 
the film evokes viscerally for the viewer what it felt like to be J.D. 
Salinger during the most critical moments of his life.

'The goal of both 
projects was to separate the man and artist from the myths about him, to
 tell the real story of his life and to explore the cost of producing 
the kind of art that he did. I'm grateful that those who knew Salinger 
closely have said publicly that the film captured his extraordinarily 
complex personality.'

Besides Salinger, Mr Salerno has been busy working with James Cameron on the screenplay for the next Avatar movie
