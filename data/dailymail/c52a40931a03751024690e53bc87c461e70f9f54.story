A Texas family is moving to Colorado so they can administer marijuana to their three-year-old epileptic girl, who suffers 50 to 100 seizures a day.

Marijuana was legalised for recreational use in Colorado on January 1 this year, but Amber and Paul Loew, from Crosby, want to use the drug to help with their daughter Hannah’s condition.

She was diagnosed with a severe and progressive form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome when she was just six months old – and her seizures can last up to an hour.

Her parents will give medical marijuana to Hannah in liquid form, hoping it can sooth her condition.

Mrs Loew told KHou.com: ‘You’re living every day on the edge of your seat not knowing if you’re going to have to rush to the emergency room. There is no option to try it. It’s you jump in with both feet and go.'

She added: ‘This is not something where my family lives all over the United States. We live in Texas. This is our home, and we’re pretty much being forced to leave.’

Mr Loew, who's also father to a seven-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son, said: ‘It will work, and we have faith in that.’

The five members of the Loew family will be barred from re-entering Texas if they do treat Hannah with marijuana, as the drug is outlawed there.

Preparation for the marijuana retail market in Colorado started more than a year ago, soon after voters in 2012 approved the legal pot industry. Washington state has its own version, which is scheduled to open in mid-2014. Uruguay passed a law in December to become the first nation to regulate pot.

Pot advocates, who had long pushed legalization as an alternative to the lengthy and costly global drug war, had argued it would generate revenue for state coffers and save money in locking up drug offenders.

Still, setting up regulations, taxation and oversight for a drug that's never been regulated before took some time.

Colorado set up an elaborate plant-tracking system to try to keep the drug away from the black market, and regulators set up packaging, labeling and testing requirements, along with potency limits for edible pot.

The U.S. Justice Department outlined an eight-point slate of priorities for pot regulation, requiring states to keep the drug away from minors, criminal cartels, federal property and other states in order to avoid a federal crackdown. Pot is still illegal under federal law.

Police in the eight Colorado towns allowing recreational pot sales stepped up patrols to dispensaries in case of unruly crowds. Denver International Airport placed signs on doors warning fliers they can't take the drug home in their suitcases.

With the additional police patrols, the airport warnings and various other measures, officials hoped they have enough safeguards in place to avoid predictions of public health and safety harm from the opening of the pot shops.

Marijuana has been decriminalized since 1975 in California, when the state legislature passed a bill making the possession of the drug a $100 civil fine - not an arrestable offense.

In 1996, California voters passed a bill that legalized marijuana possession for medical purposes. Doctors are allowed to prescribe the drug to anyone with certain chronic medical conditions.

Californians with a prescription can obtain an ID card that allowed the poses, grown and consume the drug. 

Fifty-five percent of voters approved the measure at the time.

However, voters remain opposed to legalizing the recreational use of marijuana.
