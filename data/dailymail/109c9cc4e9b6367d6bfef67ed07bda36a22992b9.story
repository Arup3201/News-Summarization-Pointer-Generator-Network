Amazon has taken a gamble that its staff love working for the internet company by offering them the chance to leave for $5,000.

The Pay to Quit offer is made each year to staff, who can claim a payout and walk away from their positions in Amazon's fulfillment centers.

The web company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, says the payout gives unhappy employees a way out, which is good for staff and for Amazon.

Choices: Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos is offering to pay unhappy staff to leave

Once a year, employees in its vast warehouses where orders are packaged and mailed out, are sent a letter that begins: 'Please don't take this offer.'

As well as a quit option, the staff are offered the chance to claim up to 95 percent in tuition fees so they can take college courses for in-demand jobs - even if that means that in the long term they will leave the company.

Mr Bezos, who explained the policy to shareholders this week, said it encouraged 'folks to to take a moment and thing about what they really want'.

According to CBS, only a small percentage of the workers take up the deal each year.

Amazon, which employees more than 97,000 people around the world, adopted the idea for the Pay to Quit deal from clothing retailer Zappos, which it took over in 2009.

Forward-thinking company Zappos offers new recruits the chance to leave for a $2,000 pay off after they 
have completed a four-week training period, as a way to show how much 
they value staff.

Motivated: The Pay to Quit deal and an offer to pay for college tuition are being used to boost morale

Tony Hsieh, chief executive of Zappos, said that only 3 percent of the new recruits accepted the offer.

In the offer made to Amazon's warehouse staff, the amount available starts at $2,000 in the first year and rises by $1,000 each year until reaching a $5,000 cap.

Staff can also apply for funding to retrain, even if that means they will ultimately leave.

'We know that for some of our 
fulfillment center employees, Amazon will be a career,' Mr Bezos said.

'For others, Amazon might be a stepping stone on the way to a job 
somewhere else - a job that may require new skills. If the right 
training can make the difference, we want to help.'

The offer is limited to staff in the warehouse who have previously complained to Amazon about pay problems and claims that they are forced to work in an intensely hot environment.
