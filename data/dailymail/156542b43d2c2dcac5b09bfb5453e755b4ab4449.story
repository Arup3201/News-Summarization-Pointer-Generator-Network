Authorities have called off a desperate search for  an Australian and two Germans climbers missing on Mount Cook are believed to have died on New Zealand's highest peak.

Sydney doctor Michael Bishop, 53, and Johann Viellehner, 58, and his son Raphael, 27, were reported missing on Monday morning when concerns were raised after they failed to return from Aoraki/Mount Cook. 

Two helicopters were employed to search for the three experienced climbers on the 3724m summit, which they had planned to trek via the Linda Glacier route.

'The situation is grim. It was hoped that if they had survived the storm they would have been spotted from the air today,' police said in a statement.

'It is still unknown what has occurred to the men, but it is believed that they have perished on the mountain.'

Inclement weather hampered search efforts for the men on Tuesday and Wednesday, and approximately 30cm of snow has fallen at Plateau Hut with larger amounts settling higher up on the mountain.

David McKinley, from Alpine Guide, was the last person to see the group at about 4am on Monday morning. 

Mr McKinley, an experienced guide, ran into the trio at Teichelmann’s Corner on Linda Glacier and spoke with them about the unusually difficult conditions expected on the peak.

Dr Bishop started a men's support group which used 'adventure activities' such as rock climbing, hiking, mountaineering and cross country skiing to combat loneliness and depression.

'I did make them aware the temperature was quite warm and to be aware,' he said. 

'It did enter my consciousness later in the day when I didn't see them where I expected to, but it wasn't dangerous conditions for them to be out in,' he told stuff.co.uk.

The guide, who was also climbing the mountain, said he talked mainly to Mr Viellehner and his son. 

'It was just the type of conversation you have over a cup of coffee, but I got the impression from their preparation and gear they had some climbing experience,' he said.

Dr Bishop's son, Joshua, had hoped his father, who had been thwarted in two previous attempts to reach the summit, had been sheltering from the storm in a snow cave. 

'He has had many stories of being caught out on a mountain, having to build igloos or snow caves. He’s done it rough, he’s experienced gear failures and has had to make do,' Mr Bishop told The Daily Telegraph. 

'We are just having faith and trusting his experience, plus the fact he is with two other guys with great experience,' he said.

Dr Bishop was with Johann Viellehner, 58, and his son Raphael, 27,  on Monday morning when concerns were raised after they failed to return from Aoraki/Mount Cook

Mr Bishop said that the Ascent to Life ministry was a practical way to build self-esteem

Mr Bishop's son Joshua said he was hopeful his father was waiting out the storm in a cave

'I spoke to him on Christmas and he said he was flying out to Mt Cook for what he said was a perfect opportunity. He told me it was a very tricky climb.' 

Dr Bishop is a Christian pastor, as well as a doctor, and planted the Ascent to Life church in Blacktown.

He started a men's support group which used 'adventure activities' such as rock climbing, hiking, mountaineering and cross country skiing to combat loneliness and depression.

In a video for the program, Dr Bishop likened troubles in life to ‘struggling up a mountain,' to 'see the summit and wanted to reach it.' 

He said that the ministry was a practical way to build self-esteem, to teach people that 'there's a bigger picture- reach that summit, ascend to their life and get to the top of that mountain and see the great view from the top’.

The Christchurch alpine cliff rescue team has returned home and the Department Conservation rescue team is on standby at Mt Cook village.

Further aerial searches will be carried out in the following days in an attempt to locate the climbers bodies, as police say the search will be re-evaluated. 

More than 230 people have been killed in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, including 28-year-old Stuart Haslett, an experienced mountaineer, who died in a climbing accident on the peak.

In July, a 44-year-old Australian soldier was killed on Mt Cook after falling down a crevasse during a winter exercise.

78 people died while climbing Aoraki/Mount Cook, widely known as the spot where Sir Edmund Hillary honed his skills before teaming up with Tenzing Norgay to reach the summit of Mt Everest in 1953.
