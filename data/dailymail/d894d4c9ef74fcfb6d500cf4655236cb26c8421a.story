Alastair Cook ran with both arms in the air and a broad smile on his face as he enjoyed the acclaim of the Trent Bridge crowd and his team-mates. For one surreal moment all was well with the troubled England captain’s world.

Sadly, though, he had not just scored a long overdue century nor was he celebrating a much needed win. Instead he had just got Ishant Sharma out.

The fact that Cook was bowling, and taking his first Test wicket, the day after Jimmy Anderson had hit 81 in a world-record last wicket stand said everything about the conditions for this eagerly anticipated first Investec Test.

Pitching in: Stuart Broad has his (light-hearted) say on the state of the Trent Bridge wicket after the match

A horrible, frankly disgraceful, pitch
 was long destined to be the only winner and Cook had given up all hope 
of victory by the time he brought himself on for two filthy overs that 
even featured, a la Graham Gooch, a Bob Willis impression.

At
 least he could enjoy the moment when Ishant somehow tickled his less 
than medium pace down the legside to Matt Prior while the warm reaction 
of the England team emphasised that the skipper continues to have their full 
support.

‘I’ve got the match
 ball now,’ said Cook after claiming a souvenir of his unlikely bowling 
contribution. ‘That was my action in its full glory. I made a late 
decision to do a Willis impression. I’ve never ever done it before but 
Rooty was egging me on. I just tried to pitch my length up and keep the 
batsman guessing!’

These 
may be difficult times for the England captain but he is still smiling 
and still standing after eventually having the better of this draw and 
even glimpsing the possibility yesterday of what would have been a 
famous victory.      

For 
one glorious, cloudy hour on Sunday morning England could afford to 
dream of that precious and highly improbable win but the dust quickly 
settled on a stalemate that sees Cook with a wicket but without a 
victory in nine long Tests.

Only
 the pitch and the Nottinghamshire coffers emerged victorious from a 
draw that did little, other than during Anderson’s wonderful stand
 with Joe Root on Saturday, to enhance the appeal of the ultimate form 
of the game.

When Anderson 
and Stuart Broad, below their best this season, combined for their most 
productive joint spell of the summer at the start of the fifth day, 
three wickets fell for just 17 and India were suddenly under unexpected 
pressure.

The ball was 
swinging, Broad was on one of those rolls that have won Tests and India 
were only 145 ahead at the fall of their captain MS Dhoni to Liam 
Plunkett’s first ball with just four wickets left. Yet that was as good 
as it got.

It was a Broad 
charge that led to the brilliant win at Durham last year and a 3-0 lead 
in the Ashes which provided no hint of the extent of the misery that was
 just round the corner for an England side without a Test victory since.

This
 opening draw in one of the most congested five-Test series in history 
leaves England one short of their longest winless run for 21 years but 
at least Cook will have some crumbs of comfort to cling to as he heads 
to Lord’s.

Cook and England
 were staring down the barrel when they collapsed to 202 for seven in 
reply to India’s first innings 457 but they pulled this Test round in 
conditions that apologetic groundsman Steve Birks should be ashamed of.

What
 was Anderson saying about England being amazing hosts? Well, Sri Lanka 
and India have played on three pitches that could have been made for 
them while warm weather has done little to help England out of their 
trough.

All eyes will now be
 on the famously independent Lord’s groundsman Mick Hunt to see whether 
he can provide the pace and bounce that would not only provide a home 
advantage but also better cricket for long-suffering spectators.

How
 Anderson and Broad, who are in danger of being bowled into the ground 
this year, would love to see some life in the Lord’s pitch on Thursday 
but at least they will be cheered by their performances with ball and 
bat here.

There was 
also perhaps the best of Joe Root’s four Test centuries, decent 
contributions from Gary Ballance and Sam Robson and a fighting spirit 
that belies any suggestion of an unhappy dressing room to encourage 
Cook.

That is not to 
under-estimate the extent of England’s plight and Cook will need a win 
soon, or at least some runs, if he is to remain in office beyond the 
next four Tests which will come thick and fast. The odd wicket will not 
help his cause.

That win 
would have come on Sunday had Stuart Binny, justifying his existence in 
his first Test with 78, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar with his second half 
century of the match not come to India’s rescue as England flagged.

This
 was a much worse Test for Dhoni than Cook, the Indian captain following
 his appalling leadership during Anderson and Root’s stand on Saturday 
by missing a trick yesterday in not having half an hour bowling at Cook.

If
 Dhoni had declared once the draw was secured and dismissed Cook again 
India would have piled the pressure on him but instead they let the 
beleaguered England captain have the final word, improbably, with the 
ball.

England have added left-arm spinner Simon Kerrigan to their squad for Lord’s but it 
is hard to see how they can find room for him just yet without dropping 
Moeen Ali and that is surely out of the question.

Moeen
 may have been expensive here on a pitch which refused to break up but 
he ended up with four wickets in the match and while he is a work in 
progress with the ball he is the most promising of all England’s 
batsmen.

England do not seem
 far away from getting it right against a team now without a win in 15 
overseas Tests. But Cook knows that win has to come.
