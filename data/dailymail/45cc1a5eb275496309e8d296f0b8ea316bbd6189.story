'Not a rare occurrence': Patients admitted to Spanish hospitals at weekends are reportedly being given towels to use as makeshift pillows

Spanish hospitals are forcing patients to use towels as pillows because they cannot afford to clean bed linen every day, it has been claimed.

According to reports in Spain, patients admitted at weekends are being told to fold the towels to create makeshift pillows.

It is believed that linen cleaning has been outsourced to private firms in a bid to cut costs.

But those firms do not work Saturdays and Sundays leaving hospitals with a shortage of pillows.

A patient who was admitted to the Clinical Hospital in Valencia, eastern Spain, took a picture of a folded towel on the bed in place of a pillow and sent it to local news website LasProvincias.es.

Its report claimed that it was far from an isolated case with similar reports coming in from hospitals throughout Spain.

Sources at the hospital told LasProvincias.es that the situation was 'not normal' but that it was also 'not a rare occurrence' for a Sunday afternoon.

The source said that if the hospital was busier than it normally is at weekends then some patients would have to go without.

Austerity measures imposed by the Spanish Department of Health have also had a negative effect on Valencia's hospitals, said the source.

Patients are said to be expected to keep the same cutlery given to them on their first day for their entire stay.

Patients used to be given a glass of milk at noon, but that has now been banned due to cost cutting measures.

Last month thousands of health care workers took to the streets in 16 Spanish cities to protest against government budget cuts and plans to partially privatise the health care system.

Mariano Rajoy's centre-right Popular Party government is struggling to reduce the nation's deficit and avoid hiking taxes and widespread public cuts.

Unemployment figures in the country passed the five million mark for the first time in February.
