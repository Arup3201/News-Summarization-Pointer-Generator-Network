Before taking on a life of service, aspiring nun Mary Beth Baker is seeking a helping hand.

The 28-year-old has been accepted to a Tennessee convent, but can only enter once she's paid off her remaining student loan.

The Washington D.C. resident has until mid-August to find the $25,000 or forfeit her place with the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecelia in Nashville.

'You’re taken care of (at the convent) but you’re definitely not making money,' Baker told ABCNews.com.

Deadline: Mary Beth Baker, 28, can only join the convent in mid-August if she clears her remaining $25,000 student debt

Baker racked up a hefty debt while studying philosophy at Christendom College, a Catholic liberal arts school in Front Royal, Virginia.

While her Alma mater has forgiven some of her debt, she has been left with a significant sum to pay off in a short time.

Not one to sit on her hands, the young woman has turned to crowdfunding website FUNDLY, netting more than $5,900 in donations so far. From today, she has 57 days to raise the rest.

'I have two months to get there. Please also consider spreading the word,' she wrote.

'More than anything else, though, please keep me and the other young women who will be entering with me in your prayers. God bless you!'

It's no surprise that Baker has sought help online, following reports in 2012 that aspiring nun Nicole Ferko waited 10 years to join a convent while she paid off her $60,000 student loan.

Baker decided to become a nun last year, concluding that a life of prayer, poverty and 5am wake up calls suited her better than her PR job in Washington D.C.

She currently works as a senior staff writer at The Pinkston Group, and before that was an associate op-ed editor at The Washington Times.

The talented writer said she hit a low point in 2013 when work and dating no longer satisfied her, and began to pray about it.

'After
 a certain point I started meeting regularly with a priest who was 
getting to know me, and then he put me in touch with the sisters,' she told ABCNews.com.

'On my second visit, I was able to sit down and say, ‘This is my 
story and I’d really like to enter'.'

Pay off: Before joining the convent, Baker has to settle the remaining $25,000 of college debt she racked up while studying philosophy at Christendom College, a Catholic liberal arts school in Front Royal, Virginia (pictured)

After going through the application process, which included a 
physical and psychological evaluation, she received an invitation 
last week to join the convent.

'It’s
 a life of poverty and that’s the beauty of it. You embrace it,' she 
said. 'I’m incredibly blessed. Everyone has been very, very 
supportive.'

Before taking her leap of faith, Baker will sell her car and other belongings and quit her job.

'From
 there you have to get rid of everything you own, so I will slowly be 
giving away my library and my clothes and sell my car,' she said.
