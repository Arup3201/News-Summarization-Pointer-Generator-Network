Roma's players were the latest to face the wrath of angry fans following Thursday's capitulation against Italian rivals Fiorentina.

Serie A pundit Matteo Bonetti tweeted that Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport reported Roma fans had demanded players take off their kits as they weren't worthy of wearing them.

The Europa League had offered the last realistic chance of silverware this season to the Giallorossi following a miserable run of form, with the team falling 14 points behind Serie A leaders Juventus and at risk of losing second place to city rivals Lazio.

But Roma conceded three goals in the opening 22 minutes as Fiorentina completed a 4-1 victory on aggregate to book a place in the last eight.

Gonzalo Rodriguez converted a retaken penalty in the ninth minute, after a number of players encroached into the box for the first attempt. 

Marcos Alonso capitalised on a goalkeeping error to make it 2-0 in the 18th minute and Jose Maria Basanta headed in when unmarked four minutes later.

A late sending-off for Adem Ljajic for a second yellow card capped a dispiriting night which saw about a hundred of the club's Ultras leave the Stadio Olimpico after 30 minutes.

Roma captain Francesco Totti, goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis and midfielder Daniele de Rossi led the rest of the team's players over to talk to fans after match.

The scenes were reminiscent of the players of German sides Borussia Dortmund and Stuttgart apologising to their supporters following a dismal run this season.
