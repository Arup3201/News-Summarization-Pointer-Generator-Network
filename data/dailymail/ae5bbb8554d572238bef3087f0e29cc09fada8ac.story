Political junkies are chomping at the bit for the latest insights into Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick, and there was a glimmer of hope Tuesday morning when it was suggested that the public could turn to Wikipedia for answers.

A site called Tech President made a compelling case by arguing that interested parties could look at the number of recent edits made to the pages of potential nominees and use the volume of those edits as a gauge for how likely it is that said candidate will be Romney's choice.

The article examined the trend that started in the days leading up to the announcement of vice presidential candidates in the last presidential election: shortly before Sarah Palin and Joe Biden were revealed as their respective parties' vice presidential nominees, there was a major spike in the edits to their pages.

Frontrunner: Seen here with Mitt Romney today, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte (right) had the most edits on her Wikipedia page out of all of the potential VP candidates

The jump in that traffic presumably came from members of their campaigns who added more information to their profiles in the hours before their names were going to be searched thoroughly by Americans hoping to learn more about the candidates.

For instance, Sarah Palin's page had 68 edits the day before her nomination was announced, while other prospects- which, at the time, included Romney himself- had far fewer changes on that fateful day.

The activity increase was first noticed immediately after the Palin nomination, but today's article appears to be the first time that such analysis was applied to this year's crop of candidates.

Using the same barometer, a number of political bloggers looked to see if that same detail-specific timeline could give some insights into the upcoming Republican nominee selection process.

Trailing behind: Marco Rubio had 100 edits on Tuesday (left), Rob Portman had 81 (center) and Paul Ryan had 57 (right) putting them all behind Ayotte but the system of analysis is also flawed

While Senators Rob Portman and Marco Rubio have often been discussed as the frontrunners in the secretive race, they were outpaced- at least on Wikipedia- by Senator Kelly Ayotte on Tuesday.

The New Hampshire Senator, who has campaigned frequently with Romney in recent months, had a total of 153 edits made to her page by Tuesday evening, while Rubio followed with 100 and Portman with 81. Paul Ryan finished out the list with 57 edits.

Politico blogger Dylan Byers said that while he initially endorsed the validity of the veritable 'tea leaves' of Wikipedia edits, further inspection proved that a number of the edits were done by the same sources, not all of which were substantive.

Additionally, there is the ever-important aspect of context that has to be applied to the situation.

When Palin was added to the ticket, she was essentially unknown to all Americans outside of Alaska where she was part-way through her first term. As a result, it comes as no surprise that John McCain's campaign staff wanted to add a significant amount of information to her biography before putting her in front of the electorate.

Trendsetters: The system of looking through Wikipedia edits for clues came with Sarah Palin's selection in 2008 (above) but she also was less well-known than all of Romney's current candidates

The same cannot be said for Rubio, Portman or Ayotte, all of whom have been under the political microscope for the past few months in wake of their connections to Romney.

While the edit tally may not prove to be accurate guiding posts for the vice presidential slot, the Romney campaign continues to push for people to download their free app which will deliver the news first once it breaks.

Another tried-and-tested method would be to follow the money.

Politico reported Tuesday that Portman is expected to rake in over $500,000 for the Romney ticket from two Ohio fundraisers this week, which would be a positive argument in favor of his candidacy.

At the same time, Florida-based Republican Hispanic coordinator Ana Navarro Tweeted an anonymous tip that the Romney’s first joint appearance with his vice presidential partner will be in St. Petersburg, foreshadowing that the candidate is likely from the Sunshine State, (meaning Rubio).

It is likely that such rumor-mongering will go on for a number of days yet as many expect that the formal announcement won’t come until after the Olympics finish in order to make the best use of the inevitable media attention.
