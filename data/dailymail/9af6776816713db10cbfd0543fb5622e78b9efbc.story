Hundreds of cost-conscious football fans have found a cheaper way to attend the World Cup in one of Brazil's most expensive cities - camping by Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach.

Fans have been have been sleeping
 rough and cooking meals by the beach in a bid to avoid Rio's notoriously pricey hotels.

Although Rio has worked hard to shake off its reputation for violent crime and security is at an-all time high, the famous beach is still renowned for pickpocketing and robberies.

Hundreds of cost-conscious football fans have found a cheaper way to attend the World Cup in one of Brazil's most expensive cities - camping by Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach

Some of the fans have come prepared with tents and sleeping bags, although others are just sleeping on the sand

Most of them drove thousands of miles from other South American countries to support their national teams, avoiding expensive flights as well as Rio's notoriously pricey hotels

The largest contingent of supporters camping by the beach is Argentine, but Colombians, Chileans and Ecuadoreans could also be seen parking old cars, trailers and even small buses turned into rolling dormitories along Avenida Atlantica, one of Rio's most famous postcards

Some fans have travelled to Rio in camper vans and are spending the night in them to support their national teams and avoid expensive flights.

The largest contingent of supporters camping by the beach is Argentine, but Colombians, Chileans and Ecuadoreans could also be seen parking old cars, trailers and even small buses turned into rolling dormitories along Avenida Atlantica, one of Rio's most famous postcards.

The camping has become so extensive that now Rio de Janeiro authorities have promised to provide proper facilities for the World Cup fans campers.

Rio mayor Eduardo Paes opened up the gates of the Terreirao district used during the city's famed carnival in order to create a campsite for them.

'We want to receive tourists correctly with special attention for our South American neighbours who have driven enormous distances with family and friends to enjoy the World Cup in our city,' said Paes.

The 
establishment of camping facilities will give visitors access to toilets
 while municipal cleaning teams and police will also be deployed there.

But
 not all the tourists, who have in some cases travelled more than 4,000 
km (4000 miles) to Rio, are happy to have to leave their beach bolthole.

'Rio
 was not prepared to receive such a large scale event ... there are no 
chemical toilets, no spaces to park our camper vans. Now we are being 
moved on and they are saying if we don't comply they will confiscate our
 vans,' one Argentinian fan, Daniel Muller, told AFP.

Planning for the trip started years ago but travelling on the cheap was the only option to deal with Brazil's sky-high prices and Argentina's weak currency, which has lost about 20 percent of its value so far this year

Camping is usually not allowed on Rio's central beaches and cars must pay hourly parking fees in most of the city, but authorities have largely turned a blind eye to the presence of World Cup campers so far

A military police officer stationed near the Argentine group said it was the responsibility of Rio's municipal guard to take action. A nearby municipal guard said he would only intervene if the campers caused trouble

'We
 want to stay here. There is the Fan Fest and cultural interchange with 
fans from other countries. If this is about moving us 30km away from 
here then I'd have rather stayed in my own country,' complained Chilean 
Jonatan Tabia, a physiotherapist.

Emmanuel
 Estrada, 29, and Damian Perez, 32, took four days to drive a 1984 Ford 
Falcon Ranchero from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo for the World Cup's 
opening game.

'We
 will stay here until Argentina wins the World Cup. And certainly a few 
extra days after that,' Estrada, who works as a plumber in Buenos Aires,
 told Reuters as he sipped a cup of coffee he made himself, using a 
portable stove.

World Cup final on July 13.

'Our money is worth nothing here,' Perez complained about Rio, where a room for two in a dingy hotel can cost as much as $700 (£411) during the World Cup.

While 
their presence has annoyed some local residents, many Brazilians have 
welcomed them. Nor have they been hassled by police, several campers 
said.

Meanwhile, foreign visitors were pleased to see an extensive police presence in Copacabana.

'We feel safe here,' said Fabian Alvarez, a Chilean auto mechanic who drove over 5,000 km (3,107 miles) from Santiago to Cuiaba, where he watched Chile defeat Australia on Friday, and then to Rio on the following day.

Alvarez said he decided to sleep in his van after failing to find affordable hotels in Rio.

He plans to spend about one million Chilean pesos ($1,789, £1,051) during the whole trip, including on gasoline, food and maybe even one more World Cup ticket.

Echoing most World Cup campers, Alvarez said the trip was exhausting but he would do it again.

'It's all worth it. It's such an emotion when we sing the national anthem in the stadium. It gives me goose bumps.'
