Eleven-year-old Lucy Li took her bow at the US Women’s Open at Pinehurst on Thursday, resplendent in a stars-and-stripes outfit.

And the Californian junior, the youngest to play in a US Open  — men’s or women’s — could  hardly have got off to a better start, bagging birdies at the first and fifth holes.

Sadly, Li could not continue the fairytale and eventually slid to an eight-over-par 78 that left her some way off the first-round lead.

But she performed a whole lot better than American backmarker Xyra Suyetsugu, who carded an 88 — and she is 27.

Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy endured a torrid time with his wedge and putter at the Irish Open, recording a three-over par 74 that left him 10 shots behind first-round pacesetter Mikko Ilonen of Finland. ‘I was very sloppy with the scoring clubs today,’ admitted McIlroy, who revealed he had received a ‘great reaction’ to his decision to play for Ireland at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

‘I drove the ball beautifully again, putting myself in great positions, but I was not able to capitalise. Hopefully I’ll do a better job tomorrow.’

Rough patch: She was seven over-par after 16 holes, caught with a tricky shot on the 11th hole
