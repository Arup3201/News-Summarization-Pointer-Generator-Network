Michael Bloomberg has no doubts about where he's headed when he shuffles off this mortal coil - straight to heaven, according to the former mayor.

In an interview, published on Tuesday in the New York Times, the billionaire quipped that his liberal philanthropy - including his latest plan to drop $50million battling the NRA on gun control - should guarantee him a seat in the afterlife.

Bloomberg said: 'I am telling you if there is a God, when I get to heaven I’m not stopping to be interviewed. I am heading straight in. I have earned my place in heaven. It’s not even close.'

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is spending $50million to fight the NRA on gun control, said in a recent interview that his philanthropy as definitely earned him a place in heaven

Bloomberg announced this week that he plans to spend $50 million of his estimated $31billion fortune to build a grass-roots network to challenge the National Rifle Association and seek stricter gun control laws.

The billionaire plans to strike fear into the powerful NRA and persuade politicians who kowtowed to gun lobbies around election time that the anti-gun lobby was equally powerful.

The current groups he funds - Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America - will now be encompassed under an umbrella group called Everytown for Gun Safety.

The strategy will focus on expanding the background check system for gun buyers at the state and national levels.

Bloomberg told Today on Wednesday that he is not targeting Americans who want to hunt or protect themselves. Instead, he is advocating for a series of checks so that criminals, minors and the mentally ill do not gain access to firearms.

The group will focus on 15 states, including pro-gun territories like Texas and where gun control initiatives have advanced.

Michael Bloomberg appeared on Today on Wednesday with Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, to discuss their new campaign on gun control

It has set a goal of signing up one million new supporters this year.

When asked by Today presenter Savannah Guthrie whether his goal was simply to outspend the NRA, Bloomberg said that it was 'not a battle of dollars' but for the hearts and minds of Americans, to  protect our children. 

The NRA declined to comment.

When asked by Guthrie if he missed being mayor of New York City, Bloomberg, without hesitation replied no. 

He
 also nixed any suggestion that he would ever run for the White House, 
adding: 'I’m going to spend the rest of my life trying to make a better 
world for myself, for my kids, for my grandchildren.'
