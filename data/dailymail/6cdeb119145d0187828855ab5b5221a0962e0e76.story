It may not quite have the glamour or glitz of the latest Hollywood blockbuster, but this blurry footage of an engineer standing in front of a camera is likely to be the first film ever shot in America.

Revealed by GE and called 'Monkeyshines', it was created by engineers William Heise and William K. L. Dickson as they worked on the first device for viewing moving pictures.

They made the movie for Edison Labs in 1889 or 1890 while working with Thomas Edison to develop and test the Kinetoscope, an early motion picture viewing device considered to be the precursor to movie projectors.

The Kinetoscope is an early motion picture exhibition device designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window at the top of the device.

The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter.

First described in conceptual terms by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1888, it was largely developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892.

The full film, 56 seconds long, shows a lab worker 'horsing around' in front of the camera, and GE today released this animated gif version in tribute to the pair.

The shots are an experimental film made to test the original cylinder format of the Kinetoscope.

The films were intended to be internal tests of the new camera system, and were not created for commercial use, their rise to prominence resulted much later due to work by film historians.

However, film buffs have never been able to prove who America's first film star was.

Scholars have differing opinions on whether the first was shot in June 1889 starring John Ott or sometime between November 21-27, 1890 starring G. Sacco Albanese.

Both men were fellow lab workers at the company.

A series of three were made, before the team moved onto other projects.

All three films show a blurry figure in white standing in one place making large gestures and are only a few seconds long.
