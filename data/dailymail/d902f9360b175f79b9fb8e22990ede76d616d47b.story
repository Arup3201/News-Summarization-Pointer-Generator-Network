Passed away: Zac Knighton-Smith, pictured, passed away on New Year's Day

A boy who spent more than half his young life has died after a battle with the same rare brain cancer which killed his cousin.

Zac Knighton-Smith, nine, passed away on New Year's Day from an agressive neuroblastoma. He had been diagnosed with the condition in February 2009, aged four.

And just six months after the diagnosis his cousin, Chelsea Knighton, died from the condition aged three.

When he first fell ill aged four, two doctors missed the symptoms of his cancer.

It took six months to diagnose him as suffering from a form of the disease called neuroblastoma, which affects the developing nerve cells of children.

After chemotherapy at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2009, the NHS paid for Zac to go to Germany for a first time to have antibody therapy.

While there, doctors removed a tumour near his heart which, incredibly, his family had not even been told about.

Zac was given the all-clear, but a follow-up scan revealed three cancerous lymph nodes in his abdomen.

The NHS originally refused to fund potential lifesaving surgery at a German hospital for Zac, from Rushden, Northamptonshire, which led his family to start a desperate fundraising campaign.

They found the Â£8,000 needed for the operation, and were delighted to be told in March 2011 that Zac was in remission.

The family were also reimbursed the cost of the treatment by the NHS after Conservative MP Peter Bone intervened on their behalf.

Following intervention from their local Tory MP Peter Bone the NHS did a U-turn and reimbursed the family for the costly treatment.

But the cancer later spread to Zac's liver and he passed away at his home on 1 January alongside his parents, Bob Smith, 44, and Sam Knighton, 45.

His mother yesterday said he wasn't in any pain but confirmed his health had been ailing because the disease had spread to his liver.

Ms Knighton said: 'We took him to America as our last-ditch attempt in November to a specialist oncologist, who was also a scientist. We found out then it had spread to his bone marrow.

'We knew then that we had one hell of a fight. But at that point it wasn't in his liver. But that's the nature of the disease, it can happen that quickly.

'All over Christmas he deteriorated. We knew he didn't have long, he was poorly. Christmas will never be the same again.'

Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Bone said Zac will be 'greatly missed'.

Addressing Commons Leader Andrew Lansley in the chamber, he said: This lovely, full-of-life, happy little boy passed away. He will be sadly and greatly missed.

'However, without politicians of different parties working together he would not have had the last five years.'

Any funds raised by Zac's Fight Appeal, which has been raising money for his treatment, will now be used to help other children and their families fighting the disease.

Ms Knighton added: 'This country offers nothing for relapse neuroblastoma. If you take accidents out of the equation, this disease is the single biggest killer of children.

'How many more children have to die before something is done about it? This can't be allowed to happen.'
