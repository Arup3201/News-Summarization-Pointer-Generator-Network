With nine bedrooms, six bathrooms and a perfect view of Salisbury Cathedral, it can't have been a bad place to hide from the plague.

Now the mansion Charles II called home in 1665 after fleeing disease-ridden London is on the open market for the first time in its 600-year history - and if you have £5million lying around, it could be yours.

Grade I listed Malmesbury House is in Cathedral Close in Salisbury, Wiltshire, one of the most exclusive British streets outside London whose residents have included former Prime Minister Ted Heath.

Rumour had it King Charles would address the people of Salisbury from the safety of the projecting oriel window, while the great composer George Frideric Handel gave his first English performance in the mansion's music room.

The house was bought by the Harris family, a wealthy dynasty of politicians and diplomats, in 1660 and kept in their ownership for more than 300 years. Over the centuries they shaped the way it looks today - including commissioning an extension by Sir Christopher Wren, who designed St Paul's Cathedral.

The current owners, George and Jayne Apter, bought the home in 2006 from the wife of Conservative MP John Cordle, who had passed away two years earlier. Charlie Stone, from Savills, said: 'Owing to its rarity and historical connections, we expect strong interest.'

Princely: Malmesbury House, which Charles II called home for about a year in 1665 after fleeing plague-ridden London, is on the open market for the first time in its 600-year history - and could be yours for £5 million. The main house, spread across 7,638 sq ft, has a reception hall, drawing room, study and library

Country pile: The home was built in 1416 and, during the Civil War, was the home of Sir George Vaughan, the High Sheriff of Wiltshire who lived there while raising an army to support Charles I. In 1660 it was taken on by the wealthy Harris family, which shaped it into the house it is today including an extension by Sir Christopher Wren

Repairs: The current owners, George and Jayne Apter, bought Malmesbury House in 2006 from the wife of Conservative MP John Cordle, who had passed away two years earlier. At the time it had a leaking roof and several rooms were unlived in so English Heritage stepped in to help pay for the extensive restoration

History: It was in the mansion's music room that legendary composer Handel, a friend of the owner James Harris, is thought to have made his first English performance

Safe from plague: The oriel window (left) where Charles II (right) addressed his subjects as he hid from the plague that was sweeping uncontrollably across London. The next year, in 1666, the plague would be largely decimated by the Great Fire of London which, although it destroyed much of the city's history, claimed very few lives

Charlie Stone, from Savills, said: 'The Cathedral Close is one of the most desirable places to live in outside London. It is an urban setting, but it is the best of both worlds. It is country and town in one setting. I have sold a number of homes in the close, but the architectural quality of Malmesbury House's interior is exceptional'

Escape to the country: King Charles II fled London to escape the plague

When Charles II fled to the house in 1665, he was only doing what thousands of poverty-stricken Londoners would have loved to do.

The capital's slums were never free of the disease, but a hot summer in 1665 coupled with a sharp boost in population saw residents leaving more and more rubbish out in the streets.

Huge red blotches on the skin - perhaps better known as a 'ring-a-ring of roses' - would be the first sign of a fatal condition which spread like wildfire among the cramped conditions of the city's poor.

By coincidence, wildfire was exactly what did spread the next September when a bakery in the ancient timber-built city of London caught alight, sparking the Great Fire of London which raged for days.

Catastrophic though it was, it helped wipe out the plague. By the time it broke out Charles II had already returned to London from Salisbury in February 1666. After things were made safe, he travelled to address the 100,000 made homeless and declared the fire had been an act of God.

It was not the first time Charles II avoided disaster raging all around him. He escaped England during the Civil War in 1651 and remained in exile until the monarchy was restored almost a decade later.

In one incident during the Battle of Worcester, he and a colonel managed to evade angry parliamentarians by hiding all day inside a hollow oak tree at Boscobel House. It was since renamed the Royal Oak - as are countless pubs.

Domestic bliss: The kitchen is big enough to whip up a Baroque-era banquet. The house's price-tag is down to its location, size, architecture and history

Dream job for a gardener: The grounds, while not as large as in some country piles due to its urban location are still enough to play a good game of football... or croquet. Handel was a friend of James Harris III and the house is named after James Harris IV, who became the 1st Earl of Malmesbury in recognition of his diplomatic career
