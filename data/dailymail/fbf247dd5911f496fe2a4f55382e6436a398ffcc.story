A vicious hate campaign is underway to drive model Sylvie van der Vaart from her home in Germany.

Bullying neighbours apparently posted signs in the streets of the Hamburg neighborhood where she once lived with ex-Spurs star Rafael van der Vaart.

The 34-year-old model split with her husband in January, but stayed in the city so her six-year-old son Damien could be near the Hamburger SV footballer.

But she has revealed that she was horrified to learn that people who live near her have been posting signs attacking her laugh and her relationship status. 

The messages on traffic lights and cars along her street  read: 'There's not just nice 
people living in this neighbourhood but people who are fake and 
annoying. Their fake laughter can be heard a kilometre away.

'This particular neighbour. Terrible lady. Poor son - now that dad is no longer there.'

The Dutch model seems to be perplexed about 
the abuse telling German newspaper Bild yesterday: 'I cannot explain it. 
And I love Hamburg so much.'

When the interviewer suggested she move to Dusseldorf if the campaign carries on she replied neutrally: 'It is not easy to look into the future. But Dusseldorf is certainly a great city.'

But her former partner was
angered by the signs and The Sun reported he told the newspaper: 'It's an outrage. Sylvie 
doesn't deserve this. People can't do stuff like this.'

When the newspaper asked how she was adapting to life as a single mother she said: 'I still have time to do what I enjoy (smiles). For example, go to the hairdresser.. '

The blonde model and television presenter said that the former couple had 'a good relationship.'

'I am also very proud of him, that he was again selected for the national team,' she explained.

The former couple, once dubbed the new 
Beckhams due to their good looks and respective successful careers, hit the headlines earlier this year after van der Vaart publicly apologised for hitting his wife in a fight on New Year's Eve.

Van der Vaart told
Bild: ‘It was very foolish of me. I’m an idiot. I’m very sorry. It 
should never have happened.’

Sylvie told the newspaper that she forgave him, but the couple who married in 2005,  later announced they had separated.

According to Bild newspaper, Rafael said: 'I am very sad that it did not work with us. We are the culprits.'

'Sylvie alone and I have to answer for it, that our marriage does not work.'

Meanwhile
Sylvie is quoted as saying: 'We have unfortunately drifted apart over 
time. It was a gradual process that was not easy to stop. Even though it
sounds weird, we still love and respect each other.'

The split came just a few days after the 29-year-old footballer posted a snap of his family celebrating Christmas together.

In the picture he is seen sharing a warm embrace with Sylvie, with their son stood smiling in front of them.

In 2009 Sylvie revealed she was suffering from breast cancer and underwent surgery and chemotherapy to fight the disease.

Speaking
about being diagnosed at the time she said: 'All the luxuries in the 
world are no protection against that moment when you are told the 
diagnosis. Then you are just a woman.'

'For me, it was as if a bomb had gone 
off under our lives. Whether you are rich or poor, beautiful or ugly, 
young or old, cancer knows no boundaries.'

After
losing her hair Sylvie wore a wig, before her husband persuaded her to 
appear on the German version of Strictly Come Dancing without it.
