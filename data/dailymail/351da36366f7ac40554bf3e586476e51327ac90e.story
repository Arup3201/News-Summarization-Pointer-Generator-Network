Australian Mark Renshaw beat Team Sky's Ben Swift in a sprint finish to stage two of the Tour of Britain in Llandudno.

Renshaw, more used to working as Mark Cavendish's lead-out man within the Omega Pharma-Quick Step squad, jumped clear before the line to win comfortably as Swift paid the price for going too soon. 

After the climb of the Great Orme created significant splits in the peloton, Movistar's Alex Dowsett tried to break away to victory - challenged by Sylvain Chavanel (IAM Cycling) - but Sir Bradley Wiggins, working for Swift, led a group of chasers back on to their wheel on the approach to the line.

Swift then sprang forward but, with Cavendish not in contention, Renshaw covered the move and claimed the win.

'It was a great stage, a great victory, my first for the year with Omega Pharm-Quick Step,' Renshaw said on British Eurosport. 'It's always good to win, I've had victories here before on the Tour of Britain and it's good to do it again.'

The 31-year-old, winner of stage five of the Tour of Britain in 2011, will now take yellow from Marcel Kittel, who lost touch with the peloton on the Great Orme.

'It's great to be in yellow, it's a bonus,' he added. 'We came here to work for Cav but he had a really bad crash yesterday and is just trying to recover at the moment so he gave me a chance today and it's a really good victory.'

The 200.8km run from Knowsley Safari Park began with an early break of some 40 riders failing to gain any separation before a more select group - made up of Ian Bibby (Madison Genesis), Christopher Lawless (GBR), Lasse Hansen (Garmin-Sharp), Rob Partridge (Giordana) and Pablo Lastras (Movistar), soon joined by King of the Mountains leader Mark McNally (An Post Chain Reaction) - edged clear.

Their lead reached four minutes before the peloton began to reel them back in, and the last remnants were picked up on the Great Orme.

Dowsett tried to break off the front with two kilometres to go and led the way onto the final straight with Chavanel on his wheel, but the pack were closing in to set up the sprint finish.

Before the day's racing began, Sky lost Ian Stannard who withdrew with a fractured scaphoid suffered in a crash close to Sunday's finish in Liverpool.
