Six months after being sacked by Tottenham, Tim Sherwood revealed he is desperate to get back in to football, but said he won't be changing his management style.

The 45-year-old was replaced as Spurs manager by Mauricio Pochettino and has failed to find a job since.

Sherwood's passionate outbursts were a feature of his management style and, speaking to The Mirror, he claimed that will not change.

He said: 'I won't change. All I did was speak honestly after matches. I told the truth. But never – and I mean never – did I slaughter any individual publicly. It was always the team, never one player.

'Don't get me wrong – I would have had a word with players in the privacy of the dressing room if it was needed. But that stayed inside. I always spoke about the team. The ones who had given everything knew I wasn't speaking about them.

'Everything I did and said was for the benefit of the club. I will be back in football. I am determined about that.'
