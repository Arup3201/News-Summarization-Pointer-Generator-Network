Facebook has blacklisted the parish of Effin – for having an offensive name.

The social networking site would not let Ann Marie Kennedy list Effin in Ireland’s County Limerick as her ‘hometown’ on her profile page as it was deemed obscene.

Ms Kennedy contacted Facebook but received no reply, so tried to set up a group called ‘Please get my hometown Effin recognised’.

That was also rejected.

‘It came back with an error message saying 'offensive,’ she said.

‘It will recognise Limerick, but I’m from Effin. I’m a proud Effin woman.’

'It will recognise Limerick but I'm not from Limerick city, I'm from Effin.

'I'm a proud Effin woman.

'And I always will be an Effin woman.'

Facebook allows the word ‘effin’ in many group and profile names, but refuses to recognise it as a location.

Ms Kennedy, who now lives in Banogue, has now launched a campaign to have Facebook recognise the town and put it on the map.

A Facebook spokesman confirmed the company was looking into the oversight.
