A mother whose one-year-old daughter was killed in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing has spoken of her friendship with the firefighter who carried her dying child from the rubble.

Baylee Almon died in the devastating act of domestic terrorism at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995 where 168 lives were lost including 20 children. 

In one of the most iconic images to emerge on that terrible day, firefighter Chris Fields is seen gently carrying her tiny, broken body away from the scene. Baylee died a short time later.

Since the atrocity, Mr Fields and Baylee's mother Erin have become close friends. They appeared together to talk about their experiences on Katie Couric's talk show on Monday.

Mrs Baylee told viewers that after she saw the picture: 'I really wanted to meet him and thank him.'

The emotional fire captain's eyes filled with tears as he explained that it was still extremely hard for him to talk about that day.

However he added: 'Knowing I was the last one to hold her baby... I can look at it now and appreciate it.'

Captain Fields said that he had suffered
 from PTSD in the years after the Oklahoma bombing and attended 
counseling. He said that it was down to the support of his wife that he had not left the fire department.

Devastating loss: Baylee had just celebrated her first birthday when she was killed in the act of domestic terrorism

The firefighter has given 28 years service and plans to retire in the next three years. 

Mrs Almon, who has a 15-year-old daughter and ten-year-old son, runs The Protecting People First Foundation - a non-profit organization which she set up in her daughter's memory and which educates people in how to deal with both natural and man-made disasters. 

The Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people and left more than 600 injured.

Timothy McVeigh, who planted the fertilizer bomb, never expressed any remorse for his actions which he claimed were motivated by hatred for the government.

McVeigh was later convicted of placing the truck full of explosives in downtown Oklahoma and executed in 2001.

McVeigh’s Army buddy, Terry Nichols, was convicted on federal and state bombing-related charges and is serving multiple life sentences at a federal prison in Colorado.
