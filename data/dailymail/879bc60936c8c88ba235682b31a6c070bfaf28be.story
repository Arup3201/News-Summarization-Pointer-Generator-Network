Boris Johnson tonight tore into the UK Independence Party, warning a vote for the anti-EU party would hand election victory to Labour.

The Mayor of London burnished his Eurosceptic credentials, claiming people are twice as likely to be murdered in Brussels as in London – blaming Eurocrats ‘bumping off their husbands with poisoned profiteroles’.

But arriving at the Tory party conference in Manchester without the media hullabaloo seen in previous years, he appeared to go further than ever before in ruling out one day running for party leader.

Thumbs down: Boris Johnson rejected the overtures of the UK Independence Party insisting voters Labour could slip into power

Mr Johnson’s appearance at the Conservative gathering has become an tradition of media scrums, jokes and leadership ambition.

But with David Cameron’s position at the helm of the Tory party considered more secure, Mr Johnson’s appearance at a rally tonight was more low key.

Before addressing delegates, he used an interview with Bloomberg to go further than before in apparently ruling out rrunning for party leader.

He said: ‘I have no such plans.’ Asked clarify whether he still has ambitions to lead the Tories. ‘Ever, now, whenever.’

However, he did allow himself to take a mild swipe at Mr Cameron, mocking him for the photo posted on Instagram by his sister-in-law sleeping next to his red box.

The photograph was taken by Emily Sheffield as her sister Alice prepared for her wedding day and posted on Instagram, apparently not realising it could be seen by anyone.

The London Mayor delivered a typically erratic but joke-filled speech at the conference, where he revealed how he had rejected a request from Kirsten Farage, wife of UKIP leader Nigel, to address their party conference.

‘It’s time to lash myself to the mast and resist the siren song of Kirsten Farage, I said to myself, because with a general election less than two years away there is only one relevant fact.

‘And that is that her party would deprive me and everyone in my generation of a chance to have a vote on Europe in a referendum.

‘Because they would help to put Miliband in power, and I don’t to give back the economic management of this country to the people who were on the bridge when the ship ran aground.’

In a sustained attack on the Labour party, Mr Johnson withdrew his recent remarks claiming Ed Balls and Ed Miliband ‘belonged to the Costa Concordia school of helmsmanship’.

He added: ‘I meant the Titanic school of economic management, or the Amoco Cadiz or the Torrey Canyon or the Exxon Valdez.

‘Or whatever metaphor you pick to convey the scale of the most disastrous economic shipwreck of the last 50 years.’

Rejection: Mr Johnson revealed he had turned down an invitation to speak at the UKIP annual conference alongside Nigel Farage

He dismissed criticism from Labour’s Yvette Cooper making comparisons between crime rates in London and Rio.

‘After 5 years of a Conservative mayor, with common sense policies of putting more police on the street and increasing patrols we have the murder rate down to the lowest level since 1969, when Yvette Cooper wasn’t even born.

‘You are about 20 times more likely to be murdered in Rio as in London, about 4 times more likely to be murdered in New York.

Open door: Mr Johnson appeared to go further than previously in ruling out running for Tory leader

‘And you are more than twice as likely to be murdered in sleepy old Brussels where they have 3 murders per 100,000 as opposed to 1.3 in London.

‘Heaven knows what they are doing there – bumping off their husbands with poisoned profiteroles I expect.’

Mr Johnson insisted London is now the safest global city in the world which is why investors are flocking to the capital, drawn to the upgrades of the Tube and Crossrail.

‘We want to continue in London with that work, and we don’t want Labour with its 1970s blend of divisiveness and business-bashing and union control.

‘What is the definition of a millisecond? The time it takes Ed Miliband to follow the instructions of Len McCluskey..

‘What is the definition of a millimetre? The distance Ed will deviate from union diktat.

‘And I say to the charming Mrs Farage and her friends don’t vote for UKIP because we will see this country sleepwalk into a Labour government UKIP if you want to – David Cameron’s not for kipping not unless, obviously, he’s at his sister-in-law’s wedding.

‘My friends we are in a far better position than we could have dreamed; we can win the argument about living standards and show that we are the party with the serious policies to continue creating the conditions for a sustained and durable private sector recovery.

‘And we can show that this is the best way to spread opportunity, to generate jobs, to tackle poverty and inequality and to take Britain forward.

‘We won the argument in London in 2012, between short term fool’s gold and investment in our city; we are seeing exactly the same pitch from Labour in the country as a whole – and I have no doubt we can win in 2015.’
