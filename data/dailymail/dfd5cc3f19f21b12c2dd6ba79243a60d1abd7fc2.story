England look hell-bent on making no mistakes second time around when they face New Zealand at the Forsyth Barr Stadium this Saturday after their narrow yet proud defeat the week before.

Stuart Lancaster put his team through their paces days after their agonisingly close 20-15 loss to the All Blacks at Eden Park and his players show no signs of surrendering the three-Test series.

New Zealand won all 14 of their Test matches in 2013, becoming the first team in the professional era to do so, but were given a run for their money on Saturday by a weakened England side.

Training: Danny Care put through his paces ahead of Saturday's second showdown against New Zealand

Chase: Henry Thomas runs with the ball during the training session at the Onewa Oval on Monday

History: Kyle Sinckler trains with England, who have won just twice on the All Blacks' patch - in 1973 and 2003

Round two: England prepare ahead of the second of their three-test series against the All Blacks

Pass: Billy Twelvetrees back in training after overcoming an ankle injury that ruled him out first time around

England had practically been written off pre-match as they prepared to take on the All Blacks but escaped with pride intact, and then some.

They only went behind 10 minutes from time and will look to upset the script again by offering another tight, and often gruelling, match with their New Zealand counterparts.

England have beaten the All Blacks just twice on their own patch - in 1973 and 2003 - but look as close as ever to adding a third this Saturday.

And Lancaster will welcome his selection headache.

As well as those that gave a compelling account of themselves at Eden Park on Saturday, the England head coach has returning players to consider.

There are those such as Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees returning from injury that will look to earn their keep.

There is also the likes of Northampton flanker Tom Wood back in contention after taking part in the Premiership final that clashed with the first Test on May 31.

Close: Owen Farrell hopes to cause another upset - but this time with it ending in England victory

Working hard: Anthony Watson trains ahead of the second clash with New Zealand on Saturday morning

Preparation: Tom Wood (left) and Dylan Hartley (right) return to training after the Premiership final clash

Top team: New Zealand won all 14 of their matches in 2013 but England want to give them a dose of reality

Decisions: Stuart Lancaster must choose his side for the second test against New Zealand
