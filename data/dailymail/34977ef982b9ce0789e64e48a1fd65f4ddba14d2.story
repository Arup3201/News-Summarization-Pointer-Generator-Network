Game of Thrones fans were promised cheaper access to the show by Foxtel but the hit drama is not included in the new subscription deal to win over more customers and reduce illegal downloads

Foxtel customers now pay $45 instead of $74 to access drama, sport and movies

However, the minimum cost to buy into a pay-TV package which will deliver Game Of Thrones at the same time as it airs in the US along with a host of HBO quality shows is $45.

Previously it would have cost viewers a minimum of $74 to access the series.

However, considering Australians set a world record for file sharing downloads - with more than one million  accessing the show last season - the question begs is the reduced subscription enough to stop fans from illegally downloading? 

According to file sharing monitor TorrentFreak, Australia is the only country in the world to reach double digit downloads of the show with 11.6 per cent of GoT downloads originating here. 

Despite the show being a massive success - Foxtel only managed to hit the 115,000-175,000 viewers range - technically fewer viewers than for Peppa Pig on Sunday mornings.

Making Game Of Thrones cheaper to watch is not the sole reason behind Foxtel's revised pricing structure but it is the reference point for comparing the old subscription scale to the new one.

Foxtel CEO Richard Freudenstein said there has already been a positive response to their new pay structure.

There will also be more HD channels and the launch of an upgraded IQ box to allow viewers to watch shows that have been screened in the previous 24 hours.
