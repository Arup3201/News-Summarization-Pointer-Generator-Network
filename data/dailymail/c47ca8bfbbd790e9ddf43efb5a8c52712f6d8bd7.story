It's a world away from Berlusconi and his bunga bunga parties, but at least Tony Blair can always rely on an Italian Prime Minister to seat him next to some pretty girls.

Blair dined with his acolyte, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, and MPs during a private visit to Rome and looked thrilled to be seated between two of Europe’s youngest and most glamorous cabinet ministers.

Maria Elena Boschi, 33, Minister for Reform, regularly graces the cover of magazines such as Vanity Fair while Marianna Madia, 35, Minister for Public Administration, has drawn comparisons to Rossetti paintings.

Mr Renzi, who took office after making a ruthless power grab earlier this year, styles himself as Italy’s Tony Blair.

He has long held the former British PM as a role model, but last week the writer of the House of Cards series, Margaret Thatcher’s former chief-of-staff Lord Dobbs, counselled the Italian leader not to model himself too far on Blair.

He said: 'A good politician should be respected not loved…I suggest that Renzi put on some iron boots like those Thatcher wore and gets to work.’

Blair, wearing a grey suit and red tie, enjoyed a low key pizza night at Palazzo Chigi, the Prime Minister’s official residence. MPs and ministers shared pizzas and drank water or coke.

When the former politician paid visits to flamboyant ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi he was treated to serenades and a spectacular fireworks display with the words Viva Tony written in the sky. Cherie later described it as ‘the best night of her life.’

It is Blair’s second visit to Italy in recent months. Over the summer he enjoyed a family holiday with Cherie and two of his four children on the picture perfect island of Lipari popular with private yacht owners.

He has slid in popularity recently in Italy as he is currently advising on a highly controversial pipeline project to bring gas from Azerbaijin via one of Italy’s most pristine beaches.

The project is currently stalled after fierce local opposition as campaigners say it threatens marine wildlife including the endangered monk seal.

This week Blair was also embroiled in a furore, but over a charity award.

Save the Children faced a growing wave of protest as donors, volunteers and a celebrity ambassador for the charity condemned its decision to give him a high-profile anti-poverty award.

Angry former supporters took to social media to say they would be cancelling regular donations, and more than 100,000 people signed a petition demanding the charity withdraw the ‘global legacy award’.

The charity’s boss yesterday admitted the decision to honour the divisive former Prime Minister had created ‘global repercussions’ for its reputation.

Save the Children International chief executive Jasmine Whitbread sent a humiliating email apologising to staff for not consulting them about the award, saying they had been ‘blind sighted’. But she also issued a lengthy defence of the decision to grant it.

On Twitter comedian Dom Joly wrote that he was ‘pretty embarrassed’ to be an ambassador for the charity ‘when they hand out awards to Tony Blair for his “anti-poverty” work’, adding: ‘I can only assume they meant his own, personal poverty?’
