While Prince Charles enjoys record sales of his Highgrove-themed 
produce, things are not so perky for another of his pet projects, 
Dumfries House, the stately home in Ayrshire he saved for the nation.

The Prince stepped in to rescue the Palladian pile and its contents of 
rare Chippendale furniture when he formed a consortium to buy it for 
£45 million in 2007 without having set foot in it.

At the time, some advisers described the purchase as a ‘reckless gamble’
as it had to be funded by a £20 million loan taken out by his charity 
foundation.

Earlier this month, St James’s Palace proudly announced the loan for the
house — which used to be owned by the Marquess of Bute, former racing 
driver Johnny Dumfries — had been paid off.

But figures lodged at  Companies House show that the 18th-century 
mansion still has a long way to go before it is self-supporting, even 
though it is being run by the Prince’s former valet, Michael Fawcett.

Latest accounts for Dumfries House Trust Trading Ltd, which runs the 
shop and cafe at the house and hires out the building for private 
functions, show that it made gross profits of only £54,846 in the year 
up to the end of last March — down from £209,584 a year earlier.

With £97,542 of so-called ‘administrative expenses’, the company actually made a loss of £42,696 during the 12-month period.

The figures show overall turnover was £203,188, down from £270,724. But 
documents disclose things could be more rosy in the next accounting 
period, when the company will benefit from the income of a new 
bed-and-breakfast business and two self-catering cottages at Dumfries 
House  

All the income from the trading company is meant to go to a parent 
company, The Great Steward Of Scotland’s Dumfries House Trust, which is 
supported by grants and donations as well as an endowment fund worth 
more than £40 million.

Last week, I revealed how the Prince’s firm A. G. Carrick, which sells 
his goods at his three shops and on the Highgrove website to raise money
for his charity, had a turnover of £4 million last year, up on the 
£3 million in 2011.
