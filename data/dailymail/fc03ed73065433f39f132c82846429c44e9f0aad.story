A woman who ground her teeth so badly that she could no longer open her mouth, has had part of her jaw bone replaced with titanium implants to allow her to speak and eat again.

Toni Lovell-Clarke, 50, lost both her sandwich shop businesses after the recession hit, which caused her to grind her teeth from stress in her sleep.

At first, the grinding was only occasional, but soon the condition worsened and she developed muscle dystonia -  a neurological movement disorder, in which sustained muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements - which left her jaw jammed shut.

Dystonia is a medical term that describes a range of movement disorders that cause muscle spasms and contractions.

The spasms and contractions may either be sustained or may come and go.

Movements are often repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures.

Dystonia can affect one muscle, a muscle group, or the entire body.  It affects about 1 per cent of the population, and women are more prone to it than men.

Dystonia of the jaw is referred to as oromandibular dystonia.

Stress or fatigue may bring on the symptoms or cause them to worsen.

Treatment for oromandibular dystonia can range from antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications to Botox.

In rare cases surgery will be needed to replace the damaged bone.

She was left unable to eat, drink or even talk for months and needed to be given fluids through a tube.

But thanks to a rare type of surgery, Ms Lovell-Clarke, from Nottingham, had £16,000 titanium plates inserted into her jaw in an operation performed only around 75 times a year.

Despite a successful fitting of the implants, her troubles continued, as the dystonia dislocated the new jaw.

She was again forced to feed through a 
straw for four weeks after surgeons took the decision to wire her new 
mouth shut until the muscle contractions stopped.

Ms Lovell-Clarke has now credited her 
surgeon Andrew Sidebottom with turning her life around, allowing her to 
enjoy food and drink again as well as talk to her friends and family.

Mr Sidebottom said: 'The only way to stop
 this [the dislocation] from happening was by wiring her jaw shut for a long enough amount
 of time the muscles would heal.'

Mr Sidebottom, who has been a 
consultant at Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre maxillofacial 
department for 12 years, took 3D scans of Ms Lovell-Clarke’s jaw and 
skull and sent them to a U.S. company.

The firm was able to design bespoke 
jaw bone implants for her, which are made out of titanium and 
high-molecular polyethylene.

Ms Lovell-Clarke, a grandmother-of-five said: 'It was awful. I couldn’t eat or even talk properly - it was without doubt one of the worst things I have ever experienced, but I’m telling my story because was show my gratitude to Andrew.

'Andrew has turned my life around, I owe him a great deal and the work he does isn’t known about - he deserves a bit of credit.'
