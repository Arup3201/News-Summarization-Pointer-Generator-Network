With buttons, levers and flashing lights, this looks like a computer control room.

It is, however, just the computer. The Harwell Dekatron weighs 2.5 tons, contains 10,000 moving parts and can work without a break for 80 hours a week.

So what does it do? It churns out lots  of sums very quickly. In other words, it’s  a calculator.

The 61-year-old Harwell Dekatron (or the WITCH) computer has clattered back into action after gathering dust for 20 years

Weighing an incredible 2.5 tonnes, it was once voted the world's most durable computer

So called 'hand computers' or human workers who logged information by hand are recorded to have raced against the WITCH, but had to retire after half an hour, exhausted and defeated, while the computer ploughed on

The WITCH (left) weighs as much as around 15,000 iPad minis (right) and had a multiplication time of between five and ten seconds. Modern day computers work in less than a second

When it was built in 1951, this 
computer was a marvel of technology. Yet only a couple of decades later,
 the same processing power was available in something a little smaller. 
Pocket-sized, to be accurate.

But for its time, the Harwell Dekatron was highly impressive.

Capable of calculating sums with great
 accuracy 24 hours a day, it was based at the Atomic Energy Research 
Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire, where it was used for 
mathematical modelling.

The computer has 828 flashing 
Dekatron valves, 480 relays and a bank of paper tape readers. It can now be
 seen by the public at The National Museum of Computing

It was so advanced, it replaced a 
highly trained member of staff who had previously been number crunching 
on a clunking mechanical hand calculator. The Harwell used dekatrons – 
gas-filled counting tubes containing ten cathodes – for memory, similar 
to the RAM in modern computers. Paper tape was used for input and 
programme storage, and results were fed to a teleprinter or a paper tape
 punch.

It was a highly industrious addition to the staff – averaging an 80-hour week during one nine-month period from May 1952.

It was later given to a college for 
training purposes before it was consigned to a museum and eventually 
dismantled and put into storage.

The Harwell is being  switched on 
again today for the first time in a quarter of a century at the National
 Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire.

And once powered up, it will become the oldest original functioning electronic stored programme computer in the world.

The machine has been rebuilt by a team
 of volunteers led by museum trustee Kevin Murrell. ‘I first saw the 
Harwell Dekatron when I was a teenager in the 1970s,’ he said. ‘It was 
on display in the Birmingham Museum of Science and Industry and I was 
very fond of it.

‘When that museum closed, it disappeared from public view.

‘But four years ago, quite by chance, I
 was looking at some  photos of items in a storage centre and in the 
background I noticed the computer’s control panel.’  The Harwell, which 
was by then housed at Birmingham Museum’s Collection Centre, had been 
dismantled into 50 pieces.

But Mr Murrell was determined. He 
managed to locate around 99 per cent of the computer, which has 828 
dekatron tubes, 480 relays, 199 lamps and three miles of wire.

He and his volunteers spent  three years reconstructing the machine, using original circuit diagrams and photos.

The original designers were also tracked down for advice.

‘It is terrific to see it working 
again as I remember it so vividly from my teenage years and it is 
probably what inspired me to go into a career in computing,’ said Mr 
Murrell.

‘To see it in action is to watch the 
inner workings of a computer, something that is impossible on the 
machines of today. We hope it will now enthuse another generation of 
children.’

The computer was built and used at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from components more commonly found in a British Telephone exchange

Experts started building the machine in 1949, and the computer was in use by April 1951

The computer was built and used at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from components more commonly found in a British Telephone exchange.

Experts started building the machine in 1949, and it was in use by April 1951. 

It used dekatrons for volatile memory, similar to RAM in a modern computer, and paper tape for input and program storage.

It was by no means a 'fast computer'. It had a multiplication time of between 5 and 10 seconds, very slow for an electronic computer, even at the time.

But the design was noted for its reliability. In the period from May 1952 until February 1953 it averaged 80 hours per week running time.

Dr Jack Howlett, Director of the Computer Laboratory at Harwell between 1948 and 1961, said it 'could be left unattended for long periods.' 

'I think the record was over one Christmas-New Year holiday when it was all by itself, with miles of input data on punched tape to keep it happy, for at least ten days and was still ticking away when we came back.'

So called 'hand computers' or human workers who logged information by hand are recorded to have raced against the WITCH, but had to retire after half an hour, exhausted and defeated, while the computer ploughed on.
