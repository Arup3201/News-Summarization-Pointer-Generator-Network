Oklahoma City police have filed additional charges against a 49-year-old woman who stands accused of brutally abusing her 7-year-old granddaughter while dressed up as her alter ego - a witch called 'Nelda' as it's revealed her boyfriend allegedly taped it.

Geneva Robinson of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was arrested in October on child abuse charges after taking her unnamed granddaughter to the hospital, saying she 'could not control' the girl anymore.

Doctors reported that the girl was malnourished, and had bruises, burns and cuts all over her body.

Police say that they have identified another victim, Robinson's 7-year-old grandson, and have also pressed charges against Robinson's boyfriend Joshua Granger who allegedly taped the abuse.

Granger's abusive alter-ego was allegedly referred to as 'Crew Crow.'

WWLP reports that Robinson is accused of using scissors to cut the boy's fingers as punishment because he 'cut the hair of a doll.'

Court documents say cell phone video shows Robinson abusing the children, grabbing one by the hair and face and dragging a child across the living room floor.

Robsinson's granddaughter told a Department of Human Services worker that her grandmother regularly dressed up as a witch wearing a green mask, hat and robe, to abuse her.

She says Robinson would take her to the garage and make her sleep there on a pair on pants because 'she was in trouble'. 

Robinson allegedly used a dog leash to hang the girl from the garage ceiling by the armpits, telling her 'the creatures in the attic were going to come get her'. 

Koco reports that  after being arrested initially, Robinson told police, 'When I am Nelda, all I will say is all good girls and boys are in bed at night. Nelda's ghosts and goblins come out to get boys and girls in bed.'

The report also says Robinson burned her and hit her with an orange and black whip, and threatened to cut her with a knife.

When police searched Robinson's house, where she lives with three other children, authorities found the dog leashes and whip in the garage and the witch costume in the woman's bedroom.

Another child who lives there said Robinson picked on the 7-year-old, making her eat different food and sometimes alone in the garage.

All four children who live with Robinson have been placed in the protection of DHS.

An adult who also lives in the home, and wished not to be named, allegedly told police that Robinson also abused him as Nelda, and that she kicked him in the genitals on a regular basis. 

'It’s not true at all,' Joshua said, adding that the children who live there are troubled. 'She’s never dressed up as a witch to punish any of the kids.'

neighbors say they are shocked by the alleged abuse. 

'I have two children of myself. I couldn’t imagine doing that to my kids at all,' said Ruben Herreras, a neighbor.

'It’s scary. You don’t know what goes on inside the houses. You don’t know,' he added.
