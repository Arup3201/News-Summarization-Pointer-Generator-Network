Instagram is so awash with photos of food, the craze has even coined the term ‘food-ography’. 

And now a pop-up diner in London is taking advantage of this trend by letting people settle the bill for their meals simply by uploading photos of it to social networks.

The world’s first pay-by-picture restaurant, called The Picture House, opens to the public in London tomorrow before heading to Manchester and Leeds next month.

Scientists claim taking a photo of your food before you eat it makes it taste better.

Researchers from Minnesota claim photographing food puts people in the moment and in doing so, heightens their senses.

The person taking the photo will, on some level, feel the difference creating an incentive to continue the practice.

The data also revealed that a longer delay between ritual and consumption bolstered these effects.

These findings contradict a study from researchers in Utah that found looking at too many pictures of food can make it less enjoyable to eat.

This is because looking at pictures of what is on a plate can make people bored with their meal before they've even taken a bite.

The Picture House has been opened to mark the launch of a new range of meals from Birds Eye. 

Each diner will be served a two-course meal, and if they upload photos of the food to Instagram, Twitter or Facebook using the #BirdsEyeInspirations hashtag, they won’t have to pay.

Diners at the pop-up restaurant at the Ice Tank in Soho will also be given tutorials from food photographer Marie Marte. 

The opening follows research by Birds Eye that found over half of people (52 per cent) regularly take photos of their meals. 

One in ten (11 per cent) admitted to taking at least one snap of their meal time moments every week, with nine per cent admitting to not being able to go a day without snapping a picture of one of their meals. 

According to Webstagram there are currently over 90 million pictures using the hashtag 'food' on Instagram.

Furthermore over a third of Brits (39 per cent) purposely arrange food on their plate with the intention of sharing it online, and over a third of Brits (34 per cent) take pictures of food to express their creativity.

The Picture House restaurant forms part of Birds Eye's 'Food of Life' campaign, which celebrates real food and the way real people eat and interact at meal times. 

Birds Eye marketing director, Margaret Jobling said: ‘Taking photos of food enables people to show off and to share their meal time moments - from the everyday to the very special.

'We wanted to tap into this trend and create a new reason for people to talk about and sample our Inspirations range.’
