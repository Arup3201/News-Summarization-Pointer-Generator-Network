A former University of Virginia lacrosse 
player, sentenced to 23 years in prison for beating to deathÂ  his 
ex-girlfriend, launched an appeal today.

Attorneys for George W Huguely V filed a petition with the Virginia Court of Appeals on Tuesday arguing that constitutional and procedural errors entitle the 24-year-old to a new trial.

Huguely, of Maryland, was convicted of second-degree murder in the May 2010 slaying of 22-year-old Yeardley Love.

Appeal: Convicted killer George Huguely V's lawyers said he was not given a fair trial in documents filed today in Virginia

Yearbook: Yeardley, 22 at the time of 
her death, and ex-boyfriend Huguely had just broken up when he admitted 
to breaking into her dorm and shaking her aggressively so that her head 
slammed into the wall

She was found dead in her Charlottesville, Virginia bedroom where Huguely confronted her after a day of heavy drinking.

The petition argues that Huguely was 
denied the right to his chosen lawyer, the right to a fair and impartial
jury and other violations.

Virginia has 30 days to respond to the petition.

George W. Huguely V was sentenced on 
August 30 last year after Miss Love, from Baltimore, was found face down
in her blood-soaked pillow on May 3, 2010.

Authorities
said the 24-year-old defendant left his on-again, off-again girlfriend 
to die after he kicked a hole in her bedroom door and physically 
confronted her about their sputtering two-year relationship. Police said he had been drinking heavily that day.

The jury found the Maryland man guilty last February of second-degree murder and grand larceny. The defense had sought a 14-year sentence, which was disregarded.

The final decision came after a lengthy court battle, which included testimony from Roman Catholic priest Rev. Joseph Scrodo who said that he had visited Huguely weekly in jail since the May 2010 slaying of Miss Love.

Self-inflicted: Huguely told police after her death that Yeardley banged her own head against the wall

The priest he said the 'wild, out-of-control' person that Huguely has been portrayed as is not the man he knows.

Earlier, prosecution witnesses described Huguely beating a man who went home with Miss Love after a party. A woman also testified he angrily put his hands around her neck.

Huguely and Love, both seniors and varsity lacrosse players at UVA, had a volatile relationship that spiraled into Huguely's deadly confrontation with Love late on the night of May 2, 2010, after a day of heavy drinking and golfing by Huguely.

Love was found the next morning, her battered face in a blood-soaked pillow.

In a police interrogation video played at his trial, Huguely admitted he and Love had a physical confrontation over their on-again, off-again two-year relationship but he denied inflicting the fatal injuries Love suffered.

He said she had banged her head against her bedroom wall.

A coroner concluded she died of blunt force trauma.

Love's death followed several months of tension between the two young athletes. Former teammates and friends testified that each accused the other of infidelity and they described incidents of Huguely's escalating drinking.

The grand larceny conviction stems from Huguely's theft of Love's computer from her apartment.

Talented: Yeardley was a star lacrosse player at the University of Virginia and was just weeks away from graduating when she was murdered

Support: Sharon Love, mother of Yeardley, and 
sister Lexie Love, far left, leave court last year

Threat: Prosecutors told the jury that Huguely sent Yeardley Love (centre) an email before she died saying: 'I should have killed you'

Love's mother, Sharon Love, has filed two lawsuits seeking nearly $60million. One is aimed at Huguely while the other claims U.Va. and athletic department officials and coaches ignored Huguely's drinking and violent behavior.

Huguely was arrested in Lexington in 2008 after a drunken confrontation with a police officer.

Love's death has had a lasting impact in Virginia and at the university. It's easier now for abuse victims in Virginia to get a restraining order and students must tell the university if they have ever been arrested.

School officials and students also have tried to make the culture on campus one in which people look out for each other and aren't afraid to report relationship violence.
