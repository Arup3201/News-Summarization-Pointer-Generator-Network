An artist is showing nowhere is safe from terrorism - as Sylvanian Families are invaded by MICE-IS.

Fluffy hedgehogs, rabbits, foxes and bears can be seen sitting down for a picnic on a grassy hill in Sylvania while evil jihadists lurk in the background.

The bad animals are dressed head to toe in black with masks covering their faces, just like in the series of videos released by the terror group.

Two can be seen clutching guns while a third is brandishing a knife - Jihadi John style - while a koala on a scooter holds an Isis flag.

The artist behind the creations wanted to use the children's classics to parody the murderous group.

She has used the pseudonym 'Mimsy' to protect her identity and 'avoid any possibility of beheading' - suggesting she doesn't take the satire lightly.

The second scene shows a classroom full of the furry creatures looking at equations on the blackboard while the menacing figures can be seen creeping into shot through the windows.

Although a different terror network, the scene is bound to evoke thoughts of the Pakistan school massacre by the Taliban late last year.

A skit mocking Isis, produced by American comedy TV show Saturday Night Live, caused backlash in the US with many taking to social media to say 'Isis is not a joke.'
