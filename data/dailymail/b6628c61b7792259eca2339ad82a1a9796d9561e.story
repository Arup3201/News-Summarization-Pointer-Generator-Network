As they stood on the field after their historic fourth Super Bowl win, two New England Patriots stars shouted excitedly: 'We're going to Disneyland!'

And on Monday, wide receiver Julian Edelman and cornerback Malcolm Butler were pictured celebrating the team's victory at Disneyland in California.

Edelman and Butler - whose last-second interception helped the Patriots clinch the title - performed a special lap of honor at the Anaheim-based resort.

At the same time, the Seattle Seahawks, led by their head coach Peter Carroll, were spotted returning home dejected via plane and then coach.

On Sunday night, around 115 million viewers watched the Patriots fight their way to a 28-24 victory at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Arizona.

Coach Carroll, wearing a more formal outfit of a suit jacket and white shirt, also appeared in good spirits despite the defending champions' loss.

The Seahawks' defeat came as a huge blow to the football-crazed city of Seattle. Many residents were in a state of stunned sadness on Monday.

'The last call, I just don't know what they were thinking,' chef Forrest Temko, 27, said in a city bar. 'They should have just given it to Beast Mode.'

Although flags honoring the passionate '12th' man fan base and team posters still clung to downtown office buildings and storefront windows, there was an air of dejection at times in some offices, including online commerce giant Amazon and planemaker Boeing, employees said.

A team store at the team's CenturyLink Field was quiet, apart from a couple of shoppers who stopped to ask when merchandise would be sold at a steep discount. 'You fight so hard to get to the point where you can win it all. There are no words for it. Utter disbelief,' said fan Michael Thomas, 30.

Seattle police took a playful swipe at fans of the Denver Broncos, the team Seattle clobbered in last year's Super Bowl, saying on its Twitter feed: 'And now we all know what it's like to be a @Broncos fan.'

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray called the Seahawks loss 'heartbreaking,' but said: 'All of Seattle is proud of everything they accomplished this year and I know we'll be back next year.'

Tyler Olsen, a 30-year-old Seattle-area math teacher who 'went into shock for a minute' after the interception, said there was no guarantee a running play would have worked and urged a spirit of togetherness. 'I wouldn't put this loss on the play call,' Mr Olsen said.

The Patriots' win comes amid the deflate-gate scandal, which saw the team accused of deliberately under-inflating the footballs used in their AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts on January 18 this year.

But addressing the media about a more positive issue - the team's victory - on Sunday night, Belichick, who is the league's longest-tenured active head coach, said: 'We've got a great team, they played well again tonight. I'm so proud of all these players. I love these guys.'
