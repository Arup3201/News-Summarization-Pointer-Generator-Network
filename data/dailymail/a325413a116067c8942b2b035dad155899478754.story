Managing to capture the elusive Northern Lights is a feat in itself. But three natural wonders all in the one photograph? That certainly makes for spectacular picture. 

Scottish photographer Maciej Winiarczyk got the Northern Lights, the Milky Way and an erupting volcano all in one shot during a recent trip to Iceland.

The aurora-chaser, from Wick, Caithness, was at Jokulsarlon Lagoon when he photographed the Bardarbunga volcano erupting on October 21. The eruption  is Iceland's largest in over 200 years and is still going on today.

Another photo showcases the whole milky way with northern lights dancing in the starry sky with its rare red colour visible.   

Maciej, 42, said: 'I started shooting auroras and night sky about two and a half years ago.

'I shot my first aurora picture in January 2012 from Wick in Scotland where I live and from that time I have been chasing them regularly. I could not believe to get such an amazing show of wonders, I was so lucky.'

The photographer captures the lights purely as a hobby and works full-time as a self-employed structural engineer.

 Chasing the sky: Maciej shot his first aurora picture in January 2012 from Wick in Scotland, and has been chasing them ever since

Explosive: The current Bardarbunga volcano  eruption is Iceland's largest in over 200 years

He said: 'Most of my aurora shots are taken from Caithness on the far north of Scotland, where I live but I did two photo expeditions to chase northern lights in Iceland and other countries.

'I picked Iceland because it's easy to get there from Scotland and in case of bad weather or poor aurora activity you always have an option to shoot

remarkable and raw Icelandic landscape instead.

'I knew the volcano was erupting. I thought I might be able to photograph the Milky Way as well as the volcano but I never imagined for the cloud to break

and release the glorious dancing lights.'

Mesmerising: Spotting aurora corona, a converging spectrum of colours, is a rare event

Maciej added: 'Every aurora display is unique. The most exciting thing is seeing aurora corona, a converging spectrum of colours, but that doesn't happen too often, especially in Scotland which is too far south.

Maciej took the most recent shots on a trip to Iceland which he has just returned from. His images have won astro-photography competitions around the

world. He said: 'I've never considered myself as the world's best in capturing the lights, but some people have suggested that I am one of the leading

photographers in that field.

Award-winning: Maciej's images have won astro-photography competitions around the world

Talent: He was born and educated in Poland and has lived in Scotland for more than ten years

Options: Maciej favours Iceland as if there is bad weather or poor aurora activity, there is always Icelandic landscape to shoot

'I am never completely happy with my work and always see space for some improvement.'

On his recent trip the photographer shot a time lapse of the aurora showcasing its lights sweep across a bay. He said: 'Shooting the lights isn't simple. It depends on the aurora activity and its brightness.'

Maciej was born and educated in Poland and has lived in Scotland for more than ten years, currently living in the town of Wick in Caithness.

He added: 'The exciting experience will stay with me for a long time, it was truly amazing.'
