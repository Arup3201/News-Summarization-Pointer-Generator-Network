Stoke City are set to open contract talks with goalkeeper Asmir Begovic ahead of interest from Inter Milan.

The Bosnia international is valued at £15million by Stoke and regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in Europe. However, he has 15 months left on contract and the club will discuss new terms over the coming days.

Chairman Peter Coates said: 'He’s got a year left after this summer and we have to be realistic, we don’t want to get into a situation where his value diminishes if he doesn’t sign.'

Begovic started his career at Portsmouth in 2005, but struggled to hold down a regular starting spot for the south coast side, and was sent on multiple loan spells to the likes of Bournemouth and Yeovil Town. 

He moved to Stoke in 2010 for a reported £3.25m fee and has since established himself as one of the Potters' key players.

Indeed, the 27-year-old has been named Stoke Players' Player of the year for the last two years in a row.
