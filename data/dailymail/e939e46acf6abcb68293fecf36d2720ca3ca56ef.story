With viewing figures of almost nine million every week, the popularity of ITV's cosy period drama Downton Abbey is in no doubt.

But it appears a weekly television fix is not enough for some Downton fans, who are so fixated with the upstairs/downstairs lives of the 1920s characters that they want to re-live their favourite show on their mobile phones.

While the characters of Downton don't own mobiles themselves, the show's official app Downtonisms has been unveiled.

Memorabilia: Love all things Downton Abbey? Now you can relive your favourite moments from the period drama thanks to the official app, Downtonisms 

Available across iOS and Android devices, Downton Abbey fans can relive their favourite one-liners, or ‘Downtonisms’, from series one to four of the multi-award winning TV show with a brand new 69p app.

Fans can choose to listen to audio clips from twelve of the most popular characters with over 160 quotations to play and share across social media platforms.

One-liners: The 69p app is full of the character's favourite quotes and will also allow superfans to test their knowledge of the quintessentially British programme with the Downtonisms quiz

Memorable one-liners from the merry cast include the classic 'Vulgarity is no substitute for wit' from the inimitable Violet, Dowager Countess.

The app will also allow superfans to test their knowledge of the quintessentially British programme with the Downtonisms quiz. Users need to guess which character said which famous line from the show to be crowned top of the Downton Abbey class. Quizzers can then share their Downtonisms scores across social profiles to show off their superior knowledge. 

A spokesman for NBCUniversal International Television Production said: 'The nation’s love affair with Downton Abbey shows no sign of stopping, so we wanted to find a fun way for fans to interact with the show beyond the TV set in their living room.

'One of the beautiful things about Downton Abbey is the way comedic one-liners cut though the often tense drama with sharp wit and wonderful irreverence. Now fans of the show can hear an array of some of the best quotes from the past four series.'

Playtime: A £19.95 Downton Abbey board game, which is based on the upstairs/downstairs lives of the 1920s characters, is being sold on Amazon

Downton memorabilia isn't in short supply. The series inspired a range of wines with French blends imported by the British aristocracy in the early 1900s, like the Crawleys, being recreated last year.

The range of Bordeaux clarets and whites come from grapes grown on the same vines and from the same soil as the era depicted in the popular show.

Wines That Rock, a company that  produces the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd-branded wine, produced the wine in collaboration with Dulong Grands Vins de Bordeaux, a 130-year-old wine-making business.

Get the look: Marks & Spencer launched a Downton Abbey beauty line, including soap, nail polish, lip gloss, lotion and scented candles. The Downton Abbey Fragranced Candle (£8.50) and the three-shade Lip Gloss collection (£9.50)
