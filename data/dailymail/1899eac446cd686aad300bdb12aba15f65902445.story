The number of people cycling to work is up 17 per cent as cash-strapped Britons increasingly get on their bikes to save money and give their health a daily boost, according to a new report.

The popularity of commuting by bike has increased by 760,000 in England and Wales in the past ten years, a detailed analysis by Halfords of the latest census statistics has revealed.

The biking boom follows the success of the Government’s Cycle to Work Scheme which offers a 42 per cent discount on acquiring a bike with tax savings, and moves by many councils to encourage pedal power in order to decrease congestion and pollution, as well as to promote health and fitness.

It also reflects the huge interest in cycling promoted by the likes of Tour de France winner and Olympic hero Bradley Wiggins and fellow racers such as golden girls Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott.

In 2001, the year of the last census, the number cycling to work was 650,000 people per year.

But many urban areas that have introduced safer cycling routes and changed road layouts have seen numbers of cyclists more than double and the bike is even threatening the car in popularity as a regular choice of transport in some towns.

Walking has also seen a major upturn, up 20 per cent, along with taking the train, up 42 per cent, and light railways, tram systems and underground, up 45 per cent. The number of people opting for a lift to work has dropped along with the use of motorbikes and scooters.

Growth in the numbers of people commuting by car has slowed, though its still the favoured way of travelling by 60 per cent of the working population. Surprisingly the census figures show a marked drop in the amount of people working from home, down a third from ten years ago.

Halfords spokesman Keith Scott said: ‘As one of the biggest providers of Cycle to Work, we know just how popular this scheme has become, with growing interest from both employers and employees who are aware of how other transport costs are rising and how cycling is beneficial to their health.

‘It means less pollution and less traffic. The census figures reveal cycling is no longer just for a minority and shows how planners have to consider all road users when looking at the commuting habits in our towns and cities.’

Halfords studied the transport habits of almost 350 major towns, councils and metropolitan areas in England and Wales, detailed in the 2011 Census.

Inner London has seen the biggest 
rise in bike use, with the number of commuters cycling into work rising 
by a huge 155 per cent over the past ten years. In Brighton, nominated a
Cycling Demonstration Town, bike use is up 118 per cent and the number 
getting behind the wheel of a car in the seaside town has actually 
fallen.

Other metropolitan 
areas embracing commuting by bike include Greater Manchester, where 
cycling to work is up 25 per cent, the industrial North East with a rise
of 19 per cent, Merseyside up 12 per cent and in the conurbations that 
make up West and South Yorkshire there has been a rise of 25 per cent.

Named the UK’s first Cycling City in 2008, Bristol received extra funding to promote pedal power and has seen the popularity of cycling to work double. In Newcastle it is up 83 per cent and in nearby Gateshead the growth is 63 per cent, in Bournemouth the rise is 47 per cent while university towns of Cambridge and Oxford have seen an increase of 39 per cent and 37 per cent, Bath is up 30 per cent and Southampton 24 per cent. Overall Cambridge has more cyclists per head of population than any other town in the UK.

In the Welsh capital, Cardiff, sustainable travel campaigns have resulted in a growth of cycling to work by 68 per cent since 2001 while Nottingham, which also has an active cycling strategy, is up 17 per cent.

It is not just major urban areas that are experiencing a rise in cycling, the district of South Gloucestershire has seen an increase of 41 per cent, East Sussex is up 34 per cent, and Central Bedfordshire, which is comprised of small towns and villages, is up 33 per cent.

The Cycle to Work Alliance, which represents all the major bike retailers, said that last year saw a 7.9 per cent rise in the number taking part in the scheme compared with 2011. The biggest increase in applications came shortly after the end of the cycle-boosting Olympics and followed the announcement of inflation-busting increases in rail fares.
