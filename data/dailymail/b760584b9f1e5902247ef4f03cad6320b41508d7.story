We're used to seeing professional athletes putting fitness gear through its paces in adverts, but now a sports brand has turned to every day runners in their latest campaign.

Adidas has released a new video showing women running around London and the joy the sport brings them.

While they may never be as fast as elite athletes like Paula Radcliffe, they can still strive to be the best they can be - and discover the beauty of scenery around them on their run. 

One of the 'real' runners featured in the film is Sophie Christabel, 25, from Bow.

Why I run: Sophie says she loves the sport because it clears her mind

A lawyer by day, the running enthusiast writes a fitness blog (BePrettyFit.com) in her spare time, telling readers about her top running tips, products and challenges.

'I run to clear my mind - it's a great time to be alone and think. I also run as I like using my body and testing it's potential,' she said..

'I got into running at university initially to lose weight, but discovered so many other benefits to it once I had started and haven't stopped since.

She added: 'I love running in London and seeing so many famous landmarks when you're running - it's very inspiring. I like seeing the architecture change as you run through different areas - you can always find somewhere new.

'It's such an honour to represent every day female runners and to be part of something that will hopefully inspire other women to run in London too.'

The film shows London runners as they weave their way through the capital, taking in the sunrise over London Bridge, the urban scene of Hackney Wick and the bustling markets of Elephant & Castle, as the singer's voiceover says: 'This is my way, my city, and I will always find a way through.' 

As part of the campaign, Adidas has been encouraging runners to tweet pictures of themselves wearing their Boost trainers and revealing where their run has taken them with the hashtag 'fromwhereirun'.

Women are running in more numbers than ever before and Adidas wanted to create something that speaks directly to them

So far, Tweets have shown runners around the world pausing to take in the view as they run across fields, through cities, over mountains and around athletics tracks.

Adidas brand director Nick Craggs said: 'We know that women are running in greater numbers than ever before and we wanted to create something that speaks uniquely to them.

'The project was completed at every stage by London-based women who run the streets for their own individual reasons; united by a mutual love of running and the city they choose to do it in.'

The video is narrated by chart-topping singer Foxes, real name Louisa Allen, who has previously modeled for adidas' Energy Boost footwear and says she loves 'the whole sexy sportswear vibe'.

'I always loved what Sporty Spice wore and the way she dressed. I am particularly keen on the boost range, it feels like running on clouds, which is great for on tour when I'm trying to keep fit,' she said. 

Foxes says she isn't that keen on hitting the gym and prefers running around London Fields with her friends.

'It is quite hard to keep my fitness up because I am so busy. The best time for me to work on my fitness is when I am on tour because that way I am able to explore different cities by running around them.'
