The BBC chose not to televise the Queen Mother’s 100th birthday celebrations because it clashed with Neighbours, the event organiser claims.

The decision not to broadcast the celebrations back in 2000 drew criticism from politicians and the BBC’s own broadcasters as Britons were left puzzled as to why it was not deemed worthy for coverage.

Now Major Sir Michael Parker, who produced the celebration at Horse Guards Parade in London, as well as the Queen’s Silver and Golden Jubilees and the Royal Tournament, has claimed that the event would have interrupted the schedule for Neighbours, a popular Australian soap.

The 71-year-old said that in the lead up to the event on July 19, 2000, he was told in discussions with the BBC that the corporation did not want it to disrupt their normal broadcast that night.

In his book, It’s all going Terribly Wrong: The Accidental Showman, he wrote: ‘The BBC had just told me that they would not be covering the celebration as they had in 1990.

‘One snooty producer (who will remain nameless, although he has since turned into a right royal sycophant) said that it was an event of little importance and of no interest to the public and anyway its timing clashed with Neighbours.’

The BBC has always denied that the normal programming was the reason why they did not broadcast the celebrations.

Claims it was neighbours: Sir Michael produced the event in Horse Guards Parade which featured more than 300 charities the Queen Mother supported

A BBC spokesman said today: ‘We thought long 
and hard about covering the event, but decided that Her Majesty’s 
birthday itself (on August 4) should be the main priority.’

The
broadcaster did a two-hour outside broadcast on the Queen Mother's 
actual birthday as well as documentaries on radio stations.

The Queen Mother’s 100th birthday procession featured more than 300 charities she supported as well as civilians and soldiers. 

ITV ended up covering the parade with live coverage that was watched by more than seven million viewers as compared to BBC1’s alternative including Neighbours, Newsround and the news which attracted just 3.5 million viewers.

Tony Blair, Prime Minister at the time, the Prince of Wales and BBC broadcasters including Jonathan Dimbleby, criticised BBC’s decision.

The decision was defended by Alan Yentob, the then head of television and Greg Dyke, the then director general of BBC.

Sir Parker said: ‘I introduced myself to Greg Dyke…a couple of years later, he groaned and told me it was one of the worst decisions he had ever made.’

He was amazed that there was no interest in broadcasting the event.

Mr Dimbleby said that it was terrible decision that did not reflect what the public wanted. He said: ‘The BBC, of all institutions, should not miss the mood on those kind of questions.’

The BBC has been criticised for its 
coverage of Royal events this year including the Diamond Jubilee after 
which the corporation faced a backlash from viewers for ‘inane and 
‘mind-numbingly tedious’ coverage.

Some
viewers said the show's presenters should have 'shut up' and shown the 
boats rather than cutting to interviews and features.

Stephen
Fry led the criticism on Twitter while a Tory MP accused the 
Corporation of broadcasting 'celebrity-driven drivel', but speaking on 
Radio5 show Drive Mr Weston defended his editorial decisions and said 
the terrible weather had affected radio frequency communications.
