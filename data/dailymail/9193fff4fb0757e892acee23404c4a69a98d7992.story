A father used his own blood to stain his son's nappies in a bid to convince doctors the newborn was suffering from a serious disease, a court has heard.

Ryan Muggleton, 20, repeatedly took his baby to hospitals in Gloucester and Bristol, where he sought medical attention for a series of false complaints.

His son was given ultrasound tests, invasive examinations, intravenous antibiotics, a feeding tube,  
injections, X-Rays and numerous blood tests - when, in fact, there was nothing wrong with him.

When the baby was just nine days old, Muggleton took him to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and complained that the child had stopped breathing.

He later smeared blood on his son's nappies - telling doctors that the baby's sick and faeces had blood in it.

However, doctors became suspicious and the blood was sent off for DNA tests, which revealed it belonged to Muggleton.

He has been handed a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after pleading guilty to cruelty to a baby at Gloucester Crown Court.

Julian Kesner, prosecuting told the court: 'The 
defendant and his girlfriend were barely beyond being children 
themselves when their son was born. He was 18 and she was 16.

'The
defendant repeatedly sought medical attention for fictitious medical 
problems and soiled the baby's nappies with his own blood.

'After a stay in 
Gloucester hospital, the child was transferred to Bristol Royal Hospital 
for Children, where he remained for several days.

'Despite
what the father had told them, medical staff found no signs of genuine 
illness.

Munchausen by proxy (MBP) - also known as 'medical child abuse' - is the fabrication or intentional production of medical symptoms in another person.

It is a mental disorder that belongs to the group of illnesses called factitious disorders.

It reportedly affects one to three people in 100,000 - although the number of undiscovered cases is likely to be much higher.

Up to 90 per cent of MBP perpetrators are mothers - with victims usually under five years old.

'By proxy' indicates that a parent or carer has fabricated or exaggerated symptoms in a child, as opposed to himself or herself.

The disorder was named after Baron Karl Friedrich von Munchausen (1720-1797), who was known for telling exaggerated tales about his battles as a Russian soldier.

'DNA sample were taken from the baby's babygrow and the blood was found 
to be that of the defendants.'

He added that Muggleton's son had been discharged into foster care and is now up for adoption.

Jon Holmes, defending, claimed that Muggleton's offences were related to the mental 
illness Munchausen By Proxy.

The rare disorder involves is the fabrication or intentional production of medical symptoms in another person.

'My client has been known to me since the age of 12 and he has had a very troubled childhood,' he said.

'He was given an ASBO and has been in and out of trouble, and was taken into care himself.

'He
said goodbye to his son two weeks ago, has got a new partner and a 
regular job, but he has still got a lot of growing up to do.'

However, sentencing Muggleton, Judge Jamie Tabor QC told him: 'You were using your tiny little son to gain attention for yourself.'

He added: 'You were singularly ill-equipped for the heavy 
responsibility as a parent but this was quite horrible behaviour.

'You
caused infinite suffering and distress to both your son and your young 
partner, who thought that her child was suffering from some serious 
disease.

'Because of the 
underlying reasons for this offence and your immaturity it would be 
quite wrong for me to send you to prison but you need to be punished.'

As well as the suspended sentence, Muggleton was handed a
18-month supervision order with a 27-day programme, a two-month curfew and an
order to pay £300 prosecution costs.'
