When Cherie Higginson and her husband Mark from Wednesfield in the West Midlands decided to go on a joint diet last year not only did they lose pounds, they also managed to save a few too! 

In fact, the junk food fans shaved an incredible £5,000 off their household expenses in just 15 months by ditching the Chinese and Indian takeaways they had previously been enjoying three times a week.

And as their food bills decreased so did their waistlines as the couple lost an incredible nine stone between them. 

Cherie and Mark, who hail from the West Midlands have lost a huge nine stone between them and saved £5,000 a year after cutting out takeaways

Cherie, 37, a clinical support worker for the NHS, explained that she and Mark had become stuck in a rut finding it simpler to binge on junk food after a long day at work than to cook a healthy meal.

'We were just being lazy. It was so much easier after a day at work to get a takeaway in rather than cook. It became a habit.

'We probably had a takeaway three times a week and then we ate out at the local pub once a week as well. That's £100 a week as a family.'

Cherie, who has three children with Mark, Ewan, 14, Tia, 13 and Livvy, eight, decided to make a lasting change in the summer of 2013 when she found she barely recognised herself in her holiday photos.

She said, 'I couldn't believe it was me. At first I thought it was someone else, but then I realised that this massive person was me.'

Cherie and Mark, 40, then decided to ban convenience food from their family meals and replace it with healthy, cooked-from-fresh alternatives.

Mark, who works as a police officer, even said that his new found fitness meant that he could run after convicts better 

Before the weight loss began Cherie and Mark had a combined weight of 34st with Mark wearing size 40 jeans

The turning point: Cherie decided that something had to change after seeing photographs of herself on the beach on holiday 

And their diet plan paid off. Cherie, who once wore size 20 and weighed 16 stone slimmed down to 11st 4lb, now fitting into size 14 outfits.

Whilst Mark, who works as a police officer, also dropped from 18 stone to 14, decreasing his jean size from a 40 to a 34. 

Mark revealed that his new-found energy has even enabled him to make an arrest while off duty, 'I chased after and caught a shoplifter on my day off last week. I would never have been able to do that two years ago - I was just too unfit.'

Plus their savings have been a boost for the whole family. Mark and Cherie have paid off a £2,500 bill and they've even been able to treat the children to a number of days out with the money they have saved.

Cherie said, 'We've been to Alton Towers, Legoland and Chessington World of Adventures. We've done a lot this year which we wouldn't have been able to afford if we were still eating so much rubbish.'

Cherie has competed in several running races, including two triathlons and the Birmingham half-marathon.

'I had a BMI of 36 when I decided to change. My mother is diabetic and my doctors told me I would have ended up diabetic as well if I had kept at that weight.'
