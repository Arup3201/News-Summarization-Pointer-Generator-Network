Peter Pan's opening line of 'All children, except one, grow up', is the nation's most memorable

Peter Pan is the book with the nation's favourite opening line, according to a new poll.

'All children, except one, grow up,' wrote JM Barrie in his children's classic which scooped 20per cent of the vote in a poll commissioned to mark World Book Day next month.

But it's not just childhood fairytales that adults have fond memories of, as the opening lines from classic 19th Century novel A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens came second place, while George Orwell's 1984 completed the top three.

However, the first words of 50 Shades of Grey did little to inspire as just one in 20 (five per cent) were wooed by EL James' opening line.

One in five of those polled admitted they will put a book down if the first line isn't engaging.

However, one in four (25per cent) said they will continue reading a novel to the end even if they don't enjoy it and, with complete disregard for the opening line, 15per cent admit jumping to the last chapter first to find out a book's ending.

When it comes to reading with their children, one in eight parents (12per cent) say youngsters will switch off if a book doesn't capture their imagination quickly, and one in 10 are forced to adopt the characters' voices to make reading more enjoyable.

Parents know when they deserve an Oscar, as one in seven children (14per cent) will enjoy a book so much that they will read it again and 21per cent of people admit they've used a line from a book as their own in order to impress a member of the opposite sex.

The poll was commissioned by Asda. Laura Grooby, Asda's book buyer, said: 'First impressions are everything, and even though hundreds of new books are released every week, it is clear the nation never forgets a famous opening line.

'This year, we hope by encouraging everyone to pick up and persevere with a book on World Book Day, children and adults alike will enjoy the pleasures reading can bring.'
