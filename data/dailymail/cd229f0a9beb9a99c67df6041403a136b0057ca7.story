France were held to a 1-1 draw by Paraguay in a World Cup warm-up game on Sunday, amid concerns surrounding the fitness of Franck Ribery.

Forward Antoine Griezmann curled a perfect effort from inside the box into the far corner eight minutes from time after France had dominated the match, but Paraguay's Victor Caceres equalised in the 89th with a downward header from a free kick.

In heavy rain at the Allianz Riviera stadium, France combined well but lacked a cutting edge as coach Didier Deschamps made several changes to test his 23-man squad.

'We cannot win all matches 4-0. We found the back of the net but then we sat back a little bit too much,' said Deschamps.

'We
 knew that we would be up against a defensive team. There were some good
 things. We are not at our best but we still have time.'

Ribery's fitness remains a major concern with the Bayern Munich winger suffering from lower back pain.

'We will do our best so that he can be available for next Sunday,' Deschamps said.

Griezmann
 has played in Ribery's position on the left flank against Paraguay and 
in their previous friendly against Norway, with his impressive displays 
giving reason for optimism.

France,
 who play another friendly against Jamaica in Lille next Sunday, start 
their World Cup campaign with a Group E game against Honduras before 
taking on Ecuador and Switzerland.

After beating Norway 4-0 last week, Paraguay proved a tougher opponent.

Before
 opening the scoring, France's best chance came in the 59th minute when 
Olivier Giroud's header was tipped over the bar by Anthony Silva.

Arsenal
 forward Giroud started the game in the absence of Karim Benzema, who 
was rested along with Real Madrid team mate Raphael Varane, after the 
Spanish club won the Champions League final last weekend.

In
 2002, France coach Roger Lemerre took Zinedine Zidane to the World Cup 
after the playmaker had injured his thigh in their last warm-up game 
against South Korea. Zidane could only play in the final group game 
against Denmark and made no impact as Les Bleus crashed out in the first
 round.

At
 the 2008 European Championship, coach Raymond Domenech included the 
injured Patrick Vieira in his squad but he never played as France were 
also eliminated in the group stage.

Deschamps,
 who has already named a 23-man squad with six players on stand-by, has 
until Monday to submit his final selection to FIFA.
