Muammar Gaddafi has escaped in a state-of-the-art armoured vehicle provided by Nicolas Sarkozy, it emerged today.

In the latest extraordinary twist to the Libyan rebellion, it emerged that the French President gave the ‘green light’ to the Arab dictator receiving the £3.5 million converted Mercedes 4x4 in 2008.

Not only is it filled with communications systems capable of keeping Gaddafi in touch with his forces, but it can foil the kind of tracking systems used by the military as they try to hunt him down.

Stealthy and bulletproof: A road-going Mercedes ML, the type which has been modified with armour plating and jamming technology, and allegedly given to Muammar Gaddafi by France

It was Mr Sarkozy who ordered French jets to start bombing Gaddafi’s 
forces back in March, and last week he and Prime Minister David Cameron 
enjoyed a triumphant trip to the newly liberated Tripoli.

But investigative news site Mediapart has found documents proving that French technology firm Amesys was allowed to provide Gaddafi with the command vehicle.

The revelation comes on the day that 
pro-Gaddafi fighters fired anti-aircraft guns at revolutionary forces 
holding the northern gate of Bani Walid for a second day, as frustration with weeks of halting advances grows among the former rebel ranks.

Launching an attack: Libyan rebel fighters fire rockets as they press forward near Ouagadougou Conference Center in the outskirts of Sirte. A second front has reportedly opened up in the city's east

Weapons salvage: Anti-Gaddafi forces sift through the abandoned weapons in Sirte, taking what they can use and destroying everything left behind. Fighting remains fierce in Gaddafi's remaining strongholds

Ragtag front line: Revolutionary forces have pulled back from Bani Walid, leaving a thin front of mainly young fighters with little experience or support

Forces - no longer rebels but the military of the National Transitional Council, Libya's interim government
 - have been massed outside Bani Walid since shortly after Libya's new 
rulers gained control of Tripoli and other parts of the country in 
August.

Block-by-block fighting continues in Gaddafi's home town of Sirte, with revolutionary forces claiming to have opened a second front in the east of the city.

Of Sarkozy's armoured 4x4, Mediapart says: ‘In 2007 the sale was approved by the then Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his chief of staff Claude Gueant.

Gadhafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim has 
told the Syrian Al-Rai TV station, the Gaddafi media mouthpiece, that 17
 mercenaries from Britain, France and Qatar had been captured near Bani 
Walid.

Britain's Foreign Office said it was aware of Mr Ibrahim's claims, but had no evidence that they were correct.

Mr
 Ibrahim said: 'A group was captured in Bani Walid consisting of 17 
mercenaries. They are technical experts and they include consultative 
officers.

Most of them are French, one of them is from an Asian country that has not been identified, two English people and one Qatari.'

The
 French foreign ministry said it had no information about the report. 
Qatari officials were not immediately available for comment.

‘The vehicle was eventually delivered in 2008 - this time with the green light from the President.’

The site goes on to give details of 
the armoured 4X4 Mercedes ML - equipped with a protection cage made by 
Faraday, which prevents all electronic fields from affecting the 
vehicle.

It also comes
 with an electronic device capable of knocking out all radio frequencies
 within some 300ft of the vehicle. 
This would make the kind of targeted bombing, which has seen hundreds of
 Libyan Army vehicles destroyed over the past six months, almost 
impossible.

A military
 source in Paris said: ‘Gaddafi has almost certainly used the vehicle to
 get away. It is a product of superb French engineering, and an obvious 
means of escape.

‘Gaddafi would be able to stay out 
sight of military targeters, and be extremely well protected if he met 
enemy forces on the ground.’

In
 a further disastrous revelation for Mr Sarkozy, it emerged that the 4X4
 was part of a £25million-plus deal that also saw the French  provide 
Libya with the means to conduct email surveillance over their own 
people.

The deal was 
put together by the French-Lebanese arms dealer Ziad Takieddine,  which 
is at the centre of a party-funding scandal involving Mr Sarkozy.

The scandal, known in France as ‘Karachigate’, is linked to the selling of submarines to Pakistan.

The
 unidentified military source added: ‘All of this is disastrous for Mr 
Sarkozy. On one hand he is presenting himself as the saviour of Libya, 
while in reality he did more to keep Gaddafi in arms than almost anybody
 else.’

PR disaster: Revelations that Nicolas Sarkozy essentially gave Muammar Gaddafi the means of his escape from capture will be a major embarrassment for the French President. Both men are seen here in a 2007 photo

Sherpa, a 
French Internet watchdog group, last week filed a complaint against 
Amesys for selling equipment to Gaddafi designed ‘to track rebel 
forces’.

An Elysee Palace spokesman said: ‘We have no comment to make on any of this.’

Today
 trained fighters pulled away from Bani Walid to regroup and reinforce 
for a new assault, after they were heavily beaten in the city Friday.

Gaddafi forces opened up on the bands of ragtag, undisciplined fighters left on on the front line.

These
 include fighters as young as 18 who spend hours smoking hash, shooting 
at plastic bottles, arguing with one another and sometimes just firing 
wildly into the streets out of apparent boredom.

Slow but steady progress: Anti-Gaddafi fighters advance to bomb an area where they exchange fire with Gaddafi loyalists near Herawa, 32 miles east of Sirte

Victory is in the air: As Libyan fighters chant slogans, after taking control of Gaddafi strongholds in the desert south of Tripoli, there remains the feeling that revolutionary forces will slowly but surely triumph

Fighting is raging at Sirte, Gaddafi's hometown on the Mediterranean coast. The regime stronghold of Sabha lies hundreds of miles away in the southern deserts, and there are others deep in the central deserts like the cities of Houn and Zallah.

Revolutionaries involved in the battle at Sirte are more organised but have have made slow progress.

Today revolutionary forces shelled the city with Grad rockets and the sound of gunfights echoed through the streets.

White smoke wafted over the city, and civilians continued to flee. Gaddafi forces answered back with occasional Katyusha rockets.

Regular truckloads of fuel and food arrive from Misrata to keep the fighters supplied outside Sirte.

In the past three days, they have battled block-by-block into the western side of Sirte, along the beach and along a eucalyptus tree-lined main avenue parallel to the coast.
