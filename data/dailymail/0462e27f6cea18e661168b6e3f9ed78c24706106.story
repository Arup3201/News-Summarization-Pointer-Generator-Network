If you thought Uma Thurman's new baby's name - Rosalind Arusha Arkadina Altalune Florence Thurman-Busson - was a bit of a mouthful, wait until you meet the former Emma Louise Hodges.

A James Bond fan like no other, the 28-year-old Birmingham bartender has officially changed her name by deed poll to 'Miss Moneypenny'. With 13 other Bond girls' names in the middle.

And the single girl now hopes her new name will lead to her finding her very own James Bond.

The ultimate Bond girl: Emma Louise Hodges, left, holding her name change certificate, having taken on the monikers of 14 Bond girls to celebrate her love of James Bond films such as 1974's The Man with the Golden Gun, starring Roger Moore, Maud Adams, and Britt Ekland, right

Timed to coincide with the release of 
new Bond film Skyfall, Miss Hodges is now officially called 'Miss Pussy Galore 
Honey Rider Solitaire Plenty O'Toole May Day Xenia 
Onatopp Holly Goodhead Tiffany Case Kissy Suzuki Mary Goodnight 
Jinx Johnson Octopussy Domino Moneypenny'.

The new Miss Moneypenny said she wanted to change her name because she is a huge fan of the films,  and especially the Bond girls in them one of whom she has always dreamed of becoming.

She said: 'I've always thought how great it would be to be a Bond girl - and now I am.

'You
 see all these blokes changing their name to James Bond but nobody has 
done it with Bond girls - certainly not to this extent.

'Ultimately
 I'm a good down to earth girl, so I opted for Miss Moneypenny as the 
main name, even though she's not technically a Bond girl.

The former Miss Hodges added: 'But there's also a fun and feisty side to me as well, hence some of the other more risque names.

'I've
 always admired actresses like Honor Blackman, Ursula Andress and 
Bridgit Bardot - but the tongue in cheek innuendo of some of the names 
has always made me giggle.'

Admitting that her favourite Bond girl of all time is Britt Ekland, the barmaid said: 'She was just beautiful and brilliant in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.'

Regular girl: 'Ultimately I'm a good down to earth girl, so I opted for Miss Moneypenny as the main name, even though she's not technically a Bond girl'

Leading lady: 'I'm hoping [my new name] can mean I can find my own suave, sophisticated James Bond'

She said: 'But
 I tried to go for a nice mix of modern and old, with a combination of 
the best actresses and the greatest Bond films, such as Live And Let Die
 and Goldfinger.

'All in 
all, I wanted to be the ultimate Bond girl. I just need that call from 
Daniel Craig now asking me to be in the next film with him.'

Single Emma now hopes her new name might lead her to find her very own Mr Bond. She said: 'I’m hoping it can mean I can find my own suave, sophisticated James Bond.'

A spokesperson for Deed Poll said: 'While at the UK Deed Poll Service we have certainly had a myriad of unusual name change requests, it was certainly a delight to finally issue a deed poll to a female fan of the Bond franchise.

'We certainly enjoyed the issuing such a unique deed poll and hope Emma now feels as shaken and stirred as her new name'
