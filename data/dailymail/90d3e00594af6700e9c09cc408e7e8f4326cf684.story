Bold: Sweden's new prime minister Stefan Lofven announced that the country will recognise Palestine as a sovereign state at a conference today

Sweden faced criticism from Jewish groups after announcing that his government will recognize a Palestinian state. 

The country's incoming prime minister Stefan Lofven made the announcement today as he listed his government's priorities and revealed his new centre-left cabinet. 

Social Democratic leader Mr Lofven said that Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be resolved through a two-state solution requiring 'mutual recognition' and a will from both sides to co-exist peacefully.

Mr Lofven said: 'Therefore Sweden will recognize the state of Palestine.' He didn't say when or how that would happen.

Sweden will join more than 130 other countries that recognise a Palestinian state.

Most of the EU's 28 member states have refrained from recognising Palestinian statehood and those that do - such as Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - did so before joining the bloc. 

The move was met with criticism from a number of Jewish groups, who said that it was 'very sad' that it will recognise the state - despite the disputed nature of its borders. 

Phil Carmel from the European Jewish Congress which represents Jews in 40 countries including Sweden told Swedish news website The Local: 'This is a token move by Sweden's new government and it is ironic that Sweden recognizes a Palestinian state at a time when even Palestinians can't agree on what its borders will be.'

He added: 'A key principle of the European Union is to recognize future states based on negotiations and it is very sad that Sweden appears to have cast these negotiations aside and wants to label Palestine as a state before any formal agreement on its borders.' 

But Sweden's decision drew praise from Palestinian officials who said that they 'salute' Sweden's position.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki welcomed Lofven's announcement and called on other European Union countries to follow suit.

He said: 'In the name of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian leadership, we thank and salute the Swedish position.' 

Lofven has built a left-leaning minority government of Social Democrats and Greens after winning Parliamentary elections last month.

Sweden's former center-right government led by Fredrik Reinfeldt did not recognize Palestine as a state, stating that the Palestinian authorities did not have full control over the area. 

The Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent, sovereign state in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem as its capital, and the Gaza Strip - occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War.  

In 1988, the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declared a Palestinian state within the pre-June 1967 lines.

This won recognition from about 100 countries, mainly Arab, Communist and non-aligned states - several of them in Latin America.

The U.N. General Assembly approved its recognition of Palestine as a 'non-member observer state' in 2012.

It followed a failed bid to join the international body as a full member state in 2011 because of a lack of support in the UN Security Council.
