The  teen who stands accused of murdering her socialite mother in Indonesia and dumping her body in a suitcase has named her unborn child Stella, according to the baby's lawyer.

Heather Mack, 19, is facing execution by firing squad in Bali, Indonesia, if found guilty of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase outside a luxury hotel last August. 

The inmate is currently seven months pregnant and is due to give birth on April 1 to a little girl - which already has its own lawyer - Vanessa Favia.

Favia said Mack is naming her baby Stella, after a family member.

In another development in the high-profile case, a judge has ruled that the teen can have any lawyer she can afford.  

She allegedly wants to hire Ary Soenardi, the Bali lawyer rejected by Cook County Judge Neil H. Cohen last week as Mack sought cash from her $1.56 million trust fund to pay her legal bills. 

According to lawyers, Soenardi is known for representing 'a number of international drug smugglers, but has never before tried a murder case.

Despite this, a judge ruled on Friday that Mack can use a $1.6 million trust fund left to her by her dead mom.

On Thursday, a day after she made a preliminary court appearance to be charged with pre-meditated murder Mack sued her uncle William Wiese, to release money to pay for a defense lawyer.

Benjamin Mackoff, the interim trustee of Mack's trust confirmed Soenardi was her preferred lawyer, according to The Chicago Sun Times. 

'She is definitely within his control,' Mackoff told the newspaper. 

'She refuses to have any other attorney than Ary Soenardi. And she will not accept any other attorney at this point.'

Mack's new lawyer is expected to produce itemized bills from Soenardi but none of the money is allowed to pay for Schaefer's defense.

Cohen said he has approved the payment of $150,000 in three weekly installments of $50,000 each from Mack's trust fund to Soenardi. 

Heather Mack and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Mrs Wiese-Mack after her body was discovered in a suitcase placed in the trunk of a taxi.

Mack and her mother arrived in Bali on August 4 and stayed in Kuta before moving to the St. Regis hotel in Nusa Dua, where they planned to stay until August 14.

Schaefer had arrived on August 12 and stayed at the same hotel in a room booked by Mack under her mother's name.

Prosecutors said that booking made Mack's mother angry and led to an argument in which Mrs von Wiese-Mack, who was white, scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur.

Schaefer is black, as was Mack's father, James L. Mack, a highly-regarded jazz and classical composer who died in 2006.

Schaefer is accused of battering her with the iron grip of a fruit bowl. Security camera video showed the victim earlier having an argument with Schaefer in the hotel lobby. 

The pair have been given separate trials on charges of premeditated murder, which carry a maximum sentence of the death penalty.  

Cohen said Mack was grateful for the judge's most recent decisions and added that she had the right to choose who she wanted to represent her.
