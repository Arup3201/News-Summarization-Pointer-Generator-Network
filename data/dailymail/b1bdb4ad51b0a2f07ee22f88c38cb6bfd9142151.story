Tributes: Lesley Brown with test-tube baby Louise

The mother of the world’s first test-tube baby has died at the age of 64.

Lesley Brown made medical history nearly 34 years ago  when she gave birth to Louise.

Mrs Brown and her husband John had been trying for a baby for nine years when they signed up to what was then an experimental procedure, in vitro fertilisation.

She became pregnant at the first attempt, and 5lb 12oz Louise Joy Brown was born by caesarean section at Oldham General Hospital at 11.47pm on July 25, 1978.

The event, which gave hope to countless infertile couples, captured the imagination of the world after it was reported exclusively by the Daily Mail under the headline The Lovely Louise.

Four years later Mrs Brown, who couldn’t become pregnant naturally because her fallopian tubes were blocked, conceived a second daughter, Natalie, by IVF.

Since those pioneering days more than four million babies around the world have been born through IVF, in which a woman’s eggs are fertilised with sperm outside the body and then implanted into the womb.

Mrs Brown’s family announced yesterday that she had died at Bristol Royal Infirmary on June 6, following a short illness.

Pioneering treatment: Mrs Brown was the first woman in the world to successfully give birth following IVF treatment

Louise,
who has a naturally-conceived son Cameron, aged five, said: ‘Mum was a 
very quiet and private person who ended up in the world spotlight 
because she wanted a family so much. We are all missing her terribly.’

Mrs Brown, from Whitchurch, Bristol, 
also leaves a step-daughter, Sharon, and five grandchildren. Her husband
died five years ago, also aged 64.

The IVF treatment she received was 
carried out at Oldham General Hospital by Professor Robert Edwards, who 
was awarded a Nobel Prize for medicine in 2010, and Dr Patrick Steptoe.

Although other women had been implanted with fertilised eggs, Mrs Brown 
was the first to achieve a pregnancy which went beyond a few weeks. Some
feared the baby would be abnormal and it was only after Louise’s birth 
that minds could be put at rest.

In 2008 Mrs Brown said she had been 
so desperate to have a baby she was willing to put up with anything to 
give birth. She said: ‘If it wasn’t for Bob Edwards and Patrick Steptoe I
wouldn’t have this family.

‘Louise’s birthday makes me remember 
back to when I had her. And looking at all my grandchildren, I think how
they wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for IVF.’

Exclusive: The Mail, July 27, 1978

Two years ago it emerged that Louise 
was actually grown in a jar rather than a test-tube. The glass vessel 
was put on public display at Cambridge University.

A spokesman for Professor Edwards 
said yesterday: ‘Lesley was a devoted mum and grandmother and through 
her bravery and determination many millions of women have been given the
chance to become mothers.

‘She was a lovely gentle lady and we 
will all remember her with deep affection.’ Professor Edwards’s research
with Dr Steptoe came despite opposition from the medical and religious 
establishments and they were forced to seek  private donations to fund 
their early work.

The Daily Mail’s then editor, Sir 
David English, helped them to acquire Bourn Hall, near Cambridge, where 
in 1980 they established the first IVF clinic.
