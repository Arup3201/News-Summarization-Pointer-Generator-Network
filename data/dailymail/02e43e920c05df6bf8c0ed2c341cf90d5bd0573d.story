The trial of a man who allegedly murdered four prostitutes in the 1970s and 1990s began today with the grim details of the slayings being relayed for an emotional jury.

Joseph Naso, who is now 79-years-old, is charged with the four murders and earned the horrifying 'double initial' nickname since the first names and last names of all four of the victims started with the same letter.

His alleged victims were Roxene Roggasch, 18, was killed in 1977, 22-year-old Carmen Colon in 1978; 38-year-old Pamela Parsons in 1993; and 31-year-old Tracy Tafoya in 1994.

Victims: In the prosecution's opening statement Monday, jurors were shown pictures of Naso's alleged victims. Clockwise from top left: Roxene Roggasch, 18, 22-year-old Carmen Colon, 38-year-old Pamela Parsons, and 31-year-old Tracy Tafoya

Naso, wearing a dark suit and spectacles instead of his usual jail clothes, watched the prosecutor's presentation to the jury on Monday with little reaction.

He is representing himself and is expected to make his opening statement Monday afternoon.

Prosecutors say Naso drugged and photographed his unconscious victims, then strangled them and dumped their naked bodies in rural areas.

In one, a young woman had nylon stockings stuffed in her mouth and another pair tied around her neck.

Marin County prosecutor Rosemary Slote
also read from sections of a diary found at Naso's home that detailed 
violent rapes of women.

In a 1961 entry, the journal describes a man picking a girl up and raping her in a car in the Berkeley Hills.

'I pulled up her skirt and put it to her,' Slote said, reading from the journal.

Trial: 79-year-old Joseph Naso is being tried for the murder of four women. Naso has plead not-guilty

Naso was arrested at the time on 
suspicion of assault. Prosecutors say the woman named in that entry will
testify about the incident.

Authorities around the country have also looked at Naso as a suspect in cold cases, but none have thus far come to light.

Marin County prosecutors have built a significant case against Naso.

Investigators
discovered DNA matching Naso's profile on at least one victim, 
Roggasch, and a partial DNA match from material collected from under the
fingernails of Colon.

Also discovered were photographs — including images of at least one of the victims in the case — and what prosecutors called a 'rape journal' during a search of Naso's Reno, Nevada, house.

Naso characterized the sadistic photographs as his art and said all of his 'models' were willing participants.

Near
the pile of photos in Naso's home — with mannequin parts and women's 
lingerie strewn about — investigators said they also found a 'List of 
10' he had scrawled with descriptions of 10 women, including four 
references prosecutors believe describe the slaying victims in this 
case.

Slote also said 
she believed investigators had identified a fifth woman on the list: No.
8, 'Girl in Woodland (Nevada County).' Slot said she believed No. 8 is a
reference to a missing girl named Sara Dylan.

Dylan's passport was found in Naso's safe deposit box, along with news clippings covering the slayings of Parsons and Tafoya, which Naso had laminated with photographs he had taken of each woman, and $152,400 in cash.

A skull found in Nevada County held DNA matching Dylan's mother's profile, Slote said.

Naso is not charged with Dylan's murder, but the jury heard evidence about her case as prosecutors sought to tie Naso's list to more cold cases.

There is no indication that any of the five other women referred to on the list have been identified, but prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing.
