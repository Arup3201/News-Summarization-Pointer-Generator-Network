A jet carrying 185 passengers had to turn-around while crossing the Atlantic ocean after nine crew reported feeling 'nauseous and dizzy' while suffering from watering eyes.

The captain of the US Airways A330 Airbus alerted Air Traffic Controllers at Shannon Airport in Ireland who routed the plane directly to Dublin.

The jet landed safely shortly after 3pm and was held at a remote location at the airport while the passengers and crew were evacuated.

The aircraft had departed Venice and was en-route to Philadelphia when the crew reported feeling ill as the aircraft passed the west coast of Ireland.

According to the Irish Aviation Authority who control Irish airspace, the pilot requested an emergency landing and was routed directly to Dublin Airport, where emergency services had been placed on alert.

At least six ambulances and three specialist airport fire trucks greeted the aircraft after it landed.

According to an airline spokesperson: 'US Airways flight 715 from Venice to Philadelphia diverted to Dublin because several of our flight attendants reported medical issues.

Medical professionals are evaluating our flight attendants and we are re-accommodating our customers on other flights to Philadelphia.

'There are no reports of illness from pilots or passengers.'

The cabin crew were taken to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin for treatment while the remaining passengers and crew are staying overnight in hotels near the airport.

Irish health authorities have launched an investigation into the incident.

It is understood that the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as well as the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) will investigate the incident.
