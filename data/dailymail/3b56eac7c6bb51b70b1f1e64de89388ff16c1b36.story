Afterwards, she tweeted: ‘Thanks for all your comments :) Im honoured to be the 1st ever female football pundit on @BBCMOTD Theres a 1st for everything :)’

England striker Aluko in action for Chelsea Ladies against Notts County

Aluko, who plays for Chelsea Ladies, appeared for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics and has 26 goals in 83 caps for England.

In the 45-minute programme she gave analysis on Diego Costa’s injury, Southampton’s fine form, and Frank Lampard’s success at Manchester City.

But she saved her most incisive opinion for Rooney, who was sent off against West Ham for bringing down Stewart Downing with a wild kick.

Aluko, sister of Hull striker Sone, said: ‘There were four recovering defenders, there was no need for him to make that foul.

Eni Aluko was forthright in her views as she made her Match of the Day debut 

The Chelsea Ladies striker ranked Phil Jagielka's stunner in the Merseyside derby the goal of the weekend 

She rated it above strikes by Graziano Pelle (left) and Charlie Austin 

‘It was very reckless, there was no need for him to lash out like that. If you think of professional fouls, I’ve always been taught it should be discreet. Your teammates clap and say you stopped a counter attack.

‘The problem was it was too violent. Diafra Sakho did a similar foul and only got a yellow card because it was more discreet.

‘Rooney will be relieved they’ve won the game because he could have cost his team three points.’

The sister of Hull striker Sone Aluko gave an insight into Diego Costa's ongoing fitness battle 

And Eni Aluko also reserved praise for Frank Lampard as he continues his stunning Manchester City form 

Aluko also offered her thoughts on Costa’s continuing appearances for Chelsea despite his hamstring issues. ‘He’s Chelsea’s best player at the moment,’ she said. ‘And you have to understand Diego Costa wants to play. When I’m 70, 80 per cent fit I’m saying to my manager, “I want to play”.’

On Lampard, who has scored four goals since joining City, she added: ‘He’s proving he’s still a Premier League player. Chelsea might think, “Gosh maybe we should have kept him”.’

Aluko also named Phil Jagielka’s stunning goal at Anfield was the best of the weekend, outshining strikes from Charlie Austin’s for Queens Park Rangers and Graziano Pelle’s for Southampton.
