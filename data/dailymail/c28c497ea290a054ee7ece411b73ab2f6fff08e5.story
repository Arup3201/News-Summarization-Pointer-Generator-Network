Newborn panda twins have sparked a double celebration at a research centre in China, the first pair to be born there this year.

And tired mother Xi Mei is equally as bowled over by her tiny cubs, refusing to let one of them free from her embrace.

So small they can fit in the palm of a hand, the twins were born 26 minutes apart on Wednesday morning at the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.

Covered with a thin layer of white fur and with their eyes still tightly closed, the two are clueless to the fuss that is being made around the world over their arrival.

The second-born is a female, born at 4.47am and weighs about 154 grams, but staff have yet to identify the gender of the first which is still being held close by its mother.

Conservationists have still not named the pair.

Twelve-year old Xi Mei became pregnant in March after mating with Lu Lu, a male panda selected for breeding by the centre.

Xi Mei previously gave birth to twin panda cubs in 2005 and 2006, as well as a single cub in 2009.

It brings an uplifting note to the panda world, after neighbouring Japan announced the death of its week-old panda cub, the first born in 24 years.

The cub, born at Tokyo's Ueno zoo, died of pneumonia less than a week after its much-awaited birth which was met with huge excitement across the country.

Zoo keepers announced the death the same day the twin cubs 
were born in China.

The panda's mother, Shin Shin, arrived from China in 
February 2011 with her partner, Ri Ri.

The two went on view to the 
public soon after the devastating earthquake and tsunami the following 
month, providing Japan with some welcome good news, the Guardian reported.

Wolong National Nature Reserve, in the Sichuan Province of China, houses more than 150 highly endangered giant pandas at its China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, which has bred 66 pandas since it opened in 1980.
