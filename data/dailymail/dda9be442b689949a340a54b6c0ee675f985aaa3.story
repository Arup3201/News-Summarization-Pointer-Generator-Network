Arrest: Jefferey Williams (pictured) admits he fired the shots that hit two Ferguson officers but insists he was aiming at someone else

The man accused of
wounding two policemen during a protest rally outside the
Ferguson, Missouri, police headquarters last week appeared in
court on Monday briefly and did not enter a plea.

The shooting was the latest violent incident in months of
demonstrations in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, after a white
police officer shot dead unarmed black teen Michael Brown during
a confrontation in August.

Jeffrey L. Williams, 20, has admitted to firing the shots
that wounded the officers early Thursday and also told
authorities he was not shooting at police, Prosecuting Attorney
Robert McCulloch said on Sunday after announcing the arrest.

Williams did not give any statements on Monday during his
brief appearance before Judge Joseph Dueker in St. Louis County
Circuit Court. He is charged with first-degree assault and his
bond is set at $300,000.

Williams told Dueker he was going to hire a private
attorney, St. Louis County Public Defender Stephen Reynolds
said.

No one responded Monday at the Williams address listed in
court records, a one-story blue house that had trash strewn on
the lawn. Neighbors declined to comment.

Police had called the shooting an 'ambush' of the officers,
who were standing side by side, by a gunman embedded with
protesters, but McCulloch said on Sunday Williams may have been
shooting at someone else.

Several long-time activists have said they did not recognize
or know Williams as a protester. 'He never protested before,'
Bishop Derrick Robinson, an activist, told CNN on Monday.

The shooting of the officers, who were treated at a local
hospital and released, followed a flurry of resignations and
protests in the week after the U.S. Justice Department released
a damning report accusing Ferguson of racially biased policing.   

Wounded: In the shooting early on Thursday, a 41-year-old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound. Another officer, 32, suffered a facial wound. Above, one of the officers  is seen being taken away by EMT

St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said he believed the 20-year-old suspect attended last week's protest before the shooting happened. Activists said Williams was not a consistent fixture in their tight-knit group.

'We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,' McCulloch said of Williams' contention that he did not fire at the officers.

Williams is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action. He made a brief court appearance Monday, and the case was scheduled for a later date. Court officials said he did not yet have an attorney.

McCulloch said there may have been other people in the vehicle with Williams and that the investigation is ongoing.

Williams used a handgun that matches the shell casings at the scene, McCulloch said. He also said tips from the public led to the arrest.

Williams is being held on $300,000 bond.

Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated. She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters, who also had not heard of him.

Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement.

'This is a fear tactic,' she said. 'We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before.'

John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, 'I don't know him. I've never seen him.'

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the officers could have easily been killed in the shooting, which came amid protests in Ferguson over alleged police violence. Above, a Michael Brown supporter

The Justice Department, which launched an investigation after Brown's shooting, found pervasive racial bias in Ferguson's policing and municipal court practices. Its policeforce is mostly white and two-thirds of residents are black. 

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, its city manager and
its municipal court judge have resigned.

Williams, who had been on probation for possession of stolen
property, is accused of firing shots early Thursday from a car
just as a rally after Jackson's resignation was breaking up.

The justice report said Ferguson police overwhelmingly
arrested and issued traffic citations to black residents to
boost revenue through fines, helping to create a culture of
distrust that exploded with Brown's shooting.

Demonstrations erupted into arson and looting after Brown's
shooting in August and again in November when a grand jury
declined to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson.
