A Melbourne paramedic is lucky to be alive after experiencing first hand how life can change in an instance just two weeks ago.

Ben Dalton and his ambulance partner were dispatched to a woman's home after a mental health assessment said she needed to be taken to hospital.

But the 27-year-old had no idea he was about to face off with a near death encounter when he knocked on that very door.

Melbourne paramedic Ben Dalton had a knife swung just 10cm away from his throat by an aggressive patient

'The woman was verbally aggressive when she answered the door,' Mr Dalton told Daily Mail Australia.

'Then she suddenly pulled out a knife - it must of been up her sleeve - and she charged at me with it and just swung it at me, aiming for my throat.'

It was Mr Dalton's quick reflexes that saved him from becoming a casualty.

'I arced my head back and the knife was about 10cm away from my throat,' he said.

'Then I remember calling out "knife, knife" as I fell back into my colleague and the police who were behind me.'

From that moment, a 90 minute siege ensued as officers - including Mr Dalton and his partner - backed into a corridor behind a glass door.

'The police had their pistols drawn and were trying to hold the door shut because it didn't have a lock on it,' Mr Dalton said.

'The woman was still shouting at us, threatening to kill us, then she walked over with a pot of boiling water and told us she was going to pour it through the cracks of the glass panel.'

Mr Dalton said about 30 police arrived at the scene and were eventually able to verbally de-escalate the situation.

The 27-year-old says this isn't an isolated incident as paramedics are increasingly experiencing violence and aggression

However, the incident has left Mr Dalton traumatised.

'At the time I was in work mode but after it ended, I remember saying â€œwhat the hell was that? I nearly lost my life",' he said.

Then came the aftermath.

'After going back to the branch and debriefing, when I was finally alone I felt a huge amount of grief,' he said.

'There are times I feel waves of emotion like a tsunami force where I get smacked down and would just break down in tears.

'My sleeping patterns are getting better and the nightmares are decreasing but I'm still not sleeping well.'

But Mr Dalton says his recent confrontation isn't an isolated case.

'It's not just me and mine isn't a unique situation,' he said.

'Hundreds of paramedics go through similar incidents. This happens to ambos across the board.'

Mr Dalton says paramedics are increasingly experiencing violence and aggression when they're called out to jobs.

He believes the high prevalence of mental illness and the growing amount of drug use in society is a huge contributor.

'It's just ridiculous the amount of violence we encounter,' Mr Dalton said.

'But no one is talking about it so that's why I've decided to speak out so I can raise awareness about the kind of risks we as paramedics face on a daily basis.'
