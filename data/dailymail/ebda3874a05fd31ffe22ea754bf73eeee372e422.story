A major computer crash caused chaos at Heathrow last night - disabling the airport's baggage  system and leaving planes unable to park at their respective gates to unload.

Hundreds of passengers sat stranded on the tarmac for hours with departing flights also being prevented from leaving the London airport.

A Heathrow spokesman acknowledged the IT glitch but insisted it did not lead to any delays and that pilots had misinformed any passengers who thought otherwise. 

The systems failure also led to angry scenes inside terminals - and astonishingly many BA flights took off without passengers' luggage to relieve pressure on the airport.

One passenger, Karen Theedom, wrote on Twitter: 'We are going, minus baggage! It will be fine, I have a sense of humour. I hear NYC is pretty good for shopping!'

Another particularly unlucky passenger arrived in Hong Kong, having missed his connection flight to Taipei, only to discover his luggage was still in London.

Despite claiming their system 'was back up and running' at 9pm, many passengers tweeted their dismay at still sitting aboard stationary planes as late as 1am.

Sally Silver tweeted: 'An hour and a half on the plane at #heathrow and counting! Why do they let us on when they know we aren't going anywhere.

'And there is no guarantee our luggage will be there when we do eventually get there!! @EGYPTAIR @HeathrowAirport #heathrow.'

Earlier, a pilot on one stranded plane told passengers that electronic boards informing him what gate to park at were not working. 

British Airways was hit hardest with 23 of its jets being delayed - with six long-haul Virgin flights also late to leave. 

Hundreds of others passengers took to Twitter to express their anger at the situation.

Andrea Cecile Cohen wrote: ‏'Stuck on the plane New York bound, but not going anywhere. Computer crash to do with luggage..Great could be hours.. All #heathrow affected.'

Another passenger claimed that people were becoming increasingly annoyed as little information was being given to them.

The man, on a 18.05 flight to New York, said: 'The captain has told us there's a computer crash which is nationally affecting airlines and airports in Southern England and most of Europe.

 Flights have been prevented from taking off while those that have landed at the London airport have been stuck on the tarmac for hours - with one pilot admitting: 'This looks like quite a big problem'

'People are getting quite impatient. I think what they're doing now is rebooting all the computers and trying to get the system up and running.' 

The pilot on the New York plane was recorded as saying: 'It looks like quite a big problem. Last time this happened it affected all the airports in Europe and southern England. It's a big issue' 

A passenger on another plane, Momchil V. Michailov tweeted: 'Just landed from Boston. Apparently BA luggage system is down and they can't process bags.'

He later added: 'We were just told that we will wait on tarmac for some time & then wait even longer at gate due to "chaos" & lack of staff''.' 

There have also been angry scenes at the airport's baggage reclaim areas with some witnesses describing the situation as 'chaotic'. 

A spokesman for Heathrow Airport earlier played down the problem, claiming that all flights were on schedule but that there had been a problem with the telephone system in Terminal 1.

She said: 'We were experiencing disruption due to an IT problem but our systems are now back up and running.' 

Up to 200,000 passengers pass through Heathrow every day with around 1,400 flights taking off and landing.

Every day more than 200,000 bags are put through the airport's security system.

Many of the flights affected are British Airways. 

A statement from the airline reads: 'We are experiencing some disruption as a result of an issue with one of Heathrow Airport’s IT systems.

'We are working with the airport to resolve the matter and customers should check ba.com for the very latest information about their flights.

'We are sorry for any disruption to customers’ travel plans.'
