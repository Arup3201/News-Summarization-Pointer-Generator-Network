A mother of three who has been living openly in Britain for 16 years after fleeing an allegedly abusive husband has been extradited to the US on charges of kidnapping their children

Eileen Clark, a 57-year-old American citizen living near Oxford, was handed over to US marshals at Heathrow Airport on Thursday.

Charged with international parental kidnapping even though her three grown-up children support her, Mrs Clark will face a courtroom confrontation with her husband.

Her supporters say it is yet another example of how Britain’s Extradition Act is unfair and is being misused.

Liberty, which has represented Mrs Clark, said an emergency injunction to halt her removal had been refused just hours before she was flown to the US on Thursday.

Two medical reports had certified that she was unfit to fly but ‘disgracefully, even that evidence wasn’t enough to stop the Home Office from handing her over,’ said Liberty legal officer Emma Norton.

The charity said that removing the ‘vulnerable’ and ‘terrified’ woman was a ‘perfect example of how inhuman, unbalanced and unjust our extradition system has become’.

Witnesses said she was so distressed that she had to be taken on to the plane in a wheelchair. A Metropolitan Police officer had to intervene when the marshals tried to restrain her for the flight, informing them the Home Secretary had advised against it.

A former model, Mrs Clark left her unhappy marriage nearly 20 years ago, first moving to live with friends in California and New Mexico, and later taking her young children to live with her in Britain.

Her ex-husband, John Clark, has pursued her in the US courts even though their three offspring – all of whom are now in their 20s – bitterly oppose her extradition.

She was originally charged only with ‘custodial interference’ – not a criminal offence in Britain - after leaving her husband in 1995 but, after she instructed a US lawyer, Mrs Clark claimed she had been assured the charge had been dismissed.

However, in 2010, she was told she faced extradition the far more serious offence of international parental kidnapping.

Despite their age, all three children have been labeled ‘endangered adults’ by US authorities, who insist they only discovered she was living in Britain in 2008.

The Home Secretary upheld the original extradition order last August but her case returned to court following new human rights submissions and new evidence that Mrs Clark was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of her marriage.

Last month, two High Court judges rejected the challenge, saying the PTSD claim was ‘dubious’. Lord Justice Treacy said the removal of children without parental consent was ‘a serious matter’.

A Liberty spokesman said Mrs Clark will be held in custody in the US until she can get bail but would have trouble doing so as she has no permanent American address.

Mrs Clark claims the extradition is just part of her ex-husband’s abuse, describing it as ‘his final bid for power and control over me’.

Their daughter, Rebekah, said in May: ‘I don’t mean to sound melodramatic but I just think it would be the end of her.’

Mrs Clark claims her ex-husband used to hit her, once threatening to push her down a flight of stairs when she was pregnant.

The decision to extradite Mrs Clark was also condemned by the domestic violence charity Refuge. Sandra Horley, its chief executive, said her forced return to the US was a ‘bleak day’ and set ‘an incredibly dangerous precedent’.

She said: ‘Eileen alleges that she experienced years of domestic abuse at his hands. It is highly disturbing that her claims have not been properly examined in a court of law in this country. Instead, this terrified woman is being handed back to the States to face criminal charges.'
