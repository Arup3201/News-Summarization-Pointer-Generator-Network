Kerry Kennedy has been arrested for driving while under the influence of drugs.

Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, who is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, was found slumped at the wheel of her car after a collision in Westchester County, New York this morning.

She crashed her Lexus into a tractor-trailer on Interstate 684 around 8am, according to officials.

The collision comes just two months after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse.

Ms Kennedy, 52, drove off the highway after the crash, in which her car was damaged and she sustained a flat tire.

Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway.

They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350, according to NBC New York. There were no passengers.

She apparently told police that she had taken prescription sleeping pills - said to include the drug Ambien - before the accident.

After her arrest, Ms Kennedy was charged with driving while impaired with drugs.

She is due to appear in court in North Castle on Tuesday.

A spokesman for Ms Kennedy denied that she was under the influence.

Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests â€“ all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system.

'The charges were filed before the test results were available.'

Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy.

Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign.

She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010.

The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage.

Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated.

Kerry delivered an emotional eulogy at Mary's funeral, describing her friend as an 'angel' who had been destroyed by her own 'forces of evil'.
