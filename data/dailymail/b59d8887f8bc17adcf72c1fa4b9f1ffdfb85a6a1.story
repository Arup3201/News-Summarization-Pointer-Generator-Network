Microgravity is a tricky business. A tiny push at a skewed angle can send an astronaut floating off in the wrong direction.

Even a single strand of hair can be enough to propel a body away from a surface, as Nasa astronaut Karen Nyberg recently demonstrated.

In a video created to explain the effects of weightlessness, Nyberg used one strand of her own hair to send herself tumbling away from a wall of the International Space Station (ISS).

Even a single strand of hair can be enough to propel a body away from a surface, as Nasa astronaut Karen Nyberg recently demonstrated

Nyberg said that the experiment came about following a conversation fellow astronaut Cady Coleman had with Sandra Bullock, star of the film space thriller ‘Gravity.’

‘One of the things she told her about was how little effort it took to move around in microgravity,’ said Nyberg, who has been at the ISS since May.

‘She even told her that you could take a human hair and use it stretched out to push against a wall or a handrail – and it really takes that little effort.’

Veteran astronaut Catherine 'Cady' Coleman floated some ideas about how Bullock could portray an astronaut for blockbuster Gravity

‘Since I have the resources, I thought I would give it a try,’ added Nyberg in a video posted by Nasa.

After plucking one hair, she pressed it against an ISS handrail and fell backwards in slow motion.

Bullock sought tips for portraying microgravity from Coleman, who’s logged more than 4,330 hours in space aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia and the International Space Station.

Coleman wouldn’t be qualified to talk about the terror of floating off into space, as luckily she’s never experienced it. But she was able to field Bullock’s questions about how it feels to be an astronaut.

She told collectSPACE: ‘She wanted to know about what it is like to physically live up there and physically move around.

‘“What would you do with your hands? With your feet? What would be a natural position to work? How often do you see your crewmates? Where do you meet each other?" It was those kinds of things.’

Coleman has seen the trailer to Gravity and describes the scene where Dr Stone is sent spinning into the void as sensationalism, but admitted to collectSPACE that the film is valuable as it portrays 'real people, including women, doing a difficult job'.
