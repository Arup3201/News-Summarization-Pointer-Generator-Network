Dean Warren, 32, was given a 12-month conditional discharge at Bury St Edmunds Magistrates' Court, pictured, for attacking the new partner of his ex-wife

An angry husband attacked his estranged wife's new lover after assuming he was a burglar when he found him wearing her dressing gown, a court heard.

Quantity surveyor Dean Warren, 32, texted his wife Gemma on February 9 to say he wanted to visit her at their former martial home while they were going through a divorce

Bury St Edmunds magistrates heard how he went upstairs and then came down to find his wife's new partner Greg Hayton, 30, sitting in the living room in her dressing gown.

Father-of-two Warren asked who he was and Mr Hayton, who had just finished night shift, tried to explain that he had permission to be in the house in Glemsford, Suffolk.

Warren then punched him repeatedly in the face and body, causing a bruised nose, forehead and a cut lip as well as marks to his arm.

Prosecutor David Bryant said the injuries needed hospital treatment. He added: 'Mr Hayton did not fight back. It was a very one-sided match.'

Warren of Lavenham, Suffolk, told police in an interview he believed Mr Hayton had been a burglar.

He initially denied assault, but changed his plea to guilty at the last minute and was given a 12 month conditional discharge.

Warren was also given a restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Hayton or his wife except through a third party for matters relating to their children.

He was ordered to pay £200 compensation to Mr Hayton, court costs of £310 and a £15 victim surcharge.

The court heard how Warren had gone to live with his parents after the break-up of his marriage.

But he had been left paying rent to his parents as well as the mortgage on his family home, which was 'not financially viable'.

A solicitor then advised him to return to the family home as it was 'a big asset0'.

Declan Gallagher, defending, said: 'When he entered the house, the chap in the dressing gown did not announce himself.

'When they met, there was an instantaneous reaction on Mr Warren's part and a flurry of blows. To find someone in your wife's dressing gown would wind up most people up.'
