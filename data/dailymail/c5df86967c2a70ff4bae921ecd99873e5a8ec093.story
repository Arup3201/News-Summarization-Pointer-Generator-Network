National Parks will be exempt from plans to allow developers to convert old buildings into barn conversions and homes.

Ministers had proposed plans to make it easier for property developers to convert agricultural buildings into houses in protected areas.

The measures, which had been strongly criticised by campaigners, would have allowed disused farm properties to be turned into a maximum of three homes - without needing permission.

Ministers has proposed plans to make it easier for property developers to convert agricultural buildings into houses in protected areas including the Lake District

Developers would not have needed to apply and would have been automatically granted the right to build on the national parks, under plans to generate housing.

But now national parks, long protected as areas of outstanding natural beauty and conservation areas will be exempt from the new rules, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Instead, ministers will now release guidance designed to encourage national parks into accepting barn conversions.

Back in October the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said that more than 30 formerly protected areas are being considered or approved for large scale housing projects or developments which could leave a permanent scar on the countryside.

More than ten National Parks faced being blighted by construction schemes, while designated Areas of Outstanding Natural beauty (AONB) across home counties such as Kent, Essex and Sussex were also at risk, campaigners warned.

They warned that the national parks under threat are the South Downs, the Yorkshire Dales, Dartmoor and the Lake District.

Applications to build on â€˜so-called protected areasâ€™ have increased rapidly since the Government reformed planning rules in March 2012, making it easier for developers to get permission to build.

Totnes Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston warned the Commons that she believes the building proposals could result in overpriced second homes being built, instead of affordable homes desperately needed to help people climb on to the property ladder, the Western Daily Press reported.

Dr Wollaston said there are potentially 4,000 properties which could each be converted into up to three homes on Dartmoor,

She stressed that it was crucial to keep farming in the national park in order to protect it.
