Midfielder Steven Davis expressed his determination for Southampton to keep progressing after committing his future to the south-coast club to summer 2018.

There had been fears over how Saints would fare this term following a summer clear-out which saw several star players follow manager Mauricio Pochettino out of St Mary's.

But, under the guidance of new boss Ronald Koeman, the team have flourished. And, having climbed to third in the Barclays Premier League, Davis insisted the Saints were not about to rest on their laurels.

Davis impressed for Northern Ireland against Greece this week, helping his country to a shock 2-0 win

'I'm delighted to have signed a new contract,' Davis told Southampton's youtube account. 'I've enjoyed my football since I came here and the club is continually progressing.

'I'm excited to see where we can go together over the next few years. The club is run the right way and they try to do everything to their best ability.

'Nobody wants to stand still. We want to get better - that goes for the team and myself. I'd like to win trophies here and continually try to improve our league position. I feel we can do that at this club.

'It was a difficult summer - there's no getting away from that. But the board stayed strong and the club made some really good signings in the manager and players that came in.

Davis has been a key player for Southampton since their promotion to the top flight in 2012

Koeman, who has made a great start to life at St Mary's, is pleased with his captain's early-season form

'It's unbelievable how everyone has settled. We've had a lot of changes but it feels like we've been playing together for a lot longer than we have. We've had an exciting start and we're determined to go on and keep progressing.'

Koeman hailed the Northern Ireland captain, who led his nation to a memorable 2-0 win over Greece in Athens earlier this week, for the impact he has on his team-mates in the Southampton dressing room.

'I'm very happy because Steven is one of the key players in the team,' the Dutchman said. 'He is an international player who is doing well this season, as he has for the last few seasons.

Koeman and Graziano Pelle received the manager and player of the month awards for September

'I see Steven every day in training and in the dressing room. He is not a person who stands out by shouting a lot, but his professionalism and performances are what sets him apart and makes him such a good example for the rest of the players.

'Players like Steven are so great to have in your team, and also for the younger players who are looking to make it into the first team because they can see first hand what you have to do to become a player at the highest level like him.'
