Italian side Roma have completed the signing of Kostas Manolas from Olympiacos for €13million (£10.35m).

The Greece international has signed a five-year contract with the Serie A outfit and will replace Mehdi Benatia following the Moroccan defender's permanent move to Bayern Munich.

A statement from Roma read: 'Roma announces it has signed on a permanent transfer from Olympiacos FC Konstantinos Manolas' sporting rights for 13million euros.'

Signing: Roma paid Olympiacos €13m (£10.35) for the services of Greek  defender Kostas Manolas

Manolas attracted the attention of top European clubs, including Arsenal, following a solid 2013-14 campaign with Olympiacos.

He made 25 league appearances last season and scored three goals while he also featured in seven Champions League games for the Piraeus-based club.

The 23-year-old centre-back played four games at the World Cup for Greece this summer.

Upon leaving the Greek champions, Manolas said: 'I would like to thank wholeheartedly (Olympiacos president) Vangelis Marinakis, who from the first moment believed in my talent and believed in me. Olympiacos was, and is, for me a great family.

'I also want to thank the president who kept his word, as he always does and respected my choice to play in Rome.'
