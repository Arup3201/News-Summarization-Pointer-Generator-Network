Tony Blair has given the Labour Party more than £100,000, in an apparent bid to ingratiate himself with Ed Miliband.

The former prime minister, who has a strained relationship with the Labour leader, announced last night that he had given £1,000 to each of the 106 candidates fighting target seats for the party in May.

In a letter to candidates, Mr Blair said: ‘I know how hard it can be to raise money to fund a local campaign, but for you, in one of our 106 battleground seats, it is even more vital. This is where the election will be won for Labour and that is why I am making a donation to all 106 campaigns.

‘As one of our key seat candidates, you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face, but I have every confidence that with your drive, determination and organisational skills, you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government.’

Labour indicated that Mr Blair will also play a role in the election campaign, despite having made clear that he disapproves of Mr Miliband’s Left-wing stance.

The donation represents a relatively modest gesture from Mr Blair, whose personal fortune is estimated at anything up to £100million following years of lucrative consultancies with big corporations and foreign regimes and a string of high-profile property deals.

The source of the cash is likely to provoke unease among some Labour MPs, given controversy over Mr Blair’s dealings with dictatorships such as Kazakhstan, and the fact that he remains under the shadow of the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war, which is due to be published after the election. 

His intervention will be seen as a sign that the former prime minister is keen to mend fences with a party leadership that has publicly distanced itself from his creation, New Labour.

Although Mr Blair has said he has no desire to return to front-line politics in the UK, friends say he is distressed by the way the party he led to three election victories has turned its back on him.

Mr Blair is known to have backed Mr Miliband’s elder brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010. And he has made little secret of his dismay at the way Ed Miliband has dragged Labour to the Left and alienated business.

In December, Mr Blair warned that the tactics were likely to lose Labour the election, telling the Economist magazine that the election was shaping up to be one ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’. 

Asked if he meant a Tory win, Mr Blair replied: ‘Yes, that is what happens.’

He ‘clarified’ his comments the next day, saying he had been ‘misinterpreted’ and that he wanted and expected Mr Miliband to seize power.

A Labour spokesman last night welcomed Mr Blair’s intervention, adding: ‘We’re delighted that Tony Blair has given so generously to the local campaigns in the battleground seats our party is targeting at this general election.

‘Our campaign is not based on big posters, talking over the heads of voters, or the sound and fury of Westminster politics. It is based on millions of conversations with people on their doorsteps and in their communities.’
