Tragic: Anita Fox, 72, was found dead at a house where she worked on September 23, 2014, in Colleyville, Texas. She is believed to have been targeted for her $1m life insurance policy 

A father and son allegedly murdered a 72-year-old housekeeper to get their hands on a $1million insurance policy she didn't even know she had. 

Gerard Gorman, 48, and his son Bernard Gorman, 26, are accused of stalking Anita Fox for days in September before finding the time and place to kill her in Colleyville, Texas.

It was the first homicide in the small town for more than 20 years. 

She was employed by the owners of the house, who were away at the time of the gruesome incident.

Earlier this week, it was alleged the pair had been funneling $700 a month to maintain the policy, but it isn't known whether they knew their victim. 

The father was found dead in a Houston hotel room from natural causes last month. His son however was arrested in Florida on Wednesday.

According to the Star-Telegram, the pair became suspects after police received a tip about a pickup truck they thought was suspicious. 

The younger Gorman was arrested on October 4 on an unrelated traffic charge. He told police he gave the truck to his father so he could drive to Oklahama, according to a police affidavit.

He said he accidentally left his cellphone in the car. However, according to documents, they found a text message sent from Bernard Gorman's phone Sept. 21 that read, 'Sorry I can't talk me and him is in half murders.' 

Bernard Gorman told officers he used those words to describe an argument with his father. 

His story is believed to have unraveled when transmissions from a cell phone tower revealed he was in the area around the time of her death. 

According to the paper, officers also found internet searches for 'Anita Fox, Forth Worth' on the device. 

Three months later he was interviewed again and admitted he had lied during the first meeting. He then described how his father went inside the house and returned with blood on his arm. 

He then described how they drove to a gas station so they could then change his shirt.

Police Chief Michael Holder told the Star-Telegram : 'Their motive is greed.'We were able to get a license plate on the vehicle, and we were able to track the vehicle to the Houston area. This is one of the most complex cases I have ever been involved in.

'It is believed that they followed her for a few days to determine her habits and the right time to carry out the murder.

Police records show Gerard Gorman went into the house while Bernard Gorman waited in the car. 

The pair have a limited criminal record and police. 

The FBI and the U.S. District Attorney are now involved in the insurance fraud investigation, which could potentially involve more people and span across state lines.
