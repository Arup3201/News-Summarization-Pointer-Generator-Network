Two onlookers threw themselves into the sea to rescue a dog walker who became trapped trying to save his stricken Labrador.

The 55-year-old was battered against a sea wall for 15 minutes in Hartlepool after his black Labrador was washed into the churning waves from a concrete slipway.

The two men put their own lives at risk to drag out the man, who had tied up his three other dogs next to the Headland promenade before diving into the sea.

One of the men, a fisherman, ran a quarter of a mile to fetch a life ring in an attempt to save the dog owner.

Eventually they managed to drag the visibly distressed man out of the water where he was assisted by Hartlepool Coastguard, police and paramedics.

The dog was also saved.

The man was treated at the scene for up to an hour before being taken to the University Hospital of North Tees in nearby Stockton.

A spokesperson for Humber Coastguard said it had tasked colleagues in Hartlepool to deal with the emergency.

'Hartlepool Police called us at 2:15pm to say they had taken a call from a member of the public to say a man had entered the water to rescue one of his dogs,' he said.

'Two passers-by had also entered the water to assist the man.

'The police then called again at 2:19pm to say the man was now out of the water and that an ambulance was at the scene to assist if required.'

A North East Ambulance Service spokesman added: 'We were called to treat a man who had gone into the water to rescue a dog and was struggling to get out of the sea.

'There were no injuries that we know of but he was taken to hospital to be checked over for possible shock and hypothermia.'

The rescue came on another day of freak spring weather, with parts of Britain covered with snow and fierce thunderstorms in Kent.

Despite the winds and rain, forecasters say spring will return tomorrow with temperatures rising as high as 21C - hotter than parts of Spain.
