A black man who was shot by Utah police while armed with a samurai-style sword as part of a Japanese anime costume died of multiple gunshot wounds, including several in the back of his body, an autopsy has revealed.

Darrien Hunt suffered six gunshots wounds, and at least four entered the 22-year-old's body from behind when he was shot in September 10. 

The state autopsy results back-up an independent findings released by Hunt's family who claimed he was treated differently because he was black.

Hunt was shot after walking around a strip mall in the Utah city of Saratoga Springs wearing a red shirt and blue pants - similar to that worn by an anime character - and carrying 2.5ft steel sword

Before being shot dead, Hunt, seen in red, was seen smiling and talking to two police officers at the scene 

Hunt's mother, Susan said: 'I don't think anyone would have thought twice if it wasn't someone with an afro.'

Police have said race was not a factor in the shooting which occurred when Hunt walked around a strip mall in the Utah city of Saratoga Springs wearing a red shirt and blue pants - similar to that worn by an anime character - and carrying 2.5ft steel sword.

Police said they were called to the scene following a 911 call about a man with a sword, and shot Hunt after he lunged at them, swinging the weapon. 

Hunt's family maintain the sword was decorative, rather than dangerous.

The autopsy states an officer fired three shots when Hunt charged at him, swinging the sword, as he got out of his car.

Police then fired four more times as they chased him.

An attorney for the Hunt family, Robert Sykes, disputed the officers' account, saying a picture taken by a bystander shows Hunt smiling as he talked to two officers.

Tim Taylor, chief deputy at the Utah County Attorney's Office, said that Hunt talked to officers after they arrived, asking them for a ride.

Ms Hunt, seen speaking at a press conference above, said: 'I don't think anyone would have thought twice if it wasn't someone with an afro.'

The Hunt family's attorney Robert Sykes speaks during a press conference concerning the autopsy results; he said the fact Hunt was shot in the back means police were pursing him and he was 'probably scared to death'

He said the county attorney's investigation into whether the shooting was legally justified could be complete within a week. 

Mr Taylor said the trajectory of the shots found by the autopsy indicates Hunt was turning away when they were fired, but investigators are still looking at exactly what happened during the encounter.

The autopsy shows four of the gunshots found in Hunt's body traveled back to front. A fifth shot that struck his left arm appears to have come from the front and a sixth traveled downward after entering the back of his forearm.

Mr Sykes said: 'I think that means they were pursuing him, he was running away. He was probably sacred to death.'

Ms Susan said she hopes the officers involved are held accountable, and barred from using firearms in the future.

The officers, who are white, have been identified as Cpl. Matthew Schauerhamer and Officer Nicholas Judson.

Saratoga Springs is an upscale city of 23,000 people south of Salt Lake City. About 93 percent of residents are white and fewer than 1 percent are black, according to U.S. Census figures.
