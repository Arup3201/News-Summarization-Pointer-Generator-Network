Delighted: Carla Hodgson, 40, from Gosfort, Hampshire, was distraught when her pet Snowflake went missing

Police officers spent three days searching for a chicken that fled its pen after being chased by a cat.

Snowflake, an 18-month-old Bantam hen, had last been seen by neighbours running for its life around the family garden in Gosport, Hampshire.

When Carla Hodgson, 40, arrived home there was no trace of her, and she made a desperate call to the police.

At first, officers at Hampshire Constabulary thought it was a prank.

But eventually, they conceded, and deployed a team to trace the family pet.

Ms Hodgson, from Gosport, Hampshire, said: 'When I realised she was missing, I phoned the police and they thought it was a prank call at first.

'They must have thought: 'Is this lady for real?' but I then told I was.

'They then sent some officers round who helped me with the search.'

Neighbours joined in the hunt for 
the Bantam chicken, which lives with Ms Hodgson, her three sons and two 
Staffordshire bull terriers in Gosport, Hampshire.

Eventually, 72 hours later, they found her in the care of some children who had seen her sitting on top of a car.

Bantams can fly a short distance if they 
are startled, and after her escapade with the cat, Snowflake had flown over the wall and onto the nearest roof for safety.

Ms Hodgson was delighted.

She said: 'It was all down to community spirit. I sent out posters and knocked on doors, I had people calling me saying they had seen her.

'Two or three people told me they had seen her being taken in a house.

Desperate to find the Bantam chicken, mother-of-three Ms Hodgson called police to ask for support

'I went round there and spoke to them. They said they had found her and were not sure what to do and had taken her in.

'We live on such a large, busy road but the sheer volume of people that responded was amazing.

'She's such a pretty little chicken, I'm so relieved to get her back.'

She added: 'Snowflake is incredibly domesticated, I've taken care of her since she was a chick.

'If you bring them up from such a young age, they regard you as the mother.'
