Jailed: Drink driver Luke Sykes, 31, admitted causing the death of young beautician Olivia Flanagan and was sentenced to eight years in prison

The parents of a young beautician killed by a drink driver in a head on crash have hit out after he was jailed for just eight years.

Teenager Olivia Flanagan was on her way home from her new job when she died in the collision with 31-year-old Luke Sykes, who was over the drink drive limit.

Sykes admitted causing death by dangerous driving, and was sentenced to eight years in prison, as well as being banned from getting behind the wheel for ten years.

But the parents of 18-year-old Olivia said the sentencing guidelines for dangerous drivers responsible for fatalities were 'wholly inadequate and not fit for purpose.'

Olivia had been in her new job at a branch of Boots in the Fosse Park shopping centre in Leicester for just three weeks when her Peugeot 206 was struck by Luke Sykes' VW Passat on the A511 near Coalville in December last year.

She was also planning to buy a new house with her boyfriend Mike Davies at the time of the tragedy.

'Olivia was a stunningly beautiful young woman with a wonderful dry and funny sense of humour which people immediately warmed to,' said her family in a statement made after Sykes was sentenced yesterday.

'She was a truly wonderful, daughter, sister, aunty and friend.

'On the 5th December 2013 through no fault of her own, Olivia’s beautiful and promising life was ripped away from her through the reckless, unbelievable and sickening actions of Luke Sykes who had only recently had his driving licence returned to him in September 2013 after being previously being banned from driving.

'He was over the alcohol limit at the time of the accident.

'It is blatantly clear that the sentencing guidelines for death by dangerous driving are wholly inadequate and not fit for purpose, especially for individuals with a history of driving offences and disregard for other road users. The sentence given today certainly does not reflect the gravity of the crime and the utter devastation caused to our family through the loss of Olivia.

'Not an hour goes by where we don’t think about Olivia and feel the unbelievable pain and loss which is just indescribable and can only be felt and understood by those who have lost a child or sister in such terrible circumstances.'

Olivia's father Martin described the moment he heard of her death.

'It’s the news that every parent dreads hearing,' he said.

'She had been driving for six months and we always told her to drive carefully whenever she went anywhere and she always did.'

He added: 'She was such a beautiful daughter, inside and out, who really, really grasped life.

'She had been working as a beautician at Fosse Park and it was a job she had really wanted. She was also studying two nights a week and doing beauty treatments in her own time.

Guilty: Sykes, 31, of  Coleorton, Leicestershire, was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing

'She was going to move in with Mike - they had found a nice place. The two of them had been together for two years and they were inseparable.'

Olivia, who lived in Measham, Leicestershire, had an older brother Chris, 21, and a sister Katie, 23, who has a three-year-old son Ben.

Her mother, Donna, said: 'Olivia was such a popular girl and was loved by so many people.

'The sentence given today certainly does not reflect the gravity of the crime and the utter devastation caused to our family'

'The whole community around here is devastated. There have been so many wonderful tributes.'

Sykes, 31, of  Coleorton, Leicestershire, was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.

'Sykes chose to get behind the wheel of the car and he knew he was over the drink drive limit, his actions resulted in the death of an innocent young girl who had her whole life ahead of her,' said Detective Constable Seamus Burns of the East Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit.

'Luckily the fact that he pleaded guilty at a previous hearing has meant the family have not had to relive the events of that evening in the court room.

'The case highlights the dangers that drivers put themselves and other road users in when they believe they are safe to drink and drive.

'Sykes will now face a significant period behind bars and his family will have to live their lives without him by their side.'
