Australian triathlon legend Jackie Fairweather was always striving for perfection and didn't realise what a difference she made to the world of sport, according to Triathlon Australia CEO Anne Gripper.

The Perth-born 46-year-old, who was grappling with crippling depression,  tragically took her own life on Sunday.

Ms Gripper,  a personal friend of both Jackie and her husband Simon, said the Commonwealth Games bronze medallist and world champion, battled with her contribution to the sport and 'was always challenging herself to be better'.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Gripper said she was mourning the tragic loss of her dear friend, whom she met while she was living in Canberra and Jackie was training for triathlon competitions.

The last time Ms Gripper saw Jackie was at a book launch three months ago on the Gold Coast, where Jackie had previously lived in the 80s.

Ms Gripper wanted to acknowledge Jackie's hard work within the industry and the huge influence she had on the world of triathlon.

'Like a typical athlete and as a world champion striving for perfection, she never really thought she had made a big enough contribution to the sport,' Ms Gripper said.

'She was very keen to do anything she possibly could,' Ms Gripper said.

'From a sport perspective, I just want to acknowledge the contribution she made, particularly when things weren't going so well for the sport,' she continued.

Ms Gripper revealed that Jackie always had time to spare for aspiring athletes and  would constantly encourage the younger generation to take part in the sport, however she was constantly battling with her own demons and never thought she was good enough.

Fairweather, or Gallagher, as she was known at the time - was considered a trailblazer for triathlons back in the 1990's when she excelled to the top of her game in the international arena. 

She began competing in triathlons in 1992 and won the elite Australian National Series in her first season.

'Of all the champions we've had in our sport, Jackie was certainly one who gave back,' Ms Gripper said.

 Ms Gripper said Jackie had continued running up until the day she died, however sports commentator Jim Wilson disputes this.

Mr Wilson, who is a friend of Jackie's husband Simon,  told  Daily Mail Australia that he believes Jackie had finished competing.

Although he did not know her on a personal level, Mr Wilson is very familiar with her husband and expressed his condolences to the whole family. 

Jackie met Simon Fairweather at the Australian Institute of Sport and they married in 2004

'It's way too young and my thought are with Simon and with her family,' he said. 

Mr Wilson also encouraged anyone who is suffering from depression to seek the help they need. 

He revealed to Daily Mail Australia that he has personally sought help for the disease.

'Having lost loved ones, I don't mind saying I have had counselling and it was the best thing I ever did,' he said. 

'If you need help, seek help, it's made a difference,' he continued.

Having worked in the sports industry for decades, Mr Wilson understands how athletes are constantly striving to better themselves.  

'Athletes set high expectations and  it can be difficult if they don't reach it,' he said. 

'It can be challenging physiologically.'

'I have a lot of respect for some people who seek help and seek council,'

The Australian sports journalist and reporter praised Jackie Fairweather for her achievements and claimed that she was the 'elite of the elite' in the sports world.

Anne Gripper, a friend of Jackie and CEO of Triathlon Australia said she was mourning the loss of one the true champions and supporters of the sport

'She was a world champion athlete and to go on and win world championships and a bronze medal in the commonwealth games is just phenomenal,' he said. 

Mr Wilson said Jackie was well respected in the triathlon world and personally saw how giving she was of her time.

Mr Wilson said he has not spoken to her heartbroken husband Simon yet, however he has his number and he will be calling him to express his condolences.

'It's a very difficult time for the family I think the two of them reached the pinnacle of sport,' he said. 

'He's a decent man  and I feel very very sad for his loss and for Jackie's family.' 

Mr Wilson said that Jackie was in a very select club, having won numerous world championships and then going on to win the bronze in the Commonwealth Games. 

He also claimed that being an athlete, she would have set very high benchmarks for herself and believes that it would be 'naive' of people to think that depression is not rife in sport. 

'One in five people suffer from some sort of issue and it's a community problem,' he said.

'I have a lot of respect for  people who seek help and seek council'

'If you need help please go and talk to someone about it,'

Mr Wilson referenced Beyond Blue Lifeline, which are both organisations who work to support people suffering from depression. 

In a statement, ASC Chief Executive Simon Hollingsworth said Jackie will be sadly missed. 

'Jackie was a true star of international triathlon and a highly respected and valued member of the Australian Sports Commission and our thoughts go out to her husband, family and friends in this difficult time,' said Hollingsworth.

Jim Wilson said that  Jackie would have set very high benchmarks for herself as does every athlete and this can effect them physiologically 

She was a first class coach being appointed as the inaugural coach of the AIS Triathlon program, a position she held through until 2005, the year in which the program was awarded AIS Program of the Year.

'Jackie will be sorely missed by the many people whose lives are better for knowing her,' he said.
