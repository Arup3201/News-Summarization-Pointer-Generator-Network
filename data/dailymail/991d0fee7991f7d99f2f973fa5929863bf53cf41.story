A neighbour of two feuding men found dead in their homes has revealed how he feared for his life as one of them tried to smash into his house with an axe.

Roofer Mark Taylor said it was like a scene from The Shining when Richard Wight started hacking at the door of his home in Braintree, Essex.

He said: 'We heard a big thud on the front door. My lodger went upstairs and looked down and said, "he's got an axe". Not a small axe; a 3ft chopper.

'He cut a hole in the door and, like in the film The Shining, put his face through it.'

The body of Mr Wight, 55, was found 
in his home on Sunday afternoon after paramedics were called to the home
of his neighbour Alan Taylor, 59.

It was confirmed today that Mr Wight died from stab wounds and his neighbour died from cardiac arrest

Discovery: The scene in Braintree, Essex, where two bodies were found in neighbouring homes. One of the bodies was that of Richard Wight, who threatened Mark Taylor with an axe

Mark Taylor said Mr Wight hacked a hole in his door and stuck his face through it like Jack Nicholson in The Shining

Mark, 37, revealed how Mr Wight once came to his home
with the axe minutes after shoulder-charging his porch door and 
punching through its glass panel.

Mr Taylor said Mr Wight was shouting, 'I've f****** had enough of you', but left before police arrived.

Mark said Mr Wight 'smoked pot and liked a drink' and was known to clash with his neighbours.

On Sunday, lorry driver Mr Wight was 
found dead by police investigating the death of next-door neighbour Alan
Taylor, 59 - who was not related to Mark.

Police are treating the deaths as suspicious but are not looking for anybody else.

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Provisional results of the post-mortem on Alan Taylor have concluded that he died from natural causes.

'Provisional results of the post-mortem of Richard Wight have concluded that he died from stab wounds.'

It is thought that a 'mild-mannered' 
Mr Taylor may have snapped and killed his 'neighbour from hell' before 
suffering a fatal heart attack.

The two men were said to be involved in a long-running feud over parking.

One resident, who did not wish to be 
named, said: 'They certainly didn't get on and people are saying that it
got worse over Christmas.'

The lorry driver had a long history of terrorising neighbours in his street in Braintree, Essex.

In 2008 he was jailed for eight weeks after going to Mr Taylor's home twice on the same day and harassing him.

Neighbours said he spent seven months in custody in 2002 while awaiting a court hearing for threatening to kill Mark with an axe, but the CPS had no record of this incident.

He had an Asbo slapped on him in 2007 to address 'threatening and abusive behaviour' towards neighbours.

In 2009 he was convicted of breaching the Asbo after he abused Alan Taylor. He received a six-month conditional discharge.

Wight is believed to have served time in prison. Officers found cannabis at his house when they arrested him.

Neighbours said Alan Taylor and Richard Wight had rowed regularly before their deaths

Neighbours said Mr Wight would 
'worry' about leaving his van in the lane and often shouted at takeaway 
drivers who blocked up the road.

One neighbour, who didn't want to be 
named, said: 'Something had been going on between the pair of them - we 
said it looked like that had been rowing, it was as though they were at 
war over something.

'There was definitely tension there when I saw them.'

A police spokesman said the investigation would centre upon both men's movements since January 1.

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'From initial forensic examinations, there is every indication that we will not be looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths of Alan Taylor and Richard Wight.

'Forensic examinations of both addresses are continuing in order to clarify this position.'

Anyone with information should contact Essex Police on 101.
