A woman who was married for only 46 days before her husband was slain by their wedding guest says his minimum 20 year jail term is not long enough.

Phi Ngoc Phu Le, 27, pleaded guilty to murdering Amin Asrawe, who sustained 24 wounds inflicted with a machete and filleting knife when he was ambushed outside his Adelaide home in the early hours of August 9, 2013.

Widow Dounia Asrawe told the Supreme Court she was asleep inside when her husband was slaughtered and hated herself for not hearing his screams as she may have been able to save him.

Justice Kevin Nicholson on Tuesday sentenced Le to life, with a non-parole period of 20 years giving him a discount of six years for his early guilty plea.

Outside court, Ms Asrawe said murderers should not get sentencing discounts.

'It's still confusing to me that this man who stood at our wedding was then charged with killing my husband,' she said. 

Describing the murder as brutal, callous and senseless, the judge said Le had owed Mr Asrawe, a money lender, $30,000.

Le's lawyer submitted that her client was in fear for his life from other people after incurring more debts over drugs.

The judge found Le went to the house to confront Mr Asrawe for some purpose, perhaps robbery.

He waited for him to return home, forcing twigs into his front door lock so his victim could not escape inside.

The judge rejected the crown contention that the crime was pre-meditated, finding he formed the intention to murder during the confrontation.

Ms Asrawe told the court she was a wife for only 46 days, saying Le had been at their wedding and visited them at their home

Le had never been in trouble before, which made the case even more perplexing, the judge said.

Noting the heartfelt victim impact statements, he said Mr Asrawe was plainly a much-loved and valued member of his family.

Ms Asrawe told the court she was a wife for only 46 days, saying Le had been at their wedding and visited them at their home.

'You shook my hand and smiled at me - that very hand slaughtered my husband a few days later,' she said.
