Manly's David Williams is reportedly among a number of players facing suspension by the NRL over a betting scandal.

Manly Sea Eagle David Williams has been named as the player involved in a NRL betting scandal

The Sea Eagles winger has been named as one of those understood to have broken the code's strict gambling guidelines.

The report by The Daily Telegraph also claimed a big-name player from a Sydney club will be banned for six weeks for breaking the gambling guidelines.

The NRL is expected to sanction a number of other players on Thursday for placing small bets on matches - often as little as $5 - following an audit by its Integrity Unit.

There is no suggestion Williams, or any other player, was involved in match fixing.

Late last month, the NRL said it had found no evidence of widespread involvement of players in betting on matches, with initial inquiries indicating there were less than eight players who might face penalties for breaches.

NRL rules forbid any player, manager, club employee or game official taking part in gambling in relation to rugby league.

The latest scandal to hit the game - which comes just a week after the Todd Carney 'bubbler' furore - has broken on the morning of State of Origin III.

Williams is said to have placed a series of small $5 bets on games. There is no suggestion he was involved in match fixing
