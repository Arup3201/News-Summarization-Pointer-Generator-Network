Everyone knows an exercise  bore – the friend who shares every detail of their gruelling training regime.

Now it appears fitness fanatics are spreading their gospel online – and driving Facebook and other social media users mad.

In a survey of 1,793 people, 53 per cent said their most annoying contacts on social media are the ones who constantly post updates on their fitness and latest diet.

Did she tweet it? If she did, then this runner will have annoyed nearly everyone who saw it...

Gym enthusiasts were closely followed by foodies who can’t stop taking photos of their meals.

Third on the list are the self-consciously enigmatic, who write mysterious status updates to get their friends’ attention.

Online game players, pushy parents and
 jet-setters – who ‘check-in’ to let you know their location – were all 
major social irritants.

Also in the top ten were ‘oversharers’, who are always promoting their latest business venture or charity event.

The survey, commissioned by 
Sweatband.com, found more than half the respondents reduced their social
 media use to block the irritating updates.

Irksome! Proud parents and people who constantly check in are also at the top of most users dislike list

Sweatband.com’s Maz Darvish said: ‘We all have those friends who tell us about every single calorie they burn.

‘Whilst social media has given us a 
great way to keep in touch, it’s also given us another way to bombard 
people with things they just don’t care about.’
