The pilot of a civilian jet was left red-faced after he veered off a runway during a test run.

The jet, an Embraer E-175, was performing a high-speed taxi test with a crew of two at Kansas City International Airport when the pilot lost control and hurtled into a grassy area at the side of the runway.

Airport spokesman Joe McBride described Wednesday's incident on Twitter as a ‘mishap’.

Bungling: An Embraer E-170 was performing a high-speed taxi test with a crew of two at Kansas City International Airport when the pilot lost control

Safe and sound: The two crew members on board were not injured, according to an airport spokesman

He said: 'A Republic Airlines Embraer E175 veered off Kansas City International Airport Runway 19L at the end of a test high-speed taxi run. 

'The two crew members on board were not injured and there was no apparent aircraft damage. The runway was closed for several hours, but the airport remained open through use of Runway 9/27.'

The aircraft spent several hours on the grass while arrangements were made to have it towed to a hangar. 

Mr McBride added that the runway it was using was already closed for maintenance.

The plane was due to be used in a later service to Washington DC, so passengers were rebooked on another flight, Mr McBride said.

The incident follows news that Brazilian plane maker Embraer is telling airlines to inspect pins or bolts that hold the engines on its twin-engine E190 regional jet – a different model to the one that slid of the runway in Kansas.

An Embraer spokeswoman said that the company sent a service bulletin to airlines as a preventive measure, and called the action routine. The company declined further comment.

Virgin Australia grounded several of its Embraer E190s after discovering a problem with bolts that hold the engines to pylons that are attached to the wings, prompting Embraer to issue a worldwide alert, according to published reports in Australia.

During inspections, maintenance crews found loose bolts "to various degrees" on 12 of the 20 E190s flown by US Airways Express, part of American Airlines Group, company spokesman Paul Flaningan told The Associated Press.

He said that the bolts were tightened and the planes returned to flying the same day.

JetBlue Airways had 60 of the planes at the start of the year, according to a regulatory filing.

The E190 has between 98 and114 seats, according to Embraer's website. Airlines tend to use it on routes where they might not sell enough tickets to fill a larger plane such as a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. They are capable of long flights, with range up to 2,400 nautical miles, according to the company.

Embraer has delivered 500 of the planes and had 68 on backlog as of March 31. Other major customers for the plane include Air Canada and China's Hainan Airlines.
