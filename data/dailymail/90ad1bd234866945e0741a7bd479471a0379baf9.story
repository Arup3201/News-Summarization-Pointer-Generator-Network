As fearsome killers, Mafia members do not have the cuddliest of reputations.

But actually they are more sensitive, family-orientated and selfless than other murderers, research has found.

A study of inmates in a prison in the home of the Mafia, Sicily, showed that unlike other violent prisoners, criminals with links to the mob were not psychopathic.

The Italian researchers compared 30 Mafiosi with 39 non-Mafia criminals.

They found that the Mafiosi tended to compartmentalise their lives and feelings: on the one hand, their vicious criminal activities and on the other, their warm emotions towards relatives and friends.

The research, published in the magazine Discover, echoes the character of Tony Soprano. In hit US mob show The Sopranos viewers saw him struggle to balance the love for his family with his criminal pursuits.

Around half of the mafiosi questioned were serving time for violent offences, one quarter were murderers and the rest were convicted of crimes such as kidnapping, trafficking drugs and fraud.

Professor Adriano Schimmenti, who led the study said: 'Our findings bring new hope for re-socialisation of convicted Mafia members, because they showed significant antisocial traits but they maintained a capacity for emotional connection and greater likelihood of engaging with training and re-socialisation programmes than other imprisoned offenders in Italy.

Further, during the interviews, they often expressed concerns for their children and their families, and they had never ceased to write and call them.

'Such expressions of attachment were less apparent among the comparison men.'

They were also less likely to have addiction problems than other prisoners, he said.

‘Mafia members are required to appear reliable, maintain power and adhere to the internal representations and principles of their organisation, and such skills tend to be impaired by substance use.

'It may be that substance misusers would be less likely to be selected for Mafia membership (as they would be viewed as liabilities), and if selected by chance, their involvement would be short lived.’

The Italian researchers studied 30 mafiosi in a prison in Palermo, Sicily and compared them with 39 criminals convicted for other crimes.

The subjects were psychologically analysed using an assessment system called the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) which measures psychotic characteristics.

Those who receive a score over 30 are considered a psychopath- none of the Mafia members scored over 30 in the researchers' test.
