Sowing barley seeds, planting potatoes, and toiling in the Siberian outdoors: this is the day-to-day life of prisoners in a Russian penal colony.

About 250 inmates at the colony, near the city of Krasnoyarsk, work with farm machinery and animals as part of their punishment.

They are serving life sentences and must undertake forced labour at high-security prison camps.

Inmates at a Siberian prison camp near the city of Krasnoyarsk must sign a document every hour to confirm their presence, even while they carry out farm work

While they work, they are watched by guards at all time. Every hour they must sign a document to prove their presence.

One prisoner in these photographs is seen staying on his horse and leaning down to sign his name, saving valuable work time.

The workers do not leave the fields to take their meal break, sitting on armchairs and sofas outside to eat.

The fields are owned by the regional penitentiary system that controls the camp, which is 16 miles north-east of Siberia's third-largest city.

The area endures long cold winters, with prisoners working in camps during days where average low temperatures plummet to -11C.

Russia is thought to have about 
850,000 convicts in its prison system, with many sentenced to forced 
labour. About 60,000 prisoners are women, held in single-sex camps.

As of 2010, about 560 out of every 100,000 people in Russia were behind bars.

Russia incarcerates more people than any 
country in the world bar the United States and China, according to the 
International Centre for Prison Studies.

About 250 inmates are working in the camp under a life sentence

Russia has about 850,000 prisoners, according to 2010 figures

Inmates are kept in a system that the
country's own justice minister has described as 'monstrously archaic' 
and whose purpose has changed little for hundreds of years.

Tsarist Russia sent prisoners to remote Siberian colonies where labour was in short supply..

The system was inherited and expanded by the Soviet Union, which worked millions of prisoners to death in the gulag.
