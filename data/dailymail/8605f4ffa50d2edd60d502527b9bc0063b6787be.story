Police tell U-T San Diego, the driver lost control during a turn, went off a road and plunged through the roof of a home that sits about 20 feet below the roadway.

Sgt. Jim Lanigan says the car was a loaner from a dealership and the driver fled.

Homeowner George Strother says the BMW landed on the hood of his Nissan Pathfinder in his garage and knocked the ceiling down onto another car.

He and his wife were not hurt - they were asleep and thought the sound was an earthquake until police knocked on their door.

'My wife thought it was an earthquake,' Strother told FOX5. 'She was really freaked out.'

'Our bedroom is at the extreme other end of the house, so we were out of range,' Strother said. 

Police say it appears the driver of the BMW wasn't hurt either. 

'We didn't find any alcohol inside. No bottles. No blood. So we don't think the person was hurt very much,' said Sgt. James Lanigan of the Escondido Police Department.

'Based on the little bit of skid, they were probably going too fast around that turn.' 

The driver has not been located, Lt. Eric Skaja of the Escondido police told CNN - the person to who was driving has been identified, but has not come forward or been arrested so far.
