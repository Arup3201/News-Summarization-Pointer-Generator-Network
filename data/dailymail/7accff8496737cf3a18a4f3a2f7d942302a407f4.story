'Eye-watering' sums: High-ranking army officer Robert Jolleys allegedly took money fraudulently to pay for his children to attend boarding school

A former high-ranking army officer allegedly claimed almost £220,000 to pay for his three children to attend a prestigious private boarding school.

Lieutenant Colonel Robert Jolleys, 52, allegedly took ‘eye-watering’ sums of money to pay fees for £28,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Lancashire from the Army’s Continuous Educational Allowance.

But when Jolleys separated from his wife Judith he became ineligible for the scheme, which pays for 90 per cent of boarding school education fees for children of serving members of the Army, Swindon Crown Court heard today.

He failed to notify higher personnel and filled out forms claiming he was still married in order to receive the money seven years after the couple separated, it is alleged.

Lt Col Jolleys, who denies all the charges against him, is accused of asking Judith to lie and state that he was the main provider to the boys when investigations began.

The court heard how Jolleys’ scheme paid for sons Rupert, 22, Charles, 20 and William, 15, to attend the prestigious school and that he would not been able to afford to fund their schooling without the money.

Prosecutor Nicolas Gerasimidis told the jury how Jolleys carried out the fraud while working for the Directorate of Education Training Services for the Army in Swindon.

He said: ‘This is not all just a mistake, it was deliberate from the point at which he knew the separation was inevitable.

‘He knew what his obligations were and he didn’t fulfil those.

‘When the balloon went up he tried to put in a series of measures to try and undo the damage and save face.

‘He wanted to stop them clawing back the rather large sums of money for the education.’

He said the deception was only uncovered by accident in 2009 when Judith phoned his base to find out where he was.

Judith told officers she was no longer married to Jolleys, a surprise to his superiors who received paperwork from Jolleys stating that his circumstances had not changed.

Jolleys was also living in quarters specifically for serving members of the Forces who were married, the court heard.

Records showed Jolleys attempted to file a retrospective application in an attempt to change his status to reveal he was separated so he could fulfil criteria needed for a single parent to claim the money but Army personnel rejected the application and stated he did not qualify.

Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘As a senior officer he would have been well versed in his obligations when it came to the disclosure of these personal circumstances.

‘He knew precisely what the rules were.

‘The
point at which his marriage broke down it was his obligation to tell 
those above him and it was up to him to try and change his 
categorisation but he did not. 

‘It was all about getting boarding school fees paid for when he was not entitled to it.

‘It is a very impressive school. It is precisely the sort of place you would want your children to go.

‘It is for that reason extremely expensive, which is shown in the eye-watering sum of money he claimed.

‘Between 2002 and 2009 those eye-watering sums of money total somewhere in the region of £220,00 of school fees.’

The court heard how Jolleys tried to ‘bully’ Judith into claiming he had become the sole provider for the children when suspicions arose.

Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘He bullied her and provided her with a document which told her what to say.

‘Using my words, he told her that “you 
support me or we are serious trouble. We have just paid £220,000 worth 
of education which they may try to get back”.’

The court also heard that during divorce hearings Jolleys tried to make out that his wife was an unfit mother and accused him of ‘manipulating’ the proceedings to support his assertion that he was the primary carer, Mr Gerasimidis said.

He also allegedly forged his wife’s signature on official documents.

Mr Gerasimidis said: ‘It is further evidence - not only of the allegation that he forged her signature - but to give the impression that child benefit was going to him rather than his wife.’

He is accused of 11 offences of entering fraudulent expenses claims for education and boarding school allowances relating to his children’s schooling between 2002 and 2009.

Jolleys denies five counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception between 2002 and 2006, three charges of fraud by false representation between 2007 and 2009 and three counts of forgery 2004 and 2005.

The alleged bogus claims - totalling £218,094.11 - were made at bases where Jolleys was serving, in Upavon, Oxon, and at Harrogate, Yorkshire.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
