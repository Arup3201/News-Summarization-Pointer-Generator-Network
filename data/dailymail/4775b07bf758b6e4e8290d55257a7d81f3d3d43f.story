England Under 21 striker Saido Berahino has revealed how religion helped him cope with last season’s despair at West Brom under former manager Pepe Mel.

Berahino’s promising career dramatically hit the rocks when he was involved in a bust-up with team-mate James Morrison and then pictured taking laughing gas.

With Mel dropping him from the team, Berahino, who came to England as a refugee from war-torn Burundi at the age of 10, admitted to feeling isolated and going off the rails.

‘I felt alone, there was no one I could go to and get advice from at the club,’ said the 21-year-old striker, who had burst on the scene with a hat-trick on his full Albion debut and the winner against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

‘I was thrown into a Premier League environment I didn’t know much about. I was learning as I was going and losing Steve Clarke [the West Brom manager sacked to make way for Mel] touched me. I kind of lost myself.’

He believes that Christianity — and his family — proved his saviour in tough times.

 The striker has been in brilliant form for England's U21 side, who have qualified for Euro 2015 next June

‘God has been a big influence in my life and I think that faith helped me through,’ he said. ‘I’ve prayed for forgiveness because we’re all sinners at the end of the day.’

Berahino hit rock-bottom when he was allegedly punched by Morrison in a dressing-room row last March when the team were facing the drop.

Mel felt he could not trust the striker and the youngster blotted his copybook in April, when he inhaled nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, from a balloon while sitting in his Range Rover.

The arrival of Alan Irvine as the club’s new manager in the summer looks to have reversed his fortunes.

Irvine was a surprise choice but his record developing young players, including Wayne Rooney at Everton, is admirable and Berahino has responded with three goals already this season.

‘Everyone in the building gets on well with him [Irvine], from the staff in the kitchen to the players. We needed someone like that to bring us all together,’ said Berahino, who will hope to add to his goal tally against Burnley today.

Berahino has already played over 70 first-team games, more than Daniel Sturridge or Danny Welbeck at the same age, and would like to follow them into the England team and the Champions League.

‘That’s definitely my ambition. If they’ve done it, why can’t I?’ he said. ‘Playing for England means so much to me because this country gave me a second chance.’
