Enraged villagers armed themselves with axes and sledgehammers to tear down makeshift drug dens hidden in the woods near their homes.

The group uncovered drug paraphernalia as they destroyed four shacks that had been dug into the ground in Essex woodland, and covered over with roofs fashioned from boat sails.

Homeowners in Rowhedge plotted the secret raid with police and the council amid fears the woods could become a permanent haven for drug users and local children were being drawn in.

They discovered homemade bongs and cannabis pipes as they dismantled the covert drug dens in Donyland Woods.

Bill Nair, chairman of the Rowhedge Neighbourhood Action Panel, who led the raid, said they were keen to show drug abuse was 'not acceptable'

'This is a clear message that the people of Rowhedge will not tolerate drugs.

'We know this has become a real worry in the village for people and that worry has increased probably over the last year.

'We want to show this is not acceptable in the community.'

Zero tolerance: The group say they found drug paraphernalia as they destroyed the dens hidden in Donyland Woods in Essex

Secret raid: The villagers teamed up with PCSOs and councillors to send the message that 'it is not okay to take drugs in these woods'

The group used axes, hammers and sledgehammers to destroy four dens, which were hidden about 300 metres off Furneaux Lane and accessible via a narrow dirt track.

Inside there were seats made out of tyres as well as a lounge chair, cushions and a makeshift fire place.

Mike Lilley, borough councillor for Rowhedge, said worried parents had been lobbying the authority over the hidden drug dens.

'Now the dens have been dismantled and they are of no use to anyone,' he said.

Dave Harris, who represents Rowhedge on Essex County Council, said the group had kept their plans quiet.

'We couldn't afford word to get out,' he said.

'It is not okay to take drugs in these woods. This is a place for all the community to go and I think we've sent that message now.'

The trio were assisted in their operation by anti-social behaviour officer Terry Greenslade.

The group has enlisted the help of the Army to complete the clear-up work after tore the woodland dens apart.

Villager Alex Stephenson, who is father to a
young son, said: 'I worry for the children in the village because of 
drugs. Most people know about it but I've never been there myself. 

'I'll feel a bit better about my son growing up, but who's to say whoever built them won't just come back and do it again?'

Joseph Allen, who also lives in Rowhedge, said: 'If drug taking is going on there I think it's best for everybody that it is stopped.'

Police
said they investigated residents' concerns and had previously taken two other 
dens down, but insisted they found no evidence of drugs being taken. 

Mr Nair disputed the claims, saying: 'There was clear evidence of drug-taking.

'We found homemade bongs and pipes and if that is not evidence that drugs are being taken, I don't know what is.'
