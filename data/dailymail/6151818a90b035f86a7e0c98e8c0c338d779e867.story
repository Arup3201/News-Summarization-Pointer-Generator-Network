A four-year-old who is pictured copying the outfits and poses of celebrities and models on Instagram is now being hailed a style influencer himself.

'Mini Style Hacker' Ryker Wixom, from Los Angeles, California, whose account has almost 178,000 followers, now looks set to be paid by big name brands for appearances in future posts.

Ryker's mother, Collette Wixom, says she already gets lots of emails from brands on a daily basis. Footwear brand Skechers, in particular, sends sneakers for the preschooler to wear.

Not that she dresses Ryker in just anything. Mrs Wixom, who works full time and runs the Instagram account in her free time, tells MailOnline: 'I only work with or accept clothing from brands that I would actually purchase from.

'The majority of the time, I am styling my boys with their existing wardrobe or items that I have selected on my own.'

To make the most of the Instagram account's financial potential, Mrs Wixom has now appointed agencies Instafluence and Reach which help pair brands with tastemakers and style influencers.

She hopes that with the agencies' help, she may be able to quit her job in publishing within the next year. 

She admitted that she never anticipated this level of success when she started sharing photos of her son online.

'I was very surprised when brands started reaching out,' she told CNBC. 'This is all very new to me... I started this to do something creative and fun other than sword-fighting and mud pie-making. I never imagined it would become what it is today.' 

From the brands' perspective, it is a canny move. Sophia Greene, founder of London-based fashion agency 5th House PR, says Instagram is now a integral part of marketing for brands. 

'It is the most authentic way for a celebrity or opinion-former to endorse a brand and can push sales and brand awareness to a huge audience instantly, she told MailOnline.

'40 to 60 per cent of some of our brands' sales were directly thanks to Instagram last year.'

Mrs Wixom says that when she is paid to post on Instagram, she always discloses the fact to followers. 

And for now, all profits are being saved in a college fund for Ryker and his little brother Grey, almost two, who makes occasional cameos on the Mini Style Hacker site.

For Ryker's part, posing for his mother's photos is pure entertainment. Mrs Wixom writes on the Mini Style Hacker blog: 'We use our imaginations a ton and have a great time while doing so. If you see him with his hands in his pockets, he is holstering his imaginary laser guns. 

'If you see him leaning against a wall, he is trying to push it over with his body weight.' 

Of course, it is a priority for Mrs Wixom that the Mini Style Hacker project remains fun for Ryker. 

'I don't want it to be something he doesn't like doing,' she said. 'He is a four-year old. He's not a model kid who will do whatever I say.' 

But the concept of the blog itself is entirely lost on Ryker, she adds to CNBC.

'I've showed him the blog, and he asks me why guys dress like him,' she said. 'I say, "I don't know, they must really like your style."'
