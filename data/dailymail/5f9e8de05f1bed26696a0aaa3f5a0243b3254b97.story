David Letterman expressed his delight today that he would be passing The Late Show crown to Stephen Colbert - but didn't miss the opportunity for a quip at his successor's expense. 

Colbert was announced on Thursday as Letterman's replacement when the 66-year-old leaves in 2015 after 33 years in the job to spend more time with his family.

Letterman said today: 'Stephen has always been a real friend to me. I’m very excited for him, and I’m flattered that CBS chose him. I also happen to know they wanted another guy with glasses.'

Colbert currently hosts his own popular, political satire show The Colbert Report on Comedy Central

Colbert has been signed for a 
five-year contract with CBS for his new gig although his official start 
date is yet to be confirmed. 

The
 49-year-old has hosted The Colbert Report on Comedy Central since 2005 
where he eviscerates a large cast of political and media targets in his 
alter-ego of a hyperbolic, conservative pundit.

However Colbert told ABC that he will be ditching The Colbert Report caricature in his new mainstream role.

He said: 'I won't be doing the new show in character, so we'll all get to find out how much of him was me. I'm looking forward to it.'

Following the announcement, Colbert said: 'Simply being a guest on David Letterman's show has been a highlight of my career. I never dreamed that I would follow in his footsteps, though everyone in late night follows Dave's lead.'

The 49-year-old then quipped: 'I'm thrilled and grateful that CBS chose me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go grind a gap in my front teeth.'

Friends of the funnyman were quick to send congratulations.

As the youngest of 11 siblings in a 
family of intellectuals, Stephen Colbert's ability to make himself heard
 appears to have been ingrained from birth.

He
 was raised Catholic in Charleston, South Carolina, by his doctor-Yale 
professor father James and homemaker mother Lorna. Colbert has said in 
past interviews that although he was raised in a devout family, his 
intellectual parents taught him to be questioning of the Church, a theme
 which continues to run through his comic routines.

In
 1974, when he was ten, Stephen's father and two of his 
brothers Peter and Paul were killed in a plane crash in North Carolina. The
 tragedy and the family's subsequent move to an urban area of 
Charleston, led to him becoming an introverted teenager with few 
friends who relied on the worlds of science-fiction and fantasy. Colbert
 credits his love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons for 
sparking an early interest in acting.

By
 his own admission a slacker in the academic department, he swayed over 
whether he would attend college. He had a brief stint in a Rolling 
Stones cover band and saw his dreams of becoming a marine biologist 
shattered after surgery left him deaf in his right ear. He studied philosophy at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia then transferred to Northwestern as a theater major.

After college, he wound up in an improvised comedy troupe in Chicago where he understudied Steve Carrell and met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello. The
 trio were offered the chance to do an HBO series which earned positive 
reviews. The opportunity led to brief writing stints for SNL, MTV and 
GMA, before he was hired on a trial basis for the Daily Show in 1997.

Colbert
 satirized a news correspondent with little more than a basic grip of 
the subject he was discussing. His writing on the Daily Show earned him 
three Emmys.

In 2005, his 
news satire spin-off The Colbert Report launched on Comedy Central. It 
started with high-ratings and has held its place as one of the network's
 most-watched shows.

On April 10, it was announced that Colbert would be filling the shoes of David Letterman on The Late Show.

He lives in Montclair, New Jersey with his wife Evelyn and three children Madeleine, Peter and John.

Jimmy
 Fallon tweeted: 'I'd like to welcome the great @StephenAtHome to 
network late night and also congratulate him on his new name: Jimmy 
Colbert.'

Daily Show host Jon Stewart was dropping heavy hints last night at an event in New York, telling Vulture he thought Colbert would be 'amazing'.

Stewart
 said: 'He is a uniquely talented individual. He’s wonderful in Colbert 
Report, but he’s got gears he hasn’t even shown people yet. He would be 
remarkable.'

Speaking at the Cinema Society screening of Nicolas Cage's new movie, Joe, Stewart added: 'He’s done an amazing job with just that very narrow cast of character, but he’s got a lot more he can show.'

As he sipped a beer at Manhattan's The Handy Liquor Bar (and Chalk Point Kitchen), Stewart revealed: 'He’s got some skill sets that are really applicable, interviewing-wise, but also he’s a really, really good actor and also an excellent improvisational comedian. He’s also got great writing skills. He’s got a lot of the different capacities. Being able to expand upon [those] would be exciting.'

Colbert's contract at Comedy Central runs through to the end of 2014 however CBS and Comedy Central are both owned by Viacom.

CBS said that 'specific creative elements' - like producers, writers, 
and filming location - are still to be confirmed as is the exact date of
 the hand-off.

MailOnline last week named Colbert as a frontrunner for the job in a line-up which included Chelsea Handler, Conan O'Brien and Neil Patrick Harris.

In a statement President and CEO of CBS Corporation Leslie Moonves said: 'Stephen Colbert is one of the most inventive and respected forces on television.

'David
 Letterman's legacy and accomplishments are an incredible source of 
pride for all of us here, and today's announcement speaks to our 
commitment of upholding what he established for CBS in late night.'

Comedy Central, who are losing one of their brightest stars, also released a statement today wishing Colbert well.

'Comedy Central is proud that the incredibly talented Stephen Colbert has been part of our family for nearly two decades.

'We look forward to the next eight months of the ground-breaking ‘Colbert Report’ and wish Stephen the very best.'

David Letterman announced last Thursday that he will be retiring  to spend more time with his family in 2015 after 33 years of being a late night host.

The 66-year-old’s show is the longest-running scripted show and he has the longest track record of any talk show host in the history of late night television.

And the host made a touching on-air announcement of his retirement last Thursday.

In his final moments, he recounted the 22 years he spent working for CBS hosting the 'Late Show with David Letterman' and the 11 years he hosted NBC's Late Night.

He also guest hosted on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in the late 70s.
