Plenty of controversial dating sites are seen to objectify women, including Sugardaddie.com and Seekingarrangement.com which both

They encourage beautiful young women and rich men to sign up.

But now one allows women to take control, virtually sift through a man-ventory and purchase a man to date - just as they would pick a handbag while shopping online.

That one looks good: Is online shopping for men a step too far, or just evening out the playing field?

Women are encouraged to shop for male 
companions through an online man-market, where a catalogue of potential 
suitors is available to browse and evaluate.

Eligible man-products are placed in a shopping bag and eventually checked out if deemed satisfactory (although no money actually changes hands).

Checkhimout.com market themselves as an empowering and fun addition to the online dating pool.

Spokesperson for Checkhimout.com Marie Aniort says: 'What woman doesn’t dream about having a diverse portfolio of men at her disposal?

'Women are not only receiving full access to our revolutionary "man-market" – they are able to experiment with love in a way that has never been seen before.'

As shoppers, women may utilise the 
service for free while men must purchase credit packages to allow them 
to interact with the ladies.

However, the romantic relationship is completely at the women’s discretion - they choose whether or not they are interested in adding a man to their shopping bag.

In the meantime, men can play the waiting game while they attempt to capture the attention of different female shoppers. 

'It is an understatement to say that women are in control,' Aniort said.

'Now, women can choose to utilize men however they see fit. 

'They can view them through the objectifying lens that men typically view them through.

'Whatever her relationship needs, Checkhimout.com offers a bachelorette the full spectrum.'

The launch of Checkhimout.com also brings with it a never-before-seen experience for shoppers and man-products alike - an actual man-market shop on a High Street in central London.

'Ladies can take a break from online shopping and come in to shop our, delectable "man-ventory,"' Aniort said. 

'It will also gives our man-products the 
opportunity to interact with interested women face-to-face, so both 
parties can enjoy a new depth to the experience.'

I like that one, how about you? The website uses terms like man-market and man-products

MailOnline are yet to receive final details of the launch date, location and opening times for the actual shop.

Because of its female-controlled structure, Checkhimout.com claims to be '100 per cent harassment-free'. 

Men
may also take comfort in the fact that women whom they interact with 
are actually interested, since they have been chosen from a catalogue. 

Single ladies have a chance for love, but only while supplies last.
