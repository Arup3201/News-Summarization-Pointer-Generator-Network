A Korean War pilot who crash landed his plane to help a dying comrade is due to return to the battleground that claimed his friend.

Thomas Hudner crash landed his own plane during the dark days of 1950 when the US was locked in a bitter war with North Korea and China.

His friend Jesse Brown's plane had been damaged while flying a mission near the Jangjin Reservoir - known as the Chosin Reservoir by Americans - in the northeast of North Korea.

When Brown crashed, Hudner risked his own life and crash landed nearby with the intention of pulling Brown from the wreckage.

But Brown, who was the first African-American pilot, was trapped and Hudner was unable to free him.

When a Marine helicopter 
landed to rescue the pair, Hudner had to make the agonising decision to 
leave Brown.

Hudner promised Brown, who was mortally wounded, he would return for him.

Both men were in their early 20s but 
lived a world apart. Hudner was the white son of a successful grocery 
store owner in Massachusetts, while Brown's father was a Mississippi 
sharecropper.

In an interview with CNN, Hudner said: 'The Marine pilot pulled me aside and said dusk was approaching and he couldn't fly the helicopter in the dark and the mountainous terrain, so he had to leave.'

The pair were well behind enemy lines and even if Hudner had managed to escape the clutches of the Chinese, it is unlikely he would have been able to survive the harsh winter.

'I told Jesse that we had to get some more equipment because we couldn't get him out with what we had. I don't know if he even heard me, I'm afraid by this time he had passed.'

The Korean War broke out in June 1950 when communist North Korea attacked its southern neighbour.

United Nations forces, made up primarily of US troops, fought on the side of South Korea. China fought with North Korea.

Choisin
Reservoir was the scene of a harrowing battle waged during the brutal 
Korean winter, with frostbite a common injury. Arms and medical supplies
also froze in subzero temperatures.

Of the 15,000 US troops involved, more than 3,000 died during the 17-day struggle.

But
the Chinese forces paid a much greater price trying to force the allied
troops from their positions -- some 60,000 replacements were required 
to replace men lost to firepower and cold.

An estimated 35,000 Chinese troops lost their lives during the conflict. Some 8,000 US soldiers are still missing in action.

Now, in a rare show of cooperation 
with a country it often calls the imperialistic enemy, North Korea has 
given permission for Hudner to return to Chosin Reservoir.

Hudner told CNN he did not think the trip would ever happen.

'We're
very grateful to him (leader Kim Jong Un) and to the North Korean 
government that after all these years we've been given permission to 
look for Jesse's airplane,' he said.

He puts the chances of finding Brown's remains or his aircraft at 50-50, but said it was important.

And he believed severely strained US-North Korean relations could even get a boost.

'Of course, that olive branch has to be extended and accepted by both sides,' said Hudner.

'There's an important factor that not many people talk about, but in World War II the Japanese and the Germans were our bitter enemies and now they're some of our closest friends.'

An armistice agreement was signed on July 27, 1953, but a peace treaty has never been signed, meaning the two Koreas are still technically at war.

The 60th anniversary of the end of the war is just one week away and Pyongyang has planned a military parade and mass celebrations on what it calls 'Victory Day'.

The group is not planning on attending the commemoration.

Brown's widow and daughter, who was just a toddler when he died, are hopeful he will be found and eventually brought back home.
