They were walking the red carpet with the likes of Beyonce, Jay Z, Rihanna and Kanye West.

But congresswomen Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Sheila Jackson Lee caused more of a storm than the majority of the celebrities with their own attendance at the star-studded bash.

Both Democrats, who are outspoken over wanting to close the wealth gap between rich and poor, sparked calls of 'hypocrisy' from disgruntled voters with their appearance alongside the Holywood elite.

Within minutes of being spotted, people took to social media to question why they were there. Facebook group 100 Percent FED Up wrote: 'Inequality queens living it up at the Grammy Awards' sparking angry backlash.

Marcia Quimby Ortner posted: 'Glad this photo is going around FB. So hypocritical.'

When questioned by MailOnline, Wasserman Schultz's press secretary Sean Bartlett said she was at the Grammys attending a political event, adding that her travel was paid for through her campaign.

'The Congresswoman was at the Grammys attending a political event with some of her Democratic colleagues; she was in LA over the weekend for a series of political and official events,' he said.

'There are a few programs, workshops and informational sessions that Members on both sides of the aisle attend on the sidelines of the Grammys so they can hear directly from the creative community about the changing music industry. 

'As you might have seen reported in Politico this weekend, Congress is gearing up to deal with legislation related to copyright issues and my boss has been involved in that issue previously.'

He did not answer when questioned about how the Florida congresswoman had got the Grammy Awards ticket itself or who had paid for it. 

The chairwoman of the Democratic National recently accused the Republicans of leaving people to struggle.

'There is too wide a gap between people who are doing really well and people who are still struggling,' she told a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in Washington.

Sheila Jackson Lee’s press secretary did not respond to emails or phone messages.
