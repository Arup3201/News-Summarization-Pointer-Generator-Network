A jilted teenager strangled his 15-year-old ex-girlfriend after using her Facebook posts to track her movements in Romania.

Eduard Vaida, 17, began stalking Paula Dindiligan when she ended their two-year relationship alleging that he had hit her after becoming overly jealous.

After his arrest, he immediately confessed to the murder and a chilling boast, he told police: 'I was looking in her eyes as she died.'

Jealous and violent: Eduard Vaida, 17, murdered his 15-year-old ex-girlfriend, Paula Dindiligan, after she broke up with because he had become overly jealous and violent towards her

Paula had caught a bus to her local skating rink and when she didn't return home that evening her parents raised the alarm in their hometown of Baia Sprie in northern Romania's Maramures County.

Police checked CCTV footage which showed that she had left the rink - and tracked her movements before eventually discovering her body on a patch of wasteland.

Ex-boyfriend Vaida was immediately suspected by police and when he was arrested he admitted to the crime, claiming he had been drunk when he dragged off the road and killed her.

He said: 'I put my hands around her neck as I lay on top of her and I strangled her. I was looking in her eyes as she died.' 

Pretty and popular: Paula Dindiligan was a talented flute player and was popular with friends at arts college

Stalked until her death: Eduard Vaida started tracking her movements through Facebook when she broke up with him, and claims this is how he found her on the night he killed her

He told officers that he desperately wanted to get back together with her and could not accept that she wanted to leave him - and that he had only wanted to talk to her.

He admitted he had been stalking her under the belief that she might be meeting another man - and had managed to follow her by using updates on her Facebook account which told friends what she was doing.

Neighbour Maria Ionescu told local TV: 'I can't really take in what is supposed to have happened. Both of them were just children really. 

'They were always together and always walking around holding hands, they seemed to be very much in love. 

Parents raised alarm: Police were called by Paula's worried parents after she failed to return home from a nearby ice skating rink

'I am surprised that they broke up but even more surprised that he is supposed to have killed her. I would have sworn Edi was not a violent person.'

Paula was a popular student at the local Arts High-School and was a talented flute player. 

According to her school friends, she had previously claimed Vaida was her first love but complained that he drank too much and became violent when he was drunk.

Vaida is said to have had a troubled upbringing after his mother and sister left to live in the US -leaving him living with his father, who would often take him drinking in the local pub.

Police are currently having the teenager examined by a psychiatrist and if found to be sane and convicted, as a minor he could face up to ten years in a detention centre.
