Challenge: Tory Eurosceptics will call for David Cameron to toughen his line on renegotiation with Brussels

Tory Eurosceptics will challenge David Cameron to toughen his line on renegotiations with Brussels by calling for the UK to pull out of the single market altogether.

Up to 100 MPs are expected to back a tough manifesto to be released in November by a new pressure group called Business For Britain.

The group is run by leading Tory strategist Matthew Elliott, who ran the No To AV campaign against Lib Dem proposals for electoral reform in 2011 and is widely expected to take the helm of a No campaign in an in-out referendum promised by Mr Cameron for 2017.

In a challenge to the prime minister, who has so far refused to spell out in detail how he will approach a renegotiation with Brussels, Business For Britain will call for the UK to be a member of a ‘customs union’ – an area with close trading ties but no more.

Their intervention will call on Mr Cameron to ditch support for the single market on the grounds that it creates much of the red tape that British businesses find so onerous.

It would put Britain in a similar position to Switzerland and Turkey, countries which both have access to EU markets but are not forced to comply with every regulation from Brussels.

Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell said the prime minister should be encouraged rather than threatened by the plans since they would allow Conservatives to vote to stay in the EU. 

He said: ‘We’ve been so fixated on the single market that people have not drawn the distinction between having market access and single market compliance.

'This gives us  a sense of what membership would need to be if we were to vote to stay in. It sets out quite an appealing vision.’

Ideas suggested by the government for the renegotiation so far – including a red card system for national parliaments to block unwelcome EU plans – have not challenged the basis of Britain’s role in the EU.

The Business For Britain manifesto will argue that the UK is unlikely to be able to pick and choose which single market regulations it can keep and which it can ditch, so it would make more sense to pull out altogether.

One source close to the project said: ‘The manifesto will conclude that we should be in a customs union, not the single market.

‘What’s important for Britain is to make sure there are no trade barriers with our European partners. The support from Tory MPs is considerable.’

Dozens of MPs have already given their private backing to the plans, which they see as returning to the European Economic Community that Britain joined four decades ago.

Some Labour MPs are also signed up to the group, which is backed by John Mills, the millionaire businessman who is Labour’s largest donor.
