I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING

You can’t be a woman and not think you need to go on a diet or get a face transplant, writes Harrington at the start of her journey into the bizarre world of celebrity dieting. She exaggerates — but only a little.

Like it or not, celebrities are role models for many of us. We crave their fame, glossy hair, glowing skin and fabulous post-baby bikini bodies.

And whether from a prudent desire not to upset the public (adoration can turn sour in an instant, as Gwyneth, Angelina et al know only too well), or because they have books and fitness apps to flog, celebrities almost never admit that their astonishing beauty is a lucky accident of fate — the equivalent of winning the genetic lottery.

Rebecca was surprised to find Gwyneth’s recipe for roast fish with anchovy salsa verde was delicious

Instead, they talk about superfoods, elimination diets and kale smoothies, holding out the tantalising possibility that, if only we had their self-discipline — and unlimited supplies of kale — we, too, could find ourselves sharing a joke at the Oscars with George and Amal Clooney.

Fascinated by the fact that the easiest thing to discover about most celebs is what they consume, Harrington set herself the alarming task of following the diets recommended by 16 celebrities, from Gwyneth Paltrow to Pippa Middleton, to find out if we really are what we eat.

Her self-imposed rules were simple: try to keep exactly to the diet recommended by her chosen celebrity. Also ‘buy any cookbook a celebrity wrote, even if it looked really bad. And I would try to employ exercise regimens, clothing choices or dinner parties when appropriate’. Would she achieve her ideal body at the end of it all? Would she have any friends left? There was only one way to find out.

Paltrow, with her formidably wholesome diet and much-mocked lifestyle website, Goop, where she is currently recommending a chocolatey confection called sex bark and products from Californian health shop Moon Juice, is the Queen Bee of diet-conscious modern celebs.

After a food allergy-related panic attack, she was inspired to write It’s All Good, a cookbook that eliminated ‘bad’ foods, such as bread, red meat and cow’s milk, in favour of healthier alternatives. The astonishing cost of the ingredients for Gwyneth’s seven-day detox — almost triple Harrington’s usual weekly food budget — was a shock, and the recipe for turkey and arugula meatballs came out an offputting shade of green.

But when she consciously uncoupled from the diet, having followed it for ten days, she had lost 4 lb and discovered Gwyneth’s recipe for roast fish with anchovy salsa verde is totally delicious. From this high point, it was downhill all the way.

Liz Taylor’s diet includes the cheering element of a ‘controlled pig-out’ (she liked a whole pizza followed by a hot fudge sundae), but it made Rebecca sick. Karl Lagerfeld’s regime involves ten Diet Cokes a day and a sinister recipe for quail (‘emaciated birds with dinosaur claws’).

An attempt to live like Pippa Middleton, following the diet and exercise regime with which Kate’s sister apparently maintains her famous posterior, while holding themed parties from her book, Celebrate, came adrift when haggis, the essential ingredient of a Burns Night supper, proved illegal in New York. (It contains lung, apparently a prohibited substance in the city.)

Harrington made do with a lung-free, tinned version, but it wasn’t the same. You can’t plunge a ceremonial dagger into the steaming heart of a tin.

As the diets get more bizarre (Dolly Parton recommends chewing food then spitting it out), Harrington’s attempts to follow them become increasingly perfunctory. By the time she gets to Liz Hurley’s diet (vodka and tonic, watercress soup), she lasts three days.

At the end of it all, her weight remained exactly the same, but she was surprised at how much insight she had gained into celebrities by following their diets: ‘I never quite imagined I would understand so much about the women I profiled through their food.

‘Jackie Kennedy was very refined. Liz Taylor just wanted to drink! Gwyneth is great at everything, even healthy eating . . . I had a certain affinity for all of them after a while.’

In the end, she concludes, we shouldn’t copy celebrities, but pity them. ‘Instead of derision, [they] need compassion! Their lives are horrible!’ A thought worth remembering next time you’re tempted to embark on Gwyneth’s Warming Winter Detox.
