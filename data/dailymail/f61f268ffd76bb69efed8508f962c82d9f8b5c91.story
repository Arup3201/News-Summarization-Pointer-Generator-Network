Is he to blame?: Kevin Stange faces charges after video of his grandson abusing a puppy surfaced online

Flint-area officials are investigating a suspected case of animal cruelty after a video posted online showed a 4-year-old boy, and grandson of an already convicted felon, repeatedly throwing a puppy into the street.

Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell tells The Flint Journal he was 'very disturbed' by the video posted by neighbor Karl Collyer, which he saw after it was shared on Facebook.

The newspaper says it shows a 4-year-old boy carrying the Puppy, named Tippy, toward the street several times as the animal tries to run back into a yard.

In the video, the dog sometimes lands on his legs, head or back.

Pickell says the boy was at the home the puppy's owner, his grandfather Kevin Stange.

Pickell told reporters that Genesee County Animal Control retrieved the puppy, which wasn't injured.

In a Facebook update posted a few hours ago, Pickell said that Stange, who was in charge of watching the boy at the time, faces charges.

After interviewing Stange, police discovered that Stange was a convicted felon in possesion of a firearm.

Pickell also wrote that he has ordered Child Protective Services to conduct an investigation into the state of the 4-year-ols'd care.

'We’ve got to get this little boy help so that he doesn’t do…down the road nothing worse happens,' Pickell told WNEM.

'I just couldn't believe my eyes,' Pickell added.

'When you see the way he picked this puppy up and threw it again and again and again, you know it just didn't start.'  

Plans call for finding a new home for the dog.
