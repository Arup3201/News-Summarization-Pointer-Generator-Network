This is the first picture of a mentally unstable multimillionaire who bought a $460,000
Lamborghini and a $72,000 Mercedes-Benz for two people he barely knew.

In one photo Jeffrey  Horan is seen 
smiling as he stands next to his girlfriend Larkin Street McReynolds who
posted the snap on her Facebook page in September.

The 43-year-old, who lives in Manhattan's Upper West Side, splashed the cash during an erratic spending spree in 2010 that only ended when his family stepped in.

Now his younger brother Lawrence Horan is suing Bank of America for not protecting his money.

Erratic spending: Jeffrey Horan, seen here with girlfriend Larkin Street McReynolds, bought the luxury cars for a New Jersey contractor and a Queens woman - who he also gave $300,000 to

Mr Horan, bought the luxury cars for a 
New Jersey contractor and a Queens woman - who he also gave $300,000 to -
during which time he was exhibiting 'strange, illogical and 
self-destructive behavior'.

The complaint, which was filed on May 23 by Lawrence Horan, accuses Bank of America of 'ignoring suspicious and inexplicable activity' in his account, finding that his 'improper and erratic financial transactions...resulted in the loss of millions of dollars'.

He carried out the erratic spending spree, during which time he was exhibiting 'strange, 
illogical and self-destructive behavior'.

The suit also claims the bank knew of Horan's mental health issues and that he had been hospitalized 
for this twice, according to the New York Daily News.

Recipient: Horan bought Alexander Gershowitz, from Hoboken, New Jersey, a $460,00 Lamborghini on top of paying him $600,000 for construction work

Patient: Jeffrey Horan was treated in Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital for mental health issues in 2010 - which his bank were aware of allegedly

The 22-page Manhattan Supreme Court 
filing also seeks damages of at least $4 million from Horanâ€™s 
beneficiaries named as Alex Gershkovich and Elizabeth Ortiz.

The pair lied to Horan 'in order to take advantage of his mania and psychotic delusions,' the lawsuit charged.

According to the suit, Gershkovich, from Hoboken, New Jersey, was paid $600,000 for 
construction work on Horan's home which did not materialise.

He then gave Mr Gershowitz, given the Lamborghini as a 
gift after that.

These came after 'a chance encounter' between the two men, the suit claims.

The next recipient was Elizabeth Oritz, who received the Mercedes-Benz and a $300,00 cash transfer.

Despite
these translations taking place around the same time and at a time of 
serious mental health issues, bank officials and its monitoring system 
failed to alert Horan to any unusual activity, the suit says.

While
allowing Jeffrey Horan to empty his accounts, the bank continued to 
collect 'large sums of money for fees', Lawrence Horan said.
