Firefighters stormed a burning home to rescue the family's pet gerbils before giving the rodents oxygen in the neighbour's front garden.

Theresa Chapman, 49, rushed home from 
work after a call from a neighbour telling her her home, in Hinckley, 
Leicestershire, was ablaze.

As Mrs Chapman and her daughters Leanna, 18, and Chloe, 16, arrived at the scene, they saw firefighters emerging from the house clutching the family's pet gerbils.

Saved: The pets, named Salt and Pepper, were suffering from smoke inhalation - so fire crews administered oxygen to the pair while their colleagues battled the blaze

Chloe’s pets, named Salt and Pepper, were suffering from smoke inhalation - so fire crews administered oxygen to the pair on a neighbour’s lawn while their colleagues battled the blaze.

The inferno, which broke out on Friday evening, was caused by an electrical fault in an upstairs bedroom.

It left a hole in the roof and in the bedroom floor alongside smoke damage.

Although the gerbils escaped unharmed, the family have been left homeless, as the house needs six to seven months to be refurbished.

And Chloe is having to sit her GCSE exams, despite all her revision notes going up in flames.

Cause: The inferno, which broke out on Friday evening, was caused by an electrical fault in an upstairs bedroom

'When
 I got there the house was in flames and a fireman had the gerbils out 
on our neighbour’s garden giving them oxygen,' said dance teacher Mrs 
Chapman.

'I was out doing dance rehearsals when I got the call telling me the house was on fire and I rushed over.

'My mind was all over the place, watching my house go up in smoke, but I’m so glad the firemen were kind enough to find the gerbils and save them.

'Everyone has rallied round to help us, and the children in my dance troupe are taking it in turns to look after Salt and Pepper until we are sorted.

'We are really grateful.'

 Matt Buchan caught the pictures of the firefighters working to rescue 
the pets after he spotted the flames from across the village of Stoney 
Stanton.

'I saw the flames and heard about the fire so rushed over to the house,' he said.

'When I got there I noticed a fireman administering these adorable little balls of fur with oxygen.'

A
 spokesman from Leicestershire Fire Service said: 'Four fire engines 
were despatched from Hinckley Fire Station and attended the house.

Destroyed: Many of the family's possessions were destroyed, including 16-year-old Chloe's GCSE revision notes

'When a search team entered the house they found the gerbils in a spare room, and once the established there were no other occupants, they removed them.

'There are oxygen tanks on the side of all our engines and a reserve fire fighter, Pete Tilbury, administered the oxygen to the gerbils.

'Instead of attaching a face mask, he just put the pipe by the gerbil’s nose and after about eight minutes the gerbil came round and wandered over to his water bowl.'
