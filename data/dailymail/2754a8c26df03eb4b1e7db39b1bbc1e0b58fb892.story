When your name’s David Beckham, requests for selfies don’t just come in singles.

So the former England, Manchester United and Real Madrid football maestro was happy to oblige a hat-trick of ladies with their camera phones during a break in play at Wimbledon yesterday.

David Beckham took to the 74 exclusive wicker seats - but wife Victoria was not with him as he brought his mother instead.

It has become traditional for people from the world of sport to watch the Centre Court action on the middle Saturday of the tournament, and Beckham is in good company.

Someone does not appear to be making it so as Star Trek: The Next Generation's Sir Patrick Stewart (left) does not look very happy at Wimbledon unlike the two ladies posing for a selfie with David Beckham

Day out: Sandra Beckham beamed proudly in the Royal Box at Wimbledon as her son David and Sir Bobby Charlton stood for the applauding crowds

Good company: Today's Royal Box line-up included Sir Bradley Wiggins, Victoria Pendleton, David Haye, Sachin Tendulkar, Tom Daley and military personnel

Gloomy: Staff were able to remove the rain cover from Centre Court after drizzling subsided this morning but forecasters warn of imminent thunder

Accompanied by his mother Sandra, Beckham is joined by British Olympic medallists Tom Daley, Victoria Pendleton, Nicola Adams, Sir Matthew Pinsent, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Amy Williams and Lizzie Yarnold.

While World Cup winner Sir Bobby Charlton
 is among the Royal Box guests, none of the current 
England team will be making an appearance in the exclusive area despite 
being home early from Brazil.

Other sports figures include England rugby captain Chris Robshaw, England Test cricketers past and present Phil Tufnell, Andrew Strauss, Stuart Broad and Steven Finn, along with golfer Ian Poulter, and boxing stars David Haye and Anthony Joshua.

Breezed through: Rafael Nadal is recovering from his poor performance last year and today stormed past Kukushkin 6-7, 6-1, 6-1, 6-1

Under cover: Crowds were sheltered under the custom-built roof for Rafael Nadal's clash on Centre Court today with Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin

Cricketers: Andrew Strauss and Sachin Tendulkar represented the cricket world at the tournament to watch the Spanish player

Straight from training: Diver Tom Daley looked spritely at the event having dashed over from an early morning training session in the pool

Take a bow: British boxers Nicola Adams, Anthony Joshua and David Haye also stood in the box cluttered with sports stars and members of the armed forces

Tradition: Victoria Pendleton also attended on the middle Saturday of the competition, now traditionally the day when sports figures attend SW19

Dapper: Sir Bradley Wiggins showcased a cropped hairdo and a dapper three-piece suit as he gave a wave ahead of Nadal's clash with Kukushkin

Occasion: Military personnel also took up some of the 74 exclusive wicker chairs in the Royal Box and stood to mark Armed Forces Day

Andy Murray's mother Judy also joined the stars following her son's Centre Court win last night.

Tennis fans at the SW19 Grand Slam have been putting up their umbrellas and hoods as showers are falling over the All England Club.

Happy: David Tennant and his wife Georgia Moffett, the daughter of former Doctor Who Peter Davison, enjoyed the tennis players' performances

Glowing: Paralympic skiers Kelly Gallagher (right) and Charlotte Evans looked radiant in summer dresses in the Royal Box sat behind Judy Murray

Dressed to impress: Golfers Matthew Fitzpatrick (left) and Ian Poulter (right) looked sharp in suits, the mandatory dress code for men in the Royal Box

Retired swimmer Mark Foster hardly seems to mind the grey clouds rolling overheard having evidently caught some rays recently with his bronzed look

Rain chic: Spectators take shelter from rain showers at the All England Tennis Club in ponchos but keep it summery with headbands dotted with white flowers

Undeterred: Despite the tempestuous weather, hundreds of tennis fans gathered outside with picnics to watch the clash wearing ponchos and wellies

On other courts, the stands were a multi-coloured sea of umbrellas as rain delayed the start of play - but none of the beaming spectators seemed to mind

Kitted out: Despite slightly abbreviating his name, these Rafa fans went to great effort to show their support for the Spanish player

Pimms o'Clock? It doesn't seem like perfect weather for Pimms but determined picnickers came armed with bottle-loads to sip through the match

Glum: A grey mist hung over London but tennis fans happily perched on the edge of a pond for the occasion

The Met Office said the area will see heavy showers today with a risk of thunder and lightning, although there will be some sunny spells.

The roof on Centre Court means play is guaranteed.

Spanish star Rafael Nadal opened the show on Centre Court with a four-set victory over Mikhail Kukushkin -  but rain has stopped play on all the outside courts.
