He was a Republican president to no end, with some political pundits even arguing he may be the last, as support for the right-wing party - especially among Millenials - continues to wane.

And now it seems that not even the daughters of George W. Bush stand behind his cause.

Neither of the Texas-born twins - both 32 - have registered as Republican voters, it has emerged.

According to The New York Daily News, Jenna Bush Hager is registered to New York's Independence Party, while Barbara Pierce Bush is not affiliated with any political party.

She is however registered to vote in Texas, where she lives with her family.

The Daily News reports that Jenna's registration was actually accidental.

The newspaper said the younger twin intended to register as an Independent, however mistakenly ticked the Independence Party.

'Jenna registered to vote in New York soon after her daughter was born, and like all new moms, she was functioning on very little sleep,' a spokeswoman said.

'She mistakenly registered for the Independence Party.'

In an interview with People in 2010, two years after their father was succeeded by Barack Obama, the women said they chose not to embrace any party.

'I don't really label myself as Republican or Democrat,' Barbara told the magazine.

'We're both very independent thinkers,' Jenna added.

In January, a survey ranking the social and political attitudes of different generations showed that each successive generation had become more politically independent, according to Mother Jones.

The survey, by the Pew Research Center, showed that 50 percent of Millennials described themselves as political independents and about 29 percent said they were not affiliated with any religion.

Crucially, the study showed that voting patterns had been relatively consistent for the last 40 years, however after the George Bush presidency voters left the Republican party en masse.

In June, first lady Michelle Obama and her predecessor, Laura Bush, joined forces to campaign about the importance of educating women and girls worldwide.

'You have to change attitudes before you can change behaviors,' Mrs. Obama said.

She noted that some 60 million girls, including 30 million in sub-Saharan Africa, do not attend school.

She also said that until global leaders understand that educating girls is as important as educating boys, 'then we will have a lot of work to do'.

'We do need to make sure worldwide that all women are valued,' added Mrs. Bush.

The two were appearing at President Barack Obama's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.
