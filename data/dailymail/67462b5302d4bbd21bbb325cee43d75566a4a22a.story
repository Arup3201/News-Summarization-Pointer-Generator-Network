It is the question that, among so many in the tumble of
allegation and revelation, just keeps on getting asked. How did she ever get so
close?

How did she get close enough to take classified military documents home as she has now admitted to doing? So close that she felt somehow entitled to send harassing emails to Jill Kelley, telling the Florida socialite to 'back off' the man she clearly considered hers.

Even before Paula Broadwell's affair with General David
Petraeus emerged it was a point which bothered talk-show hosts, perplexed
interviewers and left onlookers faintly bewildered at the string of appearances which constituted
Broadwell's publicity tour for that book, All In.

'I'm gonna go for it', Paula Broadwell's email to Gen Petraeus led to the biography published in January and described by one critic as 'a Valentine' to the 4 star General

A study in strategy: Broadwell stroked her subject's ego with one hand and shored up her credentials with the other

Her own explanation, such as it was, is glib at best. They
met, she repeatedly trotted out, at a dinner for West Point alumni back in
2006.

After dinner there were drinks and at drinks he gave her his business card and they just kept
in touch.

Two years later, in 2008, she was working on a dissertation
on theories of leadership and so, she told Jon Stewart, 'I shot him an email,
and said, "I'm gonna to go for it."'

Petraeus's reaction was to invite her 
well and truly into
his camp - a decision he rues today. He has told his friend Colonel 
Peter Mansoor that he considers his actions, 'morally reprehensible', though, interestingly could not resist a flick of self-defence, pointing
 out that he had 'violated no laws'.

Broadwell promoting her book on the now infamous Jon Stewart interview. 'The real controversy,' he quipped, 'is, is he awesome or incredibly awesome?'

He says he is ignoring the media storm and on Friday will testify before a House Committee on the Benghazi consulate attack. He will do so behind closed doors.

Still, the inescapable fact remains, that for a man of such experience the extent to which he let his guard
down with Broadwell is breathtaking.

But then Broadwell is nothing if not convincing when it
comes to outlining her own credentials and, given the glowing portrait of
'strategic leadership' she penned as Petraeus's biography, nothing if not flattering.

Part Mata-Hari, part Blue-Stocking: Broadwell was, 'an acolyte' never a reporter and an unquestioning devotee of the Gen Petraeus

In one television interview she recalled approaching General
Petraeus and asking him to be a case-study for her dissertation. She wanted to
show, 'What Petraeus's role was in forcing the military to adapt to win the wars we were in'.

'There was no room for a conversation of shortcomings of the
Petraeus theology. She wasn't a reporter. She struck me as an acolyte,' one
advisor to Petraeus is quoted as telling the New York Post.

And while Broadwell stroked her subject's ego with one hand
she shored up her own credibility with the other; part Mata Hari, part
blue-stocking.

Another in the Petraeus camp noted, on meeting her, 'I was
underwhelmed. It was surprising to me that she was his official biographer.'

But, when it came to promoting her book, for Paula
establishing her own academic, military and security credentials came second
only to establishing whether General Petraeus was, as Jon Stewart put it, 'awesome or incredibly awesome'.

She dropped academic qualifications and security clearance
the way a socialite might pepper her conversation with boasts of parties
attended and 'BFFs' made.

According to Broadwell, being embedded in Afghanistan with Petraeus was
not the huge leap many imagined because, she explained, 'We had previously met
through academia’.

She herself was a graduate of West Point and a specialist in counter-terrorism with black ops
experience, high security clearance, 'and then some'. How the suspension of that much vaunted government clearance must smart.

Homecoming Queen 1991, pictured here with her King, Mike McCormick, High School Valedictorian, All-State Basketball star...Broadwell never tires of listing her many achievements.

She was High School Valedictorian, All State Basketball
player, top of her class at West Point, holder of a masters from Harvard...and
how do we know all of this? Because Broadwell has taken great pains to tell us.

We know that her husband Scott Broadwell is not 'just' a
radiologist but an 'interventional radiologist'.

Broadwell and her husband, Scott, just days before the scandal broke. He is not, she relentlessly stresses, just a radiologist but an 'interventionalist radiologist'

Gen Petraeus and his wife, Holly, at the NFL Super Bowl XLII. She had 'lots of good things to say,' on reading Broadwell's biography of her husband

Writing in The New Republic,
Noam Scheiber states, 'When my friend met her, she was fond of pointing out that her husband was
no mere radiologist but a special breed known as as "interventional
radiologist." She would draw out the word "interventional" for emphasis.'

We know that she can run six-minute miles and do hundreds of
press-ups, that she has 13 per cent body fat and is an ironman triathlete and
marathon runner.

We know all this because she has told us. We know that she hosted a charity
BBQ for wounded veterans because she invited Jon Stewart and the assembled
press.

Ferocious self-promoter: Broadwell managed to persuade Jon Stewart to attend a fundraising BBQ for wounded veterans in Charlotte, NC

Meanwhile, until she stopped posting, her Twitter feed was a
dizzying mixture of her following both world-causes and the world-famous.

According to the Times she recently tweeted,'Heading 2 @AspenInstitue 4 the Security Forum
tomorrow! Panel (media & terrorism) followed by a 1v1 run with Lance
Armstrong'.

The political, professional and academic platform on which
she now teeters is one entirely of her own, formidable, construction: itself an
exercise in strategy to rival Petraeus's own.

With breathtaking arrogance, Broadwell let it be known that Petraeus referred to her as, 'his Avvatar'

She has set out her credentials relentlessly with faux
humility, referring to herself as a mere 'mentee' of Petraeus on one hand then
telling the Charlotte Observer in her hometown in North Carolina, ‘Petraeus
once joked I was his Avatar’ a breathtakingly arrogant aside.

Margaret Thatcher once noted that if you had to tell people
you were a lady, you probably weren't. But self-effacement seems the only class
that Paula ever sat out.

And the more impressive Broadwell made herself the more
flattering her interest in Petraeus must surely have been. What better way to
appeal to a man in power than to appeal to his vanity?

A man of 'overachieving impulses and intellectual pretensions:' the vanities to which Broadwell appealed

Noam Scheiber describes Petraeus as a man of 'overachieving
impulses and intellectual pretensions'.

Recognising that, Broadwell seems to have taken those
dubious attributes as her own template for what she described in several
publicity interviews as her 'new path of the soldier-scholar'.

As such she has been a keen writer of
opinion pieces and regular poster on the West Point Alumni Notes page.

Writing in the Boston Globe in 2009 she tackled the issue of
fraternisation between the sexes on the front line, 'Human sexuality will
always present a challenge to organisational discipline. In isolated outposts [it] could
create a situation where issues of sex impede an organization's survival
skills'.

Rather presciently  she concluded, 'Banning sex is
futile and impossible; the best approach is to set rules regarding
fraternization, maintain awareness of relationships within the command, and strictly and fairly discipline transgressors.'

On many occasions Broadwell has noted of Petraeus that he,
'spoke truth to power'.

But if the events of the past week have shown anything it is
that the court of the man known as 'King David,' lacked anyone willing or able
to do the same to him.

Because where Petraeus 'spoke truth to power' Paula wanted
to dissect that power and to get close to it.

Revealingly, in a recent address
to the University of Denver she claimed to have been drawn to the military as an 'instrument of power'
and that she wanted to understand how that instrument worked - presumably so
she could play it.
