Manchester City will complete a £14.5million deal for FC Porto’s defensive midfielder Fernando this week.

City are also expected to confirm the signing of France right-back Bacary Sagna once his contract at Arsenal officially expires.

The 26-year-old Fernando was the subject of a failed bid by City in January and subsequently signed a new contract.

Etihad bound: Manchester City hope to wrap up a transfer for Porto's Fernando

On the move: Bacary Sagna could be confirmed as a Manchester City player in the near future

On the list: Porto's Eliaquim Mangala (left) is also a target for the Premier League champions

City maintain an interest in his 
team-mate Eliaquim Mangala but he wants to wait until after the World Cup
 before determining his future.

City’s
 other target Roma centre-back Mehdi Benatia has been priced at £50m by 
his coach Rudi Garcia but City expect Benatia to push for a move.

Manuel Pellegrini is keen to add to his squad over the summer as City look to defend their Premier League title.
