Downton Abbey star Michelle Dockery says her life has become so entwined with that of her character Lady Mary Crawley that fans of the ITV drama sent her bereavement cards when her on-screen husband Matthew was killed off last Christmas.

The British actress, 31, says she is hugely touched by the 'lovely' investment fans of Julian Fellowes' period drama make with the characters, and that very much enjoys being considered 'part of their lives'.

Speaking to the Observer Magazine, Dockery said: 'People will consider me a part of their lives for however long Downton Abbey lasts. It's a lovely thing to feel as an actor. I get a delivery of letters about once a month. I even had bereavement cards after the last series.'

Lady Mary Crawley's on-screen husband Matthew, played by Dan Stevens, was killed off in a car crash during last year's Christmas special, after the actor decided to pursue a stage and film career in America.

Downton Abbey creator Fellowes waited until Matthew had met his newborn baby - an heir named George - before sending his car careering off the road and into a ditch. The writer was accused by fans of ruining Christmas.

Describing her vertiginous career trajectory as 'surreal', and explaining that she sometimes feels as if she is 'on the outside looking in', Dockery also told the Observer that in real life she sounds nothing like her character.

Speaking to Olly Richards, she said: 'I'm a proud Essex girl. I'll never sound like Lady Mary, although my accent has softened over the years. But it comes back if I've had a couple of drinks or if I'm around my family.'

Michelle
Dockery - known for her portrayal of the very proper Lady Mary Crawley on the 
hit British period drama - has shown her saucy side in a new fashion 
shoot for a magazine.

Appearing
on the cover of Boston Common magazine, Dockery wears a sheer red dress, which she is lifting up as she holds a 
nonchalant gaze.

Inside the magazine, the 31-year-old actress holds another racy pose as she flaunts a red bra beneath a fitted navy coat.

Wearing
red lipstick and matching red leather gloves, it seems the actress is 
keen to prove she's nothing like her on-screen character.

But inside Michelle tells the magazine she does consider Lady Mary to have 'real bite'.

She explains: 'I love playing her because of her behavior at times. I find she can be quite shocking.

'She
has a real bite to her that I love playing, because I don’t think I 
could ever be that way. That’s the joy of being an actor - you can tap 
into those sides of yourself that feel unfamiliar.'

Talking
about how her character Lady Mary is in mourning over the loss of her 
husband (played by Dan Stevens) at the dawn of the new season, she 
reveals how it paralleled how she felt in real life.

'It was just really strange not having Stevens around because three years is a long time to work with someone so closely.

'There
was a real sense of isolation with the character in the first episode 
because Mary has very much retreated. She’s become a bit of a recluse. 
It's almost how it felt for me.'
