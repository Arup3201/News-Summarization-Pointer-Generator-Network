When not even the Prime Minister can afford a decent umbrella then you know for certain that the economy is in trouble.

Truly painting a picture of austerity Britain David Cameron is is forced to use a broken umbrella to shelter Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and himself against the rain earlier today.

Mr Cameron was seen speaking to Ms Suu Kyi, and icon for the Myanmar fight for democracy, in the ground of the Prime Minister's country residence, Chequers, in Ellesborough, Buckinghamshire.

 Ms Suu Kyi and showing her the grounds underneath a broken umbrella – 
perhaps a sign of the times.

After
 a lunch together Mr Cameron and Ms Suu Kyi went for a walk in the Rose 
Gardens following their lunch together and were later joined by the 
Prime Minister’s wife Samantha.

It is the Myanmar pro-democracy leader’s first trip to Europe since her house arrest began in 1988.

During her four day visit to the UK she has so far met with the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street, planted a tree with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and become the first foreign woman to address both houses of Parliament.

Delivering the history speech in Westminster  yesterday the Nobel peace laureate
said she was seeking practical help to address the problems still besetting her
country.

She appealed to Britain ‘as
friend and an equal’ to support the people of Burma in their drive for
democracy.

In particular, she said she hoped the UK could help rebuild
the education system while providing new investment for the future.

‘I am here in part to ask for practical help, help as a
friend and an equal, in support of the reforms which can bring better lives,
greater opportunities, to the people of Burma who have been for so long
deprived of their rights and their place in the world,’ she said.

‘My country today stands at the start of a journey towards,
I hope, a better future. So many hills remain to be climbed, chasms to be
bridged, obstacles to be breached.

‘Our own determination can get us so far. The support of the
people of Britain and of peoples around the world can get us so much further.’

Ms Suu Kyi, who received a standing ovation from MPs and
peers in a packed Westminster Hall, said the key to reform was the
establishment of a strong parlimentary institution.

She said that after 49 years of direct military rule, it
would take time for the country’s fledgling parliament to find its feet and its
voice.

She said Burma had not yet entered the ranks of truly democratic
countries but added: ‘I am confident we will get there before too long, with
your help.’

A
 House of Commons' spokesman confirmed that Ms Suu Kyi was only the 
second woman to address both houses at Westminster Hall, after the 
Queen

When meeting Ms Suu Kyi at 10 Downing Street yesterday Mr Cameron said Britain would be a 'staunch' supporter of
Burma’s steps towards democracy and confirmed that he had also invited President
Thein Sein to visit the UK.

Britain would invest money and people in Burma’s emerging
democracy, he said, including a delegation of MPs and peers visiting the
country next month to 'scope the potential' for building the process.

It would also be investing £3 million in peace-building work
to address ongoing violence in Burma, and increase support each year for
education, healthcare, business and the rule of law.

Appeal: Ms Suu Kyi called on Britain to help Burma become a truly democratic country

'In a world beset by problems and difficulties, your example
of courage and determination has shone through,' he told her.

'If the Burmese people now fulfil their dreams, your country
will be a light in the darkness for all people who struggle for the freedom
that you ought to see for your country.”

Mr Cameron defended his decision to invite Mr Sein to
Britain, saying he believed the president was sincere in his commitment to
reform.

'There is a process of reform in Burma,' the PM said. 'In
order for that to succeed we have to work with the regime.'

Making history: Ms Suu Kyi became only the second woman to address both Houses of Parliament inside Westminster Hall
