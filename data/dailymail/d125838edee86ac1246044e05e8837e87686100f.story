At this most democratic of Open Championships, the warm connection between Phil Mickelson and the fans is quite something to see.

‘All right there Phil, lad,’ was one greeting shouted from Hoylake’s bulging galleries on Friday morning as his lolloping stride came down the sixth fairway in his stellar grouping that also featured Ernie Els and Bubba Watson.

Mickelson is from southern California but
 has sufficient understanding of the Merseyside accent to recognise 
cordiality when he hears it, and responded with a smile and a ‘How ya 
doin?’

Upbeat: Mickelson played with the purpose that suggests he believes he is capable of repeating 2013 triumph

In many sports, defending champions are less preferred than underdogs but not the 44-year-old American, whose general willingness to engage adds to the perception that with the advent of middle age he has matured into a good egg.

He has a man-of-the-people quality that particularly resonates in an area where golf has a strong blue-collar following. The Cinderella story of local qualifier John Singleton being a factory worker has attracted worldwide attention, but there are plenty of men on the shopfloor who enjoy the sport in these parts.

Mickelson got huge support from the bumper crowds, but then he hardly failed to entertain, mixing dazzling mastery of the gusty winds with the odd basic error that showed that he is human like the rest of us.

While Els laboured and Watson spent much of the time with a quizzical look on his face, Mickelson played with the purpose that suggests he believes he is capable of repeating his triumph of Muirfield 2013.

Focused: Bubba Watson and Phil Mickelson tee off on the fifth during the second round on Friday

His morale going into the weekend was lifted by draining a 10-foot putt for birdie on the 18th. Of rediscovering his best form, he said: ‘It’s really close to being good. I’m striking it so good. And if I putt the way I putted the last nine holes then this weekend I’m going to have a good chance. If the wind stays up then I absolutely have a chance.’

Mickelson hit a miraculous second shot to within an inch on the fourth, but his mood had darkened after the seventh, where he missed a birdie putt, and he was still spewing on the next hole, which led him to make a hash of a chip that also cost him. Consequently there was not much banter around the turn, especially after he lost his ball off the tee on the 10th, Hoylake’s best birdie chance. Amends were made when he made an eagle from his provisional, thus saving his par.

He carded a two-under 70, leaving him level par after the first two rounds. The years, the victories and the vagaries of life outside golf have, he said afterwards, made it easier to come to terms with not getting the better of the draw. ‘You accept that as part of the tournament. The conditions I had didn’t allow for it and, rather than force it, I have to play as well as I can with the conditions.

‘I might be seven or eight back but if I try to force it then I’m going to be missing the cut.’

That was the fate of Els, whose Open looked ill-fated from the moment on Thursday’s opening hole when he struck an elderly spectator. Trying to come to terms with the switch back to an orthodox putter from the ghastly broomhandle is not proving easy, and the previous evening he did not leave the putting green until 7.30pm, long after his finish.

Struggle: Ernie Els and Bubba Watson failed to make the cut after two disappointing rounds

His drive off the fifth could have caused a similar accident to day one, because it was so far left it only just cleared the stand for the seventh green before landing in the gorse, sending him back to try again.

Before the tournament Els was effusive about his love for Royal Liverpool, a place where he won as a junior, but he skulked off last night without explaining himself, having scored a 73 for a two-round eight-over 152.

Watson rarely got out his pink driver and a bogey on the last was likely to mean him missing the cut, despite being level for the day and four over for the tournament. He pledged to go back to his digs and commiserate with housemate Webb Simpson, another early departure.

‘I can’t wait to get back home to see my wife and child,’ he said. Unlike Mickelson, who prepared at last week’s Scottish Open, Watson has been out of America for all of seven days. That is clearly more than enough.
