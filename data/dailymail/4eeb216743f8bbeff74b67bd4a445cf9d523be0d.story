Historically, tallying votes has proven to be a challenging task for the state of Florida - and this year's Miss Florida pageant was no exception.

Last week's pageant in St. Petersburg culminated with the crowing of 20-year-old Elizabeth Fechtel as 2014's Miss Florida, which means she was to be the state's representative in this year's Miss America pageant.

Fechtel then reportedly dropped out of school at the University of Florida to 'prepare' for the upcoming Miss America pageant in September. However, she may want to consider re-enrolling because she will not be competing in this year's pageant - after crowing her Miss Florida, pageant officials determined that there had been a scoring error and Fechtel didn't actually win.

The true winner, pageant organizers determined, was Victoria Cowen, who had been named runner-up at the June 21, crowning.

'It was determined there was an error in the tabulation process that 
results in Elizabeth Fechtel being named as Miss Florida 2014. An 
independent review and audit of the scores awarded by the judges 
confirmed that Victoria was the actual recipient of the top overall 
score,' pageant organizers said in a statement given to FOX 13.

Cowen was told she was the winner about midnight on Thursday. She then drove roughly 300 miles from her home in Panama City to retrieve her crown in St. Petersburg on Friday.

'I'm overwhelmed,' Cowen said. 'I'm speechless. I'm beyond every imaginable emotion right now.'

Fechtel also was told about the error on Thursday - but only after she'd spent the last several days going on a media tour, speaking with her hometown media outlets and writing a lengthy 'thank you' note on her Facebook page, in which she said the honor of being crowned Miss Florida was 'life changing.'Â 

Fechtel was obviously upset with the outcome but kept things classy and called Cowen to congratulate her on her win - the two women are friends who have competed in several pageants together, according to Tampabay.com.

Fechtel has not commented on the loss of the crown, but her mother issued a statement to friends, family and media outlets.

'Please give Elizabeth and our family some time to process this information in light of the fact that in these last five days, Elizabeth has dropped out of college, as required, and re-arranged her life to be Miss Florida instead of a UF college student, pursuing the title with vigor! We apologize for any plans you have made based on her being Miss Florida, as we have done so also,' Dixie Fechtel wrote in the statement.

History: Florida has a bit of a history of not being very good at voting, most notably, the 2000 presidential election

Her father, former Florida legislator Vince Fechtel, also weighed in.

'Just like me and her mother, she was extremely upset, for a lot of 
different reasons,' Vince Fechtel said. "We were very concerned that it 
be clear that Elizabeth did nothing wrong, absolutely nothing, and she 
had spent all this time working. We were very distraught.'
