Hillary Clinton's alleged 'enthusiastic pot use' in college and her husband's mistresses are 'open secrets' in political circles, according to the author of an explosive new book on the Clintons.

'It’s sort of surprising how much is out
 in the open, and yet how little is written,' Washington journalist Daniel Halper, author of 'Clinton, Inc', told Radar Online.

'It’s 
not as though DC reporters aren’t aware of Bill Clinton and his 
mistresses, it’s that they don’t cover it. It’s not surprising that 
Hillary Clinton smoked pot, but that nobody would call her out on it.'

Power couple: Weekly Standard editor Daniel Halper has authored an explosive book about Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Clintons are pictured at the New Hampshire Democratic Party 100 Club Dinner in Milford, New Hampshire on January 4, 2008

In his book, Halper quotes Hillary Clinton's former law classmate who claims his friend was a keen marijuana smoker.

'I think she’s acknowledged it, and 
if she hasn’t acknowledged it everybody else will tell you: She was an 
enthusiastic pot user,' the friend told Halper.

The Weekly Standard online editor also claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blackmailed Bill Clinton with tapes of the then-president's steamy phone sex with Monica Lewinsky.

The conservative writer claimed that the British and Russians also ‘scooped up’ the microwaves off the top of the White House and taped Clinton's phone sex conversations with Monica – and perhaps other women.

MailOnline has reached out to the Clintons for comment.

Explosive: Weekly Standard editor Daniel Halper has authored this book on the lives and careers of Bill and Hillary Clinton

Halper has told Radar that while some of these allegations were open secrets in Washington D.C., reporters 'go easy' on the Clintons in order to advance their careers.

'As a reporter you know that if you 
don’t have access it’s much harder to do your job, so a lot of people 
fear for their access and don’t write these things,' he told Radar.

'They’re worried 
they’ll get shunned. Especially in considering she might be the next 
President, why would you pick her off, and her people off right now? It 
wouldn’t be good.'

While Hillary Clinton remains coy on her presidential ambitions, speculation is rife that she is likely to throw her hat in the ring.

However Halper claims in his book that the public have the wrong idea about the Clintons, which may hurt the former secretary of state's presidential chances.

'I think on the one hand Hillary's often portrayed as cold and calculating while Bill was sort of a motive and this bubba-like figure. I found that the opposite is closer to being the case,' Halper told Fox's Megyn Kelly.

'So, Bill tends to be more cold and more calculating while Hillary tends to have long-time friends and have actual relationships and is sort of a more complicated figure.'

Halper told Radar that he still has more Clinton secrets to spill which could derail Hillary's 2016 presidential run: I’m just gonna leave it at that. Stay tuned!'
