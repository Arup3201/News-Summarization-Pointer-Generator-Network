A Sydney mayor who was allegedly assaulted at a polling booth on Saturday afternoon has been released from hospital after he was reportedly 'king hit'.

Bill Pickering - who is the mayor of Ryde in Sydney's northwest - said he barely saw the punch coming but said it will take a few days to get over the shock.   

Mr Pickering, 52, said he can identify the man who assaulted him at Putney Public school on Saturday but he declined to give specifics because a police investigation is underway.

'I had an MRI scan, everything's OK neurologically,' he told reporters on Sunday.

'Obviously there's swelling and other things, but nothing I won't recover from in a couple of days.' 

Mr Pickering was handing out sandwiches when he was allegedly confronted by independent candidate Vic Tagg, deputy mayor Roy Maggio told Nine News.

It is believed the mayor then fell to the ground and had a seizure.

Mr Pickering said he was talking to a couple when he was approached and only just saw the punch coming.

'A couple were being berated, I went to speak to them and then obviously the incident that you're now aware of occurred'. 

'It was too late to react,' he said.

independent candidate Vic Tagg denied that he was responsible for Saturday's attack telling Seven News that he was 'going to speak to his solicitor'.

Tagg said he snapped when mayor Pickering approached him at the booths and called him 'corrupt' and a 'crook'

Cr Maggio, who was also at Putney Public School for a council by-election today, says the mayor was 'king hit'. 

'He [Mr Tagg] king hit him [Cr Pickering] front on and the mayor fell down,' Liberal Cr Maggio told Nine News.

Witnesses say Cr Pickering - a member of the Liberal party - was handing out sandwiches to voters at a council polling booth for Ryde's East Ward by-election, when Mr Tagg claimed the Liberal party was 'corrupt' before allegedly punching the mayor.

The by-election was prompted by the resignation of former mayor and independent councillor Ivan Petch in December.

Mr Petch withdrew his position from council after the Independent Commission against Corruption made corrupt conduct findings against him. 

The results of the by-election are expected to be released on Tuesday.  

A police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia inquiries are continuing as they are currently questioning a number of witnesses.

No arrests have been made.

Police were called to the school on Morrison Road at about 2pm today, following reports of an assault.

'Initial investigations suggest that a 52-year-old man was assaulted by another man known to him, who left the school before police arrived,' a police spokesperson said.

Cr Pickering was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to Ryde Hospital.

Fellow Liberal councillor Craig Chung told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked when he heard about the alleged assault.

'Violence of any sort is a terrible blight on our democracy and violence allegedly from a candidate is just deplorable,' he said.

Cr Chung said the mayor spent the night in hospital. 

Police are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward.
