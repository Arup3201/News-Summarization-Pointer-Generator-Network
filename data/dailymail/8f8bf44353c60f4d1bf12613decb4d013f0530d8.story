Wedding season really picks up speed in June, which means May is the most popular time for hen and stag parties to celebrate a partner's last night of freedom before their big day.

And this year things are getting bigger, wilder and costlier than ever before in that department, as a record 220,000 will be attending bachelor/ette parties in the UK this month, injecting Â£60m into local economies.

The money will be spread across bars, restaurants, travel, accommodation, 
activities and fashion, with hordes donning fancy dress costumes, embarking on 
adventurous group outings and partying the night away on 
organised hen and stag events.

And the most popular destinations include Bournemouth, Nottingham and 
Newcastle for stag parties and London, Brighton and Bristol for hens.

Party planning experts chillisauce.co.uk 
have predicted the busiest month for stag and hen parties in more than a
decade, estimating more than 220,000 revellers will descend on popular destinations around the country.

Chillisauce CEO James Baddiley said: 'We have been organising hen and stag events for more than 10 years and we have never had so many groups out at once.

'With more and more people opting for an organised stag or hen party and June being the beginning of wedding season, it seems May is always a favourable time to plan a hen or stag weekend.

'Despite the recent recession we have seen continual growth in our industry and I think this is definitely set to continue.

'It is good news for local economies too, with partygoers spending money on local accommodation, transport, activities and events, as well as splashing their cash in bars and restaurants.'

Celebrations reach a peak in May as it is close to the start of the traditional wedding season, which kicks off in earnest in June, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
