As property prices in London continue to skyrocket, with an average home in the centre of the city now costing £641,000, it will come as little surprise to learn that you can save money by moving out of the capital and commuting back in.

In fact, property within London travel zones one and two is now so expensive that by moving just ten minutes away, buyers save an average of £276,000.
