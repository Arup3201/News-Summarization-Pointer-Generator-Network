The Royal Mint today unveiled a coin to celebrate the Chinese year of the sheep in 2015.

The coin - available in gold and silver - features Chinese symbols and the Yorkshire Swalendale sheep and has been designed by artist Wuon-Gean Ho.

The collectable, which marks the 2015 year of the sheep, is the second in the collection, and prices start at £82.50.

Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coins at The Royal Mint said: 'Following on from the hugely popular Year of the Horse coins range, of which three quarters were sold out in the first few months, The Royal Mint is happy to be bringing its craftsmanship and artistic skills to this latest coin in the collection.'

'Supporting the centuries-old tradition of giving zodiac coins at the Lunar New Year, we’re expecting to see similar demand this year for Wuon Gean’s stunning design.'

Last month, the Mint announced that a silver £20 coin has been produced to mark 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War.

Designed by sculptor John Bergdahl, it depicts the figure of Britannia watching over the first troops leaving for France in 1914.

On the back, it features the current portrait of the Queen.

The coin has been minted in fine silver and 250,000 will be issued.

The Mint said the coin, which is only the second UK £20 coin it has ever made, has been struck to remember the bravery of those who answered the call to fight for king and country a century ago.

The first UK £20 coin was released last year to celebrate the birth of Prince George.

That coin, which featured a St George and the Dragon design, was also limited to a run of 250,000 and has sold out.
