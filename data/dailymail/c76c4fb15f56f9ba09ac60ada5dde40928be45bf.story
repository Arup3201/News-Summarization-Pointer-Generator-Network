Former world 100 metres champion Tyson Gay makes his return from a one-year drugs ban in Lausanne on Thursday night against two US relay team-mates who could yet lose their Olympic medal as a result of his cheating.

The men’s 4x100m relay team, including Ryan Bailey and Justin Gatlin, have not been told if they will be stripped of silver from London 2012 after Gay handed back his medal following three positive tests for a banned anabolic steroid last year.

Gay admitting to doping from July 2012 but had the standard two-year ban cut to a year after ‘truthfully co-operating’ with authorities.

Return: Tyson Gay will make his comeback on Thursday following a drugs ban

Athletics’ world governing body, the IAAF, stipulates the whole team should be disqualified if any athlete fails a drugs test. But the decision lies with the International Olympic Committee, who have yet to decide whether to upgrade Trinidad and Tobago to silver behind champions Jamaica.

Gay races Bailey and Gatlin over 100m in Thursday night’s Diamond League meeting, with both men unsure whether they will lose their medals.

Bailey, 25, said: ‘Personally I haven’t been told anything so until then it’s my medal and you can’t take it from me.’

Gatlin, the 2004 100m Olympic champion, served a four-year ban himself after failing his second drugs test in 2006, but dismissed suggestions the race was tarnished by the presence of two former drugs cheats.

The 32-year-old said: ‘If we are saying this race should not be happening because of my past discretions then I should not have been at the World Championships or the Olympics.

'And I have no power to say what races Tyson can run in. If he’s here and I line up against him I can’t complain. I’ve just got to go out there and do my job.’

Gatlin said Gay was still a ‘worthy opponent’ at 31 but was vague when asked whether the one-year ban seemed unfairly lenient. He did, however, admit Gay would be feeling the pressure in Lausanne.

Speaking from experience: Justin Gatlin was banned for four years for using performance-enhancing drugs

‘I wish Tyson luck because it can be a stressful time, not only on the track but in how people think  about you and how they look at you,’ said Gatlin. ‘It’s probably going to  be with him for the rest  of his career.’

Gatlin is targeting Yohan Blake’s 2012 meeting record of 9.69sec —  a time which doubles as Gay’s USA record — while Great Britain’s James Dasaolu will only have eyes on the clock when he opens his season in the B race.

His needs to run 10.20sec, the qualifying time to make the British team for the European Championships in Zurich next month.
