Eye of the storm: The drill bit on the Curiosity was screwed in to place in an unsterile environment - sparking fears we may end up 'seeding Mars with life'

When the Curiosity finally extends its drill and bites into the dusty surface of the Red Planet, Nasa scientists will be quietly hoping that the Mars rover will not find ice beneath the surface.

For if it does, it will blow open a scandal that has been 'simmering' inside Nasa for the last year: the fact that the drill bits may well be infected with Earth bacteria - bacteria which could survive on Mars.

The possible contamination occurred six months ago, when engineers peeked inside the drill mechanism without permission in order to attach one more piece.

If the drill touches water, there is every chance the bacteria could live.

This would be a crisis for Nasa: to meddle with the biological make-up of planet which, for all we know so far, may still have native microbes of its own kind.

According to the LA Times, Nasa does 
not expect to find water - the space agency chose the dry equatorial 
landing site in Mars' Gale Crater to study the planet's geology, not in a
bid to find water or ice.

But,
the paper adds: 'If by chance the rover Curiosity does find H2O, a 
controversy that has simmered at NASA for nearly a year will burst into 
the open.'

The potential 
contamination occurred on November 26 last year, after the drill bits 
had been sterilised and placed in a box, which would not be opened again
until a successful touchdown on Mars.

But
engineers were worried that a rough landing could damage the drill bits
- and opened the box to add one more drill bit and increase their 
chances of success.

According
to the LA Times, the engineers screwed the drill bit directly into the 
drill - so that if the loading mechanism failed, Curiosity at least had 
one shot of a successful dig.

The
paper adds that under Nasa's procedures, the box should not have been 
opened without 'the knowledge of a NASA scientist who is responsible for
guarding Mars against contamination from Earth'

But
Planetary protection officer Catharine Conley told the paper: 'They 
shouldn't have done it without telling me - it is not responsible for us
not to follow our own rules.'

The
blunder was apparently spotted before launch, but - as it was too close
to launch - Nasa officials took a 'calculated risk' to send Curiosity 
onwards.

David Lavery, 
program executive for solar system exploration, said: 'Water or ice near
the surface in Gale Crater was not a significant probability.

'We weighed that against the risks of not having a bit mounted in the drill prior to launch, and the specter of not being able to drill any holes at all on Mars.

'Of course, there is always a possibility that Mars will surprise us.'

He added that the box was unsealed in a near-sterile environment, and Nasa later altered the mission scenario to say that Curiosity could interact with the surface of Mars 'as long as there is no ice or water'.

Lastly, the LA Times spoke to John D. Rummel, a professor of biology at East Carolina University, who said: 'It will be a sad day for NASA if they do detect ice or water.

'That's because the Curiosity project will most likely be told, "Gee, that's nice. Now turn around".'

Many microbes have proven - both through controlled tests and accidental exposure - that they can survive the vacuum and cosmic radiation of space, and at least one species has survived Martian-like conditions in the laboratory.

Nasa today revealed stunning new images of Curiosity's wheel on the martian surface taken using the high resolution Mahli camera, which had its dustcover removed for the first time
