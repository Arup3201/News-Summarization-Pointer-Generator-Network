The Easter plans of millions of Britons were washed away yesterday as rain and thunderstorms swept the country.

Southern counties suffered under the worst of the downpours, with some areas seeing a week’s rainfall in less than 24 hours.

It left families hoping to enjoy the first holiday weekend of the year reaching for their brollies and wellingtons or remaining tucked up indoors.

A turn for the worse: Britain will be lashed by some of the worst Easter rains and thunderstorms in tens years. Above, a couple walk along a beach in Southsea

Dismal: Forecasters are predicting heavy rain in parts of the country, with thunder and lightning in coastal regions. Above, a woman walks along Southsea beachfront

Kitted up: Southern areas of the UK, such as Kent, Sussex, Dorset and Portsmouth (pictured), are expected to be the worst hit - with more than an inch of rain forecast

Today’s forecast is a little brighter, but there is still a risk of thunderstorms and the outlook remains unsettled.

Although
 the North escaped the worst of yesterday’s rain, high winds caused 
problems. Four people, including a child, were injured when a tree fell 
at a pub in Hindley, near Wigan, that was hosting a fun day.

A
 seven-year-old boy was treated for a broken leg when the tree was 
uprooted and fell close to a bouncy castle at The Hockery Brook. Two 
women, aged 23 and 26, and a 23-year-old man were also hurt.

Hull’s
 home match against Arsenal in the Premier League was brought to a 
standstill shortly after kick-off when high winds blew advertising 
hoardings on to the pitch.

Morning stroll: The weather could mean a washout forpeople planning outdoor Easter celebrations. Above, a couple walk their dog along a beach in Southsea

Staying warm: A family surveys the rainy, wet and cold weather from their beach hut in Bournemouth, with temperatures predicted to peak at just 15C (59F)

Lucky few: The Met Office said showers would sweep across the south of England. Above, Loch Morlich near Aviemore in Scotland, where the weather was warmer

Difference: The rain follows days of glorious sunshine across Britain, particularly in the south. Above, sun-seekers punt on the River Cam in Cambridge yesterday

Making the most of the sun: Meterologist Charles Powell, of the Met Office, said: 'Most people across the UK have enjoyed warm, settled weather over the past few days'

Much
 of the South Coast fell dark under violent thunderstorms, leaving 
popular resorts almost deserted. Bournemouth’s seven-mile stretch of 
sands was virtually empty as temperatures dropped to just 10C (50F) – 
well below the average for April.

At
 Highclere Castle in Hampshire, where Downton Abbey is filmed, rain 
pelted down on children taking part in an Easter egg hunt. The all-day 
event was blighted by thunder and lightning, as crowds sought shelter in
 the shadow of the historic home.

A low pressure front that swept in from Germany was to blame.

‘It
 was a different weather pattern to normal, with the weather moving 
westwards due to last week’s high pressure,’ said Met Office forecaster 
Charles Powell.

‘The wettest places were central and southern parts and around Dorset.’

He
 said today should be ‘slightly better’, but after a decent start 
thundery showers may develop, starting in Wales and moving 
south-eastwards towards Sussex.

Crowded: On Friday, members of the public flocked to Brighton beach (pictured) in Sussex to bathe in the glorious Easter sunshine, which has now given way to rain

Promising start: Easter's rainfall will be bad news to the thousands of people who invested in disposable barbecues. Above, a man relaxes on Brighton beach on Friday

‘The outlook remains unsettled for the rest of the week,’ added Mr Powell.

It
 seems that the best that holidaymakers can hope for today is a 
trouble-free journey home, but motoring groups are warning of traffic 
jams on many of the major routes.

An estimated 18million motorists travelled on the roads this weekend, according to the RAC.

The
 M5 is likely to be problematic today, with a bottleneck around Bristol.
 Further jams are expected on the M3 from Southampton, the A303 from the
 South West, the M23 from Brighton, the M25 and the M6 from the Lake 
District.

Jennifer Hart, 
from the Highways Agency, said a number of roadworks have been lifted to
 ease congestion but added: ‘We are predicting that Easter Monday 
afternoon will be busier than usual as people head back on the main 
holiday routes home.’

Engineering work on the railways could also affect journeys home, with work being carried out at more than 3,000 locations.
