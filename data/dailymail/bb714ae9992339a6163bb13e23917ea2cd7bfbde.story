A four-year-old girl has died after a train hit the car she was in at a level crossing.

An investigation is under way to discover why the Volvo carrying Emma Lifsey was on the line.

She was taken to hospital after the crash, but her injuries were so severe that staff were unable to save her.

British Transport Police said a train
collided with a car at the Beech Hill crossing on Springs Road, Mission
Springs, Nottinghamshire, at 12.35pm yesterday.

Emergency
services were called to the isolated level crossing, which has barriers
and flashing lights, in the middle of a huge stretch of flat farmland 
at Beech Hill.

The 67-year-old driver suffered severe neck injuries and  was taken by ambulance 
to nearby Doncaster Royal Infirmary, while youngster Emma LIfsey was taken by air 
ambulance to Sheffield Children’s Hospital.

In a statement issued through British
Transport Police, Emma’s parents, Mark and Zoe Lifsey, aged 40 and 38 
and from Haxey, said: 'Emma meant the world to us. She was our 
much-loved daughter and a baby sister to her 11-year-old brother Jack.

'We are still trying to come to terms with the terrible incident on Tuesday afternoon and there are no words that can properly express how utterly distraught we are.

'We would like to thank everyone for the many messages of sympathy and support we have received.

'As you can appreciate, this tragic incident has left us shocked and devastated and we would ask that we can be left to grieve in private at this acutely difficult and sad time for us.'

The BTP spokesman said: 'The police investigation into the incident is ongoing and remains very much in the early stages.

'Officers are working hard to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident, including how the vehicle came to be on the tracks at the time.

'This will include speaking to any witnesses to the incident, while specialist officers will also look at evidence from the scene and the car in question, a black Volvo which has now been recovered.

Crash horror: Emergency services rushed to the scene to investigate the incident

The collision happened in Finningley near Doncaster, South Yorkshire

'The train, a Lincoln to Doncaster 
service, was damaged but remained upright and on the tracks. There have 
been no reports of injuries to passengers or staff onboard.

'The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) and Office of Rail Regulation have been notified.'

East Midlands Trains, which runs the Lincoln to Doncaster service, offered its condolences to Emma’s family and said it is working closely with the police and Network Rail to support the investigation.

David Horne, the company’s managing director, said: 'Our thoughts are with the parents of Emma Lifsey and their loved ones at this very difficult time.

'We will be doing everything possible in the days ahead to assist the investigation into identifying the cause of this tragic incident.

'Work is continuing this morning to move the train from the incident site to allow normal services to start running again.'

Network Rail’s route managing director, Phil Verster, said: 'At this sad time, Network Rail’s thoughts are with the family of Emma Lifsey.

'We are all trying to understand what happened and are working closely with the investigating authorities to find the answers.'

An East Midlands Trains spokesperson said: 'The incident happened at approximately 12.35 and involved the 11.54 East Midlands Trains service from Lincoln to Doncaster.

'The train remained upright on the tracks at all times.

'Our first priority and thoughts are for those involved in the incident. Our staff ensured that passengers were safely escorted from the train and these passengers will be taken forward to Doncaster by alternative road transport.

'We will work with Network Rail and the British Transport Police to ensure those involved in this incident are given every assistance.'

The spokesman added that a bus service is operating on the affected route between Lincoln and Doncaster.

A National Rail worker posting on Twitter said thanks to a local who had given drinks to the evacuated and shocked passengers.

As night descended BTP erected flood lights as several police continue examining and clearing the area. The car remains at the scene.

The level crossing is one protected by double barriers and is not manually operated.

A local farmer, who did not wish to be named, said: 'The level crossing is a really obvious one, I can't see how this could have really happened other than somebody skidding into and breaking through it. It seems really odd to me.'
