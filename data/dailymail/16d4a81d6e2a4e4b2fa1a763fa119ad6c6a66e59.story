Long wait: Justin Welby said setting up credit unions to compete with controversial lenders such as Wonga will take 'major skills and much time'

The Church of England’s rival to payday loan companies will not be ready to do business for more than ten years, the Archbishop of Canterbury admitted yesterday.

Justin Welby said setting up credit unions to compete with controversial lenders such as Wonga will take ‘major skills and much time’.

His admission amounts to a second climbdown since he promised to ‘compete Wonga out of existence’.

His criticism of the company last month was rapidly followed by the disclosure that the Church’s pension fund had invested money in one of Wonga’s financial backers.

The Archbishop said the responses to Lambeth Palace following his remarks on payday lenders had been ‘overwhelmingly positive’.

However, he added: ‘Talk is cheap – and my job involves a lot of it – but the challenge is in delivery.

'The result of the interest in how the Church plans to support credit unions is that there is now, quite rightly, pressure to deliver. And it feels quite scary.

'Putting together the partnerships and logistics to have a good product, piloting it and learning from the results, and then turning it into something effective: This needs major skills and much time – at least a decade, in fact.’

The Archbishop made the admission in a blog published by Lambeth Palace while he was away on a brief visit to Guatemala.

‘I often admire politicians for putting themselves in a place which demands they turn words into reality. It is easy for me to criticise people from the sidelines; they are the ones trying to make things happen,’ he wrote.

Archbishop Welby opened his attack on Wonga in an interview in which he declared: ‘I’ve met the head of Wonga and we had a good conversation and I said to him bluntly, “We’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence, we’re trying to compete you out of existence”.’

He suggested that 16,000 churches could form the basis of a network of non-profit lending organisations.
