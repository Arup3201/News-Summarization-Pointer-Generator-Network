In custody: Monique Dillard-Bothuell has been arrested on gun charges, but may face more accusations related to the disappearance of Charlie Bothuell V

The stepmother of the 12-year-old Detroit boy missing for 11 days until being found in the basement of his father's home knew he was down there, police have revealed.

Monique Dillard-Bothuell barricaded young Charlie Bothuell V behind boxes and told him 'not to come out, no matter what he hears,' the boy told police, according to court documents filed after she was arrested Thursday.

Prosecutors also revealed the boy's body is covered in scars from prior abuse, including one sustained from father Charlie Bothuell IV 'driving a PVC pipe into his chest' as punishment for a transgression, authorities said.

Investigators found a bloody PVC pipe in the home, and 'Mr. Bothuell disclosed physically disciplining Charlie V with [it],' police said.

Blood found on the boy's clothes has not immediately been explained, but the reportedly abusive father's lawyer claimed to police it was from eczema.

'He scratched it like crazy,' said attorney Mark Magidson.

The boy, who was found stashed behind 'boxes and totes,' also claimed his stepmother would not bring him food, according to the Detroit Free-Press, which reviewed the court petition.

'Charlie reports sneaking upstairs to get food when everyone left the home,' the filing said.

A separate petition filed in juvenile court further detailed the boy's treatment in the house of horrors.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Dark passage: Exiting the basement door from his father's apartment - No. 1344 on the right - Charlie Bothuell V walked to his right down the tunnel. The storage closet is to the right, and the exit door, which was oddly left open is further down the corridor

Hiding out: This is the first picture of the storage closet in the basement of the condominium townhouse where it is believed Charlie Bothuell V hid out during the eleven days he was missing

Found: Charlie Bothuell V was found hiding in his father's basement after he'd been missing for 11 days

Charlie's grandmother told the FBI 'he 
was very skinny, and almost looked like a cancer patient. He had marks 
all over his arms and chest' the last time she saw him.'

These latest developments led 
authorities to remove the couple's two younger children from their care 
and place them into protective custody.

Since
 his discovery, Charlie’s stepmom has been arrested on gun charges, her 
two younger children have been taken into care and Charles IV has not 
been able to see his son as police have taken him to live with his 
mother.

There have been suggestions that 
abuse charges may be brought by prosecutors and allegations that his 
father and stepmom may have somehow been involved in his disappearance. 
His father has angrily denied the claims, calling them, ‘absurd’.

But
 neighbors in the upmarket condo building close to downtown Detroit have
 said they believe Charlie simply ran away and used the tunnel to come 
and go as he pleased.

One 
neighbor even said the home-schooled pre-teen had been spotted out playing 
basketball in the neighborhood while law enforcement and family carried
 out their desperate search.

Missing: The townhouse in Detroit where Charlie Bothuell V was found alive on June 25

Escape: The door at the end of the tunnel - at the bottom of the stairs - was open all last week because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster. That means Charlie could have come and gone as he pleased. It is usually locked from the outside

One 
neighbor even said the home-schooled pre-teen had been spotted out playing 
basketball in the neighborhood while law enforcement and family carried
 out their desperate search.

MailOnline was granted exclusive access to the long corridor that joins all the condos and leads to the outside world.

The
 outside door is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men, 
but last week it was apparently left open so residents could get 
rid of a build-up of trash in a dumpster left outside.

That
 means Charlie could have left the property in the day, before returning
 at night. That would explain why FBI agents with search dogs could not 
find the boy during their exhaustive searches.

There
 is also a communal storage space – seen in our pictures – where 
neighbors believe he could have easily hidden. There is even an 
accessible bathroom in the tunnel. 

Dad under fire: Charles Bothuell IV leaves the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice on Friday after a court hearing for his wife, Monique Dillard-Bothuell

Speaking
 to MailOnline, the neighbor, who did not want to be named, said: 
‘As far as I am concerned this kid ran away, then he was found and 
that’s it.

‘He ran away two
 years ago, that has been in the news, so it doesn’t take a genius to 
work out that the most obvious explanation here is that he ran away 
again.

‘I have heard he 
was seen by some of the local kids playing basketball on at least one 
occasion. The door at the end of the tunnel was open all last week 
because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster. That means he 
could have come and gone as he pleased.

‘In
 my opinion he was going out in the day, messing around, eating and then
 coming back to stay in the corridor or in his basement at night. There 
is even a bathroom down there for him to use.

A place to hide: Charlie probably called this storage closet home for over a week and he had access to bathroom facilities - and the outside

’He
 could have lasted down there for as long as he wanted. I don’t know his
 parents that well, but they seemed like nice people to me.’

Despite
 the neighbor’s assertions, there is still a significant amount of 
suspicion surrounding Charlie’s parents, with many suggesting he would 
not have been able to stay hidden without an adult’s involvement.

Stepmom
 Monique Dillard-Bothuell was arrested on Thursday after apparently 
violating parole relating to a previous arrest on a gun charge.

Authorities
 had obtained a warrant for Monique Bothuell's arrest on Monday, but 
held out until Thursday to take her into custody later claiming the 
search for Charlie took priority.

Relief: Charlie was able to use a toilet located in the tunnel

The
 37-year-old had pleaded guilty to purchasing a pistol without a permit 
earlier this year and had been put on a two-year probation period.

She was in court today on the gun charge and released on a $5,000 personal bond and ordered to wear a monitoring device.

Arrest: Monique Dillard-Bothuell is arraigned for a probation violation of weapons charges at Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in Detroit on Friday, two days after her stepson was found in her basement

Back with mom: Charlie is now staying with his birth mother

Sources
 have suggested that Charles IV, a registered nurse, is a strict disciplinarian, who made Charlie follow strict education and 
workout schedules.

NBC news
 reported that Charlie was made to complete 4,000 strides on an 
elliptical trainer without break, possibly on a daily basis.

The day of his disappearance he 
took a break from his routine and his stepmother reported him to his dad, NBC reported. 
Charlie was reportedly afraid of his father’s reaction and decided to 
run away.

Police sources told WJBK that Charles IV allegedly beat his son with a PVC pipe. Blood was reportedly found in the boy's room.

Following his 
disappearance on June 14th, Charles IV and Charlie’s biological mother 
Africa Shippings who lives around two miles away both made emotional 
television pleas for their boy’s safe return. Apparently Charlie would 
split his time between his father’s and his mother’s homes.

Stunned: Charlie Bothuell IV was shocked into silence on Wednesday when HLN's Nancy Grace told him his 12-year-old son had been found alive in his basement, 11 days after he vanished

Charles
 IV was on live television on HLN with Nancy Grace on Wednesday when he 
learned that his son had been found in the home's basement.

'We're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement,' Grace said.

As
 the shocked father struggled to comprehend the news - grabbing his 
chest and looking stunned - Grace demanded to know whether or not he had
 checked his basement.

'I 
checked my basement,' Bothuell said. 'The FBI checked my basement. The 
police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down 
there several times. We've all been checking.'

He
 said that authorities had even brought in dogs to check the basement, but the boy had not been found.

Detroit
 Police Chief James Craig said when police found the boy, he appeared to
 be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did not announce 
himself.

Craig said that he
 believes it is unlikely that the boy could have constructed the barrier
 himself. He was also behind a large plastic drum and bedding was found 
nearby.

Overwhelmed: Bothuell clutched his chest and breathed heavily after learning that his son had been found

'There's no way he 
could have erected this make-shift area of concealment, I'll call it,' 
Craig told WJBK. 'He certainly was excited to see us. I had a chance to 
actually talk  to and embrace Charlie.

'He indicated he was hungry. He appeared fine.'

Craig
 told reporters earlier Wednesday that the boy's father had taken a 
polygraph test about his son's disappearance, but the boy's stepmother 
declined to do so.

Mr Bothuell's test came back inconclusive, WDIV reported.

He also told authorities that Charlie had ran away from home two years ago, but police found him after three hours

Charlie Bothuell, who was last seen when he took a break from working out and went to the bathroom, was discovered as authorities searched the home.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig said 
when police found the boy, he appeared to be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did 
not announce himself.
