Tiger Woods was all smiles on Tuesday - thanks to a full set of teeth.

Woods gave a play-by-play of getting his front tooth knocked out last week when he was in Italy to celebrate girlfriend Lindsey Vonn breaking the World Cup ski record. 

The golfer chatted with the media during a practice round at the Waste Management Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale in Arizona on Tuesday.

Missing something? Tiger Woods lost one of his front teeth after a cameraman knocked it out last week before he congratulated his skier girlfriend Lindsey Vonn on her win at the women's World Cup in Italy

He said he was wearing his skeleton-patterned mask to try to blend in and was standing behind photographers at one of two podium presentations. 

Woods said a videographer stood up and banged into his mouth, adding the mask covered the blood and he was in pain.

Woods said one tooth was chipped and the other was knocked out. They were permanent teeth — not caps - and he had them replaced.

A race official said he was not aware of the incident and nothing was reported.

Nicola Colli, secretary general of the organizing committee in Cortina D'Ampezzo, also claimed last week to have been alongside Woods during the so-called crush of paparazzi his agent claimed caused him to lose a tooth.

'I was among those who escorted him from the tent to the snowmobile and there was no such incident,' Colli said. 

'When he arrived he asked for more security and we rounded up police to look after both him and Lindsey.'  

The golfer revealed the gap in his mouth as he congratulated Vonn following her winning run- her 63rd World Cup victory. 

'During a crush of photographers at the awards' podium at the World Cup event in Italy, a media member with a shoulder-mounted video camera pushed and surged towards the stage, turned and hit Tiger Woods in the mouth,' Woods' agent Mark Steinberg said.

'Woods's tooth was knocked out by the incident.'

The identity and network of the camera operator was not included in the statement, nor was it clear what Steinberg claims became of the tooth. 

Previous pictures of the golfer show the tooth that was knocked out was discolored.
