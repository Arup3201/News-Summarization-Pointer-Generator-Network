Strawberries and cream... bread and butter... tea and biscuits... some things just go together. But cheese and compression bandages? Yoghurt and head torches? Not so much.

Of course, this hasn’t deterred staff at the Walton-on-Thames branch of Aldi from displaying them proudly, side-by-side.

It’s fair to say the shop’s displays don’t make much sense — but then there’s not much about the German discount supermarket that does.

New territory: Claudia Connell does her grocery shop at her local Waitrose. This week, she went to her nearest branch of Aldi to see what all the fuss is about

From the bizarre items they stock (‘Would you like a bicycle saddle with your baguette, Madam?’) to the chaotic layout and infuriating lack of assistants, Aldi seems, at first glance, to offer a gruelling shopping experience.

It is certainly a far cry from the glossy Waitrose store I usually frequent. 

Yet now seems the time to sweep supermarket snobbery aside and give Aldi a chance.

For last week it emerged as the overall winner in a taste test of own-brand foods conducted by trade magazine The Grocer.

Aldi came out top in 16 categories — more than Waitrose and M&S combined — with gold medals for everything from its bacon to its brioche.

With praise such as this, not to mention bargain prices, it’s no wonder the middle classes are hot-footing it there in droves and that Aldi, which originally targeted more socially deprived areas, is now opening up in Newbury, Winchester, Ely and Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

With no branches near my home in South London, I head off to a store in Walton-on-Thames, the sort of town where ladies lunch and gents play golf.

There, standing out like a sore thumb beneath the shadow of 12th-century St Mary’s church, lies Aldi. It looks like the sort of council-run place where you’d go to get a verruca removed. 

The inside isn’t much better, with strip lighting that fails to lift the gloom and piles of stock in the middle of aisles making it hard to navigate my wobbly trolley.

At 9.30am, the twinset and pearl shoppers are nowhere to be seen. Instead, the store is full of pensioners all making a beeline for the famous ‘special buy’ section, where you can get all sorts of strange stuff (such as the aforementioned compression bandages and head torches). 

But I have to admit the food is impressive. A 200g punnet of cherries — a fruit that usually costs more than gold — is £1.79, and they look impossibly juicy. 

As well as the cherries, there’s English rhubarb for 69p, a pack of four avocados at £1.49 and on-the-vine tomatoes for 69p.

Middle class destination: Shoppers who favour Waitrose are heading to Aldi to buy alcohol

Illogical: Aldi is known for scattered and confused displays, that mix clothes, toiletries and fresh food together

Bagged salad is also good value. A generous bag of baby leaf salad is just 79p, as is the rocket.

There
are plenty more middle-class staples available too: brie, Parma ham, 
chorizo, houmous and fresh pesto are all present and correct in the 
chiller cabinet.

In most 
cases, there’s only one type of each — but there’s actually something 
quite liberating about not having to dither over 16 different 
varieties. 

The choice of 
teas, coffees and breakfast cereals is similarly limited but includes 
Diplomat teabags — one of the lines Aldi has just won an award for.

At £1.39 for 60, they’re nearly half the price of the Twinings Everyday Tea I usually drink.

Aldi
has also been much praised for its bread and baked goods, and I have to
say the range is not only impressive but crazily cheap.

Four
delicious-looking all-butter croissants are only 55p, while the gold 
medal-winning French Marble brioche looks irresistibly fluffy.

All shoppers have their items that they are just not prepared to skimp on — and for me it’s chicken and loo rolls.

At £3.99 for four breast fillets, the chicken is the cheapest I’ve seen for a long time — but it just doesn’t look very nice.

It’s not free-range, and I suspect that by the time it comes out of the oven the pumped-up breast will have shrunk to a bite-size dog treat.

As for the loo roll, well let’s just say I’ve seen sandpaper that looked softer.

I try to remind myself that beggars can’t be choosers, and that while I’m not exactly on the breadline, I could do with trimming back my food bill.

Although I live alone, I spend around £85 on my weekly shop at Waitrose — and that rarely includes red meat or alcohol. 

Aldi has been found to be 40 per cent cheaper than Waitrose — and an annual saving of £1,700 isn’t to be sniffed at. That’s two weeks in Spain. 

An hour into my Aldi shop, I am beginning to spy the odd well-heeled Surrey wife: their immaculately blow-dried hair, J Brand jeans and Tod’s loafers are a dead giveaway.

Appeal: The middle classes are said to be rushing to Aldi for wine and gin. Bottles of £3.69 red wine don't stay on the shelves for long. The wine has been voted one of the best in the world

Taste the difference: Aldi has won an award for its Diplomat teabags. But Claudia Connell still prefers Twinings

However, rather than buying their entire weekly shop at Aldi, they are nipping in for one item. Booze.

Heading to an aisle stacked high with wines, beers and spirits, I feel I’ve uncorked the secret to Aldi’s success. 

Alcohol
is something that Aldi does well. When their £3.69 Spanish red wine 
Toro Loco Tempranillo was voted one of the best in the world last year, 
you couldn’t get it for love nor money. Today they have a supply in but 
it’s going fast. 

I grab a 
bottle and get chatting to 66-year-old Gillian Jones, who has come 
straight from her tennis lesson and is still dressed in her whites. 

‘I only come in for the gin,’ she tells me. ‘It’s the best I’ve ever tasted, and so much cheaper than brands like Gordon’s.’

She’s
right about the gin. In blind taste-tests, Aldi’s Oliver Cromwell 
London Dry Gin (£9.65) was rated better than brands like Hendricks and 
Bombay Sapphire, which are twice the price.

For the most part, Aldi sells their own ranges, interspersed with a handful of famous brands such as Haribo and Marmite. They’re also notorious for doing ‘lookalike’ ranges — products cunningly designed to look like well-known brands but at a fraction at the price.

At last I feel ready to head for the chaotic central ‘special buy’ aisles to see if there’s anything I’m missing out on

But as I’m not currently in the market for a two-man tent, a catering-sized jar of pickled eggs or a 35-piece set of spanners, I leave the bargain hunters to it and make my way to the tills.

There are only three checkouts and the shortest queue has 14 people in it. When I finally reach the front, the assistant scans my food so fast his hands are a blur.

He stacks it in a huge tower, and even though it’s apparent I’m struggling to keep up, he doesn’t slow down and several items fall to the floor.

Back home, and with my blood pressure restored to its normal rate, I’m keen to see if the taste of these gold medal winning foods makes up for the hassle of buying them. 

Things don’t start well with the Diplomat teabags, which produce a weak and tasteless cuppa, although the Belmont Jaffa Cakes are indistinguishable from McVitie’s ones, which are double the price. 

The brioche is as delicious as it looks, but I’m disappointed in both the chocolate and the lemon and mascarpone cheesecake that were singled out for praise. To my palate, they taste processed, not homemade.

Just as I am reaching the conclusion that shiny Waitrose is still my true love, I remember the wine and cherries. 

I almost want the cherries to be dry and bitter, but they’re sweet and juicy — and the perfect accompaniment to my large glass of Toro Loco Tempranillo, which must be smoothest wine I’ve ever tasted. How on earth can it have cost just £3.69? 

Suddenly I’m regretting not having snapped up a whole box of the stuff — and a load of that award-winning gin to boot.

Aldi, I have a feeling I’ll be joining the Surrey housewives and weaving my way — perhaps a little unsteadily — down your aisles once more.
