An elderly woman with a half a million-dollar fortune has had her life-savings plundered by her son and daughter-in-law, a court heard.

Ivan Ljunghammar and his wife Deborah Jean were charged with first-degree theft earlier this month after allegedly stealing $512,800 from his 82-year-old mother's bank account.

The couple, from Seattle, were given control of the woman's financial affairs in 2007 after she began suffering from dementia.

Seattle detective Pamela St John, who specializes in cases of elderly abuse, said that other family members became suspicious the couple might be exploiting the 82-year-old. 

The octogenarian, who was described as sprightly but unable to manage her finances, currently lives in a Bellevue care home for those with dementia.

The Ljunghammars withdrew $190,000 from the woman's bank accounts and employed a convicted felon to care for her.

'Ivan asserted complete control over (her) person and finances, 
isolating her from the rest of her family, preventing her from attending
family celebrations or vacations … and using her finances to pay his 
personal and household expenses,' Detective St John told the court, 
according to Seattle PI.

King County Senior Deputy Prosecutor Page Ulrey brought charges against the pair after it was discovered her son had been renting his mother's homes out for less than the market value.

Mr Ljunghammar had also been using her cars and acquired power-of-attorney for his mother.

The Ljunghammars were expected to enter a plea in the next few days. Neither was being held in the county jail.

According to Adult Protective Services in the Seattle area, there were 14,577 
reported cases of elderly abuse and exploitation in the 
state in 2009, the latest available data.

In most cases, the victims are over 60 years old and they were targeted by members of their own family.
