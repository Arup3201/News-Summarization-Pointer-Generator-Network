Amanda Knox's ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito today spoke of his anguish at having to face a retrial over the death of Meredith Kercher, saying: 'I don't know how long I can keep going.'

He defended himself against the accusation that he is profiting from the British student's death, as he says he needs to raise money for his legal fees and is unable to find 'a real job'.

Knox and Sollecito were jailed in 2009 after being found guilty of murdering Miss Kercher, but were freed on appeal in 2011.

However, Italian judges have now ordered them to return to court for a fresh trial, although both deny any involvement in the student's death.

Anguish: Raffaele Sollecito claims he and Amanda Knox are 'victims' of Meredith Kercher's death

Sollecito, 29, said this morning that he and his former lover were 'victims' of the case, claiming they have continuously suffered despite being innocent.

'Meredith was the first victim of this hideous fact, but we are other victims,' he told Daybreak.

'You just have to survive, and this is a kind of survival game... I don't know how long I can keep going.'

He denied trying to make money from Miss Kercher's death with paid interviews and the publication of a memoir, and insisted he had no other way of funding his defence.

'I have to make money to defend myself,' he said. 'I cannot get a real job, and even if I could get a job there's not enough money there.'

Knox, 25, who lives in Seattle, is unlikely to return to Italy to stand trial, but Sollecito has little choice.

'I am Italian and she is American, so it is more difficult for me,' he told Daybreak. 'It's not about facing this nightmare together any more, because we are no longer together as a couple.'

Last week, he told The Sun: 'Meeting Amanda was like being hit by a thunderbolt. Our relationship got very intense, very quickly.

'I didn't have much experience of sex. She had a bit more than me. We were sleeping together and our sex life wasn't boring.

'We talked about fantasies and asked each other what we liked and so on, but it was totally normal.'

Sollecito said he felt great sorrow over the death of Miss Kercher, and added that he would one day like to visit her grave in Mitcham, Surrey.

He said: 'I will never forget Meredith. It was terrible what happened. But I am not responsible for her death.

'It
makes me sad when her family say they still believe other people were 
involved. Rudy Guede is in prison for her murder and his DNA was all 
over the scene.'

He described the reopening of the trial as like a 'horror movie where
they keep making sequels', and continues to deny having anything to do 
with Miss Kercher's death.

The court ruled that the 21-year-old's death may have been the result of a 'sex 
game gone wrong' and have ordered Sollecito and Knox back for trial.

This has resulted in Sollecito launching a desperate $500,000 (£320,000) online appeal for donations to fund his retrial.

The
computer studies graduate said he was hard up and needed the cash for 
'legal expenses' but added he would donate anything raised above the target 'to a research foundation'.

In an appeal posted on his Facebook page, Sollecito wrote: 'Well Guys, the problem for me now is pretty though.

'I'm deeply concerned not just for 
the issue I'm facing and most of you already know about, but also 
because I don't have resources anymore to fight this injustice.

'I
badly need to be able to hire experts, when needed, or pay my attorney 
fees, documents fees, and so on when the new appeal will start.

'I
hope to not bother you, but I need your collaboration to face this 
ordeal. Otherwise I don't want to forced to give up just for financial 
reason. 

'I hope you 
will understand. I'm just asking if you, buddies, know how to build up a
non-profit raising funds foundation. Big Hugs, Raffaele Sollecito.'

Crime scene: This is the flat in Perugia where Meredith Kercher was found dead

Sollecito
is thought to have been paid $1million (£650,000) for U.S. TV news 
interviews and an advance on his book Honour Bound: My Journey to Hell 
and Back with Amanda Knox, which was published last year.

However, a sizeable proportion of that
was swallowed up in legal fees to his team of lawyers including Italy's
high flying Giulia Bongiorno who is said to have the highest fees in 
the country.

Miss
Kercher's body was found in November 2007 in her bedroom of the house 
she shared with Knox in Perugia, a central Italian town popular with 
foreign exchange students.

Knox and Sollecito were 
initially convicted and sentenced to long prison terms, but a Perugia 
appeals court acquitted them in 2011, criticising virtually the entire 
case mounted by prosecutors.

The appellate court noted that the 
murder weapon was never found, said that DNA tests were faulty and that 
prosecutors provided no murder motive.

A
young man from Ivory Coast, Rudy Guede, was convicted of the slaying in
a separate proceeding and is serving a 16-year sentence.
