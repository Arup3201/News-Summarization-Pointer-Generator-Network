Ched Evans has issued a 'wholehearted apology' for the effects of his actions in 2011 but continues to maintain his innocence over his rape conviction. 

Evans saw his proposed move to League One Oldham Athletic collapse on Thursday after intolerable pressure from sponsors and fans even extended to threats to staff. 

One board member told the BBC that a supporter had sickeningly said to them they knew where their daughter worked and that she would be raped should the club follow through with plans to sign him.

And now Evans has issued a statement via the PFA in which he has apologised for the effects his actions had on people. 

Evans has also condemned people using social media to abuse the woman concerned. 

Evans said: 'I am grateful for the support of the PFA in helping me try to return to football and continue my career.

'Upon legal advice, I was told not to discuss the events in question. This silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth.

'I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned.

'Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so.'

Evans' proposed signing for Oldham has collapsed after the uproar that surrounded the negotiations.

It comes just a day after Oldham's joint-owner Simon Corney said there was an '80 per cent' chance of the 26-year-old being signed. 

Evans was released from prison last October, halfway through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman.

Corney had said he believes Evans 'has served his time' and said the decision to give the 26-year-old a chance had been agreed unanimously by all six members of the Oldham board - despite vociferous opposition and sponsors severing ties with the League One club.

It is the second time the club have pulled out of a deal to sign the striker, whose chances of finding a club willing to take him on now appear limited.

Sheffield United also decided against giving him a contract after initially agreeing to let him train with the club.

Jim McMahon, the leader of Oldham council, confirmed the deal is off and said the issue had caused 'intimidation, abuse and harassment'.

McMahon said in a statement: 'I understand Oldham Athletic's move to sign Ched Evans is off.

'I've always believed in rehabilitation but felt that both club and player should have allowed Mr Evans' appeal to run its course before agreeing a contract. As it stands Mr Evans has been found guilty in a court of law and has not yet completed his sentence.

'In recent days we've seen an horrendous "trial by social media" with intimidation, abuse and harassment on a scale that has cast a terrible shadow.'
