Kirsty, 31, decided that she needed to lose weight after her brother announced his engagement

A mother of five who dreaded the thought of attending her brother's wedding because of her size has lost 10 stone ahead of his big day.

Kirsty Armstrong, from Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham, dropped half her body weight slimming from 20 stone and a size 28 to 9st 6lbs and a size 10-12 in time for the big day.

The 31-year-old had struggled with her size for years but finally found the inspiration to shed the pounds when she found out her brother was tying the knot - swapping takeaways and junk food for fresh fruit and vegetables.

Kirsty said her inspiration behind her weight loss was the thought of being overweight in the wedding photos.

She said: 'My brother was getting married in July and I wanted to lose weight for his wedding.

'I never had the confidence but I would try to eat healthy and it wouldn't ever really work.'

Kirsty added that no matter how big her efforts had been in the past, her bad habits had crept into her eating, taking her to 20st 1lb.

'I would just pick off the kids' plates and snack on crisps during the day and then have a takeaway meal for dinner after they went to bed,' she said.

But in January, determined to change her ways, Kirsty joined New Herrington Slimming World group which meets once a week at St Aidens Parish Centre for support.

Kirsty said that the slimming group was more effective than going it alone as there was a sense of unity.

'The slimming group is just a massive support for me,' she said. 

'There's loads of us in there. There's a girl who is 14 up to a man who is in his 70s. It didn't take long to see changes. In the first two weeks I lost 6.5lbs and in the third week 7lb.'

Kirsty may have seen quick results but she said losing weight wasn't easy. Kirsty's routine had a complete overhaul adding exercise to her schedule as well as changing almost everything about her diet in order to shift the weight.

'I eat loads of fresh fruit and vegetables. I don't have takeaways and I cook a lot from scratch. I have proper meals now,' she said.

'I always cooked for my kids but now because I have loads of fruit and veg they snack on that too.

'I also did loads of walking. I started walking my dogs for three or four miles.'

By the time of her brother's wedding, Kirsty had reached her goal having lost 8 stone. However, spurred on by her success she continued to slim and lost an additional 2 stone. 

Kirsty's weight loss was so dramatic that it even saw her shortlisted in the Slimming World's Woman of the Year competition where she got to meet Hollyoaks, Casualty and Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps star Will Mellor.

Kirsty says that the whole experience left her completely star-struck.  

'It was a once in a lifetime experience meeting Will Mellor, absolutely amazing. He was really lovely. He told me I'd done amazing and looked great.'

Aside from the celebrity perks, Kirsty says that her weight loss has also helped to improve her relationship with her children. 

'I can do more with the kids and it's given me more confidence,' Kirsty added. 'I can run around with them which I couldn't do before.'
