Some designers play it safe at Haute Couture Week by favouring muted colour palettes and letting the details speak for themselves.

Mexican designer Antonio Ortega, however, made a statement with his colourful catwalk show in Paris on Wednesday night.

Inspired by graffiti and road signs in his hometown of Montreal, Canada, Ortega's runway was an amalgamation of colour and texture.

He also gave his birthplace of Mexico a nod via his rainbow-hued colour palette. 

'There's colour everywhere,' he said of his native country and source of inspiration.

Models closed the show in bright silk prints  and statement oversized headgear, concluding what was a truly exuberant and playful collection.

Ortega began presenting ready-to-wear in 2008 and admits that his style is 'very colorful'.

He said in a recent interview: 'You see the colour, the shapes, the material, the detail, and you see my identity as an artisan who has touched on the tastes of different cultures. 

'My style says: “I’m here. I have this presence.”'

'I don’t try to impose anything; I like for the client to see their own personality through the clothes. 

'I’m not the type of designer who wants to impose black and white just because I wear black and white all the time.'
