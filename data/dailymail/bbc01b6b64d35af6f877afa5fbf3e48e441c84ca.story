A father-of-three has shed nine stone by smothering his food with chillies and hot sauce in a diet he's described as 'agony'.

Phil Zipser, 35, dropped from 26 stone to 17 stone by cutting down on his massive 4,000-calorie daily feeds and tucking into hot and spicy foods instead.

The Nottingham lorry driver was forced to lose the excess pounds after developing a series of health problems including a heart condition, arthritis, sleep apnea and diabetes, which doctors said were linked to his  crippling obesity.

Father-of-three Phil Zipser, from Nottingham, lost an incredibly nine stone after eating a diet of chillies

Phil says eating the chillies can be agony but it is worth it because he has lost so much weight and improved his health

His big reveal comes in the same week that scientists in the US revealed proof that capsaicin - the active component - found in chillies, boosts calorie-burning.

Yet Phil, who became  convinced of the fat-busting qualities of chillies more than a year ago, was ahead of the curve.

And now he routinely covers all his meals in extreme hot sauce and even snacks on raw chillies and jalapeno peppers to boost his metabolism.

He said: 'I bought the hottest chili sauce I could find - it's made out of ghost peppers which are extremely spicy.

'It's agony eating such hot food - but it has helped me shift the pounds.'

Phil - who lives with his partner of 17 years Helen Capewell, 34, and their three children Shane, 17, Aleisha, 5, and Lucy, one - feared he'd die early if he didn't change his diet.

Lorry driver Phil says he would sit in front of the television eating unhealthy food and consuming large amounts of alcohol

At his heaviest he consumed more than 4,000 calories a day, including four cans of cider and a bottle of wine each night.

'I was drinking cider every night and eating crisps and chocolate all day - it's a killer,' he said.

'I had developed so many health conditions because of my weight. The doctor told me if I didn't do something about my weight, I would die.

'I used to sit in front of the TV and watch films or soaps with a few cans. I never went down the pub as I was too embarrassed to go out as I was so big.

'I have always struggled with my weight - I was even fat when I was a baby. But I was in denial about how much I ate. I thought I was just unlucky.

'I went to the doctors on my birthday in 2013 and they told me my illnesses were getting worse. My wife and kids were with me and I looked at them and knew I had to change.'

Breakfast: Sugary cereal

Lunch: Two pre-packaged sandwiches

Dinner: Pizza

Snacks and drinks: Crisps, chocolate, four cans of cider and a bottle of wine a night 

Breakfast: Spicy Noodles

Lunch:  Spicy Noodles

Dinner: Salmon and new potatoes

Snacks and drinks: Weight Watchers crisps, raw chillies and spicy peppers 

After starting on his diet Phil now has a healthy dinner of salmon and salad 

Desperate to lose weight, Phil discovered that eating spicy chillies could help him lose excess weight. He started on a strict calorie-controlled diet, enlivened with chillies, peppers and hot sauce.

According to new research by the University of Wyoming capsaicin, the chemical which gives chillies their characteristic fiery taste, stimulates a natural process where calories are automatically converted into heat, preventing calories from being stored as fat.

He said: 'When I was at my heaviest, I couldn't even walk upstairs. I was dangerously close to having a heart attack. Losing the weight was tough.

'I covered everything I ate with the ghost pepper sauce. Raw chillies and peppers also helped. They are low in calories, but don't exactly taste very nice. My whole face goes bright red, and I start sweating, so I can feel it working.

'There were times when I wished I was tucking into a spicy curry, but most curries are far too creamy, so not very good for you.'

Phil had put on so much weight that he was suffering from a heart condition and couldn't walk up stairs

Within one year and one month Phil dropped from a size XXXXXL to XL T-shirt size and had shrunk from a 54in waist to a 40in waist.

Before his weight loss he ate sugary cereal for breakfast, two pre-packaged sandwiches for lunch and a pizza for dinner. During the day he would snack on crisps.

Now Phil has spicy noodles for breakfast, the same noodles for lunch and salmon and new potatoes for dinner. For snacks he dips into bags of weight-watchers crisps and munches on raw chillies and spicy peppers.

He said: 'Since I lost the weight my diabetes has stabilised and my sleep apnea has gone. My heart condition should get better as I lose more weight.

'The most important thing now is I can play with my kids. We can go out for a walk in the park at the weekend. We can go out to eat as a family as well. 

'I used to struggle to fit in the chairs in restaurants. I'm still losing weight. I never want to be as big as I was before.'
