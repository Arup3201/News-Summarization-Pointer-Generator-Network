John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John made unlikely teenagers even back in 1978.

But their musical romance as high school sweethearts has made Grease the film we turn to for a pick-me-up.

It topped a poll of more than 2,000 adults who were asked to name their favourite ‘feel-good’ movie.

Grease starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John has been voted the best feel-good film

The research was part of an ongoing 
study by insurers AXA into the little things that mean a lot and while 
Grease was voted overall favourite, there appeared to be a clear divide 
between the sexes.

Women tended to choose musicals, with Dirty Dancing their number one, followed by Grease and Mamma Mia.

Fantasy was the common theme for men, who chose Back To The Future, followed by animated Pixar classics Toy Story and Shrek.

1. Dirty Dancing

2. Grease

3. Pretty Woman

4. Mamma Mia

5. Bridget Jones's Diary

6. Shrek

7. Love Actually

8. The Full Monty

9. Toy Story

10. Sound of Music

Chris Jones of AXA, said the poll showed how a night in with a film was ‘one of those simple experiences that can do wonders in lifting our spirits’.

He said: 'It is clear to see why Grease has taken the top spot as 
the nation's favourite comforting film - it has all the ingredients 
required to lift your spirits.

'At
 AXA, we understand that the little things mean a lot in life and we 
recognise that a night in with a good movie is one of those simple 
experiences that can do wonders in lifting our spirits.'

Modern classics dominate the Top 10, with 70 per cent of them made in the last 20 years.

Surprising
 omissions from the Top 10 include The Sound of Music which, achieved 
just 12th place overall but just scraped into the top ten for women.

It's a Wonderful Life only reached 15th place, while Singin' in the Rain just made it in to the Top 20.

Film
 Juice editor Alex Moss said: 'The top 10 feel-good films all share one 
key component - overcoming the odds and delivering the fairytale ending.

The poll of 2,000 people, undertaken by insurer Axa, found a divide between the sexes. Dirty Dancing starring Patrick Swayze as Johnny Castle and Jennifer Grey as Frances 'Baby' Houseman, was picked as the top film by women

'Whether
 it's a class divide broken, misfits finding their place in the world or
 simply the guy getting the girl of his dreams, these films all tap into
 a sense of wish fulfilment.'

While
 men place sci-fi comedy Back to the Future as their number one 
feel-good film, animated characters also have a special place in their 
hearts.

Two of Pixar's most popular animated pictures feature in men's top five list, with Toy Story in second and Shrek third.

The same rings true for young people, as 18 to 24-year-olds chose Shrek as their top mood-enhancing movie.

1. Back to the Future

2. Toy Story

3. Shrek

4. The Full Monty

5. The Shawshank Redemption

6. Groundhog Day

7. Mamma Mia

8. Pretty Woman

9. It's A Wonderful Life

10. Grease

Hey U Guys film blog founder, Jon 
Lyus, said: 'When the poll results are split by gender it becomes pretty
 clear which is which.

'Men's
 favourite - Back to the Future - has an appropriately timeless message 
at its heart and offers a 'dreams can come true' and 'triumph over 
adversity' story.'

However,
 in contrast, women prefer a musical turn. Dirty Dancing, Grease and 
Mamma Mia all feature in their top five film selection.

When
 women aren't looking for a sing-a-long, they instead turn to powerful 
female heroines, with Pretty Woman and Bridget Jones's Diary coming in 
at third and fifth place respectively.

Simon
 Gallagher, of What Culture film blog, said: 'Interestingly, there 
appears to be a split for women between musical feel-good films, and 
ones with very obviously miserable undertones.

'Perhaps
 there's just more pleasure to be had in seeing a singleton struggle to 
eventually find acceptance just as she is, or a Julia Roberts to find a 
'ruthless' Richard Gere...? After all, tragedy can only make the 
eventual happy ending taste so much sweeter.'

For men, the Back To The Future series, starring Michael J Fox, was the top movie
