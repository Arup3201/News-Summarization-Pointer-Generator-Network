In just two days, it will play host to 198 professional cyclists and millions of spectators.

But now, a German cyclist has warned Yorkshire's roads could be too narrow for the Tour de France.

Marcel Kittel, 26, claimed the winding streets, enclosed by dry stone walls, were 'risky' for riders taking part in the 118-mile first stage of the event.

Warning: Marcel Kittel, of Germany, has warned Yorkshire's roads could be too narrow for the Tour de France

Narrow: The German favourite claimed the winding streets, enclosed by dry stone walls, were 'risky' for competitors. Above, a particularly 'dangerous' part of the course is Buttertubs Pass in the Yorkshire Dales

He said the roads will likely be made even more dangerous as more than four million spectators line the walls, narrowing the path and potentially leading to accidents.

'There will be lots of spectators... where can they go if there are stone walls? I’m curious as to what is going to happen,' the favourite told Cycling News.

'It’s a fact we’ll be using some very narrow roads. I’m sure for riders’ safety it would be better if they were wider.'

Kittel, who made his Tour de France debut in 2012, is one of British cyclist Mark Cavendish's main rivals in the opening stage, with both of them vying to win the green jersey as the fastest sprinter.

Cavendish, from the Isle of Man, has won
 25 Tour stages as the race's most prominent sprinter, but last year, Kittel claimed four wins to the Manxman's two.

Cavendish is said to be particularly desperate 
to win this year's first stage because it ends with a sprint finish in his 
mother's hometown of Harrogate, and would give him the chance to wear the coveted yellow jersey for the first time.

Kittel warned parts of the route from Leeds to Harrogate were 'very dangerous' for the peloton, who will be waved off by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry on Saturday.

One particularly tricky area in Buttertubs Pass, a high road in the Yorkshire Dales that winds north from Sinstone, near Hawes, towards Thwaite and Muker.

Here, cyclists could reach up to 60mph, 
before turning sharply into a narrow stretch of road enclosed by stone 
walls.

'On the descents when you ride through the more lonely roads in the 
middle of nowhere they are very narrow and very small with stone walls 
on both sides, so [when] a very nervous Tour de France peloton fighting for the
 yellow jersey passes by, there can be a very dangerous situation,' said Kittel.

Organisers describe the area as featuring 'winding roads' with a 'challenging climb past 20-metre deep limestone potholes called the Buttertubs'.

He said the winding streets, enclosed by dry stone walls, were 'risky' for riders taking part in the opening stages.

The stretch is also reportedly Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson's favourite road in Yorkshire.

The opening stage of the Tour de France 
begins in Leeds on Saturday, before the second stage commences from York 
to Sheffield Sunday.

The prestigious event, won last year by Britain's Chris Froome, often includes technically challenging routes, including mountain climbs, narrow streets and cobbled surfaces.

Today, a spokesman for Yorkshire's Grand Départ defended the region's roads as testing, but suitable, for the world's best riders.

Finish: Cavendish is said to be desperate to win the first stage because it ends with a sprint finish in his mother's hometown of Harrogate (pictured). The second stage commences from York to Sheffield on July 6

'They have been designed by the race 
organisers to provide a technical challenge as befits the best cycle 
race in the world,' he said.

The third stage of the event, from Cambridge to London, will take place on Monday.

MailOnline has contacted the organisers for comment.
