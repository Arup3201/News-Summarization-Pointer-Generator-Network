It looks like Beats by Dre have been, well, beat. 

The days of NFL football players and coaches sporting the popular headphones during televised interviews are over for now.

This is the result of an exclusive agreement between audio equipment company Bose and the NFL itself. 

Re/code reports that the agreement bans players and coaches from wearing any other headphones during televised interviews and during games.

The ban includes TV interviews conducted during practice sessions, training camps, on game day, and post-game interviews in the locker room or on the podium, Re/code reports.

The ban remains in place for 1 1/2 hours after a game ends. 

An NFL spokesperson stated that the NFL has longstanding policies that 'prohibit branded exposure on-field or during interviews unless authorized by the league.'  

'These policies date back to the early 1990s and continue today,' the spokesperson stated. 'They are the NFL’s policies – not one of the league’s sponsors, Bose in this case. Bose is not involved in the enforcement of our policies. This is true for others on-field.'

Beats, which is now a division of Apple Inc., issued a statement saying that the headphones have become part of the 'pre-game ritual' for athletes, according to Re/code.

A Beats spokesperson said that, over the last few years, athletes have 'written Beats into their DNA.' 

Those days may be over. The famous headphones, created by hip-hop rap legend Dr. Dre, are being attacked from every side.

Re/code reports that even Sony is getting in on trying to beat the Beats.

During the month-long World Cup soccer tournament this summer, the FIFA reportedly informed all 32 competing companies that Beats by Dre were banned on match days and during media briefings. 

The two companies may have reason for their efforts to thwart the headphones exposure. Dr.Dre recently sold Beats by Dre to Apple Inc., for more than $3 billion. Re/code reports that Beats by Dre represents 61 percent of the premium headphone market. 

Bose is lagging behind with 22 percent and Sony accounts for only 2 percent. 

The Daily Dot  reports that neither Bose nor the NFL have announced how much the deal is worth.
