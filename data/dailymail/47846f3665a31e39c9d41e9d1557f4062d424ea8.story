Battered: Michael Pulliam, two, died from multiple broken bones and a brain bleed after being swung into a wall

A babysitter has been charged with murder after he allegedly slammed a toddler he was looking after into a wall.

Jarrod Rudder, 24, grabbed two-year-old Michael Pulliam by the wrist and smacked the child off a wall and lamp causing multiple broken bones and a brain bleed.

Rudder is the boyfriend of the child's mother Amanda Howell and had been living with them at their trailer park home in Elkville, Illinois.

He had been caring for the toddler and his one-year-old brother while Howell was at work.

Paramedics were called to the home on Friday evening in the rural town where they found the boy unconscious.

Michael was taken to hospital in Carbondale before being flown to St Louis Children's Hospital, 90 miles away.

The child later died from his injuries on Sunday evening.

Family members said that they had called social services about Amanda Howell, who has two other children, in the past.

However Howell's sister Stephanie Patrick told WPSD TV: 'He shouldn't have gotten his life cut short and his mother's having a 
hard time dealing with it.

'There's nothing we can do at the end of the day but hope for justice.'

Child services said they were investigating the incident. Howell had previously been questioned three times by authorities.

Only one claim was substantiated and one of her children was taken away in 2008. Her other one-year-old son has now been removed from the home.

Charged: Jarrod Rudder, 24, who was caring for the boy at the time of his death faces a count of first-degree murder in St Louis, Illinois

Rudder, of Elkville, Illinois, was 
charged on Monday and being held at Jackson County Jail after a 
judge set bail at $1 million.

He was appointed an attorney by the 
court after Rudder claimed he could not afford one. However prosecutors said that the 24-year-old had won compensation from a car crash 
several years ago and the judge concluded that if documents could prove 
this, then he would be forced to pay for his own lawyer.

Rudder is next due in court on May 17.

A candlelight vigil for Michael was planned for this evening at 7.30pm in Hurst Park, Illinois.
