As he inched his way along the terrifyingly high wire suspended across the Grand Canyon on Sunday night, Nik Wallenda might have been forgiven for thinking the world would be fixated on his daredevil feat.

But in actual fact, a large part of those watching his stunt were distracted by something else: The 'dad jeans' the Twittersphere said were 'flapping worryingly' around his ankles.

The bootcut jeans, also called 'mom jeans' by amused onlookers, were brought into question by many who wondered whether there was not more suitable technical clothing available to daredevils.

Wardrobe malfunction? Nik Wallenda's flares attracted a flurry of attention from Twitter users concerned the 'flapping' denim might trip him

'Don't understand why Wallenda is wearing a T-shirt and jeans. You'd think there would be special clothing for these daredevils. #SkyWire', said one.

'Not
sure if he needed to go as far as an Evel Kneivel jumpsuit but couldn't
have Wallenda come up with something flashier than old jeans?' another 
wrote.

There they blow! Wallenda's flares sparked concern

One concerned Twitter user added: 'Shouldn't Wallenda be 
wearing skinny jeans - not boot cut? Those flaps could trip him!! 
#skywire"'.

Speculation raged during the walk as 
to which designer was behind the pale blue jeans. But Buffalo have since
come forward to lay claim to the jeans, reporting that the style was in
fact the Buffalo David Bitten Six, currently reduced from $99.99 to 
$69.99.

A spokesman 
for the firm, who on their websiteÂ  describe the tight-fitting jeans as 'roomy', confirmed
to fashionista.com that as a tribute to the stuntman's courageous act -
and no doubt his brave fashion choice - they would be rechristening the
jeans The Nik.

The jeans are, they say, 'stonewashed all the way' and 'perfect' for Sundays: 'Combine a roomy fit with the fading, 
whiskering and casual colour and you've got the perfect pair of Sunday 
jeans'.

Was that the detail that clinched Wallenda's wire walk wardrobe choice this weekend?

Fashionista.com, who said they feared the jeans, which were 'flapping at the cuff with every hint of breeze' were going to trip Wallenda and topple him to his death, reported that according to a release, Wallenda told DJs from WPLJ Radio the jeans were 'perfect'.

'I was wearing Buffalo Jeans which is my favourite brand of jeans,' he said.

'They are very, very comfortable and they are just perfect for walking the wire.'
