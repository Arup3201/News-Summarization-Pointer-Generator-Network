A mysterious new polio-like illness has infected more than 100 children in the U.S. in the last five months, and only one has made a full recovery, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.

The CDC reports that the strange illness is now being called Acute Flaccid Myelitis.

The illness, which has infected 103 children across 34 states, affects the spinal cord, resulting in a sudden onset of weakness in one or more arms or legs.

According to the  The Transverse Myelitis Association, there have been various incidents of partial paralysis, weakness in limbs, and total paralysis among the cases.

Dr. Teri Schreiner from Children’s Hospital Colorado told TMA that many patients have noted facial weakness as well, weakening muscles used to move the eyes, to swallow, and to speak. 

The illness infects children around the age of seven and while about two thirds of the children who have been observed for the illness have shown improvement, one third have shown no improvement.

And, the CDC reports, only one child has fully recovered. Almost all of the children infected were hospitalized, and some were put on breathing machines.

'Unfortunately, none of the treatments that we use commonly for acute myelitis have shown much effect with Acute Flaccid Myelitis,' Schreiner said.

Keith Van Haren, a child neurologist at Stanford University School of Medicine, told The Atlantic that doctors don't know how to treat or prevent the illness.

'It actually looks just like polio, but that term really freaks out the public-health people,' he said.  

Although officials do not know the specific cause of the illness, the CDC reports that the polio-like illness is most similar to illnesses caused by enteroviruses, West Nile virus, herpesvirus, and the adenovirus. 

Recommendations: The CDC is working to pinpoint the cause of the illness, meanwhile, officials recommend frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with sick people, and disinfecting frequently (stock image)

Officials are investigating whether the illness is related to the  2014 outbreak of Enterovirus-D68. The Atlantic reports that neurologists say  the illness may be an effect of the enterovirus outbreak, but the link has yet to be proven.

Additionally, enteroviruses rarely cause myelitis, the CDC reports, they usually cause mild illness or a form of meningitis.
