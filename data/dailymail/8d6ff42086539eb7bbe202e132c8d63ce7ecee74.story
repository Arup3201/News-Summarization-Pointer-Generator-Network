Ordinarily a pancake is a pretty simple creation, consisting of just flour, egg, milk and some butter. But for one father, the humble breakfast snack is a major work or art. 

For the past year, Brek Nebel has created the most amazing artwork each morning on his frying pan. 

Mr Nebel, from Marysville, Washington, said he is inspired by films such as Despicable Me and Frozen. 

Brek Nebel began his pancake odyssey by creating an ingenious design featuring Disney's Mickey Mouse

Mr Nebel began working on his creations 12 months ago to inspire his young son Koen, three

Little Koen, three, even helps his father create the artworks assisting him with the choice of colour or design

The 31-year-old started creating his artworks for his young son Koen, 3, who loves pancakes. 

As well as eating them, Koen helps his father mix the batter and pick the colours to be used.

The pair have been creating their pancake art for a year - making a different character each week.

It began when Mr Nebel carved a Mickey Mouse head from three basic round pancakes.

Mr Nebel said once his son decides on a design or a colour he disappears until it's time to eat

However, Koen Nebel, three, also enjoys using any remaining batter to create his own pancakes

One of Koen Nebel's favourite pancakes is this one featuring a bright red fire engine

But soon blossomed into a weekly trend using cookie cutters, moulds and coloured batter to design the likes of dinosaurs and sharks.

In a bid to expand the boundaries of pancake art, Mr Nebel has even created a design that works with 3D glasses. 

He said: 'Koen enjoys them because he helps with most of the process.

Mr Nebel corresponds with some of his online fans who like to swap tips for making the perfect pancakes

Some of the designs have been made for the benefit of people with three dimensional glasses

The complicated designs feature a range of animals, science fiction creatures and even vehicles

'He pours the ingredients in the bowl, mixes the batter, separates cocoa and colouring and even picks the colours a lot of the time.

'While I'm doing the outline he wanders off, but checks in, and then he's back on the counter to use the leftover batter to put his own pancakes on the griddle. 

'His favourite part is tearing them apart, right before he eats them.' 

Over the past year Mr Nebel has created dozens of different designs which he later photographed

As he gained experience working with pancakes the complexity of his designs increased dramatically 

Mr Nebel, who works as an aircraft technician has a loyal following of fans on the internet
