The nine year-old boy who made it past security and onto a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas may have been on his way to visit someone he met online.

The child made it to at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport by himself, slipped through a security checkpoint and then 
boarded a Delta Air Lines flight before he was discovered by suspicious flight attendants.

When Las Vegas police met the boy upon landing he told them that he had a 'video game buddy' who lived in the city who he was there to visit.

A security video shows the boy at the airport terminal on Wednesday, the day before his trip, officials said.

He
 took a bag from the carousel that did not belong to him and ordered 
lunch at a restaurant outside of the security checkpoints, MAC spokesman
 Patrick Hogan said.

He ate and then told the server he had to use the bathroom, left the bag and never returned to pay.

The owner of the bag was identified 
and the bag was returned to him, Mr Hogan said. At this point, this is a
 Delta and [Transport Security Administration] issue,' he added. 'This 
is a rare incident.'

In a statement to Minneapolis TV station KARE-11, Delta officials said: 'We are investigating the incident and cooperating with the agencies involved.'

KARE-11 reported that authorities believe the nine-year-old boy is a runaway from the Twin Cities.

'He had to pass three levels of security,' said Terry Trippler, an air travel expert with ThePlaneRules.com, to the TV station.

'He had to pass three levels of security. You have the TSA, the gate agents, and the flight crew and a child comes through without even a seat assignment'

'You have the TSA, the gate agents, and the flight crew and a child comes through without even a seat assignment.'

Mr Tippler said that security introduced after 9/11 obviously still has major flaws. 'While we are safer in the air, this proves there are still gaping holes,' he added.

According to a surveillance video, 
at 10.37am, the unaccompanied boy arrived at the airport on a 
southbound light-rail car.

The
 boy was then screened at Terminal 1 and granted access to its nine 
airlines despite appearing to have never produced a required ticket.

The boy is currently in protective custody in Las Vegas after local police filed a missing persons report.

Upon contacting Minneapolis services, they discovered that the boy's parents were not aware that he was missing and had to be told by police.

The boy's parents told Minneapolis Police they 'hadnâ€™t seen much of him today' when officers arrived at the missing child's residence on Thursday after he was reported having run away, according to CBS Minneapolis.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police spokesman Bill Cassell told ABC News the boy was 'more worldly than most nine-year-old kids.'

'He was able to get onto an airline where he didn't have a ticket and made it five states across the U.S.,' Mr Cassell said. 'If it hadn't been for alert airline employees on our end, he probably never would have been discovered.'

According
 to local media, the boy's mother works at the airport and her possible 
involvement in her son's joyride is being investigated.

The Star 
Tribune reports that the child is known to social services  and has been
 the subject of four child protection assessments this year alone.

Only
 last week the boy stole a utility vehicle from downtown Minneapolis and
 made it onto the motorway before he was pulled over.

He also has a history of playing truant and sneaking into a local water park without paying entry.

The boy remains in protective custody in Las Vegas and authorities are working with his parents.
