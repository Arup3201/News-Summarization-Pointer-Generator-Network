Francois Hollande is facing further criticism after tax income from 2013 was little more than half what politicians had forecast

Francois Hollande is facing more criticism tonight after it emerged that France could have a 14billion-euro black hole in its public finances after hugely overestimating tax returns.

Following a week that has seen his position weakened further by the National Front's European election victories, statistics revealed last year's receipts from income tax, VAT and corporation tax were wildly inaccurate.

The President raised the tax when he was elected two years ago, but the surplus from 2013 was only half the 30billion-euros that was forecasted.

The Court of Auditors, which oversees the government's accounts, said the revenue projections in 2013 were wildly inaccurate, overly optimistic and based on inaccurate projections.

Last week French Prime Minister Manuel Valls appeared to criticise Hollande's tax policy by suggesting: 'Too much tax kills tax'.

According to the BBC, opinion polls put Mr Hollande's approval rating below 20 per cent and critics say he is hurting France's economic recovery.

Public spending in France is among the highest in the world and is due to hit 57 per cent of national output this year.

Earlier this month, the IMF warned politicians that high taxes were holding back the recovery after the French economy ground to a halt.

Since Hollande's austerity measures were brought in, unemployment rate has hit a record high of 11 per cent and economic growth has been inconsistent.

In April the number of people without a job grew by a further 14,800, a new record, undermining Hollande's campaign to bring unemployment down.

The Socialist leader has said he would not run for re-election in 2017 if unemployment does not fall by the end of his term.

Official statistics by agency Eurostat also stated that 
output in France stagnated between January and March following just one 
quarter of growth at the end of last year.

Stagnation in the first three months of the year contrasts with growth of 0.8 per cent in both Britain and Germany.

The
 Spanish economy grew by 0.4 per cent but output sank 1.4 per cent in 
the Netherlands, 0.7 per cent in Portugal and 0.1 per cent in Italy.

The income tax threshold for France's wealthiest citizens was raised to 75 per cent last year, prompting some French citizens, including the actor Gerard Depardieu, to leave the country and seek citizenship elsewhere in Europe.

Mr Hollande has already said he will not slow the pace of deficit reduction, adding France 'cannot live with such heavy debt'.

He hiked taxes when he came to power in 2012 having vigorously campaigned against austerity across Europe.
