The IRS wants a bite out of Silicon Valley's free lunches, which the agency says are a fringe benefit and therefore taxable.

Tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are known for their freebies - including lavish free lunch offerings for members of staff.

The IRS has informed tech giants that the free gourmet grub could be subject to a tax of up to 30 per cent of the meal's 'fair market value.'

No lunch tax breaks: The IRS has listed 'employer-provided meals' as a top priority for the next fiscal year

Facebook perks: Employees at tech companies such as Facebook have meals provided to them free of charge which the IRS says should be considered part of their taxable income

According to the Wall Street Journal, the IRS is scrutinizing the tax filings of companies during routine audits and seeking back-taxes on employee meals.

Google reportedly serves 50,000 meals per day in its 120 cafes worldwide. Facebook has several free restaurants at its Menlo Park, California location. Twitter has coffee bars, four different types of kombucha tea and huge cafeterias serving everything from oysters to burgers.

The IRS and the Treasury Department listed 'employer-provided meals' as one of their top priorities for the next fiscal year, an issue on which they are currently 'seeking guidance.'

If free meals are classed as income, employees would be liable to pay tax on it, but it's more likely that the IRS will seek back-taxes from the companies themselves.

Moving forward, companies would have to add the value of the free food each employee consumes when calculating their withholding tax.

However, the argument isn't clear-cut.

Meals are exempt from taxes if the companies can prove they are 'non-compensatory' and a 'convenience to the employer.'

Proving that 'reasonable lunch breaks aren't feasible' is also a legitimate way to claim exemption.

Tech workers are concerned at the possibility of being taxed for their free meals and snacks.

'You start doing that, well then, do you start taxing free coffee as well?' Nathan Grady, a front-end engineer at Weebly, told Fortune. 'It just doesn’t make sense.'

A Wall Street Journal analysis estimates that if a meal's 'fair market value' is between $8 and $10, a Google employee who consumes two meals a day at work could be liable to be taxed on an extra $4,000 to $5,000 per year.

Larger companies like Facebook and Google could offset the tax on the employee by supplementing their annual wage while maintaining the free lunches.

However, smaller tech companies may have to scrap free meals altogether.

Free meals are considered an essential employee perk in Silicon Valley, the provision of which is a major recruitment tool.

The Journal reports that rather than pay the tax or pass it on to their employees big tech companies are likely to fight it out with the IRS in court.
