There are more than 1.7 million words in the Game of Thrones book series, and the average reader takes a staggering 424 days to complete the set.

But if you’re wondering whether it would take you that long, or you're sure you could read it much faster, there is now an online test to find out.

As well as revealing how long it would take for you to read George R. R. Martin’s novels, the results tell you your reading speed, how it compares to the national average, and how long it would take to read 46 other bestsellers.

Take the test below 

The test was created for Tesco’s Blinkbox Books service.

The new boy had kept in the background, in the corner behind the door, almost out of sight. He was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller than any of us. 

His hair was clipped straight across the forehead, like a village choirboy's. He seemed a decent enough fellow, but horribly nervous. 

Although he was not broad across the shoulders, his green cloth jacket, with its black buttons, looked as if it pinched him under the arms and revealed, protruding well beyond the cuffs, a pair of raw, bony wrists, obviously not unaccustomed to exposure. 

His legs, encased in blue stockings, issued from a pair of drab-coloured breeches, very tightly braced. He had on a pair of thick, clumsy shoes, not particularly well cleaned and plentifully fortified with nails. 

It begins by asking users to read a section of text, before clicking Done.

The reader is then asked three questions to determine how much they have remembered and taken in from the portion of text.

As the final part of the test, the reader is asked how long they could commit to reading each day before getting the results.

Based on the speed at which the text was read, and how long the reader could commit to reading each day, a chart reveals how many books they could finish in a year.

For example, following our test, we were told we read 339 words per minute, meaning we could read 56 books a year if we committed to reading 45 minutes a day.

Adding 10 minutes a day increased this total to 68.

Based on the speed at which the text was read, and how long the reader could commit to reading each day, a chart (pictured) reveals how many books they could finish in a year, based on the average length of a bestseller at 99,390 words. The chart also shows how the participant’s reading speed compares to the average reader

The test also calculates the number of words in 47 bestsellers, including Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, War and Peace and Pride and Prejudice, to reveal how long it would take the participant to complete each one

These results were based on the average length of a bestseller at 99,390 words.

The chart also shows how the participant’s reading speed compares to the average reader.

And a slider along the bottom of the graph reveals how the total number of books would change if the amount of time spent reading each day was decreased, or increased.

On the next page, the test calculates the number of words in 47 bestsellers, including Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, War and Peace and Pride and Prejudice, and reveals how long it would take to complete each one.

Based on our test results, it would take us 118 days to read the whole Game of Thrones book series by George R. R. Martin (pictured). This is 306 days faster than the average reader

Based on our test results, it would take us 118 days to read the whole Game of Thrones book series by George R. R. Martin, 71 days to read J.K Rowling’s Harry Potter series and 38 days to read Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace.

In regards the Game of Thrones series, this is 306 days faster than the average reader.

The key to the test isn’t to rush through the text and prove how fast a person can read, it is designed to identify a person’s natural reading pace.
