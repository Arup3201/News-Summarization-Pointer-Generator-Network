Britain could face a return to Seventies-style power rationing to prevent blackouts.

The disturbing news came amid warnings that the country may not be producing enough energy to keep the lights on by 2015.

Offices and factories could be ‘bribed’ to close for up to four hours a day during the winter to prevent households losing power.

Blackout: Britain could face a return to Seventies-stye power rationing, energy regulator Ofgem has warned

Energy regulator Ofgem said the 
country faced an ‘unprecedented challenge’ as coal-fired plants are 
closed by European Union diktats on the environment.

In addition, nuclear power stations, 
which produced 26 per cent of Britain’s electricity when Labour was 
elected in 1997, now account for just 18 per cent.

Ministers say the 
previous government failed to protect our energy supply by commissioning
 replacements for ageing reactors.

Yesterday Danny Alexander, Chief 
Secretary to the Treasury, promised £10billion for a new plant at 
Hinkley Point in Somerset that could power five million homes.

French 
firm EDF had demanded government cash to put towards the £14billion 
reactor.

That funding was revealed as part of a
 £100billion package to build new roads, railways, houses and schools, 
in a bid to create jobs and stimulate the economy.

Ministers also 
announced measures backing two controversial sources, wind farms and 
shale gas.

The plans were announced as Ofgem 
warned that the gap between household demand for energy and the amount 
our power stations can supply is dangerously small.

The regulator warned
 of ‘faster than anticipated tightening of electricity margins towards 
the middle of this decade’.

It forecast that with no major action  to
 head off the crisis, the risk of blackouts would increase from the 
current chance of one in 47 years to as little as one in four.

To prevent an energy crisis, Ofgem yesterday announced new powers for 
National Grid, which could come into effect before the end of this year.

Under the most radical measure, businesses that sign up to a deal with 
National Grid will be told to shut down between 4pm and 8pm on cold 
evenings.

National Grid, which has a budget of up to £800million to help
 control demand, will compensate firms for the energy they do not use at
 well-above the market rate of about £50 per Megawatt hour (MWh).

Rewards would range from £500 to £15,000 per MWh.

Officials claim the 
closures would  not unduly inconvenience factories and firms, as they 
could open on Saturday mornings to catch up on lost work.

Unprecedented challenge: Coal-fired power stations are being closed because of EU diktats

Fears: The gap between the amount of electricity that the nation's power stations can supply and the demand from homes and businesses is getting dangerously low. Houses are pictured in Balham, south London

The new rules unveiled yesterday would also let National Grid resurrect mothballed power plants to boost supply.

Andrew Wright, Ofgem’s chief executive, said: ‘Britain’s energy industry
 is facing an unprecedented challenge to secure supplies... it is 
prudent to consider giving National Grid additional tools now to protect
 consumers as the margin between available supply and demand tightens in
 the mid-decade.’

A Grid spokesman added: ‘We have been working with 
the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and Ofgem to consider
 what measures we can take... We are consulting on these two services 
with the industry.

‘This does not mean that disruption is imminent or likely, but Ofgem,  
DECC and ourselves believe it appropriate to consider what measures 
could be taken in case margins deteriorate further.’

DECC said it supports the plans, but  questioned the figures behind Ofgem’s blackout warnings.
