Donald McNicol, 54, was beaten to death when he refused to give up his seat at the community centre

A gang of youths who savagely beat a father-of-two to death when he refused to give up his seat at a community centre computer have been jailed for a total of 37 years.

Donald McNicol, 54, refused to be intimidated by the four youths who targeted him when he used a computer to look for engineering jobs at the community centre. 

One of the gang started an argument with Mr McNicol and the rest then viciously attacked him in a 'gratuitous and uncontrolled' assault lasting just 45 seconds. 

During the onslaught, Zimbabwean-born Mr McNicol, who was described as 'quiet and good natured', had a chair thrown at him and was repeatedly punched, leaving him crumpled on the floor with blood all over his face. 

He suffered a serious brain injury and died in hospital two weeks later.

Monsur Rahman, 19, his brother Mamunoor Rahman, 18 and Daniel Okello, 20, were found guilty of murder, following a trial at the Old Bailey. And 17-year-old Ibrahim Ford was convicted of manslaughter.

Today, Judge John Bevan ordered the Rahman brothers to be detained for at least 11 years and Okello for a minimum of 10 years and six months. Ford was told to serve five and a half years.

To the three defendants who were convicted of murder, he said: 'I am conscious that this was entirely unpremeditated and there was no intention to kill but it was a gratuitous uncontrolled attack to the head of a defenceless victim.'

He told them he was imposing the shortest sentence possible in the hope that they can eventually turn their lives around an 'do something positive' to repair the damage they had done.

To Okello, whose mother turned him in to police after he confessed to her what he had done, the judge said: 'I feel very sorry for your mother for the appalling bind you have put her in. I only hope you feel the same.'

Mr McNicol's family were tearful as they saw his killers being sent down from the dock.

The brutal attack took place on December 2 last year at Stockwell Park Community Centre in south-west London. 

Opening the case, prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC had said: 'Monsur Rahman told Donald McNicol to get off the computer terminal as he wanted to use it himself.

'Mr McNicol was not to be so easily dislodged and he refused - telling Monsur Rahman that he would have to wait his turn. Monsur Rahman was not, however, going to give way peacefully and the exchange became more heated.

'He persistently demanded they go outside to sort it out.'

Monsur Rahman then rolled his chair in to Mr McNicol before squaring up to him.

'Within seconds the rest of the group joined in and attacked Mr McNicol, punching him to the head,' Miss Whitehouse said. 'He turned against the wall to protect his face but the blows kept coming. It was a vicious onslaught and out of all proportion to any threat that as posed by Mr McNicol.

'Finally, one of the group, Mamunoor Rahman, picked up a chair and brought it crashing down on Mr McNicol's head, and then continued to punch Mr McNicol.

'The whole incident had taken about 45 seconds, perhaps a minute. It was very, very quick.'

All the defendants had denied murder but Mamunoor Rahman pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of manslaughter having admitted assaulting Mr McNicol with a chair.

Meanwhile, Okello admitted landing a single punch and the others denied having anything at all to do with the fatal attack. 

After the convictions, Scotland Yard's Detective Chief Inspector Tim Duffield said: 'Mr McNicol was sitting quietly at a desk when this group singled him out and launched a most vicious and cowardly attack. Their actions were completely inexcusable.' 

The Stockwell Park Community Centre was a pioneering project formed in 1994 in response to a high crime rate, a demoralised and demotivated community and poor housing management.

Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair visited the centre on the campaign trail in 1997 and a year later it became one of the first charities in London to offer free internet access.
