We've all been there: the annoying moment when your iPhone goes off and you're busy doing something else.

You stop what you're doing, reach into your pocket or bag, and by the time you've pulled out the phone, you're too late to draw your finger across the screen and answer the dratted thing.

Well, if you thought YOU were annoyed by missed calls, you obviously weren't as annoyed as this Japanese man.

No more missed calls: The Japanese inventor demonstrates how his gadget works

As this hilarious footage (see below) shows, he has devoted serious thought to the first world problem of missed iPhone calls.

Obviously inspired by the quick-draw technique of gunslinging cowboys in Western movies, the young man has designed a holster for the iPhone that can, apparently, be strapped to the limb of your choice.

The YouTube clip shows a detailed drawing of the holster, which seems to be an iPhone holder attached to an extending plastic arm that you strap to your arm or leg.

When the phone rings, you flick your wrist and the arm shoots out, bringing your phone to your ear in a second.

When the phone is not in use, it remains hidden up your sleeve.

On the clip, the man demonstrates in agonising detail how the quick draw holster works.

Shoots from the sleeve: The iPhone is always close to hand

In a variety of increasingly bizarre locations (sitting on a loo, leaping backwards onto his bed, lying beside a toy train track on a building's roof), the inventor shows how the iPhone can be at his ear almost immediately it rings.

He looks extremely pleased with himself as he stares into the camera.

His invention does not always work perfectly, though, with the iPhone flying out of its holder and across the room on a couple of occasions.

You can wear it on your leg...

Or on both legs, should the mood take you

Why he felt the need to test his gadget on top of a tall building while lying next to a train-set is anyone's guess, but it hasn't harmed the ratings, which were pushing 1,000,000 this morning, two days after the clip was posted on YouTube.

Most of the comments posted by viewers were positive, but not everyone was so impressed.
