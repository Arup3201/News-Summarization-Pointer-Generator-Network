'Wordsworth would be having fits': Andrew Motion

William Wordsworth would be ‘having fits’ about the development planned for the countryside, former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion has said.

Now president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, he made the claim as he criticised the  Government’s ‘philistine’ relaxation of planning laws in favour of builders.

He said: ‘It is pretty clear that Wordsworth would be having a series of fits about what is going on now and the great tragedy of it is that a lot of this stuff doesn’t need to happen.

‘There are a million-and-a-half brownfield sites available – build on them. The Government should be incentivising builders to build on them which provides the kind of housing that we need.

‘It regenerates often rather decayed landscapes, it means we don’t have to create new infrastructure. It is plain good sense.

‘We need to be extraordinarily vigilant about this because when it is gone, it is gone forever.’

Wordsworth immortalised the Lake District with his 1807 poem Daffodils.

Sir Andrew also referred to Philip Larkin’s 1972 poem Going, Going in which he wrote of his concern ‘that will be England gone’ because of shoddy development.

The former Poet Laureate blamed the National Planning Policy Framework of 2012, which aimed to cut red tape, saying it was the work of ‘philistine’ Whitehall officials.

Sir Andrew told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I feel in my lifetime there is a greater risk to our countryside because of these careless loosenings of things which need to be very properly defended.

‘It is philistine but worse because it is so unnecessary. It is a betrayal of the heritage, it is the pursuit of money and development.’

He also criticised councils for approving ugly ‘boxlike’ homes.
