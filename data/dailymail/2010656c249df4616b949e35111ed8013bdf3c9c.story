A future Tory government ‘will deliver’ English votes for English laws, Mr Cameron declared yesterday as he made a ‘vow’ on home rule.

The Prime Minister said Scotland would get more devolved powers – as promised by the major party leaders in the late stages of last month’s referendum campaign.

But he would also fix the current unfairness in the constitution for people in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, he said.

‘During that referendum campaign we made a vow to the Scottish people that they will get more powers – and we will keep that vow,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘But here’s my vow to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. I know the system is unfair.

‘I know that you are asking: if Scotland can vote separately on things like tax, spending and welfare, why can’t England, Wales and Northern Ireland do the same? I know you want this answered. So this is my vow: English votes for English laws – the Conservatives will deliver it.

Cabinet minister William Hague will chair a committee to draw up proposals for English home rule.

Tory backbenchers want Scottish MPs to be excluded from votes on English-only issues.

But Labour has refused to support the move – which could undermine its efforts to secure a majority in the House of Commons.

The party currently has some 40 MPs in Scotland, all of whom have as much influence on English legislation as MPs from English seats.

By contrast, Scottish issues such as health, education and criminal justice are decided by members of the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood.
