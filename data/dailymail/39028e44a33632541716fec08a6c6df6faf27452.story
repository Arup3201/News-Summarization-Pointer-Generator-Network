A bemused vicar was forced to turn into an amateur sleuth after she rang police to report a theft of lead from her church - and was told to preserve the thieves' footprints in the snow herself.

Reverent Heather Murray discovered the wrought iron gates and lead from the porch of St Thomas' Church in Harelaw, Annfield Plain, near Stanley, County Durham, had been prised off.

She found a trail of footprints in the snow and rang police, thinking they may help police to catch the thief.

Do it yourself: Bemused Reverent Heather Murray, pictured holding part of the broken porch, was told by police to try and preserve thieves footprints in the snow herself when she reported a theft from St Thomas' Church near Stanley, County Durham

But when she called Durham Constabulary she was told officers were unable to attend until later and asked her to preserve the crime scene by herself.

Rev Murray said: 'I noticed the footprints in the snow so I followed them and found the lead had been stolen and the metal gates - they are about 4ft high and very heavy.

Evidence: The vicar had to point out to police officers that she couldn't preserve the footprints as the snow was already melting

'The footprints I found were from an adult with big feet.

'I rang police to report it and they asked if I would be to cover the set of footprints and preserve them until the police came out to see me later.

'I said it would not be possible because the snow was melting and also I had a funeral later that day and they might be trampled on.

'The only appointments available were 2pm or 4pm but the earlier one was not convenient, so they were not able to use the footprints.

'I found the phone call quite humorous.'

It is the third time St Thomas', a grade II listed building, built in 1840, has been targeted by lead thieves, who have already caused £5,500 worth of damage, this year.

Rev Murray said: 'To think of stealing from a church is about as low as you can go.'

A Durham Police spokesman said: 'If someone is reporting a crime and there is possible evidence, it would be standard procedure to ask the caller if they could preserve this in any way.

'In this particular case the rain on Monday morning was starting to turn the snow to slush, so it would have been very difficult for a crime scene examiner to take any worthwhile prints even if they had been able to attend within a few hours.'

Following procedure: A spokesman for Durham Constabulary said the advice given to Rev Murray was standard procedure if officers could not attend the scene immediately
