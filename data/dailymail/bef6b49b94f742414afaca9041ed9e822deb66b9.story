Despite trying to pass their burgeoning romance as off as 'a bit of fun', it seems Florence Brudenell-Bruce has quickly succumbed to Prince Harry's irresistible charm.

The 25-year-old model reportedly told friends the relationship is getting serious and that she 'might be in love.'

But despite having her head in the clouds, the lingerie model's feet appear firmly on the ground.

Florence was pictured around London today, riding the bus and hiring a 'Barclays Bike'.

There was no sign of Harry though as Florence, rode the bus on her own.

The pair, who have known each other for 
over six years, have been dating for several weeks after the young Royal
allegedly chatted her up, making flirty references to polo practice.

Prince Harry reportedly asked Flee if she 'fancied a spot of stick and balling?' to which Flee replied 'well I do love redheads.'

She then impressed the Apache pilot with her party trick - drinking a shot while doing the splits.

The couple, who have friends in common, are said to have just started dating and the Prince often spends time in her Notting Hill home in West London.

A friend told The Sun:'Flee's already said she loves being Harry's girl and has fallen for him fast.

'She's a party girl and Harry loves her wild side.'

Harry,
26, who is due to return to Afghanistan next year, recently split with 
on-off girlfriend Chelsy Davy and maintained he was '100 per cent 
single.'

And it looks as though Florence is also attempting to keep the relationship under wraps. When asked to comment, she said: ‘There’s not much to 
say.’

The aspiring actress, who has appeared in numerous campaigns, a Bollywood film and even played a corpse on ITV series Lewis.

Meanwhile,
ex Chelsy was out on the town last night with a friend. Chelsy was all 
smiles, attending a private view at Scream Gallery in Mayfair.

The blonde, dressed in ripped jeans, looked eerily similar to Florence as it seems Harry certainly has a type.

Florence, like Chelsy, also enjoys a partying lifestyle and holidays in Ibiza, where she is reportedly trying to convince Harry to spend time.

The lingerie model, a
descendant of the seventh Earl of Cardigan who led the Charge of the 
Light Brigade, previously dated Formula 1 racing driver Jenson Button for two years.

She has a history of art degree from Bristol University and has modelled for big brands including John Lewis and Adidas.

As well as Button, Florence has been linked to stars including society favourite Henry St George and Iain Russell.
