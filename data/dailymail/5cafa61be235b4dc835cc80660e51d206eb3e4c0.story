Survivors of the Sandy Hook massacre are to pay tribute to 26 classmates and teachers who were gunned down last month by singing America the Beautiful at the Super Bowl on Sunday.

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed that 26 pupils from the Newtown, Connecticut elementary school will perform in the pregame show of Super Bowl XLVII just before Alicia Keys performs the national anthem.

The NFL will fly the students and their families down to New Orleans ahead of the performance which will cap a season in which the league lent its support to the devastated community.

Since the December masssacre, NFL players have worn the school's initials on their helmets, taken part in moments of silence before games while some have paid personal tribute with messages on cleats and gloves or made charitable donations.

The New York Giants also welcomed students and families onto the field during their pregame introductions before their victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.

That tribute came shortly after Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz paid an emotional visit to the family of 6-year-old Jack Pinto, a Cruz fan who was buried in a number 80 Giants shirt.

He said after the visit: 'It was a time where I just wanted to be a positive voice, a positive light in a time where it can be very negative. It was a good time.

'They're a great family and they are really united right now at this time. It was good to see.'

Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson auctioned off his game-worn cleats on which he had written all of the victims' names.

He gave the proceeds to the United Way's Sandy Hook School Support Fund.

And the Houston Texans raised money for the victims.

Defensive end J.J. Watt tweeted a picture of him and a handful of students on the field the Friday before Houston's game against the Indianapolis Colts.

Watt told USA Today: 'I just kind of wanted to give them as normal a day as possible, just running around, having fun, going out on the field.

'We were kicking field goals. They were trying to put it through the uprights. Just be kids.

'And to see them in a normal setting, having fun and big smiles on their faces was awesome.'

A group of students recently recorded a version of Over the Rainbow with pop singer Ingrid Michaelson at the home of Connecticut residents Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, with the proceeds going to Newtown Youth Academy and the United Way of Western Connecticut.
