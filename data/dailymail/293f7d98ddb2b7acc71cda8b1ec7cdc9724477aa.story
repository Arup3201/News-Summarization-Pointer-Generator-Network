With each passing day at West Bromwich Albion, James Morrison is witnessing the continuing revival of a natural-born leader. 

The end product will benefit Scotland’s ambitions every bit as much as those harboured at the Hawthorns.

Morrison was thrilled when Darren Fletcher chose the Baggies as the club at which to continue his career following 342 appearances for Manchester United.

All those phone calls to his international colleague – badgering him to make the move – were not in vain.

The recent years of Fletcher’s career have, of course, been scarred by the chronic bowel condition that so drained his health before surgery provided the right path back to top-level football.

To then leave United, whom he joined as a schoolboy and won five Premier League titles with, must have been an emotional wrench.

But the exit has opened the way to regain the kind of regular action that will delight national boss Gordon Strachan as he ponders the remainder of the Euro 2016 qualification campaign.

Fletcher was promptly made captain of his new club side by manager Tony Pulis and is undefeated in three appearances to date. His positive influence is being felt every bit as much in the dressing-room as it is in central midfield.

The 31-year-old was an excellent servant to United, making 342 appearances in all competitions

‘Some people are born captains, really,’ insisted Morrison. ‘We have a good bunch of lads at West Brom, so that respect was there.

‘It was up to the manager to change the captaincy and Darren has been great since he arrived. He has settled in fantastically well. He has already been getting the lads together so he has done a good job so far.

‘He hasn’t really changed things. He has just been himself. He leads the lads out, shouts orders and gets us up for games. 

'When he has settled a bit more, then I’m sure he will further stamp his authority in terms of what he wants at the club. He leads by example and does everything right.

‘On the pitch, he brings so much experience and energy. Obviously, the players we have in the West Brom midfield are all experienced but I think Darren’s presence rubs off on the other lads. It gets us playing well.

‘Can he get back to his best? I think he can. I know what type of character he is so I have no doubts about that. Just give him a few more games under his belt and he’ll be back to his best.

‘The more games Darren plays, the more his level will rise, as will his fitness and confidence. A fit Darren is a really good player.’

Fletcher, in action for his country in a Euro 2016 qualifying match in September, only recently turned 31

Fletcher only turned 31 earlier this month, so his free-transfer acquisition might well prove one of the biggest bargains to be found in the cash-crazed English top-flight.

‘Darren was at one of the best clubs in the world so it was a big coup for West Brom to get him,’ admitted Morrison.

‘It shows Darren just wanted to play football, although there were family reasons as well and stuff like that.

‘I’ve known him for a long time and I know what he’s all about. When I heard there was a chance of him coming, I was on the phone to him, trying to get him here. I want to play with good players and Darren is certainly that.

‘How did I sell the club? I had my ways! I just said it was a real family club with great support. Basically it was all about the lads here and I knew he would fit in right away and he has. 

'He’s enjoying it, he told me that himself. I knew he would like the manager and he’s played a big part in it for Darren, too. Tony has done a great job so far.’

The same could be said for Strachan as Scotland prepare to resume their bid to reach France with a Hampden qualifier against group minnows Gibraltar late next month.

Morrison knows the task of taking on a side routed by Poland and the Republic of Ireland will be all about mentality.

After all, Scotland don’t exactly have a great history against teams they are supposed to wipe the floor with.

‘We’ll prepare for Gibraltar in the same way we have for every game,’ insisted Morrison, who was speaking on behalf of Scotland team sponsor Vauxhall. 

‘You can’t slack off in football because that’s when it bites you on the backside. You’ve got to be professional. With Gordon, we’ve been really switched on and professional

‘I remember I played against Nuneaton in the FA Cup with Middlesbrough and that was a 1-1 draw. I think that’s the only really big upset that I’ve played in. 

'That was a typical FA Cup game, a really good occasion and we did the job in the replay the following week. Hopefully we do our job against Gibraltar.

‘You just have to ride the occasion and beat what’s in front of you. With the players in our team I don’t think [a shock] will happen. We’re all looking forward to the game.

‘For me it would be a dream come true to play in a major tournament. The biggest thing, though, is getting there. We’ve had a great start but that’s all it is. We’ve got a long way to go. But I sense everyone is together and pulling in the right direction. That’s important.’
