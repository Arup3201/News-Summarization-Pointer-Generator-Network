Sydney siege hostage Marcia Mikhael has lashed out at the country's bail system for allowing gunman Man Haron Monis to roam free, despite being on charges of accessory to the murder of his ex-wife.

Speaking to 7News, Ms Mikhael said was 'upset' and 'disappointed' with the judicial system for failing to imprison Monis, who was also on a further 40 charges of sexual assault. Monis went on to cause the death of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson on December 16 during the Lindt Cafe siege.

'How was he out on bail? If he wasn't on bail none of this would've happened,' Mikhael told Seven.

Marcia Mikael (pictured) has bravely opened up about the moment she 'gave up home' and begged with her captor, Man Monis, to hear 

'How could he be on bail? How can someone so dangerous like him be allowed to be on bail?'

43-year-old Mikhael is the first of the 18 hostages to speak out regarding Monis' criminal record. 

Her comments come after police revealed today that they wrote a 'strongly-worded' submission urging prosecutors to review Man Haron Monis's release on bail over the alleged murder of his ex-wife but the document was never filed.

The Director of Public Prosecutions never received the document, an error expected to be examined at the inquest into the Sydney Lindt Cafe siege which began on Thursday, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Gunman Man Monis was released on bail on December 12 2013. On December 15 2014 he walked into the Lindt Cafe at Martin Place and took 18 people hostage

A source told the newspaper homicide detectives were 'furious' that the documents were given to an officer who never sent them on.

'They pushed up hard to have his bail refused and they sent up a letter to the executive offices to have it reviewed by the DPP but it never got there,' they said.

The inquest will investigate why gunman Monis was out on bail when he took 18 people hostage at the busy cafe in Martin Place on December 15.

Monis was on bail on a charge of colluding with his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, to murder his former wife Noleen Hayson Pal.

On December 12 2013, Monis, 49, and Droudis, 34, who is charged with Ms Pal's murder, applied for bail on the accessory to murder and murder charges.

They were both released on bail reportedly because the prosecution case against them for the death of was considered 'weak'.

She was desperate to tell her children that she loved them, believing Monis would soon shoot her dead

John O'Brien, the oldest hostage at 82, was also one of the first to escape. He says took a risk because 'I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out' 

This is despite the fact that Monis had prior convictions - for writing malicious letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died in Afghanistan - and the outstanding charges over allegations of indecent and sexual assault relating to his career as 'a spiritual healer'. 

Monis then walked in to the Lindt Cafe at Martin Place in Sydney on December 15 and took 18 people hostage.   

In an upcoming interview with Channel Seven, Ms Mikhael, opened up about the devastating moment 'that she gave up hope' while being kept hostage by Man Haron Monis at the Lindt Café in Martin Place - certain that all 17 captives would be shot dead.

Monis, a self-made sheik, made terrifying, calculated threats which made Ms Mikhael certain that she would not leave the building alive. 

'He told us, 'For every person that escapes, I will shoot two'. That was when I lost hope,' Mikhael recounted tearfully.

'That's when I asked him if I could call my kids and if I could speak to them.'

'I actually wanted to hear their voices for the last time.'

Selina Win Pe was among the hostages forced to stand up against the Lindt Chocolate Cafe windows and hold up a flag by the gunman during the 17-hour ordeal 

One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000

'You have 15 minutes'. They are the chilling final words from crazed gunman Man Haron Monis to his hostages, said Selina Win Pe

Ms Mikhael is a 43-year-old mother of three from Glenwood in Sydney's northwest.

She was desperate to tell her children that she loved them, believing Monis would soon shoot her dead.

'I told them that I loved them very much and I needed them to remember that,' Mikhael said.

'My eldest son kept telling me 'Mum, stop it, everything's going to be okay' and I kept telling him 'I know, I know but just remember that I love you, I love you so much' and then I had to hang up.' 

Hostage John O'Brien, 82, has also describes how it felt when on that fateful Monday when the staff and customers at the Lindt Cafe realised that a regular morning at a coffee shop had become a horrifying hostage situation.

'All hell broke loose once he locked the front door,' Mr O'Brien told Seven News.

'He said 'I'll kill you all one by one'. 

Mr O'Brien was one of a group of three people who managed to escape at 3.37pm when the former tennis player noticed a green button which opened the doors, allowing them to flee.

'I said please don't shoot me, please don't shoot me. I only have my mum, please don't shoot me,' she said, unable to hold back tears

Several of the hostages were forced to record video messages, including Selina Win Pe, who has told her story to Liz Hayes for the upcoming 60 Minutes siege special

The eldest hostage knew that if the plan didn't work he would surely be killed by the gunman.

'I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out so…' Mr O'Brien's voice falters as he tries to explain his horrific conundrum.    

Hostage Selina Win Pe also revealed the horrifying moment crazed gunman Man Haron Monis told her she had just 15 minutes to live.

Monis turned to Ms Win Pe during the height of the siege in the Lindt Cafe at Martin Place, where he took 18 people hostage on December 15, and forced her to beg for her life. 

'I said please don't shoot me, please don't shoot me,' she told 60 Minutes in an upcoming special to air on Channel Nine.

'I only have my mum, please don't shoot me. He looked me straight in the eyes and said 'you have 15 minutes''.  

60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon'.

The network told Daily Mail Australia: 'The siege story will (also) include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.'

'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story.'

Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million.

'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story.'

It's also understood that Julie Taylor, 35, the barrister at Eight Selborne Chambers who was 19 weeks pregnant when she was caught up in the stand-off, could also be featured in the 60 Minutes special.

Ceremonies for Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson came more than a week after the deadly siege

The Nine Network confirmed that 'Liz Hayes will be reporting on the Sydney siege special, due to air in the next couple of weeks. 'Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story'. Selina Win Pe revealed to her that hostages were told they had '15 minutes' to live

The shootout. The 60 Minutes special will also focus on those last moments when police stormed the building and gunman Man Monis was killed

She was the hostage protected by her close friend Katrina Dawson, who died after she was hit by a bullet at the conclusion of the siege, and the one according to media analysts who has the most interesting story to tell.

Siege victim Marcia Mikhael, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, is believed to have secured a deal of between $350,000 and $400,000 to tell her story to the Seven Network, as the commercial rivals opened up their cheque books to secure survivors for their respective upcoming specials. 

It's understood Channel Nine put in an offer of up to $300,000 for Marcia Mikhael to tell her horror story from inside the Lindt cafe on December 15th. However, Ms Mikhael, 43, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, opted to go with Seven after they submitted an even bigger offer, Daily Mail Australia understands.
