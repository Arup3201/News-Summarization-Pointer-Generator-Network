President Obama got angry during the Saturday Night Live cold open this week, and it seems that when President Obama gets angry he turns into someone very different - The Rock Obama. 

President Obama (Jay Pharoah) sat down to have a talk with John Boehner (Taran Killam), Tom Cotton (Kyle Mooney) and Ted Cruz (Bobby Moynihan) to talk about how he believed the three men had  undermined his authority.

And when they mocked him over and over again, he attacked the men.

The Saturday Night Live cold open this week had President Obama (above) speaking with John Boehner, Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz

He criticized Speaker Boehner (above) for inviting the Prime Minister of Israel to speak to Congress without consulting him

He criticized Senator Cotton (above) for his leader to Iranian leaders

He also attacked Senator Cruz (above) for praising Netanyahu

'Now, the reason I asked you all here is because we only have until the end of March to get something done,' President Obama tells the three men.

'And that's hard to do when you, Senator Cotton, are sending letters to the Iranian government behind my back.'

This in reference to the Arkansas Republican signing an open letter saying that any deal with Iran could be overturned when President Obama leaves office in 2017.

Obama then turned to Boehner and said; 'Or when you, Speaker Boehner, invite the Prime Minister of Israel to speak to Congress without consulting me.'

Here he is referring to Boehner having Benjamin Netanyahu speak earlier this month.

He continued with Cruz, saying; 'Or when you, Senator Cruz, call Netanyahu an extraordinary leader and side with him over your own president.'

Obama gets further frustrated as the men show no desire to apologize for their actions, with Boehner even telling him; 'I wanted to meet a world leader whose people actually like him.'

Cruz jumped on, saying; 'I'm surprised he even came to visit considering how much you botched the situation in the Middle East.'

Finally, Cotton tells Obama that he believes he knows more than Obama about foreign policy - this after just three months in office.

At this moment Michelle Obama (Sasheer Zamata) walks in and warns the men that they better get ready as her husband is getting angry, and turning into The Rock Obama (Dwayne Johnson).

It is then that he throws Boehner out a window, rips of Cotton's hand and begins to crush Cruz's head, though he is stopped by the First Lady.

At that moment, the Secret Service comes in to say that they have been allowing a vagrant to live in the White House garden the past few months, and Michelle turns into She Rock Obama (Leslie Jones) and rips off the man's arm.
