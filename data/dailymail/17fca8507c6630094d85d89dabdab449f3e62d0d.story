With his team leading the way in the Barclays Premier League, Roman Abramovich can afford to take his eye off the ball for at least a moment.

In fact the Chelsea owner has taken a break away from watching the Blues altogether as he steered clear of the festive fixture pile up to take a break on the Caribbean island of St Barths.

Abramovich was with his girlfriend Daria Zhukova, with the couple also bringing a pet dog with them on their break during the festive period.

While Abramovich was topping up a winter tan, his Chelsea team were busy preparing for their final Barclays Premier League match before Christmas as they looked to open up a three point gap at the top of the table.

The Blues travelled to Stoke and the Britannia Stadium, aware that their last game at the Potters resulted in a last-gasp 3-2 defeat at the hands of Mark Hughes' side 12 months ago.

Chelsea captain John Terry believes it could be one of the Blues' toughest tests of the season so far.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'They probably don't come any tougher than Stoke away. But we are doing well and it's important we go into games doing the dogged stuff, putting our bodies on the line.

'The strength in depth of the squad (is the difference'). This season we are winning games that maybe we drew last season.

'We speak among ourselves about regrouping and going again.'
