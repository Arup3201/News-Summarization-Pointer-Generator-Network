If England are going to exceed expectations and challenge for the World Cup they will need Jimmy Anderson to stay fit and firing as he did in the demolition of India.

Steven Finn grabbed the plaudits in the nine-wicket victory at the Gabba, but Anderson set the tone for what came close to the perfect team bowling performance. 

He was not fit enough to return against Australia in Sydney after missing the one-day tour to Sri Lanka with a knee problem but was at his best in Brisbane, taking four for 18 as India were skittled for 153. ‘I felt good and the wickets were a bonus,’ said Anderson.

‘I’ve been bowling well since I went to South Africa before Christmas — it’s just been trying to get my fitness right.’

Finn also shone, taking five wickets a year on from being sent home from Australia, and Anderson can relate to what he has gone through. ‘I’ve spoken to him here and I was texting him when he was in Sri Lanka,’ he said. 

‘There’s lots of similarities between his path and mine so I try to help him. He deserved to put in a performance after all the work he’s put in and his return is huge because he bowls wicket-taking balls.’

England have now gone south to Tasmania to take on Australia at the Bellerive Oval on Thursday. Mitchell Johnson, David Warner, George Bailey and Michael Clarke are missing and England know a win will take them into the tri-series final.

Steven Finn took all the plaudits, however, as he took five wickets

The suspicion remains that their attack lacks the variety to go all the way in the World Cup, but Anderson insisted: ‘We’re all very different bowlers. We may not be blessed with a left-armer but we’ve got a good enough attack to bowl teams out.’

Warner’s absence is, Australia insist, down to a sore hamstring rather than any disciplinary measure, though players’ behaviour has been in focus after his clash with India’s Rohit Sharma. Yet Anderson is adamant that the sport does not have an attitude problem. ‘I don’t think there are more verbals than at any time in the history of cricket,’ he said.

‘There is just more of a spotlight on it with stump mics and more cameras. It has happened for more than a hundred years so it isn’t just going to disappear.’
