Barbie's iconic Malibu Dreamhouse has undergone many make-overs since it was first released in 1962, gradually becoming bigger, more ornate and notably pinker.

The 2013 incarnation, which hit stores yesterday, boasts three floors, six bedrooms, a balcony and two elevators - one of which connects the bathroom with Barbie's walk-in closet for 'quick outfit changes,' a Mattel spokesperson told Curbed.

This year's elaborate $159 Dreamhouse is certainly a far cry from the original 1962 version - a modest home made of cardboard, which cost just $8.

Modern home: The 2013 Barbie Dreamhouse boasts three floors, six bedrooms, a balcony and two elevators - one which connects the bathroom with Barbie's walk-in closet for 'quick outfit changes'

Fancy toy: The very pink mansion hit stores yesterday, and costs $159

Inside the latest mansion, which has one more bedroom than the 2012 version, Barbie's lavish lifestyle is revealed.

The living room is decked out with a flat screen TV, a purple fireplace, an electric guitar in the corner and a balcony.

A bowl of popcorn sits on the plush sofa, and an imitation fire burns in the fireplace.

Adjacent to the living room is the doll's walk-in wardrobe, which is filled with racks of clothes and numerous pairs of shoes.

At home: In the kitchen, a peek inside the oven reveals a chicken roasting above a batch of chocolate chip cookies, while the refrigerator seems to contain mostly condiments

Interiors: The dining room is fitted with a table for two, with a red chandelier hanging from the ceiling and white teacups lining the shelves

Change of plans: In February this year, Barbie put her Malibu mansion on the market for $25million, but it appears she decided to renovate her home of 41 years instead

Barbie's
bedroom is fittingly girly: a huge pink canopy bed takes up most of the
space, and the room leads onto yet another balcony.

And in case she wants to invite a friend for a sleeper, a trundle bed can be pulled out from underneath her own.

Directly below the closet is the 
bathroom, which comes complete with a light-up mirror, a flushing toilet and a shower that makes the sounds of someone singing.

Drab to fab: This year's Dreamhouse is a far cry from the original 1962 version (pictured), a modest home made of cardboard, which cost just $8.00

Vintage: In 1962 the house, which was designed like a suitcase, the inside walls were bright yellow and the colors were considerably more gender neutral

Downstairs,
on the ground floor, the colorful kitchen is decked out with purple 
appliances, a pink stove top and a blue tiled floor.

A
peek inside the oven reveals a whole chicken baking above a 
batch of chocolate chip cookies, while the refrigerator seems to contain
mostly condiments.

And the
dining room is fitted with a table for two, with a red chandelier 
hanging from the ceiling and white teacups lining the shelves.

Remodeled: In 1973, Barbie's home took on a drastically different style, with a pointed roof with orange shingles and huge windows looking into the yellow interior

Made of plastic, it's fantastic: Instead of cardboard, this Dreamhouse was made of plastic and boasted two storeys, unlike the more modest bungalow of the Sixties

In
February this year, Mattel kicked off a fictional promotional campaign 
to find Barbie's next Dreamhouse, which saw the doll putting her Malibu 
mansion on the market for $25million.

Blurring
the line between fantasy and reality, the house was listed by Million 
Dollar Listing real estate agent Josh Altman as an 
8,500-square-foot 'innovatively scaled' home.

Rather than moving to another city, however, it appears the iconic doll decided to renovate her home of 41 years instead.

Getting girly: The Dreamhouse (1990 version pictured) seems to get pinker and pinker with each remodeling

Grand designs: By 1990, the house began to resemble its modern incarnation with its lavender walls and castle-like appearance

The
mansion was subtly transformed from its 2012 incarnation, which was 
just as pink but had just one elevator and five rooms, rather than six.

The additional room in the 2013 model is, unsurprisingly, a walk-in closet to accommodate the doll's ever-growing wardrobe.

In style, Barbie's Dreamhouse seems to get pinker and girlier with each remodeling.

Indeed, the first edition of the house in 1962, which was designed like a suitcase, had bright yellow walls, and the colors inside were considerably more gender 
neutral.

Dollhouse: Five years later, the walls were painted in Barbie's iconic baby pink

Modern amenities: An elevator in the mansion's turret connected the two floors

In 1973, Barbie's 
home took on a drastically different form, with a pointed roof with 
orange shingles and huge windows looking into the yellow interior.

Instead
of cardboard, this Dreamhouse was made of plastic and boasted two 
storeys, unlike the more modest bungalow of the Sixties.

By 1990, the house began to resemble its modern incarnation with its lavender walls and castle-like appearance.

Updated: The turn of the 21st century brought more ornate details to the home, which featured plastic windows, blue columns and a vanity in its 2001 version

Elaborate: The rooms of the elegant, French style home folded in to make it more compact

An
elevator was placed in the building's turret, and a balcony accessed 
from the master bedroom jutted out over the front of the house.

Five years later, the walls were painted in Barbie's iconic baby pink, and a huge bathtub was added.

And
the turn of the 21st century brought more ornate details to the home, 
which featured plastic windows, blue columns and a vanity in its 2001 
version.
