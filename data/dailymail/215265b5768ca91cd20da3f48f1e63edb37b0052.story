A prisoner strangled his wife during a visit to the sex cell after she told him that she was leaving him.

Ivan Milovanović, 35, is serving three years and ten months in the Penitentiary-Correctional Institution in Niš, southern Serbia for drugs trafficking.

He is said to have throttled 29-year-old Bojana Bacević when she told him that she was emigrating, reports the Belgrade-based daily Blic. 

Ivan Milovanović, 35 and serving three years and ten months behind bars for drugs trafficking, is said to have throttled 29-year-old Bojana Bacević during a conjugal visit when she told him that she was leaving the country

The jail has two 'love rooms', adapted cells where couples can have their conjugal rights for two hours once every two months.

'There are no guards and no CCTV and Milovanović and his wife had used the room several times in the past,' said a prison spokesman. He added that none of the guards nor the prisoner using the other 'love room' heard anything suspicious.

'When guards returned two hours after letting them into the room they found the visitor dead on the bed.

'The prisoner says he lost his temper when his estranged wife told him it would be the last visit,' the spokesman added.

Despite having left him Bojana Bacević still visited Ivan Milovanović for sex in the Penitentiary-Correctional Institution in Niš, southern Serbia

Milovanović was in jail for the fourth time, all drug trafficking-related offences.

The victim's sister Bobana Radić claimed the couple had already broken up but that she kept seeing him because she felt sorry for him.

'She hated to think of him being lonely and abandoned so she kept going, but she was planning a new life,' she told local media.

'He was a mean, violent man and I think he would have got angry when she broke the news to him,' she added.

She also alleged that Milovanović had told her he was going to kill her sister because she would be taking their daughter with him. After the murder, Mrs Radić was asked by social services to take the daughter but was unable because both she and her husband are unemployed and so the child was placed with her grandparents.

Bojana Bacević told her estranged husband that she was moving abroad. He could not handle this final rejection even though the couple had already separated and strangled her
