With tickets for next year's Rugby World Cup on sale from Friday, Sportsmail explains how to get your hands on tickets for the eagerly anticipated competition.

Which matches go on sale on Friday?

All 48 games. Fans can apply for up to four tickets per game. For 15 pool matches fans may request up to 15 tickets.

Application period?

Public sales begin on Friday and run until September 29. It’s not first come, first served, so there’s no rush to apply.

Where to apply?

On the official website, www.tickets.rugbyworldcup.com. Create an account to begin.

How will purchases be confirmed?

The application process will be finalised next month. If matches or price categories are over-subscribed, a ballot decides who gets the tickets.

Can I apply more than once?

Only one application is permitted per person — for just one or multiple games — but it is possible to edit or withdraw an application at any time during the process.

Cost of tickets?

Some seats cost as little as £15 for adults and £7 for children, but they go up to a high of £315 for pool games and £715 for the final.

Are England games affordable?

Prices are steep. The four price categories for their opening Pool A clash with Fiji are £75, £160, £215 and £315.

Concessions?

There are child prices for 41 of the 48 games, but not for the knockout fixtures, aside from the low-key ‘bronze medal match’.

Why so expensive?

This is the knock-on effect of the last World Cup, held in New Zealand, generating modest profits. Organisers need to meet an £80million guarantee to the IRB.

Any tickets been sold already?

Some 500,000 tickets went on sale to the ‘rugby community’ in May. Fan tour packages for the overseas market went on sale in January; hospitality packages have been available since February.

Any tips to secure tickets?

The application process features the ‘Match Manager’ element which regulates how many games you aim for and your potential spend. The ‘Increase Your Chances’ feature means if a match and category are over-subscribed, the next best category can be allocated instead.

Additional booking fees?

Not if applicants use a debit card or the credit card used is MasterCard — an official partner — but there is a two per cent charge for other credit cards.
