Red traffic lights will automatically turn green to speed chauffeur-driven dignitaries along special VIP lanes to the London Olympics, while millions of ordinary motorists face gridlock during the Games.

High-tech sensors have been buried in lanes that will be used by VIPs to ensure they cannot be held up by traffic lights, congestion or even people crossing the road.

Experts have warned that the express routes – even more exclusive than the ZIL lanes used by the Politburo in Soviet Moscow – will bring chaos to London's roads as thousands of spectators, commuters, taxis and commercial vehicles are forced off the main roadway into clogged bus lanes.

Wishful thinking: A TfL computer mock-up of how London's Embankment might look with its Olympic lane in place. Right, a typical gridlocked scene from the same road, with traffic clogging lanes in both directions

The Olympic route network

International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge, scandal-hit FIFA chief Sepp Blatter and executives from sponsors Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Visa are among those who will be whisked effortlessly across London.

An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has discovered that every individual journey taken by Games VIPs will be tracked by computer, allowing engineers to change lights to green if they are in danger of being delayed.

Inevitably, other road-users will find the lights turning red against them. Our investigation also found:

Under the terms of London's winning Olympic bid, organisers are expected to provide highly subsidised accommodation to the IOC, international sports federations including FIFA and world athletics body the IAAF and Games sponsors in opulent Park Lane hotels.

Organisers are also required to transport 82,000 people dubbed members of the 'Olympic Family' from the hotels to the main event locations in Stratford, East London, in 25 minutes. Olympic VIP cars will not be allowed to exceed speed limits.

Clear road ahead: FIFA president Sepp Blatter and partner Ilona Boguska. They will benefit from the preferential VIP treatment

As a result, Transport for London (TfL) and the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) received millions of pounds of Government cash to make unprecedented modifications to London's roads to meet the target times and ensure no VIP would be caught up in everyday traffic.

However, it is feared that the measures will result in thousands of ordinary people sitting in single-lane jams as Olympic vehicles speed past them using the exclusive Games Lanes.

Last night Mark Field, Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, said: 'What we are going to see on the streets of London, I fear, is something akin to a Third World nation, with limousines and BMWs being whisked through the traffic carrying hordes of self-appointed VIPs who have placed a raft of drastic and draconian conditions on us to be able to host the Games, while making life pretty unbearable for thousands of everyday Londoners.

'A great fanfare was made when we were all promised that London 2012 would be the most inclusive Games in history which would enrich the city.

'In reality, thousands of IOC members and a host of big-money sponsors and their entourage will be turning up in town expecting to be waited on hand and foot at the expense of everyone else.'

London transport chiefs have developed a computer programme called the ONE model that allows analysts to input travel itineraries into a traffic management system which then automatically changes lights to green as dignitaries pass along the route.

If the road remains clear, the signalling system will favour the Games Lane traffic, enabling the VIPs and dignitaries to arrive from their Park Lane hotels to the Olympic Stadium in the time agreed by the London 2012 bidding team and the IOC.

However, if there is congestion along the route, TfL's specialised SCOOT system – which was dramatically improved using £12million of public money – can alter traffic signals in the immediate and surrounding areas to further favour the VIP cars.

The SCOOT system uses pressure sensors built into the road to monitor the volume of traffic on specific busy London routes.

The sensors send information to traffic signals placed just yards away to decide the timings between light changes depending on congestion.

Staff monitoring the delegates' car fleet on computer screens in their Canary Wharf base can take the further step of instructing a team of 30 TfL engineers in South London to manually change lights along the Games Lane to green if the convoy is in danger of not arriving on time, giving the VIPs priority over other motorists.

Olympics organisers have also admitted that heads of state will be able to bypass traffic and access the exclusive roads on the advice of security services.

The 30-mile Games Lanes in London are part of a wider road map called the Olympic Route Network (ORN) linking Games venues and the surrounding areas.

The total network covers 109 miles of roads as some venues are outside London. Major traffic restrictions will be enforced along the whole route between 6am and midnight during the 30 days of Olympic and Paralympic events.

Organisers are still deciding whether to enforce the restrictions during a 15-day break between the Olympic and Paralympics – August 12 to 29 – even though very few dignitaries will be in London. These will include bans on parking and right turns, suspension of pedestrian crossings and phasing of traffic lights.

Some roads, including Constitution Hill and Birdcage Walk, surrounding Buckingham Palace will be completely closed to the public – providing sole access to the VIP vehicles and further disrupting journeys for ordinary motorists who will be forced to take alternative routes.

There will also be temporary ZIL lanes when Olympic events are taking place outside London. These will operate on the M4, M11, M3, M27 and A13.

The measures, which have cost £25million to implement, are solely aimed at speeding up Games traffic. But safety concerns have been raised over the removal of pedestrian crossings.

John Biggs, London Assembly Member for City and East, said: 'On some parts of the ORN it will not only be pretty horrendous for travellers, but some pedestrian crossings and right-hand turns which will be abolished previously had fatalities on them, which is a great cause for concern.

'We've spent a lot of time down the years putting in extra crossings and trying to reduce the impact of the traffic, and I think we need to be careful that we are not abandoning safety issues just to mollycoddle the Olympics bigwigs.'

Opposition: Steve McNamara, left, spokesman for the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association, said his members could take disruptive action. John Biggs, right, said the plans for VIP lanes would be 'horrendous' for travellers

Meanwhile the plan has led to a threat from London taxi drivers to hijack Olympic routes and bring the capital to a standstill in protest. They claim route restrictions will double journey times to some of the most popular shopping and tourist destinations.

Steve McNamara, spokesman for the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, said: 'Our members are extremely angry about the current plans and we can't rule out any disruptive action during the Games.

'Three years ago we did a demonstration in Trafalgar Square which brought the city to a standstill.

'All we want is somebody to see common sense and allow us to turn off the roads because at the moment we could be doubling our journey times as we aren't being permitted to turn right across these Games Lanes.'

The traffic plans come as a result of a 'Host City Contract' comprising a series of legally binding requirements drawn up in 2005 between the IOC and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG). It stipulates that 82,000 'Olympic Family' members – made up of athletes, officials and VIP guests – should be transported to event venues in times far faster than existing journey durations.

The fleet of Olympic Family vehicles 
is being provided by BMW in a sponsorship deal worth in excess of 
£40million. It will include a top-of-the-range BMW 520d which has a top 
speed of 144mph and reaches 0-60mph in 8.2 seconds.

Legendary rock band The Who are set to be the headline act for the closing ceremony of next year's London Olympics.

Founder members Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend have agreed to a request to perform but sources close to the band said details of the deal still had to be 'thrashed out'.

The Who are famed for their energetic performances – and their appearance at the Olympics will guarantee them a global audience of several billion.

The band was formed in 1964 by lead singer Daltrey, guitarist Townshend, bass player John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon.

Along with their musical success – they have sold about 100 million records – they also became known for their excessive lifestyle and drug-fuelled debauchery.

Charismatic drummer Moon died aged 32 in 1978 after overdosing on prescription pills. Entwistle died aged 57 in 2002.

Townshend and Daltrey continue to perform as The Who, and in 2006 released the album Endless Wire.

It
has also been rumoured that the German car-maker's Series 7 limousines,
worth £60,000, may be used because they can be upgraded with 
anti-missile warning systems, armour plating, bulletproof glass and 
sealed passenger areas to resist gas attacks.

The VIPs' Park Lane hotels are expected to include the five-star Intercontinental, Four Seasons, Metropolitan and the London Hilton Park Lane – where FIFA Committee members are believed to be staying.

Meanwhile, athletes will be allowed to travel along the Games Lanes, but only by bus or bicycle as they are excluded from using the luxury BMW saloon cars given to IOC chiefs and sponsors.

The athletes will have access to 400 BMW Pedelec electrically-assisted bicycles.

Competitors will make up just one-fifth of the total number of people accredited to use the Games Lanes, with most athletes expected to be staying on the Olympic Park.

Other vehicles in the fleet are 200 electric cars, including Mini Es and BMW 1 Series Active Es and R1200RT, R1200GS and F650GS BMW motorcycles. Hybrid cars may also be in operation.

The car fleet will be stored in Hyde Park next to Park Lane and at East London's Excel Centre. The 1,300 official buses will be parked at three depots at locations which are still to be finalised
