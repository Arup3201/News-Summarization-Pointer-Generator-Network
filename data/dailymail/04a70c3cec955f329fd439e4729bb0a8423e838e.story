The brutal video of the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig and at least 18 Syrian servicemen is being examined after an Australian is suspected to be have been involved in the latest ISIS attack.

Australian counter-terrorism officials are carefully looking over the video and images which for the first time identifies the Islamic State executioners carrying out the mass execution - as previous culprits have disguised their faces with hoods.

Foreign fighters were reportedly involved in the brutal atrocity as French officials have confirmed one Frenchman's involvement and a possible second executioner is yet to be confirmed.

The decapitation and moments before Kassig's death was not captured on the video - unlike the footage of Western hostages who previously suffered the same horrendous fate by the hands of ISIS militants

The French executioner has been identified as Maxime Hauchard, 22, who left northern France to go to Syria in August last year.

It is also believed that possibly an Australian, a Briton and also a Dane took part in the mass beheading, 7 News reported. 

Featuring in the video is an ISIS fighter speaking with a London accent who is believed to be Jihadi John - the man who is understood to be responsible for previous hostage killings.

Welshman Nasser Muthana from Cardiff is also thought to be among the killing squad.

Another distinct difference to previous Westerns slayings was there were no direct threats made against other Western hostages.

The high-definition video also showed the beheadings of about a dozen men identified as Syrian military officers and pilots, all dressed in blue jumpsuits. 

The confronting footage shows the prisoners marched out in a file line as the jiadists each take a military knife and make the prisoners kneel down before they are decapitated.
