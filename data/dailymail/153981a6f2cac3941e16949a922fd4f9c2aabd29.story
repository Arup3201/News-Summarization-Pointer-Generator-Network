A crossword writer has been accused of hiding a coded message to assassinate President Hugo Chavez's brother in a newspaper puzzle.

Venezuelan intelligence agents interviewed Neptali Segovia after a state TV pundit said his clues revealed a secret message to gun down Chavez's brother Adan.

It is the latest bizarre political story to emerge from the South American nation, which is having a particularly fraught year ahead of its elections.

Strong words: Answers to the crossword included 'Adan' (Chavez's brother), 'asesinen' (meaning 'kill') and 'rafaga' (which can mean either a burst of gunfire, or a gust of wind)

'These sorts of messages were used a lot
in World War Two,' said pundit Perez Pirela earlier this week, 
in a dramatic denouncement of Ultimas Noticias newspaper on live 
television.

Answers to the puzzle published on Wednesday included 'Adan', 
'asesinen' (meaning 'kill') and 'rafaga' (which can mean either a burst 
of gunfire, or a gust of wind). 

Mr Pirela, who uses an early evening TV 
show to criticise Chavez opponents, said mathematicians, 
psychologists and others had studied the Spanish-language crossword and 
concluded it was a coded assassination plot.

Ultimas Noticias said six officers from 
Venezuela's intelligence service visited the newspaper's editorial 
offices on Thursday asking for information about Segovia.

He then went voluntarily to the intelligence service's headquarters to give a statement, it added.

The accusation highlights the dangerously 
polarised environment in Venezuela, where socialist incumbent Chavez has been 
accusing opposition leaders of planning violence in the run-up to October's presidential vote.

Questions over cancer-suffering Chavez's condition have only heightened the tense atmosphere in the country.  

Pirela pointed out that French leader Charles de Gaulle used to 
broadcast coded messages from London to Resistance fighters in France 
during World War Two.

'It's a message... I'm speaking in the name of truth,' added Pirela.

'Assassination plot': Neptali Segovia was interviewed by intelligence officers after setting a puzzle that had some violent-sounding answers

But veteran crossword writer Segovia insisted that he was innocent, saying in the newspaper: 'I am the first to want to clarify this. I have nothing to hide because the work I have been doing for the last 17 years has only a cultural and education intention, and is transparent.  

'I was treated respectfully. They took down my comments and made a routine summary. Then they took me home.'      

Crosswords appear be the political tool of the moment, with another newspaper, the militantly pro-opposition Tal Cual, lampooning the Chavez government on Friday with a front-page game highlighting the nation's ills.

Clues included: 'What officials do when they misuse public funds' (Corruption); Perhaps the most abused law? (Constitution); and 'Name of supreme leader who governs our destiny? Bearded.' (Fidel Castro).
