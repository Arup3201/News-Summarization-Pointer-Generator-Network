She's one of the last people living on a boarded-up street and she's holding up a massive £650million regeneration project.

But, after living there for 30 years, grandmother Janet Capps won't budge from her home in Salford unless she's paid the market value.

Now council bosses in Salford, Greater Manchester, have had to apply for a legal order to force the 55-year-old from her two-bedroom house so she can make way for the wrecking ball.

Mrs Capps, and husband David, 65, had agreed in principle to move into a new three-bedroom house nearby - one of 1,500 being built under the Pendleton PFI scheme.

Negotiations stalled though over the value of their home, one of the last in Primrose Close in Pendleton, after Urban Vision, Salford council's regeneration arm, made a 'final offer' of £68,000.

The couple, who bought the home for £9,500 under right-to-buy rules and have spent £10,000 doing it up, believe the house is worth £80,000 to 90,000.

Mrs Capps, a supermarket worker, David, a scaffolder, are the last owner-occupiers on the condemned street not to have put pen to paper.

The 'Right to Buy' scheme has resulted in the sale of around two million council homes since the scheme was launched in 1980 under Margaret Thatcher.  

Initially, councils were obliged to use sales revenue to pay off debts before building new properties, which reduced the availability of council housing. 

Last year David Cameron proposed raising 'Right to Buy' discounts to help boost the housing market and generate finance to build new homes.

Qualifying tenants must live in self-contained properties which are main homes, rented from a public sector landlord for at least five years. Those who have previously lived in a now-sold council home could also be eligible for 'Preserved Right to Buy'.

Tenants are offered a maximum discount of 60 per cent for a house and 70 per cent for a flat, saving up to £75,000 on the value of their home. They will have to repay the discount if the property is resold within five years, while homes resold within ten years must be offered back to a local authority.

Now council papers reveal officials 
are to apply for a so-called compulsory purchase order, which would 
legally require them to move if they don't reach an agreement.

Mrs Capps,
a grandmother of one, said: 'Other people living here just took 
whatever they were offered and moved out straight away - they were just 
looking for a quick deal and some of the houses weren't in terribly good
condition.

'But we have put a lot into this house and feel it has been undervalued.'

The couple expect to move into their new £125,000 three-bedroom home, partly financed by a low-interest equity loan from Urban Vision, once a deal has been reached.

A Salford council spokesman said: 'Residents in the Athole Street clearance area, part of the Creating a New Pendleton project, were offered the right to reserve a new Pendleton Together home when they are completed, beginning in spring 2014.

'Additionally, support has been provided in the form of housing advice and financial compensation, including relocation equity loans to help with the move to a new home.

'All remaining occupiers on the Athole Street estate have agreed to move into the Pendleton Together new homes available from spring 2014.

'It is a matter of course that a CPO would be prepared for projects on a scale as large as this, to ensure the project can be completed on time.

'However, all residents in the Athole Street estate have agreed to move to the new homes, which means it is unlikely that the council would look to use this measure.'
