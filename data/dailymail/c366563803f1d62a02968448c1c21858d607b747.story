A lollipop lady was left trapped under a car after she tried to use her pole to protect schoolchildren from being run over after its driver lost control during a coughing fit.

Hero Karin Williams suffered two broken kneecaps, a shoulder injury and a head wound according to relatives as witnesses said the out-of-control Audi overturned after mounting a speed hump when the coughing driver stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake.

Ms Williams stood in front of the car's path in a bid to protect children making their way to school in Cardiff yesterday morning.

But the brave 50-year-old was hit along with five children and three adults.

Horrific: Witnesses saw the black Audi accelerate into the lollipop lady and a group of children walking to Rhoose Primary School at around 8.50am

'Very serious': Police said there were 'multiple casualties' as a result of the accident including adults and children

'Chaos': Witnesses said the road was 'choc-a-bloc' with children arriving for school at the time of the accident

Injured: Lollipop lady Karin Williams was said to have been left trapped beneath the Audi following the crash

A young girl who was one of those injured in the incident was last night in intensive care.

The driver of the Audi 80 – named locally as Bob Bell,
61 – and a female passenger, were among taken to hospital after the 
crash in the village of Rhoose in the Vale of Glamorgan.

None had 
life-threatening injuries, police said.

Mr Bell’s black Audi was seen spinning
in ‘mid-air’ before it careered into the group outside Rhws Primary 
School in the centre of the village, 15 miles outside Cardiff, at the 
start of the school day.

Witnesses described seeing  
50-year-old Mrs Williams trapped under the vehicle with blood pouring 
from her head after it came to a rest on the pavement.

A 39-year-old nurse who found Ms Williams trapped under the vehicle told The Sun: 'Karin had tried to save the kids by standing in the way of the car holding her pole out sideways to block it.

'I went over and she was conscious and could recognise me but had blood all over her face.

'She said, "I'm scared, I'm really scared. Please tell me it wasn't my fault."'

Shelly Morgan-Stone, 33, was taking 
her son Archie, seven, to the school when she saw the car ‘flying 
through the air’.

She added: ‘All I heard was a horrific screaming 
followed by the crash of metal and the sound of breaking glass and 
people running towards the scene.

‘One mother was on the floor on her knees, leaning over her child – she was wailing.

‘It was horrible, the screaming especially, I will never forget the sound of the mothers screaming.’

Another witness described seeing 
‘children lying injured in the road’, adding: ‘The lollipop lady was 
trapped – all I could see was her jacket from under the car.’

The 
injured were taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and 
the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.

Ian Morris, from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said the nine-year-old girl was in a paediatric intensive care unit.

Mrs Williams, who is German, met her 
husband Lyndon when he was in the Army and stationed in her homeland. 

Safety: The crash happened at the pedestrian crossing by Rhoose Primary School where the speed limit is just 20mph

Investigation: South Wales police say the 61-year-old male driver is helping with their inquiries - but it is not thought the accident was a deliberate act

Wreckage: The overturned Audi was take away on a recovery truck as police continue to investigate the crash

The couple have a daughter, Svenja, 22, a shop worker, and the trio live
in a flat just yards from the school.

Mr Williams is an ambulance 
driver, based at nearby Barry Ambulance Station, whose role involves 
taking elderly patients to and from hospital.

Earlier this year, Mrs Williams was 
recognised in the ‘Top of the Lollipops’ road safety awards organised by
the Vale of Glamorgan Council.

Neighbour Tommy Nettleship, 93, 
described her as a ‘lifesaver’ who visited him up to three times a day 
to keep him company and care for him.

He added: ‘Karin has virtually 
adopted me as her father.

‘She is a wonderful woman. She loves being a lollipop lady and is very dedicated.’

It is believed Mrs Williams knew Mr 
Bell, whose granddaughter lives with him and his wife in the village, 
which borders Cardiff Airport. A woman believed to be Mrs Bell refused 
to comment at the couple’s home last night.

Police said no other vehicles were involved in the 8.50am incident.

The school remained open yesterday, with an education psychologist sent in to work with pupils.

Chief Superintendent Joe Ruddy, of 
South Wales Police, said investigators would be examining the speed of 
the vehicle ‘among other circumstances’, and urged witnesses to contact 
the force.
