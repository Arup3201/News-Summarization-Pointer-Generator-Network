Finding the perfect man usually involves dates galore, the odd disappointment and the patience of a saint. But Dutch designer, Noortje de Keijzer, has come up with a simpler solution.

For those in need of someone to cuddle up to, she has invented 'Arthur', a boyfriend shaped pillow.

Along with Arthur, there's also a 'Steve' and, when stuffed, both are big, warm, cuddly and guaranteed to get along with friends, family and pets.

To personalise your man, de Keijzer's custom-made pillows come with accessories such as knitted ties, moustaches, glasses and even tattoos for those who prefer a rock n' roll type of guy.

'I created Arthur for the same reason I 
created the accessories: we do not all have the same taste in men,' explains de Keijzer.

'By 
making Steve and Arthur, I made an example of how you can easily choose 
your own kind of man in the production process - a different colour yarn
already makes a huge difference!'

The artist and designer is also creating a book featuring illustrations of all all the different things you can do with your man substitute, which include proving an embrace whenever you need it.

The woolly suits can be worn by real living men too, if the owner desires, but they don't come with any good behavior guarantees.

'I'm still busy developing this project and creating a book with all my drawings about My Knitted
Boyfriend, that will hopefully will be for sale in autumn,' says de Keijzer.

'This project is more about the story 
around My Knitted Boyfriend to me. I don't have serious ambitions to 
stop making people feel lonely (this is something everyone needs to do 
for themselves).

'I just try to bring out a smile or offer a 
feeling of recognition in order to start a conversation.'

Realistic: Cuddling up to Arthur and Steve looks even more comfortable than snuggling with a real man

Companion: The idea for Steve and Arthur came around after de Keijzer decided she needed a man in her life

Low maintenance: All Steve and Arthur need to stay happy is regular washing and plenty of cuddles

According to de Keijzer, the idea for the knitted boyfriend came about when she decided that she needed a man in her life.

'I could say that's a joke,' de Keijzer revealed to art websiteÂ Design Boom, 'but it is partly true.'

The result was Arthur and Steve, who 
were designed to be the perfect male companions, guaranteed not to do 
things like leave their pants on the bathroom floor, criticise your 
outfit or, horror of horrors, dump you.

But for those desperate to get their hands on a knitted boyfriend of their own, waiting is still the name of the game as, reveals de Keijzer, Steve and Arthur are prototypes.

'My Knitted Boyfriend is not yet in production and remains a hand- and custom made product,' she explains.

'It's always possible 
to have one made especially for you, but comes with a price of an 
exclusive hand made product.'

Those who already have an other half, can buy a My Knitted Boyfriend print from de Keijzer's website, which is topped with the sweet slogan: 'You are the best design I know'.
