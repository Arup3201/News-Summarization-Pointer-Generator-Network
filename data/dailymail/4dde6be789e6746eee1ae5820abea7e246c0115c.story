All the challenges for Vincenzo Nibali were overcome well before he arrived in Paris on Sunday evening to be crowned Tour de France winner.  

Traditionally a sprinters’ stage, the finale on the Champs-Élysées was little more than a celebration for Nibali, or eight laps of honour, at the end of which Germany’s Marcel Kittel claimed his fourth win ahead of Norway’s Alexander Kristoff.

Over the three weeks Nibali comprehensively dominated, and might have done so even if Chris Froome and Alberto Contador had not crashed out. The Sicilian conquered the hills of Yorkshire – winning in Sheffield – excelled over the cobbles and mud of northern Europe, then won in all three mountain ranges, in the Vosges, Alps and Pyrenees.

Even within Team Sky, whose Tour fell 
apart after losing Froome, there was an acknowledgment of the 
superiority of Nibali, the Italian who Sir Dave Brailsford tried to 
sign, on a salary of two million Euros, when he was setting up the team 
in 2009.  

Brailsford 
refused to say that Froome would have won had he not crashed, saying ‘it
 would be disrespectful to Nibali’ to speculate. Rod Ellingworth, the 
Sky performance manager, was even more gracious. Asked whether Nibali 
would still have won had Froome and Contador not been forced out, he 
replied, ‘I don’t see why not. Staying on your bike is part of winning a
 Grand Tour.’

Indeed, in 
this Tour of many crashes, it is significant that all of the riders in 
the top four managed to stay upright. The last Tour winner to suffer a 
serious crash en route to victory was Bernard Hinault in 1985.  

That
 was also the last home win, though perhaps they will not have to wait 
29 years for the next one. Two Frenchmen, Jean-Christophe Peraud and 
Thibaut Pinot, finished on the podium, Romain Bardet was sixth, and 
arguably the most talented of the lot, 22-year-old Warren Barguil, is 
expected to make his Tour debut in 2015.

VIDEO Nibali completes triple crown

Nibali
 began as an outsider after a lacklustre season that some blamed on the 
birth of his daughter, Emma, in February. ‘The curse of the bambino’, or
 the distraction and pressure of becoming a father, meant that Nibali 
had a slow start.  

‘The 
first part of the season was very difficult,’ he acknowledged. ‘My 
daughter was born – I’m not saying it’s a problem, of course, it’s a 
great source of happiness – but I preferred to stay with my family, my 
wife, and it slowed down my preparation.

‘I was a bit late in maturing this season, but I still continued to believe in reaching this objective, the Tour.’

Nibali,
 who once said that doping was equivalent to theft, and that offenders 
deserved to be ‘locked up,’ also claimed that he wouldn’t have reached 
this lofty peak, becoming only the sixth rider to win all three Grand 
Tours, if drug-testing hadn’t improved.  

‘In
 2008 I was a bit disappointed and sad,’ he said. Doping was rampant, 
with the Tours from 2006 to 2008 Tours producing countless positive 
tests.  

‘Without the 
biological passport [introduced in 2008] and the targeted controls, I 
might not be here,’ he added. ‘A lot of progress has been made [in 
anti-doping] and today we have the right results.’
