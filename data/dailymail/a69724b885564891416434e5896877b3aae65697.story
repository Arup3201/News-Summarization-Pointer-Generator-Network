Captured: Delta Force commandoes pulled al-Qaeda terrorist Abu Anas al-Libi off the streets of Tripoli after a 15-year manhunt

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has defended the capture of a terrorism suspect by American forces in Libya, saying complaints about the operation from Libya and others are unfounded.

The family of al-Qaeda terrorist Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Rugai, also known as Abu Anas al-Libi, who was captured by American Delta Force commandos has described the moment that he was snatched off the streets of Tripoli, Libya as a 'kidnapping'.

Kerry said the weekend seizure in Tripoli of the suspected al-Qaida operative Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai complied with U.S. law.

The suspect's son Abdullah al-Ruqaie described the capture to the UK's Daily Telegraph.

'He was coming back from the mosque, at 6:38 in the morning,' he said.

'Four vehicles stopped by his car, in front of the house, and ten masked and unmasked men came out, broke the car window on the steering wheel side, drugged him, and took him.

'He was kidnapped in front of the house not inside. If he had been kidnapped inside the house we would not have let them take him without a fight,' he said.

Kerry, speaking from Bali where he is attending an Asia-Pacific economic conference, said the suspect was a 'legal and appropriate target' for the U.S. 
military and will face justice in a court of law.

He added it was 
important not to 'sympathize' with wanted terrorists.

'I hope the perception is in the world that people who commit acts of terror and who have been appropriately indicted by courts of law, by the legal process, will know that United States of America is going to do anything in its power that is legal and appropriate in order to enforce the law and to protect our security,' Kerry told reporters after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

'I think it's important for people in 
the world not to sympathize with alleged terrorists but to underscore 
the importance of the rule of law,' he added, when asked about the 
Libyan government's complaint that the seizure amounted to kidnapping. 
Libya has asked Washington to explain and clarify its actions.

Al-Ruqai was seized on the streets of the 
Libyan capital on Saturday. He is accused by the U.S. of involvement in 
the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and 
Nairobi, Kenya, which killed more than 220 people.

He
has been on the FBI's most wanted terrorists list since it was 
introduced shortly after the September 11, 2001 attack, with a $5 million 
bounty on his head. He was
indicted by federal prosecutors in 2000 and has evaded capture for 15 
years.

Kerry, a former prosecutor, noted that al-Libi has been indicted by a U.S. court and will have a chance to defend himself.

'An indictment is an accusation,' Kerry said.

'In
our legal system the defendant is presumed innocent until proven 
guilty, but he will now have an opportunity to defend himself and to be 
appropriately brought to justice in a court of law.'

Al-Rugai was 
quickly flown out of Libya and is likely to be extradited to New York to
stand trial for helping to plan the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in 
Nairobi, Kenya.

His capture, 
during one of two nearly simultaneous raids in Africa Saturday, is being
heralded as a major victory for American counter-terrorism forces.

Al-Libi's brother, Nabih, called the raid 'an act of piracy.'

American officials said they told the
Libyan government about the raid in Tripoli, but Prime Minister Ali 
Zeidan has said he was never informed about the operation. He issued a statement demanding an explanation of the raid. 

He called the capture of al-Libi a 'kidnapping' and said he should have been tried in Libya.

The two operations in Africa, carried out by the best-equipped and most
heavily trained commandos in the United States, come a week and a half 
after al-Shabab terrorists slaughtered 67 people during a massacre at 
the upscale Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.

Secretary
of State John Kerry, attending a conference in Bali, Indonesia, 
trumpeted the raids, saying 'members of al-Qaeda and other terrorist 
organizations literally can run but they can’t hide.'

He added: 'We hope that this makes 
clear that the United States of America will never stop in it’s effort 
to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror.'
