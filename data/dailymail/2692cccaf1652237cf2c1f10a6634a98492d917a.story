Among the qualities required in the heat of a relegation battle, a cool head and composure always come in handy. Step forward Joey Barton.

The QPR captain has spent much of his controversial career tackling his demons and trying to control his anger, not always with the greatest success.

Even by his questionable standards, however, the red card Barton received in the 32nd minute at the KC Stadium was stupid in the extreme.

It left his team having to play for the best part of an hour with only 10 men, having already gone a goal down.

They hit back to equalise through Charlie Austin but couldn’t hold on and conceded a crucial late goal from Dame N’Doye as fellow strugglers Hull celebrated what could prove to be a priceless victory in the fight for Premier League survival.

There was no need for Barton to get involved when Darnell Furlong marred an otherwise impressive debut by lunging into a tackle on Nikica Jelavic. As Hull’s players complained and referee Anthony Taylor reached for his yellow card to book the youngster, Barton positioned himself at the centre of the melee to try and defend his teammate.

He pushed Alex Bruce and then responded to a shove in the back from Tom Huddlestone by swinging a low blow into his opponent’s groin.

The ninth red card of Barton’s career duly followed, further blotting the disciplinary record of a player who had come into this game with a Premier League record seven consecutive yellows against his name.

Barton apologised to his team-mates and the club’s fans on Twitter afterwards, but the incident was reminiscent of his sending-off on the last day of the season at Manchester City in 2012 when he saw red and received a 12-match ban for elbowing Carlos Tevez, kneeing Sergio Aguero and then trying to headbutt Vincent Kompany.

QPR were fighting for their lives that day as well. They survived despite Aguero’s late title winner, but the price of this defeat could be altogether more costly.

‘You can’t go punching people in the knackers, can you?’ said Hull manager Steve Bruce. ‘I didn’t see the incident but everyone tells me that what he did was just ridiculous.’

New QPR head coach Chris Ramsey dismissed suggestions that he could now strip Barton of the captaincy.

He said: ‘Joey apologised to the boys straightaway (at half-time). I’m sure he will be the first one to put his hand up and admit that he probably should have acted in a different manner.

‘It’s always difficult when you have players who have that bit of edge. We’ll have a chat when I see him next which will probably be Sunday or Monday.

‘I’m more disappointed than anything for the hard work that seems to have gone down the drain.’

Hull went ahead in the 16th minute when Steven Caulker headed Huddlestone’s high freekick straight to Jelavic who executed a clinical right-foot volley into the bottom corner.

Despite Barton’s dismissal, QPR equalised six minutes before the interval when Austin got in between Bruce and Michael Dawson to meet Matt Phillips’s cross with a glancing header.

Austin, who missed out on a £4.5million move to Hull in 2013 after failing the medical due to concerns over his knee, celebrated by hobbling off the pitch.

‘I congratulated him afterwards,’ said Hull boss Steve Bruce. ‘Our loss was certainly QPR’s gain.’

But N’Doye, Bruce’s new £2.2m deadline day signing from Lokomotiv Moscow, settled it with his second goal in two games as he headed in from Robbie Brady’s cross late on.

Barton took to Twitter after the final whistle to publicly apologise to his QPR team-mates following his moment of madness at the KC Stadium. 

He wrote: 'Young kid making his debut has made a good tackle. Couple of Hull players trying to get him sent off. My job as captain is to protect him. 

'I've tried to prevent Hull's players influencing referee as u can see by me pushing [Alex] Bruce away. 

'My actions towards Huddlestone were certainly not malicious, it was a stupid reaction to being barged but I can appreciate it wasn't right. 

'I'm gutted I got sent off. I've let my team-mates down today and being someone who puts the team above everything else I'm gutted about that. 

'I've apologised to the lads and would like to apologise to all QPR fans who travelled today.'
