She was arguably Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister.

But had Margaret Thatcher been given the benefit of hindsight, she would never have even set foot in the House of Commons.

In a shock confession, she told a senior Conservative MP how she regretted her career choice because of the effect it had on her home life.

Regret: Baroness Thatcher, pictured with husband Denis and children, Mark and Carol, in 1959, says she wished she hadn't gone into politics because of what it did to her family

In a meeting with Lord Spicer in April 1995, she told him: 'If I had my time again, I wouldn't go into politics because of what it does to your family.'

Her admission has been revealed in a set of diaries by Lord Spicer published in the Sunday Telegraph today.

She had been loyally supported by her husband, Denis, during her time in office until his death in 2003.

But her son, Sir Mark, gained a reputation for being a playboy and once went missing for six days during the Paris-Dakar rally.

Admission: Baroness Thatcher makes a speech in the House of Commons on November 21, 1990, the day before she resigns. A few months later, she told Lord Spicer how she hated 'coming to his place now'

He lives in Spain and visits his mother every four to six weeks.

His twin sister, journalist Carol, appeared on TV reality show I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2005.

According to reports, she can go months without seeing the 86-year-old despite her declining mental health.

The ex-PM's two grandchildren live in Texas with Sir Mark's former wife, Diane.

The Spicer Diaries also claim Baroness Thatcher was already disillusioned by politics years before her admission in 1995.

After stepping down as prime minister in November 1990, she told Lord Spicer in the Commons: 'I hate coming to this place now.'
