As a demonstration of how well-drilled New York City officials are in how to deal with Ebola, it left a lot to be desired.

Two New York City police officers who attended the Harlem apartment building of Dr Craig Spencer - the first confirmed Ebola case in the city - were observed afterward dumping their protective gear and caution tape in a garbage bin on the street.

While it was not immediately clear if the two officers had been inside Dr Spencer's apartment, the episode had many people asking if the equipment should not have been disposed of in a biohazard bag - even if only as a precaution.

Is that where that goes? The NYC police officers marking off the area around Dr Craig Spencer's apartment in Harlem earlier this afternoon

No but really, should that go there?: The men were seen throwing caution tape along with their masks and gloves in a trash can

Are we really doing this?: Not just any trash can, but one on a public street corner

Jitters spread through New York on Thursday after it was revealed Dr Spencer spent seven days in the city after returning from Africa with the Ebola virus in his bloodstream. 

On Tuesday, Dr Spencer described suffering from fatigue and exhaustion. He took the subway from his home in Harlem to popular tourist spot the High Line, a park created on a disused railway line in Chelsea.

He stopped at Blue Bottle Coffee stand and then had lunch at The Meatball Shop in Greenwich Village.

On Wednesday morning, the doctor went running for three miles on Riverside Drive and the Westside Highway in Manhattan. That evening, he took the subway to The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

He later took an Uber cab ride home to Harlem.

The doctor was not advised to quarantine himself for 21 days on his return to the U.S. but had been monitoring his temperature twice a day.

While officials say he had no symptoms at the time of these activities and was therefore almost surely not infectious, many New Yorkers are worried all the same.

Dr Spencer, whose case was confirmed Thursday evening, had been in Guinea this past September with Doctors With Borders, helping to treat patients infected with the virus. 

Keeping it covered: It is uncertain if the men were at any point in the apartment on Dr. Spencer

Unlucky passersby: These folks are likely unaware of what is happening

Get it all in there: The men discarded everything in the trash can

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio reminded the public in his press conference tonight that, 'Ebola is an extremely difficult disease to get,' then adding that, 'Every hospital in the city is prepared in the event other patients come forward.'

However, New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo, speaking at the same press conference, said four people were potentially exposed to Dr. Spencer 'during the relevant period.' 

They are Dr Spencer's fiancee, two friends, and the driver of a taxi he rode in.

There was no word during the press conference as to how prepared police officers were to deal with the deadly virus.
