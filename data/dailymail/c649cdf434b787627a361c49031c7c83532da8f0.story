Frank Lampard turned down the suggestion that he was a genius on a visit to the commentary box at a New York Yankees game.

The former Chelsea midfielder is making the most of his time off in the US after sealing his move to newly-formed New York City FC and popped in to join regular broadcasters Michael Kay and Paul O'Neill during a Yankees game on Sunday.

Lampard famously scored highly in an IQ test during his time at Chelsea, recording one of the highest set of marks ever recorded by the company doing the tests, while he was also once noted as the only Premier League footballer with a Latin GCSE to his name.

But the 36-year-old, who will only link up with his new club when the next MLS season begins next year, laughed off suggestions that he was a genius as he chatted with the hosts who even jokingly offered him a place at Harvard University.

'I'm not a genius,' Lampard responded. 'The IQ went well but I'm not sure about that.

'I've made lots of silly mistakes, I'm not sure I'm a genius but I showed up well in the test.'

And Lampard also spoke out about his excitement at making an 'imprint' on the new team.

'It's a great vision. I spoke to the people who are leading this and they want to build something special.

'New York City is an amazing city, the MLS is a great league and it's improving all the time so for me it was just a win-win to come over here and get a different chance, a different league and I want to try and do well.

'They sold a great story to me about how this club's going to be so I can't wait.'

Lampard later spoke again about the incident involving American tourists shortly after the 9/11 attacks and again stated his intention to set things straight on the matter during his time in New York.
