The branches of Mitt Romney's family tree can be seen stretching into Mexico as new light is shed on the presidential contender's roots.

Mr Romney’s great-grandfather Miles Park Romney fled to Mexico's Chihuahua desert in 1885 to escape anti-polygamy laws in the U.S.

He had five wives.

The region, now plagued by a volatile 
drug war and threats from violent gangsters, is where three dozen of 
Mitt Romney’s relatives call home.

Romeny's father George was born in Mexico before moving back to the U.S. as a small child.

Pursued by U.S. Marshals following the 1882 crackdown on polygamists, Miles Park Romney set up shop in Mexico with other Mormon settlers.

Michael Romney, one of Mitt's cousins, told the Washington Post that his  great-grandfather's wives 'lived like sisters.'

Today, however, the Mormons of northern Mexico no longer practice polygamy, and the Mormon church officially banned the practice in 1890.

In his 2004 book Turnaround, Mitt Romney wrote: 'Despite emigrating, my great-grandfather never lost his love of country.'

While the Romney name is a political powerhouse in the U.S., his relatives staying in Mexico are feeling pressure from a violent drug war.

Two years ago, Mr Romney’s cousin Meredith Romney was kidnapped and held for ransom in a cave for three days.

Meredith Romney, 70, said: 'I just figured my time was up. I later found out they’d kidnapped 18 people and killed 14 of them.'

Despite the threat of reprisals, the Mexico Romneys are standing firm.

Michael Romney said: 'We’re not going anywhere. There’s too much history.'

The Romney family can be traced as far back to 17th century Great Britain, when William Romney served as lord mayor of London.
