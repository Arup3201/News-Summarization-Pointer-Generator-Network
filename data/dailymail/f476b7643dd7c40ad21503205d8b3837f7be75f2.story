The iPhone 6 won't be in the hands of consumers until Friday, but Apple-obsessed Americans can now rest easy knowing the long-awaited electronics have arrived stateside.

Or so says a pilot who's taken photos upon landing in Alaska of what he claims are mounds of the coveted devices in his plane's cargo hold.

They're all bound up for safe keeping during the flight over from China, but according to the pilot there are plenty to go around.

'I just flew 195,000 iPhone 6 & 6+ from China to US,' the pilot, under the username goforblacksky, wrote on the web forum MacRumors on Monday.

For fellow posters who thought that didn't sound like enough of the wildly popular phones, the pilot offered some reassurance.

'Believe me, this is not the only airplane hauling stuff. I'm guessing about 20 - 30 heavy's a day coming out of China,' he wrote. 'Another crew will take the airplane on to Chicago. It'll be on the ground at O'hare about 9am Sept. 15.'

Another photo posted on the forum showed a plane being loaded up in China with iPhones. 

A search for the tail number of that plane indicated the aircraft has crisscrossed from several cities in China to Germany, Austria, Los Angeles, Chicago as well as Alaska and others over the last several days.

The pilot even made a joke for the particularly eager.

On the inside: The photos taken by MacRumors commenter goforblacksky quickly became nearly as coveted as the new iPhones, which become available Friday

Apple Inc said many customers will need to wait until next month for their new iPhones after a record 4 million first-day pre-orders were logged, double the number for the iPhone 5 two years ago.

The company said demand had outstripped supply of the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which feature larger screens and longer battery life. 

Deliveries of pre-orders will begin on Friday and will continue through October.

Bumper first-day pre-orders point to first-weekend sales of up to 10 million units, analysts estimated.

About 2 million pre-orders were received for the iPhone 5 in the first 24 hours after it went on sale in September 2012. Apple sold 5 million of these phones in the first weekend.

Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5Ss and 5Cs, which were launched last year, in the first three days in stores. The company did not reveal pre-order numbers for these phones.

Raymond James analysts said they expect sales of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to top 9 million in the first weekend.

The company routinely grapples with iPhone supply constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone re-design.

The company said the new iPhone models will be available to customers in its stores in the United States, Canada, Australia and some other countries on Friday morning.

AT&T Inc, Sprint Corp, T-Mobile US Inc, Verizon Wireless and some Apple authorized resellers will also start selling the phones on Friday.

'I gave it a little extra gas coming over the Pacific, just to get them here a little quicker. You're welcome.'  

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be delivered to customers starting Friday and throughout September, but many won't be delivered until October, Apple said. Phones will still be available Friday on a walk-in basis at Apple retail stores and from various wireless carriers and authorized Apple resellers.

Apple's website had intermittent outages last Friday because of heavy traffic as orders began online. The company said the 4 million orders set a new 24-hour record, beating the 2 million orders in 2012. That was for the iPhone 5, the previous time Apple increased the iPhone's screen size.

Last year, Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c phones in the first three days they were on sale, but the company didn't say how many came in the first 24 hours of advance orders.
