A Colombian dubbed the 'most dangerous and wanted drugs trafficker in the world' has been arrested at a restaurant in Buenos Aires after police placed satellite tracking devices in his fleet of supercars.

Carrying false passports from five countries and posing as a Venezuelan businessman, Henry de Jesus Lopez, nicknamed 'Mi Sangre,' or 'My Blood,' was led away from the Fettuccine Mario restaurant in the Pilar area of the city by armed police on Tuesday evening.

The multi-millionaire former foot soldier of notorious drugs baron Pablo Escobar is accused of shipping tons of cocaine to the United States through Central America.

Notorious drug trafficker Henry de Jesus Lopez was led away from the Fettuccine Mario restaurant by armed police on Tuesday

He resorted to plastic surgery in a desperate attempt to try and evade capture but was still made to wear a bullet proof vest as he was escorted from his favourite restaurant in order to protect him from assassins.

Lopez fled his native city of Medellin in Colombia two years ago after his accountant was arrested. Police said the key to tracking the father of two down was a Colombian 
informant who reported his location and movements. The informant, whose 
identity is being protected, will be paid a reward worth $660,000.

Lopez and a bodyguard were captured without a shot fired said police.

Speaking in the Colombian capital of Bogota national police director General Jose Roberto Leon said 41-year-old Lopez ran the 'Urabenos' gang based in northern Colombia after rising through the ranks of right-wing paramilitary groups that doubled as drug trafficking operations.

The group takes its name from the Gulf of Uraba on Colombia's Caribbean coast, from which U.S. law enforcement officials say it shipped tons of cocaine northward.

Argentine Security Secretary Sergio Berni described Lopez as 'the most dangerous and wanted drugs trafficker in the world'.

He is the latest in a series of Colombian traffickers to be arrested at far flung locations - in Venezuela, in Bolivia and now in Argentina - as Colombian authorities and dozens of DEA agents systematically attempt to capture the country's kingpins and begin working their way down the chains of command of the remaining organized crime rings.

'Colombia now effectively has no more 'capos' of regional or national reach,' said Oscar Naranjo, who retired as Colombia's national police director in July.

'He was one of the few left in Central and South America at that level,' a U.S. law enforcement official said. 'Now you have the second tier.'

The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, said Lopez was accused in a U.S. criminal complaint of shipping 'multi-ton loads' of cocaine to the United States.

Lopez entered Argentina with his wife and child late last year, settling them into a house in the gated community of Nordelta, where many wealthy Argentines and foreigners have waterfront homes.

But Berni said he left his family there and moved constantly, jumping from property to property north of the capital, living under assumed names and protected by as many as eight bodyguards.

Lopez carried false passports from Argentina, Paraguay, Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela, and recently traveled through Paraguay and Venezuela in hopes of throwing pursuers off his trail.

In the end, a team of Colombian judicial police installed in Argentina caught him with help from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and a small group of Argentine officials.

Berni emphasized the Argentine role, attributing the arrest to 'a very thorough investigation' by his agency and federal forces. He said President Cristina Fernandez had personally approved the necessary resources.

Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos sent a Twitter message overnight thanking his country's police and Argentine authorities for the arrest.

Without offering any details, Berni also said that Lopez trafficked drugs in Argentina during his stay, and that investigations continue.

Lopez is accused of organized crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, and is wanted in Colombia as well as Miami. Authorities are now evaluating which country Argentina should send him to, Gen. Leon said.

He could be expelled by Argentina to Colombia, which would in turn extradite him to the United States, whose prisons house scores of Colombian drug traffickers.
