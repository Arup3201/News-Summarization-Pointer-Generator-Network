Drink-driver: Paul Hastings, 45, was so drunk that he tried to pay for fuel at a petrol station despite not having filled up, a court has heard

A company director was so drunk that he tried to pay for fuel at a petrol station despite not having filled up, a court has heard.

Paul Hastings, 45, was almost four times over the legal drink-drive limit when he drove into a garage in Hebburn, near Newcastle.

He stumbled across the forecourt before attempting to pay for petrol - even though he hadn’t put any in his car.

He then climbed back into his vehicle and swerved toward a pump, nearly crashing into other motorists.

Hastings, who runs Hastings Metal Finishers in Hebburn with his brother Alan, recorded a breath test reading of 136mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath when tested by police - well above the legal limit of 35mcg.

He has been handed a nine-week suspended jail sentence after admitting drink-driving at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court.

Hastings, who has three children, had argued with his brother just hours before the incident on December 10, the court heard.

This caused him to 'drink to excess', before he climbed into his car and drove to the Jet garage in Victoria Road at about 6.30pm.

Glenda
 Beck, prosecuting, said: 'Police were called about a possible drink 
driver at a garage after the cashier said a man had entered and asked to
 pay for some fuel.

'The till showed that no fuel had been drawn from a pump and the man was showing signs of drunkenness.

Scene: The company director was almost four times over the legal drink-drive limit when he drove into this Jet garage in Hebburn, near Newcastle

Appearance: Hastings (pictured, right, arriving at court with a companion) had parked at a pump (pictured on the left) but the petrol station's till showed no fuel had been drawn when he went to pay

'When he was told he had not taken any fuel, he left the station store and went back to his Volkswagen Golf vehicle. 

'He
 was walking back and forth and was unsteady on his feet. When he got in
 his car to drive, he nearly collided with other cars 
on the forecourt.'

Ian Cruickshank, defending, said Hastings' argument with his brother had 'hit him hard'.

'We have a wholly exceptional set of circumstances which are never to be repeated,' he said.

'Mr Hastings had an argument with his 
brother, which hit him hard. It caused him to do something he never does
 - which was to drink to excess and alone.

'The mistake he made is that he didn’t believe he had drank so much.'

He added: 'The reading is very high, but he was wholly co-operative and submitted to the roadside test.

'He runs a company with his brother and had no convictions or cautions until this matter. This has been hanging over his head and he knows you have the power to commit him to custody.

'He should be given full credit for his early guilty plea.'

Case: Hastings has been handed a nine-week suspended jail sentence after admitting drink-driving at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court (pictured). He has also been banned from driving for two years and eight months

Sentencing Hastings, magistrates’ 
chairwoman Yvonne Cracknell said: 'We believe this offence is so serious
 that only custody can be justified.

'We sentence you to 12 weeks in custody, reduced to nine due to your early guilty plea, but it will be suspended for two years.'

As well as the suspended jail term, Hastings has been banned from driving for two years and eight months.

He has also been sentenced to 250 hours of unpaid work, and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £80.
