The Kansas City man who confessed to killing the 27-year-old wife of his prayer group leader has asked his lawyers to get the confession excluded from his upcoming trial because he was under the influence of a demonic exorcism at the time. 

Micah Moore, 25, claims he wasn't in his right mind in November 2012 when he confessed to killing Bethany Deaton, his attorneys said, and recanted it after getting some sleep.

Moore initially told investigators leader Tyler Deaton had ordered him to kill Bethany to keep her from revealing the group's secrets, including that Deaton was having sexual relations with other male members. 

Bethany's body was found inside her locked minivan at Longview Lake on October 30, 2012, with a loosely tied bag over her head and a suicide note and empty 100-count bottle of acetaminophen nearby.

On the basis of that evidence, the Jackson County coroner initially listed the cause of death as suicide.

Other than Moore's confession, there is no evidence Bethany's death was the result of a crime, Moore's attorneys wrote.

Her embalmed body was returned to Kansas City from Texas for an autopsy and the cause of death was changed to 'undetermined.'

Moore and Deaton were part of a roughly 20-member prayer group who came to the Kansas City area from Texas to be part of International House of Prayer University (IHOP), an evangelical Christian organization focused on missions and preparation for the end of time.

Members lived in a communal-type arrangement in Grandview, where Tyler Deaton controlled everything from how members spent their free time to when they were required to worship, Moore's attorneys said.

After Bethany Deaton's death, IHOP conducted a meeting to help members of the prayer group process their grief, 'as they said that Tyler had not allowed them to grieve her death,' IHOP spokesman Nick Syrett said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.

'That this was a planned 'exorcism' meeting is simply not true,' he said. 

Moore's attorneys, however, describe Bethany Deaton as a deeply disturbed woman whose husband of only two months rejected her physical advances and had her shunned by the rest of the group, driving her to suicide.

'At a time when she had been physically rejected in the most humiliating way a woman can be rejected, she was also being socially rejected,' the motion asserts.

During an evening prayer session on November 8, 2012, an IHOP-affiliated group called Prisoners of Hope put 'their hands on the cult members, shouting at demons to leave and scream-praying in tongues, soon had many in the group crying and yelling and falling to the floor,' Moore's attorneys wrote.

Syrett said Moore confessed to two IHOP leaders and asked them to accompany him to a local police station, where he was charged with first-degree murder on November 9, 2012.

'This meeting was to help these young people process recent events and to hear their hearts related to these events,' Syrett said. 'It was not in the slightest way for the purpose of 'exorcising' demons out of people.'

A message left on Tyler Deaton's Facebook page and an email to his father seeking comment were not immediately returned.

Tyler Deaton is not suspected of any involvement in his wife's death at this time. 

Micah Moore, 23, who was a member in Deaton's religious sect and lived with him and his wife in Grandview, Missouri, has been charged with killing Bethany in 2012 and making it look like a suicide.

Moore initially accused Deaton of giving him the order to kill his wife for fear that she might tell her therapist about being the victim of several sexual assaults, according to court documents. But Moore later recanted his confession.

In January 2013, Moore, 23, pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Bethany Ann Deaton, whose body was found on October 30 in a van at Longview Lake, Kansas.

There was an empty pill bottle by her, a bag over her head and a suicide note, indicating to police she had taken her own life.

After the 23-year-old confessed, he said that Bethany's husband Tyler Deaton told him to do it.

His attorney later said it was the act of a distraught and confused young man under extreme psychological pressure and that no actual evidence of a crime existed and that his confession.

Moore is currently free on $250,000 bond, according to the Kansas City Star.

It was claimed in December 2012 that Tyler Deaton was involved in sexual affairs with at least three other men who lived at the religious community he led.

The charismatic Christian was in charge of a group whose members came to Kansas City from Texas to be part of the International House of Prayer.

After the arrest of Moore, several men who lived in the house told detectives they had been involved in 'secret' sexual relations with Deaton.

Court records have redacted these men's names but, one witness told police that Deaton mentioned having dreamed that 'he had killed his wife by suffocating her,' a week after her death.

The Deatons' other roommates told police of alleged sexual relationships by Deaton to 'discover his masculinity,' because he was 'frustrated' that he 'couldn't get an erection' with his wife according to the probable cause statement seen by the Daily Beast.

Another member interviewed by detectives investigating the case said that one night he was lying in bed and that 'Tyler had laid next to him and held him.'

'He stated that he realized now that Tyler was attempting to make him a member of their sexual group.'

Another man who lived in the home in Kansas City said that 'he was involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with Deaton' and said that he 'was controlling and manipulative and said that the sexual activity was part of a religious experience'.

A third man said in his statements to police that he had been in a sexual relationship with Deaton and named him as the household's 'spiritual leader.'

He claimed that in the weeks prior to his wife's death Deaton had become 'angry' and 'frustrated'.

Bethany Deaton was found dead in the back seat of a van on October 30 with a white plastic bag over her head, a purple pillow beside her and an empty pill bottle nearby.

Authorities in Missouri initially believed the death to be a suicide as they found a disturbing and tragic note next to her body.

'My name is Bethany Deaton. I chose this evil thing,' read the letter.

'I did it because I wouldn't be a real person and what is the point of living if it is too late for that?

'I wish I had chosen differently a long time ago. I knew it all and refused to listen. Maybe Jesus will still save me.'

However, on November 9, three days after her funeral, Micah Moore, a member of Mr. Deaton's IHOP walked into the Grandview Police Department and told officers that he had killed Bethany.

Since then allegations of repeated sexual assaults inflicted upon Bethany by male members of the IHOP have emerged, with the shocking suggestion that they may have been filmed on an iPad.

It was three days after the death of Bethany that Moore, 23, walked into the Grandview Police department and confessed to her murder.

'I killed her,' he told officers, according to court documents, adding that he had placed the bag over her head and 'held it there until her body shook.'

While Moore has been charged with first-degree murder of Bethany, authorities are still investigating Deaton, who has been described as a 'Pied-Piper' like leader.

Since his wife's death, authorities in Missouri have said that Deaton - who on his Facebook page lists Harry Potter and learning foreign languages as 'likes' - has returned to Texas.
