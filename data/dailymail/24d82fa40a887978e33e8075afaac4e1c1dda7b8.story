More than 1,200 weapons, including firearms and Taser stun guns, were confiscated from New York schoolchildren last year, police have revealed.

Knives were the most common weapons seized from students during the 2013/14 academic year, including razor blades and fold-up knives disguised as credit cards, figures released by the New York Police Department showed.

But officers also took nine guns and 44 BB airguns which can fire pellets at a velocity of between 275 to 350 feet-per-second - about half that of a .25 caliber handgun.

Metal detected: Around 42 per cent of the weapons were recovered after tip-offs from staff or students while 712, 58 per cent, were picked up by metal detectors at school gates

Around 42 per cent of the weapons were recovered after tip-offs from staff or students while 712, 58 per cent, were picked up by metal detectors at school gates, reported the New York Post, which published the figures.

Police told the newspaper that children do not bring weapons to school because they intend to do harm, rather they arm themselves as a form of protection in dangerous neighbourhoods.

'They just feel safe having a weapon in their possession,' Inspector Charles Mc-Evoy, executive officer of the School Safety Division.

The use of metal detectors in schools has long been a source of controversy.

Critics argue that strict disciplinary practices, including police presence, metal detectors and 'zero tolerance' policies criminalize students, making them less likely to graduate and more likely to end up ensnared in the criminal justice system.

But advocates say they are necessary to keep children safe from each other as petty rivalries spawned within gang culture continue to blight many inner-city schools. 

'The things you find throughout the year, my God,' one Bronx high-school principal who wished to remain anonymous told the NYP. 'If you're pulling ten to 20 objects a week, that's ten to 20 possible injuries prevented.'

School-safety agents at DeWitt Clinton HS in The Bronx told The Post that many girls who carry weapons hide them in their bras, assuming the underwire will throw off the metal detectors. 

Another boy, they said hollowed out a school textbook in which to conceal a weapon.
