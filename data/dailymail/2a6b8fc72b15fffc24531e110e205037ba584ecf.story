The top 1 per cent of working-age households in Britain now take home 10 per cent of all income paid in the economy - compared to the 18 per cent taken by the bottom half, it emerged today.

The figures came in research by a think-tank that revealed the super-rich and bottom 50 per cent of working-age households in Britain shared the same proportion of income growth from 1994 to 2010.

But this split up when looking at 1994 to 2011, when 13 per cent of growth was claimed by the top 1 per cent, and 17 per cent by the poorest half of Britain - thanks in part to the 50p tax band launch.

Proportions: This Resolution Foundation diagram shows how the share of growth in working-age income dropped for the top 1 per cent in 2010-2011 to 10 per cent, after being 13 per cent for 1994-2011

The Resolution Foundation think-tank 
research’s starting point was 1994, with the top 1 per cent and bottom 
50 per cent each claiming 16 per cent of growth up to 2010, before the 
figure divided in 2011.

The 50p top tax rate on incomes above £150,000, brought in by Chancellor George Osborne in April 2010, saw a slide in the very richest’s earnings, but it will fall to 45p in April, reported the Observer.

While the poorest half of working-age households now receive just 18p of every £1 of income generated, down from 19p in 1994-95, the richest 10 per cent receive 33p of every £1, up from 29p.

The share of households which fall below the richest top 10 per cent but are above middle income - known as the upper middle income group - has fallen from 52 per cent to 49 per cent.

Wages went down in real terms across income groups during the recession years of 2008 to 2011.

Cash in hand: While the poorest half of working-age households now receive just 18p of every £1 of income generated, down from 19p in 1994-95, the richest 10 per cent receive 33p of every £1, up from 29p

But in the five years prior to the recession - 2003 to 2008 - the top 10 per cent of earners saw their gross wages continue to grow in real terms, from a full-time average of £75,980 to £79,650.

'The growing gap in incomes is pronounced when you look at the top 10th of households and overwhelming when you consider the position of the top one per cent.  The rest of society hasn’t kept up'

Matthew Whittaker, Resolution Foundation senior economist

Meanwhile the wages of typical workers stalled - and those of the least well-paid dropped from a pre-tax average £12,750 to £12,230.

Resolution Foundation senior economist Matthew Whittaker said: ‘Despite the recent dip in the fortunes of the top 1 per cent, if we take the longer view we see that the very wealthiest have continued to prosper while many others have not.  

‘The growing gap in incomes is pronounced when you look at the top 10th of households and overwhelming when you consider the position of the top one per cent. The rest of society hasn’t kept up.’

He added that Britain has become ‘a particularly difficult place for families below middle income who have to cope with flat wages, falling tax credits and rising prices’.

Bottom 50% receive 18p of £1, while top 10% take 33p, up from 29p in 1994

The top 1% and bottom 50% shared same income growth from 1994 to 2010

But top 1% had 13% and bottom 50% had 17% of growth from 1994 to 2011

The split in 2011 is thanks in part to the launch of Osborne's 50p tax band
