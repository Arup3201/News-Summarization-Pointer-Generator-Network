Portable pot vaporizers known as 'vapes' or 'pocket hookahs' are encouraging minors to smoke marijuana, critics have claimed, because they make it so easy to hide.

The products, which have boomed in recent years with the rise of electronic cigarettes, can look like nondescript writing pens, asthma inhalers or lip-gloss sticks or hang on gold neck chains.

But the fact they can be so well disguised is concerning groups who are worried about keeping legalized pot out of the hands of youths.

Discreet: Portable pot vaporizers known as 'vapes' or 'pocket hookahs' are encouraging minors to smoke marijuana, critics have claimed, because they make it so easy to hide

'This is incredibly concerning,' Colorado Tobacco Education and Prevention Alliance executive director Bob Doyle told the Denver Post.

'The
 marijuana vaporizing industry is as advanced or more advanced than the 
e-cigarette industry. The products are appealing to kids, and they 
promote the ability to hide marijuana use.'

The
 tiny electronic devices, which are charged with small wall plug-ins, 
were dubbed 'the iPod of getting baked' in the June issue of Rolling 
Stone magazine.

Marihuana users fill the chambers of the vaporizers with dried weed or with butter, waxes or oils processed from marijuana.

'There is serious potency in these,' said Doyle.

He added that high school students are sometimes even using the tiny, odorless devices on campus.

Thousands of brands have sprung up with questionable names such as Trippy Stix, Vapbong, E-Buzz. RemPen and Puffit-X.

Michael Mahaney, whose wife owns a store that sells vaporizers in Englewood, told the Denver Post that the devices were increasingly popular.

'They came on the market a couple years ago, and they've really picked up steam. It seems like everybody and their brother are selling these,' he said.

While they do not sell to minors, he acknowledged that young people were easily able to purchase the vaporizers online.

But Safer Alternative for Enjoyable Recreation co-founder Mason Tvert said it was 'absurd' to suggest the devices were encouraging kids to use pot.

'These products are not made, marketed or sold for kids,' Tvert told the newspaper.
