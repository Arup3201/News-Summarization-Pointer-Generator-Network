After five years of watching vehicles speed through his village at up to 98mph, Kevin McCarthy decided something had to be done.

Exasperated at the council’s failure to lower the speed limit or install a speed camera, he built a dummy camera on his land – and within a fortnight traffic speeds dropped.

But the same council has now told the father of four he could be blamed if drivers crash while trying to slow down to avoid being ‘flashed’ by the fake device.

Convincing: After the council refused a request to install a real speed camera in Ompton, Nottinghamshire, Kevin McCarthy spent £250 making his own

It has warned him he could be sued if anyone claimed they were ‘distracted or influenced by the “camera”.’

Mr McCarthy, 50, said: ‘I’ve been 
told if someone causes an accident by obeying the legal speed limit 
through the village, then it’s my fault. That’s madness.’ The interior 
designer, who had a welder friend make the £250 device out of scrap 
metal, said: ‘It’s just the job.’

Villagers in Ompton, Nottinghamshire,
have been campaigning for a 30mph speed limit ever since it was first 
cut from 60mph to 40mph six years ago.

Nottinghamshire County Council has 
refused on the grounds that the village – a scattering of around 20 
properties along the main Newark to Ollerton road – does not meet its 
criteria for the lower limit.

Reprimanded: Now the district council has told Mr McCarthy that he will be responsible for any accidents caused by the fake camera

Two temporary ‘interactive’ speed signs have been placed there since the limit was originally lowered.

Mr McCarthy said villagers had in the
past been on a police speed watch course, where they were taught how to
use a speed gun. ‘Once we caught somebody coming through the village at
98mph and we regularly have cars and bikes coming through at 60 to 
70mph.

‘You can tell when somebody’s sticking to the limit because they look so slow.

Fear: Mr McCarthy claims that getting out of his drive is like 'taking your life in your hands' while his wife Julie almost crashed into a lorry going 60mph

Not working: The speed limit through Ompton was cut from 60mph to 40mph six years ago, but attempts to get that lowered to 30 have failed

‘The speed of the traffic makes it 
extremely difficult to get out of my house and on to the main roads in 
the morning – most think nothing of doing 60 or 70mph.’

Matters came to a head recently when 
wife Julie, 52, who helps run their design business, was almost hit by a
speeding HGV as she turned out of their track.

Mr McCarthy added: ‘We have a problem with speeding through this village and it’s not going to be long before it kills someone.’

The council sent an official to see 
the ‘camera’, who asked him to remove it. But because the replica is on 
his own land, the authority is powerless to force him.

Mr McCarthy said the letter from Nottinghamshire County Council then arrived.

In it, the district highways manager 
wrote: ‘I fully appreciate your reluctance to remove the “camera”. 
However I must reiterate that if an accident occurred and anyone claimed
they were distracted or influenced by the “camera” I believe you would 
be liable for civil action.’

Councillor Richard Jackson, the 
county council’s cabinet member for transport and highways, said: ‘We 
agree that the camera is having an effect on reducing speed.

‘However, we do have concerns that, 
without the correct warning signs, it is a potential hazard as it is 
causing motorists to brake suddenly.’

He said speed cameras had to be 
properly positioned with correct warning signs, and added: ‘We fully 
understand the concerns of residents in Ompton... and we are hoping to 
put in a permanent interactive speed sign in the near future.’
