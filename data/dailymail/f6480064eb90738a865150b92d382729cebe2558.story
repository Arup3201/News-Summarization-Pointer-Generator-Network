Motorists on the M25 were brought to a standstill today after a lorry driver was killed in a horrific crash.

The man, who was aged in his fifties, was carrying a load of vodka when his vehicle collided with another lorry and caught fire.

A section of the motorway in Essex was closed while emergency services attended the scene, creating long tailbacks.

The road closure, between junctions 27 and 28, also caused long delays for drivers using other major routes connected to the motorway.

The crash happened at about 1am, half a mile west of junction 28 at Noak Hill.

The driver of the second vehicle suffered minor injuries.

Later, the anti-clockwise carriageway between the two junctions reopened, but the clockwise carriageway was closed for most of the morning.

To add to the disruption, the links to the M25 from junction 6 on the M11 were closed in both directions, with diversions in place.

Traffic information company Inrix said the accident led to delays on the M11, the A12 and the A406 North Circular in London.

The worst of the hold-ups were on the M11 and drivers were being advised to leave an hour extra for their journeys.
