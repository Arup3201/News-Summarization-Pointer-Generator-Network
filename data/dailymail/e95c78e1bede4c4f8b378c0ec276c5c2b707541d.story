They are part-motor home, part-coach ... and all style.

With 43 full-time drivers on NASCAR's elite Sprint Cup circuit and 36 races each season, it means lot of traveling across the country every year.

So in order to avoid constantly checking in-and-out of confined, expensive hotel rooms, many of the drivers have invested in a 'home away from home' on wheels.

They can also park them at the speedway. 

'This is where you spend all your weekends,' Darrell Waltrip , a NASCAR Hall of Fame driver, told The Orlando Sentinel. 

The motor homes cost anywhere from $1.2 million to more than $2 million.

Sleek: Many of the RV's are custom-built to tailor to the needs of the drivers and their families, who usually travel with them to competitions. here are 43 full-time NASCAR drivers and 36 races each season all over the country

'It's our home away from home': NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Darren Waltrip is one of many race men scooping up elaborate motor homes. He has been using motor homes since the 1980s, and recalls the days when he would park in among the fans 

Modern: The motor homes come equipped with state-of-the-art, luxury features, such as motel-style beds and temperature settings. The only problem can be the noise, since they are parked so close to the speedways where NASCAR stage their races

Impressive: The kitchens allow the drivers and their families to self-cater and not rely on restaurants while on the road, including elaborate fridges, freezes and other cooking appliances. Being able to cook eliminates having to rely on restaurants for the drivers and their families

Essentials: Even the bathrooms come with quality finishings, such as luxury showers with marble tiling and even a step. Some showers are a little more rudimentary than others, and like other motor homes are held up above the toilet

Comfortable: Usually the NASCAR stars hire a driver, who ferries the motor coaches around the country, or will captain the vehicle themselves. The drivers and their families are then able to fly ahead and meet the motor coach, rather than spend so much time on the road

Decadent: The RV's are built as 'homes away from home'. Seen here is an office-style study with a leather armchair. NASCAR drivers earn a salary of between $1 million to $20 million, not including endorsement deals

Relaxing: There are 36 races a season, meaning the driver's use the motor homes frequently, parking outside the speedways. A good couch is essential after a long day in a race car

State-of-the-art: The company that produces many of the motor homes, Featherlite Coaches, describes the finish as 'yacht-like'. They hail themselves the 'official NASCAR provider' when it comes to motor coaches

Classy: The RV's are built to be 'houses on wheels' and come complete with living rooms and even studies, like the one seen here

Luxury: The motor homes cost anywhere from $1.2 million to more than $2 million. Pre-owned vehicles start at around $200,000. Seen here is a smaller model, however fitted with the same luxury inclination, with white leather seats

Family-oriented: Older, pre-owned models sell for between $200,000 and $800,000. Seen here is a diner-style booth for meals and for sitting while traveling between races

Chauffeur: The NASCAR star's usually hire drivers to captain the vehicles so they can relax, fastening into comfortable chairs like these

Important: The motor homes are completely self-contained, built to be on the road for long periods. Some showers are less elaborate, like this one

Self-catered: The kitchens resemble those of a modest apartment, with finer details. This particular home has a Las Vegas-like hotel theme

Older, pre-owned models sell for between $200,000 and $800,000.

A NASCAR driver, generally, earns a yearly salary between $1 million and  $20 million, not including endorsements.

The motor homes are often custom-built to suit the requests of the driver's and their families, who usually travel with them, including features like baby rooms, plush carpeting and proper kitchens.

'During the season, I probably spend at least three days a week in my motor home,' NASCAR icon Richard Petty told The Sentinel.

'So it's not only my home away from home, it's my home.' 

Typically, the NASCAR drivers hire motor home drivers to ferry the RV's across the the country, while they fly ahead. 

A company called Fetherlite Coaches, which is based in Suffolk, Virginia, cater to many of the NASCAR drivers.

On their website they describe the finishings of the motor coaches as 'yacht-like'. 

They can feature up to four sliding rooms.   

Veteran: Driver Richard Petty (left) has been living in motor homes since the 1980s, starting with a simple caravan-style, and now upgrades every few years. He is seen here in 2002

At-home: The coaches are usually parked outside the speedways where the drivers will be racing, in what they call 'motor home row'

Child-friendly: Bunk beds are fairly standard sleeping arrangements, outside the master suite, with many having at least three. Driver David Ragan (right) owns a similar motor coach to the one seen here, which he travels in with his family

Novelty: The motor homes usually provide for space for children to play than a hotel room. It's not unusual for adults to sleep in the bunks, too

Practical: The kitchens could easily be mistaken for something from a regular apartment, with stove, fridge, microwave, oven and sizable sink

Spacious: The larger-sized motor homes can cost up to $2 million, but eradicate expensive hotels and flights. The master suites are quite spacious

Amenities: The motor coaches can fit even a large family of five, although typically only feature one bathroom to share

Beautiful: The newer motor homes have plenty of space and stunning finishings. Seen here is a model-style sink in the bathroom
