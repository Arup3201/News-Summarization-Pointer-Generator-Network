Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie and New York Red Bulls striker Bradley Wright-Phillips have faced off against each other in a rap battle.

The two players, who also squared off  back in February, mock each other in a pair of raps that will form a battle on the Lord of the Mics VI compilation CD, which features the biggest names in the UK grime scene.

Bolasie was first to go with his rap, and he pulls no punches as he lays into the former Charlton forward.

Bolasie says: 'He couldn't score goals in the Championship, that's why he went down to League One.

'All those years playing in England, everyone knows you be missing. 

'Even your own girl said you were scary,' he continues.  

The Palace winger also champions his own credentials and reminds Wright-Phillips that, 'I play in the Prem you know.' 

Yannick Bolasie went first in the rap battle and mocked Bradley Wright-Phillips for his goalscoring record

Wright-Phillips responded, and insisted he was the better rapper as the two went head-to head

Wright-Phillips responded in kind and insisted he was the better rapper: 'If you're being honest you know I've won, it's Brad keeping you in a battle that's done,' the striker said.

He also said of the Congolese international's scoring record, 'no goals, I feel so sorry for you.'

He added: 'MC battle? You were in a relegation battle.'

A close fight, but we think Bolasie just edges it.
