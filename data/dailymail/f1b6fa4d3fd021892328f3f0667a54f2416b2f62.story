A good Samaritan who was the victim of a sickening attack after she went to investigate screams coming from a park has described her ordeal.

Robyn Hannaway, 20, heard raised voices and feared a woman was being assaulted on her way home at night.

Miss Hannaway put her own safety to one side as she ran over to the unlit park area behind a garage in her hometown of Hamilton, Lanarkshire.

Victim: Miss Hamilton through she was coming to somebody's rescue when she was knocked out, stabbed, and had her purse stolen

But while she was looking for the victim, she was knocked out, her purse was taken and she had knife wounds to her face and stomach.

She was taken to Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride and Police Scotland have launched a hunt for the cowardly attacker.

In a Facebook post after the ordeal, Miss Hannaway warned others about her attacker's ploy.

She said: 'It makes me feel sick with worry knowing that whoever's responsible for attacking me is still on the streets, the weekend's coming up and I really want people to be aware and safe. I never want anyone to go through what me and my family have in past few days.

'I was walking through Burnbank to the BP Garage around 11.30 on Sunday night by myself (stupid I know).

'When I was walking past the park opposite the garage I heard a girl screaming, so I stopped to listen for a minute in case it was just a drunken argument I overheard.

'When I was sure there were no other voices except for one girl's, who sounded like she was in pain and distress, I ran into the park to help.

'Bearing in mind it was pitch black and I couldn't see anything/anyone, I could only hear that I was getting closer to her.

'As I got further into the park the girl went silent and within a few seconds I was completely knocked out by a man hitting me on the back of the head with something.

'By the time I woke up my purse was taken and while I was unconscious I was stabbed in the stomach and my face was slashed.'

'It's surreal to write, 'cause I can't believe someone so close to home where I've lived and felt safe all my life, has it in them to walk away and leave me lying there knowing there was a high chance they'd just killed me.

'I don't understand how anyone can have so much hatred for someone they don't know.

'They didn't care that they could have left my mum and dad without their youngest daughter, left my big sister without her only sister and left my family broken and devastated.

'Please be safe and don't let this happen to anyone again.'

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'We can confirm that Police Scotland detectives at Cambuslang CID are conducting enquiries into a serious assault and theft in the Burnbank area of Hamilton.

'The 20-year-old female victim was taken to Hairmyres Hospital for treatment for her injuries and was released.

'Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Constable Dan Pulfrey on 101.'
