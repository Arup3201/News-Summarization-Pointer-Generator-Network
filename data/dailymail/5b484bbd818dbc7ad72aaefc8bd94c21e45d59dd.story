Asking radio shock jock Ray Hadley about his private life live on air is a surefire way to abruptly end an interview, Karl Stefanovic discovered on Tuesday morning.

The Today Show host asked radio presenter Hadley if he was 'seeing anyone' in a planned interview shortly before 7am this morning.

After accusing Stefanovic of 'perpetuating myths' Hadley pulled out his earpiece and got up to walk off the set. The cameras then cut back to Stefanovic.

2GB radio host Ray Hadley ended an interview with Karl Stefanovic on the Today show on Tuesday morning after the host quizzed him about his love life

The tantrum appeared to be in some good humor but Hadley branded Stefanovic a 'complete idiot'

The interview was already tense, after Hadley took a swipe at the program asking if a segment on the plans of Mosman Council to allow parking police to fine speeding driver was really news.

Later when discussing rules for the use of drones in Darwin, Hadley called Stefanovic 'irresponsible' for allowing his children to play with one.

But it was the point when Stefanovic asked about Hadley's personal life that really tipped the balance.

'Any private conversation we may have, you can't keep to yourself,' Hadley told Stefanovic, somewhat jokingly.

'There was a report last week that I was dating Delta Goodrem's mum.' To which Stefanovic replied 'I heard you two were on.'

'I've never been to breakfast with her. Stop trying to perpetuate myths that have no basis in truth,' Hadley hit back.

He also told Stefanovic that he ran into Delta's mum in the dry cleaners where they were both separately dropping off clothes, and the pair were housemates over 30 years ago.

The host barely managed to control his laughter as Hadley flew off the handle about accusations he was dating Delta Goodrem's mum

Hadley then took his earpiece out and microphone off, called Stefanovic a complete idiot, although the whole exchange appeared to be in good humour.

The Today host couldn't contain his laughter as he dubbed Hadley's reaction a 'Clive Palmer style walkout.'

Hadley split from his wife Suzanne in 2011 and hit out media after their split came under scrutiny earlier this year

Hadley and his wife Suzanne were married for 20 years when they announced their separation in 2011.

In February this year the couple asked for privacy after Suzanne applied for and then withdrew AVOs against Hadley and his son, Daniel.

Then in May, Hadley lashed out at rival media outlets accusing them of meddling in his life after there was coverage of the radio host's split from his wife.

This came after NSW State of Origin assistant coach Matt Parish denied having an affair with Suzanne Hadley, who he says he met only after she separated from the broadcaster.

Hadley used his own radio show to address the issue, which played out earlier in the year after accusations he tried to have a football coach sacked because of his relationship with Hadley's estranged wife.

'Now you keep meddling in people's lives, maybe one day I'll start to meddle in your private life,' Hadley said on his show in mid-May in a broadcast directed at Sydney media.

On the same day John Singelton, owner of 2GB, made a rare appearance on air during Hadley's show defending the shock jock and making light of the media coverage.

Just days earlier Hadley had spoken out about his split from wife Suzanne for the first time, describing it as his 'biggest personal challenge'.

Earlier this year Hadley accused those covering stories of his ex-wife's alleged affair with NSW State of Origin assistant coach as 'meddling' in his life

'I've never been one to be overwhelmed by things, but this year has provided me with no doubt my biggest personal challenge,' Mr Hadley said.

'At times I've felt like staying in bed and not coming here [to work].

'Listeners have to understand that despite the fact I'm on the wireless I face exactly the same problems off air as you do every day.'

Hadley, who leads rugby league talkback show Continuous Call Team, used his 9am to midday slot on 2GB radio station to discuss the Blues, Daley and Trodden three in that same week.
