The bridal shop in Ohio where a nurse shopped right before she came down with Ebola is having a blowout sale to make up for the three weeks they spent sanitizing the space and scaring potential customers.

The Coming Attractions Bridal Shop in Akron was open on Tuesday at 11 a.m. after taking all the measures required to ensure that it was Ebola free after nurse Amber Vinson looked for bridesmaids dresses there there right before falling ill.

The store's owner Anna Younker told Cleveland.com that Vinson didn't even try on dresses there, only her bridesmaids did.

Didn't try on dresses:  The store's owner Anna Younker said that Vinson didn't even try on dresses there, only her bridesmaids did but people feared shopping there nonetheless

Younker put all of the items in the store on sale so that she could win back customers following widespread panic, she told ABC.

'It was totally blown out of proportion,' Younker said. 

'When I talked with the CDC and the health department, they said the fear people had of not knowing what was going on was similar to AIDS.'

Younker said that one customer returned a $2,000 dress because she feared her guests at the wedding would be too afraid to hug her if she wore it.

Someone even called the store to see if someone had died of Ebola there.

'We'll see if it sticks in people's heads,' Younker said. 

'As long as there are people here trying on merchandise and buying it, then they'll support the store.'

Ebola free: Workers in hazmat suits cleaned the store to make sure it was Ebola free for future shoppers 

All dressed in white: Cleaners in hazmat suits matched the white bridal dresses lined throughout the store 

One such Customer was Courtney Jones who says she doesn't fear getting Ebola from shopping at the store.

'I don't think there is anything to be afraid of,' said Jones.

Younker is marking down her items by 60 per cent and so far it's worked to lure a steady intake of shoppers

'I've never had a 60 percent off sale, ' said Younker.

The store's website tells potential customers that all their 'dream dresses' are on sale, not just a few.

'We have a beautiful showroom in Akron that sets the standard of service by offering a relaxed atmosphere where our customers can feel confident in choosing the bridal gown of their dreams. We feature bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses as well as a beautiful selection of ball gowns and party dresses for all occasions,' says the site.

The Facebook event states that 21 guests attended the store's re-opening.

Vinson was declared Ebola free on October 28.

'I am so grateful to be well,' Vinson said at an afternoon news conference where her discharge was announced.
