For more than ten years it has proved an essential part of Google's search engine.

But now it seems the technology giant is ditching its trademark 'I'm Feeling Lucky' button.

Google is currently testing out a new user interface design in Finland and the button is conspicuous by its absence.

No more 'I'm Feeling Lucky'? Google is currently testing out a new user interface design in Finland - and the button is conspicuous by its absence

'I'm Feeling Lucky' was designed to take users directly to the first search result, bypassing the search results page.

There has been no official word yet confirming whether or not it will be permanently removed.

But since the launch of the Google Instant search last year, the button only works if the user first disables the instant search fuction.

'I'm Feeling Lucky' was first created to reflect Google's confidence that its top search result would almost always be the one being looked for.

As Google continues to break new ground at a tremendous rate, perhaps the button is part of an older online mindset.

Earlier today it was confirmed that the company has struck a deal with the British Library to put 250,000 books online.

The works, which are all out of copyright, date from between 1700 and 1870 and have been selected by the library to be digitised by search engine giant.

The material - some 40million pages - will cover the period that saw the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the Battle of Trafalgar, the Crimean War, the invention of rail travel and the and of slavery.

And last week Google unveiled a new feature allowing users to conduct Internet searches searches on their personal computers simply with the sound of their voice and without touching a keyboard.

Google voice search has been available for some time on mobile devices, but now everyone will have the option of searching via voice command from a regular laptop or desktop.

The only thing needed is a microphone (either plugged in or internal will do) and Google Chrome.
