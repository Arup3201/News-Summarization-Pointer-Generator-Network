More women than men will be working beyond the age of 65 by 2020, experts predict.

This is because more women are in jobs than ever, they have a longer life expectancy than men and often, smaller pensions.

In
 six years, 37 per cent of women in their mid to late sixties will be 
working, outstripping men for the first time.

More women than men will be working beyond the age of 65 by 2020, experts predict. This is because more women are in jobs than ever, they have a longer life expectancy than men and often, smaller pensions

Only a third of men that 
age will be in a job, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says today.

In 
2000, just 8 per cent of women aged 65 to 69 had a job.

Pensions expert Ros Altmann, a former Downing Street adviser, said it showed Britain was ‘on the cusp of a social revolution’.

She
 said: ‘Women are living longer than ever before. Many are working 
because they have not got a pension.

But many are doing it because they 
want to.’

Older women who 
work often do so part-time and say they like the social interaction as 
well as the flexibility that many jobs  now allow.

The number who are  
working is partly fuelled by  the Government’s decision to increase the 
state pension age.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb said the era when people ‘shuffled off with a gold watch at retirement’, typically at 60, is over.

Neil
 Duncan-Jordan, of the National Pensioners’ Convention, fears women will
 usually be in low-paid jobs. He said: ‘There is one fact of life – if 
you are low paid, you will get a poor pension.

‘The only way many women can survive in later life is to work.’
