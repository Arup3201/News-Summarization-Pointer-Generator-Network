A Brazilian court is set to decide on the future of the 2016 Olympic golf course amid allegations the design is breaking environmental laws.

The plan is for the course in Rio de Janeiro to be carved out of a nature reserve with luxury high-rise apartments planned around the edges.

The city of Rio de Janeiro and the course developer are defendants in a lawsuit that alleges environmental laws were broken in authorising and building the layout.

Earlier this month, Rio judge Eduardo Klausner gave them until Wednesday to say if the course design can be modified to offer concessions to environmentalists.

Golf's return to the Olympics after 112 years is a centerpiece of the Rio Games. 

But the course has been plagued by legal challenges over land ownership, questions about the impact on a local ecosystem, and other delays.
