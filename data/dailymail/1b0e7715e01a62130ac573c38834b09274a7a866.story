Bookies reckon Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert should be looking over his shoulder after his new No 2, Roy Keane, was installed as favourite to be the club's next permanent boss.

Keane will join forces with Lambert while continuing to work as assistant to Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill.

Former Sunderland and Ipswich manager Keane linked up with O'Neill in November and is now returning to club football at Villa Park.

Villa players return for pre-season on Monday and will be expected to achieve a higher finish than the 15th place they managed last year.

Club man: Roy Keane returns to the Premier League as No 2 to Paul Lambert at Aston Villa

Hot seat: Lambert has been Aston Villa manager since June 2012 but had a disappointing last season

13/5 Roy Keane,Â  4/1 David Moyes, Jurgen Klinsmann, 6/1 Roberto Di Matteo, 10/1 Malky Mackay, 12/1 Tim Sherwood, 14/1 Neil Lennon, 20/1 Michael Laudrup

Lambert's future was in doubt as they flirted with the relegation places for much of the campaign and David Moyes, sacked by Manchester United with four games left, was favourite to replace his fellow Scot.

But Paddy Power now have Keane at 13/5 with Moyes and USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann next in the market at 4/1.

Lambert, who had his coaching staff significantly depleted last season when assistant Ian Culverhouse and football operations manager Gary Karsa were suspended and then sacked for unspecified disciplinary reasons, has welcomed Keane to the Midlands.

He said: ''Roy has a great knowledge of football, on the coaching side as well, and he'll be a great asset and a big help to everybody here at Aston Villa Football Club.

'I'm really looking forward to working with him and I'm delighted that he's here.

Two jobs: Keane will continue to work with Martin O'Neill in the Republic of Ireland set-up

'As a player, he was one of the most accomplished in the history of the Barclays Premier League and he's brought that experience gained over many years into his career in coaching and management. The players will love working with him.

'Although we never played together, we competed against one another and he's someone for whom I have a lot of time and respect. He has worked under some great managers, some of the most successful in the game, and he'll be a great help to myself as well.

'Roy brought Sunderland up out of the Championship and into the Premier League, he gained further experience at Ipswich - where we were close rivals while I was manager at Norwich - and he's now working at international level as assistant manager with the Republic of Ireland.

'All of that experience and knowledge along with the qualities he has as a longstanding, leading professional in the game means he will bring a lot to the table. We're delighted to have him here.'
