How would the Earth fare if it was pitted against other planets in a game of marbles?

The scale of the universe in terms of size is mind-bending enough – but considering the mass of planets can provide a new perspective.

This animation, created by a former astronomer, reveals the comparative masses of planets in the solar system as they cascade down onto Earth.

It shows how, while Earth is four times larger than the moon, it is 87 times more massive.

Mars is half the size of Earth and has a mass ten times smaller. Mercury, meanwhile is just over a third as large as our planet, but is 18 times less massive.

The visualisation was created by Prague-based astronomer Rhys Taylor for his ‘Physicists formerly of the Caribbean’ blog.

‘Mercury isn't much to look at, but it's almost as hot as Venus and colder than Mars, constantly,’ Mr Taylor writes.

‘It has no atmosphere to spread the heat around, so the side facing the sun is roasting hot and the other side would make a taunton wish for thermal underwear.’

Mercury's high density could be because it's the core of a larger planet, with the lighter material having been blasted into space by a collision billions of years ago. 

Venus is about the same mass as Earth.

Earth is twice the size of Mars and about nine times more massive.

Mecury is just over a third as large as Earth and 18 times less massive.

The moon is a quarter the size of Earth and 82 times less massive.

Pluto is slightly smaller than the moon, but the Earth is 460 times as massive.

Earth has a mass over 6,000 times greater than Ceres.

It’s the lightest planet in our solar system, making anything there a third of the weight it is on Earth.

That’s because its mass is much smaller than that of Earth’s and its gravity is a third of our planets.

Ceres is the largest asteroid, with a diameter the same as the length of the UK.

Earth has a mass over 6,000 times greater than Ceres.

This is an unfair battle, however, as Earth always wins in these comparisons with only smaller worlds being featured.

To see how Earth battles it out with larger bodies such as the sun, Mr Taylor has created another video called ‘Blue Marbles’.
