They are natural phenomenons, enchanting many with their dazzling colours and capturing imaginations with tales of leprechauns and pots of gold.

However, any romantic notions about how rainbows are created have been blown out of the water - by a woman brandishing a shotgun.

A video viral called 'Kirsti's Shotgun Rainbow' features a gun-toting lady from American's southern states creating a rainbow with a firearm.

How to create a rainbow: 'Kirsti' shows us how it's done with a mini tutorial posted on YouTube

Under fire: She sprays shells into the water - and the first signs of a rainbow become visible

Wearing jeans, a shirt and sunglasses - with her hair pulled back into a sensible ponytail - 'Kirsti' demonstrates what can happen when nature and weapons collide.

Looking at the camera, she asks: 'Hey y'all. Have you ever seen anybody make a rainbow with a 12-guage shotgun?'.

Seemingly unconcerned about the potential environmental hazards, she then fires eight shots into the water.

As the shells are fired into the stream, a colourful rainbow glare rises above the water.

'Kirsti' stands back and admires her handiwork... but critics have chastised her for her lack of concern for the environment

'Kirsti' then looks at the camera and ends her video clip, signing off with the phrase: 'Well, now you have.'

Reaction to the video is varied, with some marvelling at the spectacle.

Others, however, were more critical with one YouTube user saying: 'You're shooting the fish.'

Another user posted: 'Great, now you've poisoned our only water supply with lead. What next? shooting our canned food for target practice?'
