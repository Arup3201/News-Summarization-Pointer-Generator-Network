It was the proud day the dwindling band of heroes had waited seven decades to see.

Veterans of the Arctic Convoys who risked their lives on what Churchill called ‘the worst journey in the world’ finally received proper recognition yesterday.

The survivors – now in their 80s and 90s – were honoured with Arctic Star medals and an admission from David Cameron that he was ‘righting a wrong’.

The presentation was a victory for the Daily Mail’s campaign to have the  medals struck.

More than 3,000 Royal Navy and 
merchant seamen died between 1941 and 1945 on the convoys. Only about 
200 veterans are still alive.

The very first Arctic Star was awarded
 to Commander Eddie Grenfell, 93, who has battled tirelessly for 16 
years for the convoy heroes to be recognised.

He received his award from General Sir
 David Richards, the head of the Armed Forces, at a special ceremony in 
his home city of Portsmouth because of illness.

Cdr Grenfell, released from hospital 
three weeks ago after suffering a heart attack, was too poorly to attend
 the main ceremony with 41 comrades in London.

Heroes: Pictured in their youths are Former Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander Roy Dykes, (left) who served on 16 arctic convoy missions, surviving on a daily diet of a single piece of bread and corned beef, and Jock Dempster, one of the leading veterans in the campaign to award the Arctic Convoy seamen a medal

But he received a letter of 
congratulations from the Prime Minister, who announced in December that 
the Arctic Star would be awarded, along with the new Bomber Command 
Clasp.

It praised Cdr Grenfell’s campaign  and the ‘extraordinary bravery and fortitude of a very special group of men’.

Victory for campaign: The Mail in December last year

Cdr Grenfell, who survived ten minutes
 in the icy Arctic waters before he was rescued after his ship SS Empire
 Lawrence was bombed in May 1942, said: ‘It is absolutely wonderful. We 
deserve this but it has been a frustrating battle against bureaucratic 
injustice.

‘It is sad that so many of my comrades are not alive today to receive their medals.’

Sir David, the Chief of the Defence 
Staff, asked to personally present Cdr Grenfell’s medal ‘on behalf of 
the nation’.

He said: ‘It’s a very, very special day for all of us in 
the Armed Forces, but especially for a small group who are still with us
 who did some very special things way back in the Second World War.

‘It’s hard to comprehend what you and your comrades did battling against an enemy intent on your destruction.

‘What Eddie and his comrades did was 
to ensure Russia could stay in the war at a very, very difficult time. 
If they had been beaten by the Nazis then probably we would have been 
beaten.

‘So a small group of people played a 
vital role in something as massive as winning the war.’ The Arctic 
Convoys were perilous missions to keep Russian supply lines open.

The convoys carried four million tons 
of cargo including tanks, planes, fuel and food to slow  Germany’s 
advances on the Eastern front.

Arctic Star: Around 40 veterans were included in the first group to receive the newly-created medal

More than 66,000 Royal Navy sailors 
and merchant seamen took part. In total, 87 merchant ships and 18 
British warships were sunk.

But the Cold War meant it was 
politically difficult to give the  survivors a medal for assisting  the 
Soviet Union and it is only now that the Arctic Convoy  veterans have 
been properly  recognised.

Mr Cameron ordered the medals amid concerns 
many veterans would die before they were awarded.

Hosting a special ceremony in Downing 
Street, he told the survivors: ‘I am only sorry that it has taken 70 
years to get to here and to say thank you for what you did.

‘You were involved in the most 
important struggle of the last 100 years when you were supplying one of 
our allies in the battle to defeat Hitler and to defeat fascism in 
Europe.

'You are a group of heroes.’ The Prime Minister also joined three
 Arctic Convoy veterans for  a tour of HMS Belfast, one of  the ships 
which took part in  the mission.

Afterwards, veteran Frank Bond, 89, 
from Eltham, south east London, said: ‘It’s the culmination of 72 years 
since I first went on the Russian convoy, to recognise not what I did 
but what the sailors who gave their lives did.

‘I am not a hero, I am a survivor but the guys who went up there they really had it rough and a lot of them didn’t come back.’

Arctic convoys: The seamen travelled what Winston Churchill dubbed the 'worst journey in the world'

The leading figure behind the campaign to award the Arctic Star medal today had his award presented at a special ceremony because he was too ill to travel to the main presentation in London.

Commander Eddie Grenfell, now 93, has lobbied tirelessly for 16 years for the medal to be created and was the first veteran to receive the star.

After the decision was made last December to award the star, the Government was urged to act quickly because of the advancing age and ill-health of Cdr Grenfell as well as other veterans.

Cdr Grenfell was only released from hospital three weeks ago where he had been since last October.

He has suffered a heart attack and two cardiac arrests but managed to build up enough strength to attend today’s ceremony.

The Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards attended the special event at the Mayor’s Parlour at Portsmouth Guildhall, Hampshire, to award Cdr Grenfell.

The head of the UK armed forces had personally requested to attend the event to recognise Cdr Grenfell’s lobbying efforts as well as his service on four of the Arctic convoys to Russia.

Cdr Grenfell arrived in a wheelchair supported by his family at the presentation.

Cdr Grenfell’s campaign, supported by the Portsmouth News, gained massive popular support with a petition of 42,000 signatures being handed to Downing Street in 2004 as well as gaining support from local MPs.

Sir David said: ‘It’s a very, very special day for all of us in the armed forces but especially for a small group who are still with us who did some very special things way back in the Second World War.

‘We are here to celebrate the extraordinary bravery and fortitude of that very special group of men.’

He continued: ‘It’s hard to comprehend 
what you and your comrades did battling against an enemy intent on your 
destruction. It’s thoroughly humbling and we are all in awe of what you 
achieved.’

And praising Cdr Grenfell’s medal 
campaign, he said: ‘It was a conspicuous campaign in the way it was 
conducted with great dignity.’

Get well soon: Cdr Grenfell received a letter from the Prime Minister wishing him a 'speedy recovery'

He added: ‘I am delighted both personally and professionally to be here to present the very first Arctic Star on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, the armed forces and, may I say, the entire nation.’

Cdr Grenfell said he felt wonderful to be finally receiving the medal.

He said: ‘If I were to mention the names of all the good people who have helped me and my deputy Lt Cdr Dick Dykes to win our 16-year long battle against bureaucratic injustice, our visitors would have to extend their stay in our beautiful city, Portsmouth.

‘I am, however, not so churlish to ignore the part played by our prime minister David Cameron in achieving today’s success.

‘He has, as I hear, always supported our claim for the award of the British Arctic Star but was hampered by bureaucracy, just as I was.

‘It is just sad that so many of my comrades are no longer with us to receive their medals today.’

He also thanked the Portsmouth News for supporting the campaign.

His daughter, Trudie Grenfell, 65, said: ‘It’s an ecstatic, exciting, amazing day. He can finally put this to rest now after 16 years of hard work where he has sat up night after night at his computer fighting for all of them. I honestly didn’t think it would happen.

‘He’s in ill-health, he has only been out of hospital for three weeks now, he had been in since last October and there were two weeks when we thought he wouldn’t make it.

‘He had two cardiac arrests where they brought him back to life and then there was the heart attack. He certainly is a fighter and I do not think he’s stopped grinning since he got that thing (Arctic Star) in his hand.’

Cdr Grenfell was born in Montrose, Scotland, but left at the age of 16 when he joined the Royal Navy and made Portsmouth his home.
