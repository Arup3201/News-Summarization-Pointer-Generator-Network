The family of a young father who is missing with his infant on today claimed that it is not the first time he has taken the child on his own.

Kieran Carroll, 22, of Luton, Bedfordshire, has 'left' with his eight-month-old son Louis before, a source close to his family told MailOnline this afternoon.

It comes as police renewed their appeal for Mr Carroll to get in contact after he posted two messages on Facebook saying both he and his son were 'fine'.

Taunt: This comment, posted in response to a police appeal, is believed to have come from one of three accounts belonging to Mr Carroll. Police said they are now trying to verify the message

In response: Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post yesterday afternoon (seen above)

Speaking today, the family source told MailOnline that they did not know what had 'gone on' but said 'it isn't the first he's left with his son.'

The source added that they knew both father and son were 'fine'. It is understood the child was in his father's care at the time they were last seen.

It is understood that Mr Carroll attended Bedford College, Bedfordshire, and formerly lived with his girlfriend, Louis' mother, at a home in Luton.

The 20-year-old woman is believed to have a three-year-old son from a previous relationship.

Yesterday afternoon, police searching for Mr Carroll released CCTV footage showing him pushing a pram as he left a hotel in the town at about 2pm. He has not been seen since. 

When the image was shared on Facebook by Bedfordshire Police, a profile understood to belong to Mr Carroll posted: 'I’m fine, so is my child - go look for some killers'.

The force also published a photo of Louis on Facebook, along with new details on the search. The taunting response came from one of three accounts believed to belong to Mr Carroll, police said.

Later last night, the same 'Kieran Carroll' profile commented again, saying, 'If any one is commenting and don't no me or what's really going on... stay out of my life you don't no me.'

Concerns: Bedfordshire Police also released this photograph of baby Louis, whom they are trying to trace

Detective Inspector Quinn replied to the Facebook post yesterday afternoon, saying: 'Kieran – Thank you for posting on our Facebook page.

‘We are pleased to hear that you and Louis are safe. It is not the role of the police to decide on child custody matters.

The baby's great-grandmother today appealed for Mr Carroll to bring Louis back home safely.

Vivien Jakob-Grant, 65, told ITV Anglia: 'I would rather Louis be back home where he should be. I want him to be back home in one piece.

'I don't think his father would have hurt him because he doesn't look the kind of person who would do that - but I want him to be back home.

'I would just like him to take Louis back home where he should be.'

‘All we need to do is see you and Louis in person to check you are safe and well. Please call us on 101 so we can arrange to meet you. We cannot close this case until we see you.' 

Police are now trying to verify the Facebook comments believed to have been posted by Mr Carroll. 

Today, officers renewed their appeal, asking Mr Carroll to contact them directly.

Detective Inspector Sean Quinn said this afternoon: 'We don’t believe that there are any issues with Kieran providing care for Louis but we do still need Kieran to get in touch with us. 

'He is not in any trouble for taking Louis but I would still like to speak to him. We cannot close the case until the police have seen Louis.

'Louis’s mother is understandably worried and missing her son so again I’d urge Kieran, or anyone who knows where Kieran is, to call us on 101.'

The posts on the Bedfordshire Police Facebook page prompted a number of comments from Mr Carroll's friends and family, defending his actions.   

Search: Fears are growing because police say the disappearance of Mr Carroll (above) is ‘completely out of character’, and because they believe he does not have any supplies for the baby

One commenter on the Facebook page, Chantelle Louise White, said: ‘You lot make out that he ant fine I know him for years and he won't do nuttin to he's son… He's looked after my son when he was the sane age! [sic]’

And Mr Carroll's sister, Alix Carroll, 24, said: 'My brother is an amazing father - he has his boy more than the mother does. 

A close friend of Mr Carroll last night claimed the father and Louis were ‘safe’. 

She said he was not planning to contact police 'yet' because he does not want to lose contact with Louis.

Speaking last night, the woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I just spoke to him on the phone and I heard his child giggling in the background. 

'He is just trying to do the right thing but he has done it the wrong way. I have told him that. He is trying to take back his child from his mother. 

'Kieran is doing the right thing by taking the child out of this situation and he is not going to the police just yet. I am trying to convince him but I can't force him to do it. 

'He can't bear the fact that tomorrow he won't be able to see his child again because social services will get involved.’

'He's scared he's going to lose him - it's no different to if it was the other way round.

'Never in a million years would he harm a hair on his body. He will be safe - I bet my life on it.'

Posting on Facebook, she added that she didn't know where her brother was, but that 'Louie is safe and there both okay [sic].' 

Earlier, police described the father’s disappearance as ‘completely out of character’ and said there are concerns because they believe Mr Carroll does not have any supplies for the baby.

Mr Quinn said: 'This type of disappearance is very out of character for Kieran and we are becoming increasingly concerned. 

'We just want Kieran to contact us to let us know that him and Louis are safe. 

'If you have seen Kieran, or have any information about where he and Louis may be, please contact us immediately.'

Mr Carroll is described as a white man of medium build, with short brown hair. 

He is believed to be wearing black trousers, and a grey hooded top, a bobble hat, as seen in the CCTV image.

He also has tattoos on his arms. The security image shows Mr Carroll pushing a pram, but police said he later disposed of the pram at a friend's house and left carrying his son in his arms.

The baby boy is believed to be wearing a blue cardigan with a picture of a ship on it. Searches for the young father are concentrating on the local area around his home of Luton.

Anyone who may have seen Mr Carroll and his son, or has any information on their whereabouts, is urged to contact Mr Quinn on 101.
