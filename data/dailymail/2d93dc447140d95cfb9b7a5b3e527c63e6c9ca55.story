How? Mother Firuza Gainiyeva, 44, questioned how her daughter and her boyfriend were allowed to leave Britain

Two teenage runaways who fled their top British public school to go on a Caribbean holiday were effectively expelled by the headmaster yesterday and told not to return.

Indira Gainiyeva, 17, and Edward Bunyan, 16, will not be returning to the prestigious £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, after their parents travelled to  the Dominican Republic to bring them home.

Andrew Johnson, headmaster of Stonyhurst, a Jesuit Catholic school, is understood to have asked the parents to remove their children from the school with immediate effect.

He said another Jesuit boarding school had offered the pupils an interview to give them ‘a last chance to make a success of their sixth-form education’.

The decision came as Indira’s mother Firuza, 44, blamed Britain – as well as young love – for her daughter’s disappearance.

Speaking from the family mansion in Kyzylorda, Kazakhstan, she said: ‘There are many shades in this story. For example, how did she manage to leave the country? How did Britain let them go at their age? Why did this other country let them in?

‘I think it was both love and a  strict school,’ she added. ‘They ran away, then they got scared, they  are children. Thank God, they can go back to studying. They will get on with their education.

‘I only thank God she is alive and healthy. And I thank God she will be back at school.’

The young couple fled from the 400-year-old Roman Catholic boarding school in Clitheroe in the early hours of January 13, after telling friends they wanted to escape from the rain.

They took a taxi to Manchester airport and boarded a plane to the Dominican Republic, where they were found, a week later, staying in an apartment in the resort of Punta Cana.

Indira’s father Ravil and Edward’s mother Susannah flew out to be with them and they are all now staying in a five-star all-inclusive resort. The families are expected to fly back within the next few days.

In Punta Cana yesterday, Mrs Bunyan declined to comment but Mr Gainiyev was pictured trying to reason with his daughter, who was clearly upset.

A relative of Indira said that the girl feared having to return to conservative Kazakhstan after an internet backlash in her home country.

The relative said: ‘She told her father, “How can I go back to school, and how can I live anywhere now? I face shame and disgrace. I cannot live calmly in Kazakhstan, everyone will point a finger at me”.’

An official statement released yesterday by Stonyhurst said that Edward and Indira’s parents withdrew their children from the school after long-distance phone discussions with the head about the repercussions of their children’s behaviour.

But The Mail on Sunday understands that decision was made after Mr Johnson made it clear to all parties that the pupils’ continued position at Stonyhurst was untenable.

A school insider said: ‘Although they have not been formally expelled, the effect is exactly the same – they won’t be returning  to Stonyhurst. Both pupils have been withdrawn at the headmaster’s request.’

The Mail on Sunday understands that Edward and Indira have been offered interviews at £25,000-a-year boarding school Mount St Mary’s College near Sheffield.

Past pupils include Victorian  poet Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Lofting, who wrote the Doctor Dolittle books.

Mr Johnson said he helped to arrange the interviews after both pupils had given an account of  their behaviour to their parents,  and apologised.

‘I have spoken to the head there and as a result have secured interviews for both Edward and Indira  at the school. It is now up to them to take it forward,’ he said.

‘They have both said sorry for what they have done and for the distress they have caused and we wouldn’t want to leave them high and dry, no matter what they have done. They have been given a  last chance.’

Mr Johnson added: ‘In a way, what has happened has been a lesson to others who might be contemplating the same thing.

‘Pupils may have first thought that this was some kind of exciting adventure, but they soon saw all the trouble that Edward and Indira’s actions have caused.

‘They also saw that sooner or later they had to face the consequences of their actions, which have led to Edward and Indira being unable  to return to school.

‘All of a sudden it no longer looks like such a good idea. That in itself is a very powerful deterrent.’

A member of the Gainiyev family said yesterday that Indira’s wealthy father accepted that his daughter wanted to continue to study with Edward.

The relative said: ‘He now wants  to see her at this new school with Eddy, and that both of them can do as well as possible so they can go  on to good universities.’
