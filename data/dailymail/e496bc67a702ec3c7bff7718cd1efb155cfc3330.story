It's not the traditional way to ride a rollercoaster.

But this daredevil had the thrill of his life when he took on Mexico's enormous wooden ride by motorbike.

Frenchman Julien Dupont, 34,  performed death-defying backflips and wheelies on the circuit of Mexico City's famous Montaña Rusa at La Feria de Chapultepec amusement park.

The rollercoaster is almost a mile long, and as well as working his way along its full length, Dupont used his skills and power to reach up to 110ft off the ground on a structure designed for a powerless train assisted only by gravity. 

'Now I feel better, for sure,' said an elated Dupont afterwards. 'This morning, I was very nervous because I'm not used to riding this kind of stuff. It was the sickest ride ever!'

Nerves didn't prevent the 34-year-old from performing two backflips on the towering structure, a landmark in the Mexican capital for almost 50 years and at one time the world's tallest rollercoaster.

'This is why I love Mexico, because this is the place where the impossible becomes possible,' added Dupont. 'There's no place in the world where I could do the same.'
