Celebrity businesswoman Baroness Karren Brady has joined the growing list of wealthy stars to declare an insistence their children must work to earn their own way through life.

Brady, who is the vice-chairman of West Ham United and a judge on the BBC television show The Apprentice, has revealed she encouraged her daughter Sophia to take up a Saturday job at a Solihull branch of Hollister's.

She said work place demands taught teenagers basic communication skills and developed their personality much further beyond just academic success.

It also taught them how to better interact with others, which spending too much time in front of computer and smartphone screens would not.

Following in the footsteps of the Beckhams, Kim Kardashian and Sting, Brady, 45, told the Sunday Times her daughter 'folded clothes, hoovered and worked on the till' during her Saturday shifts.

She said: 'It helped her realise there is a whole world outside school of different experiences and places.

'It helped her develop her personality, not just academic skills.'

Brady also revealed Sophia, who is now 18, and studying at university, is funding her studies and living expenses with a student loan - which Brady refuses to pay off.

Last year Brady told the Huffington Post her own first job was sweeping the floor at a hairdressers.

She said: 'My own career began when I joined a hairdressers to sweep the floor. It wasn't a job that on paper I wish for my daughter, though the skills I learnt there put me on the right path.' 

She joins a growing number of celebrities who have expressed a desire for their children to learn the value of hard work.

In May, it was revealed David and Victoria Beckham's son Brooklyn had taken up a job at a West London coffee shop where he was paid £2.68 an hour.

Due to his age, he couldn't work for more than seven hours on a Saturday and had to be given an hour’s break after four hours.

A member of staff, who did not want to be named, confirmed he had worked a few shifts and ‘got on OK’ with other baristas.

News of his decision to make his own money and not sponge off his wealthy parents earned him praise as a good role model for other teenagers.

Last year David Beckham said: ‘We try to lead by example, by showing them it’s important to work hard.

‘That’s one of the key things me and my wife have always done … We juggle everything around the family because our main priority is the children, simple as that, and it always will be, but being hardworking is the best thing you can show children.’
