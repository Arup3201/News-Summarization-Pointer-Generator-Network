Diego Costa's ability in front of goal will allow Eden Hazard to concentrate on providing assists rather than scoring goals, according to the man himself.

The Belgian, who netted 14 Premier League goals for Jose Mourinho's side last season, is delighted to be playing alongside £32million summer signing Costa as he believes the former Atletico Madrid striker takes a weight off his shoulders.

The Spain international has already scored four times since arriving from La Liga, including two goals in the 6-3 win over Everton at Goodison Park last time out.

Speaking about Costa and fellow new signing Cesc Fabregas to the London Evening Standard, Hazard said: 'It's true they're the best players. Costa can score every game and Cesc is one of the best midfielders in the world.

'Cesc can score as well and make good assists, just like the first game against Burnley where he made a beautiful pass for Andre Schurrle. It's very important for the team and he can help us win.

'Last season I scored a lot of goals and maybe this season I can make a lot more passes forward because Costa is one of the best and he can score. It's my job to score but it's also my job to make assists as well.'

The 23-year-old, who scored in the Blues' 2-0 home win against Leicester, has already created 10 chances this season, with a low cross against Roberto Martinez's side ending with Seamus Coleman putting the ball into his own net.

He added: 'I can now concentrate on assists. I'm ready to be better than last season. When I'm on the pitch I try to give my best.

'The new players have settled in very good. I enjoy playing with the best players in the squad and I'm very happy.'
