Toronto's gregarious mayor Rob Ford may yet regret being such a naughty boy.

One of the city's top fetish queens is planning on whipping its administration into shape by challenging Ford for the mayoralty.

Carlie Ritch - known to her clients as Mizz Barbie B**** - is a professional dominatrix and believes she can run Canada's most populous city better than the controversial incumbent.

Mayor Ford, you've been a very naughty boy: Professional dominatrix Carlie Ritch is to challenge Rob Ford in Toronto's upcoming mayoral elections after getting fed up with his 'arrogance and abuse of power'

Ms Ritch, a mother of two grown up children and grandmother of one, runs a busy Toronto dungeon and her plans to open a chain of dominatrix schools are being looked at by the angel investors of Dragon's Den

The 43-year-old says the confidence she has gained as a dominatrix has made her the perfect candidate to challenge Ford's 'arrogance and abuse of power'.

Ms Ritch, a mother of two grown up children and grandmother of one, runs a busy Toronto dungeon and her plans to open a chain of dominatrix schools are being looked at by the angel investors of Dragon's Den.

She even claims to have clients at City Hall, although she declines to name them.

With campaign slogans including 'I'll 
whip this city into shape' and 'I mean business', Ms Ritch says she is 
'a warrior' who will 'change things at City Hall.'

'If
 I get elected I'd clean house, councillors who've been there 30 years 
have got to go. Any bureaucrats not doing their job will be re-assigned 
or moved out,' she told the Toronto Sun.

And
 in case Toronto's citizens were worried that they might end up with 
another mayor hitting the front pages for all the wrong reasons, she 
insisted: 'I don’t have any skeletons in my closet.

'I AM the skeleton.'

'I AM the skeleton': The successful businesswoman even claims to have City Hall officials among her clients

Mayor Ford laughs in front of a 'Keep Calm and Carry On' sign at City Hall yesterday: After being elected on a Right-wing ticket in 2010, he has been under pressure to resign since admitting smoking crack last year

Ms Ritch doesn't think her career as a dominatrix should put people off her, claiming she is as normal as anyone else.

I'm a single mum and I've worked for everything I have. I'm really that blue-collar, normal, ordinary person,' she said.

Indeed, after the scandal-ridden tenture of crack-smoking incumbent Mayor Ford, even the candidacy of such a flamboyant character as Mizz Barbie Bitch might seem to Toronto's voters like a return to relative political normality.

The mayor has become notorious for his associations with alleged drug dealers, drunken outbursts and unpredictable behaviour - but has consistently dismissed calls for his resignation.

Controversial: Mayor Ford wades through a media scrum outside City Hall

Just yesterday Mayor ford fled journalists after Toronto's police released a detailed description of a video which shows him smoking the highly addictive cocaine derivative.

That embarrassment came just two days after the party-loving politician was filmed apparently drunk and swearing at passing cars during Toronto's St Patrick's Day celebrations.

In January he was filmed in a Toronto restaurant ranting obscenities in Jamaican patois.

After being elected on a Right-wing ticket in 2010, Mayor Ford has been under great pressure to resign since he admitted smoking crack last year.

Toronto's City Council stripped him of many of his powers but does not have the authority to remove him. Undaunted, he has vowed to run for re-election this autumn.
