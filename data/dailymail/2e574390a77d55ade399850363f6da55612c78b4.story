There may still be three months until the festive season arrives,
but one inventor has received an amazing early Christmas present from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office.

Ignacio Marc Asperas, of Melville, New York, has been
granted an astonishing patent for ‘facilitating the construction of a snowman/woman’,
five years after he first applied.

The inventor wrote a 25-page document with details on how to roll symmetrical
snow balls and construct body parts such as arms and shoulders - and he insists he is being absolutely serious.

'If you're like me, you enjoy building snow men big,’ Mr
Asperas wrote in the patent. ‘The bigger the better. One problem is there isn't
always someone around to help. It is very difficult by yourself.

Spherically-shaped body made with interior structure including outer surface

Adhesion surface on outer surface that increases ability to hold snow to body

Spherically-shaped body must be a strong building block for rest of snowman

Generator with electric charge coupled to outer surface for static to help snow stick

‘Over the years, I have developed different tricks to assist
my self-style of building snow people. My favourite trick is to use the long
end of a shovel as a lever to rotate the boulder when it is really big.’

He described the original inventor of the snowman as a ‘genius’,
but said he knows nothing about its history and had often had trouble with his
back when building up a snow boulder, reported Gawker and Huffington Post.

'I do not pretend that the ultimate snowman will be as
revolutionary to the advancement of mankind (as the wheel and the toaster oven),’
Mr Asperas wrote in U.S. patent 8,011,991 B2.

‘But I do contend that as far as I know no one has ever
conceived and reduced to practice such an apparatus.’

Design: He said he wants to create a snow boulder that is 'perfect every time' - symmetrical and lightweight

Top hat: Mr Asperas said some problems people come across when building snowmen are the boulder size, the amount of snow available, the stacking of each boulder and the positioning on the ground

Mr Asperas said some problems people come across when
building snowmen are the boulder size, the amount of snow available, the
stacking of each boulder and the positioning on the ground.

'We are living in the 21st century now,' he wrote. 'We have
created the internet. China is getting ready to send a person to the moon.

‘And we invented silly putty, perhaps one of the all-time
greatest inventions a big kid ever invented. Can't somebody build a better
snowman?'

Mr Asperas said he wants to create a snow boulder that is 'perfect
every time' - symmetrical and lightweight. The patent was first spotted by a number of technology websites, including Geek.com.
