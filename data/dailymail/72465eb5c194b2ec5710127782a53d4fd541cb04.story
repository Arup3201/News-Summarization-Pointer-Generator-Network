Juventus beat Palermo 2-0 Sunday to move three points clear at the top of Serie A and bring a disappointing week to a close.

Fernando Llorente scored his first goal of the season after Arturo Vidal had given the home side the lead.

Juventus moved three points clear of Roma, who were held to a draw by Sampdoria on Saturday. Defending champion Juventus had seen its advantage cut after dropping its first points of the season against Sassuolo.

Massimiliano Allegri's team endured further disappointment when it fell to a second successive Champions League defeat at Olympiakos.

Despite what coach Allegri admitted was a ‘poor’ first half, they were never under pressure.

‘We played a poor first half, we didn’t move the ball around quickly enough, but we certainly did much better in the second half,’ he told reporters.

Elsewhere, Genoa came back against 10-man Chievo Verona to ruin coach Rolando Maran's debut, and Udinese beat Atalanta 2-0.
