Hundreds of people black and white, many holding hands, filled an Alabama church that was bombed by the Ku Klux Klan 50 years ago on Sunday to mark the anniversary of the blast that killed four little girls and became a landmark moment in the civil rights struggle.

The Rev. Arthur Price taught the same Sunday school lesson that members of 16th Street Baptist Church heard the morning of the bombing - A Love That Forgives.

Then, the rusty old church bell was tolled four times as the girls' names were read.

Bombing survivor Sarah Collins 
Rudolph, who lost her right eye and sister Addie Mae Collins in the 
blast, stood by as members laid a wreath at the spot where the dynamite 
device was placed along an outside wall.

Rudolph
was 12 at the time, and her family left the church after the bombing. 
She said it was important to return in memory of her sister, who was 14,
and the three other girls who died: Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley
Morris, both 14, and Denise McNair, 11.

'God
spared me to live and tell just what happened on that day' said 
Rudolph, who testified against the Klansmen convicted years later in the
bombing.

Congregation 
members and visitors sang the old hymn Love Lifted Me and joined hands 
in prayer. The somber Sunday school lesson was followed by a raucous, 
packed worship service with gospel music and believers waving their 
hands.

During the sermon, 
the Rev. Julius Scruggs of Huntsville, president of the National Baptist
Convention USA, said: 'God said you may murder four little girls, but 
you won't murder the dream of justice and liberty for all.'

Churchgoers heard the same sermon as 50 years ago while they attended services at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham today

Later
Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder and others were set to attend a 
commemoration. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a Birmingham 
native who went to school with McNair, was among the scheduled speakers.

The
dynamite bomb went off outside the church September 15, 1963. Of the 
Klansmen convicted years later, one remains imprisoned. Two others 
convicted died in prison.

Two young men, both black, were shot to death in Birmingham in the chaos that followed the bombing.

Birmingham
was strictly segregated at the time of the bombing, which occurred as 
city schools were being racially integrated for the first time.

The 
all-black 16th Street Baptist was a gathering spot for civil rights 
demonstrations for months before the blast.

The
bombing became a powerful symbol of the depth of racial hatred in the 
South and helped build momentum for later laws, including the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

During
the commemoration, an honor guard composed of black and whites officers
and firefighters watched over ceremonies with mixed-race crowd, 
something unthinkable in Birmingham in 1963.

That same year, white police officers and firefighters used dogs and 
water hoses on black demonstrators marching for equal rights.

Rev. Bernice King, a daughter of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., noted the changed city in a prayer.

'We
thank you father for the tremendous progress we have made in 50 years, 
that we can sit in the safe confines of this sanctuary being protected 
by the city of Birmingham when 50 years ago the city turned its eye and 
its ears away from us,' she said.

The four victims were honored on Saturday night at a human rights fundraising concert hosted by Jamie Foxx and attended by the Reverend Jesse Jackson. There were performances from Jill Scott and Charlie Wilson.

Awards were presented to Elder Bernice King, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Myrna Jackson, and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, according to al.com.

Reverend Lowery established the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Dr King in the late 1950s and led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.

In his acceptance speech, the Reverend paid tribute to the four girls killed in the bombing.Â 

Earlier this week, Condoleezza Rice recalled her own personal experience of the tragedy. Rice was friends with 11-year-old Denise McNair who died in the blast.

The former Secretary of State has a treasured photo of her friend accepting a kindergarten certificate from Rice's father, who was a pastor at another church.

McNair had gone to preschool there. McNair's father was the community photographer, documenting birthday parties and weddings in happier times.

'Everyone in the black community knew one of those girls,' Rice said.

Her father told her the bombing had been done by 'hateful men', she said, but it was an act that later uncovered something ultimately good.

'Out of great tragedy, people began to recognize our humanity, and it brought people together,' said Rice.
