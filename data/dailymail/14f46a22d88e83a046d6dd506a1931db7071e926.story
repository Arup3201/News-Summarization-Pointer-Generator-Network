Governors have been told to defy a 70-year-old law which says state schools must hold daily Christian assemblies because it is 'meaningless' in today's society.

In a landmark move, the National Governors' Association said many non-faith schools are already ignoring the law because teachers are 'unable or unwilling' to lead group worship.

The organisation, which represents more than 300,000 school governors in England, added: 'Schools are not places of worship, but places of education.'

Archaic law: Christian worship has been compulsory in state schools since 1944 (pictured: assembly in 1962)

The move was welcomed by the British Humanist Association, whose leaders include the atheist scientist Professor Richard Dawkins and the philosopher AC Grayling.

The National Governors' Association had already moved towards banning Christian assemblies in non-faith schools four years ago, when it said they should no longer be compulsory.

Now its policy committee says they should be abolished completely.

It announced in a newsletter to members: 'Few schools can or do meet the current legislative requirement for a 
daily act of collective worship, partly because there isn’t space in 
most schools to gather students together, and often staff are unable or 
unwilling to lead a collective worship session.

'There is also the added 
issue that worship implies belief in a particular faith – if the 'act of
 worship' is not in your faith then it is meaningless as an act of 
worship.

Support: The move was welcomed by the British Humanist Association, whose leaders include Richard Dawkins

'The view was taken that schools are not places of worship, but 
places of education, and expecting the worship of a religion or 
religions in all schools should not be a compulsory part of education in
 England today.

'This is different in schools with a religious character –
 as faith schools are termed in the legislation – where parents have 
chosen to send their child in the knowledge that the particular faith 
and its worship is at the core of the ethos of the school.

'Removing the collective worship from 
the remit of schools that are not faith schools would not prevent them 
from holding assemblies that address a whole range of topics, including 
faith and belief.

'In addition, it does not alter our position on 
religious education; it is important that students should continue to be
 taught a broad and balanced curriculum that encourages a knowledge and 
understanding of all faiths.'

Faith schools, private schools and schools in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will not be affected.

The 1944
 Education Act made it a legal requirement for all English state schools
 to 'provide a daily act of collective worship' for all pupils, unless 
their parents object.

The 
only significant change to the law has been the 1988 Education Act - but
 that only removed a requirement for worship to take place 'at the start
 of the school day'.

Assemblies must still be 'wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character', and head teachers must apply to their local council to allow non-Christian pupils to skip them.

The National Governors' Association said it is consulting with the Department of Education to change the law, which still remains in force.

The change was welcomed by the British Humanist Association, which campaigns to keep church and state separate.

Chief Executive Andrew Copson said: 'The continued operation of this 70-year-old law requiring daily Christian worship in schools is widely opposed.

'Teachers
 don’t want it, parents don’t want it, pupils don’t want it, and 
according to opinion polls, 60 per cent of the public don’t want it.

'Children
 as young as four are coming home and telling their non-religious 
parents they believe in God, or being distressed at age-inappropriate 
tales about hell.

'Worship may be the only place in our over
 regulated schools where the tyranny of SATs and constant assessment can
 for 15 minutes be forgotten'

- Church of England

'In
 a plural and fair-minded society that cares about children and their 
development, schools should be holding inclusive assemblies that forward
 the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of all pupils and
 staff, regardless of their religious or non-religious beliefs.'

The announcement comes in the wake of comments by Education Secretary Michael Gove that all schools should adhere to 'British values'.

And it was criticised today by the Church of England, which said Christian assemblies were about community and shared experience, not just praising God.

The Rev Jan Ainsworth, the Church of England’s chief education officer, said: 'The unique contribution of worship in church schools is to involve pupils in a shared experience of reflection and silence, singing and story framed with reference to Christianity and other religious traditions.

'It takes its place as part of the religious and spiritual education of the pupils, but with a far greater range of possibilities than a lesson leading to well-scripted outcomes.

'Worship may be the only place in our over regulated schools where the tyranny of SATs and constant assessment can for 15 minutes be forgotten and real engagement take place.'
