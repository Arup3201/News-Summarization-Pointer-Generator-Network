A San Francisco 49ers fan has died after suffering a heart attack during the team's first game at their new stadium.

A middle aged man was taken unconscious from the stands and taken to hospital during the third quarter of the team's opening preseason match, according to reports.

The Santa Clara Fire Department said a man was given CPR at the stadium before being taken to O'Connor Hospital in neighboring San Jose where he was pronounced dead.

Emergency services say they had an unusually high number of alerts during the game against the Denver Broncos, likely because of the 80-degree heat.

According to the San Jose Mercury, a middle-aged man wearing a gold 49ers jersey was rushed out of the lower bowl section of the stadium, which was in direct sunlight.

The paper reports that the man was unconscious when he was taken from the stands by the emergency services.

A spokesman for the team said: 'The 49ers organization is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of one of our fans earlier today.

The death marks the second time in two years that a fan has died during a 49ers game. Last year a man died at the old Candlestick stadium after falling from an elevated concourse

'We would like to extend our heartfelt condolences and prayers to his family and friends in this time of sadness.'

The team's 34-0 loss to the Broncos and 80-degree heat drove thousands of fans to leave the new stadium midway through the game. 

The death marks the third person to die at the new Levi's stadium. In October delivery driver Edward Lake II, 60, died while unloading building materials, and in June last year, 63-year-old Donald White after an accident in an elevator shaft.

It is also the second fan death during a game in the last two years. In September 2013 a man died after falling from an elevated walkway during a 49ers match against the Green Bay Packers. 

Santa Clara Fire Department reported an unusually high number of call outs during the game at the new $.13billion Levi's Stadium, likely due to the 80-degree heat
