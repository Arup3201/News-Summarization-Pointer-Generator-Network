Chaos: George Osborne's plan to reform child benefit is causing problems at the HMRC because they are struggling to explain the changes to those involved

George Osborne’s scheme to cut child benefit risks descending into chaos because the taxman is struggling to explain the complicated reforms to parents.

HM Revenue & Customs is planning to send letters to better-off taxpayers in the next few weeks to tell affected families what to do.

The controversial changes will see households where one parent earns more than £50,000 no longer receiving full child benefit. Families where a parent earns more than £60,000 will lose the money entirely.

But the fiendish complexity of the reforms means that the HMRC cannot come up with a form of words that taxpayers can understand.

Letters have been scheduled to be sent since the start of the autumn.

Accountants warn of chaos because the taxman has left it far too late to implement the scheme in time for the planned January 7 launch.

Last night HMRC said the first letters would start to be sent out from next week. A spokesman said they will ‘set out the options clearly so that an informed choice can be made in time for the 7 January rule change’.

The reforms will require half a million people to fill in complicated self-assessment returns for the first time.

From next year, households where one parent earns more than £50,000 will no longer receive the total amount of child benefit, which is worth £1,055 a year for one-child families.

Setting out the options: The HMRC said that it would start sending out letters next week well ahead of the 7th January deadline

Those on more than £60,000 will not receive any at all, with the amount of benefit decreasing on a sliding scale as a person’s salary rises between £50,000 and £60,000. Some 1.2million families are affected.

The new rules have been criticised for penalising stay-at-home mothers because they take into account only the highest salary in the household.

Two working parents each earning just under the limit could earn £100,000 together and retain the full child benefit, while a household with just one income of £60,000 would lose all theirs.

‘The letter isn’t yet ready but it should be ready to go by the end of this week,’ said the HMRC spokesman. ‘We always said it would go out in the autumn and we want to get all the details right.’

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales warned the Coalition yesterday that HMRC had left it too late to implement the scheme in time.

Anita Monteith, a manager at the institute’s tax faculty, said the ‘ill-judged’ policy would overburden a tax system already ‘creaking at the seams’.

‘I don’t think it is the right time to bung in a whole bunch of people who have never had to engage with self-assessment before and be lumbering them with a tax charge that is not intuitive,’ she said.

She added that most people did not know the changes were coming, warning: ‘Jan 7 is not far away.’

Elaine Clark of Cheapaccounting said: ‘There is barely a matter of weeks to go before a radical overhaul, yet those affected know next to nothing about what is happening. It’s a ridiculously complicated system that, in an era supposed to usher in “tax simplification”, looks set to be almost unable to be implemented.’

Mike Warburton of accountants Grant Thornton said: ‘There’s so much work involved and very little time left to get it sorted.

‘For example, it’s going to be very difficult to work out what actually constitutes a family for the purposes of making these tax calculations.

‘How does the taxman work out what constitutes a partner, and how will it track it? It could take at least two years for the policy to settle down.’

Cathy Jamieson, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, said: ‘For hundreds of thousands of parents on middle incomes, who face losing every penny of their child benefit in just a few weeks’ time, this is no laughing matter.

‘David Cameron and George Osborne’s policy is unfair with some couples earning as much as £100,000 keeping all their child benefit but one-earner families on just £50,000 seeing theirs cut.

‘And the chaotic way this ill thought through policy is being implemented looks set to be yet another example of this government’s incompetence.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘It is unfair to continue paying child benefit to those on high incomes and we are making the system fairer by introducing the changes.’

ANALYSIS By SAM DUNN

Within days around 1.2million letters need to be sent to households that will be stripped of child benefit.

Yet officials have still not drafted the all-important wording of the document or even set up a telephone help-line.

The delay is creating enormous uncertainty for families – almost half of which will now need to fill out a self-assessment tax form.

And concerns are growing that thousands of stay-at-home mothers, whose state pension credits depend on child benefit, will be caught out.

When the Chancellor announced the changes, his Treasury aides insisted such parents would not lose out. But there is still no detail as to how this will be made to happen.

There are also complex ‘claw back’ calculations to grapple with from January 7.

Where one partner earns £50,000, the household must pay back 1 per cent of child benefit for every £100 earnt above this – up to the £60,000 ceiling. To make matters worse, the sums are based on the higher earner’s salary – not household income. So, in another first, tax policy may force parents and partners to find out exactly what the other earns.

HM Revenue & Customs appears not to have anticipated fully the impact of half a million families using self-assessment forms for the first time.

Asking them to apply a tricky formula to an already complicated form is a disaster in the making. In particular, the definition of what actually constitutes a ‘partner’ – temporary or otherwise – will be contentious. It is even possible that a man who moves in with a woman who has three children could see himself landed with a £2,450 tax bill.

The way in which families where one earner makes more than £60,000 can opt out of claiming child benefit is also unclear.

The payments are currently worth £20.30 a week for the first child, and £13.40 for further offspring.Taxpayers have suffered greatly at the hands of bungling HMRC in recent years with shock tax demands, shoddy customer service and incorrect tax codes.

All that families want is certainty. But with just weeks to go before child benefit is stripped away, HMRC looks to be heading for another disaster.
