Sumo the cat shocked RSPCA staff earlier this year when the flabby tabby waddled through their doors and tipped the scales at 14.3 kilograms.

Now the chubby kitty has lost more than two kilos in as many months enjoying his new found agility and playfulness.

One of the vet nurses at the Wacol RSPCA in Brisbane - Tanya Boland - has been caring for Sumo since July and told Daily Mail Australia he's much more active and 'quite amused' he's now able to lick his shrinking belly.

'He's doing really well', she said. 'He's been running around, he's a lot more agile.'

When he was brought into the RSPCA Vicki Lomax, a veterinarian working at the centre said Sumo was 'the biggest cat I've ever seen and I've been a vet for 45 years.'

Sumo came to the RSPCA because his owners were moving house and could not take him with them.

When he was brought to the RSPCA centre staff decided to name him and settled, for obvious reasons, on Sumo.

But now the pudgy pet, who weighed almost three times his ideal weight of five to six kilos, is loving a more active lifestyle.

'He's been playing with my cat and bit more and playing with the toys', Ms Boland said of the the nine-year-old domestic short hair.

'They're like brothers and sisters, sometimes they get a long and sometimes they fight.'

'(But) he's a lot more active and he's happy he can lick his belly and his back.'

When at his heaviest Sumo was at serious risk of a number of weight-related diseases such as heart and kidney disease, diabetes, muscle atrophy, and arthritis.

However a strict diet of a new trial Hills brand metabolic cat food split into two meals a day, the fat cat is sure to be a slim Jim in no time.

Keeping up with Ms Boland's younger cat has also helped him shed some kilos

Plus his exercise running up and down the hall of Ms Boland's home with his favourite toy 'rattle mouse' is also helping him shift the weight.

Earlier this year Ms Lomax told Daily Mail Australia that as with humans, pets get overweight from a combination of overfeeding and lack of exercise.

She warned: 'Cats can be very persistent, there are cats that will follow you to the fridge and more or less demand food. There are owners who have trouble saying no, I guess it's like parents saying no to the kids.'

Ms Boland said although she's enjoying the time spent with Sumo and her younger cat Jasmine, her house simply isn't big enough for two cats in the long term.

'I've got a friend's mother who's interested in adopting him', Ms Boland revealed.

'She's had a fat cat before so she knows what they're like to handle.'

Though the vet nurse did admit she'll be sad to see Sumo go when he's lost a little more weight.

'He's a funny little character but my house just isn't big enough for two cats.'
