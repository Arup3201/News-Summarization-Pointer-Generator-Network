A picture of the couple was posted on Miss Chaihirunkarn's Facebook page in October last year with the words: 'Happy 1st year anniversary'

Police said she was shot several times in the head and chest.

The man was identified as 29-year-old Bryan Springer. He graduated in 2007 and worked at CMU's Software Engineering Institute.

Police Cmdr. RaShall Brackney said friends told police the couple's relationship was troubled, but there were no signs of a struggle.

Friends said they hadn't seen the woman for days. 

Police and the medical examiner are trying to determine when the shooting occurred. 

Investigators reported today that Springer purchased the weapon and ammunition on Tuesday from Iron City Armory in Bridgeville. 

According to social media, the couple were both originally from Thailand.  

On her Facebook page, Miss Chaihirunkarn posted a picture of herself and Springer together in October 2014 with the message: 'You will forever be my always'.

She had written in the caption: 'Happy 1st year anniversary.'

The 26-year-old computer science student was believed to have been with her boyfriend for just over a year
