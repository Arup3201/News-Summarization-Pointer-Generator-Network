A woman accused of abandoning her newborn baby in a trash can was released from jail on Monday and told reporters as she left that she hadn't known she was pregnant.

Alicia Marie Englert, 23, posted $25,000 bond after it was reduced from $500,000 and left the Salt Lake County Jail in Utah on Monday evening. 

She said she was sorry about what had happened with the baby girl, who is now in the custody of child welfare workers.

Earlier on Monday, a judge reduced Englert's bail and ordered tests to determine if she's mentally competent to stand trial on a charge of attempted murder. 

Her bail was reduced on certain conditions, Deseret News reported. 

She is not allowed to have contact with her parents and must live with her brother instead. The only instance that she is allowed to contact them is if she needs a ride to court and then they must not discuss the case.

The reasons behind the conditions were not explained in court.    

Englert's parents have previously said she has a learning disability and didn't understand what she was doing or why it was wrong. 

She told reporters on Monday she had a disability, which she didn't describe. Messages left with Englert's defense attorneys Zach Weyher and Josie Brumfield were not immediately returned Tuesday.

Prosecutors said Englert gave birth in August at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns. 

She left the baby without food or medical care for at least a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash on August 26, according to prosecutors.

Authorities haven't determined the baby's father, but Englert said on Monday night that the baby's father knows about the child. 

Englert has been ordered not to contact him. She did not identify the father.

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said the baby would have died if she hadn't been found by a neighbor who thought she heard a purring cat. 

The girl was inside a trash can under bags of trash and suffering from hypothermia, respiratory distress and a blood-borne infection.

She has since improved and is now in fair condition, Unified Police said. 

If convicted, Englert faces up to life in prison.

Englert made her first appearance in court last month, where her attorneys said they need time to investigate the 23-year-old's mental condition. 

Prosecutors say her lack of care shows she deliberately tried to kill the child.

'It's certainly a testament to how resilient these babies can be,' Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill said last month. 'It's quite remarkable that the baby is doing well and is improving steadily.'

Fox13 previously published a photo album of Englert allegedly drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing - 'potentially within the same window of time that she was pregnant,' the station said.

Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Gill said. 

But her father, Robert Englert, said his daughter has only just recently started to realize what she had done. 

'She doesn't even realize that it's a crime and it's bad,' Englert told The Salt Lake Tribune last month.

'Even when the police were taking her to jail, she thought they were taking her to her room.'

He told the newspaper he didn't know who the baby's father was. 

The woman's mother, Tammy Englert, told The Deseret News last week that her daughter didn't understand what had happened.

'We tried to explain it to her, and she didn't realize it was that bad what she had done,'she said.

She said her daughter had gained weight recently, but she had no idea Alicia Englert was pregnant.

'I'm not going to tell my daughter, "You're fat, and lose some weight,"' she told the newspaper. 'How do you do that?'

Gill said they had no evidence of any disability and that it was not a factor in his decision about charges. If Englert suffers from any condition, that issue will be dealt with as the case moves through the courts, he said.
