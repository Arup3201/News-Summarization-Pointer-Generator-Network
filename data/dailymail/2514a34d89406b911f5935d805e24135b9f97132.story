Horrifying stories of physical and sexual abuse suffered for decades by mixed-race and Aboriginal children at a home in Darwin is unfolding at a national inquiry.

Children in care at the Retta Dixon Home were flogged with belt buckles, sexually abused in cars, raped in chicken sheds and chained up in bed 'like a dog', a royal commission heard on Monday.

The Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse hearing is sitting in Darwin to examine the home, which from 1946 until 1980, housed children of mixed descent as well as some unmarried mothers.

The compelling evidence came from a number of former residents who told of immense cruelty by 'house parents' who oversaw cottages housing up to 12 children at a time in the home run by the Aborigines Inland Mission. 

Sandra Kitching (pictured) said when she spoke up in protest of a baby being abused that her 'house parent' tore her clothes off and chained her to her bed overnight on chains so short she couldn't sit or sleep properly

Sandra Kitching told the commission her house parent, George Pounder, force-fed an infant cabbage and cauliflower until she was coughing and choking.

When Ms Kitching spoke up in protest, she said he tore her clothes off and chained her to her bed overnight on chains so short she couldn't sit or sleep properly.

The baby died not long after, she told the commission

Lorna Cubillo, now 78, was born at Banka Banka Station in Central Australia and was taken away from her family in 1947 when she was aged eight and lived at the home until she was 16.

One of the girls in her dormitory used to have fits 'and was chained up with a dog chain to her bed', Ms Cubillo told the commission sitting in Darwin on Monday.

'She was fed with an enamel plate and cup, just like a dog, and often had bad chafing around her ankle where the chain would rub.'

Ms Cubillo told the commission that Des Walters, who along with his wife were the house parents of her dormitory, was a physically abusive man.

'He flogged me that much that after a while it didn't hurt anymore,' she said.

'I never cried though, and because he wasn't winning he turned the strap around and used the buckle.

'Sometimes he would hit me over the face and head and I would bleed.'

He fondled her breasts, and touched her upper thigh in his car, she alleged.

'It was like I was being stalked and everywhere I went, he was there.'

Although a teacher at school seemed to suspect something was happening, Ms Cubillo never told anyone about the abuse because she was too scared it would get back to Mr Walters and he would beat her.

Once, after swimming on a Sunday despite knowing it was against the rules, she said Mr Walters hit her so hard with the buckle end of his belt that he cut her breast.

She eventually took court action against him in 1998 regarding the physical abuse, but never told anyone about the sexual abuse.

She thinks that was why she lost the case.

'I have tried to get over what happened to me but I just can't get past it,' she said.

One witness alleged a girl who failed to properly tidy a kitchen was woken by house mother, Judy Fergusson, and stabbed multiple times on her hands with a can opener until she bled.

Children up to the age of 12 who wet the bed would be undressed and paraded in nappies in front of the other children, she said.

Former resident Kenneth Stagg said children became overly sexualised because of abuse by staff and other children.

One witness, whose identity was suppressed, said boys at the home sexually abused her from the age of five.

'I thought it was normal behaviour and a part of life,' she told the commission.

She was sent to foster care in NSW and said one of her foster parents told her it was because Retta Dixon staff were concerned girls would get pregnant.

'I think this shows the staff probably knew that sexual activity was taking place but they failed to protect the children from it,' she said.

'House parents' oversaw cottages housing up to 12 children at a time in the Darwin home

Mr Stagg told the commission under privilege that house parent Mr Henderson 'was well known amongst all the children as a molester'.

'All the children knew Mr Henderson was doing terrible things to the children in No. 2 cottage ... all of the children thought of him as a bad man.'

A witness, known as AKU, who lived in a cottage overseen by Henderson said he sexually abused her about twice a week between the ages of five and 13.

He once put her on his bed facing a mirror as he made her touch his genitals with her feet.

He raped boys in the chook shed, she said. 

When she was 12, she 'accidentally slammed the car door and Don Henderson swung around and backhanded me in the face and broke my nose'.

She said she bled for three days until Henderson's wife Barbara finally took her to hospital for treatment, telling the doctor she'd fallen out of a tree.

None of the witnesses had sought redress, mostly they spoke of wanting an apology from the Aborigines Inland Mission and the government, of erecting a memorial, or of receiving counselling.

'The physical, emotional and sexual abuse I suffered at Retta Dixon took my childhood away and I can't get that back. No amount of money can give that back to me,' AKU said. 

None of the witnesses reported the abuse when it was happening.
