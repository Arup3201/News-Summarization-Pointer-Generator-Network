The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said several months after Bowe Bergdahl disappeared that he knew the then-infantryman had deserted, a former platoon mate of Bergdahl's revealed Monday.

'The joint chief of staff, Admiral [Michael] Mullen at the time. He came out to our unit and had Thanksgiving dinner, and he said, "Yeah he walked off, everybody knows he walked off, I don’t know why they’re trying to" 'act like he didn't, former Army Specialist Cody Full said in an interview released yesterday by The Daily Caller.

Full's admission that the top-ranking military official knew Berghdal intended to abandon his post in Afghanistan on June, 30, 2009 comes on the eve of the Army's first formal interview with Sgt Bergdahl for it's investigation into charges of desertion.

A former platoon mate of Bergdahl's, Cody Full, claims the military has known for years that Berghdal knowingly abandoned his post

Tomorrow Major General Kenneth Pow will question Bergdahl at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, the New York Daily News reports. Bergdhal returned to active duty at the military base several weeks ago.

Full, a 25-year-old former
 infantryman who now lives in Houston, Texas, has been one of Bergdahl's most outspoken critics since the former prisoner of war was exchanged in late May for five Taliban commanders.

A few days after Bergdahl's release, Full told MailOnline his former roommate is 'a deserter at best, and a traitor at worst.'

'He wasn't
 out on some patrol one day and got captured by the Taliban, and nobody 
smuggled him off of the base,'  Full said. 'This
 soldier knew what he was doing. He left us. He willingly 
and premeditatedly deserted his comrades.

'And he put his team, his 
squad, his platoon, his company, and thousands of other American 
soldiers in Afghanistan at a very high risk trying to find him,' Full charged.

Full told Fox News in an interview the same week that Bergdahl did not serve the United State with honor.'

At a congressional hearing in mid-June, Full sad Bergdahl should be hauled before a military court and slapped with eight separate criminal charges, including desertion, insubordination and disobeying orders.

Regardless of the circumstances of Bergdahl's disappearance, the United States has a responsibility to rescue American soldiers who go missing overseas, President Barack Obama said in response to accusations that Bergdahl deserted.

Current chairman of the Joint Chiefs Army General Martin 
Dempsey said the Taliban trade was 
'likely our last, best opportunity' to rescue Bergdahl. The government had tried to negotiate Bergdahl's release in the past but could not come to an agreement with the terrorist organization.

As part of the eventual deal, five Taliban fighters were released to Qatar on the condition that they 
stay there for the next year. The Qatari government is responsible for tracking their movements during that time.

Lawmakers have voiced concerns 
that the five men - whom they say were among the most dangerous prisoners at the terrorist holding facility in Guantanamo Bay - will return to Afghanistan upon their release and take up 
arms again.

Army Col. Mark Mitchell, a Green Beret who helped bring in one of the terrorists, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, told the Washington Times today that Fazl is a 'psychopath, and he’s probably a danger to fellow Afghans' but he's not likely a threat to Americans.

Lawmakers are concerned that Mullah Mohammad Fazl, pictured here, and the four other Taliban fighters the White House swapped with Bergdahl will take up arms against the U.S. when they are released from Qatar next year

Fazl and the other four men 'have been off the battlefield for 12 years. In that time, Afghanistan 
has changed, the Taliban has changed and other leaders have risen 
through the ranks while he’s been enjoying a comfortable, if highly 
structured, life at Guantanamo Bay,' Mitchell said.

'So, it won’t be as simple as simply walking back through the door and picking up where he left off,' he explained. 'There’s lots of Afghans, probably even a few Talibs, that have no desire to see him back in Afghanistan, much less in any kind of position of authority.'

Republicans on the House Armed Services committee said last week that they continue to feel uneasy about the circumstances of Bergdahl's release and the terror trade, however, and voted in favor of a resolution formally reprimanding Obama for his actions.

'There are serious questions related to the circumstances of which he became a prisoner of the Taliban and the Haqqani network,' Republican Rep. Scott Rigell, a sponsor of the legislation, told The Daily Caller last week.

The committee's Republican members and two Democrats voted to pass a non-binding resolution condemning Obama for failing to notify Congress of the swap 30 days prior, as required to by law, and failing to properly consider the 'repercussions of negotiating with terrorists.'

The resolution will be considered by the full House of Representatives when Congress returns from recess next month and has a strong chance of passing in the Republican-led legislative body.
