It didn’t just take dedication for Wendy Davis to filibuster the Texas state senate for 11 hours over an abortion bill: it also took a urinary catheter.

After photos of her hot pink running shoes showed how she kept her feet from aching, and a shot of her donning a back brace to soothe her back surfaced, now comes this revelation of how the 50-year-old democrat stayed on the legislature floor and out of the ladies room for so long Tuesday.

And her dedication didn’t even end there. Food and water are banned during filibusters, but rising star Davis was even deprived of the hard candy and ice chips normally provided to long-winded legislation blockers.

At least according to Joel Burns, who knows Davis and told The Star-Telegram he watched the entire dramatic day on the Texas senate floor play out.

The former single teen mom-turned-Harvard law school graduate became an overnight political star after pledging to block a bill that would have effectively shut down most of the Lone Star State’s abortion clinics and banned abortions after 20 weeks.

As a midnight deadline to pass the legislation loomed and Davis continued to talk, political junkies from coast-to-coast tuned in via Internet, and the senator's followers on Twitter ballooned from around 1,200 to more than 79,000.

As of Thursday afternoon, that number stood at over 100,000.

Pro tips #1: Wear a back brace. Mrs Davis is helped into hers, which helped her stay upright for her 11-hour speech Tuesday on the Texas senate floor

Pro tip #2: Wear comfy shoes. Mrs Davis wore pink running shoes to prepare for the marathon session of speaking - for which she was not even allowed to lean against the table

Pro tip#3: Don't go to the bathroom, just use a urinary catheter, like this one. The bags act as a sort of external bladder and helped Mrs Davis to stay on the senate floor for 11 hours straight

Suddenly, photos of her Mizuno Women's Wave Rider 16 Running Shoes were everywhere, and customers began jamming online sales sites with such comments as the pair was ‘perfect for a filibuster.’ Even #StandWithWendy was trending.

The makers of the ubiquitous Taiwanese animated re-enactments Next Media Animation even made a Wendy Davis video where the lawmaker flies into the senate wearing superhero spandex and high-fives the ghost of Anne Richards as coat hanger-wielding supporters cheer on their hero.

It is a very odd ode to a rare moment where a Democrat in the deepest of red states was able to fend off, if just for a day, the efforts of a Republican majority.

Obama's official Twitter account posted: ‘Something special is happening in Austin tonight.’ Similar messages of support came from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Other forms of support: Abortion-rights activists packed the Texas Senate gallery and objected loudly when Davis' Tuesday night filibuster was ended over a string of three rules violations

Davis' dedication and sudden surge in popularity come as no surprise to Texas Democrats, who chose her as the face of the battle to block the bill.

‘She's a total fighter,’ said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and daughter of the late former Texas Gov. Ann Richards. ‘And the thing about Sen. Davis, she says she's going to do something, she gets it done.’

Davis' filibuster ultimately ended as Republicans complained she had strayed off topic and cut her off.

But that action prompted a lengthy debate with Democrats and deafening protests from hundreds of orange-clad abortion-rights activists in the gallery that spilled past the midnight deadline to kill all pending legislation.

Even after she had stopped speaking, however, Davis continued to stand for more than an additional hour while her colleagues argued about whether her filibuster was really over.

‘Thanks to the powerful voices of thousands of Texans, #SB5 is dead,’ Davis tweeted Wednesday morning. ‘An incredible victory for Texas women and those who love them.’

Davis starting working at age 14 to help support a household of her single mother and three siblings.

By 19, she was already married and divorced with a child of her own. After community college, she graduated from Texas Christian University before being accepted to Harvard Law School.

She returned to Texas to become a Fort Worth City Council member before upsetting an incumbent Republican for a seat in the state Senate.

‘We knew about her on the City Council,’ said Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston. ‘And we knew her track record as someone you could count on in the heat of battle.’

The victory may be short-lived, though. 
On Wednesday, Gov. Rick Perry called a second special session beginning 
July 1, giving the Republican majority in the statehouse another 30 days
 to re-ignite the abortion debate - and likely finish the job this time.

Small victory? Though Davis' fame may be lasting her victory will likely not be. He's called for a July 1 special session to push the bill through

Davis narrowly retained her Senate seat during elections last year, but her victory allowed the Democrats to hold 12 of the chamber's 31 seats, just enough to block contentious bills from coming to the floor. She is up for re-election again in 2014, though Democratic operatives have already begun a whisper campaign urging her to run for governor.

A Democrat has not won statewide office in Texas since 1994, but those whispers are sure to get louder now. An email from Battleground Texas, a much-ballyhooed effort by former Obama campaign veterans to energize Latino voters and turn the state blue, read Wednesday: ‘Last night an incredible thing happened. Wendy Davis stood up to Texas Republicans.’

But she soon likely sat down.

‘My back hurts,’ Davis said when it was over. ‘I don't have a lot of words left.

Work it out: Davis has a stretch during her successful 11-hour filibuster, which was helped along by comfortable shoes, a back brace, and a urinary catheter
