A Fremont man is facing charges that he tried to hang his girlfriend from a backyard tree and cops say he may have succeeded if she wasn't able to call them while he took a cigarette break.

Daniel Howard, 31, was arraigned on Wednesday on charges of attempted murder and criminal threat.

Cops said that they found Howard on 
Sunday evening standing behind his girlfriend, who was tied to a tree 
with a rope fashioned as a noose around her neck.

Her hands were bound together with a zip tie.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that when Howard went inside the home to take a smoking break, the girlfriend seized an opportunity, pulling her cell phone out of her pocket to call 911.

The emergency dispatcher had difficulty hearing the woman, but was able to pinpoint an address.

The girlfriend was not identified.

One of Howard's brothers, who lives 
with him and was home at the time of the incident, told CBS San 
Francisco that the Howard was likely high on meth at the time of the 
incident.

Police told CBS San Francisco
that Howard was only seconds away from kicking a barrel that the 
girlfriend was standing on when officers showed up at the home.

They said he also tried to use the woman as a human shield before throwing her into an embankment and fleeing from the backyard.

He was arrested a few yards away after a
short foot-chase.

The woman was taken to a nearby hospital for 
treatment of minor injuries.

Police spokeswoman Geneva Bosques said that the woman would not be alive if police had not shown up when they did.

She told CBS San Francisco: 'He would have killed her.

'He would have hung her from that rope.'

Bail has not yet been set for Howard, who remains in jail.

The Fremont home was familiar to officers, who had been there numerous times on calls related to drug offenses, according to the station.
