Eerie pictures have emerged of hundreds of terrified passengers fleeing the foggy scene where a plane crash-landed in Nepal on Wednesday.

Although all of the 224 passengers and 11 crew on board the Turkish Airline flight THY726 were safely evacuated after the incident, commuters have described the distressing scenario.

'We could feel the tyres skid... I could see an air hostess from my seat, she had tears in her eyes,' Dikesh Malhotra, a 28-year-old business man on the flight said.

Mr Malhotra, said the impact of the landing caused bags to fall on terrified passengers, who clutched their seats, anxiously waiting for the plane to stop moving.

When the plane stopped, smoke filled the cabin, making it difficult to breathe, he said.

'Everyone got up and started shouting to open the door... finally they announced evacuation... we were so relieved,' Mr Malhotra said.

The fortunate passengers on-board escaped with only minor bumps and bruises, as officials confirmed there were no serious injuries.

Air authorities said that the plane, which was arriving from Istanbul in Turkey, came off the runway in Nepal's capital Kathmandu in the early hours of the morning

Two consecutive days of rain had left the runway at Tribhuwan International Airport in Nepal's capital extremely slippery and there was dense fog at the time

The plane, which was on a seven-hour flight from the Turkish capital, was forced to circle for 30 minutes over Nepal before it made a second attempt to land

Air authorities said that the plane, which was arriving from Istanbul in Turkey, came off the runway in Nepal's capital Kathmandu in the early hours of the morning.

Two consecutive days of rain had left the runway at Tribhuwan International Airport in Nepal's capital extremely slippery and there was dense fog at the time.

Airport spokesman Purna Prasad Chudal said the pilot overshot the runway during an initial attempt to land, before making a second try that sent the plane skidding off the tarmac.

The plane, which was on a seven-hour flight from the Turkish capital, was forced to circle for 30 minutes over Nepal before it made a second attempt to land.

Following the accident, the craft was left stuck in the grass near the runway with technicians unable to remove the damaged Airbus 330 in the absence of suitable equipment.

Concern: Emergency services rushed to the scene of the crash, but fortunately passengers suffered only minor injuries

Following the accident, the craft was left stuck in the grass near the runway with technicians unable to remove the damaged Airbus 330 in the absence of suitable equipment.

'We are trying to bring specialised removal equipment from India tomorrow morning in an army plane that can land in the available stretch of runway,' another airport official, Bharat Kumar Shrestha,said.

Chudal said officials would launch an investigation into the crash and question the pilot.

'The plane had permission to land and while conditions were foggy earlier, visibility was ok,' Chudal told AFP.

Crashed: The front of the Airbus was damaged after the crash. Officials say passengers had bumps and bruises but no serious injuries

Secure: Air officials secured the aircraft after it crashed following its second attempt to land in dense fog

'We are not sure how this happened.'

The only international airport in Nepal remained closed Wednesday morning after the accident.

The Himalayan nation is home to some of the world's most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks and terrain that poses a challenge even for accomplished pilots.

A string of crashes as well as the European Union's decision to blacklist all Nepalese airlines prompted government officials last year to announce plans to install new radar and weather monitoring systems.
