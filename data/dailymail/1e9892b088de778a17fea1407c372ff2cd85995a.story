A medical student who tried to blame his ex-girlfriend for stabbing a Georgetown classmate has been found guilty of his murder. 

Rahul Gupta, 25, was found guilty of first-degree murder after Mark Waugh, 23, was found stabbed to death in Gupta's apartment in Silver Springs, Virginia in 2013.

It took the jury just 4 1/2 hours to reach the verdict - Gupta appeared to be wiping away tears when it was announced.

Gupta initially confessed to the crime saying he did it because Waugh was cheating with his girlfriend.

But in court, Gupta's attorneys claimed he only made the confession as he was protecting his now ex-girlfriend Taylor Gould, who had in fact killed Waugh, reports the Washington Post.

'This was an act of violent, crazy rage,' one his attorneys, Jennifer Page, told jurors, later adding, 'You bet she was capable.' 

Gould who has not been charged with anything and is not on trial, testified, telling jurors that she'd been too drunk on the night in question to remember what happened.

'I had no reason to hurt anyone,' she said.

My Fox DC reports Gupta took the stand during the trial in his own defense. 

In testimony he claimed he went to the aid of Waugh and was trying to stop the bleeding. 

In a 911 call placed by the girlfriend, he is heard in the background saying "Come on Mark."  

Gupta, his 23-year-old girlfriend, Waugh and one other had spent the night celebrating Gupta's birthday.

Gould consumed at least six drinks, including red wine, a whiskey-and-cranberry, an Irish coffee, and a margarita. 

Dark turn: The group spent a Saturday night out celebrating Gupta's birthday. The first three later returned to the girlfriend's apartment where they continued to drink shots

After drinking, Gupta and Waugh returned to Gupta's girlfriend's apartment in Silver Springs at 1:30am where the three continued drinking shots of alcohol. 

Taylor Gould says she was too drunk the night of the murder to remember anything clearly 

Neighbors later reported hearing loud noises coming from the apartment, like people were moving furniture.

Shortly before 3:30am Sunday morning, police responded to a 911 call made by the girlfriend.

When they arrived on the scene, police reported hearing movements and yelling inside but no one answered the door when they knocked.

Police opened the locked door and Gould approached the officers with blood on her and said: 'I don't know what happened. Can you tell me?'

Officers noted seeing blood on the walls of the kitchen and living area and Gupta lying on the floor, covered in blood.

They asked Gupta if he was hurt but he said: 'I don't think so'.

Prosecutor Patrick Mays told the court that when asked what had happened, Gupta told them: 'My girlfriend and my buddy were cheating. I walked in on my girlfriend and my buddy cheating. I killed my buddy.'  

Officers found Waugh lying on the floor unresponsive and he was pronounced dead - he had been stabbed six times  and slashed five times. His lung was punctured and his jugular vein cut. 

The prosecutor said: 'Mr. Waugh did not die immediately.'

'He could have lived for several minutes before dying from loss of blood.'

Mays told jurors that a palm print and fingerprint — in Waugh’s blood — also implicate Gupta.  

At police headquarters, Gupta admitted that he made a mistake, but added: 'He tried to kill me, though'. 

While Gupta says he was woken up by his girlfriend yelling, the girlfriend told police she was woken up by Gupta's yelling. She says she found him kneeling next to a bleeding Waugh and he told her to call police. Above, a picture of Waugh

Defense? While being questioned by police, Gupta admitted that he made a mistake but also said that Waugh tried to kill him

Gupta's attorneys argued the reason he was covered in blood was because he had been performing CPR on his friend.

Defense attorney Philip Armstrong told the court that Gould, who is now a biomedical engineer in Washington, had got blood on the red dress she was wearing and then changed her clothes before the police arrived.

He asked Gould why one of her contact lenses was found stuck to the back of Waugh’s pants. 

My Fox DC reports that during closing arguments assistant state's attorney Timothy Hagan told the jury 'Police ask him what happens. What he confesses to is first degree murder… He's caught.'

There was also a recorded phone call from jail that Gupta made to his father after his arrest saying, "Mark and I got into a fight and he tried to get the knife."  

Waugh had graduated Magna Cum Laude from James Madison University in May 2012, and went on to spend the following year in Daegu, South Korea teaching debate. 

 Waugh had started his first year of law school at Georgetown, and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honors society.

Gupta had a similarly bright future. 

He earned his undergraduate degree from George Washington University and was back at the school studying to become a doctor. 

He also earned a master's degree in physiology from Georgetown. 

Fellow Langley High School-alumnus David Barton spoke about both men in The Breeze - James Madison University's student newspaper.

He remembers both men for being extremely intelligent in their respective fields, Waugh in liberal arts and Gupta with science and math.

'It's very shocking when something like this happens when you know each person involved,' Barton told The Breeze. 

'You think that - how can people you think to be rational have something like this take place. You just hope that the situation could have de-escalated'.
