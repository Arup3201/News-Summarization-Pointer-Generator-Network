Australia's top-paid cricketer Shane Watson and his young family are hoping to sell their stunning waterfront property for at least $4 million when it goes to auction. 

Watson, his sports journalist wife Lee and their adorable 18-month-old son Will live at the luxurious property in Caringbah South in Sydney's south.

The couple bought the luxe Grandview Parade home for $3.9 million in 2010 but have listed the property for more than $4 million. 

Lee and her little boy were photographed by Julie Adams at the home earlier this year, in a beautiful shoot with The Grace Tales, at the idyllic waterfront home.

Shane and Lee Watson are hoping their stunning waterside property will sell for more than $4 million when the Caringbah South home goes up for auction.

The property boasts uninterrupted views across Buraneer Bay, as well as an infinity-edge pool, a jetty and deep water mooring.

Australian cricket team vice-captain and all-rounder Shane Watson bought the property in 2010 with his sport journalist wife, Lee. The couple now live in the property with their 18-month-old son, Will.

The amazing home is certainly perfect for those who, like the Watsons, love life by the water. 

The home has an infinity-edge pool, jetty, pontoon, deepwater mooring and uninterrupted water views over Burraneer Bay.

The modern home is the ultimate place to entertain, with a modern pool-side retreat.

Shane and Lee have a jaw-dropping walk-in wardrobe in their spacious ensuite, including wall to wall hanging space - not to mention a chandelier and water views!

The two-storey, five-bedroom, four-bathroom is 'unsurpassed in style or substance', according to selling agent David Highland of Highland Property Agents.

It offers a 'lifestyle of sophistication and unrivalled modern style.'

The Sutherland Shire home boasts an incredible cellar, as well as a home cinema - the perfect spot for Shane to review his cricket performance when the all-rounder is home from international tournaments.

However the Watsons spend up to ten months of the year travelling due to Watson's cricketing commitments. 

Lee has previously said that it's 'certainly not ideal' to travel so often with a toddler, but says 'we love being together as a family and wouldn't want it any other way,' in an interview with The Grace Tales.

Shane and Lee married in 2010 on the Central Coast, four years after meeting. They welcomed their first child, son Will on March 14 last year.

Photos also give a glimpse of the draw-dropping walk-in wardrobe in the couple's spacious ensuite - which includes water views and a chandelier. 

The pair married on the Central Coast in 2010, four years after they met through mutual friends. 

They welcomed their son, Will, on March 14, 2013. They describe his birth as the most 'amazing' day of their lives.

The loving wife and mother was one of Australia's top sports presenters for Fox Sports Australia. 

Lee and Shane are frequently travelling with their little boy, due to Watson's cricketing commitments. Lee has previously said that it's 'certainly not ideal' to travel so often with a toddler, but says 'we love being together as a family and wouldn’t want it any other way.'

The beautiful retreat promises an idyllic lifestyle for any Sydney-sider.

A BRW article in February asserts that Shane Watson was Australia's top earning cricketer for 2013 - even ahead of Aussie skipper, Michael Clarke. 

The list claims that Watson is no. 6 of the top Australian sport earners, having earned $6 million, whilst 'Pup' trails behind at no. 7 on $5.5 million. This is largely due to Watson's involvement in the lucrative Indian Premier League.
