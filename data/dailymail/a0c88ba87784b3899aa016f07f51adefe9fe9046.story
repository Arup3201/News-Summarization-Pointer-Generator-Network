Fastfood chain Hungry Jacks has hijacked a promotional campaign from its chief competitor McDonald's.

Earlier this month, McDonald's launched its annual Monopoly campaign, promising 'millions of prizes and the chance to win $1 million instantly on a Big Mac'.

In what has been branded 'Flame Their McOpoly', Hungry Jacks, the Australian variant of Burger King, has this week launched a counter promotion, promising to hand out free burgers, fries and drinks to anyone who presents prize-winning Monopoly tickets. 

Australian fast-food franchise Hungry Jacks are promising to give free meals to anyone who presents winning tickets from the McDonald's Monopoly campaign, which started earlier this month

On a promotional ad on the Hungry Jack's site, the website read:

'Real flame-grilled taste, like air, is vital to life. No one should be denied it – our friends, our family and all Australians. So redeem your FREE tickets* at Hungry Jack's instead, because everyone deserves a better flame-grilled burger.'

The bottom of the ad reads: 

'*In no way endorsed or authorised by you know who'. 

On Hungry Jacks official Facebook page, there has been a medley of different responses. One user, Katy Johnston posted:

'I like this! Good on you HJ's! Such a cheap and affective way of tackling the market! I'm impressed'

There are over over 20 million prizes still unclaimed from the McdDonald's promotion

Others were less flattering, speculating that the restaurant could be facing legal snags over the campaign.

Alicia Hughes wrote: 'Think I smell a law suit mcloving it!'

Saffie Johnny-Moore, posted: 'How does it make you feel that you have rip off 'you know who's' ideas just to make a profit? ..Maybe come up with newer and fresher ideas and then you wouldn't have to steal other peoples.

Another user, Liam, posted: I hope McDonald's sues HJ

Hungry Jacks responded personally, writing: Hey Liam! The appropriate legal requirements have been adhered to in developing this campaign

As of Thursday, the Maccas Play website said over 20 million prizes were still unclaimed.
