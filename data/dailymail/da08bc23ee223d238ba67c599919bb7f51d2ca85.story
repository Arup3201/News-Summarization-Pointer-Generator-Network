It was a fitting occasion for the 4th of July. A statue of Ronald Reagan was unveiled at the American Embassy in London yesterday to mark the centenary of the former U.S. president's birth.

Foreign Secretary William Hague and former U.S. secretary of state Condoleezza Rice watched as the 10ft bronze figure was revealed in Grosvenor Square.

Sadly Mr Reagan's great political ally and
 friend, former prime minister Baroness Thatcher, was unable to attend 
due to her frailty.

Mr Hague paid tribute to the late president at the ceremony outside the U.S. embassy, hailing him 'a great American hero'.

Speaking of Baroness Thatcher's absence, he added: 'She has asked me to say these words to you: "Ronald Reagan was a great president and a great man - a true leader for our times. Through his strength and his conviction, he brought millions of people to freedom as the Iron Curtain finally came down."'

The statue of Mr Reagan was commissioned as part of a year of celebrations. It will stand alongside statues of other American presidents such as Franklin D Roosevelt and Dwight D Eisenhower, another Republican who served two terms.

It is the sixth of a U.S. president in Central London. The others are George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy.

Although the embassy is moving from 
its central London home next year, the statues will remain at their 
current Grosvenor Square location.

Miss Rice, who was representing the late president's widow Nancy Reagan, gave the keynote speech at a gala dinner for 700 people at The Guildhall later in the day.

The statue was commissioned by the Reagan Memorial Fund Trust.

Mr Reagan died in 2004 at the age of 93, having served as president between 1981 and 1989. 

The unveiling of the statue - which cost $1million - is part of a year-long series of events to mark the 
centenary of Reagan's birth, organised by the Ronald Reagan Presidential 
Foundation.

In the weeks prior to the London unveiling, statues have been 
unveiled and conferences convened in Krakow, Budapest and Prague.

Friends: Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were notable political allies and great friends. Sadly she was too frail to attend the ceremony in Grosvenor Square

Ronald Wilson Reagan, born February 6, 1911, was the 40th president of the United States serving two terms, 1981–1989.

He was the 33rd Governor of California, from 1967 to 1975, a job later taken by another actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

He grew up in Illinois, and was educated at Eureka College where he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and sociology.

Upon graduation, Reagan first moved to Iowa to work as a radio broadcaster. His speciality was creating vivid accounts of football games.

He began a career as an actor, first in films and later television, appearing in over 50 movies and leading to his adoption as the 'face' of Chesterfield cigarettes

Some of his most notable roles are in the American Football saga Knute Rockne: All American, which gave him the lifelong nickname 'The Gipper'
 from the character he played and also Kings Row, in which he uttered the 
lines after his character's legs were amputated: 'Where's the 
rest of me?'.

Reagan served as president of the Screen
 Actors Guild, and later spokesman for General Electric.
Originally a member of the Democratic Party, he switched to the Republican Party in 1962.

John Heubusch, executive director of the foundation, says the events are part 
of fulfilling the mission 'to preserve and promote the president's legacy'.

Westminster City Council made an exception to its usual rule refusing 
permission for statues until ten years have passed since the subject's 
death.

Steve Summers, 
chairman of Westminster City Council's planning applications sub-committee, said: 'Regardless of politics, nobody can dispute that 
President Reagan was a true ally of this country.'

As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives.

His supply-side economic policies, dubbed 'Reaganomics', advocated reducing tax rates to spur economic growth, controlling the money supply to reduce inflation, deregulation of the economy, and reducing government spending.

In his first term, he survived an assassination attempt, took a hard line against trade unions, and ordered military actions in Grenada.

He was re-elected in a landslide in 1984, proclaiming it was 'Morning in America'.

His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the Cold War, the 1986 bombing of Libya, and the revelation of the Iran-Contra affair.

Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an 'evil empire', he  presided over a massive military build-up that the USSR bankrupted itself trying to keep up with.

His negotiations with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev culminated in the decrease of both countries' nuclear arsenals.

Reagan left office in 1989 as the Berlin Wall came down and the Cold War ended, a seeming vindication of his policies.

In 1994, the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier in the year

He died ten years later at the age of 93, on June 5, 2004.

He ranks highly in public opinion polls of U.S. presidents, and is a conservative icon.
