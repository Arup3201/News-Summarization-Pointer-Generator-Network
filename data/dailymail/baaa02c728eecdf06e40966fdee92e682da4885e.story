These haunting images reveal the battlefields of World War One as they look today - one hundred years after the fighting broke out.

The powerful and atmospheric shots were taken by photographer, Michael St Maur Sheil, who spent seven years on the project.

The collection, called Fields of Battle-Lands of Peace 14-18, form an open-air exhibition featuring 60 freestanding photographs, each measuring 1.2 metres (4ft) by 1.8 metres (5ft 10in).

The reconstructed gateway of the Chateau de Soupir in northern France, which was badly destroyed  during the war and subsequently demolished. The village of Soupir was devastated during the war, mainly due to the Second Battle of the Aisne. There are now five national cemeteries located in the small French village - two for France, and one each for Germany, the UK, and Italy

The football which the London Irish Rifles kicked across No Mans Land on Christmas Day 1915 as they attacked the German positions in the town of Loos. The team defied orders to dribble the football as they advanced across No Man's Land while under heavy machine gun and mortar fire. Some time after the devastating battle - which resulted in 50,000 British casualties - the muddy ball was recovered from the battlefield and taken back to Britain

View from Cavernes des Dragons (Dragon's Lair) southwards over La Vallee Foulon in Aisne towards French positions. The Cavernes des Dragons - a former limestone quarry - was occupied by the Germans from 1915 and became an important strategic military point. The tiny hamlet of La-Vallee-Foulon was completely destroyed during the fighting

W Beach at Gallipoli, looking towards Tekke Burnu with a wreck of a British vessel. The ill-fated Gallipoli campaign - fought by British and French troops against the Turkish  between April 1915 and January 1916 -  saw some of the bloodiest fighting. It was widely considered a disaster for the Allies, who suffered more than 200,000 deaths - many due to disease in the inhospitable and unfamiliar domain

The exhibition recently moved to London's St James's Park and will run there until Armistice Day.

Among the striking photographs is an image of Beaumont Hamel on the Somme where the Newfoundland Regiment were decimated by German machine guns - the trenches and shell holes are still clearly visible from the air.

The collection, sponsored by The Royal British Legion, also shows the football which the London Irish Rifles kicked across No Mans Land on Sept 25th, 1915 as they attacked the German positions in the town of Loos.

There is also a picture of unexploded shells uncovered by ploughing near Munich Trench Cemetery - awaiting collection by the Bomb Squad - and a World War I observation post near Hebuterne, south of Dunkirk. 

A rainbow is captured over Messines Ridge in Belgian West Flanders. The ridge was targeted during the Battle of Messines in  1917. The offensive was launched on June 7 with the detonation of 19 underground mines in chambers along a seven-mile front. It is thought  around 6,000 German troops died in the explosions and the Ridge was quickly taken by General Sir Herbert Plumer's Second Army

A view over Gallipoli. At the height of the vicious fighting during the Gallipoli landings of April 25, 1915, the waters around the peninsula were stained red with blood. The British hoped the campaign would help them get to Constantinople and that they would link up with the Russians. The intention of this was to then knock Turkey out of the war - but it was a massive failure and resulted in huge losses

St Symphorien Cemetery just east of Mons. It was created and maintained by the Germans after the Battle of Mons in August 1914 for soldiers on both sides. The Battle was the first major action of the British Expeditionary Force against the Germans in the  War

Molleville Farm was a key position in the German defences on the Heights of Meuse, on the right wing of the American attack at Meuse-Argonne.

The hillock on the right horizon in the shot is Tel el Saba which was a Turkish artillery position taken on October 31, 1918, by the Anzac Light Horse with support from an HAC battery. This shot is taken from a ridge about 400m to the east which still has evidence of gunpits

Another image shows the Champagne Battlefield burial site memorial left intact on the Western Front with a soldier's equipment left on the grave, along with a plaque placed there by his father in 1919.

Mike, from Ireland, wanted to show how even now, a century after the war started, the landscapes are still scarred.

He said: 'This collection represents a legacy which I hope will create a gateway to the battlefields themselves.

'I want to encourage people to visit these historic landscapes during the centennial period and create an awareness and understanding of the events and historical implications of the First World War.'

The Beaumont Hamel British Cemetery in Somme viewed from Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. The two lines of graves, most of which contain unidentified soldiers' remains,  date from 1 July 1916 and early 1917 and they include a solitary German burial. Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt was a German stronghold which was attacked by the British who blew up a mine there on 1st of July 1916

On October 24, 1917, Austro-German forces launched an attack across the River Isonzo (now called Soca) via a bridgehead at Tolmin. This was one of a series of battles fought along the river on the eastern sector of the Italian Front in World War One. Now located  in Slovenia, during the war the sixty-mile long river ran north-south just inside Austria and was witness to huge casualties 

The Champagne    Battlefield grave memorial. This is probably the last soldier's battlefield burial site memorial left intact on the Western Front with the soldier's equipment left on the grave, along with a plaque placed there by his father in 1919

The churchyard of the old village of Fey-en-Haye on the outskirts of Bois le Pretre (translated literally as Priests Wood or Priesterwald in German). The woodland formed the centre point of many battles and combats from September 1914 until November 1915. During the war the little village formed a part of the French lines

The German Cemetery Tetes des Faux is situated at 1208m on a peak to the south of Weiss Valley with extensive views of the surrounding region. It was the scene of bitter fighting, but despite repeated assaults it was held by Germans who built extensive bunkers, block houses and trench systems on the hillside, supplied by funicular railways from the valley below

This image shows Belleau Wood near the Marne River in France. The Battle of Belleau Wood  occurred during the German 1918 Spring Offensive and was one of the most important battles for the US forces. Evidence of trenches, shell holes and ruined building can still be seen in the area - relics of fighting which resulted in more than 8,000 US casualties

Looking south over Hanebeek from German positions, An unexploded shell is seen lying amidst the mud of Passchendaele. The Battle of Passchendaele, or Third Battle of Ypres, was fought between July and November 1917 for control of the ridges south and east of the Belgian city of Ypres in West Flanders. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the First World War

This compass belonged to a Lt Eric Black, 24, who was an undergraduate at Keble College Oxford and commissioned into the Lincolnshire Regiment. On 9 May 1915 they attacked a position known as Rouges Bancs and Black was making his way back from the front line in the evening when he disappeared in the area of this field, where in 1992, M. Fournier the farmer found the compass

Mittel Rehfelsen  was tunnelled and fortified by the Germans during the war. The image is part of the Fields of Battle-Lands of Peace 14-18 collection - an open-air exhibition featuring 60 freestanding photographs, each measuring 1.2 metres (4ft) by 1.8 metres (5ft 10in)

This aerial image shows the landscape of Beaumont Hamel on the Somme, where the Newfoundland Regiment were decimated by German machine guns - the trenches and shell holes and wire pickets are still clearly visible, illustrating the extent of the damage

This image was taken on rocky spur, about 500m long and 1000m high. It has three sides sloping down steeply into the Weiss valley below, which was heavily fortified by the Germans in World War One and attacked furiously by the French in 1915

This photo shows unexploded shells that were uncovered by ploughing near Munich Trench Cemetery and currently awaiting collection by the Bomb Squad. The Cemetery contains the graves of 146 Allied soldiers  who died in November 1916 and January 1917

The Lochnagar crater on the 1916 Somme battlefields in France is the largest man-made mine crater created in the First World War on the Western Front. It was created by a mine laid by the British Army's 179th Tunnelling Company Royal Engineers underneath a German strongpoint called.The mine was exploded  at the launch of the British offensive against the German lines on July 1, 1916

Memorial stones to French and German dead at Le Petit Donon to mark the fighting that took place In August 1914. Following the battle the Germans buried the dead of both sides where they fell and marked them with crosses. These were replaced in 1916 by a German NCO called Ludwig Gebhardt and today 41 of these memorial stones  still sit on the upper slopes of the hill

This image shows rifle ammunition clips from the fighting. It is just one of a series of powerful and atmospheric shots taken by photographer, Michael St Maur Sheil, revealing the battlefields of World War One as they look today - a century after the fighting started

A British observation post near Hebuterne built in 1917 and overlooking Gommecourt Wood in France. The Gommecourt Wood New Cemetery includes the graves of 56 men who served with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in the First World War

A German memorial in Machault, Champagne. It sits of the site of the vanished German cemetery laid out near Fellazarett. The Champagne offensives meant this was one of the landscapes most scarred by the effects of war

The pockmarked landscape of the Ouvrage de Thiaumont battlefield close to Verdun in north eastern France, still bearing the testimony of the savage ferocity of the fighting. The Battle of Verdun in 1916 was the longest single battle of the war and was one of the reasons for the British starting the Battle of the Somme in July of the same year in an effort to take German pressure off of the French
