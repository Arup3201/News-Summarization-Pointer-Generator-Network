With Monday’s transfer deadline fast approaching, there is still plenty of talent on offer for Premier League clubs. SAMI MOKBEL runs the rule over the best players still available on the market.

Petr Cech

Club: Chelsea Age: 32

Position: Goalkeeper

Why might he move? Jose Mourinho has made Thibaut Courtois his new first-choice keeper, why would someone of Cech’s calibre accept sitting on the bench?

Who wants him? PSG and Monaco are keen. Chelsea are expecting an approach in the coming days, but Cech will have to make clear he wants out.

Danny Welbeck

Club: Man Utd Age: 23

Position: Forward

Why might he move? He wants to stay at Old Trafford but has been told he can leave by manager Louis van Gaal.

Who wants him? Arsenal, Tottenham and Hull. Welbeck has no intention of leaving for Hull, but would seriously consider a move to either north London club.

Tom Cleverley

Club: Man Utd Age: 25

Position: Midfielder

Why might he move? The England international does not feature in Van Gaal’s plans and must move before Monday’s deadline.

Who wants him? Aston Villa and Valencia. Paul Lambert has already had an £8million offer accepted so it’s now up to the player.

James McArthur 

Club: Wigan Age: 26

Position: Midfielder

Why might he move? Because moves to the top flight do not come around all that often, so when it does arrive you have to grasp it.

Who wants him? Leicester have had a £7million bid accepted and Burnley are keen, but Crystal Palace have also thrown their hat into the ring.

Moving up: Wigan midfielder James McArthur has been linked with a move to the Premier League

Radamel Falcao

Club: Monaco Age: 28

Position: Striker

Why might he move? Just a season into his stay, Monaco are prepared to let him depart and the striker is also up for leaving.

Who wants him? Real Madrid have met with his representatives over a move to Spain, but the £20million loan fee is a stumbling block. Arsenal could also show late interest.

William Carvalho

Club: Sporting Lisbon Age: 22

Position: Midfielder

Why might he move? He is viewed as one of the best emerging midfield talents in Europe and has a £37million release clause. If a club is willing to pay, he will go.

Who wants him? Manchester United and Arsenal are set to battle it out for the midfielder. It’s a big call for Carvalho.

Arturo Vidal

Club: Juventus Age: 27

Position: Midfielder

Why might he move? Manchester United are set to make a late charge for the Chilean. Juventus aren’t in a rush to sell but if United come up with the money then he could go.

Who wants him? United are the club furthest advanced in their interest so if he leaves, it’s likely to be to Old Trafford.

Sandro

Club: Tottenham Age: 25

Position: Midfielder

Why might he move? Tottenham need to balance the books after spending heavily and the Brazil midfielder has found himself on the sidelines with new manager Mauricio Pochettino preferring Nabil Bentaleb and Etienne Capoue.

Who wants him? Serie A club Napoli have pursued Sandro all summer but they can no longer offer him Champions League football after losing in qualification.

Fabio Borini

Club: Liverpool Age: 23

Position: Forward

Why might he move? The purchase of Mario Balotelli has pushed him further down the Anfield pecking order and he got a taste for first-team football during last season’s loan spell at Sunderland.

Who wants him? Gus Poyet liked what he saw last season and has been pushing for a permanent deal all summer. However, reports in Italy say AC Milan are keen.
