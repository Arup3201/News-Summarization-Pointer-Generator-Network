England's Under 21s credentials for Euro 2015 will be given another serious examination when they contest a glamour friendly against Germany.

The FA have made a conscious decision to play better opposition in the build up to next summer’s tournament and that has been borne out with games this month against Portugal – at Burnley on Thursday– and France in Brest on Monday.

And the next round of internationals in March will see them lock horns with Germany at Middlesbrough on Monday, March 30.

Despite tough tests lying in wait, England boss Gareth Southgate admitted the match against Germany would provide vital experience for his team.

Southgate said: 'There is so much history to this fixture but we also know at development level, Germany have really got so much right over the last few years.

'For us it’s a great bench mark and we’ve had some good games against Germany recently at other age groups so we want to keep challenging ourselves. We feel that playing top quality opposition will provide a vital learning experience. 

Germany have also qualified for Euro 2015 and are among the favourites to win it.

The last time England’s Under 21s played at The Riverside Stadium was in February 2012, when they beat Belgium 4-0.

At a time when England's senior team is still trying to win back the faith of the public following a horror show at the 2014 World Cup, it's refreshing to see one Three Lions side on a winning run.

The England Under 21 squad are on an incredible 10-match winning sequence and have been training ahead of their  meeting with Portugal as they attempt to increase that number to 11.

Tottenham striker Harry Kane was among those featuring in the session at St George's Park, along with Burnley hitman Danny Ings.

Southgate's confident Young Lions team will look to take advantage of a scouting opportunity ahead of next summer's Under 21 European Championship.

The Portuguese will provide perfect opposition for Gareth Southgate's side in a friendly at Turf Moor on Thursday, with the two sides having been drawn in the same group ahead of next summer's finals in the Czech Republic.

Sweden and Italy are also in England's group, leaving Southgate's team with a tough task to clear the group stages having failed in their previous two tournament appearances under the management of Stuart Pearce.

England went unbeaten throughout their qualifying campaign, topping their group after winning nine of their 10 matches before defeating Croatia home and away in a play-off to reach the finals.

Goalkeepers: Marcus Bettinelli (Fulham), Jonathan Bond (Watford), Jack Butland (Derby).

Defenders: Luke Garbutt (Everton), Ben Gibson (Middlesbrough), Carl Jenkinson (West Ham), Michael Keane (Burnley), Jamaal Lascelles (Nottingham Forest), Liam Moore (Leicester City), Jack Robinson (Huddersfield).

Midfielders: Tom Carroll (Swansea City), Nathaniel Chalobah (Burnley), Jake Forster-Caskey (Brighton), Will Hughes (Derby), Thomas Ince (Nottingham Forest), Alex Pritchard (Brentford), Nathan Redmond (Norwich).

Forwards: Patrick Bamford (Middlesbrough), Harry Kane (Tottenham), Danny Ings (Burnley), Callum Wilson (Bournemouth), Cauley Woodrow (Fulham).

It's the first of two friendlies for England with Southgate's team then travelling to Brittany for a match with France on Monday.

Southgate's team features a couple of new faces. With Saido Berahino called into the senior squad, Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson, who has scored nine goals in the Championship this season, comes into the fold.

There is also a first England call for Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli. 

Southgate was also full or praise for former club Middlesbrough ahead of the Portugal game, highlighting the strides made at the club and how it's helping produce English talent.

'With Middlesbrough going as well as they are, there is a good feeling up there and I think they are going to be really strong contenders for promotion. Aitor [Karanka] is doing a really good job.

'He has been very supportive of what we are doing and really helpful with Ben [Gibson], Patrick [Bamford] and Jamal Blackman as well as boys at other age groups. Historically, Middlesbrough have been a great provider of young players for us but that’s continuing now.'
