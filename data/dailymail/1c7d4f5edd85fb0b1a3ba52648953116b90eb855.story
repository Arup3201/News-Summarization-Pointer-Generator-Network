A rare diary which was the first hand account of one of the victims of the brutal Khmer Rouge in Cambodia was used to bring its last remaining leaders to justice.

School inspector Poch Younly kept the secret diary nearly 40 years ago, which vividly recounts the horrors of the radical communist regime.

Their experiment in social engineering claimed the lives of 1.7million people through overwork, medical neglect, starvation and execution.

It is thought Mr Poch wrote his entries while hunched on the floor of the wood and leaf hut as he was forced to live away from his family and hid the diary inside a clay vase as anybody educated was deemed a threat to the regime and executed.

In one of the spiral bound notebook's last pages, he wrote: 'Why is it that I have to die here like a cat or a dog ... without any reason, without any meaning?'

Now it has emerged that Mr Poch's diary was part of the vast case file, which helped to convict the only two surviving Khmer Rouge leaders, 83-year-old former president Khieu Samphan and 88-year-old Nuon Chea, the right hand man of the group's infamous late leader Pol Pot.

Last Thursday, a UN-backed tribunal sentenced both men to life in prison for crimes against humanity - a verdict that many believe was too little, and far too late.

Written in Khmer, the diary fills about 100 pages and is divided into two sections.

The first summarises Mr Poch's family history, an era spanning French colonial rule, the Japanese occupation during the Second World War and his arranged marriage to his then 15-year-old wife.

The rest, written as a letter addressed to his children, describes life under the Khmer Rouge and is dated only at the start and the end - February 9 and July 29, 1976, with a final post-script entered a few days later.

When Khmer Rouge forces seized Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, Mr Poch and his wife were living with eight of their children in a rural town called Kampong Chhnang.

Three days later, the guerrillas arrived and residents - including Mr Poch - cheered, relieved the war was finally over, his 86-year-old widow Som Seng Eath recalled.

But within hours, the Khmer Rouge were emptying Cambodia's cities, marching millions of people into the countryside to work as manual laborers.

Mr Poch said how he 'didn't believe what was happening' and kept saying, `Don't worry, we'll be back soon, don't pack much,' his widow said.

His notebook recounts how he was marched through forests and mountains for nearly two weeks.

Along the way, most of his possessions were confiscated, including four of the notebooks and a prized camera he had bought during a government visit to inspect schools in the United States in 1961.

Ominously, he began hearing talk of execution sites ahead - what would later become known as Cambodia's killing fields.

In his diary he wrote: 'We worked day and night clearing wood to make arable land, uprooting the trees, digging canals, building roads and dikes, planting vegetables and digging ponds.

'We worked 10 to 13 hours a day.'

Food supplies dwindled, and Mr Poch and his wife grew so desperate they traded clothes and a treasured family locket for salt, sugar and medicine.

The following month, he fell ill and he could not work, but he had the privacy to write.

But months later, he began sensing his end was near.

'By now, my body resembles a corpse, thin with only skin and bones,' he wrote.

'I have no energy, and my hands and legs tremble. No power, no strength. I cannot walk far or do heavy work. Everyone works like animals, like machines, without any value, without hope for the future.'

At one point, he writes of his regret at not being able to see all of his children as his two oldest sons were elsewhere in the country.

The rest were forced to live in other parts of the village, working in mobile children's work units.

'Let me die,' he continued. 'Let my destiny take me wherever it goes ... My children, I miss you; I love you.'

Mr Poch wrote until there were no pages left to write on, his wife said.

On August 1, 1976, he wrote a postscript on the final page, asking his family to take care of the diary.

Hours later, he was taken away by the regime to help lift a palm tree that had fallen in a paddy field.

However, it was a lie as authorities had come to arrest him because one of his sons had attempted to exchange an Omega watch Mr Poch had bought in America 15 years earlier for fermented fish.

Mr Poch died several weeks later, in a nearby prison where he was kept chained to the ground.

His widow says the diary is too painful to read now and says she didn't understand its importance at the time.

She kept the diary safe for two decades, then passed it on to one of her daughters.

It was the daughter's husband who suggested giving the notebook to a documentation centre to protect the fragile, yellowed pages of history.

It is 'the story of all of us who survived,' said Youk Chhang, who runs the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, which has amassed millions of documents, photographs, films and verbal testimonies from the Khmer Rouge era.

'When the Khmer Rouge were in charge, everything belonged to the revolution, he added. 'You owned nothing. Not even your life story.'
