Anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee has been returned to his cell in a Guatemalan detention center after he rushed to a hospital over fears that he had suffered a heart attack.

McAfee, 67, said that he was suffering from chest pains overnight but didn't think it was a heart attack.

A doctor who looked him over him did not think it was a heart attack either, telling the Associated Press that McAfee's heart rhythm and blood pressure were normal and that he appeared to be suffering only from high stress.

McAfee appeared unresponsive as reporters and photographers followed the stretcher into the emergency room.

ABC News reported that as medical personnel moved McAfee to a bed and began to remove his clothes, he abruptly spoke up, saying, 'Please, not in front of the press.'

Later on Thursday, however, McAfee was escorted back to his jail cell.

The software company founder was denied political asylum in Guatemala and his lawyers said they were making a last-ditch effort to keep him from being flown back to Belize for questioning about the killing of a fellow American expatriate.

McAfee was moved from an immigration center to a police-run hospital Thursday afternoon after Guatemalan authorities said McAfee's request for asylum had been rejected.

They did not explain why. Shortly after the decision was announced, McAfee issued a plea on his blog for the public to petition Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina to let him stay.

'Please email the President of 
Guatemala and beg him to allow the court system to proceed, to determine
my status in Guatemala, and please support the political asylum that I 
am asking for,' the post read.

McAfee's lawyer vowed to block Guatemalan efforts to remove the entrepreneur.

McAfee was not taken to a hospital and posted on his blog during the morning hours.

'I don't think a heart attack prevents one from using one's blog,' said the lawyer, Telesforo Guerra.

McAfee was detained by Guatemalan police on Wednesday for illegally sneaking across the border with his 20-year-old girlfriend to escape authorities in Belize. He has said he fears authorities in Belize will kill him if he returns.

Still, Guatemala's foreign minister, Harold Caballeros, said McAfee's request for asylum had been rejected.

Police in Belize want to quiz McAfee as 'a person of interest' in the killing of fellow American Gregory Faull, with whom he had quarreled.

But they say he is not a prime suspect in the probe. McAfee says he has been persecuted by Belize's ruling party because he refused to pay it around $2 million.

Belize's prime minister denies this and has described McAfee, who made millions from the Internet anti-virus software that bears his name, as 'bonkers.' McAfee later lost much of his fortune and turned to a life of semi-reclusion by the beach.

During an exclusive interview with the AP Thursday morning from inside his private room at the center, McAfee said he was refusing to travel to a hospital because he had been using Chinese herbal medicine since suffering a heart attack in 1993.

'Last night I had a little bit of pain, but I am fine this morning,' he said. 'I don't like Western medicine ... if the people around me are kind and compassionate, that's all that matters in life. The people of Guatemala are very kind people, so I have no complaints.'

A couple of hours later, an AP reporter returned to McAfee's room and found him changed into a suit but lying on the floor as he was examined by a doctor. Shortly after, he was taken to the police hospital.

Belizean police spokesman Raphael Martinez said officials expected McAfee to be flown back to his country's capital.

Police want to question him about the fatal shooting of killing of Gregory Viant Faull, who was shot to death in early November on the Belize island where both men lived.

Guerra wants to lodge an injunction against McAfee's arrest and said he should not be moved from the immigration shelter where he is staying until doctors had cleared his health.

They had drawn blood and results are expected later on Thursday.

After his arrest, McAfee spent the night in a cottage belonging to the immigration department.

He passed much of the night reading his blog www.whoismcafee.com and posting his thoughts on a laptop he said was lent to him by the warden.

One person asked him if he felt like committing suicide.

'I enjoy living, and suicide is absurdly redundant,' he wrote. 'The world, from the very beginning, hurls viruses, accidents, hungry animals, defective DNA - and uncountable more - in an attempt to kill us. It always succeeds. Suicide is simply aiding and abetting.'

McAfee's earlier posts spoke of his relief at arriving in Guatemala, thinking he had found a way out of his troubles.

Government spokesman Francisco Cuevas said on Wednesday the eccentric tech entrepreneur, who loves guns and young women and has tribal tattoos covering his shoulders, would be expelled to Belize within hours.

However, an immigration department official later said immediate deportation had been ruled out.

On the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye, where McAfee has lived in Belize for about four years, residents and neighbors say he is eccentric and at times unstable.

He was seen to travel with armed bodyguards, sporting a pistol tucked into his belt.

The predicament of the former Lockheed systems consultant is a far cry from his heyday in the late 1980s, when he started McAfee Associates.

McAfee has no relationship now with the company, which was sold to Intel Corp.

McAfee was previously charged in Belize with possession of illegal firearms, and police had raided his property on suspicions that he was running a lab to produce illegal synthetic narcotics.

He says he has not taken drugs since 1983.

'(Before then) I took drugs constantly, 24 hours of the day. I took them for years and years. I was the worst drug abuser on the planet,' he told Reuters before his arrest.

'Then I finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, and that was the end of it.'
