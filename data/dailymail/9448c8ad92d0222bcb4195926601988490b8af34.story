The teenage daughter
of actress Meera Syal burst into tears yesterday as she was cleared of 
glassing a male model at a garden party.

Chameli
Bhatia, 19, had been accused of launching a vicious attack on Christian
Pannell at a party thrown by former classmates from the £14,000-a year 
private school they had both attended.

But
she was cleared after the jury heard claims that the victim’s father 
had threatened to take her actress mother ‘to the cleaners’.

Ordeal over: Meera Syal and her daughter Chameil Bhatia leave Snaresbrook Crown Court yesterday

The model had claimed Miss Bhatia had
pushed the glass he was carrying into his face ‘with some force’ – 
leaving him requiring surgery and 14 stitches for cuts to his cheek and 
eyelids.

But a jury accepted Miss Bhatia’s 
account that it was a ‘horrible accident’ and took less than an hour to 
clear her of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Miss Bhatia, known as Milli, the 
daughter of Miss Syal and her first husband, journalist Shekhar Bhatia, 
wept as the jury found her not guilty. 
Miss Syal, 50, who was awarded an MBE in 1997, hugged her actor husband Sanjeev Bhaskar, 48, when the verdict was announced.

Unfortunate: Model Christian Pannell, pictured leaving court during the trial, needed 14 stitches for cuts to his cheek and eyelid after being injured on September 19 last year

She is known to millions as a star of
the BBC comedy series The Kumars at No 42 and  as the author of novels 
including Anita and Me.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that on
September 18, Mr Pannell and Miss Bhatia attended a garden party thrown
by two former  schoolmates from Forest School,  in Walthamstow, 
North-East  London.

It was claimed by the  prosecution that Miss Bhatia 
bore a grudge against Mr Pannell, 19, for splitting up with her friend 
two weeks previously.

Afterwards, Bhatia, who was arrested 
at her home in Woodford, East London, texted Pannell to say: ‘I meant to
flip your drink as a joke but I think my ring hit your glass which made
it shatter.’

Giving evidence in her daughter’s 
defence, Miss Syal said Christian’s father, John Pannell, was ‘enraged’ 
during a phone call the following day. 

She said: ‘I said to him “it 
sounds like a horrible accident” and that’s when he became very 
aggressive. 

‘He said “this was no accident, your daughter attacked my son”.’

In a second conversation an hour later, Miss Syal said she was threatened with legal action. 

‘He said “We are going to prosecute your daughter, we are going to take you to the cleaners. Your daughter attacked my son”.’

As Mr Pannell and his son stormed out
of court, the former  nightclub manager said: ‘Let’s go. It’s not worth
sitting here – it’s a bloody joke.’
