San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has branded a story that he is being investigated for a possible sexual assault 'completely wrong'.

The football player, 26, spoke out in a series of Twitter messages on Friday, a day after it emerged he was being investigated because he was named in a police report earlier this month.

The report, filed by an ex, said Kaepernick kissed and undressed her during a night of drinking and smoking marijuana before she woke up in hospital without any memories of what had happened.

While she was in hospital the following morning, a rape kit was administered, TMZ reported, but the results have not been shared.

While no charges have been filed and the report did not alleged any specific crimes, a news story by TMZ said police sources said the sports star was being investigated for possible sexual assault.

Anger: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, pictured in 2010, says stories have been 'made up' about him being under investigation for a possible sexual assault

'The charges made in the TMZ story and
 other stories Iâ€™ve seen are completely wrong,' Kaepernick said on his 
Twitter account. 'They make things up about me that never happened.

'I take great pride in who I am and what I do, but  I guess sometimes you have to deal with someone who makes things up.

'I want to thank all of the people who have shared their encouraging sentiments. I assure you that your faith is not misplaced.'

But on Friday, TMZ refused to back down, saying that a 'well placed official' said that the investigation is 'sexual in nature'.

On Thursday it emerged that Miami police are looking into the 'suspicious incident' after an unnamed woman said she kissed Kaepernick and undressed after a night drinking and smoking marijuana with him and two other 49ers. She later woke up in hospital without any memory.

Speaking out: Kaepernick responded to the reports in a series of tweets posted on Friday morning

Named: It comes after Kaepernick was named in a police report filed in Miami by an ex earlier this month

The report notes that she had a 'sexual relationship with Mr. Kaepernick in the past'.

The
 woman said she visited Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette,
 27, at an apartment in the Viceroy, a luxury hotel that has rooms and 
residences, and he was there with Kaepernick and 49ers wide receiver 
Quinton Patton, 23, according to a police report.

After
 mixing some drinks for the men and giving them shots, they allegedly 
told her that for them to take the shots, she had to smoke marijuana.

They
 all started watching a basketball game but the woman said that she went
 to a bedroom to lie down after feeling 'light headed', according to the
 report.

Kaepernick 
then came into the bedroom and kissed her and undressed her, leaving her
 naked - before walking out and saying he would return.

Friends: Ricardo Lockette, right with Kaepernick left, was also at the hotel the night of the incident

She was waiting in bed naked when the two other players peeked inside the room, the report said.

'What are you doing?' she shouted at them, according to the report. 'Where is Colin? Get out!'

The men then left - and she cannot remember what happened after that, she said.

But
 she woke up in a hospital bed in the middle of the night and 'doesn't 
remember how she got there or who transported her to the hospital', the 
report said.

'There's no evidence of a crime or a sexual assault,' a police spokesperson said of the report. 'This report is simply an incident report taken at the woman's request.'

According to Kapernick's Instagram 
account, he is in Miami to train and has been to the Viceroy Hotel as 
recently as April 5, where he was pictured hanging out with a wedding 
party by the pool.

Kaepernick,
 who has previously been rumored to be dating 23-year-old singer and 
actress Teyana Taylor, is up for a possible contract extension this 
summer.

'The 49ers organization is aware of 
the recent media report regarding Colin Kaepernick and is in the process
 of gathering the pertinent facts,' the team said in a statment said.

Over
 the past two seasons, he has played with the 49ers in the Super Bowl 
and the NFC Championship game - although the team lost both.
