Louis van Gaal looks increasingly like the man who gets things done. And while that may be good news for Manchester United, it is causing something of a stir in Holland.

The new Manchester United manager could not have wished for a better showcase to demonstrate his tactical credentials than this World Cup. This week he has been conducting open training sessions at the Netherlands headquarters in the wealthy Ipanema district of Rio.

Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder are using the facilities of Flamengo, a club that is cross between Manchester United, in being the most popular in Brazil, and Chelsea, in attracting the richest and most well-to-do fans.

Chatty: Van Persie and Kuyt having a discussion in training

Their training ground, on the edge of 
the picturesque lake that characterises this part of the city, is 
overlooked by some of the most-expensive apartments in Rio — there is no
 such thing as a closed training session here — and the mountains and 
the iconic statue of Christ the Redeemer provide an extraordinary 
backdrop.

Ironically this 
week they received a visit from Flamengo’s most-famous player, Zico, the
 man remembered as one of the principal creative architects of the 
glorious, if flawed, Brazil side of 1982.

For whilst Van Gaal may be 
surrounded by opulence and grandeur, he is developing a reputation as 
something of a grafter. And glorious failure is not a theme he is 
inclined to embrace.

With a 
Dutch side that many thought weak, old and deficient in quality, 
compared to the great teams of the past, Van Gaal has set about devising
 a plan that has brought best out the players and, if they can beat 
Mexico in Fortaleza today, looks likely to take them to the semi-finals 
at least.

There are problems
 associated with the unexpected success. Van Persie aside, Manchester 
United players will be missing out on his tactical insights.

They return
 to training on Friday, whilst Van Gaal is likely to be detained at this
 tournament until the final weekend, meaning he would only join up with 
his new club on the eve of their departure for their US tour in late 
July.

And Van Gaal, a man 
not unused to confrontation, is causing a furore in Holland. His great 
crime? Not playing 4-3-3 in the best tradition of the Dutch football.

It
 seems strange that the country that gave the world the flexibility of 
Total Football is now so wedded to that idea they can conceive no other 
way to play the game and even the 5-1 victory over Spain, known in 
Holland as ‘the miracle of Salvador,’ has not won Van Gaal any 
disciples.

For a nation that
 prides itself on domination of the ball, the fact that Holland have 
only controlled possession in one game so far — and that against 
Australia, where they only managed 52 per cent — and, even worse, are 
scoring from long balls and counter attacks, is enough to cause an 
identity crisis.

The great 
high priest of Dutch football, Johan Cruyff, the leader of the Total 
Football team from the 1970s, has come out against Van Gaal’s playing 
style, despite the 10 goals scored. So now famous names are now rallying
 to Van Gaal’s cause.

The circle: Van Gaal addresses his players during the session

Ruud Gullit, the 1987 European Footballer of the 
Year, is the perhaps the most important, comparing the tactics to those 
that won Holland their last trophy, the 1988 European Championships.

‘I completely support the realistic approach of Louis van Gaal,’ wrote Gullit in his newspaper column yesterday.

‘The
 70s men, the icons of Dutch football, long for the great football they 
played. But they use the fact they were such great teams and had such a 
great playing style as a cover for fact they never won anything. Holland
 were beaten in every final.

‘I
 remember going into Euro ‘88 and our first group game against Soviet 
Union was one of the best matches I’ve ever played in — but we lost.

'After that we sat down with Rinus Michels and we changed it round to 
play a more realistic game. We changed the system and against England in
 the group stages, I was played as a left winger.

‘From
 then on we were on a high all our way to the final. In the final itself
 I even had to do a job on making sure their playmaker, Oleksiy 
Mykhaylychenko, didn’t get in the game.

'I scored from a header in the 
box and though our playing style wasn’t the prettiest, we were European 
Champions and we got the respect for being champions.

‘Football
 has evolved, which means that nowadays you have to be cleverer, more 
realistic and sly to survive in big international games. In Dutch 
football we are often lacking this realistic approach. But Van Gaal’s 
Holland has been a massive example of this new awareness in the World 
Cup in Brazil.

'Holland have scored 10 goals so far in the first round. 
Well, if that is achieved with so-called defensive football, I don’t 
know how people expect us to shake off that label.’

Cooling off: The team stop for a drink in the scorching conditions of Fortaleza

The
 significance of his comments is that the late Michels, who led the 
Netherlands in that tournament, was also coach to the great Ajax team of
 the early 1970s and the 1974 national team and was mentor to Cruyff.

If
 even the father of Total Football could be functional and have the 
world’s greatest player, as Gullit was in those days, parked out on the 
left wing, then Van Gaal must be allowed to evolve a style that works 
for his, less-talented players

But
 Dutch football is an earnest business and split along sectarian lines. You are either with Cruyff or with Van Gaal.

The pair have no time for 
each other even though they both come out of the same tradition of 
passing football at Ajax and even though both laid the foundations for 
the current playing style of Barcelona, Van Gaal taking over shortly 
after Cruyff left the Catalan club.

Like a religious split, it is 
baffling to outsiders yet those caught up within it are faced with 
choosing one man or the other as their mentor and philosophical guide.

And
 Van Gaal, who made his name with the superb Ajax side of 1995 that 
dominated possession and passed the ball beautifully, has shown a 
greater capacity to adapt his ideals and hence has proved a better coach
 than Cruyff.

Even at this World Cup, he has proved flexible, switching 
the system at half time against Australia to turn the game around.

Despite
 the £65million spent on Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw, and the moves 
imminent for Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mats Hummels, United may need 
some of that tactical acumen to coax the best from limited players.

Lining one up: Van Gaal getting stuck in with the ball at his feet

Indeed,
 Premier League fans might have raised a quizzical eyebrow at Aston 
Villa’s Ron Vlaar as the pivotal defender for Holland, or Norwich City’s
 Leroy Fer as a key substitute, scoring a great goal against Chile.

Van
 Gaal’s greatest triumph though has been reviving Wesley Sneijder. It 
had seemed as though the star of the 2010 team, which reached the World 
Cup final before truly betraying their roots by trying to kick Spain off
 the pitch, had no chance of making even the squad.

Van Gaal had pronounced him unfit and surplus to requirements during qualifying, causing enormous friction between the two.

Yet
 Sneijder, once in contention to be the best player in the world, hired 
Henk van Cate, the former Chelsea coach, to get him fit and has 
transformed himself into the team’s workhorse, statistics showing that 
he has run the most miles of anyone in the squad in the first two games.
 Given the former animosity between manager and player, his willingness 
to conform has been remarkable.

‘I’ve
 had my moment with the manager,’ said Sniejder. ‘But I have to say that
 in this World Cup he’s getting it right all the time and so far there 
hasn’t been anything to find fault with.

‘The
 tactical work is something different to what we’ve done before. His 
vision and tactics have given confidence to everyone in the squad. It’s a
 joy to work with him and I have no reason to complain.’

As
 for Van Gaal himself, he is unapologetic. His view is that, having lost
 his best midfielder to injury in Kevin Strootman, he is making the best
 of what he has.

‘I lost 
Kevin Strootman and I had to think of something different,’ he said. 
‘And I set up the system with specific players in my possession. I have 
come here to win not to entertain the world.’ He may end up doing both.
