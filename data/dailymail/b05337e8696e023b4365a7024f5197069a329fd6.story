A prison psychologist has been deregistered after pursuing a relationship with an inmate who was doing 21 years behind bars for murder.

Bobbie Bergmeier met the inmate - who can be referred to only as Client A - after she began working as a psychologist at Junee Correctional Centre in the NSW Riverina region in April 2010.

At the time, Client A was serving the final years of his 21-year sentence for murder and malicious wounding.

The Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) alleges Ms Bergmeier began intimate telephone conversations with him, declaring ‘she loved him and couldn't wait to be with him’ and ‘he was sexy and she wanted him forever’.

She resigned from the prison job in August 2011 but continued to stay in contact with him, visiting his family and friends, and applying to be his sponsor for weekend leave.

In an attempt to cover up the relationship, Ms Bergmeier used a colleague's password to log into Client A's case notes and change them to create ‘distance’ between herself and him, the HCCC alleged.

In a judgment handed down on Wednesday, the Civil and Administrative Tribunal NSW found her guilty of professional misconduct, saying she ‘has been involved in a serious boundary violation and placed her client at risk’.

The tribunal said Client A had been in jail all of his adult life with little opportunity to explore relationships and was described as ‘needy and dependent and psychologically vulnerable’.

When asked why she didn't end the relationship when the stakes were so high, Ms Bergmeier told the tribunal her feelings were ‘so strong’ that she didn't think to.

Ms Bergmeier said she accepted responsibility for her actions and acknowledged that what she did was wrong and understood her conduct had breached her professional code of ethics.

The tribunal cancelled her registration, saying: ‘Her insight into the seriousness of her conduct and its impact on her client, her colleagues and the profession as a whole remains questionable.’

Client A was released on parole in March and it is believed the pair are continuing to see each other.

Ms Bergmeier is now enrolled in a degree in primary school teaching at Charles Sturt University.
