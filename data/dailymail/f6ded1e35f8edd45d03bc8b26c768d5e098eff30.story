A middle-class mother of three stole more than £30,000 from her bosses to fund chronic eating binges.

Susan Foxcroft, 47, spent more than £100 each day gorging on sandwiches, sweets and drinks.

She told a court she had suffered from severe bulimia and anorexia for 16 years and that she had become trapped in a spiral of bingeing and purging.

Jailed: Mother of three Susan Foxcroft said she had diverted cash from her company because she did not want her husband to find out about her eating disorder

Foxcroft claimed she took the money to keep the disorder hidden from her husband.

She was able to transfer large sums into her bank account because she worked as a book-keeper at the firm.

Yesterday she was branded ‘thoroughly 
dishonest’ by a judge who sentenced her to three and a half years in 
jail.

Judge Patrick Field QC said that, although she had admitted two 
counts of fraud, she had shown no remorse.

He added: ‘I have plenty of 
sympathy for you and for your eating disorder but it constitutes no 
excuse whatsoever for what you have done.’

Foxcroft, whose children are grown-up,
lived with her husband, Jonathan, 49, in a smart £240,000 detached home
in Rossendale, Lancashire.

Fraud: Foxcroft forged letters from her boss at Welding Engineers (Mersey) Ltd to cover up her crimes

She oversaw the finances at Welding Engineers in Manchester, which makes and installs industrial doors.

Manchester Crown Court heard she began
using bank transfers and company cheques to siphon off money. Between 
2009 and 2011 she took a total of £31,302, leaving the firm with dire 
financial problems.

John Richards, defending, said: ‘She’s been suffering from severe bulimia and anorexia for 16 years.

Further damage: Foxcroft sent Mr Austin threatening texts and falsely claimed that the firm had been dodging taxes, sparking an investigation into the company

‘She has confidence and self-image 
problems, and most importantly, as regards the commission of this 
offence, she tells me she was spending upwards of £100 a day on food.’

Foxcroft, was exposed only when 
bankruptcy proceedings against her led to an investigation of her 
finances.

When the Insolvency Service questioned her about large 
deposits into her accounts she claimed that the cash payments were 
‘bonuses.’  In a bid to support the lie she forged a series of  letters 
from managing director Stephen Austin which corroborated the claim.

She 
also sent a series of threatening text messages to Mr Austin and 
intercepted his mail in a desperate attempt to cover her tracks.

Mr Austin found out about the extent 
of the fraud after a letter from the Insolvency Service eventually found
its way through to him.

When Foxcroft was caught out, she falsely 
claimed the firm had been dodging taxes, triggering an investigation 
into the company.

The court heard staff pay at Welding 
Engineers had been frozen because of the loss of money. The firm also 
spent around four months of man hours investigating the fraud and its 
impact.

The court also heard Foxcroft had already been spared jail for stealing £6,000 from a previous employer.

After being sacked, Foxcroft worked for a time as a TV extra.
