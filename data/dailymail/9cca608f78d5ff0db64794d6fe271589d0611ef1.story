A woman just released from the hospital after losing both arms, an eye, and an ear to her three pet pit bulls has now lent her voice in support of an ordinance that would toughen controls of the breed in her area.

Linda Henry of Westwego, Louisiana, was nearly ripped apart May 12 when three of her four pet pit bulls, a breed commonly known for their ferocious temperament, brutally attacked her within inches of her life.

Now out of the hospital, the still shell-shocked 54-year-old says she supports a Westwego lawmaker’s attempts to put stiff restrictions on the breed through a city ordinance.

Change of heart: Linda Henry was ripped apart by her three pit bulls, losing both her arms and nearly her life, and now she supports strict legislation covering the breed

Henry recalled her brutal ordeal exclusively to WGNO Thursday.

‘They just grabbed me,’ she recalled solemnly, her head wrapped in gauze. ‘One grabbed this arm and the other grabbed the other arm and they just pulled me down and I was screaming and hollering.’

The bites exposed the bone of her limbs and skull as she screamed for help.

‘They grab my left leg and rip all that up then they tried to get my eye ball out.’ Henry said. ‘They ripped my eye lids off, they bit my lip then they grabbed my head.’ she said.

Tragic: Here Henry sits with her common law husband at their Westwego, Louisiana home. Clarence Allen says he never wants a pit bull again, though the family once owned four or more

Thankfully, a neighbor heard Henry’s cries and called police. What officials and relatives found was shocking.

‘Her eyeball was gone,’ Cardell Henry, Linda’s nephew, told WGNO.

And what the victim’s sister saw was just as unreal. ‘With the skin ripped open and fell to the front of her face. All of this was straight up skull,’ Elaine Hamilton told the New Orleans CBS affiliate.

Henry survived surgery, but both her arms had to be amputated.

Inspired by Henry’s ordeal, Westwego City Councilman Glen Green wants to make sure her harrowing tale is the last of its kind in his town.

Then & Now: At right is Henry prior to the attacks by 3 of her pit bulls that left her missing an ear, an eye, and part of her skull, right

He says his ordinance, which is still being drafted, isn’t anti-pit bull but rather a means of ensuring that circumstances like those that led up to Henry’s attack by educating dog owners.

However, many locals disagree.

‘Some people have called for it; some people have called and written against it,’ said Mayor John Shaddinger.

Opponents have even started a petition against the proposed ordinance, which is scheduled for a July review.

Dangerous beauty: Pit bulls, like the one pictured, have a troubled history with people. The proposed Westwego legislation is one of many proposed and passed laws governing ownership of the dog in America

‘All of these people submitting petitions did not get to see Linda Henry after that dog attack, Green told WGNO. ‘Had they seen this lady or went to visit her in the hospital like I did I probably wouldn’t be getting very many petitions.’

One proponent of the ordinance is a man who visited Henry more than most.

‘I never want another pit bull,’ said Linda’s common law husband Clarence Allen, ‘ because of what happened here.’
