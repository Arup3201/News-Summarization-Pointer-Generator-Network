A sleepy owl managed to blend in on a beach after it was blown off course by strong winds.

The bird was spotted catching a few rays on a beach near Walvis Bay in Namibia, south Africa.

The African scops owl - measuring just 15cm in length - was caught on camera by beachgoer Anja Denker.

It can be seen gazing wearily at the camera, before succumbing to tiredness and closing its eyes.

It perfectly blends in with the sand thanks to its camouflage and small size - hiding it from potential predators.

'The owl was completely out of its normal habitat, but it was so well camouflaged you could hardly see it,' said Ms Denker.

'To find an owl on a beach is just a little bit unreal. My main worry was that it would be eaten by dogs or jackals or driven over by a car.

'But when I went back the next day the owl was gone and I found no sign of foul play, such as a heap of feathers - so hopefully, it was fine.'

Ms Denker, 43, had been walking along the waterfront when she spotted the owl flying overhead, before diving into the sand.

'I struggled to see exactly where it had landed as it blended in so well with its surroundings,' she said.

'However, after a while I was able to locate it and approached slowly and carefully to within a few metres.

'I was totally stunned and amazed to see that it was an African scops owl.

'I lay flat on my stomach about five metres away from it, enabling me to take some really nice ground-level shots and it appeared to be really relaxed.'

Away from home: African scops owls, found in woodlands across sub-Saharn Africa, are normally nocturnal

African scops owls, found in 
woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa, are usually nocturnal.

They mainly feed on insects, such as grasshoppers, moths and crickets - but occasionally consume spiders, scorpions and small vertebrates.

As part of their camouflage, they have the ability to extend their ear tufts so that they resemble tree branches.
