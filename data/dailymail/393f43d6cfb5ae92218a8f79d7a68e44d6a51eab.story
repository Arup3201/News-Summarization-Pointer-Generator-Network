Criticism: Hackney MP Diane Abbott, pictured today, has been accused of disrespect after tweeting from inside Tony Benn's funeral

Labour MP Diane Abbott was criticised today after she live tweeted from inside Tony Benn's funeral.

The politician sent a series of messages to her 63,000 followers as she waited for the service to start at St Margaret's church in Westminster.

Her running commentary led to be her being branded disrespectful, a 'prat' and 'tacky and horrible'.

Left-wing firebrand Tony Benn, who spent more than 50 years as an MP, died two weeks ago aged 88.

Around
 750 politicians and public figures, including Cherie Blair, Labour 
leader Ed Miliband and  Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness,  
paid their last respects at an emotional service in Westminster's St Margaret's, known as 'the parish church of the House of Commons'.

As they gathered Diane Abbott tweeted a picture of the order of service and said she was sat 
behind Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and next to former Home Secretary Jack
 Straw.

'In St Margaret's Westminster waiting for #TonyBenn funeral to begin. Greatest Labour politician of his generation,' she also wrote. But her messages, seen by her 63,000 followers, sparked anger, with one urging her: 'Put your phone down you prat!'.
