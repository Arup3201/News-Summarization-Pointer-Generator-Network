Sam Allardyce admits the heat is already on at West Ham after starting the new campaign with a home defeat.

It wasn’t simply the pain of losing to neighbours Spurs but also the experience that a flying start can set the tone for the months ahead, while an early setback is only likely to increase anxiety levels.

Asked when he expected to start feeling the pressure, he guffawed and replied: 'Tomorrow'.

Allardyce studies trends and statistics. 'The start is everything,' he admitted. 'It is a trigger to the whole season and whereabouts you are going to finish. 

'The perfect example is our first two seasons back in the Premier League where we acquired 14 points in the first eight games in the first [season] and only eight in the first eight last season.

'We saw that last season was a struggle. In the end we finished six points behind the season before.

'We had a huge amount of problems and lot of criticism for results and that comes by allowing yourself to slip into the bottom or relegation zone. That is where the pressure really mounts on you.

'Our life is about results, not how well you play or compete. The game is about winning and we have not won so people will be disappointed.

'They’ll not be any more disappointed than me or the players in the dressing room. They’re all downhearted, as we lost and the way that we lost. Deep down inside they know what a big three points we have let slip; a big-big three points, against our local and biggest rivals.'

Allardyce must ensure West Ham respond in another London derby, against Crystal Palace on Saturday. He has not given up hope of adding to the squad and hopes more players are closer to full fitness by then, including new signing Enner Valencia, who came off the bench against Spurs.

'When everyone is fit, our squad runs at the same level as most teams around our level,' he added, and he was heartened by much of what he saw in Saturday’s 1-0 defeat and felt his team would have won had Mark Noble not missed the penalty awarded as Tottenham went down to 10 men.

'I don’t think there is much doubt about that,'said Allardyce. 'But I would want the players to forgive Mark for missing a penalty for the first time and not put it on him as a heavy burden as he does not deserve it. His penalty taking in the three years that I have been here has been absolutely superb.

'We have to forgive him for missing the odd one and the rest of the lads should have made up for that. When they came in at the end they should’ve been smacking him on the back of the head saying don’t worry about it we’ve got you out of jail. That’s what we should have done.'
