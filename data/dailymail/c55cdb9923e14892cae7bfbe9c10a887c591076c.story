A billionaire Arab prince has been charged with being drunk on an aircraft after being thrown off a passenger jet by police officers armed with 50,000 volt Taser guns.

Bahraini national Mubarak Hamad, 29, will appear before magistrates in London later this month in connection with the incident at Heathrow airport in July.

Hamad - believed to be a close relative of Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa - lives in Eaton Square, Belgravia, one of central London’s most sought after addresses.

Allegations:
Mubarak Hamad had boarded a Boeing at Heathrow Airport (file 
picture) on Sunday July 22 when he allegedly began shouting and 
complaining about the poor service

Past and present residents include 
Charles Saatchi and his wife Nigella Lawson, James Bond actors Sean 
Connery and Roger Moore plus former Chelsea football manager Jose 
Mourinho.

He had 
boarded a Boeing 777 on the morning of Sunday July 22 when it is alleged
that he began shouting and complaining about the poor service on the 
BA125 flight to Doha in Qatar, via Bahrain.

It
is also alleged that members of the crew were forced to call the police
who arrived with stun guns after he stormed the flight deck and refused
to go back to his seat.

Wealthy Hamad was then dragged off 
the plane and taken to a police station near the airport where his DNA, 
mugshot and fingerprints were taken.

He
was bailed, but was told he was being formally charged when he answered
his bail yesterday. He is due to appear in court later this month.

A
Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: 'Mubarak Hamad, 29, of Belgravia, was 
charged on October 17th with being drunk on an aircraft and has been 
bailed to appear at Uxbridge Magistrates Court.'

Human
rights campaigners have in the past criticised King Hamad whose regime 
has been accused of violently repressing pro-democracy activists.
