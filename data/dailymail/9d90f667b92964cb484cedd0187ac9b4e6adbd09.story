A former chef accidentally killed his girlfriend by falling asleep on top of her, an inquest heard.

13st Robert Trigg and 8st Susan 
Nicholson had been snuggled together on the sofa when he 
rolled over and suffocated his partner of four months.

The heavy sleeper, 47, awoke next morning 
to find the ex-insurance worker, 52, dead and was initially questioned by 
police on suspicion of accidental manslaughter but was released without 
charge.

Tragedy: Robert Trigg accidentally suffocated his girlfriend Susan Nicholson after rolling over on her as they slept on the sofa at their Worthing home (file picture)

Robert attended the inquest and heard that it was possible Susan had been smothered in as little as 15 seconds.

Home Office pathologist Dr Simon Paul told the coroner: 'Susan died as a result of somebody sleeping on top of her.'

The inquest heard that Susan and Robert snuggled up together on the sofa of the flat they shared and fell asleep in each other's arms.

However, during the course of the night Mr Trigg rolled on top of Ms Nicholson's head, suffocating her.

He awoke the next morning with his torso lying diagonally across her face.

Her face had turned purple and she was unresponsive and in the same position she had been throughout the night.

The
post-mortem examination found pinpoint haemorrhages in one of her eyes,
her face, neck and upper chest - consistent with external pressure.

Mr Trigg had been lying next to Ms Nicholson, on his side, with his head on her chest, the inquest heard. However, at some point during the night he had moved positions and woke up with his head on the arm of the sofa and his torso smothering Ms Nicholson

Dr Paul told the inquest in Worthing, West Sussex that it was possible the pressure lasted as little as 15 seconds.

The couple had been living together for just four months in Ms Nicholson's flat in Worthing.

Mr Trigg told the inquest that they would often sleep together on the sofa instead of their bed and had done so dozens of times before.

On April 17 the pair had fallen asleep at about midnight with slender Ms Nicholson on her back with her head about halfway on the sofa and her leg over-hanging the arm.

Mr Trigg had been lying next to her, on his side, with his head on her chest.

However, at some point during the night he had moved positions and woke up with his head on the arm of the sofa and his torso smothering Ms Nicholson.

Detectives had investigated the death and considered bringing charges of manslaughter or accidental manslaughter against Mr Trigg but did not find any case to answer.

Mr Trigg told West Sussex Coroner Michael Kendall: 'I went to bed at about midnight. She was on the sofa and I asked her if she was coming (to bed).

'But she said "Let's snuggle in, let's crash here together". So I slept on the sofa with her.

'It was relatively narrow but we had slept in it 40 times before. We didn't have a bed for five weeks when we first moved in and it became common practice.

'I would often sleep on my side or find myself on the floor.'

Mr Trigg said that he woke up at 2am to go to the toilet and returned to the sofa. He told the inquest Susan had been in the exact same position she had fallen asleep in.

He awoke again at 8.15am the next morning, on top of her.

He said: 'At this point I realised I couldn't hear breathing. I had my midriff over her chest area.

'When I looked down she was in the same position but she had changed colour. I just thought the worst, I had suffocated her.

'Her hand was still warm and I held it and said "Time to wake up, stop mucking about" but there was no response.'

Dr Paul told the inquest that as well as the pin-point haemorrhages, the inside of Susan's lips had indentations consistent with being compressed against the teeth.

'She died as a result of somebody sleeping on top of her.'

In recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Kendall said: 'There is no doubt that Susan's death was caused by Mr Trigg overlaying on her face.

'There is no evidence whatsoever that that was part of an altercation, violence or an incident of aggression of any kind.

'We cannot be sure precisely how Mr Trigg came to lie across Susan's face but the evidence is that he did and that immediately caused the death.'
