A WWII veteran died a hero  after pushing his wife of 68 years out of the way from an oncoming car.

Clark and Betty Biddle, both 88, were high school sweethearts in Ohio. She had waited for him while he served in the army. They had two children, a dog and a vegetable garden.

But their  love story took a tragic turn last Thursday as the couple walked across a shopping center to meet high school friends for their monthly lunch reunion.

WWII veteran Clark Biddle died a hero after pushing Betty, his wife of 68 years, out of the way from an oncoming car. They were high school sweethearts in Columbus, Ohio 

Betty had broken her hip two years ago, and was relying on her husband and a walker to help her move that day. 

When Clark saw that she was in danger as a car began backing out of a parking space, he didn't hesitate. 

Betty was bruised, but Clark had been struck. He fell and hit his head, suffering massive brain trauma.

He passed away two days later.  

'I don't know if I'm going to make it without him,' Betty told the Columbus Dispatch. 

Betty said she misses Clark 'every minute', and kisses the picture that she carries around of the two of them, sitting at the kitchen table together, 'a number of times a day'.  

She said she will never get over the sight of seeing her husband on the ground.

Betty said she will never get over the sight of seeing her husband on the ground and that sometimes she wishes she was with him

'Sometimes I wish I was with him, I really do,' she said. 

Gary Biddle, the couple's son, said his father was acting on instinct when he saved Betty. He had been her primary caregiver ever since her injury two years ago. 

'This is dad, he would sacrifice himself for others and always cared for them, more than thinking about himself,' he told the Columbus Dispatch. 

Clark was a pilot. He also opened and owned a drive-in restaurant bearing his name for 25 years, and played the saxophone and clarinet for dance bands.

He was a well-known member of his community, unable to go to the grocery store without running into people he knew, according to his son-in-law Dan Cress. 

Clark was also a friendly neighbor. Laura Jones told the Columbus Dispatch that he would let her dog out every day while she was at work after her husband died six years ago.

And, without fail, there was always a note and two cookies  waiting for her when she got home.

Columbus police said the driver of the car is currently under investigation.
