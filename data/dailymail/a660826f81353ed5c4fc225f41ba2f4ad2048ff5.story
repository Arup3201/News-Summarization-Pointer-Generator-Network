Operation: Jasmine Smith is one patient to have benefited from the pioneering surgical technology

Pioneering surgical technology similar to car satnav systems is revolutionising the treatment of difficult-to-reach brain tumours. The technique uses MRI scanning to show the soft tissues inside the brain, in real time. So unlike an  X-ray, which is effectively a photograph, this is like a live video feed from inside the head.

The images are used to create a three-dimensional map of the brain, which is shown on a screen, allowing surgeons to pre-plan the operation instead of going in blind.

Brain tumours are among the hardest to remove completely. Some surgeons describe the process as like ‘trying to extract a spider from jelly’. While parts of the head are easily cut away, the nature of such cancers means it spreads through the brain – so ‘legs’ may be left, which will continue to grow.

Taking away too much healthy brain tissue can result in long- term damage and complications such as loss of speech, vision and motor functions.

During the new ‘satnav’ operation, images can be updated during surgery, making it far easier to target the tumour precisely and helping to avoid harm to the surrounding brain.

Mr Andrew McEvoy, neurosurgeon at the National Hospital  for Neurology & Neurosurgery in London, has performed more than 100 of these operations since the technology became available two years ago.

He says: ‘We can stop the operation and scan the brain while the head  is still open to double-check that all the tumour has gone.

‘Patients have their wound closed up only once the scan gives the  all-clear. It lessens the need for a second operation a few days later to remove any tumour left behind. Afterwards, it leaves more vital functions intact because the surgery is so controllable.’

One patient to have benefited is Jasmine Smith, 22, a trainee nurse. Jasmine lives with her parents, Ruth, 41, and Ambrose, 42, who run a roofing business, and her sister Amber, 19, in Denham, Buckinghamshire.

Jasmine’s problems began in 2008, when she suffered the first of a series of seizures. ‘I was talking to my mum when I had a strong sense of déjà vu,’ she says.

‘Apparently, then I babbled something about my brother – but I don’t have a brother. Then I felt really tired and slept for two hours.’

A week later Jasmine fainted. Initially she put the incidents down to exhaustion. She was studying performing arts and dancing seven days a week.

But when she started to feel a numbness in her face, she went to her GP, fearing she had had a stroke. He immediately referred her for  a brain scan, which revealed a tangerine-sized tumour.

Every day at least 20 people are diagnosed with a brain tumour,  and Jasmine’s type, an epidermoid tumour (also called an epidermoid cyst), makes up about one per cent of those. It is benign (non-cancerous) and is formed by skin cells deposited in the wrong place during brain development in the womb. This causes a cyst to form, which makes up the tumour.

It is likely Jasmine was born with it, and due to its slow growth she developed symptoms only when it got big enough to put pressure on her brain and trigger seizures. Her neurologist told her that because of its position, the tumour was inoperable. Her only option was to try  anti-epileptic drugs to see if they would control the seizures, which continued to worsen – and often led to her blacking out completely.

Then, two years ago her neurologist referred her to Mr McEvoy as she was considered an ideal candidate for the new ‘satnav’ procedure.

Jasmine underwent the 13-hour operation under general anaesthetic in June 2011. After nine days, she was sent home. Eighteen months later she suffered another major seizure – and has been put back  on anti-epileptic medication, which has now controlled the problem. She has since returned to work.

Despite not having a perfect result, she is happy. She says: ‘The reality of my ordeal sank in only about a year after the op – I was looking at photos of my brain after surgery and burst into tears. It felt like a release. I decided to give up dancing for nursing. I started my training in September. I felt so inspired by the wonderful medical team that saved my life, I want to give something back.’
