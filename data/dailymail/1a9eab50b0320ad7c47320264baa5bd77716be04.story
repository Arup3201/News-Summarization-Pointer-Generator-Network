A notorious fugitive who's been evading authorities since 1998, when he faked his own death just before his trial on child sex-abuse charges, has been captured in Montana.

Daniel Clement Chafe, 55, was taken into custody Wednesday in Bozeman where he had been living under a different name, Lieutenant Gregg Hastings said.

Chafe had been living in a city near Bozeman where he owned a computer business and used the alias Gwydyn Stryder Styarfyr.

The FBI said the married Chafe was recruiting girls between of the ages of 14 and 16 to form what he dubbed the 'Cobalt Clan' when he was arrested 15 years ago.

'His reported goal was to have sex with these young girls in order to produce a large number of children over which he could rule,' according to the FBI's most wanted poster.

Wanted: Chafe was missing for 15 years before he was finally captured Wednesday

Police arrested him on charges of rape, sodomy and sex abuse of two teenage girls, and said they had identified other victims.

Chafe moved to New Mexico during the investigation and worked as a computer technician. On September 13, 1998 - 10 days before his scheduled trial in Roseburg - a friend with whom he had gone fishing in Washington state told authorities that Chafe fell overboard and was missing.

A search failed to find him, and investigators considered him a fugitive. He became the subject of several television shows, including 'America's Most Wanted,' and was in consideration for the FBI's Top 10 list, Hastings said.

The friend who told authorities that Chafe went overboard has not been charged with a crime at this point, Hastings said.

'Obviously we've got to learn what's gone on over the last 15 years,' he said.

Authorities in Roseburg declined to discuss the late 1990s investigation on Friday.

Undersheriff Dan Springer of Gallatin County, Montana, said detectives have found no evidence that Chafe was trying to recruit Montana girls.

Held: Chafe is in prison Bozeman, Montana but will be returning to Oegon his trial

'We have no indication [of that] and we do not have any kind of investigation into charges of that nature,' he said.

Chafe remains in a Montana jail pending extradition to Roseburg, where he faces six counts of third-degree rape, five counts of third-degree sexual abuse and seven counts of third-degree sodomy.

Hastings said an Oregon State Police detective recently uncovered evidence that Chafe was living under an assumed name in Montana. Chafe was arrested during a traffic stop by FBI agents, the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office and the Montana Highway Patrol.
