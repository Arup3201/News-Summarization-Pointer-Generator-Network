The smallest-ever baby to be born and survive at a Milwaukee hospital has returned triumphant to celebrate her first birthday.

Born at just 24 weeks and so tiny she weighed only 13 ounces, baby Phoenix is now a bouncing one-year-old girl who weighs almost 18lb.

Her mother Shaina Freeman was struck with early onset pre-eclampsia, a condition that threatened both Freeman and her unborn daughter and for which the only cure is to deliver the child.

Freeman's obstetrician Dr Matthew Lee at St Joseph's Hospital has delivered thousands of babies, but he is aware that Phoenix is no ordinary baby.

'(It's) really about a miracle. What they could do doesn't always turn out this way, but we are all fortunate that she has done well,' Lee told WISN.

Phoenix was in the ICU for a total of three months until she weighed five pounds.

When she was first born, her father Charles Sims says, she fit into the palm of his hand.

'She's having so much fun. Look how strong she is,' says Sims of his daughter today.

Phoenix's survival wasn't just luck, though. A whole team of people worked to get her through her first months in hospital, and they all gathered to celebrate the growing girl.

Phoenix still must receive oxygen from a tank for a lung condition, but she is expected to grow out of it.

Her mother is ecstatic at her little girl's progress.

'It's a blessing, she is doing really good. We're blessed that everyone was able to make it today. She's doing good,' Freeman told WISN.
