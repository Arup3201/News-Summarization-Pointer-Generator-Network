Think those embarrassing images you sent over Snapchat are safe? Think again.

An app that lets you save and re-open Snapchat messages, without the sender ever knowing, has now been launched.

Snapchat is a picture-sharing app that lets you send photos, text, messages and drawings to your friends.

Snapchat is a picture-sharing app that lets you send photos, text, messages and drawings to your friends.

You can choose how long you want the picture to be viewable, up to ten seconds, before the app 'deletes' it.

To use it, open the app and create your message.

Special effects and even text can also be added.

Choose a recipient from a list of friends.

Specify how long you want the picture or video to last, up to 10 seconds, then send.

In theory a user can choose how long they want the picture to be viewable - up to ten seconds - before the app deletes it.

But now SnapHack, a $0.99 (62p) app, lets you look at old images sent through the Snapchat app at anytime.

The creator, Darren Jones, has developed a number of other apps under DAP Logic.

According to Business Insider, Jones is now working on an improved version of SnapHack which will allow Snapchat users to forward saved messages to other friends.

Snapchat photos are only meant to last up to 10 seconds before they are erased from a recipient's phone

The app follows an announcement by a forensics firm in Utah that discovered a way to find the so-called deleted pics, and created a way to download them from the 'hidden' location.

In May, Orem-based firm Decipher Forensics discovered that Snapchat was saving the images.

And the group said the app's code suggests that it isn't a bug; the developers appeared to have coded the app to do this, despite claiming that all images are automatically destroyed.

Richard Hickman, a digital forensics examiner from Decipher Forensics said: 'The actual app is saving the picture.'

'[Snapchat] claim that it's deleted, and it's not even deleted.

It's actually saved on the phone.'
