Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp - the king of transfer deadline day - is set for another frantic few hours of potential late deals.

Loan moves for Tottenham duo Emmanuel Adebayor and Aaron Lennon will be explored by Rangers today, as will a swoop for Wolves forward Bakary Sako..

Redknapp is desperate to bolster his forward line before Monday's deadline and is ready to look at his former club for reinforcements.

Hull City target Aaron Lennon is also said to be on Redknapp's transfer wish-list 

Jonathan Walters became the first PL player to complete a perfect hat-trick since Kevin Nolan and Romelu Lukaku in May 2013.

Adebayor was brought to White Hart Lane by Redknapp, who is keen to strike an agreement with his ex-employers over a temporary switch until the end of the season. 

The major stumbling block towards a deal will be the striker's wages, which are said to be around £100,000-per-week.

Rangers will need Spurs to supplement a large portion of Adebayor's salary, a stipulation White Hart Lane chairman Daniel Levy, who is a notorious tough negotiator, will be reluctant to agree to.

Adebayor's future is set to be one of the prevalent issues of transfer deadline. 

Stoke City manager Mark Hughes is also understood to be keen on taking the striker from Spurs, who will listen to offers for the former Manchester City and Arsenal man.

Paris St Germain have also shown an interest in Adebayor.

Rangers are also preparing to pounce for Lennon, should his proposed switch to Hull collapse. The winger looked set for a loan move to the Tigers, with a view to a permanent switch in the summer.

Wolves forward Bakary Sako is attracting interest from Premier League duo QPR and West Brom 

But there has been a dispute between the two clubs over who will pay the majority of his £55,000-per-week wages until the end of the season.

Spurs have been alerted to the situation regarding Lennon, who is a long term target for Redknapp, and QPR could pounce if the issue isn't resolved.

Meanwhile, Sako remains a target for the Hoops after Redknapp admitted his interest in the forward last week.

The Hoops’ need for reinforcements was clear at Stoke on Saturday. Their record 11th consecutive away defeat proved too much for midfielder Joey Barton, who said: ‘Umpteen times this season we’ve been our own worst enemy and it’s not f*****g good enough.’

Stoke’s Jonathan Walters helped himself to a ‘perfect hat-trick’ — one scored with his left foot, one with his right and the final one with his head.
