A Michigan family made a frantic 911 call begging for help after their minivan became lodged beneath a moving semi-truck in a snowstorm.

Matthew Menz, 46, was driving with his wife and two grown children south of Roscommon, Michigan, early Wednesday morning when their vehicle rear-ended a truck and became stuck.

Just before 2am, Pamela Menz called 911 telling the dispatcher that their snow-encased minivan was being dragged by the truck-trailer along northbound I-75.

Scary: Deputies helped the family of four early Wednesday morning, after their minivan was unwittingly hauled by the semi-truck for 16 miles in the snow 

'It was snow blinding. We ran into the back of a semi-truck and he's not stopping and our car is embedded underneath of it,' the caller said. 'Our windshields have completely shattered. I can't see nothing.'

'I just want to get off the back of this thing,' Mrs Menz pleaded on the call, which lasted for more than 20 minutes.

Law enforcement officials estimate that the Menzs' 2001 Toyota Sienna was dragged down the road for 16 miles before before they were rescued.   

Menz was  returning from an airport with her husband Matt Menz behind the wheel, as the couple's children Justin and Jennifer, were passengers, UpNorthLive reported.

The Roscommon County Sheriff's Office said snowfall prevented the family from telling 911 where they were exactly, and that deputies for both Roscommon and Crawling counties went to help. 

Matt Menz told UpNorthLive of the semi-truck driver 'He apparently didn't know that we were there and before we knew it, he ended up dragging us 16 miles. 

'I was on the phone with 911 for the whole time. It's a hopeless feeling, helpless feeling. Out of control, you're just along for the ride.'

Justin Menz has autism and was launched from the backseat into his sister's seat in the minivan, the website reported.

Jennifer Menz told UpNorthLive '[I] started to console him, and take care of him, and tell him it was okay. I started to call him down. When the airbags went off, just that smell like we were going to catch on fire and I thought we were.'

The 911 dispatcher initially asked if they could honk to alert the driver of the semi, but Mrs Menz replied that their minivan lost all power and had no heat, Mlive.com reported. 

'We have nothing; we’ve lost everything,' Pamela Menz said.

Terror: The Roscommon County Sheriff's Office said that snowfall prevented the Menz from telling 911 where they were

Incident: The Menz family was on the phone with 911 for 25 minutes until deputies showed up and were able to help them 

At one point, the family thought the truck was slowing down to get off the highway, and the dispatcher asked if they could jump out of the minivan at the exit ramp, but the family had no idea where they were.

The dispatcher was able to pinpoint their location using GPS and determined that the two vehicles had just crossed into Crawford County. About 35 minutes into the ordeal, sheriff's deputies showed up and were able to help the stranded family.  

In a release, the sheriff's office said 'The vehicles were later intercepted by deputies from the Crawford County Sheriff’s Office, south of Grayling on northbound I-75. 

'Deputies successfully stopped the vehicles without incident, 16 miles from where the original collision had occurred.'

Authorities took the four people to a nearby hospital, and 'no serious injuries are suspected,' the release said.

The unsuspecting semi-truck driver was reportedly upset after learning of what happened and told police he did not want to drive his truck again, according to MyFox Detroit,
