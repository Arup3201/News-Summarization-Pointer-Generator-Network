A golfer's idea of a hole-in-one quickly got out of hand when one player stabbed another with a broken golf club.

Police say the pair were on the 12th hole at Westwynd Golf Course in Oakland County near Detroit, Michigan when the duo got into an argument about the score.

59-year-old Glen Lott broke his Callaway 5-iron on the arm of his 65-year-old partner.

Lott was arraigned on Friday in Rochester Hills District Court and ordered as part of his $100,000 bond to stay away from the golf course.

Other members of the group held Lott down as the victim fled to the clubhouse in a golf cart for safety.

A chase followed with the Lott managing to escape and follow the golfer in another golf cart screaming he was 'going to get him.'

Lott, a former Drake University football star, drove off in his car but was later taken into custody. He has now been arraigned on $100,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court next Tuesday.

He could face up to four years in prison if convicted.

Par-for-the-course: Oakland County Sheriff's deputies say the incident occurred this week on the 12th hole at the Westwynd Golf Course

Jimmy Mehlberg, Westwynd golf course manager, explained that a member of the private Wyndgate Country Club who lives on the public course called the clubhouse to report yelling and shoving.

'It was group of 20 friends — or maybe former friends now — or maybe they used to be coworkers who have a travel league,' Mehlberg said, adding that the all-men’s group had played the course twice last year and once so far this year.

He called violence on the green 'pretty rare,' adding, 'It was a crazy day. I’ve worked at a golf course for 12 years and nothing like this ever happened.'The victim was treated and received multiple stitches in his arm after being stabbed with the jagged edge of the broken club.

Deputies recovered the broken half of the 5-iron and found the other half still in the Lott's golf bag.
