A man charged with impersonating a University of Washington employee and attempting to kidnap a student continues to display increasingly disturbing behavior.

Jonathan Gears was wheeled into a Seattle court Thursday tied to a chair and was forced to wear a spit guard.

According to KIRO 7 TV, he laughed through proceedings, addressed the judge in a British accent, and later thanked President Obama for his work.

On January 16, Gears allegedly tried to kidnap sophomore Maddy Greenfield on the University of Washington campus around noon.

Greenfield said Gears approached her and introduced himself - in a British accent - as a member of staff.

He shook her hand but then refused to let go, Greenfield said.

'I said, ''Please let go''. And he grabbed my arm, and said ''you're coming with me'' and tried to pull me away,' Greenfield told KIRO.

Greenfield kicked and screamed to get away, and when Gears grabbed her backpack, she quickly took it off and ran.

Other students witnessed what was happening and chased Gears down, helping police to arrest him.

During his arrest, he reportedly said he was HIV positive and attempted to bite officers several times.

Gears has no connection to the University of Washington.

His attorney says he suffers from mental issues. 

Gears has been charged with assault with attempt to kidnap.

Prosecutors say he is dangerous and should not be let out on bail.

The judge set his bail at $250,000.

KIRO7 found he does have a criminal history that includes an arrest for assaulting a police officer.

There is no more further information on Gears' background.
