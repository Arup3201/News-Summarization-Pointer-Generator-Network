The nine-year-old daughter of a black, unarmed man  shot dead by a white Phoenix police officer who mistook a pill bottle for a gun is speaking out in an emotional interview.

Rumain Brisbon, 34, was killed after an officer feared the suspect was armed during a struggle.

Now his daughter Aiyana has made an emotional a plea to law enforcement across the country as she talks about how unnecessary the killing was, and how her father will never see her grow up.

'I felt like that it really didn't need to happen,' Aiyana Raines told Fox10.

Emotional plea: Aiyana Raines, nine, (above) gave an emotional interview after an officer shot her father and said: 'The officer did not have the right to shoot my dad or kill him'

Tragedy: Rumain Brisbon (above with his youngest daughter) was killed after an officer feared he was armed during a struggle, but it was just a pill bottle. The officer shot him twice in the torse

'He is going to miss our birthdays and how my little sisters grow up, and how we grow up because she is the only one and I am only nine, and my sister is only 10, and my dad is not going to be here for our happy moments and our sad moments.'

As for the moment she found out that her father had been killed, little Aiyana said, 'I started crying cause I really didn't believe that my dad got killed.'

The Phoenix Police Department claim Brisbon was sitting in a Cadillac SUV on Tuesday evening and that witnesses told an officer he was selling drugs.

Police approached him and made several demands for him to show his hands, but Brisbon fled. During a scuffle, the officer - a 30-year-old male officer with seven years experience on the force - felt a pill bottle in his waistband, which he believed was a gun.

'The officer gave the suspect several commands to get on the ground but he refused to comply, yelling profanities at the officer,' the Department said in a statement. 'Fearing Brisbon had a gun in his pocket the officer fired two rounds striking Brisbon in the torso.'

He was pronounced dead at the scene. 

Questions: Police said Brisbon (above with his youngest daughter) was carrying a vial of oxycodone pills at the time of the incident. They had earlier received reports that he was selling drugs

Missed: The sisters, who are aged nine and 10, have said they won't have a father to watch them grow up

Rap sheet: Court documents show that Brisbon was known to authorities and had a criminal record including burglary, DUI, narcotics, and paraphernalia related charges

Police said Brisbon was carrying a vial of oxycodone pills, and that a semi-automatic handgun and a jar of marijuana were found in the SUV. 

A nearby resident told The Arizona Republic that he went over to the window after hearing the shooting and saw the officer 'walking out, and he was cussing, you know, he was screaming, "F***, f***", like upset that he shot the guy'. 

Sergeant Trent Crump, a Phoenix police spokesman, said at the Wednesday news conference that 'this one went bad from the standpoint of how it ended' but that they stood by the officer's actions.

'Let's be very clear,' he said. 'The officer was doing what we expect him to do, which is investigate crimes that neighbors are telling him are occurring in that part of the complex.'

Friends, including the man who had been in the SUV with Brisbon, said that the victim was simply on his way to deliver fast food to his children in the apartment block.

One witness said he did not see police officers trying to speak with Brisbon before the altercation. 

'The Phoenix Police Department does not treat white people this way,' The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, who organized a march in the city on Thursday night, told KPNX. 'What that officer did was harass and accost them.' 

Gathering: Crowds formed on Thursday night in Phoenix to march to the police department

Planning: There are also rallies planned for the city on Friday evening as well

Aiyana also has a message for the officer 

'To the officer that killed my dad, let me tell you something,' she said. 'You hurt three little girls that looked up to their dad. 'I am hurting, but I have to stay strong for my dad and my little sister.'

More importantly, she wants people to know that above all else, her dad was a 'good dad' and that 'the officer did not have the right to shoot my dad or kill him'.

Marci A. Kratter, an attorney for Brisbon's family, told The Arizona Republic that witnesses disputed the official police account and that 'we intend to pursue this to the full extent of the law'.   

Court documents show that Brisbon had a criminal record including burglary, DUI, narcotics, and paraphernalia related charges. 

About 100 people marched to the Phoenix Police Department on Thursday evening to protest the fatal shooting, which was likened to the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York.

Outrage: As the protests were underway in Phoenix, hundreds of demonstrators marched through Manhattan and across the Brooklyn Bridge (pictured) following the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown

Both were unarmed black men who died after altercations with white police officers. Grand juries in both cities have decided not to indict the officers - sparking massive protests across the U.S.

In Cleveland, there have also been protests after a black 12-year-old boy, Tamir Rice, who was shot dead by a white rookie police officer after he mistook the boy's fake gun for a real weapon. A grand jury is deciding whether or not to pursue charges in that case.

In the protests in Phoenix on Thursday, demonstrators demanded to know the identity of the police officer who killed Brisbon. Another protest is scheduled for Friday night.
