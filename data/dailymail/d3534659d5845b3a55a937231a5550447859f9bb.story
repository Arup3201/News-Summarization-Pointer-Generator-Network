Renewed attempts to help the jailed Pakistani doctor who led the U.S. to Osama bin Laden must be made, a Californian congressman has said.

Rep Dana Rohrabacher has made Dr Shakil Afridi's case a personal cause, but fears the issue has fallen off the political radar.

He said without U.S. intervention the man credited with helping track down Bin Laden would be left to 'suffer in a dungeon'.

Rohrabacher said: 'If we let that person just 
hang on a limb and forget him, now that he's put himself in danger for 
us -- well shame on us.

'I 
am very concerned that the United States will shame itself by letting Dr
Afridi sit there and suffer in a dungeon, and be tortured.

'It doesn't appear that other people are taking this case seriously. I don't see any movement.'

Dr Afridi helped the CIA by running a fake vaccination programme that allowed him to collect the DNA of Bin Laden’s children from the family compound in Abbottabad.

Sample analysis confirmed the terror leader was probably there and triggered the deadly mission by US Navy SEALS last May.

The successful mission sparked a rift between the US and Pakistani leaders who were embarrassed that Bin Laden had been living in a major military hub close to the capital.

Justice: Osama bin Laden, (pictured in 1998) mastermind of the 9/11 attacks and the world's most wanted man, was killed in a US operation in north-western Pakistan which was successfully launched with help from information gathered by Dr Shakil Afridi

Strike: The compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan where Osama bin Laden, the leader of terrorist network Al-Qaeda was killed by US military forces, in May last year

Angry Pakistani officials felt the 
covert operation was a violation of its sovereignty and implied the US 
was unable to trust its key partner in the war on terror.

Shortly after the raid which killed Bin Laden, Dr Afridi was arrested for conspiring against the state of Pakistan and last month jailed for 33 years.

Rohrabacher told FoxNews.com that he was 'frantically' trying to keep a focus on the doctors fate, claiming officials were neglecting the case which reflects badly on the U.S.

Concern: Secretary of state Hillary Clinton said she regretted Dr Afridi's conviction and the severity of his sentence

Afridi's brother Jamil told Fox News 
last month that Shakil Afridi had suffered torture while in custody 
ahead of his sentencing and previously appealed for U.S. Embassy help to
fight his legal case.

The U.S. has insisted there is no basis to imprison Afridi on treason charges and secretary of state Hillary Clinton said in May that she regretted 'both the fact that he was convicted and the severity of his sentence'.

Following Rohrabacher's latest comments that State Department said it was still focused on the case.

Spokesman Mark Toner told FoxNews.com: 'We continue to urge Pakistan to consider his appeal in a manner that is expeditious, transparent and consistent with due process.

'We consider his treatment and his sentencing to be among the range of important issues we are in the midst of discussing with the Pakistani (government).'

In May, outraged at Drv Afridi's conviction, U.S. Senate panels voted overwhelmingly to cut aid to Islamabad by $33million - one million for every year of the physician's 33-year sentence for high treason.
