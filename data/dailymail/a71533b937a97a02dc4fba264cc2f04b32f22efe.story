Accused: Minnesota Pastor Jacoby Kindred was charged with two counts of criminal sexual conduct for allegedly abusing two girls he was a grandfather-figure to for more than a decade

A 61-year-old Minnesota pastor has been accused of raping two girls for nearly a decade, starting when they were just 6 and 7 years old.

Jacoby Kindred, pastor of One Accord Ministries, was reported by the girls' mother in July when she found a note one of her daughters wrote describing the abuse.

He has been charged with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.

Kindred became a grandfather-figure to the girls, now 16 and 17, when their mother started dating his son and they would have sleepovers at his house.Â 

That's when the molestation started, 
they say. Kindred told the victims that the 'devil was inside them' and 
that the sexual activity was the only cure.

One of the girls said Kindred would driver her to her boyfriend's house, where she was not allowed to go by herself, and threaten to tell her mom about the visits if she refused sex with him.

According to the complaint, the abuse included fondling, oral sex and rape and happened at Kindred's former residence in St Paul, a Target parking lot and his current home in Maplewood.

When
confronted with the accusations in August, Kindred admitted that the 
girls would come over for sleepovers but says he never touched them 
inappropriately.

Kindred denied the allegations, saying the girls' mother made up the story because her new boyfriend doesn't like him.

He ended the interview saying: 'And 
I'm gone...Get your warrants, do what you gotta do, no DNA, none of 
that...You weren't there, nobody was there!'

When TwinCities.com reached out to the pastor today, he went even further to denounce the teens' report.

'These are not really kids,' he said. 'They have a mind of the adult.'

I never did anything like that,' Kindred added. 'Anyone can make up anything when you sit there long enough and you rehearse it.'

He also called Minnesota a 'women's state' saying: 'All a woman has to do is make an accusation, true or false, and the man's going to be in trouble.'
