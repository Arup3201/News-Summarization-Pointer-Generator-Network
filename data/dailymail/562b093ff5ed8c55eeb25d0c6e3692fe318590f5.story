Magician Paul Daniels had to be treated by medics and given a tetanus jab after his finger was bitten by one of his stage rabbits.

The veteran performer, 76, was also prescribed antibiotics after he was nipped on the finger by one of the rabbits used in his act.

He had been preparing to go on stage in Crewe, Cheshire, when he reportedly attempted to stop his furry co-star from getting amorous with another of the rabbits, only to be bitten.

Daniels tweeted that he was late setting off for the show, part of his Back Despite Popular Demand Tour, because he was being treated for the bite.

'On the way to Lyceum Theatre Crewe. Slight delay due to Tetanus jab and antibiotics for rabbit bite :(,' he wrote.

The former Strictly Come Dancing star, who lives in Wargrave, Berkshire, with wife and assistant Debbie McGee, 55, later added: 'I am ready very early. It will be interesting to do magic with this elastoplasted finger. :).'

A source told The Sun: ‘It wasn’t too serious. He still has all his finger. It’s just a little sore. Debbie is enjoying playing nurse and has dressed up for him.’

The bite was not the first time Daniels has been injured in the name of magic.

In 2012 surgeons had to reattach one of his fingers after it was sliced off in an accident with a circular saw while Daniels was building props in his garden shed.

And the year before he was dealt a black eye and visited hospital to be checked over after he was hit in the face with a slice of pizza thrown by the puppet Sooty.
