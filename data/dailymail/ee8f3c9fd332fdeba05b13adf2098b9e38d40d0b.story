A growing number of doctors are continuing to practise  despite being convicted of serious crimes such as child porn and sexual assault, it can be revealed today.

Figures show that more than 1,000 medics have been allowed to keep their jobs after being found guilty of offences - a 10 per cent rise in two years.

Other crimes include cruelty to children, domestic violence, drug-trafficking, possessing dangerous weapons and prostitution offences.

It is believed many offenders could be treating children.

Campaigners have reacted angrily to the figures, accusing medical chiefs of not doing enough to protect patients. 

But bosses at the General Medical Council, which released the data, say it is not always possible to automatically ban convicted doctors because it may breach their human rights.

Not struck off: Dr Ashley Sibery (left) has been suspended after being convicted of injecting his wife with heroin, but could in theory return to work when the ban expires. Meanwhile, Dr Hassan Abdulla (right) has been allowed to carry on working as a psychiatrist despite being convicted of illegally circumcising 41 boys in a 'non-sterile' unit. He has been barred from carrying out circumcisions for two years

Roger Goss, co-director of Patient Concern, told MailOnline: 'It makes a nonsense of the GMC's claims that it safeguards patients. They safeguard doctors' careers.

'Human rights are supposed to protect patients not doctors. We are in a life-and-death business here.

'There needs to be legislation that makes it illegal for doctors to practise if they are convicted of serious crimes such as sexual offences.'

Mr Goss said patients should be told when their doctor has been convicted of an offence or even when an accusation has been made against them.

He added: 'We would like to see every complaint against doctors accessible on the internet, with the caveat stating that it is merely an accusation.'

The figures, released to MailOnline after a request under the Freedom of Information Act, show there were 1,025 registered doctors with a total of 1172 criminal convictions as of August 28 this year.

They reveal that 35 had been convicted of sexual assault, 29 for actual bodily harm and three for grievous bodily harm.

Two were found guilty of possessing indecent images of children, one of taking or making indecent images of children and two of cruelty and neglect of children.

Seven medics were convicted of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution, while ten were successfully prosecuted for domestic violence.

Meanwhile, more than 340 were convicted of drink-driving and 192 of dangerous driving.

Figures released by the GMC in December 2012 showed there was a total of 927 doctors with convictions, meaning there are around 100 more registered this year.

Any doctor who receives a custodial sentence is automatically referred to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) which is responsible for holding disciplinary hearings for doctors pursued by the GMC.

Dr Nicholas Spicer escaped being struck off in 2010 even though he was described by the GMC as a 'deviant' for downloading child-sex stories.

He read the paedophile fantasies on his home computer between 2003 and 2007 while working with children as a GP, but was cleared of misconduct and allowed to go back to work in another part of the country following a six-month ban. 

In another case, Dr Hassan Abdulla has been allowed to carry on working as a psychiatrist despite being convicted of illegally circumcising 41 boys in a 'non-sterile' unit  in Leicester between October 2011 and January 2012.

An MPTS panel banned him in September from carrying out circumcisions for two years, but said to suspend him from working as a mental health doctor would 'deprive the public of a competent psychiatrist'.

Meanwhile, Dr Ashley Sibery also escaped a permanent ban despite watching his wife collapse after injecting her with heroin.

The 38-year-old was convicted in September 2012 of giving his partner Sital the class A drug at their home in Edinburgh after tucking their three-year-old son into bed.

He had earlier admitted to her that he had been using the drug for two months.

Sibery was ordered to perform 300 hours community service and placed on supervision by the authorities for two years after he was convicted of culpable and reckless conduct at an Edinburgh Sheriff Court hearing in December 2012.

At an original MPTS hearing in January this year, Michael Uberoi, defending, said that striking him off the medical register would be 'disproportionate to the facts of the case'.

The tribunal ruled his fitness to practise was impaired by his convictions, but decided to impose just a nine-month ban.

On the rise: More than 1,000 medics have been allowed to keep their jobs after being found guilty of crimes ranging from sex assault to child porn - a 10% increase in two years (file picture posed by models)

Sibery could have gone back to work when the suspension expired at the end of November, but a panel reviewing his case in October imposed a further 10-month suspension, it was reported by the Edinburgh News.  

The GMC has said it previously tried to impose an automatic ban for doctors, particularly those on the sex offenders' register, but after consulting with a top lawyer was advised it would be incompatible with human rights legislation. 

Niall Dickson, Chief Executive of the General Medical Council, told MailOnline: 'For serious convictions, we will now always call for the doctor to be struck off the register.

'We are also seeking powers to remove doctors from the register without the need for a hearing, if they have committed very serious offences, which we believe these are incompatible with practising as a doctor. 

'We currently do not have a right of appeal against panel decisions when we believe they are too lenient.

'The government is currently progressing legislation to provide a right to appeal such decisions to the High Court and we hope that legislation will be passed before the General Election.'

A spokeswoman for the GMC said details of sanctions against doctors are published on its website.
