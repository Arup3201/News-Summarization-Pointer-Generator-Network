Hero: David Cameron told of how he rescued a sheep stuck in mud near his Chipping Norton home

He normally does his mud-slinging in the House of Commons.

But David Cameron has told how he got waist-deep in a different kind of muck when he dived into a swamp to save a sheep.

The Prime Minister rescued the ewe near his home outside Chipping Norton.

Now nicknamed ‘Swampy’, she had become stuck trying to save her two lambs, both of which sadly drowned.

Mr Cameron, whose two armed police guards also pitched in, said: ‘I helped my neighbour with his lambing one weekend and that gave me more pleasure than anything I’ve done for a long time.

‘He lost one of his ewes and so we were bottle-feeding some of his lambs and then one of his sheep got stuck in a swamp.

‘Sadly two lambs had died and obviously she’d gone in to rescue them and they’d drowned.

'We managed to get the ewe out. Some of the staff with me joined in.

'We all jumped in and were up to our waists in the swamp.

‘So this ewe is now alive and well. I’m not saying I’m going to be a farmer, but I do love the countryside.’

Mr Cameron heard Swampy’s desperate bleating at 6pm on a Friday evening as he left neighbour Julian Tustian’s farm.

Mr Tustian said: ‘When I got there, David was in the swamp, waist-deep in mud, along with the two police, who had all gone in there to help drag this sheep out.

‘He was brilliant, pulling, pushing and shoving. He was covered in mud, he looked a mess. It’s nice to see, really - the police didn’t have to do that and neither did David Cameron.’

The ewe has now fully recovered from her ordeal last month. Mr Tustian said: ‘She’s very happy. She’s got no kids now so she’s having a summer off.’

Mr Tustian, 43, said the prime 
minister often liked to visit his farm during lambing, having grown up 
with sheep himself, as way to have some quiet time away from it all.

‘If I’m lambing, he will often pop in’, he said. ‘He likes to get away from the real world.’

Mr Cameron was speaking about the incident to mothers invited to the Mum of the Year awards at Number 10, when asked what he will do after his life in politics.

Cameron had spent 30 minutes in the lambing shed with the farmer and his partner Shen Paget before heading home for the evening.

Mr Tustian then got a call from the prime minister alerting him to a sheep he had spotted in the swamp with two lambs.

‘I got there and the three of them were 
pulling this ewe, and he [Cameron] was concentrating on getting this 
sheep out. He was covered in mud.

'I was glad he was there doing it, not 
me. It was very wet weather and getting dark.’

Mr Tustian said the death of the two lambs had been’ ‘the start of a bad year’ in which his farm had lost several lambs to the freezing Spring weather.

It is not the first time Mr Cameron has given him a helping hand with his sheep. In 2007 he acted as assistant to Mr Tustian while he delivered twin lambs which had become breached.

The Prime Minister helped him for a frantic 15 minutes with his pedigree ewe Patsy, as they had to push one of the lamb’s legs back in again.

One of the lambs survived, who was named David after him, and is now a stud ram. Mr Tustian said at the time: ‘He was very calm and knew just what he was doing.’
