Damian Ayles, from Twydall, Kent, was caught on camera defecating on his neighbours' doorstep as part of an unexplained vendetta against the family

A neighbour launched a revolting hate campaign against a 'tormented' family by defecating on their doorstep four times in the dead of the night.

Damian Ayles carried out the twisted act before posting used tissues through the family's letterbox.

The 23-year-old was only caught when his unnamed victims set up security cameras outside their home to catch the culprit.

It came after Ayles, from Twydall, Kent,  smeared excrement across the family's car as part of the unexplained vendetta.

The court heard how Ayles was too embarrassed to watch the footage of himself after being arrested by police. 

As the images were shown at Medways Magistrates' Court, Ayles also looked down at the floor with his hand over his mouth. His mother, who was sat in the public gallery, also looked away.  

Magistrates were told that Ayles first defecated outside the family's home in April last year, but that the victims did not go to the police. 

But the court heard how the same incident occurred again twice in September, prompting them to set up a security camera.

The CCTV finally caught Ayles carrying out the act again in the middle of the night on September 29.

Police then tracked Ayles down after finding traces of his DNA in the faeces, the court was told.

Prosecutor Debbie Jones said: 'The defendant can be seen at 3.30am on September 29 pulling down his trousers, moving to the squat position and having a poo.

'He then wipes himself and puts it (the dirty tissue) in the letterbox and smears some of the faeces on their vehicle.' 

Ayles pleaded guilty to harassment without violence and was given a two-year restraining order preventing him from going near the family.

He was also given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. Ayles was also ordered to pay the family £350 in compensation and £85 in court costs.

After the case a spokesman for the family said: 'I hope that the community service is cleaning up dog poo from children's playing parks.'

The court was told how the family, who have children, suffered stress and anxiety from the harassment and were left feeling unsafe in their home.

They also told police they had been unable to sleep after being 'tormented' by Ayles's prolonged campaign.   

Chair of the bench Mandy Samrai said: 'This was a very serious matter.' 

Wayne Crowhurst, defending, said Ayles had autism and had the mental age of a 13 year-old.

He said: 'He should not have done what he done and this is the end of the matter now, he wants to move on.'
