A landlord who found bags of meth stuffed inside the walls of his rental home says he couldn’t be more outraged after his horrifying report to police jailed him and his wife for two days.

Arriving to shattered glass and a door wide open, Michael Keeley of Lithonia, Georgia found his house ransacked along with the eight bags of meth pulled from hallowed pockets in the walls.

Police accused Mr Keeley and his wife of tampering with evidence, were arrested and told their 9-year-old son would be placed in protective services should no one volunteer to take the boy.

Outraged: Michael Keeley was accused of tampering with evidence after finding his rented home ransacked with bags of crystal meth stuffed into the wall space

Fortunately for the couple, a neighbor came to the rescue and looked after the child until family came.

'The mirror was here and this wall, I mean that space was taken out and there were drugs behind this wall,' Mr Keeley gestured in the house’s bathroom to WSBTV.

But that shock he said was only the beginning.

Calling police to report his find, it didn't take long until the tables turned to the officers’ skepticism of his claim.

'OK, come on, guy. Tell the truth. We know no one broke into your house,' he recalled one federal agent pressing him in a bedroom of the house to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'We know no one broke into your house. You did it yourself.'

In the kitchen he said his wife got the same treatment while outside their nine-year-old son was left crying in their car.

Trashed: Mr Keeley returned to find his home wrecked accused of lying by police

Wrongful: Mr Keeley and his wife were forced to spend two days behind bars after reporting the state of the rental home

'I will be forever reluctant of picking up the phone to call police again,' Mr Keeley said.

As if his frustration couldn’t get worse, it was only weeks ago that Mr Keeley's previous tenants living in the house were arrested for meth charges outside the property.

After federal agents with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security searched the house and gave the Keeleys an all clear to return to it, Sunday morning’s disastrous scene is what they returned to.

Cooperating with ICE agents Mr Keeley described touring them around his property, one in particular being an agent he had worked with during his last tenants' arrest and whom he had contacted directly on Sunday.

'I showed them where the back door was open, I showed them where the window was broken out. Then I walked down the hall [to the bathroom] and showed them where the drugs were,' he said.

It was after the agent he had previously been in contact with left, putting the scene in the hands of other officers, that he described the atmosphere changing against him.

'Who is this person you called? Who is this person you call?' Mr Keeley described the agents interrogating him after snatching up his cell phone.

To the rescue: Mr and Mrs Keeley's 9-year-old son was about to be taken into care before a neighbor offered to look after him before family arrived

Reeling: The couple are free after being bailed for $5,000 each. Mr Keeley said he was still in 'disbelief' after the incident

He said that most of the calls they asked about that morning were to the ICE agent he first reported the scene to.

After spending two days in a county jail, on Tuesday the couple both posted a $5,000 bond permitting their release.

'I feel like we were violated because we put our trust in you (the police) to protect us and you betrayed us,' he told WSBTV while returning to his house this week, still seen torn apart.

Despite their claims of innocence and wrong doing against them, the couple will still have to go to court to face their charges.

Little has pacified the family, however, with the only apology issued to them coming from the ICE officer who was at the scene before their arrest.

'He was apologetic. He said he did not authorize, he did not know, he had no knowledge that they were targeting us for arrest,' Mr Keeley said. 'He thanked me for being a help to them in the past.'

The case is being handled and investigated by ICE and not the Clayton County Police Department, according to a police spokesperson.
