A New York man who wandered into a McDonald's with a knife sticking out of his back on Tuesday says he was stabbed when he tried to break up a fight.

Andrew Hardy said he headed to the fast-food restaurant because he thought its security cameras would prevent his attacker from following him.

Customers inside the McDonald's quickly rushed to help Mr Hardy, who had blood pouring from his shirt and a kitchen knife still lodged in his back.

The 53-year-old had been due to meet his daughter at the cinema, but instead had to call and tell her he was injured.

Mr Hardy said that he called his daughter and told her: 'Yo, we might not be going to the movies. I got a knife sticking out my back.'

'She got hysterical, naturally ... but I
 still kept my cool because, if I had really got hurt, stabbed-stabbed, I
 would have really known that it had hit some vital. Sh*t, I got a cool 
demeanor,' he told the New York Post.

Customers inside the McDonald's described the stabbing as shocking, and said they tried to help Mr Hardy in case he fell on to his back and made the injury worse. 

‘I heard everybody screaming and it was a lot of commotion,’ Tromaine Yancey told CBS. ‘The guy came and he was standing there with a knife in his back and it was a kitchen knife.’

‘He
 was on the phone, I’m pretty sure he was on the phone talking to 
somebody in his family or a loved one, he was talking to them and 
telling them it might be the last time he’s speaking to them,’ Yancey added.

Mr Hardy claimed to have come across a fight, where two men had ganged up on a third person. He said he felt the knife go in him, but when he turned round his attacker had fled.

'When I felt [the knife], I just 
thought, "Get to safety", which was why I put myself in front of a 
camera, in case the dude come back at me,' he said.

Police have said they are confident they will catch the person responsible, but claimed to CBS New York that Mr Hardy was not being cooperative with their investigation.

It is believed that four people were involved in the fight last Tuesday, which happened close to the McDonald's that Mr Hardy went to for help.
