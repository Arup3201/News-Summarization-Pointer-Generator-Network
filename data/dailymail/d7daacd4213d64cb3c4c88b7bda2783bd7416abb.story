Mystery: Lord Lucan with his son, George Bingham, now the 8th Lord Lucan, who claims he has not seen his father since his disappearance in November 1974

The son of fugitive Lord Lucan today confirmed that he WAS sent on a trip to Africa, where it is claimed the missing Earl would watch him from a distance.

Speaking for the first time in years, George Bingham, the 8th Lord Lucan, said he remembers going to Kenya around 1985, but 'to his knowledge' he didn’t meet him in person.

It backs up claims of an aide to one of Lucan’s best friends, who said she was told to arrange the trip of George and his two sisters around 1980, six years after the Earl went on the run following the murder of the children's nanny.

The woman, who worked for John Aspinall and asked to be given an assumed name of Jill Findlay in an interview last month, said 'their father would observe them from a distance just to see how they were growing up.'In recent weeks, speculation has mounted over Lucan's whereabouts after three men - an former East End gangster 
and two engineers - claimed to have seen the missing Earl in bars in 
Africa following his disappearance.

Lord Lucan's brother, Hugh, has also spoken out to say he believes he might not be dead.

Speaking
to The Times about the Kenya trip, George Bingham said: 'Both my sisters were present as were two other 
families, neither of which had any connections to John Aspinall.

'The airline tickets, safari expenses and hotels, as regards myself, were paid for by my family trust.'

But he denies ever consciously meeting his father.

'I have not, to the best of my knowledge, seen my father since November 1974 [when he disappeared].'

He said claims to the contrary, which have been made in one newspaper, were defamatory.

'My father was declared legally dead by a High Court judge well over a decade ago.

'To suggest that I have met and spoken with my father... is to make a possible accessory, after the fact, to a grisly murder.

'It is to call me a criminal and it is thus a most serious libel.'

No contact: George (pictured with his father and mother, Lady Lucan) denies claims he has spoken to the Earl since his disappearance following the murder the family nanny

To add further speculation to the melting pot, Lord Lucan's widow, right, claims the missing Earl committed suicide the day after the nanny's murder on November 7, 1974.

The Countess of Lucan, 74, says she is convinced her husband boarded a ferry and 'jumped off mid-Channel in the way of the propellers'.

This, she said, was why his body was never found.

Lucan escaped the family home in Lower Belgrave Street in London after Lady Lucan ran crying to the nearby Plumber's Arms pub screaming: ‘Help me, help me, help me! He’s in the house! He’s murdered my nanny!’

She claimed he had killed Sandra Rivett, whose body was found tied up in a mailbag in the basement, and then attacked her.

Days later, Lucan's car was found at Newhaven in East Sussex.

Speaking to The Times, Lady Lucan said: 'The trail goes cold after his Ford Corsair was found in Newhaven. 

'There isn't much at Newhaven except for the sea and boats and so I believe that he boarded the ferry and jumped off mid-Channel in the way of the propellers, which is why his body was never found.'

Lucan vanished following the murder of his children's nanny on November 7, 1974.

After the attack, he went to the home of friends, telling them he had found the nanny had been murdered.

Three days later, his car was found abandoned in Newhaven, East Sussex, with bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping matching the one found in the Belgravia basement.

There was speculation he had committed suicide, but no body was found.

Last month, old East-End gangster Dennis Stafford insists he met the elusive aristocrat in Africa whilst on the run from authorities.

The former friend of the Kray twins 
says he came across Lord Lucan in the Monapatapa Hotel, in Harare, 
Zimbabwe, he believes, sometime between 1982 and 1983.

Engineers Lawrie Prebble and Ian 
Meyrick also came forward to say they are 'completely convinced' the man
they saw drinking in a hotel bar in Botswana with six friends is the 
legendary Lucan.

George Bingham has previously said 
his 'best guess' was that his father had contracted a burglar to raid 
the house in an insurance fraud. His father then discovered the macabre 
scene.

But now he appears less specific, according to The Times.

The
44-year-old, who was in the house along with his sisters Frances and 
Camilla at the time of the attack, told the paper: 'I still believe that
in this country, you are innocent until proven guilty by proper trial, 
not by inquest juries.'

George
Bingham followed his father into the world of banking before taking 
time off to research the mystery surrounding his father.

He said he now spends 'a lot of time' in North Africa, where he keeps a yacht.

Claims: Stafford claims he recognised Lord Lucan from the London club scene where both were regular faces

Mystery deepens: Stafford, left, pictured in 1957 being led away in handcuffs by a detective following his arrest, is the latest person to claim they have seen Lord Lucan, right

Following the latest flurry of findings and sightings, Ladbrokes has slashed the odds of Lord Lucan's being found alive this year.

The bookies now say the odds of Lord Lucan officially being found alive in Africa is now 8/1, down from 16/1.

Ladbrokes
also offer a 20/1 chance he is brought back to the UK for sentencing 
this year and 12/1 that the mystery surrounding his disappearance is 
resolved once and for all, should he be confirmed as deceased.

Spokesman
Jessica Bridge said: 'The hunt for Lord Lucan continues. The odds 
suggest if fresh evidence keeps surfacing he might be found sooner 
rather than later.'

At
9.45pm, Lady Lucan, in great distress, burst into the Plumber’s Arms, 
the pub near her home in the exclusive area of Belgravia in central 
London.

With blood 
streaming from several wounds on her head, she cried: ‘Help me, help me,
help me! He’s in the house! He’s murdered my nanny!’

Lady Lucan, who was estranged from her husband, said he had killed their nanny and tried to kill her.

Police found the couple’s three 
children asleep in their beds, unharmed, and when they went to the 
basement they were greeted by a macabre scene.

There were rumours that Lucan's gambling friends John Aspinall (pictured) and billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith had helped him flee the country

The
basement lightbulb had been removed, but in the semi-darkness, officers
made out a pool of blood with a man’s footprint in it (a bloodied towel
was in a bathroom), a blood-stained length of lead piping and a mailbag
containing a body.

The body was that of Sandra Rivett, the children’s live-in-nanny, who was the same height and build as Lady Lucan.

According
to Lady Lucan - living apart from her husband and in a bitter custody 
dispute over their children - she’d gone into the house to look for the 
nanny, but was attacked by her husband, whom she recognised by his 
voice, before managing to flee.

When
she returned with police, Lucan was gone. After the attack, he went to 
the home of friends, telling them he had found the nanny had been 
murdered. He left his friends at 1.15am.

Three days later his car was found 
abandoned in Newhaven, East Sussex, with bloodstains on the front seat 
and a length of lead piping matching the one found in the Belgravia 
basement.

There was 
speculation that he had committed suicide, but no body was found. And 
there were rumours that his gambling friends John Aspinall and 
billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith had helped him flee the country.

Two
years later, Aspinall gave an interview in which he said that if Lucan 
had sought his help he would have given it unconditionally.

By then, the inquest into Sandra 
Rivett’s death had been held and Lucan was named as her murderer. The 
missing peer was declared legally dead in 1999.

Inscription: The engraved watch thought to belong to Lord 'Lucky' Lucan

The watch: Antiques dealer Cedrick 
Lincoln provided physical evidence to back up old claims when he found a watch 
engraved with Lord Lucan's name.

He bought the timepiece - apparently presented to Lucan as a gift
from friends at The Clermont Club in Mayfair, London - from a dealer who claims that it was discovered in a South African township.

The tickets:
Jill Findlay, a personal assistant to Lucan's friend John Aspinall, 
told the BBC that she arranged tickets for Lucan's children to travel to
Kenya and Gabon, so 'their father would observe them... just to see how they were growing up’, on at least two occasions.

The brother: Lucan's brother Hugh Bingham recently gave an interview in which said he was 'sure' the elusive 
aristocrat fled to start a new life after murdering his children's nanny
Sandra Rivett, 29, in Belgravia, south west London in 1974.

The Englishman in Goa: Duncan MacLaughlin, a former Scotland Yard detective, claimed to have traced Lucan to Goa, India. He found photos of a man bearing a striking resemblance to the fugitive. The man in the photos was known locally as Barry Halpin but died in 1996. The eccentric expat: In 2007, the New Zealand Herald reported claims that Lord Lucan was living in an old Land Rover outside the township of Marton. Neighbours suspected expat Roger Woodgate was the missing Lord. When confronted with the claims Mr Woodgate said: 'It's a load of old poppycock. For a start, I'm ten years younger than Lucan. I'm also five inches shorter. If anyone can see a likeness in me and him, I'm more than happy to let them dream on.'
