On a crowded Hong Kong train yet seemingly so alone, a young woman's face is illuminated by the glow of her smartphone - this is the image judged the year's best and grand prize winner in National Geographic Readers' Photos of the Year competition.

The image entitled A Node Glows in the Dark, shot by Brian Yen of Hong Kong, beat more than 9,200 other entries which include stunning images of wildlife, natural phenomena and snapshots of unique cultures to the US$10,000 (£6,400) top prize.

Submissions were made from over 150 countries with their subject matter just as diverse, capturing a vast array of the earth's rich tapestry across three categories - people, places and nature.

The National Geographic Readers' Photos of the year
Grand Prize winning photograph from Brian Yen is a single image statement on technology, modern life and how advances have impacted our lives. Yen said of his successful entry: 'She's a node flickering on the social web, roaming the Earth, free as a butterfly. Our existence is no longer stuck to the physical here; we're free to run away, and run we will'

A wildebeest jumps off a steep ledge at the Mara River in Tanzania's North Serengeti Nicole Cambre's shot, which won the Nature category

A shot of mist rising from Budapest's thermal spas at night by Tristan Yeo claimed the places honour while the premier nature image, by Nicole Cambre, features a wildebeest jumping off a steep ledge at the Mara River in Tanzania's North Serengeti.

Yet the winner came from a distinctly urban setting. 

'I feel a certain contradiction when I look at the picture,' said Yen. “On the one hand, I feel the liberating gift of technology. On the other hand, I feel people don’t even try to be neighborly anymore, because they don’t have to.'
