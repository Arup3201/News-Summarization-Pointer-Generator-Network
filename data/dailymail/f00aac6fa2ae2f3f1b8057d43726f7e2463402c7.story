Holidaymakers looking for a luxury break on a budget should also explore Thessaloniki or Bucharest, both cities where a stay a five-star hotel costs an average of £87 or £98 respectively per night, according to travel website kayak.co.uk.

A night at the The Met Hotel or The Nikopolis in Thessaloniki, Greece, for instance, will set travellers back £71 - while a luxury break at Florence’s Belmond Villa San Michele starts from £632.

London hotels were on top of the expensive cities list, with an average night at The Berkeley costing £750 – the equivalent of 11 nights at Thessaloniki’s Domotel Les Lazaristes where prices start from £67 per night.

Annie Wilson, UK Managing Director of KAYAK said: 'The star rating can be confusing as a universal standard, but the grey area is generally around the two to four star mark. 

'When you get into the five star league the playing fields level out and it is expected that the hotel will offer a range luxury rooms and suites and facilities.’
