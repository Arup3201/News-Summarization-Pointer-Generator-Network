In the swing: John Simpson, 63, has become the first patient in the UK to wear the C-Brace - allowing him to walk naturally for the first time in 40 years

Not so long ago bionic limbs were the stuff of TV science fiction dramas. 

But these days attaching robotic parts to human arms and legs is so advanced that they can even be used to improve a game of golf. 

The first exoskeletal brace marketed for leisure activities yesterday went on sale in Britain.

The £60,000 robotic support has been developed to help people with minor disabilities improve the way they walk or play sports.

Called the C-Brace, the device was yesterday demonstrated at a golf club in London by a 63-year-old man who had suffered polio as a child.

Designed to wrap around the lower leg, the machine can be used for walking, cycling or even roller blading.

The different activities are selected on a remote control and transmitted to the leg via wireless Bluetooth technology, which then carries out the actions that are needed for that particular sport.

The brace contains computers and sensors on the upper leg, sensing the movement of the muscles in the thigh and transferring them to the robotic knee support.

It reduces strain in the joint and generates the power needed for movement, enabling people with minor movement disabilities - such as those experienced after a stroke - to employ a full range of actions.

Bionic exoskeletons were developed over the last decade to rehabilitate people who had been paralysed.

First used by the US army, the first bionic suits were used to manipulate the bodies of disabled soldiers in order to stimulate their muscles.

They were remarkably successful, the computer-controlled suits replicating natural body motions and triggering the motor control people had lost in accidents or strokes.

The technology has now become so widely available that it is now available on general sale for the first time.

Perviously only available in hospitals as a rehabilitative tool, it is now cheap enough to offer to people to wear full time.

Orthotic firm Ottobock’s C-Brace was launched in the US last year, and yesterday was placed on sale in Britain.

Former sports manager John Simpson, 63, from south-west London, who strapped on the device at Wimbledon Golf Club yesterday, said: ‘It’s going to change my life.’

Polio left Mr Simpson’s nerves so damaged as a child he was unable to walk and despite multiple operations, physiotherapy and treatments, he has relied on a locked-leg brace to help him move around since he was 14.

He said: ‘For as long as I can remember, I’ve had to walk with a locked-knee, which is awkward, cumbersome and puts great strain on my lower back.

‘Over the years I tried new braces, supports and therapies, but nothing helped me walk and so I stuck with my original steel callipers.

‘The C-Brace is a revolution. I can walk naturally again, without fear that my leg will give way, leading to a fall. I can walk downstairs with a bent knee and without fear as the brace provides support intuitively.’

David Buchanan of Ottobock said: ‘This is the most exciting development in the orthotic industry in the last decade.

‘This is a device designed for people who don’t have the full control of their legs or can’t bear weight without collapsing.

‘It’s the first ‘swing-phase’ control orthosis, which means that the computer and sensors inside the device control the leg in space - just like the advanced prosthetic legs.

‘This means that it can help people walk, cycle... even play a round of golf, naturally and comfortably.’
