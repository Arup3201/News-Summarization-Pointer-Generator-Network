At least two people tried to break into a California juvenile detention facility in what investigators believe was unsuccessful attempt to free a teenager accused of stealing celebrity chef Guy Fieri’s Lamborghini.

The attempted jailbreak happened at Marin County Juvenile early Friday morning when staff heard banging on the walls and saw ‘at least two people out there with a sledgehammer,’ said Sheriff's Lt. Barry Heying.

The suspects fled on foot and then likely took off in a car before more than 40 deputies and other officers arrived at the scene and searched the buildings and neighborhood.

Investigators believe the suspects 
were trying to free Max Wade, who is charged with stealing Fieri's 
$200,000 yellow Lamborghini from a San Francisco car dealership in March
of 2011.

The San Rafael, California, teen also faces attempted murder charges for trying to gun down a couple in Mill Valley in April.

Wade has pleaded not guilty to charges
of attempted murder, vehicle theft, burglary and other crimes. Charged 
as an adult, he could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of all 
counts.

Wade turned 18 Friday and was 
scheduled to be transferred to the county's adult jail. Marin County 
Juvenile Hall only houses people under age 18.

Marin sheriff's Lt. Heying said that 
at about 4:35 a.m., probation employees at Juvenile Hall heard a loud 
banging sound on a wall on the south side of the facility's

Probation staff immediately evacuated 
all the young detainees while police scoured the surrounding area. The 
search was called off at 7:15am.

Investigators found holes cut into two
perimeter fences, a sledge hammer, bolt cutters and a damaged window at
Wade's cell, according to the Marin Independent Journal. They also 
discovered a backpack that contained a change of clothes.

At the time of the incident, Wade was 
the only high-security detainee of the 13 teens at the juvenile center, 
and the only person held in the part of the building that was targeted 
by the suspects, according to ABC.

Failed breach: Police believe someone tried to free Max Wade from Marin County Juvenile before his transfer to jail

Heavy duty: The suspects used a bolt-cutter and a sledgehammer, trying the breach the walls of the building where Wade had been staying

Authorities did not have evidence that
Wade helped plan the operation, but the investigation is ongoing. 
Prosecutors said he could face additional charges if he is linked to the
breach.

Wade has since been transferred to the Marin County Jail under heavy security. He is being held in lieu of $2million bail.

Michael Daly, the county's chief 
probation officer, said he plans to review security at Juvenile Hall, 
but said it's impossible to hammer through the building's reinforced 
concrete walls and extra thick windows.

Daly added that his staff heard the perpetrators hit the wall at least 15-20 times, but failed to breach it. 

‘Everyone should know it's not very easy to break into a detention facility,’ he said.

Police are now reviewing recorded 
conversations that Wade had had since 
he was brought to the center on April 28.

Escape plot: Besides the discarded tools, police said the suspects dropped a backpack with a change of clothes as they fled the scene

Police tracked down Wade 
after he attacked a 17-year-old girl and her 18-year-old boyfriend in a 
brazen drive-by shooting from atop a motorcycle. Two weeks after the 
assault, he asked the girl out on a date -- and a chance to ride in 
'his' Lamborghini, according to police.

Officers
arrested the Wade when the girl tipped off police. They were waiting 
for him when he went to his storage locker in Richmond, California, to 
pick up the car. Police discovered evidence there that also implicates 
him in four bank robberies across northern California.

In February, police say Wade broke 
into a vacant hilltop mansion that overlooked the San Francisco Bay. He 
invited 50 friends from his high school and told them the scenic escape 
was his, the San Jose Mercury News reported. 

When cops showed up, he fled.

Aftermath: Since the incident, Wade has been transferred to Marin County Jail under heavy security

Officers
believe Wade stole the rare Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder from a San 
Francisco car dealership by rappelling from roof with 
ropes and cutting off the locks on the doors. He left behind 
mountaineering equipment after fleeing with the supercar.

Happy Guy: Fieri had thanked law enforcement officials for 'cracking the case' and catching the person suspected of stealing his luxury car

Fieri
co-owns five restaurants in California and is the host of several 
cooking shows, including Food Network's 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.' 
He is a noted collector of classic American muscle cars.

Wade, who is charged as an adult, hid the car in a storage locker for more than a year. Police spotted it leaving San Fransisco via the Golden Gate Bridge, but could never track it past that.

When officers arrested him, he tried to run and reached into his waistband, where he had stashed a loaded Glock semiautomatic pistol, $1,500 cash and fake IDs from three states, the San Fransisco Chronicle reported. 

Along with Fieri's Lamborghini, police found a troubling trove of gear, including an assault shotgun and an AK-47 assault rifle.

He also had cell phone jammers, police radio scramblers and the scanner frequencies for several California police departments.

Police found a full San Fransisco Police Department uniform, including a duty belt and badge.

A mask that officers discovered could link him to four bank robberies that were carried out this spring and winter in northern California.
