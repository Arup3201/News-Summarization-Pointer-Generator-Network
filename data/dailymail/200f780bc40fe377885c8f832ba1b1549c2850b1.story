Computerised lorry convoys which are controlled by just one driver are set to be tested on British roads next year.

The lorries would be  electronically linked together, meaning the driver of the front vehicle could control the acceleration, braking and steering of  the others.

It would allow whole ‘road trains’ of lorries to travel long distances on motorways with only a few yards between  each vehicle.

During the trial, trucker Hans Luft was relaxing with his hands behind his head while at the wheel of his 40-tonne heavy goods vehicle. Similar technology is expected to be tested in Britain next year

While the other lorries in the line 
would still have dedicated drivers, the automated system would allow 
them to ‘switch off’ for most of the journey.

In
 an emergency, or at busy junctions, the drivers of  the follow-on 
lorries would  be able to retake control of  their vehicles.

Backers
 of the proposal say the system would allow drivers to use their laptop,
 read  a book or ‘sit back and enjoy a relaxed lunch’. They also say 
platoons would cut down on road congestion and cut  fuel consumption by 
about  10 per cent.

The fuel
 efficiency – and therefore lower running cost – of the lorry convoy is 
due to the reduced aerodynamic drag caused by its streamlined formation.

But
 motoring organisations criticised the idea, warning the convoys may 
intimidate other drivers and block cars from entering and exiting 
motorways.

Tests are due to be held on tracks in Britain, and if  successful could be extended to quieter motorways at  night time.

The 'road trains' of lorries have been announced after it emerged last month that driverless cars, like the ones pictured, could be driving on British roads as of next year

Further
 trials would then be carried out on motorways which are heavily 
congested to test how well the automated system works in practice.

The
 vehicles would communicate via wi-fi, so that if the lead vehicle 
changes speed, the others follow suit. In addition, the movements of the
 entire convoy would be monitored by laser sensors and infrared cameras.

News of the British tests 
comes after Daimler announced last month that it had run an autonomously
 driven truck on a closed section of the German autobahn.

Swedish
 lorry maker Scania has also been testing platoons on Swedish roads 
since 2012. This latest plan, devised by the Department for Transport, 
follows a trip by officials to Sweden to study the system.

Their
 report concluded that similar trials in Britain would be feasible and 
ministers are expected to give the green light for them to start next 
year.

Earlier this month it was revealed that Google has begun lobbying the state of California to allow it to test driverless motorbikes, like the one pictured, and trucks on its roads

A government source 
told the Sunday Times: ‘There are potential benefits, notably reduced 
costs for haulage firms and reduced congestion for motorists, so there 
is sense in looking into it.

‘Equally we have to be cautious and ensure that safety isn’t compromised in any way.’

Paul
 Watters, head of roads and transport policy at the AA, said: ‘It’s a 
complicated one and road users will naturally have concerns about it.

‘If the lorries are following each other closely, it might be hard to spot the road signs on the near side of the motorway.

‘Putting it into practice would mean a complete re-design of the signage system.

‘It would also make exit  and entry very difficult on motorways, so the convoys would have to separate at every junction.

‘These ideas always need to be looked at, but at this stage I can see some pitfalls.

‘Motorways are the safest roads we have, and we wouldn’t want to do anything to jeopardise that.’
