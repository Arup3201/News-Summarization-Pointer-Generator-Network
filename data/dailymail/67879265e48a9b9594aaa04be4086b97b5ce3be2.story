Daniella Helayel, pictured here in 2010, announces her departure from Issa today

A label that has gone from strength to strength bids goodbye to its founder and designer after nine years.

The reason for the split was reported to be by mutual agreement, and not acrimonious.

A source close to the company said that both sides had been unhappy for a while, so Helayel’s departure did not come as a surprise.

'The time has come for me to move on to 
focus on my art, travel and other interests,' said Helayel in a statement released today.

'Creating Issa has been one
of the most rewarding things in my life. I may be leaving, but the Issa
girl will live forever in my heart.'

Helayel will leave the brand at the end of the year.

Her departure comes two years after Camilla Al Fayed, daughter of Harrods mogul Mohamed, bought a 51 percent stake in the company to develop the Issa brand globally.

Helayel was the minority shareholder.

The fashion brand,  which reflected the effortless elegance and laid-back spirit of 
Brazilian lifestyle, became a Royal favourite after Kate 
Middleton wore one of her blue dresses to announce her engagement to 
Prince William in 2011.

The Duchess has worn her designs on countless occasions since.

The label just revealed 
collaborations with Banana Republic and The Outnet, alongside plans to 
open its first standalone boutique in Brazil to follow on from the first
that opened recently in Tokyo - so Helayel's departure comes at a particularly busy time for the brand.

Helayel's successor Blue Farrier, 
who will take on the position of creative director at the end of the 
year, studied at Central Saint Martins and boasts a sparkling CV.

Past workplaces include Stella McCartney and a six year stint at Chloé. 

Angelina
Ypma, Issa London CEO said: 'I am delighted to welcome Blue as the new 
Creative Director of Issa at such an exciting time.

Her vision and 
passion will be vital as we expand into new categories and markets and 
continue the development of Issa into a truly global lifestyle brand.'

Blue
Farrier added: 'It is an exciting time to join Issa. I'm looking 
forward to working with the Issa London team in developing the brand to 
reach its full potential.'
