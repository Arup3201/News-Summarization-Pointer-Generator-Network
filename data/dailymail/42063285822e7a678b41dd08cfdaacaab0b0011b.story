The city that once covered half of its $1million budget with speeding ticket fines and other 'police revenue' is disbanding its department.

The Waldo City Council voted 4-1 on Tuesday to dissolve the police force after both the police chief and his replacement were suspended over allegations that included ticket quotas.

The decision to disband Waldo's police is partly due to the estimated costs of modernizing the department's facilities and computer systems, which investigations triggered by corruption allegations showed were outdated.

Scandal: Former police chief Mike Szabo resigned following a scandal over a speeding ticket quota and an investigation into police misconduct

Waldo had been one of two towns designated by the American Automobile Association as a 'traffic trap,' meaning that it considered law enforcement practices to be more focused on generating revenue than enforcing safe driving behavior.

Investigated: Police Chief Mike Szabo sent emails telling officers to follow an illegal quota for speeding tickets

The Gainesville Sun reports in August, five officers came forward with allegations that Police Chief Mike Szabo enforced a quota of 12 tickets for every 12-hour shift. 

'Looks like you have some work to do when you come in,' Szabo wrote in an email after an officer recorded only four tickets one day, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Szabo was suspended shortly after by City Manager Kim Worley after the Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation into another alleged violation of police procedure.

His replacement, Cpl Kenneth Smith, stepped in, only to be hit with a FDLE investigation and suspension of his own. 

Smith was accused of using city video equipment to monitor his apartment and had a penchant for stealing towels at expensive hotels he enjoyed on the city's dime. 

Both Smith and Szabo resigned following their suspensions. 

After the vote, Officer Brandon Roberts was in good spirits for a man who had lost his job to his corrupt supervisors.

Stay away: AAA called Waldo a 'traffic trap,' accusing police of ticketing for revenue generation, not safety of motorists

'If I took down two bad ones, it was worth it,' he said.   

The town will now rely on the Alachua County Sheriff's Department for police services.
