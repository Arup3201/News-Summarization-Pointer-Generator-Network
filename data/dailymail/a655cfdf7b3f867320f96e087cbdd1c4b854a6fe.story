It's a job that's meant to take just four minutes a day, but even that can feel like a drag.

Now, one company has made a 3D printed toothbrush tailored to an individual's teeth that promises a thorough clean in just six seconds.

The Blizzident doesn't look like a conventional toothbrush - in fact, it resembles a mouth guard.

Instead of brushing, the device is placed on the surface of the teeth and the user bites on the device.

The Blizzident (pictured) does not look like a mouthguard with bristles. It is placed on the surface of a person's teeth and allows the user to bite on the device and grind their teeth to clean them. Some of the 400 bristles are visible

They then grind their teeth to clean them, instead of using a motion associated with conventional brushes.

The company uses a 3D model of an individual's teeth created using an impression or scan made by a dentist to print the device, which costs around £122.

The device itself is made of plastic and contains 400 soft bristles as well as slits for dental floss.

The bristles are soft and tapered as well as being tailored to teeth to brush along the gumline at a 45 degree angle so that users brush their teeth by biting and grinding for around six seconds.

By biting the brush using what dentists call the 'modified bass' technique, users clean the gingival sulcus - the space underneath the gum line - particularly well as well as 'cleaning all other surfaces perfectly,' according to the company.

The unusual brush has 400 bristles set at a 45 degree angle to clean below the gum line - and every tooth surface - when a user grinds their teeth and bites on the device in quick succession. The handle of the brush is a floss dispenser and there are small slots so floss so that the device cleans in-between teeth too

To clean teeth throughly, a user must bite and release the device quickly 10 to 15 times, which creates a 'vibrating, jiggling upwards, downwards and slightly circling movements', according to the firm.

The resulting 'sub gingival bass technique' is easy to achieve using the tailor-made device but is difficult to master using a conventional handheld brush.

Users of the Blizzident should also grind their teeth with their mouths closed to brush according to the 'fones' technique to clean the top surface of their molars, the company said.

To clean teeth throughly, a user must bite and release the device quickly 10 to 15 times, which creates a 'vibrating, jiggling upwards, downwards and slightly circling movements'. It also has a little brush in the centre (pictured in the circle) to clean a user's tongue

The website says: 'Because you are brushing all your teeth 
at the same time, you are brushing extremely quickly. You brush all the 
difficult-to-reach and inter-dental regions without even having to think 
about it.'

There are slits for dental floss that users can route through the innovative brush so they are 'perfectly positioned for an individual's inter-dental regions' so that when they bite and grind, they are flossing at the same time.

The handle of the brush also doubles as a floss dispenser, while there is also an in-built tongue cleaner, that scrapes bacteria off the tongue while the brush is in use.

The company claims that six seconds of brushing time with the Blizzident is equivalent to a three minute clean with a conventional toothbrush, which relies on a user's brushing technique

While the device is expensive, at around £122, compared to manual toothbrushes, it has 400 bristles, which is roughly 10 times as many as an ordinary toothbrush, leading the company to claim it lasts 10 times longer - or roughly one year.
