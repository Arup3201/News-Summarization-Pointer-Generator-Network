Qatar lifted a travel ban on Tuesday against an American couple cleared in the starvation death of their eight-year-old adopted daughter. 

U.S. officials put pressure on Qatar's government to  allow Los
Angeles couple, Matthew and Grace Huang, to return home.

An appeals court threw out
convictions linked to the death of their African-born adopted
daughter, Gloria, after finding that a lower court had made
errors in the case.

However, on Sunday, the couple's passports were seized at Doha airport
as they sought to leave the Gulf Arab state after a new arrest warrant was issued.

However U.S. Ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, said on Tuesday that the travel ban had been lifted and the couple would be leaving for the U.S. on Wednesday. 

Secretary of State John Kerry had swiftly issued a statement
saying he was deeply concerned over the complications after Qatari officials refused to allow the couple to leave on Sunday.

On Monday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the U.S. ambassador to Qatar had visited with the
couple on Sunday and had been in touch with Qatari officials to
get the travel ban lifted.

On Monday, a lawyer for the couple filed an application
requesting the travel ban be lifted. 

The application
was presented to the attorney general's office in Doha, a family spokesman said.

The Huangs were arrested in January 2013 after an autopsy
found their daughter died of 'cachexia and dehydration'. Cachexia is an irreversible loss of body mass.

They were charged with 'murder with intent by forced
starvation' and convicted in April.

The couple said Gloria had suffered from
malnutrition-related diseases since they adopted her from Ghana
at aged four. 

A website created to publicize the case said the Huangs had
moved to Qatar so Matthew, a Stanford-trained engineer, could
work on a project related to the 2022 World Cup.

Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare in  Qatar where the family had been living while Matthew Huang, a Stanford-trained engineer, worked on a project related to the 2022 World Cup

The Huangs have two other African-born adopted children and have been pressing Qatari officials unsuccessfully for permission to leave the country to be with them. 

'It has been a long and emotional trial for me and my family, and Grace and I want to go home and be reunited with our sons,' Matthew Huang said shortly after the ruling. 

'We have been unable to grieve our daughter.' 

Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare in Qatar, which has aggressively pursued a higher international profile through sporting events and overseas investments.

A report by Qatari police earlier raised questions about why the Huangs, who are of Asian descent, would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits'.

It also suggested that the children could have been part of a human trafficking operation or were bought for organ harvesting, according to the family's website. 

Gloria was severely malnourished when she was younger and would at times refuse to eat for several days before binge eating or getting food from unusual places, such as garbage cans or from strangers, according to a report prepared in the U.S. by Janice Ophoven, a pediatric forensic psychologist who reviewed the case for the family.

The report noted that such unhealthy anorexic eating patterns are not uncommon in children adopted from impoverished backgrounds, and was a behavior the girl's parents were trying to manage and correct.

The report also noted that Gloria had previously been treated for an intestinal parasite, and said recent blood tests could have indicated she suffered from an underlying bone marrow condition, as well as a vitamin D deficiency.

On Sunday the appeals court ruled the couple were not guilty and said they were free to leave Qatar, based on witnesses' accounts that Gloria was 'not neglected in leading a normal life.'

In the appeals court hearing, the witnesses had testified that they saw Gloria eating one day before her death, the presiding judge said as he issued the verdict.

'This negates the charge that she was prevented from eating, a charge that the court of first instance used as a base for its initial ruling,' the judge said.

The court also cited a statement by Gloria's brother, Immanuel, who testified that the parents had provided food to their children.

A forensic pathologist told court last month that Gloria's corpse showed signs that she had not eaten for days.

'I found no signs of food in her stomach and the whole intestine, and I found no other reasons for death,' said the expert Anees Mahmud.

But the Huangs have insisted that Gloria died of an eating disorder rooted in a troubled early childhood.
