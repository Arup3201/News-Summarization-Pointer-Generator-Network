Joran van der Sloot, the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway, has been moved to a remote Peruvian penitentiary after authorities said he threatened to kill the warden of the prison where he was serving a 28-year term for murder.

Peruvian prison spokeswoman Janeth Sanchez told The Associated Press that the 27-year-old Dutchman was moved Sunday to Challapalca, located high in the Andes near the Bolivian border. He previously was held at a prison north of Lima.

Van der Sloot was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to Aruba. He is imprisoned for killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old Peruvian business student in 2010.

He married his pregnant Peruvian girlfriend in a prison ceremony last month.

Prison officials prohibited video and photos during the midday nuptials and none of the groom's relatives attended, said his attorney, Maximo Altez.

Wearing a tailored suit and dress shoes sent by his mother, Van der Sloot told his bride, who is eight months pregnant, that after he is released from prison, 'I want to marry you again,' and she told him the same,' said John Barrera, who officiated the wedding as mayor of the city of Ancon, where his former prison is located.

The blushing bride showed off her growing baby bump in a conservative white ‘mullet’ dress paired with a matching shawl. To complete her wedding day look, Figueroa wore a flower in her hair.Van der Sloot met and fell in love with Figueroa while she was selling goods inside the prison, according to his attorney.

Speaking to reporters outside the prison, Altez showed an oil painting given to him by Van der Sloot depicting a tall, solitary woman in a red dress on a palm-studded beach under a radiant sun.

The attorney, who acted as a witness during the ceremony, was one of only four people in attendance, among them another lawyer and the bride’s mother.

Van der Sloot was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot.

In 2011, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student, five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance.

Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for payment.

The newlyweds met at the prison, where Figueroa, an accountant by training with a young son from a previous relationship, sells candy and cigarettes to inmates.

'They became friends and spent a lot of time together in his cell,' Altez told CNN earlier this year. 'Unlike the United States, here in Peru, loved ones or relatives can see inmates inside their jails.'Figueroa is due to give birth to Van der Sloot's child in September. All prisoners at the penitentiary are allowed conjugal visits, explaining Figueroa's pregnancy.

Peruvian media have floated the possibility that Van der Sloot decided to get married to avoid extradition to the U.S. at the end of his prison term.

But his attorney has dismissed the suggestion that the nuptials were a calculated move.‘He's getting married because he's in love and is having a child,’ Altez said in May. ‘There are no hidden agendas.’

Leidy Figueroa told CBS News' Crimesider earlier this year that she usually visits Van der Sloot twice a week and brings him home-cooked meals.

According to the bride, the convict has become a new person and is enjoying his prison arts and crafts classes.

Van der Sloot is currently in prison for confessing to killing 21-year-old business student Stephany Flores at a Lima casino in 2010. He was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2012.

Van der Sloot is also suspected of killing 18-year-old Holloway, who vanished during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005 and was last seen with him and another man.

The Alabama teen's body has not been found and Van Der Sloot has denied involvement in her disappearance.

More than two decades from now, Van der Sloot will face charges in the U.S. for accepting $25,000 from Holloway's mom to lead her to the girl's body, something he never did.Van der Sloot has been spending his sentence teaching English to other inmates and painting.
