Doctors treating stricken Formula One legend Michael Schumacher have reportedly abandoned their attempts to bring him out of his artificial coma following setbacks.

German news magazine Focus - which enjoys a close relationship with the 45-year-old's inner circle - claims the slow waking-up process for the seven-time world champion was put on hold last week.

Schumacher has lain in an artificially induced coma since December 29 in the University Hospital of Grenoble in France after seriously injuring his head during a low-speed ski accident the same day.

Doctors announced three weeks ago that they were reducing the anaesthetic keeping him under to slowly bring him around.

Now,
 according to Focus, that has been halted because of 'complications' 
although just what those problems are has not been announced.

Official
 news about Schumacher's condition is scant with the family preferring 
only to issue the briefest of bulletins every few weeks.

The
 latest claim will only add to the concerns of fans worldwide that the 
severity of his brain trauma is causing experts concern every step of 
the way on his torturous road to recovery.

Focus said that, for now, the recovery phase is back on ice and Schumacher is once again medicated to keep him under.

The
 process was initiated because his  brain injury was so severe doctors 
needed to suppress its normal functions to allow it to operate at 
low-speed and, hopefully, recover more quickly.

Hope: Felipe Massa has claimed he saw Schumacher's mouth move as he spoke to him

Optimism: Massa says he told 'sleeping' Schumacher all about his car and prospects for the coming season

Only last week, his former Ferrari colleague Felipe Massa had visited Schumacher in hospital and spoken to him.

'He sleeps but looks quite normal,' he said. 'I think he even reacted a bit.'

Doctors
 may have decided to break off his awakening for a variety of reasons, 
including reduced blood flow, a new infection or signals that the drugs 
lying in the fatty tissue of his body were not shifting as fast as they 
would have hoped.

Just a 
fortnight ago he contracted, and fought off, a bout of mild pneumonia contracted through the breathing tubes keeping him alive.

Now with the latest news the fear is that his hopes of making a complete recovery are dimmer than ever.

Legend: Schumacher is one of the greatest drivers to ever grace a Formula One track

His
 wife Corinna, 44, and teenage children Gina-Marie and son Mick are 
constantly at his bedside, talking to him throughout the day when he is 
massaged, turned and cleaned while hooked up to a bank of machines 
keeping him alive.

They are said to be deeply troubled at the latest turn of events.

It
 emerged last week that Schumacher was involved in a road accident with a
 motorbike rider in Spain just weeks before his horror ski crash.

The
 Formula 1 driver was allegedly driving a hire car when he knocked 
the man off his bike when he failed to give way at a roundabout.

A
 court is still looking into the crash in Seville on November 17. The 
motorcyclist apparently broke his wrist when hit by Schumacher’s rented 
Audi A4.

The case is not expected to go to trial as the racing driver's insurer will pay compensation.
