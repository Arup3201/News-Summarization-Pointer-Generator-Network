Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin is in line for a new contract following his breakthrough into the first-team.

The Gunners want to tie the right-back down to a new long-term deal after a string of impressive displays in replacing the injured Mathieu Debuchy.

Bellerin's current deal expires in 2017, but he is now set to extend his stay at the Emirates Stadium.

The young defender is now a key part of Arsene Wenger's first team squad after some impressive displays

It is common practice at Arsenal to hand improved contracts to young players who make a consistent impact on the first-team.

The 19-year-old has made 17 appearances for the club already this season, firmly establishing himself as a regular member of Arsene Wenger's first-team squad.

The news casts further doubt over Carl Jenkinson's career at the Emirates Stadium.

With Mathieu Debuchy out injured, Bellerin has become the club's reliable full back ahead of Calum Chambers

The right-back is currently on loan at West Ham, with the east London club are keen to turn his deal permanent.

And the emergence of Bellerin, as well as last summer's capture of Debuchy, has pushed Jenkinson further down the pecking order at Arsenal.

And the Gunners are likely to listen to offers for the full-back at the end of the season.
