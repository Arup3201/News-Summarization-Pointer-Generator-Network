A convicted terrorist who disabled himself after going on hunger strike in jail yesterday defeated two Britons to claim a swimming silver.

Spanish athlete Sebastian Rodriguez Veloso, a former member of Communist terror group Grapo, finished second in the 50m freestyle sprint.

The 55-year-old was sentenced to 84 years in jail in 1984 for his part in the murder of a business leader and a bombing campaign.

Determined: Spanish athlete Sebastian Rodriguez Veloso, a former member of Communist terror group Grapo, finished second in the 50m freestyle sprint

During his time behind bars, he staged a 432-day hunger strike and was only kept alive after being force fed.

His extended protest damaged several of his organs and left him paralyzed from the waist down.

After being released from jail early in 
1996, he began swimming, and has since won 13 medals in the Sydney, 
Athens, Beijing Paralympic games.

Yesterday he defeated Britons Anthony 
Stephens from Reading, who finished sixth, and Andrew Mullen from 
Glasgow who came eight in the final.

Veloso,
from Cadiz in southern Spain, rarely speaks of his crimes for which he 
received an official pardon in 2007 from the Spanish cabinet following 
his great sporting success.

The father of a 19-year-old daughter has said he wants to be judged on his successes as a swimmer not for his past.

He has said: ‘The past cannot be erased.’ He also gives talks at schools on the values of solidarity, achievement and camaraderie that the sport provides.

Yesterday, he praised the atmosphere and welcoming he received at London 2012, saying: ‘It’s amazing.

‘You are making us feel like what we aim to be, like what we are, like what we hope in future will be increasingly accepted that we are, like 100 per cent sportspeople.'
