Former Home Secretary Leon Brittan was only questioned over allegations he raped a student in 1967 following demands by the Director of Public Prosecutions, it has been claimed.

Alison Saunders is understood to have insisted the Metropolitan Police re-investigate claims Lord Brittan raped a 19-year-old woman at his London flat in 1967 because no questions were asked at the time.

Lord Brittan was in his late 20s and not yet an MP at the time of the alleged incident, with police saying the woman originally made a complaint in late 2012.

Today Lord Brittan released a statement confirming he was interviewed by police in relation to a 'serious allegation', but insisted that the allegation was 'wholly without foundation'.

Denial: Lord Brittan (pictured leaving his North Yorkshire home this morning) has released a statement confirming he was interviewed by police, but insisted that the allegation was 'wholly without foundation'

The Metropolitan Police only investigated claims Lord Brittan raped the student after the Director of Public Prosecutions demanded to know why he wasn't questioned when the alleged victim came forward, investigative news website Exaro claimed.

As a result of Saunders' intervention, officers questioned Lord Brittan under caution in June at his solicitor's office and the allegations are now  being investigated by officers from the Metropolitan Police’s Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command.

Saunders is believed to have looked into the case herself after the campaigning Labour MP Tom Watson wrote to her asking that she examine the way the police handled the case.

The Metropolitan Police has now replaced the officer in charge of the investigation, Exaro claims.

This morning Lord Brittan released a statement confirming he had been questioned by police in June, but denying the allegations.

'It is true that I have been questioned by the police about a serious allegation made against me. This allegation is wholly without foundation,' he said.

In his statement Lord Brittan also referred to an 'explosive' dossier containing historic child abuse allegations against at least eight public figures was compiled by ex-Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens, who died in 1995.

The 114 files now known to have been 
either lost or destroyed, fueling fears of a cover-up at the heart of 
the establishment.

'I would like to put on record that I welcome the fact that there is now to be an independent review to look at the missing files belonging to the Home Office,' he said.

'It has been alleged that when I was Home Secretary I failed to deal adequately with the bundle of papers containing allegations of serious sexual impropriety that I received from the late Geoff Dickens MP,' he added.

This too is completely without foundation... I passed this bundle of papers to the relevant Home Office officials for examination, as was the normal and correct practice,' Lord Brittan went on to say.

This morning Prime Minister David Cameron said there would be 'no stone unturned' by an independent inquiry into how institutions handled allegations of child abuse, adding that it was 'vital' to find out the truth of what happened and to learn lessons.
