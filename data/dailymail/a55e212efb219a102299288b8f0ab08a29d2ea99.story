NSW Labor leader Luke Foley is campaigning to be the state's new Premier 

A political party's attempt to use LOL cat memes as part of their election campaign has backfired after social media users pointed out they should be focusing on policy not comedy.

NSW Labor, whose leader Luke Foley is campaigning to win the upcoming state election, posted a series of cat memes targeted at Liberal Premier Mike Baird on Saturday which they renamed 'Caturday'.

But the party's Facebook fans were quick to point out cat memes had ‘become a bit passé’ and blasted ‘get your message across in an adult way, as it is adults who vote’.

One meme showed two cats yawning with the tagline: ‘Mike Baird says prices won’t go up. LOL.’

Another showed a grumpy looking cat with the line: ‘Electricity privatisation… no.’

While a cute post showed a cat and a kitten cuddling with the words: ‘Labor is investing in schools for your little one.’

One fan of the NSW Labor party page, Sammy Yousef, wrote: ‘This is the best you’ve got? Freakin’ lolcats? That’s your counterargument? 

'You have the easiest job of any opposition in the history of this country and you’re being so idiotic about it there’s STILL a danger we’ll end up with LNP.’

On March 28, NSW residents will be required to vote for the 56th Parliament. 

Jason Muller commented: ‘Omfg how pathetic! Ur resorting to using cats to get votes!... Game over! Jesus Christ!’

Jenni May said: ‘Why the Hallmark cat ads? Aren’t you trying to sell intelligent political concepts. This approach will alienate all the “dog” people out there.’

'$1,000+ courses at TAFE? No thanks,' NSW Labor wrote alongside this cute kitten 

Kate Marksell called for less cat posts and more 'policy, policy, policy please'

'Take it from this cat - whatever Mike Baird tries to tell you, prices will go up when he sells off our electricity network,' NSW Labor said on Facebook 

The NSW Labor party used this sleeping kitten picture to illustrate how 'under Mike Baird, $3 billion has been ripped out of our healthcare system'

'Really cats? Is this what political debate in NSW has come too,’ Anthony Bosh wrote

Bev Little wrote: ‘No more cats environment not friendly.’

Kate Marksell instructed: ‘OK, I like cats but enough with the cats. Policy, policy, policy please.’

‘Yeah but honestly pictures of cats on them has become a bit passé,’ Peter Humble replied.

‘Most people aren’t posting pictures of their own cats anymore, text or no text. Whenever I see a cat come up in my newsfeed I’m like really?

‘Which one of my friends forgot to change their calendar over at the end of 2011. Then I look and see it’s the NSW Labor party. It’s 2015. Enough with the cats.’

NSW Labor said: 'Poll after poll shows that voters do not support Mike Baird's plan to sell off our electricity'

Colin Price added: 'This cat could literally lose you the election. And you were doing so well'

Sam Parker said NSW Labor has posted 'too many cat memes'

'NSW Labor has a plan to invest $1.3 billion into building and updating schools and TAFE,' they Facebook page claimed 

According to this grumpy cat post 'Mike Baird doesn't have a Plan B'

Natalie Roseworn commented: ‘Agree. Posting memes of cats does nothing to make you appear professional or progressive, both of which I presume you want to appear. Get your message across in an adult way, as it is adults who vote.’

Sam Parker joked: ‘Too many cat memes… purr real.’

Colin Price added: ‘This cat could literally lose you the election. And you were doing so well.’

‘Really cats? Is this what political debate in NSW has come too,’ Anthony Bosh wrote.

NSW Labor replied: ‘On Caturday? Yes.’
