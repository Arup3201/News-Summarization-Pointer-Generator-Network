It is one of the most iconic bridges in London and a symbol of the capital recognised throughout the world.

But Tower Bridge could have been replaced by a tunnel if design proposals submitted by a Victorian engineer had been chosen instead.

The extraordinary picture - which was the design of John Standfield - shows the landmark river crossing replaced by a tunnel with gothic towers on either side.

Engineer John Standfield's proposals in 1876 could have seen a tunnel underneath the River Thames instead of the iconic Tower Bridge

It dates from when the City Corporation was inviting proposals for a river crossing in 1876.

The oil painting of the cross-section shows the tunnel of remarkably low depth with hydraulic platforms at either end to lower horses and carts under the water.

Despite being almost inconceivable given Tower Bridge's now iconic status, the proposals by the member of the Institute of Civil Engineers were one of 50 serious submissions made to the City Corporation.

The painting is now to be auctioned by Christie’s where it is expected to fetch up to £4,000.

A modern makeover: The bridge was built to cope with the demand of pedestrians wanting to cross the river, and has now become a striking feature of the London skyline

Two piers were sunk into the river 
bed to support the construction and over 11,000 tons of steel provided 
the framework for the Towers and Walkways.

When it was built, Tower Bridge was 
the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever completed 
('bascule' comes from the French word for 'see-saw').

These bascules were operated by hydraulics, using steam to power the enormous pumping engines.

The energy created was stored in six 
massive accumulators, as soon as power was required to lift the Bridge, 
it was always readily available.

The accumulators fed the driving engines, which drove the bascules up and down. 

Tom Rooth, from Christie's, said: 'There were lots of schemes that were submitted to the City Corporation.

'And this was an artist’s impression of what John Standfield planned.

'It shows the ambition of the Victorians who believed that anything was impossible.'

Standfield's proposals were possibly inspired by the creation of the first tunnel to be built beneath the Thames between 1825 and 1843.

The Thames Tunnel, connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping, now forms part of the London Overground railway network.

London Bridge was originally the only crossing for the Thames, but as the size of the city bloomed more bridges were constructed.

These had to be built to the west of London Bridge, since the area east of the bridge had become a busy port.

But in the 19th century the east of London became so densely populated that pedestrians and vehicles were being delayed by hours, so a new bridge was planned in 1876.

It took 8 years, 5 major contractors and 432 construction workers to build Tower Bridge, which is built in Cornish granite and Portland stone.
