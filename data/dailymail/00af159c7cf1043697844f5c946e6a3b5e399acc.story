A crow found an unlikely saviour in a grizzly bear, when it ended up in a pond in its enclosure.

The bird had managed to fall into the water and was drowning when the grizzly discovered its plight and pulled it to safety.

The unusual Baywatch scene was filmed by a visitor at Budapest Zoo earlier this summer and uploaded to YouTube.

Hang in there: Vali the bear discovers a crow flailing in her pond at Budapest Zoo, and goes to investigate

In the short film, the bear is seen walking around near its pond, when it sees the flailing crow in the water.

The
 bear, a female named Vali, approaches the side of the pond, and after 
first attempting to pull it up with its paw, bites on to the crow’s wing
 and drags it out of the water.

The terrified crow nabs Vali in the nose, and she immediately lets go of the wing, and retires to her apples and carrots.

The bird appears in shock, lying on its back for a few seconds while panting.

Soon it manages to flip itself over on its feet and appears to be staring at Vali in surprise that she ‘saved’ it.

However, as noble as the act may appear on tape, Budapest Zoo commented on its website that the bird was lucky.

‘The female brown bear was probably just curious,

‘The
 bird is handled not too gently, and after pulling the shore, she lets 
immediately, because the crow had the presence of mind to give her a 
pinch on the nose.

‘After this, she lost interest in the prey, and went to munch on the apples and other delicacies.’
