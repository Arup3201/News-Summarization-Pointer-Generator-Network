A day after the government proudly declared it had met its weekend deadline for making HealthCare.gov operate smoothly for most users, it admitted Americans would still have problems enrolling online.

Aides to the president admitted Sunday that peak traffic volumes could make the site crash.

While saying HealthCare.gov had improved,
President Barack Obama's adviser Jeffrey Zients also warned that peak traffic volumes 
during the coming weeks could overwhelm it as consumers scramble to sign
 up before a December 23 deadline for coverage that begins January 1.

Could crash: Jeffrey Zients, standing here next to President Obama, admits that peak traffic volumes during the coming weeks could overwhelm the site as consumers scramble to sign up before a December 23 deadline

Networks of volunteer organizations are expected to resume enrollment activities after a long U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend, many of them with backlogs of would-be applicants waiting for access.

Enroll America, the nonprofit group that serves as a flagship for private sector enrollment efforts under Obama's landmark healthcare law, said it planned to launch a new 'Coverage is Coming' push, with more than 1,000 events over the next three weeks ranging from commemorations of World AIDS Day to community health summits and holiday toy drives, according to Enroll America spokesman Justin Nisly.

AIDS Alabama, a statewide non-profit organization that received a federal grant to help people enroll, had been relying largely on paper applications to sign people up until last week, when they noticed major improvement in the website, said Lauren Banks, the organization's director of policy and advocacy.

One glitch the organization came across last week involved apparently incorrect information about tax subsidies, Banks said.

For example, she said, people who appeared to be eligible for subsidies given their income levels were told they did not qualify.

On time: Healthcare officials said Sunday that they made the self-imposed deadline to make the Obamacare website usable for 50,000 applicants at one time

Banks said the organization planned a 
radio campaign as part of a push to get people enrolled by December 23 
so they could have coverage starting next year.

'We really are going to push super-hard the next 23 days to get people enrolled for the January 1st deadline,' Banks said.

The
 White House, which plans to hold public education events about the 
healthcare law throughout December, will hold a Youth Summit on 
Wednesday to help drive outreach and enrollment over the remaining 
four-month enrollment period.

The
 number who need coverage starting January 1 could include millions of 
uninsured Americans with preexisting health conditions and others who 
have been notified that their current health plans will expire at 
year-end because they do not meet Obamacare's standards for benefits and
 consumer protection.

Good news: According to the eight-page report released this morning, the website has made 'dramatic progress' in 'doubling' site capacity

Zients
 said on Sunday a five-week emergency 'tech surge' had doubled the 
capacity of the online health insurance portal that is crucial to 
helping people shop for insurance plans, while making it more responsive
 and less prone to errors.

The
 administration said the effort's key improvement was to increase 
HealthCare.gov's capacity to 50,000 simultaneous users, which would 
allow the site to handle a minimum of 800,000 users per day.

Officials
 acknowledged however that the site may not operate smoothly for some 
visitors even when the capacity has not been exceeded, and said they 
were still scrambling to repair and install functions at the crucial 
'back end' of the system that are needed to finalize enrollments with 
insurers.

'The real challenges remain, and that's downstream,' said Rick Howard, research director for the technology consultant Gartner.

'The
 real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate 
the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is.'

Craig
 Garthwaite, a health economist at Northwestern University's Kellogg 
School of Management, said Sunday's announcement represented 'dramatic 
progress', but that the fixes mainly brought the website to 'the 
baseline of what we need the site to be able to do'.

Officials
 are working to correct errors in the consumer enrollment data sent to 
insurers and have not built in several necessary functions, including 
one that will enable the government to pay federal subsidies to insurers
 on behalf of low-income enrollees.

Without
 those functions working properly, HealthCare.gov and websites for 14 
state-run marketplaces could have difficulty operating in 2014.

Even so, officials said, the site is dramatically better than when it was launched on October 1.

It
 was overwhelmed by users in a debacle that fueled Republicans' 
complaints about the Democratic president's healthcare overhaul and 
threatened to make his signature domestic achievement a drag on 
Democrats heading into the 2014 elections.

The
 Zients team's success could mark a more upbeat chapter for the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

The law is designed to help provide coverage to millions of uninsured and under-insured Americans.

Longer-term
 questions remain about whether the program will be able to enroll the 
estimated 7 million people it needs by the end of March to be 
financially viable, including millions of healthy, young enrollees who 
are needed to keep the program's costs in check.

'The
 issue is really the management capacity of the Obama administration,' 
said Robert Blendon, a Harvard expert on healthcare and public opinion.

'If
 the website really is still working a week from now, it'll make people 
feel at least they have the capacity to turn things around and move 
ahead.'
