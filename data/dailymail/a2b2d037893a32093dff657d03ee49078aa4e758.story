At least 29 people have been killed by Syrian government airstrikes in the Islamic State stronghold city of Raqqa. 

Eight blasts tore through the north eastern region today as President Assad's army takes further steps to regain control from the extremist group. 

Nine IS fighters are thought to have been killed alongside 20 civilians, most of whom died when a missile struck a crowded bakery.

Syrian government air strikes killed at least 29 people in the Islamic State stronghold city of Raqqa today 

Images and footage posted on social media and the Raqqa Media Centre  showed rubble-filled streets in the north eastern city

Videos of the destruction were uploaded to social media websites accompanied, in one case, with the chilling observation of one activist who said: 'Raqqa is being silently slaughtered'. 

Most of the dead were killed after the first blast which struck the Andalous bakery, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 

Abu Ibrahim, an activist posting on a media collective, said one local morgue was inundated with charred bodies, making formal identification difficult. 

He added eight members of the same family died in the strikes.

The Raqqa Media Centre uploaded a video of the aftermath showing hollowed cars and ravaged buildings. 

It comes as Iraq's air force struck a hospital in an Islamic State-controlled town, killing seven patients and wounding 22 others. 

The attack near Kirkuk city is one of a series of raids by war aircraft in the area according to witnesses.   

Few journalists have been able to access conflict-torn Raqqa since IS fighters took hold of the city, home to an estimated 500,000 people, earlier this year.

Residents fight to extinguish a fire after eight explosions tore through the region on Saturday 

Twenty civilians died in the blasts, with the majority thought to have been killed when a missile struck a busy bakery 

The city has been largely cut-off from the world's media after being taken by IS fighters earlier this year. Residents examine the sky for military aircraft after today's strikes 

The mother of a Lebanese soldier claims her son is the second to have been beheaded by IS militants after seeing photographs of the apparent execution online.

Zeinab Noun said her 20-year-old son, Abbas Medlej, was 'sacrificed' after supporters of the militant Sunni group posted images celebrating his death on Twitter.  

Medlej was among a group of 19 Lebanese soldiers taken captive after the extremist group stormed a border town earlier this month. 

His captors claim to have killed him when he tried to escape after pretending to go to the bathroom. 

A caption posted with the images on a Twitter account used to publish Islamic State statements named the soldier as Abbas Medlij, identifying him as a Shiite Muslim. 

His mother urged revenge on the militant group, with the soldier's uncle threatening: 'Every Syrian in Lebanon is a target'. 

His death would be the fourth publicised beheading at the hands of the Islamic State since it swept regions of Syria and Iraq last month. 

American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were killed in similar circumstances, their murders filmed for propaganda which has circled the globe.  

The strikes come after Islamic State fighters swept into neighbouring Iraq, seizing parts of the country in a declared proto-state straddling of the border.    

There has not been government comment on the airstrikes.

In a separate incident, a Syrian military helicopter is thought to have dropped a barrel bomb on a bus station in a rebel-held neighbourhood of the northern city of Aleppo killing 15 people. 

Residents of Haydariyeh were still pulling bodies from beneath rubble on Saturday evening in the city's latest tragedy following months of unrelenting bloodshed. 

Syrian forces are alleged to have unleashed hundreds of the explosive-filled barrels in Aleppo since anti-government rebels seized the country's second largest city earlier this year.
