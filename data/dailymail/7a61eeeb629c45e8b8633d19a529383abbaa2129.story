Penny farthing postie Graham Eccles has been given an official postmark of approval.

In the same week he moves into his own sorting office Graham Eccles has received a personal identifying code from Ofcom - required by all recognised postal services.

The controversial hike in the price of first class stamps was a penny too far for the 32-year-old poet.

He was so startled by the rise from 46p to 60p that he decided to set up a postal service of his own - using a penny farthing to complete his 20 mile round.

Penny fathering postman: Graham Eccles charges just 25p per to collect and deliver mail in Bude, Cornwall

Customers pay 25p for a stamp before 
posting their letter in one of the mail boxes scattered around the 
town's shops, with Penny Farthing Postal Service promising next day 
delivery. Sometimes mail is even delivered on the same day.

Graham, who has been sorting the letters in his kitchen, said: 'When the price increase was announced I decided to start my own postal service.

'After I discovered that mail posted in Bude was taken 50 miles to Exeter to be sorted before being brought back I became convinced I could do something cheaper and greener.'

Word of Graham's venture has spread around the worldwide, with the father-of-two being made an honorary member of the Letter Writers Alliance of America.

He launched the service on April Fools' Day and sold out of 480 stamps  - which are already being snapped up by collectors on eBay - within two days.

Graham, who also works as a children's entertainer with Ha'penny Entertainments, is now delivering around 100 letters a day, six days a week.
