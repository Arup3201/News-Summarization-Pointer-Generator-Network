David Cameron's battle with Brussels  proves it is impossible to control immigration from the EU, France's far right leader Marine Le Pen has claimed.

The National Front MEP, who is standing for President in 2017, held up Mr Cameron as an 'example' of how European freedom of movement rules were sacrosanct in Brussels.

Ms Le Pen wrote on Twitter: ‘We are not free to decide our immigration policy – as the example of Mr Cameron recently proved.’

National Front leader Marine Le Pen has dismissed David Cameron's efforts to reform migration - claiming it was an example that the EU was impossible to reform

The intervention comes after German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told Mr Cameron that she would rather see Britain leave the EU than rip up freedom of movement rules.

Mrs Merkel warned the Prime Minister that he was reaching a ‘point of no return’ by pushing for reform of the bloc’s sacred free movement system.

The threat has forced Mr Cameron to tone down his ambitions for any deal to curb EU immigration.

Mr Cameron has reportedly ditched a plan to impose a cap on the number of migrants allowed into Britain from the EU.

Ministers will instead focus on making the existing rules work better for Britain.

A source said Mr Cameron’s plans – to be outlined before Christmas – would stretch EU rules ‘to their limits’.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blocked proposals to cap the number of EU migrants allowed into Britian

One proposal would ban EU migrants coming to Britain unless they had a job to go to. Anyone unable to support themselves would be deported after three months.

It is thought the Prime Minister will seek Mrs Merkel’s approval before announcing any changes.

Critics said Mrs Merkel’s warning demonstrated the weakness of Mr Cameron’s position.

Eurosceptic Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It is looking increasingly unlikely that it will be possible to get a successful renegotiation.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The only logical next step is to abandon the renegotiation and announce an immediate referendum.’

It came after a close ally of the PM warned that he may “never be able to control” immigration from within the European Union and voters will have to accept that “a very large” number of foreigners will come to the UK every year.

Nick Boles, a business and education minister, said that freedom of movement is a “fundamental principle” of the EU.

Campaigners fear that a new planned camp in Calais could quickly turn into a 'ghetto' for migrants

Meanwhile, it emerged today that British taxpayers will be contributing to a new £2.35 million a year welcome centre for UK-bound illegal migrants in Calais.

The bill will be added to the £12million the British government has already pledged to the French to improve security in the port town this year.

During a visit to Calais on Monday, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve signed an agreement to ensure the new facility will be open by January.

But aid groups warned the centre could turn into an expensive 'ghetto' that will become a magnet for thousands more asylum seekers who want to make the journey across the English Channel.

Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will have 'a budget of more than three million euros a year, which the state will be asking the European Union for.'

Britain pays more than £8bn a year to the EU, meaning UK money will certainly end up being used to welcome the migrants to Calais, who currently number around 2,500.

Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will be housed in a collection of prefabricated buildings close to the docks, where migrants try to get on lorries every day.

Spain, Romania, Greece and Italy have seen the biggest increases in NINOs in the last six years, according to official government figures

The facility will serve at least 1,500 meals a day, and provide heating toilets and showers as well as beds for the most vulnerable.

Thousands of migrants are camped in Calais waiting for their chance to make it to Britain.

The French port’s mayor told MPs last week that Britain was seen as an ‘El Dorado’ for migrants – and many were prepared to die to make the journey.

Blaming the UK for the crisis, Natacha Bouchart said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the English Channel.

She said illegal migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, were ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado.

Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee, she said: ‘The real magnet is not the city of Calais but the benefits that are perceived in Great Britain.

‘The weekly benefits of £36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives.

‘They have no idea about the value of money … But they know from those people who have got through [to Britain] that … they can easily find work, don’t have to declare their work, they can find accommodation and can get some money every week. People who have got through call and say, “ … this is El Dorado and we’re staying here”.’
