Daniela Henderson, who was imprisoned for 15 months for child cruelty, has been allowed to stay in Britain

A mother who was jailed for locking up her three children without food and water while she went out for the day has avoided deportation because she is not deemed a 'direct threat'.

German Daniela Henderson, who was imprisoned for 15 months for child cruelty, can stay in Britain after a judge ruled that her crime was not serious enough to warrant her deportation under European Union rules.

In May 2010 the 30-year-old, who was in Gateshead, locked her seven, four and two-year-old in a room while she went out for the day, with no food or water, her trial heard.

Neighbours called the police after spotting the youngsters, who were discovered naked apart from the eldest who wore underwear, leaning out of a window.

The Home Office attempted to deport the mother, who no longer has any contact with her children, when she was released from prison in 2011, the Daily Telegraph reported.

But the EU's policy of free movement amongst member countries means that Henderson has to be deemed a 'genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat' to be expelled.

Upper Tribunal Judge Jane Coker rejected the Home Office's argument that the mother would present a risk if she became pregnant or met a partner with children, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The free movement of persons is a fundamental right guaranteed to European Union (EU) citizens by the Treaties.

To deport someone is a very considerable interference in a person's life and must be proportionate to the seriousness of the breach of public policy or public security, the EU guidance states.

The decision to expel someone must be based 'on the personal conduct of the individual concerned which must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society'.

EU citizens and their family members who have the right of permanent residence enjoy increased protection against expulsion as they can be expelled only on serious grounds of public policy or public security.

A Home Office spokesman was unavailable for comment when the MailOnline contacted them.

The decision over Henderson comes after a flurry of changes the Government plans to make in relation to Britain's membership of the EU.

At the start of July it was announced that the Government plans to claw back 100 powers from the EU.

The move represents the start of David Cameron's attempt to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe ahead of the proposed in-out referendum on the EU.

But it is also a coup for Home Secretary Theresa May, who will announce the plans this week and is likely to receive a boost to her profile after successfully deporting hate preacher Abu Qatada.

There are currently 133 EU regulations governing home affairs, justice and the police, including measures to set up a European DNA database and impose driving bans which are valid across the continent.

The process of opting out is governed by the controversial Lisbon Treaty, which states that member nations can exempt themselves from whole areas of EU policy.

The British Government is set to examine each measure in turn to determine whether or not it is in the national interest to sign up.

It is expected that roughly two thirds of the 133 rules will be ditched by ministers next year.

In May the Queen's speech included a crackdown on immigration and an end to the farce of criminals and terrorists abusing human rights laws.

Tthe Government announced plans to stop foreign prisoners using the right to ‘family life’ to avoid deportation.

The legislation will add legal weight to guidance for judges introduced last July by Theresa May that foreign criminals should be able to use Article 8 of the Human Rights Act in exceptional circumstances only.

Judges have continued to ignore the Home Secretary’s guidance because it was not backed up by primary legislation.

 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
