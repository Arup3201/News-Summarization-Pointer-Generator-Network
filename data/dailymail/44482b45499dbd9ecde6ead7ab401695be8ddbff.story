A choirmaster who sexually abused a vulnerable young pupil will be released in less than three years.

Michael Brewer, 68, was yesterday jailed for six years for indecently assaulting Frances Andrade more than three decades ago.

Mrs Andrade, a 48-year-old mother of four, killed herself days after being subjected to a torrid cross-examination during the trial of Brewer and his ex-wife, Kay.

But despite branding Brewer ‘a predatory sex offender’ who subjected Mrs Andrade to ‘depraved’ and sometimes daily abuse when she was 14 and 15, Judge Martin Rudland said he could not impose a longer sentence.

Afterwards Brewer, who worked on the BBC series Last Choir Standing and received the OBE, gave a thin smile to relatives in court.

Mrs Andrade had complained about him smiling as she gave testimony.

Brewer was convicted of five counts of indecent assault, an offence which can today carry up to ten years in jail.

But judges must impose sentences according to the law when the offences took place.

In 1980, the maximum sentence for indecent assault was two years’ imprisonment for each count.

Judge Rudland said he could not take Mrs Andrade’s suicide into account, but did impose consecutive sentences to reflect the overall term a defendant would receive under current guidelines. Brewer will serve half his sentence.

His ex-wife Kay, also 68, was jailed for 21 months for one count of indecent assault.

The judge said she had tried to hide her crimes beneath ‘a cloak of Christian respectability’.

Police are understood to have spoken to ‘dozens’ of former pupils who may also have been abused at world-renowned Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester, where Brewer was director of music.

Sentencing, the judge questioned the eagerness of musical figures to back Brewer at his trial, saying his  behaviour had for too long been accepted by ‘those who should know better’.

Afterwards, Mrs Andrade’s 21-year-old son, Olly, said: ‘We were very happy with the statements made by the judge. He had a good grasp of the situation and made a very fair judgment.’

He added that the sentences had been ‘longer than many were expecting’, especially for Brewer.

After his mother’s death at her home in Guildford, Surrey, on January 24, he had condemned the way she was treated in court, and criticised the lack of support from police.

He was in court yesterday along with his father, Mrs Andrade’s 59-year-old widower Levine.

Brewer’s barrister Kate Blackwell QC said ‘he bears the burden of responsibility in the sense that he failed her while she was in his care’, but said he continued to deny the abuse.

Mrs Andrade, then Frances Shorney, won a scholarship to Chetham’s as a 14-year-old violin prodigy in 1978. 

There, she was groomed by Brewer with compliments and flattery.

Hugs and kisses moved on to sex acts committed in his office at the school or in his camper van.

At 18, Mrs Brewer subjected her to a horrific sexual ordeal at the couple’s home in Manchester, although her then husband was cleared of rape over the same incident.

In 2011, a friend in whom Mrs Andrade had confided passed the abuse allegations on to police, and she reluctantly agreed to testify.

Judge Martin Rudland told Brewer: ‘You were, and you may still be, a predatory sex offender. Of that let  no one be in any doubt.’

He condemned the choirmaster for taking advantage of the young Mrs Andrade’s desire to be ‘cherished by a loving family’ in a ‘manipulative and depraved’ way and ‘treating her as your sexual plaything’.

Brewer, of Birmingham, smiled at his daughters and second wife Sandra as he was led from the dock. Mrs Brewer, of Rossendale, Lancashire, gave no reaction.
