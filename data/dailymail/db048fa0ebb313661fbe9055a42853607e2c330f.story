The best friend of a newlywed who drowned on her honeymoon said the woman's husband used her funeral to show pictures of his late wife standing next to a 'Caution: Drowning' sign.

Gabe Watson, 34, is suspected of killing his wife Tina during a scuba diving trip nine years ago in Australia after he turned off her air supply, the prosecution claimed. He is facing a life sentence without parole.

Amanda Phillips, who was Tina's maid-of-honour at the wedding, told the court in Alabama today that she had initially been convinced that her friend's death, 11 days after she married, was a tragic accident.

Ms Phillips struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke of first hearing of her friend's death. According to ABC, she told the court that she had initially believed Gabe Watson's version of events.

She said: 'He [Gabe Watson] says he made a split decision to leave her. He thought it was better to get help.'

Following the funeral, Ms Phillips said her suspicions were raised by Watson's actions. At his home after the service, he showed pictures of his late wife next to a sign which read 'Caution: Drowning'. Ms Phillips added that she may have seen other photographs of the holiday but that these were what she remembered.

The defence claims Mrs Watson panicked during the dive and knocked off 
her husband's mask and air supply, forcing him to surface for help 
because the current had carried her away from him.

Evidence showed Watson was certified as a rescue diver in 1999, about 
four years before his wife drowned in October 2003.

She was a novice 
diver, the court heard.

The newlyweds were
 in Australia on their honeymoon and were on the first day of a week 
long diving trip off the coast of Queensland when she died.

Watson
 told police 'five to seven minutes' into their dive over the SS Yongala
 shipwreck they struggled against a strong current.

He said Tina Watson got into difficulty and at one point banged his mask and air regulator.

He said he thought he kicked his wife with his fin to get some space from her and she floated away from him.

Last week a doctor told the court he was convinced Watson was trying to save his wife when she became distressed
 underwater.

According to Dr Stanley Stutz, an
 emergency room physician from Chicago, Illinois, Watson had wrapped his arms around his wife Tina moments 
before she sank to the ocean's bottom.

But prosecutors contend Dr Stutz witnessed the woman's murder on the 
Great Barrier Reef.

The words of Ms Phillips came at the beginning of day five of the murder trial. The 
prosecution alleges that Watson plotted his wife's death to collect 
$130,000 in an insurance payout.

Watson served 18 months in prison in Australia after pleading guilty to a
 manslaughter charge in his wife's death. The charge involved 
negligence, not premeditated murder like the Alabama charge.

Watson said he swam down to get his new wife but decided against chasing her to the seabed and instead headed for the surface.

'I remember shouting through my regulator ''Tina, Tina, Tina'',' Watson told police at the time.

The jury of eight women and six men also looked at a haunting underwater photo taken by another diver of the death scene.

It showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the surface. Prosecutors appeared to attempt to cast doubt on Watson's version of what happened.

They believe Watson turned off his wife's air supply while both were underwater and held her in a bear-hug until she lost consciousness - before turning the air back on and letting her sink.
