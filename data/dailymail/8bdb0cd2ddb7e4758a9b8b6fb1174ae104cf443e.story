Super-tall Olympic hopeful Jade Slavin is having the last laugh on school bullies who made cruel jibes about her height.

Classmates would risk a kicking now if they still teased 6ft 2ins Jade over her stature. 

University graduate Jade, 21, has mixed brawn, brains and beauty to become one of Britain's best exponents of the ancient Korean martial art of taekwondo.

Olympic hopeful Jade Slavinwas was bullied at school over her height, but has now become one of Britain's best exponents of the ancient Korean martial art of taekwondo 

She is also a model and aspiring beauty queen after reaching the finals of last year's Miss Earth and recently signing for Manchester agency, Maverick Models. 

However, the Beswick-based fighter will be seeing less of the catwalk and more of the world's taekwondo mats as she chases her Rio 2016 Olympics dream for the next 18 months.

After just four months as a full-time member of the GB Academy on Ten Acres Lane in Manchester, she has been selected for next weekend's prestigious World Taekwondo Grand Prix in the city, featuring 256 of the planet's best in the sport.

Jade said: 'It was hard at school and I used to get bullied a few times for being tall and skinny. 

'That's one of the reasons I got into taekwondo, because my dad thought it would be a good idea to learn how to defend myself.

Standing tall at 6ft 2ins has also helped Jade to be scouted for a local modelling agency

'A friend of my dad's friends did it and one day I bumped in to him and he had his taekwondo suit (dobok) on.

'I was like "dad, what is he doing? Why he is he wearing that suit?" 

'Dad just said he does taekwondo, like the Bruce Lee films. 

'I just wanted to have a go straight away and I loved it.'

Jade, who became national champion in Manchester last month, took up the sport aged nine.

A few years later, she added another string to her bow - modelling. 

Jade has modeled for Atos, the clothing website and other fashion shows 

She said: 'I began modelling when I was 11, sending photos to agencies, but it wasn't until I was about 16 when things started to roll.

'I got asked to do modelling for Atos, the clothing website, and other fashion shows.

'I am signed up to Maverick Models but I want to focus on my taekwondo as the castings are usually during the week when I have training.'

Last year she entered her first beauty pageants, reaching the final of Miss Sunderland and the grand final of Miss Earth.

She said: 'I started modelling to boost my confidence and prove people wrong. Hopefully, I am doing that now.'

Jade is hoping to represent Britain in taekwondo at Rio 2016 

Jade had just completed a three-year sports science degree at Northumbria University when the call came for her to move to Manchester to join the GB Academy.

She said: 'I was excited and surprised when I was told because I thought I was too old - most of the girls are 18 or 19.

'I did have trials when I was 16, but the last stage and boot camp were on at the same time as my exams.

'I did my exams instead and didn't think I would get another chance to prove myself, but I am here now.

'I've finished my studies and while I still have my modelling to fall back on, my main goal is taekwondo and trying to focus on Rio 2016.'
