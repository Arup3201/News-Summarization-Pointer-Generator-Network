It wouldn't usually be the kind of thing Her Majesty would approve of - but when a bonfire designer asked her permission to burn a massive effigy of Buckingham Palace, the Queen gave her seal of approval.

Edward Heath, 63, was inspired for his latest November 5th creation by this summer's Diamond Jubilee celebrations and set about building a 93ft wide, 26ft tall replica of the London landmark from 1,000 wooden pallets over five months.

But cautious of offending the Queen in her special year by burning down her home in a spectacular display of pyrotechnics, he wrote and asked for approval first.

Mr Heath, from Dilhorne, near Stoke-on-Trent, was stunned when a palace secretary replied with her best wishes for his charity fundraising efforts.

'It was absolutely fantastic,' he said. 'She wished me all the best for the future and my adventures raising funds for charity. I read this as a seal of approval.'

The letter said Her Majesty had been 'interested to learn' about his charity bonfire but it was not a 'matter she could give or withhold her permission' to.

He was then given her 'very best wishes' for the future.

Mr Heath, better known as Eddie, said: 'It wasn't anything like 'we think this is a horrible disgrace, you can't do this' - it was very nice.'

The retired scrap metal dealer has been building bonfire effigies based on famous landmarks for 20 years and has raised £80,000 for charities including the Midlands Air Ambulance.

Previous creations have included the Tower of London - where Eddie might once have been taken for such treasonous acts - the White House and Wembley Stadium.

The bonfire night is held for 2,000 people behind the Royal Oak pub in Dilhorne.

Despite seeing five months of effort go up in smoke and flames in less than two hours, Mr Heath says he feels like a 'contented bunny' as he watches it burn.

'I'm an artist and that's my exhibition,' he said.
