She might have blue blood, a nanny and a husband on hand to help out but when it comes to new motherhood Zara Phillips is just like the rest of us.

More than a year after giving birth to her daughter Mia in January 2014 the Queen's granddaughter, who is currently 15th in line to the throne, says she is still battling to regain her pre-baby fitness levels.

In an interview with FT Weekend Magazine the 33-year-old, who is married to former England rugby player Mike Tindall and is one of Britain's leading equestrian riders, revealed: 'What surprised me about having a baby is losing all your fitness and how tough it is to get it back.'

Crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2006 Zara won team silver at the 2012 Olympics in London on her horse High Kingdom.

She also has a host of other awards under her belt including individual and team gold at the European Eventing Championships in 2005 and individual gold and team silver at the World Equestrian Games in 2006.

But, despite an active pregnancy in which she eschewed NHS guidelines and rode with her baby bump, she was forced to take a break from competitive riding and she says she's found it a battle to return to the same level of fitness since becoming a mum.

Zara, who got back on the saddle just 12 weeks after giving birth to Mia, says she now spends her afternoons swimming and cycling to get back in shape.

She said: 'I also try to work out on an exercise bike first thing in the morning.'

But while many new mums take their time to get their pre-pregnancy figures back, time is of the essence for Zara who is hoping to qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

Zara's stables are next to the cottage she shares with Mike and Mia at Gatcombe Park, the Gloucestershire estate that belongs to her mother, Princess Anne, and with 17 months to go until the Olympics she is training hard.

And the royal  said the family-friendly nature of the eventing circuit means she can bring Mia with her to competitions 'so I don't have to go the entire day missing her'.

With the Games looming any plans the couple have to add to their family have been put on the back burner until after next year's event.

Zara says: 'That also means I won't be able to have any more children between now and then too.'

But training doesn't mean Zara has to miss out on family life – she has a live-in horse lorry where baby Mia can sleep at eventing competitions, which she says are great for families.
