Breakthrough: The new test can distinguish between life-threatening tumours and less serious ones, allowing doctors to tailor treatment. File picture

Thousands of women could be spared unnecessary and invasive breast cancer treatment thanks to a test being developed by British scientists.

The test, which could be available on the NHS within five years, can distinguish between life-threatening tumours and less serious ones.

The technique is used for a type of tumour linked to breast cancer that affects 4,800 women a year.

About half of patients with these tumours go on to develop breast cancer, which may later spread to other organs.

But the other half have non-aggressive tumours that aren’t life-threatening.

At present, doctors have no way of distinguishing between the tumours, so all women have surgery and most also have debilitating radiotherapy.

This means about 2,400 a year are having operations needlessly, a fifth of whom will lose their entire breast.

Now researchers at Queen Mary University, London have discovered that women with aggressive tumours also have high levels of a certain molecule in the glands of breast tissue.

They have developed a £200 test in which doctors check the levels of this molecule in a biopsy of the tumour through a microscope.

Those with high levels would be referred on to surgery and possibly radiotherapy, while those with lower levels would be advised to have regular check-ups.

They believe that 2,400 women a year with this type of tumour – called Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) – could be spared treatment.

Professor Louise Jones, from the Bart’s Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University, said: ‘At the moment we treat everybody who has a diagnosis of DCIS in exactly the same way, as though their disease is likely to progress.

‘They will have surgery and they may have chemotherapy and it’s really quite distressing for women.

‘They are told, “You have cancer” – but it’s not quite cancer – and some of them are also told, “You need a mastectomy”.

‘They find this very hard to understand and ultimately this disease may not have done any harm.’

Just under 50,000 women develop breast cancer every year, making it by far the commonest form of the disease. It leads to 11,500 deaths annually

Presently all women with suspected breast cancer have a biopsy, in which a small sample of tumour is removed and sent away for further examinations.

These let doctors know which type of cancer a woman has, and this determines her course of treatment.

This new test would just be carried out at the same time as the existing ones, which is why it would be so cheap.By comparison, surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer costs between £3,500 and £6,600.

Breast cancer surgery is particularly upsetting for women – especially a mastectomy – as they can feel as if they are losing their femininity.

Around 70 per cent will have radiotherapy afterwards, which involves daily trips to the hospital for up to eight weeks and can lead to sickness, fatigue and pain.

Just under 50,000 women develop breast cancer every year, making it by far the commonest form of the disease. It leads to 11,500 deaths annually.

Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the Breast Cancer Campaign, which funded the research, said it could be 'life-changing'

The researchers will now carry out thorough checks of the test on at least 600 women to ensure it properly distinguishes between the two types of tumours.

If these go to plan, they hope the test will be available on the NHS in about five years.

Early trials of the test on 700 women have shown that, for those with DCIS, it accurately diagnoses whether they have non-aggressive or aggressive breast cancer.

Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the Breast Cancer Campaign, which funded the research, said: ‘This research could be key to the hunt to develop a life-changing reliable prognostic test for women with DCIS.

‘Such a test would mean women with DCIS would finally be able to make informed decisions about their treatment.

‘They would no longer face the agonising choice between risking their breast cancer becoming invasive or facing treatment without knowing whether their DCIS will become life-threatening or not.

‘A test won’t be available in the clinic overnight, but we’re hopeful that ongoing research will allow this to happen in the future, which will signal a pivotal moment in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.’

Dr Gillian Farnie, of the Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, said: ‘The exciting research makes significant steps forward in our understanding of the biology of DCIS and its progression to invasive cancer.

‘These results, if validated by other research groups, could provide a new marker for identifying DCIS that are more likely to progress to invasive disease, however more importantly may highlight a group of patients where no treatment is necessary.

‘This would be a major breakthrough in the management of DCIS and although this research is not ready for clinical application yet it shows great promise for the future.’

But Professor Peter Barrett-Lee, of the Velindre Cancer Centre in Cardiff, said: ‘This is an interesting new scientific finding and could prove important in the future, but at the moment the results of the study need to be replicated by others, and so any potential prognostic uses and treatment related to this may be many years away.’
