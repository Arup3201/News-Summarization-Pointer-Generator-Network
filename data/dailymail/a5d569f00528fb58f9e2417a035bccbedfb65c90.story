Supermarket chain Morrisons was today declared the cheapest place on the high street to buy your Christmas dinner.

The store beat close rival Lidl with its £2.88 per-head cost - managing to shave 23p a head off Lidl's per head cost of £3.11.

The budget price for the festive feast brings the total for a Christmas lunch for eight to an undeniably manageable £23.07 - and that's with a mince pie left over for Boxing Day.

Bargain festive feast: Morrisons' Christmas dinner basket comes in at £23.07 for a family of eight

Super savers: The store's festive feast

The store unveiled the details of its cut-price Christmas feast this morning, as research from personal finance website Lovemoney.com revealed the per-head costs of Morrisons' competitors after creating comparable Christmas lunch shopping baskets across eight major supermarkets.

Each basket contained the same 11 main ingredients widely considered to be 'essential' to a Christmas lunch.

STORE          TOTAL   PER HEAD

Morrisons     £23.07         £2.88

Lidl                 £24.89         £3.11

Asda          £25.78         £3.22

Tesco         £27.44         £3.43

The Co-op    £29.71          £3.71

Aldi                £30.74         £3.84

Sainsbury’s  £31.36          £3.92 

Ocado          £45.36           £5.67

Waitrose       £60.58          £7.57

While such luxuries as chipolatas, cauliflower cheese, bread sauce and Yorkshire puddings are not allowed for, the baskets do include cranberry sauce, sage and onion stuffing, and a selection of puddings including Christmas cake, Christmas pud and mince pies as well as brandy butter.

Morrisons
 takes the crown for the second year running, with its festive food 
basket of eleven different Christmas essentials coming to a total of 
just £23.07.

The basket, which is the same across all 
the stores, includes items such as a turkey, Brussels sprouts and 
potatoes along with mince pies, two Christmas puddings and brandy butter.

The basket from Morrisons comes in at £37.51 less than a similar basket from the most expensive shop on the list, Waitrose.

Lidl narrowly misses the top spot with a price tag of £24.89, or £3.11 per head, while Asda is in third place with a lunch of £25.78 or £3.22 per person.

Aldi took second place last year but has slipped to sixth this year, behind Tesco and the Co-operative, which have total bills of £30.74 or £3.84 each.

Winning the cut-price war: Morrisons is offering the cheapest festive basket for the second year in a row

Aldi's elevated basket prices comes 
largely because they have upped the quality of the items they are 
selling in their standard basket, a spokesman for Lovemoney.com said 
today.

'The potatoes 
from Aldi, for example, are "specially selected for goose fat roasting" 
while the parsnips are "honey glazed’"compared to the bog standard of 
both which most other supermarkets are selling in their most basic 
range.'

The consumer expert at Lovemoney says that while the vegetables are roughly similar for most shops it is the larger items, such as the turkey or the Christmas cake, which make the most difference to the cost of the basket.

'At Waitrose, for example, where the bill comes to £60.58 or £7.57 per head, the cost of the turkey is significantly more.

'This is because it’s priced by weight and it is free range. Ocado is also the only other supermarket which has a fresh turkey included.'

NB: The shopping bills for each supermarket are not identical as the weights and varieties are not always the same. If an exact product comparison wasn’t available, Lovemoney.com used the closest match.

Iced top fruit cake, 900g, £3.50

Brandy butter with Courvoisier, 200g    £1.85

Mince pies 9 pack,  £1

TOTAL    £23.07
