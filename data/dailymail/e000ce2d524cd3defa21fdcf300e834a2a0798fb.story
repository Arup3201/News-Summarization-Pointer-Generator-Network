New Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic has hailed Lionel Messi as miraculous while revealing his admiration for the Argentina captain.

Rakitic, who joined from Seville for a reported £14million earlier this summer, is one of a host of big-name signings to arrive at the Nou Campin this transfer window.

And the Croatian midfielder has made clear who has made the biggest impression on him since joining the club, despite only training with Messi on a handful of occasions since.

New chapter: Rakitic will be hoping to continue the excellent form he showed for Seville at new side Barcelona

In awe: Rakitic has admitted he has a lot of admiration for his team-mate and world superstar Lionel Messi

He told 24sata: 'I trained a few times with Leo because he joined the team later due to the World Cup.

'Sometimes in training I stop and watch him, he is miraculous. I admire him and I learn from him.

'He impresses me with everything he does. He behaves normally, as if he isn't such a big star.'

Elsewhere, Rakitic has revealed that he remains in constant conversation with new Barcelona boss Luis Enrique ahead of the new season, although no set position has been assigned to him as such yet.

Hard work: Rakitic is determined to fill the void left by Cesc Fabregas' departure to Chelsea this summer

He added: 'I haven't spoken specifically about positions with Luis Enrique because we are still in training.

'It will take time. He talks to me very often, to him the details are very important, he cares a lot about the little things.

'He told me that he realised that I was great when I was playing against his former club Celta.'
