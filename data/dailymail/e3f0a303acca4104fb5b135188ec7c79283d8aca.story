Bath are set to announce the signing of Wales fly-half Rhys Priestland. Scarlets playmaker Priestland will move to Bath after the World Cup later this year.

It is thought he has agreed a two-year deal, with an an announcement planned on his move from west Wales in the next few days.

Priestland, 27, has won 32 Wales caps, but is currently behind Ospreys star Dan Biggar in the fly-half pecking order.

He would become Aviva Premiership title contenders Bath's second major signing for next term, joining Fiji scrum-half Niko Matawalu, while it is thought that South Africa Test number eight Duane Vermeulen remains a key recruitment target.

Priestland joined the Scarlets in 2005, graduating to the first team via their academy system.

He would provide important back-up for England's current fly-half George Ford at the Recreation Ground.

Priestland is an experienced international, representing Wales on 32 occasions, but is no longer first choice

Priestland is not among the current group of Wales internationals to be offered national dual contracts - deals funded by the Welsh Rugby Union and Wales' four professional regions from a £3.3million pot.

Six players have so far signed up - Sam Warburton, Dan Lydiate, Jake Ball, Rhodri Jones, Hallam Amos and Tyler Morgan - with more set to follow this month.

With Dan Biggar currently ahead of Priestland in the pecking order, he has not been offered a dual contract
