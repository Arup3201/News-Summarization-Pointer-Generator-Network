These twin babies have been handed a big break in TV at just eight months with starring roles in hit crime drama Broadchurch.

Sisters Ava and Millie Priddis were selected from scores of applications to showcase their talents alongside stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman.

The babies, from Exeter, Devon, will be part of the main family in the BAFTA award-winning show that starts its second series today.

Proud father Luke Priddis, 21, who lives with partner Rosie, also 21, admits he was not initially a big fan of the show - but is now.

He said: 'I cannot say a lot because it is all very secret but the girls play a part in the main family.

'The girls take it in turns to play the baby and there is also a real life-like doll. 

'Rosie and I were always there when they were involved in filming.

'It was all very full on. We met David Tennant and Olivia Colman as well as others involved and we were picked up by a special car and taken about and brought home.'

He added: 'It was quite an experience. Rosie was always very keen on it but I have to say I never watched it, but I will be this time round that's for sure.'

Mr Priddis, a health care apprentice at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital, said it was his mother who helped the twins land the role.

He added: 'She saw an advert looking for twin babies and sent off a picture of Ava and Millie.

'Apparently there were loads of applications but within half an hour of receiving the photo we received a call asking us to come along.' 

'It was all very full on. We met David Tennant and Olivia Colman as well as others involved,' said father Luke
