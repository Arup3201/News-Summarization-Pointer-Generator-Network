These pictures show the latest abuse suffered by a group of helpless seals on a San Diego beach.

They show three men approaching and harassing the mammals as they try to rest at the 'Children's Pool' in La Jolla - in two separate incidents.

This comes after the city's mayor made the beach off-limits at night following an earlier attack on the seals by two young women who were seen kicking and punching them. The incidents, captured on a webcam, suggest the creatures suffer regular abuse from humans.

Incident: A man harasses a seal resting at the Children's Pool in La Jolla, California. The incident, captured on webcam, follows an earlier attack on the mammals by two women

Video:  Two men are seen harassing seals in a separate incident captured on film. The beach is closed to the public at night

The attacks have been captured on round-the-clock 'Seal Cam' was set up at the Children's Pool in La Jolla to capture the dozens of seals on film. 

But
 rather than just attracting nature enthusiasts it also attracted the 
police after the vicious attack on the mammals by two young women 
was caught on film.

The women were filmed sitting on the 
seals, pulling their flippers and kicking them during the incident on 
January 24 before the animals rush into the water to escape the abuse. 
One of the pair takes photographs as the other continues to hurt the animals.

Activists say rather than a rare 
event - the abuse of seals is commonplace.

Though no similar evidence 
exists of violence, videos captured by the Save La Jolla Seals group 
show families closely approaching and scaring the animals, children kicking sand at the creatures and divers them and causing visible distress.

Shocking: The footage of the two abusers horrified the La Jolla community and has caused a night time ban on people accessing the Children's Pool area

Many La Jolla locals are unhappy about restricted access to certain parts of the beach by Mayor Bob Filner

Abuse of the seals appears to have become a common feature at the beach.

Seal Cam observer Sarah Wan 
wrote: 'We had our first pup born today and it was something special.  
This evening mother took it for a short swim. 
 Earlier today the pup tried to figure out what a sea gull was. 
Unfortunately, this afternoon someone threw sand into the pups eyes.  
Really terrible.'

Nasty verbal altercations have taken 
place near the spot between the seal activists who want people barred from 
going on the beach and those that support mixed use.

Mayor Bob
 Filner introduced new rules banning people from going onto the beach between 
sunset and sunrise until the end of the pupping season in May.

'I felt it was important to take this step after evidence of individuals
 seen on video tape, harassing, taunting and causing stress to the seals
 at the Children’s Pool in La Jolla,' he said in a statement.

'The behavior was shocking, 
reprehensible and certainly not a reflection of how most citizens in our
 fine city believe animals should be treated.'

A rope is currently up at the beach to stop visitors getting too 
close during the birthing season and a park ranger and police patrols 
have also been introduced to ensure visitors respect the animals. 

However, many closely approach the creatures regardless to get holiday snaps and
 many divers swim onto the beach alarming seals and causing them to rush
 into the water.

Pupping season: A Harbor Whale mother is seen attending to her new born at the Children's Pool, La Jolla. Various cases of disruption of the animals have been reported

Resting: Harbor seals are supposed to be protected on the beach, but many people ignore the rope and signs

Disruptive: There is an ongoing debate in the local area over whether the beach can be used by both humans and seals

The two rival camps have long been at war over the beach with many 
saying activists put off visitors who just want to respectfully observe 
the animals at a beach originally designated for children's use.

However, the shocking abuse in January appears to have bolstered support for measures to further support the 
animals.

Larry Wan of the Western Alliance for Nature which oversees the web-cam told MailOnline: 'I think the beach closure is absolutely necessary and a step in the right direction.

'We are very thankful to Mayor Filner who appreciates the seals and wants to provide meaningful protection for them.  Unfortunately, the incident seen of the two women harassing the seals is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the harassment of seals on this beach.'

Bryan Pease, a 
lawyer who represents the Animal Protection and Rescue League, told KPBS
 San Diego:  'It's great that the new mayor is being proactive and at 
least 
closing the seal rookery at night, when the seals are without any 
protection, and the rope is not really visible.'

'This is important for public safety and for protection of the resting marine mammals during their pupping season.'

There have been no arrests following the case in January.

Marine mammals, including seals, 
whales, dolphins, sea otters and other animals, are all protected under 
the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), which makes it illegal to 
harass, feed, hunt, capture, collect or kill any marine mammal or part 
of a marine mammal, according to the Marine Mammal Center.

According
 to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, harbor seals 
live in temperate coastal areas, including both the west and east coasts
 of the United States. The mammals ‘haul out’ of the water to rest, 
regulate their temperatures, interact with each other and to give birth.

Mayor Filner used an emergency order to enforce the night time closure which was put in place from Tuesday.
