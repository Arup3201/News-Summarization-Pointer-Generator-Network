The cost of staying in a top London hotel for just one night has reached an all-time high, according to a new accommodation survey.

One night in a 5-star hotel room in London now averages at £497, compared to £361 in Geneva, £283 in LA, £259 in Tokyo and £131 in New York.

As a result of land prices, the strength of the pound and a lack of supply of luxury hotels in the capital, property prices in central London have risen by 77 per cent since 2009 - pushing budget hoteliers out of the West End.

Some of the most luxurious rooms in London's ultra slick Mayfair now cost up to £11,700 per night, and London’s five-star hotels are now amongst the most expensive in the world, ahead of Dubai, Paris, Moscow and Rome.

Opulence: A suite at London's InterContinental Hotel on Park Lane can cost over £11,700 per night

The average price for staying in a five-star London hotel suite is £2,050 - compared to £248 for renting an apartment.

And at £746,044 - the cost of renting a 
hotel suite for a year in the city is around the same as buying a 
flat in London or a country house in the home counties, according to the research, conducted by Wetherell property agents.

Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'The report shows the astonishing 
strength of the recovery in values in the luxury hotel, serviced 
apartment and private rented markets in prime central London since the 
global recession of 2007 to 2009.

'Since
 2009 hotel and rented apartment rates have risen by over 25 per cent 
and the cost of renting a room and sleeping in London is now at a record
 high.'

Pricey: A string of luxury hotels, including the Chiltern Firehouse Hotel in Marylebone, have opened in the capital

The report, carried out by Dataloft, revealed that
 Mayfair has the most expensive hotel suite in the capital – over 
£11,700 per night for a stay in the Royal Suite in Park Lane’s 
InterContinental Hotel.

The area also contains the largest number of the
 top 10 most expensive hotel suites across the capital. 

With increasing numbers of international visitors, a string of luxury hotels have started to appear in London, including the Edition by Marriott, the Chiltern Firehouse 
Hotel by Andre Balasz and the Beaumont Hotel (set to open this Autumn).
