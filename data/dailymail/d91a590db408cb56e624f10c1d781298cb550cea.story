A plane passenger's family have sued American Airlines after he died following an in-flight meal.

Othon Cortes died after eating a contaminated chicken meal during an American Airlines flight from Barcelona to New York, according to his relatives.

The lawsuit is the latest unwelcome news to hit the stricken airline, which announced earlier this week it had filed for bankruptcy.

The widow and daughter of Mr Cortes, 73, have filed a lawsuit against the carrier following his death shortly after the May 18 flight.

In their complaint, his widow Raquel and daughter Sandra allege Mr Cortes was served food contaminated with the deadly bacteria, Clostridium perfingens.

After landing in New York, they claim Cortes felt sharp stomach cramps and sudden thirst along with a 'clear outward manifestation of severe physical illness'.

His condition deteriorated as Cortes, who was travelling with his wife, boarded the next leg of their trip from New York to Miami.

It is claimed Cortes suffered nausea, shortness of breath and a 'cardiac event' on the Miami-bound flight.

Despite making an emergency landing in Norfolk, VA, tragedy struck and Cortes was pronounced dead shortly after.

His family say American Airlines and its catering company Sky Chefs failed to properly maintain or prepare his meal.

They add that the airline shouldn't have allowed Cortes access to the Miami flight without first finding him medical attention.

The Cortes family are now seeking over $1million in damages, but Sky Chefs say they did not cater that flight and are opposing the legal action.

American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy two days ago in a desperate push to offload huge debts following years of rising fuel prices and labour costs.

The reorganisation of American Airlines and its parent company AMR Corp could lead to a shakeup in prices, fewer flights and an altered flying experience, it was warned.

The airline insisted it would honour existing bookings and airmiles for passengers, but experts fear the company's bankruptcy may affect future plans.
