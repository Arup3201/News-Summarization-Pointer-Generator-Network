Sami Khedira 'would not help any team' according to Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer, because injuries have ruined his physical attributes.

Khedira's contract at Real Madrid expires this summer, and the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool have been linked with the World Cup winner.

But Beckenbauer was scathing about the German's value, after a season in which he has been dogged by injuries and started just four league games for Real Madrid.

'In his current physical shape Khedira would not help any team forward,' Beckenbauer told Sky.

'He is missing something in each aspect of the game at the moment.

'His ability to keep on running in midfield was key to his game. He does not add much without that...'
