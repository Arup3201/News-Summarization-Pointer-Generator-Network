China has sent two fighter jets to investigate US and Japanese military planes’ entry into a disputed area of the East China Sea.

Tensions in the volatile region have mounted since the Chinese Air Force stated that it ‘escorted’ foreign warplanes out of its newly-declared air defence identification zone (ADIZ).

The zone covers islands which are the subject of a bitter territorial dispute with Japan – sparking fears that it could lead to an unplanned military incident.

Two Japanese F-15 fighter jets: China scrambled jets today in response to U.S. spy planes and Japanese aircraft - including F-15 fighters - entering its new air defence zone over the East China Sea

Last week Beijing declared that all 
aircraft crossing through airspace must file flight plans and identify 
themselves or face unspecified ‘defensive emergency measures’. But the 
US, Japan and South Korea have all defied the ruling over the past few 
days.

In an intensification 
of the spat, China yesterday launched fighter jets into the area at the 
same time as foreign military flights.

Chinese
 Air Force spokesman Colonel Shen Jinke said warplanes had been 
scrambled to monitor two US surveillance aircraft and ten Japanese 
planes, including an F-15 fighter jet, crossing through the ADIZ.

He was reported by state media as saying that the jets had tracked and identified the planes.

Ministers
 in Tokyo declined to give details of the flights but said the Japanese 
Air Force was on routine operations and had encountered no ‘abnormal’ 
incidents. China announced the creation of the zone last Saturday.

It covers a vast area of the East China Sea, including a region where gas has been discovered.

The row centres on airspace over three uninhabited outcrops called the Senkaku Islands by Japan and Diaoyu by China.

Taiwan
 also has a claim to the islands – bought by Japan from private sellers 
in 2012, much to the anger of China – and South Korea maintains an 
interest in a submerged rock in the zone known as Ieodo. The US called 
the establishment of the ADIZ a ‘destabilising attempt to alter the 
status quo in the region’.

Baroness Ashton, the EU foreign policy envoy, expressed concern about the diplomatic flare-up.

She
 said: ‘This development heightens the risk of escalation and 
contributes to raising tensions in the region. The EU calls on all sides
 to exercise caution and restraint.’

But her intervention was mocked by China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang.

‘Madam
 Ashton should know that some European countries also have air defence 
identification zones,’ said Qin. ‘I don’t know if this leads to tensions
 in the European regional situation. European countries can have air 
defence identification zones. Why can’t China?’

International
 analysts claim Beijing is engaged in a long-term strategy to boost its 
claims to the disputed islands, rather than displaying a military show 
of force.

June Teufel 
Dreyer, a security specialist at the University of Miami, said the 
policy was aimed at placating the domestic audience.

She said: ‘They will be seen to “escort” the intruding planes, but they are not going to shoot them.’
