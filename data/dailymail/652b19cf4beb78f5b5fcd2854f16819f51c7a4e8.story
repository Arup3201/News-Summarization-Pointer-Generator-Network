Time travel may still remain a sci-fi mystery, but one artist has skilfully turned a sparse modern-day room into a 19th century photograph - and captured the process on a time-lapse film.

Maisie Broadhead, 32, has become known for her photographic parodies where she creates modern interpretations of historical photos.

In her latest work for an exhibition at the National Gallery in London, Broadhead has transformed a young model into Lady Elizabeth Eastlake by Scottish photographers Hill & Adamson.

To create a time-lapse video capturing the  2012 to 1844 
transformation, the London-born artist worked with 
filmmaker Jack Cole.

Set in an empty room with exposed brick, the three-minute clip shows the model
drinking from a coffee cup, eating a banana and chatting as she is
dressed in period clothing and slowly travels back to the 19th century.

The set is a hive of activity as every detail is crucial to the success of the transformation.

After some posing and a change of lighting, the model is then placed behind a false wall, complete with wallpaper and framed to actually become the photograph.

The video will play in the same room as the original photograph at the exhibition which opens October 2012.

Broadhead graduated from the Royal 
College of Art in 2009 with an MA in Gold, Silver, Metalwork and 
Jewellery, having first completed a BA in 3D Design at Brighton 
University.

On her university webpage she wrote: 
'Recently my work has explored and questioned how objects become valued;
be this through changing the context or material of a ‘normal’ domestic
object, creating ‘fake’ photographic re-enactments of historic 
paintings, or creating illusory jewellery where the material worth is 
only seen from one photographic perspective.

'Humour
within my work is important, so through my exploration of subject 
matter I’m also aiming to create work that makes us smile.

'Ultimately I’m striving to create work that is a balance of elegance and intelligence.'

Her first UK solo show took place at Sarah Myerscough Gallery in November 2010.

She has previously collaborated with 
her mother Caroline on a project called Taking the Chair, in which the 
pair selected seven paintings by masters such as Vermeer, Velasquez and 
Magritte, in which a chair has a powerful presence.

The final result is a staggeringly realistic interpretation of the original photo
