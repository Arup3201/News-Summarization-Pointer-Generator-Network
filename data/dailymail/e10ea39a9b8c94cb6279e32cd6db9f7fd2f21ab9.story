Benefits Street star Deirdre Kelly today revealed she could switch to supporting UKIP in the wake of two shock defections by Tory MPs.

Speaking at an event at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, Miss Kelly, who found fame as White Dee on the controversial show, hit out at the way the government had sought to impose sanctions on benefit claims.

She condemned Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith for being 'out of touch with the real world' and demanded greater job variety 'because not everybody wants to work in an office or build a wall'.

Benefits Street star Deirdre Kelly used an event at the Tory party conference to attack government policy, and int she is planning to switch to UKIP

Miss Kelly was invited to address a fringe meeting hosted by the Policy Exchange think tank entitled: 'What more needs to be done to help people into work?'

She said: 'I like to speak for myself but Mr Farage doesn't seem to be doing a bad job. He has had a few extra members joining recently, hasn't he?' 

At the weekend Tory MP Mark Reckless announced he was defecting to UKIP, following Douglas Carswell who jumped ship in August. 

Miss Kelly said she 'very well could' vote Ukip at the election, and told the audience she was 'not a massive fan' of Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Asked about benefit cuts, Ms Kelly criticised Mr Duncan Smith, who has overseen the Government's welfare reforms.

'You have someone who I think is completely out of touch with the real world making decisions on people who do actually live in the real world ... that's Iain Duncan Smith, isn't it?'

Ms Kelly told the audience that job centres 'have to get more in touch with the real person'.

'I have experienced some not very nice job centres,' she said. 'You do just go in, you sit down, you are looked down upon.

'They just need to understand that, just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person. Just because you are on benefits doesn't mean that you are not physically looking for a job.'

Asked about the welfare changes introduced since 2010, she said: 'I have noticed a change. I think it's considerably got worse.'

Benefits Street star Deirdre Kelly told Tory activists that Iain Duncan Smith is out of touch and jobcentres offer the wrong sorts of jobs

She addressed the packed Policy Exchange event on: 'What more needs to be done to help people into work?'

She criticised the way sanctions were applied to people for failing to fulfil their obligations under the system.

'I think people are too quick to sanction people who are looking for jobs. You do have to deal with it on an individual basis,' she said.

'There are people out there who are very happy to sit at home and receive their benefits and not physically look for a job. But I know people who apply for 20, 30 jobs a week.

'You can't force an employer to give you a job, so what you have to do is make sure the resources are there to enable the jobseeker to get a job, be a bit more realistic with what kind of schemes are available to them, because not everybody wants to work in an office or build a wall.'

She added: 'It's not fair that someone works a 40-hour, if not more, week and doesn't have as much to live on as someone who sits at home, doesn't work and is given money from the Government.

'But that's not that individual's fault, that is the Government's fault. I think the Government also has to look at (the) minimum wage and things like that.

'It's the Government that says how much someone is entitled to to live on, not the individual.'

Miss Kelly said jobcentres have to be realistic about the roles they offer, because 'not everybody wants to work in an office or build a wall'

Douglas Carswell became the first Conservative to defect to UKIP last month, sparking speculation that up to eight MPs were considering leaving the party

Ms Kelly has hinted in the past that she would consider running for Parliament, and told the gathering in Birmingham: 'It's something I would think about, but obviously I wouldn't object to starting at the bottom - I wouldn't want to go straight in and have David Cameron's job.

'I would think about it because I am interested in politics and I am interested in normal people and I am interested in the country.'

She said she would form her own party if she decided to stand and dismissed criticism of her background, saying: 'Just because you are a little bit common doesn't mean that you are stupid and you wouldn't be able to have a good input. I think the more common you are the more in touch you are with real people, so yes it would be something I would consider.'

She added: 'You can never be liked by 100 per cent of people, I think most MPs know that.'
