It's not every day you reach a milestone birthday, so when you do - you should celebrate in style.

And Zaire, London Zoo's giant gorilla, marked her 40th in style by wolfing down a cake made specially for her by the Great British Bake Off runner-up Richard Burr. 

The fan favourite on this year's show, Richard faced the tough challenge of creating a dessert with all of Zaire's favourite treats, including sugar-free jelly, apples, carrots and walnuts.

And he certainly lived up to his 'star baker' reputation because the 16.5st western lowland gorilla greedily devoured it all.

But Richard, who earned the coveted 'star baker' title five times on the show, wasn't fazed by the task - which required the cake to be vegan and Zaire's favourite colour pink. 

He said: 'I'm thrilled to have made a birthday gift for such a special lady. 

'I've always loved London Zoo and am a regular visitor so it's a pleasure to use my Bake Off skills and help celebrate Zaire's birthday. 

'I hope she likes the treat I've created especially for her.' 

He added: 'Frankly, if she was on the panel, I might have won the show, to be honest.' 

The cake had several defined layers, which featured walnuts, apples, carrots, red peppers and sugar-free jelly

The red peppers were the first to go, said zoo staff, before Zaire dug into the pink-coloured jelly

Zaire's favourite colour is pink so the colour had be prominent in Richard's cake for the birthday girl.

But he also had the tricky task of making a vegan cake without eggs, sugar, butter or flour to fit Zaire's dietary requirements.

He aimed to give Zaire her daily diet in cake form and include her favourite treats: carrots, apples and walnuts. 

Keen to show off his Bake Off skills, Richard made sure the cake had 'clear, defined layers' - a popular requirement of judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood.

There is a layer of shredded carrot and parsnip, bound with coconut oil and with brazil nuts hidden inside.

Instead of buttercream, icing is ground cashews coloured with beetroot juice and decorated with pecans.

There are slices of red pepper in the middle and the top layer is sugar-free vegan jelly with strawberries set within.

Zaire was presented with the cake at her birthday party and immediately ran over to indulge in some cake. 

She carefully picked at her favourite bits, with red peppers being among the first to go, before she dug into the jelly topping. 

Zaire, who likes to forage for food and interact with children who visit her, is the eldest gorilla at ZSL London Zoo and has been there for 30 years.

Gorilla keeper Glynn Hennessy said: 'Zaire is our old lady of the group, but is still a girlie girl at heart and loves anything pink, as keepers have noticed from various enrichment activities.

'She loves pink fruit tea like strawberry or blackcurrant, so Richard making her a pink birthday treat was a fantastic surprise. She definitely enjoyed tasting all her favourite ingredients.

'Zaire has been at ZSL London Zoo for 30 years and is a calming influence on the rest of the group. She's been there and seen it all so she deserves a fabulous fortieth. 

'We're sure having Richard on-hand made her birthday a memorable day.'

Tucked away in a corner with her treat, she clearly has no plans to share with her friends

'She definitely enjoyed tasting all her favourite ingredients,' said gorilla keeper Glynn Hennessy
