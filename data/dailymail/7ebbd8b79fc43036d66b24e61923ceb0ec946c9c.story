An Arizona retiree expecting a shipment of photos from her dying father was floored by what she ended up receiving instead: 1,000 love letters he’d sent her mother after World War II forced them apart.

Jane Bartow says the lovesick and strikingly intelligent dispatches from the warfront were likely included by her fiercely private father, Darrow Beaton, accidentally. But the error revealed an unbelievably complete account of what war was like for the young Merchant Marine and his wife Elinor.

‘In one of his letters he said he remembered kissing her in the snow that first night they met,’ said Bartow, whose book details the initially desperate but ultimately triumphant tale of her parents’ early years as a couple fighting to stay together during WWII.

Love during wartime: Jane Bartow got a surprise lesson in history and in her own parents' emotional courtship when her father, as he was dying from cancer, accidentally sent her a box of the private letters he'd sent her mother as a Merchant Marine at sea during WWII

‘My dad was a little bit wild and my mother was attracted to that as a bishop's daughter,’ Bartow told MailOnline. ‘He was from the other side of the tracks.’

Her father was even the leader of a gang, Bartow said, and her mother's father was a national church leader, so the stakes were high. Both for Elinor and Darrow.

While Darrow may have been the frontrunner in the quest for Elinor’s affections, she had many other men vying for her. One thing that shocked Bartow while reading her father’s letters was learning that her mother had received marriage proposals from many men during the war.

‘She had so many other boyfriends,’ said Bartow. ‘She was very beautiful and very talented.’

'He remembered kissing her in the snow that first night they met': Bartow immersed herself in the 1,000 pages of letters, which showed her a side of her parents she otherwise never would have known

While he was dying of cancer in 2008, Darrow Beaton accidentally sent his daughter 1,000 pages of love letters he'd sent his wife while he was at sea during the war from December 1941 to November 1945. Jane Beaton Bartow was so moved by the riveting, emotional courtship the letters revealed that she used them to write a book To Elinor: A Romance in Two Voices. She also has started a project dedicated to preserving the stories of WWII veterans called World War II Daughters. Bartow provided the excerpts below, taken from her father's many letters:

May 1, 1943You write that you wonder if the world will ever be the same again. Of course, the world is going to settle down again. We’ll all live those very normal lives—the sort of lives that we used to hate at times because they seemed to be so dull and uninteresting. I must keep believing that. We all must, or there is no use fighting.May 14, 1943You’re now reading a letter from the happiest fellow in the world! I’ve got a brand new queen of the seas for my ship. Honey, she’s a huge Liberty cargo ship. I’m so excited that I’m jumpy.May 1943It’s getting late. There are many things on my mind tonight. I want to lie here for a long while and figure things out. There’s this business of secret codes, quite a load on my mind. But by tomorrow I’ll have this ol’ Irish mind cleared up, things in their right notch.February 11, 1944Mid-PacificThings have eased up with us, and I can now sit here and listen to a broadcast station again after dark. As I sit here, something somehow demands of me to remember how darn lucky I have been so far in life. Things could be so different with me, couldn’t they? But here I am. Alive. Feeling great, working at a good job, feeling as if I have a bit part in the war, and looking forward to a leave at home. There are luckier guys, I guess, but they can’t feel any happier than I do tonight.February 25, 1944Sitting here with the static beating a regular tattoo on my ears, I suddenly got the brilliant idea to read over some of your letters again. Maybe it’s just that I happened to get the wrong letters, but in the three I picked up, Im branded for life—a cynic, unfaithful dog, drunkard, etc.May 13, 1944I suppose that everyone at home is watching for the news of the invasion. I know that we all are hoping that they put it off for a while so we can get at least close to it when it starts. It’s going to be something huge, and I can’t help but think that peace will come shortly after it starts. Let’s just hope that things go perfectly for the boys when they hit the beach over there.It is dark. I have a small desk lamp on, and the radio is playing static to me. The ship is asleep and quiet except for the throbbing of the thousands of horsepower pushing us along. There’s a cigarette burning in the ash tray sending smoke up to be scattered by the fan which is spinning this hot, moist night. The ports are down, the huge steel doors are closed about me. I’m quite alone with all of these dials, meters, trimmers, and gadgets. Alone with my thoughts and my work. And my thoughts, quite naturally are about you.

Happy mistake? As Darrow Beaton was dying from lung cancer in 2008, the World War II veteran mailed his eldest daughter four bankers' boxes, each one overflowing with a lifetime of family photos. But in one box was something even more precious

She’d even accepted two rings. But Bartow said that’s just what women did in order to preserve soldier morale.

'She was being a good girl and listening to Emily Post,’ Bartow said, referring to the famous etiquette writer of the day, who encouraged women to ‘Just say yes.’

So what made her mother say yes to at least two other men but ultimately marry her father? It wasn’t just his bad boy behavior, Bartow said.

‘If you have the opportunity to read all the letters, you see he’s so intelligent,’ Bartow said. ‘I think that attracted her.’

HIYA SWEETS: The letters were typed on a mill, which was often used by seamen in order to translate Morse code

Beautiful and talented: While her father was smitten by her mother, Bartow says that her mother often dreamed of bigger things outside marriage and family and nearly walked away from the relationship

Code: The couple used a code when describing geography, presumably as a way to reveal information soldiers were supposed to keep secret

The couple met just after Pearl Harbor, Bartow told KVOA, and the letters spanned from December 1941 to November 1945.

In between, there were hardships. Darrow was at sea for long stretches and there was even a time when Elinor nearly chose another man.

‘He almost lost my mother,’ Bartow said.

But on his final leave in 1945, after Elinor lied to her parents in order to go see Darrow, something changed.

‘She was just swept off her feet on 
that last leave he had,’ she said. ‘She gave up her dreams of being 
something big like a movie star.’

At
midnight on July 14, 1944, Elinor and Darrow Beaton were married in 
Seattle. Two hours later, Darrow was shipped out to sea for the final 
time.

Thankfully, the 
couple would have a joyous reunion in due time and go on to raise a 
family together. One that included a daughter who, until both were dead 
and gone, had no idea how romantic her parents’ courtship had been.

Her
historical novel To Elinor: A Romance in Two Voices is based on that 
courtship and was as much a means of understanding her parents as it was
a way to celebrate them and other couples like them.

‘I
learned so much about the war. I learned how tough it was. I learned 
how hard it was for these men, and how lonesome it was for them,’ Bartow
said. ‘But I also learned how tough it was on the women. It's like 
their lives stopped because all of the young men were gone.’

Darrow signed his letter 'Beat,' for his last name, which was Beaton. According to his daughter, Darrow numbered the letters so that Elinor could line them all up in proper order

Smitten: Darrow Beaton was fiercely intelligent, says Bartow, and his bad boy 'other side of the tracks' attitude made him fascinating to her bishop's daughter mother

Married: Despite the obstacle of a world war and several falters, the couple eloped in 1944 just hours before Darrow was shipped out to sea for the last time

To Elinor: Jane Bartow (pictured) has written a book about her parents based on the letters she discovered and describes the experience of uncovering their past an emotional one

'I learned so much about the war': Bartow says writing her historical fiction around her father's touching letters became a lesson about the war's high cost on the then youthful Greatest Generation
