A young woman is suffering from a rare condition that is causing her head to sink into her neck.

Nina Parsons’ condition is so severe that she has shrunk an inch and a half in the last two years - dropping from 5ft 5½in to just 5ft 4in.

The 30-year-old suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which weakens the collagen in her body.

Battle: Nina Parsons suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which weakens the collagen in her body. Her neck is also not strong enough to hold her head up, causing her to shrink

Slow progrerss: Miss Parsons' problems started at 23 when she began to suffer from symptoms associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and migraines. She also has type 1 diabetes and doctors believed the two problems were linked

She claims she will become paralysed if nothing is done to prevent her body from collapsing.

Doctors also believe she is suffering from a condition called Cervical Cranio Instability.

This
 means her neck is not strong enough to hold up her head and her brain 
stem is slowly being crunched by the pressure from her skull, causing her to shrink.

The former make-up artist is now attempting to raise £70,000 to fund an operation in America after losing her battle with the NHS to have treatment here.

Miss Parsons, from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'I do not want sympathy. I just wanted surgical help to get my life back and be the independent driven women I used to be, not being sick, in pain and stuck on benefits all my life.

'Wearing a hard collar is very uncomfortable, restrictive, and hot, but it allows me to get out of bed some days and sometimes it is the only indication that I am very sick.

'The smallest journey is living hell, inflicting vibration and jarring to my body, so even hospital appointments are huge pain filled ordeals.

Clues: Last year she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome due to her hypermobility. Her super flexible limbs and the way she can put her hands flat on the floor without bending her legs confirmed it

Miss Parsons said: 'I do not want sympathy. I just wanted surgical help to get my life back and be the independent driven women I used to be, not being sick, in pain and stuck on benefits all my life'

'I’ve had a headache for three years now and it just never gets better.

'I’m just desperate to get my life back. My own head is sinking - it’s sometimes called ‘pumpkin on a stick’ syndrome.

'If I do not get surgery I will eventually be paralysed and die It’s the only chance I have at a normal life.'

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited conditions that affect collagen proteins in the body causing them to be weak.

Typical features are stretchy skin, loose joints and fragile body tissues.

Collagen
 is a building block that strengthens and supports various body tissues -
 it is found in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, bone, blood vessels
 and the spine.

EDS is caused by alterations in certain genes - these can be passed from parents to their children.

The condition affects at least one person in every 5,000 in the UK.

There
 are various different forms of EDS. All share some common features, 
such as loose joints, abnormal skin and fragile body tissues, but each 
form of EDS has unique characteristics too.

The most severe form is Vascular EDS which causes the organs and blood vessels to be at risk of rupturing - this can be fatal.

Her problems started at 23 when she began to suffer from symptoms associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and migraines.

Miss Parsons also has Type 1 Diabetes doctors believed the two problems were linked.

So she carried on with as normal a life as possible, setting up her own bridal make-up business, meeting a long-term boyfriend and getting engaged.

At 26 she could no longer ignore the nausea and headaches that had come to accompany her stomach problems and returned to her doctors who diagnosed her with stress and dismissed her as a hypochondriac.

It was only then, when she felt like no-one was taking her seriously, that she began to look elsewhere to solve the mystery of her health problems.

Things took a turn for the worse when she fell down a set of wooden steps a year later.

Suffering from severe whiplash, her migraines worsened and she began to find it difficult to track objects with her eyes.

After spending thousands of pounds of her savings on tests and doctors, her diagnosis finally came at 29 with a simple test to see how flexible she was.

Hypermobility is one of the markers of Nina’s type of EDS. Her super flexible limbs and the way she can put her hands flat on the floor without bending her legs confirmed it.

She had always been more flexible than the average child, excelling at gymnastics at school, and had been able to pull her thumb in and out of its socket without any pain - but had thought it was normal.

But her headaches remained unexplained. In desperation she went online and found a specialist clinic in America who, after seeing her MRI scans, believe she also suffers from Cervical Cranio Instability linked to her EDS.

Hope: Miss Parsons believes that a pioneering operation in the U.S. could solve her problem by stopping fusing her skull to her spine to stop her head from pressing down any further

This means her neck is not strong 
enough to hold up her head and her brain stem is slowly being crunched 
by the pressure from her skull.

This is what it's thought has caused her height to drop by 1.5 inches.

Unable to work, her business collapsed and her relationship succumbed to the pressure of her extreme medical problems.

Fight: Miss Parsons is now attempting to raise £70,000 to fund an operation in America after losing her battle with the NHS to have treatment in the UK

Surgeons from America have advised her doctors in the UK  and offered to guide them through the procedure, but she was turned down for NHS funding.

She now faces a battle to raise the money to pay for treatment in America herself.

Lara Bloom, Chief Operating Officer of Ehlers-Danlos Support UK said: 'The problem is there is such a lack of medical specialists and research in this area.

'We need more awareness within the medical community and more research to prevent misdiagnosis and lack of diagnosis altogether.'

Since starting her fundraising just four weeks ago, Miss Parsons says she has been overwhelmed by support and has raised £3,000.
