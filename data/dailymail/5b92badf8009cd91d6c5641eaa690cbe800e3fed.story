A 21-year-old 'Breaking Bad' fan has been caught with a methamphetamine lab in his home - and he was sporting a T-shirt from the popular show when he was busted.

Acting on a tip, police raided the suburban Chicago home of Daniel Kowalski at around about 6:45 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from the Cook County Sheriff's office.

Officers found glass beakers, burners, chemicals, and instructional materials for making controlled substances in the La Grange Highlands property, the statement said.

Los Pollos: Daniel Kowalski, pictured, has been caught with a methamphetamine lab in his home and he was sporting a T-shirt, pictured, from the popular show when he was busted

Equipment: Officers found glass beakers, burners, chemicals, and instructional materials for making controlled substances, pictured, in the La Grange Highlands property

However, they said Kowalski wasn't cooking when they conducted the search.

Twelve jars of psychedelic mushrooms were also recovered.

Kowalski was wearing a 'Los Pollos Hermanos' T-shirt as he was taken into custody and when his mug shot was taken. Los Pollos is the chicken restaurant owned by Gustavo 'Gus' Fring, Walter White's boss. The restaurant acts as a front for Gus' meth dealing ventures.

Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart confirmed Kowalski's attire on Twitter Wednesday.

'For those asking, Daniel Kowalski was actually wearing a @Los_Pollos_ABQ shirt at the time of arrest,' he tweeted.

One clever follower responded, '@TomDart @Los_Pollos_ABQ Kowalski "Better call Saul."'

Saul is the ethically-dubious lawyer on the hit show.

Second time: This was the second time in less than a year a meth lab, pictured, was found in Kowalski's home

Charges: Kowalski has been charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance, possession of methamphetamine manufacturing materials, and possession of methamphetamine precursors, and a misdemeanor count of possession of drug paraphernalia

Dismantled: An Illinois State Police Clandestine Lab removal team responded and removed the chemicals and lab from the property in the La Grange Highlands area, pictured

Sheriff spokeswoman Sophia Ansari added to the Chicago Tribune: 'He obviously knows something about the show.'

Two other men were in the home during Monday's search and were taken into custody but released without charges, police said.

Kowalski was scheduled to appear Wednesday for a bond hearing at the Bridgeview Courthouse, according to the sheriff's office.

The 21-year-old's previous run in with authorities was in July 2013 when police found a suspected meth lab in the property.

He was ordered to home confinement after his arrest and had to wear an electronic monitor.
