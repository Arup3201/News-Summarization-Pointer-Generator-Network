An elderly Florida woman tried to smuggle to the Philippines thousands of dollars by hiding the cash in her undergarments and secret pockets sewn into her purse.

Federal officials say that Victoria Faren, 78, hid $21,000 of the money just in her girdle when she was trying to board a Delta flight out of Detroit Metropolitan Airport in April, court records filed on Friday show.

Along with her daughter, Cherryn Faren, 48, she tried to take nearly $41,000 in currency.

Federal law requires travelers to declare cash amounts worth more than $10,000.

US Customs and Border Protection officers first became suspicious of the elderly traveler when she told them she was carrying $200 â€” despite filling out a written declaration form indicating she had $1,200.

Suspicious, the officer searched the elderly woman's handbag and found $12,977 in a series of wallets and improvised cloth pockets sewed the purse, court records show.

Once again, the officer asked if that was all the cash she had.

'No, this is all the money,' Faren said, according to court records.

Officers kept searching and found another $3,000 inside her blouse and $2,000 that had been sewn into the strap of her bra.

She once again told officers that was all the money.

But a pat-down search revealed a bulge near her buttocks, and officers found another $5,000 in the back of the woman's girdle.

Faren broke into tears and eventually confessed to carrying as much as $21,000 in her girdle alone.

She told Customs officers that the money came from selling her home for $120,000.

Although she knew it was illegal to carry unreported cash, Faren said she didn't wire the money to the Philippines because she thought it would be safer to carry it, court records show.

Federal prosecutors have filed paperwork in Michigan to keep the $40,977.
