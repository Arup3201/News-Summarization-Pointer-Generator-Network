House hunters got into a bidding war for an inner-city home which measures just 3.7 metres wide - and despite its skinny size, the home sold for $1,030,000. 

The fashionable four-level terraced house located in Redfern, inner city Sydney sold on Saturday. 

David Servi, who is the director of Spencer and Servi, which sold the home told Daily Mail Australia an auction was held two weeks ago but the highest bid was only $950,000 and the owners decided not to take the offer because they believed the home was worth more.

He said their decision was right because the two-bedroom, two bathroom home sold for more $1 million on Saturday after four house hunters put in new bids to get their hands on the sought after property.

Mr Servi, who has more than 30 years experience in the Sydney housing market, said: 'We recommended to the owners that we thought it was worth more and we did. 

'It was worth them waiting an extra two weeks because they made an extra $80,000.

'The owners are now living in Ireland and have been renting it out for the last ten years, they probably bought the property for around $400,000.

'We were not surprised how much this went for because it's a sought after location and it is a nice house.

The sought after home boasts city views and is just a three minute walk from Redfern train station

'You need a spare $1 million these days to be able to buy any kind of property in the city and this is just an example of that. 

'It's unusual in that it is a modern terraced home, most terraced houses in the inner city are Victorian and this one is  just about 12 years old and you own the whole house.

The house, on Turner Street which is spread across four floors, is just a three minute walk from Redfern train station and also has its own car parking spot. 

The home has an open plan living and dining room with glass folding doors to balcony with polished hardwood floors throughout.
