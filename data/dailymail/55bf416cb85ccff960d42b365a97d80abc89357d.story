Busted: Sarah Espinosa crashed her car into a fire house on Monday night and was found with a snake wrapped around her neck which she had stolen and in possession of marijuana

Authorities say a New York woman who crashed her car into a Long Island fire house was found to be in possession of marijuana â€” and a stolen snake wrapped around her neck.

Nassau County police say 22-year-old Sarah Espinosa, of Albany, was driving on Jericho Turnpike on Monday when she crossed the median and collided with a vehicle.

They say she continued through the front door of the New Hyde Park fire house and hit two fire trucks.

Fire personnel found a small ball python around her neck and authorities say the snake was stolen from a nearby pet store before the accident.

'We heard a loud bang and then a second loud bang,' New Hyde Park Chief Steven Waldron told Newsday.

'As soon as she went through the doors, firefighters began the rescue.'

Espinosa was arraigned Tuesday on charges including petit larceny, reckless endangerment and driving while intoxicated. Bail was set at $5,000.

The police report from the incident stated that fire fighters who rushed to help Espinosa found 'a small ball python snake wrapped around the defendant's neck'.
