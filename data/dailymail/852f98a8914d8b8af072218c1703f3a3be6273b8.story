Hundreds of alcoholics have been refused liver transplants in the past five years because they have not been able to stop drinking.

More than 160 patients with severe alcohol-induced liver disease have been denied a transplant, including a teenager at King's College Hospital in London and two people in their twenties.

Doctors say liver disease victims are getting younger by the year and that the majority of those refused a liver transplant will soon die.

At University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, eight of the 12 patients who were declined a liver transplant died, including two in their twenties, according to the Sunday Times.

Doctors became concerned about the refusal of liver transplants after the death of Gary Reinbach, 22, from Essex, in 2009.

He died of liver failure after being denied a potentially life-saving transplant because he was not able to give up alcohol.

The NHS Blood and Transplant Service announced in April this year that alcoholics suffering from severe liver disease will be allowed to have transplants on the NHS for the first time.

It will affect those with 'severe alcohol-associated hepatitis' (SAAH), who have until now been excluded from transplants because the prognosis was so poor.

The scheme is controversial because there is a national shortage of suitable organs for transplant.

And critics say those who bring ill-health on themselves should not receive such help.

Rajiv Jalan, professor of hepatology at University College London believes that teenagers may be more susceptible to liver disease than adults.

'The enzyme systems in the livers of adults are geared up for more 'detoxification', which may explain the increased susceptibility of young people to the effects of alcohol,' he said.

He said it was correct to refuse transplants for the majority of alcoholics who fail to abstain for a period. 

But pointed out there are some who do not realise the harm caused by binge drinking until it is too late.

'Transplanting patients who are not able to abstain is likely to risk the survival of the organ, which is a scare resource,' he said.

'About 15 to 20 per cent of patients die while waiting for an organ. Every time that we decide to transplant someone, another patient will be disadvantaged and may well die.'

There were 549 patients on the NHS liver transplant list in March this year, an increase of 12 per cent from the previous year.

A spokesperson for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: 'The sad reality is that there aren't enough donated organs available for everybody who could potentially benefit from an organ transplant to receive one. 

'Around three people die every day across the UK in need of an organ transplant. 

'We remain committed to being transparent and providing an allocation system that is based on clinical need and benefit and is not judgemental. 

'That said, organs are transplanted into patients that are likely to have the best outcomes. There is guidance in place governing how patients are assessed for liver transplants and the decision whether or not to list a patient lies with the transplant team. 

'We need more people to support donation, to join the NHS Organ Donor Register and to let their families know they want to donate. Every potential organ donor is precious but unfortunately four out of ten families approached about donation do not give the go ahead.'
