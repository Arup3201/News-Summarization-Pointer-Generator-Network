A third of Scots want to see Britain run by a Labour-SNP coalition which could put Alex Salmond in the Cabinet.

Ed Miliband faces the grim prospect of a Labour wipeout north of the border, seriously damaging his hopes of securing an overall majority in the general election in May.

Now a new poll of voters in Scotland reveals they favour Mr Miliband being forced into a power-sharing deal with the SNP instead of going it alone.

Mr Salmond quit as Scottish First Minister and SNP leader after losing the referendum on his long-held dream for independence.

But he now plans to stand as an MP in May's general election, raising the prospect of him becoming a minister in a new coalition.

A Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper revealed that 35.1 per cent of Scottish voters would prefer to see a deal between Labour and the SNP. 

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has previously said she could not envisage the SNP entering a formal coalition with Labour, but could see the party negotiating a 'confidence and supply' arrangement.

However, Mr Miliband has failed to categorically rule out such an arrangement.

The poll showed that a majority Labour government was the second most popular result among Scottish voters, with 19.8 per cent backing such an outcome, while 13.8 per cent backed a Tory majority.

A total of 4.7 per cent of people want to see another Tory/Lib Dem coalition, while 8 per cent want to see Labour and the Lib Dems rule together, and 5.5 per cent would like the Tories and Ukip in power.

A further 9.3 per cent favour an SNP/Tory coalition, while 3.8 per cent back a Labour/Ukip pairing.

Despite losing the independence referendum in September, there has been a surge in support for the SNP.

In the Survation poll 46 per cent now back the SNP with just 26 per cent supporting Labour and 14 per cent backing the Tories. 

A further 7 per cent intend to vote Lib Dem, while the remaining 7 per cent support other parties.

It repeated at the election, the SNP would win 52 seats and Labour would be reduced to a rump of just six. 

SNP depute leader Stewart Hosie said: 'We are taking absolutely nothing for granted and will work hard for every vote in May.

'With Labour MPs voting with the Tories for GBP30 billion more austerity cuts, people across Scotland can put their trust in the SNP to stand up for their interests, and use our clout in a hung Westminster parliament to end austerity.

'And it's clear that there is widespread support for the greatest possible devolution of powers to Holyrood.

'But the Westminster Government simply isn't willing to give Scotland the powers we need to build a more equal society and more competitive economy - and that is why we need a strong team of SNP MPs elected next May to hold them to account, and ensure that they finally deliver on their vow to Scotland.'

The poll results for the general election would mean substantial gains in the number of SNP MPs returned to Westminster, contrasted with substantial losses for Labour in Scotland.

Many observers believe that Mr Miliband may need support from the nationalists to form a government.

Asked whether he will seek a coalition with the SNP if the election result is not conclusive, the Labour leader said earlier this month: ''I am not about deals and coalitions.'

But during the interview on BBC1's Andrew Marr show, he repeatedly refused to rule out a deal with Ms Sturgeon's party.
