Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman revealed that Falcao has agreed personal terms ahead of a potential £43million permanent move to Old Trafford.

Radamel Falcao scored his first goal in English football and then spelled out his desire to remain at Manchester United beyond the end of the season.

Falcao started repaying some of the money United have invested in him by scoring the winner in Sunday's 2-1 victory over Everton at Old Trafford.

The Colombian, who also cleared a Phil Jagielka off the line in the second half, is on loan from Monaco until the end of the season.

United will have to stump up £43million if they want to sign him permanently next summer and the Colombian hopes they do.

'Me and my family are happy here, and we would like to stay for many years at Manchester United' Falcao told MUTV.

Falcao's strike lifted United into the top four for the first time this season and secured their second consecutive win following the 2-1 victory over West Ham.
