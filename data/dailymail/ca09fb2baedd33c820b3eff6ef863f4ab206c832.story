A Wisconsin boy boy who was accidentally shot in the head while playing with a friend in a wooded area behind a home earlier this month has been identified as 11-year-old Eric Gutierrez.

Gutierrez was declared brain dead the day after he was shot in the forehead, and then taken off of life support the following day.

Authorities are still trying to determine exactly what happened that led to the gun firing. As of Friday, police would only say that the unidentified, 13-year-old friend was a witness to the shooting.

Tragic: Eric Gutierrez was fatally shot in the head last week in a field behind a home in Wisconsin

Accident: Gutierrez's family says they believe it was just a tragic accident, while police say the investigation is ongoing

'All the evidence - we're going through it to try to figure out exactly what happened,' Walworth County Sheriff David Graves told Gazettextra.com.

About 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, emergency crews were called to the wooded area behind a home on County Road K in response to a juvenile who'd been shot in the head.

Paramedics transported Gutierrez to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brain dead the following day.

Authorities found a handgun at the scene that appears to be the weapon used in the shooting. Other evidence was collected at the scene but law enforcement officials wouldn't reveal exactly what was found.

Brain dead: Gutierrez was declared brain dead on Thursday, but his family kept him on life support as doctors found recipients for his organs

Authorities interviewed the 13-year-old friend who witnessed the shooting. They are yet to reveal who fired the gun, or how the boys came into possession of the weapon. 

The boy's mother, Rebecca Galarza, has been posting updates about her son's condition on Facebook, as well as pictures of the boy in the hospital.

In one post, Galarza says she doesn't think her son was playing with the gun - she says her family believes that whatever happened was a tragic accident. 

When it became clear that her son would likely never recover, Galarza kept the boy on life support long enough for friends and family to come say goodbye, and for doctors to find transplant recipients for his organs.

Organ donor: According to his family, Gutierrez's organs saved the lives of six people, ranging in age from 17 to 60

Memorial: Gutierrez's family placed a cross and flowers at the site of the shooting following the boy's death

'Friends and family it is with a heavy heart I give this update about my sweet angel Eric,' Galarza posted on Facebook on Friday. 'We have found recipients for all of Eric's organs. YEAH!! unfortunately that also means that it is time to say goodbye. so at noon today Eric will go down to the O.R and begin the process of harvesting his organs. I am feeling so much pain and sickness and hurt today. I am proud of my son and I love him so much. I am going to be so lost without him. Because of his gift he will be saving 6 people ranging from 17yrs old to late 50's.'

According to a GoFundMe website setup to help his parents pay for funeral costs, Gutierrez leaves behind two sisters, two brothers, a mother and father.

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing.
