On the run: Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed is being hunted by counter-terrorism officers

Theresa May faced criticism in the Commons today after a suspected Islamist terrorist supposedly under close monitoring went on the run wearing a burka.

Somalian-born Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed is believed to have evaded police observation by disguising himself as a woman in Islamic dress.

The 27-year-old went to pray at a mosque in West London on Friday and has not been seen since, Scotland Yard announced last night.

Home Secretary Theresa May face criticism in the Commons today over the ability of the police and security services to track suspects through Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIM) notices.

It comes as the Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal probe into electronic tagging contracts handed to G4S and Serco.

Police released CCTV pictures of the Mohamed, apparently wearing the traditional garb.

Scotland Yard refused to comment on the offences he is suspected of.

However they said he was not ‘a direct threat to the public.’

His escape prompted renewed political debate about the role of the appropriateness of Islamic dress in British life.

It follows a court case earlier this year in which a woman was required to show her face to jurors and the judge while giving evidence.

Mohamed is one of a small number of terror suspects whose movements are restricted by a court order because of the threat they pose to the public.

Worryingly, he is the second person under a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures notice to have absconded in the past year. Nine such orders are in force.

Islamic clothing: Mohamed is seen leaving the An-Noor Masjid and Community Centre in Acton, west London

The coalition announced in 2011  it would end Labour's control orders regime used to track and disrupt terror suspects.

They were replaced by Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMS), which include restrictions on overnight residence, travel and finance.

TPIMS are imposed by the Home Secretary who is given access to secret evidence that cannot be placed before juries.

They do not allow for the relocation of suspects, as control orders did.

Unlike control orders, TPIMS also have a maximum time limit of two years.

Control orders could be extended year on year without limit, while TPIMs can be extended after a year for another 12 months before they expire.

Some liberty campaigners said TPIMs are control orders-lite, accusing the Government of bottling the decision on the future of counter-terrorism powers.

But others, include Labour, complaining that they are not tough enough and allow suspects to move around the country.

There were nine TPIMs in force as of August 31, including eight against British suspects.

It follows the disappearance on Boxing
Day of Ibrahim Magag who failed to return home on time to comply with 
his curfew. He has still not been found.

Mohamed's disappeared in a black cab in December after ripping off his electronic tag.

His disappearance is a major blow to 
police and the security services.

The
Metropolitan Police said Mohamed attended the An-Noor Masjid Mosque in 
Acton, West London, at 10am on Friday.

He was seen inside the mosque at 
3.15pm. A spokesman said he changed into Islamic clothing and ‘has not 
been seen since’.

A spokesman said: ‘The Counter Terrorism Command immediately launched inquiries to trace Mr Mohamed and these continue.

‘Ports
and borders were notified with his photograph and details circulated 
nationally. Public safety remains our priority.’ He said anyone who sees
him should call 999.

In
the Commons Mrs May insisted Mohamed does not pose a direct threat to 
the British public even though the 27-year-old is understood to have 
received training and fought overseas for al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based 
cell of the militant Islamist group al Qaida.

To
laughs and shouts from the Labour benches, Mrs May said: 'The police 
and security service have confirmed that they do not believe that this 
man poses a direct threat to the public in the UK.

'The reason he was put on a TPIM in the first place was to prevent his travel to support terrorism overseas.'

But Labour's Yvette Cooper said the 
disappearance of Magag and Mohamed was proof that the decision to 
replace control orders with TPMIs was a mistake.

Ms Cooper said: 'Since the Home 
Secretary got rid of relocation orders, got rid of control orders and 
brought in the weaker Tpims, two terror suspects have vanished.

Risks: Home Secretary Theresa May insisted that Mohamed posed no risk to the public

Concern: Mohamed is described as 5ft 8ins tall and of medium build

'Her policies brought these two 
terror suspects back into contact with their old networks, with people 
who could help them disappear and made it easier for these terror 
suspects to run off.'

She went on: 'TPIMs apply to a very 
small number of difficult cases and everyone recognises there was no 
perfect answer and there will always be challenges.

'But this Home Secretary has made it easier for serious terror suspects to disappear and that is irresponsible.

'She was warned about changing the 
law, she was warned about weakening controls, she was warned more people
would abscond and they have, twice.

'But still she won't act. The question on everyone's lips is how many more warnings does this Home Secretary need?'

Mohamed is described as 5ft 8ins tall and of medium build.

Magag,
28, was the first person to go missing while on a TPIM. It was later 
claimed he fled simply by jumping into a black cab. The case prompted a 
review of how such terror suspects are monitored.

TPIMS are a watered down form of control order which allow the courts to place restrictions on a terror suspect’s behaviour.

They can be required to obey a curfew, are banned from mixing with named individuals and using the internet.

Control orders were watered down in 2011 following demands from the Lib Dems who said they breached civil liberties.

Security Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘National security is the Government’s top priority and the police are doing everything in their power to apprehend this man as quickly as possible.

‘The police and security services do not believe that this man poses a direct threat to the public in the UK.

‘The Home Secretary, on police advice, yesterday applied to the High Court for an order protecting anonymity to be lifted in order to assist with their investigation.’
