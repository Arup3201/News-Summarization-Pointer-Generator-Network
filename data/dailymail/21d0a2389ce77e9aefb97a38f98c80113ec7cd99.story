Bans phones: Martin Stott, head of the Old Hall School in Wellington has initiated a 'digital detox' week

A headmaster is holding a 'digital detox' week to try to wean children and their parents off digital devices.

Martin Stott, head of the Old Hall School in Wellington, Shropshire, believes many youngsters are growing up unable to read people's body language or facial expressions because their eyes never leave mobile devices.

He thinks children should spend longer talking to each other, playing cards and people watching instead of being constantly absorbed by technology.

Speaking to The Times, he said: 'When we take school trips or holidays, we don't allow mobile phones. We're hoping to challenge children to live without their mobile devices for a week.'

Mr Stott is not completely opposed to technology. The Old Hall School in Wellington, which has pupils aged four to 11, uses digital devices during lessons and teaches basic programming and coding. 

But during the digital detox, the pupils will be encourages to spend more time talking to friends, reading books and attempting problem-solving puzzles.

Mr Stott believes today's generation of youngsters are missing out on key skills because of their digital addiction.

He added: 'You often see children in restaurants with iPads to entertain them while mum and dad chat over dinner. 

'It erodes family time and they're missing out on messages from body language and fcail expressions from those around them. People watching is a great pastime for many but I think it's been lost to a degree.'

Mr Stott says that families he has spoken to support the idea and have talked about renting cottages during holidays with no mobile phone reception or wi-fi signal.

He is urging parents to participate in the digital detox week and turn their mobile phones off when possible.

After banning mobile phones on a school trip to France, he was asked how the pupils were supposed to pass the time on the journey.

He said they should be playing cards, talking to each other and looking out of the window.

The idea of a digital detox has become increasingly popular in the last few hours and several camps have sprung up around the world.

One of the earliest was Camp Grounded in Anderson Valley, California - which allows zero access to phones, tablets, and other technology, with campers also banned from talking about work.

And as part of the program, everyone must use nicknames, to prevent people from using the camp as a 'networking opportunity'.

In the UK, a digital device detox centre to rehabilitate phone and internet addicts has sprung up in the Welsh countryside.

Aptly called ‘Unplugged Weekend’, it is nestled in the heart of the Brecon Beacons and runs festival-style weekends to help phone obsessives reconnect with real life.

The camp-style set-up, which is imported from the US where it has taken off, is designed to help wean addicts off their devices and discover nature.
