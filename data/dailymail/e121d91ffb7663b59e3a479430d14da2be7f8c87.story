A pet cat was left with three metal pellets in its face after being shot at by thugs three times.

Frank, the one-year-old black and white cat, had the pellets embedded in its nose and cheeks after the attack in Holyhead, Anglesey.

Owner Sharon Bibby discovered the pet covered in blood after being held down and shot at three times, by what is thought to have been a BB gun at close range.

The mother of three, who works in an internet cafe, found Frank injured after he stumbled his way back home.

And her brother Mike Smith says the family can't believe someone would be so cruel.

He explained: 'We can’t believe that anybody could do such a thing. There are some bad people out there.

'Sharon called me to say that her cat had been shot directly in the face three times.

'One was lodged in the jaw and two were higher up in the nose.

'The children are shocked and dismayed by it. We just want to expose these people and their disgusting behaviour.

'We are really keen to show the pictures so that people in the area keep their pets at home at night in case this happens to them.'

Ms Bibby was able to take one of the lodged pellets out herself but had to rush Frank to an emergency vet for the other two to be removed.

Mr Smith added: 'Frank’s a very lucky cat, he could easily have been blinded.

'He had to have antibiotics but the vet said he should be fine. They say cats have nine lives. Frank has had eight lives already.'

The incident has also been reported to North Wales Police who are investigating.

A force appeal said: 'Police in the Holyhead area are appealing for
witnesses and information after a cat was shot.'
