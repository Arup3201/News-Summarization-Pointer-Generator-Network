A police officer has been reprimanded after tweeting that he had ‘arrested the offenders’ over the attack of a 94-year-old woman in her bed.

Great-grandmother Emma Winnall was found unconscious and covered in blood when carers came to check on her on Tuesday morning last week.

She had a fractured skull, a broken arm and wrist and a partially severed finger. The beating was so severe that the frail widow's palms were bruised from her attempts to protect herself, while blood had splattered on to the walls behind her bed.

Battered: Emma Winnall was assaulted as she slept at her home in Moseley, Birmingham, some time between 9pm on April 30 and 9am the next morning.

West Midlands Police said a woman, 56, and a man, 28, were arrested at their home in the Hall Green area of Birmingham just before 6.30am on suspicion of assault. They have been taken to a police station in the West Midlands.

But PC Sanghar, who uses the name PC0318HSANGHAR, then tweeted: ‘Folks. I am happy to now tell you that I was part of the team today who arrested the offenders who assaulted Emma Winnall.’

An hour later he added: ‘Folks the arrest is brilliant but guilty by suspicion (as per law) so we still need help please from all of you.’

West Midlands Police last night apologised and said the tweets by PC Hanif Sanghar were 'wholly inappropriate'.

Chief Inspector Sally Seeley from West Midlands Police, said: ‘The man and woman arrested in connection with the attack on Emma Winnall are suspects. They are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

'Like most people, the officer who tweeted about his role in the double arrest, was shocked by the violent nature of the attack on Mrs Winnall and was keen to update people with the latest development in the case.

‘It is clear that in doing this, he used terminology which was wholly inappropriate.

‘The officer has been advised and the tweets removed. We apologise for any confusion or distress his comment caused.’

Mrs Winnall’s son John yesterday told how his mother would probably never return to her home.

Mr Winnall, from Birmingham, added: ‘My mum is not very well today but she was better last week.

‘I doubt she will go home now. She will probably go to a care home or something when she leaves hospital.

‘She was saying to me last week that she doesn't want to go home because she doesn't think she would be able to sleep. We are all just thankful she is safe and alive.'

Crimestoppers offered a £5000 cash reward in a move backed by West Midlands Police.

Mrs Winnall, who lives in Moseley, Birmingham, worked at the city’s small arms factory during the Second World War. She relies on a wheelchair to get around, and has lived alone since her husband Frank died in 2006, aged 91. 

She has five children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, some of whom have been by her side in hospital since the assault.
