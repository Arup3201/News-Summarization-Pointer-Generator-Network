The Globe Theatre in London took a break from Shakespeare this weekend to host the Alternative Miss World Awards. 

The beauty pageant - which is open to entrants of any gender or nationality - is supposed to be a celebration of everything unique, with drag, avant-garde design, PVC sculpture dresses and even automobile costumes featuring in the show. 

The competition mimics the official Miss World contest in that it has a day-wear, evening dress, swimwear and interview round, but that is where the similarities end.

Miss Zero +, real name is Sasha Frolova, being crowned Miss Alternative World 2014 at the Globe Theatre in London on Saturday. The beauty pageant - which is open to entrants of any gender or nationality - is supposed to be a celebration of everything unique 

The theme of this year's competition was neon numbers. 

Contestants are required to undergo a total transformation in the special costume round, with everyone encouraged to think outside the box and go further than just the typical man-to-woman drag costume.

This year the winner was Miss Zero +, whose real name is Sasha Frolova, of Russia. 

Founder Andrew Logan, who started the awards in 1972,said: 'It’s about transformation. 

'People say drag, which it is, man to woman or woman to man, but that’s a rather a lack of imagination, just doing man to woman when there is so much more that you can be.'

Andrew continued: 'I’ve always felt like I wan to encourage people - if I can inspire just a few then I’ve done something in this world.

'Of course it’s great fun, but it was always something more than that.' 

Artist Grayson Perry, who is almost as famous for his outlandish dressing as he is for his art, is a longtime supporter of the awards and hosted this year's competition.

He said: 'I always love it when you can see someone who makes the effort when they go out. 

'It’s like why you do your front garden - you might not sit in your front garden and enjoy it, but it makes the street nicer for everybody who’s walking down it.'

Judges this year were from a range of backgrounds and included the fashion designer Dame Zandra Rhodes, actress Zoe Wanamaker and Madness frontman Suggs, who met his wife at one of the early competitions.

The winner - Sacha aka Miss Zero + has taken part in the event twice before, once as a competitor in 2004, when she came third and once in 2009 as part of the cabaret. 

The 30-year-old Russian, who is a contemporary artist by trade, said: 'I have a show where I sing and perform in latex with inflatables, so my character int he pageant was connected to that. It was great that they chose me as the winner, I cried because it was like a gift from above. 

'It gets extremely hot inside the costume - I have to wear it for three hours at a time and all I change is the mask, but I love the way it looks - I feel like a plastic woman. 

'People should know that I am not a fetishist though, it is not a sexual thing for me - it is for performance art.'
