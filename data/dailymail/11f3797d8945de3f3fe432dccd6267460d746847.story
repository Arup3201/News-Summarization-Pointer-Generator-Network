Three weeks after the video footage taken on the Paris Metro which shamed Chelsea, an initiative is gathering support among fans to fight back against the racists who still attach themselves to the club.

Paris Saint-Germain visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg of a Champions League tie which will be forever tarnished by those Chelsea supporters who refused to let Souleymane S board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station as they sang: 'We’re racist and that’s the way we like it'.

Many Chelsea fans are keen to use the return fixture to send a collective message around the world, and have been inspired to produce flags, banners, posters and t-shirts to project the mood.

There will be posters, banners and flags showcasing Chelsea's stance against racism at Stamford Bridge 

There will be posters handed out, printed in both English and French which state: 'No Racism at the Bridge. That’s the way we like it.'

There will be t-shirts carrying the slogan 'We Only See Blue' and there will be flag hanging from the Matthew Harding Stand bearing a message: 'Blues Against Racism'.

Souleymane has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend the game but it is as if bearing witness to his experience, like something from Apartheid South Africa lurking amid the glitz of the Champions League, flicked a switch in the minds of thousands.

Rather than cringe and ignore the ever-diminishing faction of racists who have lingered around Chelsea since the 1980s – and other clubs, it must be said - supporters are getting active at ground-level with campaigns which has the potential to be more powerful than all those well-intentioned messages from the top of society.

Five of the Chelsea fans involved in the disgraceful incident have been suspended from attending matches 

Since the Metro footage went viral, another two incidents of racist abuse involving Chelsea-associated yobs singing on trains have been reported to police and are being investigated.

Ben Price, a 37-year-old gardener and Chelsea supporter since the early nineties, set up a Facebook page which he found gathered rapid support at home and abroad.

Paul Canoville, the club’s first black player, was quick to back the movement, as was Richard West, aka Mr C, the DJ and former frontman for the Shamen, who is a Chelsea fan.

Price was responsible for the 'No Racism at the Bridge' posters on show during the Burnley game, last month, and will be outside the Shed End, handing out more before the game against PSG.

'It’s a message that says that collectively we do not tolerate racism and we cannot be branded a racist club,' said Price. 'It’s a message for Souleymane S and for other clubs and their fans and for football’s authorities like UEFA and FIFA and hopefully we can send it around the world, because the eyes of the world will be on us.'
