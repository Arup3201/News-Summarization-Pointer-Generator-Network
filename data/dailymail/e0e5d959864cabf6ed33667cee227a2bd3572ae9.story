A jobless graduate found an innovative way of getting potential employers' attention - by plying them with bottles of beer labelled with his CV.

Brennan Gleason, a student from British Columbia in Canada decided to combine his talent for design and home-brewing to send an alcoholic resume instead of paper applications.

Mr Gleason, who studied  a graphic design course as the University of the Fraser Valley in Canada, combined his academic qualifications with a passion for home-brewing ale.

Smooth: Mr Gleason's Resum-Ale proved a hit with employers, and ended up winning him a marketing role

His own brand of dark beer - branded Resum-Ale - was bottled up and sent out in cases marked with details of his credentials and a link to his website.

The tactic won him three job offers in a matter of weeks, and he now works for a digital marketing company who were taken by his creativity - and his ale. 

Cheers: Mr Gleason managed to combine his graphic design skills with a love of home-brewing

Winning formula: When labelled up, the beers feature a QR code so that employers could see his work online

Mr Gleason said: 'I've always been inspired by those unconventional CVs and recently got into home brewing - so I thought why not put the two together.

'Each bottle features a piece of work from my portfolio with a little bit of info about it. It also features a QR code linking to the project on my website.

'This batch was well received which was awesome seeing as it was one of the first batches made.

'I'd been contracting with a company but I really wanted to work with them full time and gave them one and that sealed the deal.

'I love how relaxing home brewing is. It's a great way to spend an afternoon and just clear your head.'
