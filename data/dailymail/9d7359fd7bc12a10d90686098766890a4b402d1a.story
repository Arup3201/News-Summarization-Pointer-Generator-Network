Police in New York are monitoring a terrorist attack in Syndey, Australia, in which as many as 20 people have been taken hostage.

An armed siege is developing after either one of two gunmen marched into a Lindt cafe in the center of the city and forced sobbing hostages against the window.

Australian police have sealed off the surrounding streets amid fears the attacker or attackers have a shotgun and explosives. 

In light of the attack, the NYPD said they are 'aware of what's happening in Australia', and later added: 'We are monitoring the situation in Sydney.' The U.S. government has also evacuated its consulate in Sydney, which is very close to the scene of the confrontation.

Terrorists were today holding hostages in an armed siege in a cafe in Sydney where an extremist flag was held up in the window

A spokesman confirmed the evacuation. The consulate also issued an emergency warning to U.S. citizens in Sydney, urging them to 'maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security'.

President Obama has also been briefed on the situation by a homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser.

ISIS, the terror organization to which the hostage-takers are believed to be linked, routinely encourage their supporters to make small-scale 'lone wolf' attacks to be made against the West, particularly in the United States.

The FBI recently warned military personnel to disguise their presence on social media and suppress identifying information in case they become targets in a surprise attack. 

The Sydney incident began just hours after a 25-year-old suspect was arrested in a terror raid in Sydney.

Officials have also evacuated the Sydney Opera House after reports of a suspicious device. 

Martin Place has been shut down and scores of police are surrounding the building after the alarm was raised about 9.45am.

Journalist Chris Kenny, who was in the shop about 20 minutes before the siege began, said he understood the automatic glass sliding doors had been disabled.

'I did speak to a couple of people who saw a bit more of this unfold than I did,' he said.

'One woman said she tried to go into the shop just after I came out with my takeaway coffee but the doors wouldn't open.

'So obviously whoever is doing this has disabled the automatic glass sliding doors to stop anyone else going in and she said immediately she could see there was a weapon. 

'The woman was quite frantic but very clear what she was telling (the police).

'I know the faces of the people who are sitting there enjoying a morning coffee.'

The Seven Network newsroom, which is in a building opposite the cafe, has been evacuated.

Other buildings in Martin Place, including the nearby Westpac building, have been cleared.

'We're just recommending no one go near Martin Place at the moment,' a New South Wales Police spokeswoman said. 

Martin Place train station has been closed and public buses are being turned away.

A staff member at the Reserve Bank told Daily Mail Australia they were unable to be evacuated because Martin Place had been closed. Staff have been told to move away from the windows.

Another woman who works in the government building opposite the cafe tried to call her her office to say she couldn't get past cordons and all the phone lines were down.   

It was alleged that Omarjan Azari, the 22-year-old Sydney man arrested on terrorism charges in September, was planning a public beheading in Martin Place.

The alleged terror plot, mentioned in a conversation between Australian terrorism recruiter in Syria, Mohammad Ali Barylei and Azari, involved selecting a member of the public at random, beheading them and then covering their body in a flag.

The whole incident was going to be filmed, and then used as propaganda for the ISIS cause.

Federal prosecutors said the alleged terror plot was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'

Police Prosecutor Michael Allnutt said that Azari had made a threat which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute' during a telephone conversation with Baryalei.

Azari was arrested on September 18 and charged with preparing for an act of terrorism.

He is due in court this week for a bail application.

The flag being held up in the window of the cafe is believed to be a Shahada flag, which is used by the group Jabhat al Nusra.

At least two gunmen are involved in the siege but dozens of armed police have sealed off the streets surrounding the site

Jabhat al Nusra was formed in January 2012, in the Syrian civil war to fight the Syrian government forces.

Jabhat al Nusra, or JN, aims to overthrow the Assad regime and replace it with a Sunni Islamic state.

Although the group is affiliated with al-Qaeda, Jabhat al-Nusra does not emphasize Western targets or global jihad, focusing instead on the 'near enemy' of the Syrian state.  

Martin Place is one of Sydney's busiest streets and is at the center of the CBD. The Lindt cafe where the hostages are being held specializes in chocolate and has a number of branches across the city.
