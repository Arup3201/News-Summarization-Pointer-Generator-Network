Sir Peter Cosgrove was appointed Australia's 26th Governor-General in March this year

Sir Peter Cosgrove was appointed Australia's 26th Governor-General in March this year, replacing Quentin Bryce. 

A graduate of the Royal Military College, Cosgrove served in the Vietnam war and in 1999, became commander of the international peacekeeping mission in East Timor. He was appointed chief of the Australian Army in 2000 and the chief of the Defence Force in 2002, overseeing Australia's involvement in the Iraq war.

Earlier this year, Sir Cosgrove was the first man in Australia to be knighted under Prime Minister Tony Abbott's revived honours system.

'Every human being wants to be uplifted and inspired and I can think of no better man than Peter Cosgrove to maintain our national morale and to find faith in ourselves,' PM Abbott said at the Parliament House ceremony in March.

Sir Cosgrove told Australians at the time that he saw his role as the Queen's representative being 'to reflect the community to itself.' A role he and his wife Lynne embraced as 'the greatest honour.'
