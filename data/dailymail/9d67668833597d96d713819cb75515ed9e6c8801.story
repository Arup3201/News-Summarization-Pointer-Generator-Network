A baby girl is dead after the Florida Department of Children and Families failed to remove her from her drug addicted, violent parents, who had already been the subject of more than 10 reports to the state's abuse hotline.

Little Emma Morrison was just 49 days old when her mother, Lisa Lamoureaux, 33, found her lifeless in her crib at around 9:30 a.m. on January 17 after putting her to sleep nine hours earlier and failing to check on her.

The murky circumstances surrounding her death are still being investigated by Palm Beach County sheriff's Office and the medical examiner.

Lamoureaux had a long history of drug abuse, she had been arrested nine times and her four older children had been permanently taken from her by the state, according to the Miami Herald. But the newspaper reported DCF's only action after Lamoureaux gave birth to Emma late last year was to refer her to parenting classes that she turned down or was unable to get access to.

Authorities also failed to ask whether the woman was still abusing drugs before deciding to leave the baby in her care.

Emma's father, Dwayne Morrison, had an even more worrying past.

The 48-year-old had been arrested 35 times since 1992 with charges including kidnapping, robbery, battery, aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, fraud, contempt of court, escape, and drug charges, the Herald reported.

Records show the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office had made 'numerous' calls to the home Lamoureaux shared with Morrison and, while the woman was pregnant with Emma, he had been the subject of two domestic battery calls and was arrested twice.

But on both occasions, Lamoureaux dropped charges against him.

On December 13, the mother called the DCF's abuse and neglect hotline after Morrison slapped her in the face while she was holding the newborn, but, as in the past, she dropped the charges and Morrison was released from jail.

The Herald reported that DCF referred the case to three service providers and then stopped monitoring the family. But none of the programs - Family Preservation Services, Boys' Town and Triple P Parenting - had a chance to act before Emma's tragic death.

DCF spokesman Joe Follick told the Herald that it was 'very easy for others to indulge in hindsight second-guessing.'

'The threshold is very high for the state to remove a child from his or her mother, especially when there are no clear signs of imminent danger or abuse,' he said. 'The reality of making decisions on separating an infant from his or her mother is a much more complex process that every employee at the department takes very seriously.'

He added that every death 'affects us deeply' but refused to release any details on the investigation surrounding Emma's death.

'We have reviewed the history of this family and the investigation of this case. It would be entirely premature and reckless to speculate on the cause of death while local authorities investigate,' he told the newspaper.

After a similarly harrowing infant death in 2008, Florida introduced a policy called the Ludwig Protocol that requires DCF staff to look closely at infants born to parents already being investigated for abuse or neglect.

But in a January 24 email, DCF's top child welfare attorney, Mary Cagle acknowledged that the protocol had been overlooked in this case.

The investigators 'never set a Ludwig staffing with (Children's Legal Services) before the baby was born... as is required,' Cagle wrote, according to the Herald.

The newspaper quoted a review that found any record of Emma's mother's history of drug abuse was 'missing' from her file as was the family's long history with DCF - her parents had at least 11 prior contacts with the department. It said that 'there is not an assessment of the (agency's prior history with the family) or criminal history' in any records before the little girl's sad death.

Neither Lamoureaux or Morrison has been charged in Emma's death and the investigation into what happened is continuing.
