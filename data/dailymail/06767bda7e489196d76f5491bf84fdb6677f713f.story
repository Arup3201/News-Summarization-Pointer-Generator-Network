A former high school teacher accused of having sex with a 17-year-old student has taken a plea deal to avoid prison.

Lauren Redfern, 26, pleaded guilty yesterday to a felony charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

The plea is not an admission to having a sexual relationship with the male student who attended Basalt High School outside of Aspen, Colorado.

Allegation: Lauren Redfern, 25, turned herself in to authorities after she was allegedly discovered in the bathroom having sex with one of her students

The illicit affair between the physical education teacher and her student was unearthed when the two were found allegedly having sex in the school bathroom of the teacher’s office on February 9.

Redfern does not face prison time and she will not be added to the sexual-offender registry, Eagle County District Attorney Mark Hurlbert told the Aspen Times.

The plea agreement still needs final approval from a district judge and a sentencing hearing was set for June 26.

Redfern is likely to be place on probation for two years and a protection order remained in place to prevent contact with her former student.

Without the deal, she could have faced anywhere from four to 16 years in prison and the Class Three felony charge of two counts sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust.

She no longer works as a teacher and was training to become a cross-fit instructor. 

The athletic director of Basalt High School outside of Aspen, Colorado, reportedly found 26-year-old Lauren Redfern and one of her male students engaged in a sexual act, an affidavit stated.

High school: Redfern graduated from Basalt High School in 2004 and was a star of the basketball team

Redfern, who graduated from the high school in 2004 and was a star basketball player in her day, turned herself into the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office in February, and was charged with sexual assault on a child by a person in position of trust.

Redfern had been the teen’s study hall teacher. Though the student is of-age now, their affair had started when the boy was a minor, the sheriff’s office said.

Eagle County Undersheriff Mike McWilliam said ‘the juvenile and teacher had sexual conduct at her house and at his house.’

The alleged affair is believed to have lasted for three to four months. Per Colorado state law, a 17-year-old can have a sexual relationship with an adult of any age as long as it is consensual. However, the latter cannot be considered a person of trust.

Mr McWilliam told MailOnline that a person of trust is 'anybody who would be responsible for care -  namely, we use it for teachers.'

He added: ‘If she weren’t a teacher, it wouldn’t be a criminal act.'

Hearing: Redfern appeared in court in February after handing herself into police over the alleged affair with a teenage student

In the affidavit, she said that the relationship with the student was ‘unintentional.’

The two began exchanging flattering texts last fall, the documents show. By Christmas, ‘they both felt attracted to one another,’ it read.

Redfern told authorities that the relationship began when the student was over at her house in Eagle County watching a movie. During the film, the two kissed and touched each other, but nothing more happened, the affidavit said.

The student called Redford for assistance with a school paper two weeks later, the document stated. He then went over to her house for help, where the two allegedly had sexual intercourse.

The couple had sex at least five times after that, Redfern told authorities – both when he was underage and after he turned 18.

The student also met with authorities, telling them that he pursued his teacher romantically and that they shared similar interests, according to the affidavit.
