A seven-year-old girl was airlifted to hospital in Georgia on Monday after falling about 50ft into a well at her grandparents' house.

Megan Winters was left with bleeding on the brain and broke several bones including her hip, leg and arm, after falling headfirst into the dry well at about 2.45pm.

It took more than an hour for firefighters to lift Megan to safety and, because the well was so narrow, the rescue crew had to send their smallest member in.

'She was in an awkward position, face
 first, so itÂ  took us a while to get her maneuvered around,' Lieutenant
 Clay Kierbow, who was lowered into the well to rescue Megan, said.

'Luckily there was only a little bit of wetness down there but no standing water.'

Megan had been playing in her grandparents' yard when plywood covering the disused well gave way beneath her.

'They
 were out here playing, and my grandchild came in and told me Megan had 
fallen in the well,' the child's grandmother Jean McCollum told the Times Georgian.

'I've told them a hundred times to stay away from that old well.'

Megan's mother, who has not been named, said her daughter had been jumping on the well cover, which had been weakened by rain.

She told ABC News that her daughter had been 'very lucky' and thanked Lieutenant Kierbow for saving her.

Firefighters set up a pulley system to lift Megan from the well and family members helped the crew lift her out.

Despite
 her injuries, Megan was conscious during the rescue and, after being 
hoisted out of the well she was flown to a children's hospital.

Danger: Rain had damaged the well cover, which gave way as Megan was playing on it

According to Facebook posts from the girl's mother, seen by WSB-TV2, Megan broke her leg in three places and suffered other breaks.

Later on in the evening it was discovered that she had bruising and bleeding on the brain.

She had five hours of surgery at Atlanta's Children's Hospital and is listed as being in critical condition.
