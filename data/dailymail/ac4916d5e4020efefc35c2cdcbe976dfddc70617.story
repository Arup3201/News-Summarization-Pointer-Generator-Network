Repeating her vows in front of loved ones, Lisa Parcel promised to love and honour her new husband.

But the 27-year-old had already made one more unconventional yet priceless promise, to donate one of her kidneys to the man standing before her at the alter.

Lee Parcel was battling kidney failure when the couple tied the knot a year ago.

His devoted partner of 14 years was ready to donate one of her organs, just as soon as doctors said the 33-year-old was well enough for a transplant operation.

But time ran out and Mr Parcel passed away before his wife had the chance to fulfill her life-saving promise, donating his own organs to help save the lives of three others awaiting transplants.

Lee Parcel passed away with his wife Lisa by his side, before she could donate one of her kidneys to him as a wedding gift

Mrs Parcel said: 'I'm heartbroken but I am a very lucky girl to be able to say I was his wife.

'He was an inspiration to us all. It was so hard kissing you goodbye.'

The couple had been together for 14 years before Mr Parcel proposed to the 'love of his life', just before he fell ill three years ago.

The diabetic was diagnosed with serious kidney failure, placed on an emergency dialysis treatment programme and warned he needed a transplant if he was to survive.

When Mrs Parcel was found to be a match for her then fiancee, the couple could not believe their luck.

The 27-year-old told her husband-to-be she would give him the 'ultimate wedding present'.

At the time, Mr Parcel said: 'There is nothing I can say or do to thank my wife for a new life - there's no repayment for that.

'What Lisa is doing isn’t just giving me a kidney. It’s a massive operation and comes with a lot of psychological issues. It’s not an easy process for the donor or recipient to endure.

'But she knows how much I appreciate it because she sees what I go through every day, or should I say what we go through every day.

'All we can do is be there for each other.'

The couple, from Cardiff, got married in June last year, while Mr Parcel was having daily dialysis.

Three years ago Mr Parcel, a diabetic, was diagnosed with serious kidney failure. He was put on emergency, daily dialysis and doctors warned he would need a transplant in order to survive

He passed away with his wife Lisa by his side less than a year after they married last June. He donated his organs to help save the lives of three others waiting for transplant operations

They had hoped to have the transplant operations six months later, and had plans to travel around the world when they had both recovered.

But complications with Mr Parcel's health prevented doctors from beginning the transplant preparation process.

Mr Parcel's condition deteriorated rapidly and he died with his wife at his bedside in intensive care at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, near Llantrisant in South Wales.

'I'm heartbroken but so lucky to have been his wife'

Just four days before his death Mr Parcel posted a poignant last message on Facebook: 'It’s such a cruel world.'

Knowing better than most the vital importance of donors, Mr Parcel had arranged for his organs to be donated following his death.

His wife, Mrs Parcel, a mental health nurse, said: 'After he died Lee had an operation to donate his organs to three people who need them.

'Lee was so strong and brave throughout his life.

'I can only hope we can muster up a tiny bit of strength to get us through this.'
