These images could be mistaken for scenes from a Hollywood movie, but instead the action was part of a counter terrorism drill by Los Angeles law enforcement officials held on Thursday.

SWAT team members engaged actors and police officers pretending to be terrorists during a live demonstration on the streets of downtown L.A. for the 2013 National Homeland Security Conference.

The purpose of the drill, conducted by law enforcement officials from the L.A. Police Department and L.A. Sheriff department, was to highlight various counter terrorism tactics in response to a mock incident involving armed gunmen and weapons of mass destruction.

Spectators gathered to watch as an actor pretended to detonate a suicide vest and SWAT team members and pretend terrorists shot at each other.

Other scenarios being played out during the drill included a remote controlled bomb squad forklift lifting a truck and SWAT team members descending from a helicopter.
