David Cameron said he and Nick Clegg are not friends as the Lib Dems went to war again over plans to redraw constituency boundaries.

The Prime Minister insisted the coalition will last until 2015 despite the most heated disagreement of the government so far in recent weeks over House of Lords reform.

But he made clear that the days of a chummy alliance with Mr Clegg - exemplified by their appearance at the Downing Street rose garden in 2010 - are a thing of the past.

Mr Cameron's admission came as Mr Clegg 
delivered his clearest signal yet that he will block plans to redraw 
constituency boundaries which could give the Tories a boost of 20 seats 
at the next election.

The Lib Dem leader has ordered his party to select their parliamentary candidates using the old boundaries.

Mr Clegg vowed to block the boundary review after Tory MPs refused to support his plans to reform the House of Lords.

But the move dashes hopes in Tory high command that the Lib Dems might change their mine before the vote due next year.

It means Labour and the Lib Dems will be able to select candidates who 
can campaign for three years in the correct wards, while Tories will 
have to stick to the pretence that the boundaries might change unless Mr
Cameron throws in the towel.

The spat has strained coalition relations.

Mr Cameron joked he and Mr 
Clegg should play volleyball to boost their team work and partnership 
but he told ITV1's Daybreak he and the Deputy Prime Minister were not 
close enough to eat together.

'It's not friends as in we go out for happy meals together,' he said.

However, the Prime Minister insisted that the government would still 
last until 2015. He said: 'This coalition will go all the way, there is a
lot more for us to do.

'You will see us this autumn coming out of the starting blocks - maybe 
not quite as fast as Usain Bolt - with a really packed programme of what
we want to do for this country.'

Lib Dem plans to finish off the 
boundary review were revealed in an email sent to party members in the 
London region which reveals that Mr Clegg has decreed that all 
selections of prospective Parliamentary candidates for 2015 will be 
based on 2010 general election boundaries.

'The Liberal Democrats in Government will be opposing any proposed 
boundary changes for the 2015 General Election, as a direct response to 
the Conservative backbench opposition to Lords Reform,' the email reads.

'It is therefore very unlikely that the planned boundary changes will 
be able to go ahead for this electoral cycle.'
