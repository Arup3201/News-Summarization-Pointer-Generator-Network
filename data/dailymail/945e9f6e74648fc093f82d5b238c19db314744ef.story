A woman who discovered her mother after she was sexually assaulted and fatally beaten will tonight watch the murderer be put to death in Missouri.

Debbie Decker, 57, said before Paul Goodwin, 48, is given a lethal injection just after midnight in Bonne Terre, she plans to shout: 'I hope you rot in hell!'

'It will be 16 years, nine months, 10 days,' Decker told the Salt Lake Post Dispatch. 'I've been sitting back waiting for this to happen. I'm hoping all these bad memories will go away.'

Goodwin has admitted to sexually assaulting Decker's mother, Joan Crotts, a 63-year-old widow, before beating her repeatedly with a hammer on March 1, 1998.

Facing death: Paul Goodwin, 48, (pictured left in 2001 and right this year) will be put to death at 12.01am on Tuesday for sexually assaulting and beating an elderly widow to death in 1998

He had previously lived in a boarding house next door to Crotts and blamed her for getting him evicted months before and returned to her home for revenge, prosecutors said.

The night before the attack, Goodwin, who stands at 6ft 7 tall, drunkenly broke into the home and hid in the basement until the following morning, when he pounced on the 4ft 9 widow.

He sexually assaulted her, then threw her down the basement stairs and hit her in the head with a hammer three times.

Before leaving, Goodwin left a scrap of paper on the kitchen table reading: 'You are next.' Decker believes that message was for her.

Victim: He attacked his former neighbor Joan Crotts for getting him kicked out of a boarding house

She discovered her mother, who was covered in blood but still alive. She had a broken hip, eight fractured ribs and massive head trauma and passed away while undergoing brain surgery that night.

Police tracked down their suspect after finding a hearing aid belonging to Goodwin in the woman's backyard, and finding his fingerprints inside the house.

Decker confessed but at his trial, his attorney used an insanity defense and said that the defendant had mental disabilities and a low intelligence level.

A prosecution psychiatrist said Goodwin knew what he was doing and he was sentenced to death.

Ahead of his death tonight, his attorneys are still trying to appeal the decision.

Decker and other family members will travel to the prison today and watch the killer die. She said that she has lived in fear ever since the murder and needs to know he can no longer get her.

'I've had a fear since he's been locked up, as big as he is he could break out if he wanted to,' she said. 'There's always a way to break out of prison. I never trusted the fact that he couldn't. I need to make sure in my own mind that that man is dead.'

Scene: He broke into her home in St Louis, pictured, and hid in the basement until the following morning, when he attacked her. He left a note behind reading 'You are next' - which Crotts' daughter believes was for her

Death chamber: He will be the 10th person to be put to death in Missouri this year - a record for the state

Her brother, Bob Decker, 61, will also be there

'I just want to see the finality, that's all,' Bob Decker told the Post Dispatch. 'There's nothing he could say that would bring my mother back or to make us feel better. There is nothing he could say to his family and all the pain he brought them.' 

Goodwin's sister, Mary Goodwin Mifflin, previously said in an affidavit seeking clemency that her brother is so mentally disabled that he doesn't realize what is happening to him.

'It is just too much for him to comprehend,' Mifflin wrote.

His death will be the 10th in Missouri this year - a record for the state. Only Texas, with 10, has performed more executions this year.
