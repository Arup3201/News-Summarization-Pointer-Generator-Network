Republican Senator Marco Rubio's 12-year-old daughter, Amanda, was involved in a motor vehicle accident Saturday in Miami while he was campaigning elsewhere in Florida with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

Amanda, the oldest of Rubio’s four children, is described as being 'in fair condition' at 
Miami Children’s Hospital. She was airlifted to the hospital following the 
accident.

Senator Rubio was notified of the 
accident after coming off stage Saturday afternoon while campaigning with Governor Romney 
in Kissimmee, Florida.

Sen. Marco Rubio was informed that his daughter had been in an accident while he was traveling with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney

The senator from Florida had been traveling aboard the Romney campaign 
bus when it pulled over shortly before 7 p.m. ET. Rubio exited and was driven away by a state trooper.

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant wrote in an email late Saturday
that Amanda, who is the senator's oldest daughter, was injured that afternoon.

'While visiting with classmates, she was a passenger on
a golf cart involved in a collision in a private gated community,' Conant
wrote. 'She was airlifted to Miami Children's Hospital with a head injury.
She has been admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.

'Senator and Mrs. Rubio are grateful for all the
outpouring of support and prayers,' he added, including calls from
President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden and a personal message from
Romney.

expressed his concern and hope for Amanda Rubio's quick recovery.'

The Miami Herald reports that the senator and his family were with Amanda at the
hospital. She has suffered a concussion and was expected to remain at the hospital overnight for observation.

The senator campaigned with Romney at 
two Florida rallies on Saturday and was scheduled to attend a third 
before being picked up by a state police cruiser along Romney's 
motorcade route.

Rubio and his wife Jeanette have three other children: Daniella, Anthony, and Dominic. They live in West Miami, Florida. He kept his family in his hometown after being elected to the U.S. Senate, preferring to commute to Washington from his West Miami home.
