In a private room at one of Roy Hodgson’s favourite London restaurants on Thursday, England’s head coach confirmed that Harry Kane is to dine at the top table from now on.

Hodgson was in the celebrity haunt, Scott’s of Mayfair, chewing the fat over the darling of English football after 23 goals in a Tottenham shirt drew him to national attention.

Next month, when Hodgson names an England squad for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on March 27 and a friendly in Italy four days later, Kane will be the signature dish.

England’s head coach said: ‘Is he worth a place in the squad now? Of course he is.

‘We bought a lot of young players in during my time. We had Saido Berahino in the last squad.

‘He (Kane) certainly deserves a place in the squad as much as, say, Saido did.

‘Is he worthy of a place like Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge or whoever? Well, that’s something he’ll have to prove.

‘Unless I give him a chance in the squad he’ll never get a chance to prove that anyway. Certainly, I like to think I do show a certain degree of loyalty to players who have been playing for a while and who I know I can trust.

‘But I also like to think that I’m prepared to give someone a chance when he’s really showing with his current form that he’s worthy of a place with us. Tim Sherwood started it with Harry Kane at the end of his reign last year by putting him in the team and he didn’t do badly.

‘Now Mauricio (Pochettino) has put him in and I’m delighted for us, delighted for the lad as well because he looks like the sort of player who has had to work very hard for his success. It’s not something that’s come overnight, he’s had to put in a lot of hard work.’

Hodgson also had praise for Danny Ings, the Burnley striker who continues to score goals for a team that has been deep in the relegation mire all season.

Ings, 22, has scored nine times for Sean Dyche’s team in his maiden season in the Barclays Premier League and is expected to join Liverpool when his contract expires in May.

Hodgson added: ‘Danny Ings has impressed me as well, when we had that get-together, when I was watching the Under 21s and he impressed me. I think we need to keep an eye on him.

‘John Stones is now back from injury, that’s good news for us. I am lucky at the moment, quite a few players have already started to make their mark. Ryan Mason is another one - I like the look of him as well. Jordon Ibe is very young, but we have a lot of young players like that he would have to jump over.’

21-year-old Kane has now scored 13 Premier League goals for Spurs, including two against Arsenal

There are hurdles for Berahino to overcome after he was banned from driving for 12 months in January after pleading guilty to drink- driving on the M6 in Cheshire last year.

Hodgson promoted the West Brom striker into the senior squad in November, but he has been reprimanded by the increasingly powerful figure of the FA’s director of elite development, Dan Ashworth.

The England head coach added: ‘It’s been dealt with. He has been reprimanded and as far as we are concerned the matter is closed.

‘It is up to him to put that behind him and show with his future behaviour that he has taken the reprimand on board.’

Hodgson also spoke about Jack Wilshere after the Arsenal and England midfielder was pictured holding a shisha pipe in London on the night of the Super Bowl. England’s head coach, like Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, insisted he had no issue with it and even admitted that he had smoked shisha in the past.

Hodgson said: ‘I thought tobacco was smoking and shisha pipes were water with flavour — well you are blowing in and you’re blowing out.

‘As an ex-cigar smoker, when I tried shisha I thought it was a complete nonsense, I couldn’t understand who would do it.

‘Apart from a faint fruity taste in your mouth that was about the end of it. As far as I am concerned that is a club matter and Arsene dealt with it very, very well.

‘If you are asking me, in an ideal world is that an ideal thing to happen? Of course it isn’t, but we don’t live in an ideal world.’
