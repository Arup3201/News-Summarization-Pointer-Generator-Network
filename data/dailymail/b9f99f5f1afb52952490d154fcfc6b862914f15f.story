A previously unknown painting by John Constable has been discovered by museum staff working on an exhibition dedicated to the artist.

The oil sketch, believed to show a kiln on Hampstead Heath in north London, dates to around 1821 and was concealed beneath the lining on the back of a painting of the nearby Branch Hill Pond.

It will go on show in a specially-designed display case showing off both sides of the work in the exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Discovered: The oil sketch, believed to show a kiln (centre) on Hampstead Heath, north London, dates to around 1821, and is on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum

Hidden: Museum staff discovered the new work concealed beneath the lining on the back of this painting of the nearby Branch Hill Pond in London

Masterpiece: The exhibition, called Constable: The Making Of A Master, includes The Hay Wain, perhaps his greatest work, pictured, and a sketch version of the painting

The picture was one of more than 300 sketches, drawings and paintings given to the museum by Constable's daughter in the 19th century.

Museum director Martin Roth said: 'The V&A has been one of the leading centres for Constable research since the 19th century, following a significant gift of paintings, oil sketches and drawings from Constable's daughter Isabel in 1888.

'This exhibition refreshes our understanding of his work and creative influence. It shows that Constable's art, so well-loved and familiar to many of us, still delivers surprises.'

The exhibition, called Constable: The Making Of A Master, includes his masterpiece The Hay Wain and a full-sized sketch version of the work.

Constable, who died in 1837, was a farmer's son who started sketching the countryside of his native Suffolk before going on to study at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.

The show, which runs from September 20 to January 11, also includes copies Constable made of the Old Masters and pictures from his own vast private art collection.

Despite Constable's work now fetching huge fees, he was not financially successful while alive

Born in Suffolk in 1776, John Constable is considered one of the foremost British artists.

Largely self-taught, he was influenced by Dutch painters - and is best known for his landscape paintings in Dedham Vale, the area in which he grew up.

Perhaps his most famous painting, The Hay Wain, is now exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum as part of the Constable: The Making Of A Master exhibition.

Finished in 1821, The Hay Wain was one of six large canvases depicting the area around Flatford Mill in Suffolk.

Another in the series, The Lock, became one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold when it fetched £22.4million at auction in 2012.

Constable was a farmer's son who started sketching the countryside of his native Suffolk before going on to study at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. 

Earlier this year, a previously unknown sketch by John Constable that is said to be an early inspiration for his famous work The Hay Wain today sold for £42,000 - six times its estimated value.

The small pencil drawing of a horse and plough was one of seven 'lost' works produced by the 18th century English painter which went under the hammer for a total of £222,000 (with fees added on), far exceeding the original expected sum of around £60,000. 

Despite his works now attracting huge fees, Constable was not financially successful in life.

The sketches, and an eighth by Constable's son, Lionel, were bought in a London art store in 1952 by the current owner's father for £500. 

He did, however, have considerable success in Paris during his lifetime.  

He also struggled to gain recognition from his peers and was not elected into the Royal Academy until the age of 52.

Between 1833 and 1836 Constable lectured on landscape painting at the Royal Institution, the Hampstead Literary and Scientific Society, and the Worcester Athenaeum 

He died in March 1837, aged 60, of apparent heart failure, and was buried with his wife.

His children John and Charles are also buried in the tomb.
