Pleaded guilty: Adrian Lubecki admitted playing a role in the supply of a class A drug known as PMMA

A teenage punk today pleaded guilty to supplying a dangerous batch of ‘Superman’ ecstasy pills linked to the deaths of four men.

Adrian Lubecki, 19, appeared at court via video link and admitted playing a role in the supply of a class A drug known as PMMA.

Police have seized more than 400 of the tablets but still do not know how many of the red, triangular pills are in circulation.

The batch has been linked to the deaths of three men around Ipswich, Suffolk, and a fourth in Telford, Shropshire.

Ipswich Crown Court heard Lubecki, who is Polish but lives in Ipswich, played a significant role in dealing drugs. Peter Gair, prosecuting, told the court there was evidence through text messages of Lubecki dealing the drugs.

Lubecki admitted one charge of being concerned in the supply of a class A drug to another between December 21 and January 2.

He also pleaded guilty to possessing the class B drug amphetamine with intent to supply on January 2.

Police launched a hunt for the tablets following the deaths of Lithuanian-born Justas Ropas, 22, and Gediminas Kulokas, 24, in Ipswich.

Mr Ropas died on Christmas Eve and his fellow countryman died on New Year’s Eve.

On New Year’s Day, John Hocking, 20, was found dead in the village of Rendlesham, Suffolk, the same day as Daniel Bagnall, 27, 180 miles away in Telford.

Lubecki was remanded in custody to appear for sentencing at the same court during the week starting on February 16.

A second man, Damian Malolepszy, 28, of Telford, is charged with being concerned in the supply of ecstasy and possession with intent to supply a controlled drug.

Malolepszy is remanded in custody and his case will be heard at Shrewsbury Crown Court on March 9. He is yet to enter a plea.
