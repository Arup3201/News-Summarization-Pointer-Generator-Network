Sara, pictured with daughter Mia, became curious about what could have caused her bolt of panic

Giving birth is one of the most momentous challenges in a woman's life. For the rare few, it is an unmitigated joy; for most, an excruciatingly painful means to an end.

For some women, though, like Sara Bran, childbirth is truly terrifying - but not for the reasons you'd expect.

Her two daughters, Lily, 16, and Mia, seven, were born nine years apart in very different circumstances. But common to both births was Sara's sixth sense that something terrible was about to happen.

'On both occasions labour stopped when I was exactly 4cm dilated. Quite simply, I froze with fear and my whole body seemed to go into lockdown. I had to have a traumatic emergency Caesarean section.'

Following Mia's birth, Sara, 45, became curious about what could have caused this sudden bolt of paralysing panic, and decided to look into her family history.

What she discovered shocked her. A hundred years ago, as her great- grandmother was giving birth to Sara's grandmother, her toddler son's clothing caught alight on an open fire and he came running into the room in flames. He died three days later.

It set Sara thinking. The overwhelming panic she'd encountered was sudden and came out of nowhere, probably much like that experienced by her poor relative all those years ago. Could she have inherited the sense of trauma from her great-grandmother?  

There is no doubt that a woman's 
experience of childbirth is often similar to her mother's and 
grandmother's. Most doctors and midwives recognise the likelihood that 
we will inherit a physiological similarity from our mothers.

But could 'ancestral memory' of specific events and experiences also play a part?

Having interviewed many women for a book I've co-written on the subject, I am convinced the answer is yes.

From
the impact of war, to illegitimacy, insanity and other family secrets, 
all these have ways of re-emerging down the generations.

Sara, who lives in London, questioned 
several relatives. 'I became aware, through half-told stories, that 
there was a lot of tragedy connected to motherhood in my family 
history,' she says.

Hence the story of Irene, her paternal great-grandmother and an Irish immigrant in New York in the early 1900s. 'An aunt told me that for the rest of her life, Irene was overwhelmed by the loss of her son,' adds Sara.

'What echoed was the sense I had that birth was synonymous with death, and that if I let my body go, something terrible would happen,' she explains. 'It was as if I still held the horror of what had happened to Irene in my own body.'

In 2010, there was a surge of 40 per 
cent in the number of women seeking elective Caesareans because they had
experienced trauma during previous births, prompting the NHS to 
introduce special birth trauma units and counselling services as well as
funding research into why this is happening.

'It's vital for the NHS to understand
why so many new mothers are left traumatised,' confirms Dr Susan Wray, 
head researcher at the Centre For Better Births at Liverpool University.
'This affects so many women, their future fertility and their 
psychological well-being.'

Holistic
therapist Natalia O'Sullivan, and co-author of my book The Ancestral 
Continuum, has experienced the phenomenon herself.

Natalia, 49, lives in Somerset with her three children, now aged 14 to 21. She gave birth to her first, Sequoia, at the age of 28.

'I discovered my grandmother had given birth to my mother at 28, and my mother to me at the same age,' Natalia says, 'and my daughter's difficult birth seemed to reflect what my mother and grandmother went through.'

Sequoia was born three weeks prematurely, just as her parents were moving house. Natalia was in labour for 37 hours, and her daughter was so jaundiced she had to be kept in hospital for ten days.

'At the time I felt totally alone and unsupported. I ended up with post-natal depression for six months.'

When she discussed it with her mother, she found she had experienced similar feelings, though for different reasons. 'My mother was in a foreign country, with few friends and no family. Similarly, when my mother was born, my grandfather was in Mexico on a sabbatical and my grandmother felt abandoned and lonely,' she says. 'I think that came through my mother to me.'

Of course, many people will argue that a woman's experience of childbirth is largely down to luck.But there are theories that the chemicals released by the mother during a traumatic birth can fundamentally alter an individual.

Such are the similarities between Roma 
Norriss's own birth and that of her son, that the 29-year-old is 
convinced there is a link.

Roma Norriss experienced a traumatic birth when her son Zephyr, now aged 5, was born

Roma had Zephyr, now five, at home in Bath. During the birth she began to haemorrhage and spent five weeks drifting in and out of a coma after getting an infection.

She says: 'I was born eight weeks premature and was taken away from my own mother for five weeks and put in an incubator. When I had Zephyr, I believe it was my own birth playing out again.'

Fear of giving birth is known as tokophobia

After recovering, Roma began training as a birthing assistant, or doula, and attended many births. So when she became pregnant with daughter Artemis in 2011, she felt confident enough to proceed without consulting a midwife or doctor.

After a short, easy labour, she gave 
birth last September in a birthing pool at home, with just her husband 
and a friend in attendance.

However, when Roma registered the birth,
a social services file  was opened alerting the NHS to what they termed
a 'concealed birth', prompting several visits  to her home by 
suspicious health visitors.Roma later discovered this, too, had a precedent.

For some women childbirth is truly terrifying

She explains: 'I discovered my mother was born in secret. She was the result of an affair that my grandmother had, and although everyone pretended the baby belonged to my grandfather, my grandmother was shunned by society and her husband eventually kicked his wife and her daughter out.'

All the women and childbirth practitioners we interviewed for our book said it was important to explore one's family history around giving birth.

'You can eat well, exercise and organise birth pools,' says Roma. 'But if you do not work on clearing the past, you will experience what happened when you were born and your mother was born and so on.'

Sara Bran recalls how enlightening it was to unravel the mysteries of her own family line. 'I explored all the stories and family myths I had inherited surrounding motherhood and childbirth,' she says.

'I found out about stillborn babies and children born in secret and surrendered for adoption, and women who struggled as I did to enjoy motherhood.

'I began to understand how ideas of birth can be inherited, just as we inherit the colour of an eye or an aptitude for music.'

While
these latter traits can never be changed, there are many who 
desperately hope they can influence their birth experience, whether they
believe it's pre-destined or not.
