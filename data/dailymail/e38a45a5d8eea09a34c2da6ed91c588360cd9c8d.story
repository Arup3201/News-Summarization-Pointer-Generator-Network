A video has emerged of terrifying moment a tornado hit an elementary school in Oklahoma.

As they huddle in a bathroom, teachers can be heard trying to reassure their terrified students as the twister tears up Briarwood Elementary, one of schools hit by Monday's twister.

The clip starts with teacher Robin Dziedzic filming in a pitch black bathroom with her students as they try to seek shelter.

Horrifying: As they huddle in a bathroom, teachers can be heard trying to reassure their terrified students as they twister tears up Briarwood Elementary, one of two Oklahoma City-area schools hit by Monday's twister

Mayhem: The school corridor after being ripped apart by the twister - no-one at the school was killed

Dawning: A classroom which less than an hour before was in pristine condition is now wrecked

The only source of light is from a bulb in the corner of the room.

Mrs Dziedzic, a fifth grade teacher, can be heard trying to reassure the terrified students telling them: 'It's almost over, it's almost over.'

A student cries out 'I hate this' as the 200pmh winds swirl outside the tiny room.

'Keep your heads down,' instructs one of the teachers as the air pushes down on the students.

Carnage: The first site Robin Dziedzic sees after emerging from the pitch black bathroom

Transformation: Dazed students wander the corridor, shocked at the change in the school

Obliterated: As the teachers and students emerge from the school, the full scale of the devastation can be seen

Dazed: Shocked and teary students stand outside the school as the carnage in revealed

Reunited: Mrs Dziedzic finds her son Sam, a first grader, who also attended the school

As the full force of the tornado rips through the school, cries of terror and screams can be heard from the students.

The video, filmed on a cellphone, 
then shows the students emerging from the darkness and seeing for the 
first time the full scale of devastation.

The school corridor is strewn with 
debris, mud and insulator foam and the dazed students can be seen walking around 
the building in horror.

Mrs Dziedzic, evidently in shock, can just be heard repeating 'Oh my god, oh my god.'

Devastated: Robin Dziedzic surveys the scene in shock as she revisits the school

Destruction: Robin Dziedzic walks down the tornado-damaged corridor- the bathroom she sheltered in is behind the wall

Poignant: Robin Dziedzic opens the door to her bathroom which saved the life of her and her students

The footage then cuts to outside the school where the land is completely obliterated.

Terrified students gather in the land outside as Mrs Dziedzic searches for her two children who are also at the school- her son Sam, a first grader and daughter Mairi, a fourth grader.

Sam finds her in the crowd and her husband, who arrives at the scene tracks down Mairi - the pair hug in a sobbing embrace.

ABC News took  Mrs Dziedzic back to revisit the ravaged school for the first time.

She was emotionalÂ  pointed out the 
first grade classroom where her son's teacher lay on top of him to keep 
him and other students safe.

She walked down the corridor- one of 
the only walls still standing in the school - to revisit the bathroom 
which provided shelter for her and the students.

No-one at the school was hurt, although  Mrs Dziedzic is now dealing the agony of losing colleagues and young children at the other elementary school hit by the EF-5 tornado.
