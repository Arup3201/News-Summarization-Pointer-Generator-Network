Most people believe having an older colleague has a positive effect on the workplace, often because they can be good role models or mentors, a new study has shown.

A survey of more than 2,000 adults by the Nationwide building society showed that workers over the age of 55 were less likely to take sick leave or be absent because of a hangover.

Older employees are also keeping up with younger workers by learning how to use new technology, the research found.

Mentor: A new study has shown that most people believe having an older colleague has a positive effect on the workplace because they can be good role models or mentors

Almost half of workers over the age of
 55 had not taken any sick leave in the past year, while most people in 
that age group usually arrived early to work.

Just
 three per cent of those polled believed they would be able to retire at
 55, while almost one in seven feared they would not be able to give up 
work until they were 70.

Alison
 Robb, group director at Nationwide, said: 'As far as Nationwide is 
concerned, employing older workers is a good business decision - they 
tend to be experienced, conscientious and hardworking.

'The decision should always be whether that person can do the job and has the right values.

'Having a diverse workforce which reflects our customer base makes sound commercial sense.'

Around 16 per cent of Nationwide's 17,000 employees are over 50, and two per cent are 60 or older.
