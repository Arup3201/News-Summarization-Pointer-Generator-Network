Frustrated residents in a remote village finally have superfast broadband – after they dug trenches and laid new cables themselves.

Locals in Dolphinholme, Lancashire, had repeatedly asked internet provider BT to wire them up to the new superfast cable, since it took them several minutes to load a single webpage. But BT refused because of the village’s remoteness and the cost.

So volunteers laid new cables themselves to connect the village of around 50 homes to a superfast network, provided by independent firm Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN).

Residents of Dolphinholme, Lancashire (above), repeatedly asked internet provider BT to wire them up to the new superfast cable but took the matter into their own hands when the internet provider refused to help

They now have one of the fastest networks in the UK.

Allen Norris, of the Dolphinholme B4RN Action Group, it was 'life changing' to the village.

He said: ‘It’s no exaggeration to say that having hyper-speed broadband is a life-changing event.

'Previously, we were getting speeds of 
around one megabit meaning it could take six or seven hours to download a
 simple smartphone software update and minutes to load a webpage. Now it takes seconds.

'Daily activities that many people take for granted ... are only now a reality for residents in Dolphinholme.’

Volunteer Liz Collinson said it was tough but they managed to have fun while they were digging the trenches.

She said: 'It's been very, very hard especially in the winter when it was very muddy and you were up to your knees and trying to dig and you couldn't get the mud off your spade.'

Tiny Dolphinholme - two-and-a-half miles
 from the M6 motorway - only boasts one pub, a village hall, two 
chapels, a garage, a tennis court and a bowling green.

B4RN 
Action Group was launched in 2011 when villagers realised they would be 
unlikely to see superfast broadband from the state-funded network, 
managed by Lancashire county council and provided by BT.

Superfast broadband is defined by the European Union as broadband with speeds of 24Mbps (megabits per second) or above.

A survey conducted by insurance firm NFU Mutual in March suggested one in five rural families have poor broadband links and families said it was affecting their children's education.

The first homes, in the hamlet of Quernmore, Lancashire, were connected in 2012 and nearby Arkholme-with-Cawood was next.

Raising its own funding without government help, B4RN enlisted farmers and other local residents to dig its FTTP (fibre to the premises) network, providing 1Gbps broadband, plus phone and TV, to the most remote locations.

By contrast, the BT and council scheme can only deliver up to 76Mbps within a kilometre of its central hub cabinets, and promises only a minimum of 2Mbps in rural areas.

A spokesman for B4RN praised the locals for making the superfast broadband dream for their village happen.

He added: 'The Dolphinholme B4RN Action Group was dedicated to completing this project, which means bringing the service to all those in Dolphinholme who want it.'
