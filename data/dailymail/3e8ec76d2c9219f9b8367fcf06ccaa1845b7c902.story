Seven Metropolitan Police officers were arrested while on one of the men's stag party in Vilnius, Lithuania, after brawling in the street. 

The officers, who have not been named, are under investigation after footage of the incident emerged. 

Photographs of the men alleged to have been involved with bloodied lips and scruffy clothes were published as it was claimed they were forced to spend £1,000 to be let out of jail.

A spokesman for Metropolitan Police said investigations were underway but that it was too early to say whether the men will face disciplinary action. 

Footage obtained by the Sun shows the men being dragged away by Lithuanian authorities outside a nightclub. 

A local prosecutor later told the newspaper he granted them bail so they could return to the UK. 

It is not known whether the men will face charges yet. 

'I personally gave them bail after they paid 5,000 Lithuanian Lita which is about £1,000,' said Marius Zupkauskas. 

'If we decide to charge them they will have to return to Lithuania for a trial.' 

A spokesman for the police force today said the incident was being investigated by the Department for Professional Standards.

'The Directorate of Professional Standards is aware seven police constables from Territorial Policing were arrested on Saturday November 22 whilst on leave in Vilnius, Lithuania.

'Inquiries into what has taken place are ongoing but are at an early stage. The DPS will liaise with Lithuanian authorities.'

The officers have not been suspended, though the situation may change if the men are charged. 

'We will obviously evaluate that decision,' the spokesman added, describing the DPS investigation and foreign authorities' efforts as 'independent' from each other.
