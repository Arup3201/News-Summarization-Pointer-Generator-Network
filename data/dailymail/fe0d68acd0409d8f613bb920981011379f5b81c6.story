TJ Oshie has become an overnight star for helping lead Team USA men's hockey to victory over Team Russia's titans, but the tiny Minnesota town here he grew up has created idols on ice before.

In fact, Warroad, Minnesota--population 1,781--has another hometown hero in Sochi with 3-time Olympic women's hockey star and the 2005 high school prom queen to Oshie's king Gigi Marvin.

And that's just this year. The little village just six frigid miles from the Canadian border has sent a total of seven hockey players to Olympics over the decades, all of whom have won medals except Oshie.

Lonely Warroad, nestled at the banks 
of Minnesota's Muskeg Bay, may very well be a necessary part of every 
Olympic lineup: No U.S. men's team has ever won a gold medal without 
having a Warroad player on its roster.

The tiny town is filled with tributes to 
Oshie and Martin. Store windows are plastered with posters wishing the 
Olympians good luck, and huge U.S. flags hang everywhere.

There's a long history of hockey 
greatness in this rural outpost, where the cold winters make for perfect
 ice-skating conditions.

'From
 the time kids are tiny their parents have them in skates,' said Marnie 
Swedberg, who owns a retail store in town. 'From the time they're 2 or 
3, they've got them in the rink.'

Marvin,
 whose grandfather Cal Marvin coached the U.S. men's team in the 1960s, 
won silver four years ago in Vancouver. And Henry Boucha, an Ojibwa 
Indian, won silver with the U.S. team in 1972.

Then
 there are the Christians. Dave Christian played on the Miracle on Ice 
team that beat the Soviet Union in 1980 en route to winning the gold 
medal. His father, Bill Christian, and uncle, Roger Christian, helped 
the U.S. win gold at the 1960 games and played in the 1964 games in 
Innsbruck, Austria.

Another uncle, Gord Christian, took silver in 1956.

Well before the 1980 games, the Christian family founded the Christian Brothers Hockey Stick company in Warroad and, according to Slate, sales soared following the Miracle on Ice victory against the Soviet team.

According to legend, the hockey tradition in Warroad dates back to the days before the Winter Olympics even existed. And not surprising, to a relative of Marvin's.

The New York Times reports that, at the Warroad Museum, a preserved anecdote traces the town's hockey obsession at least to 1907, when Gigi's great grandfather stepped off a train from Manitoba and was immediately asked, 'Do you play hockey?'

'I
 think it's pretty amazing that we're such a small town and we get such 
big opportunities,' said Sarah Casperson, 16, a sophomore at Warroad 
High School. 'People here are so talented.'

Casperson joked that children in Warroad, which bills itself as Hockeytown USA, learn to skate before they can walk. But there is some truth to it.

Hockey dynasty: Marvin's grandfather coached the 1960s men's Olympic team and her great grandfather is part of a Warroad legend in which he stepped from a train from Manitoba in 1907 and was immediately asked by a native, 'Do you play hockey?'

Whether
 Oshie can duplicate his predecessors' success remains to be seen, 
though his four shootout goals on six attempts at the end of Saturday's 
preliminary round game have put him in the spotlight.

University
 of North Dakota hockey coach Dave Hakstol, for whom Oshie played for 
three years, remembered his protege as an intense competitor who had a 
knack for rising to the occasion.

The bigger the stage, the better Oshie plays, Hakstol said.

'I don't think anybody's surprised by what he did today,' Hakstol said. 'You saw he had a little grin on his face before he took each shootout. That's just him out there having fun and competing.'

Oshie
 has said he tries to be unpredictable with his shot selections in 
high-pressure situations, and he leads the NHL with seven shootout goals
 in 10 tries this season.

While Oshie might not be a household name, hockey fans respect him as one of the best, his former coach said.

'Today he introduced himself to the world,' Hakstol said. 'I
 think his personality will really endear people to him. He's such a 
humble, fun-loving guy. And then when he gets on the ice he competes as 
hard â€” or harder â€” than anybody out there.'

After Saturday's win, Oshie addressed the expectations of his fans back home.

'I'm definitely going to try to represent the town and obviously the country as best I can,' Oshie said. 'There's some big shoes to fill in there so I'll just try to do my part.
