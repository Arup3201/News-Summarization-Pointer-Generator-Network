Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid have enjoyed an astounding year, following up  Champions League glory by winning sixteen straight games this season to set a new club record.

That  victory in May, a 4-1 triumph against fierce rivals Atletico Madrid after extra-time, went down in folklore as 'La Decima' as it was their tenth European title.

The players were rewarded financially for the feat with a handsome sum of 500,000 euros  (£392,000) each, but that is not where the generosity has stopped from the club, according to Marca.

The Panerai Radiomir watch is worth around £24,000 and has been given to Real Madrid's players

Real have handed each player a watch to commemorate the achievement, the Panerai Radiomir GMT Oro Rosso. 

The watch is worth around £24,000 and has a strap made out of alligator skin.

It is undoubtedly another extremely generous gesture from the club, although they must be slightly concerned at how they can surpass it if Ancelotti's side continue their relentless winning streak.
