Cristiano Ronaldo became the joint third highest scorer in Real Madrid’s history on Sunday night with his 290th goal for the club in a 2-0 win over Elche.

The victory put Real four points clear of Barcelona who slipped up 24 hours earlier against Malaga and it also moved Ronaldo up another notch on Madrid’s all-time goals list.

Across almost two decades Spain international striker Santillana scored 290 goals in 645 games from his debut in 1971.

Carlo Ancelotti took charge of his 100th competitive match of Real Madrid in the 2-0 win against Elche

Elche (4-4-1-1): Tyton; Suarez, Roco, Lomban, Edu Albacar; Rodriguez, Adrian ( Herrera 81), Pasalic (Galvez 75), Niguez (Mendes Rodrigues 64) ; Fajr; Jonathas.

Subs not used: Herrera Yague, Cisma, Corominas, Gimenez Candela.

Real Madrid (4-3-3): Casillas; Carvajal, Pepe, Varane, Marcelo; Lucas Silva (Illarramendi 84), Kroos, Isco (Arbeloa 89); Bale, Benzema (Jese 93), Ronaldo.

Subs not used: Navas, Hernandez, Nacho, Medran

Scorers: Benzema 56, Ronaldo 69

It has taken Ronaldo just 281 games to match that total and he is now only 15 goals from second placed top scorer Alfredo Di Stefano and 33 behind all-time leader Raul. 

All that after coming into the game on a run of three league games without a goal – he has never gone four matches without scoring since joining the club and that record stays in tact.

He had four chances inside the first 20 minutes. He almost scored after just five minutes when from Karim Benzema’s pass he hit the Elche bar. He then had a shot from the edge of the area that Przemysław Tyton saved.

That was followed by a long crossfield pass from Marcelo which he pulled back across the face of the goal instead of sending goalwards. And then on 19 minutes came the best chance of the half.

Gareth Bale crossed from the right and inexplicably Ronaldo directed his effort back away from goal. On another day he would have had a first half hat-trick.

The last opportunity of the four owed everything to Bale, so much for the selfish former Spurs forward. He was causing Elche problems down their left and Edu Albacar was booked for upending him.

Benzema went one better than Ronaldo shortly before the break when he did put the ball in the net but the linesman’s flag cruelly ruled it out. Bale was again the architect crossing from the right. 

Benzema connected brilliantly with an overhead kick that gave Tyton no chance but despite appearing to be level with the last defender he was penalised for offside.

With Real Madrid unable to get themselves in front having dominated the first half Elche came out with plenty of self-belief for the second period. Iker Casillas – making his 500th La Liga appearance for Real Madrid – palmed away Aaron Niguez’s shot.

The midfielder’s next contribution to the game should have been his last. He went through Bale with a red card challenge on the Welshman’s ankle that merited far more than the yellow card he was shown. Both feet were off the ground, the studs were up and Bale was lucky to be able to carry on.

With the referee letting off Niguez and Benzema’s brilliance denied its reward in the first half it seemed the luck was against Real Madrid but on minute 56 thing fell the way of Ancelotti’s team at last.

Raul (1994-2010) 323 goals 741 appearances

Alfredo Di Stefano (1953-1964) 305 goals 392 appearances 

Cristiano Ronaldo (2009-present) 290 goals 281 appearances 

Carlos Santillana (1971-1988) 289 goals 645 appearances 

Ferenc Puskas (1958-1966) 242 goals 262 appearances

Ronaldo’s cross was intercepted by former Barca B defender David Lomban but he cleared it straight at keeper Tyton and it run into the path of Benzema who swept it over the line from close range. It was no more than he and Madrid deserved.

The goal relaxed Real Madrid but not Ronaldo who missed another chance this time from a Bale pass. Could he really go four league games without a goal? He answered the question emphatically on 69 minutes to put the game beyond doubt.

Isco ran on to Marcelo’s pass and skipped past Damian Suarez before planting a cross on Ronaldo’s head. There was still work for Real Madrid’s top scorer to do but with a bullet header he gave Tyton no chance. He might have scored a second a minute later but was wrestled to the ground by Enzo Roco who also escaped with a yellow card. 

Elche somehow had finished with 11 men on the pitch but had been beaten none the less. Ancelotti once said that having Ronaldo on the pitch was like starting one goal in front. The Italian coach had picked up three points on his 100th game in charge of Real Madrid, his record breaking striker had made sure of it.
