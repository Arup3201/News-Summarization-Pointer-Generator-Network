While style chameleons such as Rihanna and Miley Cyrus constantly change their look, it seems that for the rest of us, staying true to old favourites trumps freshening up our appearance.

According to a new survey, just like the Duchess of Cambridge, more than two thirds of us admit to eschewing trends in favour of sticking to a style that suits.

And it isn't just fashion trends that we're avoiding. More than 56 per cent of women admit to leaving their make-up unchanged over the last five years while 65 per cent say they haven’t changed their hairstyle either.

Spot the difference: The Duchess of Cambridge has stayed true to her style and rarely rings the changes

Younger women are more likely to adopt radical changes to their look, with the survey pointing out that most of us don't feel comfortable with our signature style until the age of 42.

Nevertheless, more than a third of women admitted to having had the same dress sense, colour and make-up as they did a decade ago. 

There are also regional differences, with Northern Irish ladies proving to be the most daring about changing their hairstyle, with 57 per cent following Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Lawrence's lead and rocking a short crop, while those who live in the East Midlands are fans of a perm.

Londoners like to keep it simple with 73 per cent opting for a long and straight hairstyle, championed by Gwyneth Paltrow among others.

Londoners are also the most confident about their personal style and don’t follow celebrity trends - unlike those from the north.

And if you're thinking of going for the chop, you might want to reconsider after the survey revealed that 60 per cent of women regret cutting off their long hair, with another 40 per cent regretting a drastic change of colour.

Brunette topped the 'hair-o-meter' as the favourite hue for hair with over 40 per cent preferring a darker shade, perhaps as a result of the Duchess of Cambridge effect.

Tom
Newbald, a spokesman for Feelunique.com, which carried out the survey, said: 
'It’s no surprise that women prefer to stick to a style that suits them 
but it’s extremely interesting to see how often they change their look 
or style.

'Every woman, whether 20 years old or 60 years old will have their own unique style and individuality.'
