Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from a weekend of incredible FA Cup shocks, as well as intriguing matches in the Football League.

1. Andy Carroll’s heading ability makes him feared as a striker, and he was crucial in setting up Diafra Sakho’s winning goal at Bristol City.

But the giant England forward is just as important to West Ham for his defensive work.

The goal line clearance that stopped Matt Smith putting Bristol City in front was one of 12 headers that Carroll won out of 19 he contested in the FA Cup tie.

More than half of those were in Hammers’ own penalty box helping deal with corners and free kicks, rather than when the team were attacking.

2. Louis van Gaal was still at the World Cup with Holland and yet to take over at Old Trafford when Manchester United paid £30million for Ander Herrera and it’s beginning to look as if he was a player the Dutchman didn’t really want.

The 25-year-old Spaniard got on for only the last 23 minutes of the 0-0 at League Two Cambridge and that’s typical of how rarely he has figured for van Gaal.

He has had injuries – but even when fit all but two of his last nine appearances in a United shirt have been as a substitute.

3. One of the reasons van Gaal is said to be willing to let Herrera move on is that he wants more pace in wide areas – so he’ll be pleased to note the sudden progress being made by Wilfried Zaha since Alan Pardew took over at Crystal Palace.

The 22-year-old, loaned out for the season by United but never a regular when Neil Warnock was in charge, has started three of the four games under Pardew.

It’s clearly helping his confidence, involved in the creation of all three goals in the FA Cup win at Southampton.

4. If Jordan Henderson is really going to step up as the Anfield successor to Steven Gerrard he needs to add more regular goal scoring to his repertoire.

There were other players who were more guilty of missing chances in the 0-0 draw with Bolton, but 24-year-old Henderson had two good openings and failed to convert them in the way Gerrard in his prime would have led the side.

Henderson has just two goals in all competitions from 31 appearances this season, after hitting five in 39 last term.

5. There’s been much talk of how Chelsea need to keep Diega Costa and Nemanja Matic fit for their assault on multiple silverware but it is John Terry who remains the real heartbeat of the side.

At 34 the Blues skipper sat out of the FA Cup clash with Bradford for a rest – only the fifth of Chelsea’s 34 matches so far this season he’s not figured in.

But it’s hard to imagine Jose Mourinho’s side would have fallen apart so badly against League One opposition of their Captain, Leader, Legend had been on the pitch.

6. Former England Under 21 defender Craig Dawson started the season as first choice partner for Joleon Lescott at West Brom but lost his place in early December.

The 24-year-old who began life playing part-time football while working in a pub collecting glasses is clearly determined to show new boss Tony Pulis he should get another chance.

He was Albion’s best defender at Birmingham, making 14 clearances as his team fought off a second half onslaught from their Championship neighbours to hang on to a 2-1 win.

7. Winger Marc Albrighton could finally be about to get a proper chance to force his way into Leicester’s team after a disappointing time since moving from Aston Villa in search of regular first team football.

The 25-year-old has started only two games all season – ironically one of them being the 1-0 win t’s against Villa.

But his 17 minute cameo at Tottenham was crucial to the comeback mounted by Nigel Pearson’s side, involved in the build-up to the equaliser and then hitting the cross for Jeffrey Schlupp’s dramatic injury time winner.

8. Nigel Clough had a huge reputation for bringing through young players at Derby and he’s doing the same thing at Sheffield United.

The Blades boss made eight changes at Preston from the side which had performed so heroically at Spurs a few days earlier in the Capital One Cup.

Curiously one of the three whose legs were felt fresh enough for two big cup ties just three days apart was 17-year-old Louis Reed.

Already the youngest ever to play for United when he made his debut at 16 and 257 days, the midfielder easily got through 90 minutes as his side fought back from a goal down to earn a replay.

9. Caretaker Steve Lovell is doing his chances of landing the job at Gillingham permanently after seeing his side beat Oldham to score back-to-back home League wins for the first time since last March.

Gills chairman Paul Scally is still searching for a boss after Neil Ardley and his number two Neil Cox chose to stay at AFC Wimbledon.

That’s given an extended chance to 54-year-old Lovell, who played 233 games as a striker for the Gills in the late 1980s and has made it clear he wants to stay in charge.

10. Chris Wilder performed miracles to rescue Northampton from relegation last season and is beginning to drive them on again this term.

Wilder has brought in three new players on loan in January to revamp his side, and the 3-0 over promotion chasing Newport was his side’s third win in a row. It leaves them just seven points from the play-offs.
