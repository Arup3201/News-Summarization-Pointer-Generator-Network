Spain boss Vicente del Bosque has left the door open for the return of David Villa to the national team despite the striker stepping down following the side's dismal exit from the World Cup.

The former Barcelona ace, now New York City's marquee star in the MLS, said that his games in Brazil would be his last for Spain but the 97-cap veteran could yet lead the line again under Del Bosque. 

Del Bosque told Spanish radio that there is no reason Villa, 33, couldn't reach 100 caps because he had 'done so much for the national team' and has kept the door open for him to return.

Spain coach Vincente del Bosque says Villa doesn't have to have played his last international games

'There are exceptional cases and one of those is David,' said Del Bosque of the player who was instrumental in Spain's triumphs at Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup.

Nevertheless he isn't with the Spain squad for Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Ukraine and their friendly in the Netherlands four days later with Juventus's Alvaro Morata and Malaga's Juanmi, who is yet to receive his first cap, the only strikers at Del Bosque's disposal.

Villa has 59 goals in his 97 appearances for the full national team, but managed just one in their disappointing departure in the group stage of the World Cup in Brazil - the opener in Spain's 3-0 win in their dead rubber against Australia. 

Villa's goals and influence were instrumental in Spain's Euro 2008 and 2010 World Cup victories 

Del Bosque, at a sponsors announcement on Tuesday, said Villa was an 'exceptional case'' for Spain

He's impressed in his opening matches as captain for New York City, for which he was the club's first-ever signing. 

He went into the history books in their second game by becoming the scorer of their first home goal at Yankees Stadium with his 19th-minute strike in their 2-0 win over New England Revolution.
