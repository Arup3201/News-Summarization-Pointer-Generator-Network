A United Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., made a quick emergency landing at another Southern California airport Thursday morning after passengers reported a burning smell on board.

Several passengers have claimed on social media that there was a fire on the plane.

United Flight 1181 from Los Angeles International Airport to Dulles International Airport landed safely at Ontario International Airport, about 40 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, just before 9am.

There were no reports of injuries among the 199 passengers and seven crew members, United spokeswoman Mary Ryan said.

Response; Fire crews on the tarmac sprayed down the Boeing 757's brakes; with a full tank of fuel for a cross-country haul, the plane was heavy and the brakes hot

About half an hour into the flight the pilot declared an emergency, and within about five minutes the plane was on the ground, according to Harold Johnson, an Ontario airport spokesman 

Passenger Mitchell Hashimoto tweeted about the incident. Some of his tweets were deleted but preserved by NBC Los Angeles.

'Airplane caught on fire mid flight,' one of them read. 'Emergency landed from cruising altitude to ground in 5 minutes. Not comfortable.'

'25,000 feet to 0 in 5 minutes,' another said. 'A roller coaster!'

KABC preserved Hashimoto's tweet that 'They can't deplane us until the fire is out, it's not in the cabin. Cabin has smoke in it though. It was smoky mid-flight. Again, not fun.'

In one tweet that is still up, however, Hashimoto wrote 'But also, our pilot handled that situation super fast and professionally. High five.' 

Twitter user @toddpalmerton wrote 'We just made an emergency landing in Ontario CA. @united flight 1181 was smoking in the cabin and cock pit. We are safe but shaken up.'

In an Instagram post showing people exiting the plane, he said 'We had to make an emergency landing in Ontario CA today after we smelled smoke and they discovered a small fire in the fuselage. 

'Our pilot was incredible, but it's pretty nerve racking having to text your wife that you love her while the pilot flys a 777 like its a navy fighter jet. #safe #thankful #unitedairlines #emergencylanding'

Instagram user Elizabeth Roessler also uploaded a photo of fire crews on the scene, writing 'First flight on fire; thankful to be back on the ground!'

'They put the pedal to the metal and got us here pretty quickly,' said passenger Jim Clarke. 'It was a quick landing.' 

The atmosphere on the plane was calm, as was the evacuation, Clarke said.

Fire crews on the tarmac sprayed down the Boeing 757's brakes; with a full tank of fuel for a cross-country haul, the plane was heavy and the brakes hot.

A maintenance crew was checking the aircraft, and the airline was working to reroute passengers to Washington, Ryan said.
