The only surviving German Dornier Do-17 bomber has arrived at an RAF museum for a restoration project after spending more than 70 years at the bottom of the English Channel.

The badly-damaged Second World War aircraft was transported more than 200 miles from Ramsgate to RAF Cosford in Shropshire today, escorted by two low loader lorries.

It was lifted from the seabed on the Kent coastline last week where it was shot down during the Battle of Britain.

The painstaking project is believed to be the biggest ever recovery of its kind in British waters.

The aircraft will be kept in purpose-built hydration tunnels at RAF Cosford, where it will stay for the first stage of its conservation.

Alex Medhurst, general manager at RAF Museum Cosford, told the BBC: 'After all the hard work, planning and setbacks, it's great to know the Dornier is finally here at Cosford.

'It will be a rare and exciting opportunity for visitors to get up close and personal to a unique piece of aviation history and the chance to view it in its salvaged state.'

Conservationist Laura Pringle started work immediately hosing down the bomber as museum staff were thrilled to see the plane finally arrive

The plan to raise the plane - three years in the making - involved attaching lifting equipment to the strongest parts of the aircraft's frame and raising it whole in a single lift on June 10.

The ambitious hour-long operation was endlessly delayed by strong winds for weeks on end, until finally good weather made the salvage possible.

The existence of the aircraft at Goodwin Sands became known when it was spotted by casual divers in 2008 at a depth of 50ft, lying on a chalk bed surrounded by debris.

Sonar scans by the RAF Museum, Wessex Archaeology and the Port of London Authority confirmed the identity of the aircraft.

Judging by the serial number on the aircraft it was shot down on August 26, 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain.

It was nicknamed the Luftwaffe's 'flying pencil' because of its narrow fuselage.

Around 1,500 models of the aircraft were built, but this one is the last remaining.

Originally it would have been camouflaged green and dark green on top with swastikas outlined in white on both rudders.

The Dornier's bombs devastated large areas of London, Coventry and Norwich as one of the Luftwaffe's most important assets in the early phase of World War Two.

Historians believe this particular plane took off on the morning of August 26, with eight other Dornier bombers from St Trond in German-occupied Belgium to bomb the RAF fighter base Manston in Kent.

The Luftwaffe lost three of its Dorniers that day, including this one.

After an attempted controlled landing, the plane somersaulted and landed on its back.

All four crew managed to leave the aircraft.

Wireless operator Helmut Reinhardt 
and Bomb Aimer Heinz Huhn died and their bodies were washed up in 
Holland and England, repectively where they were buried in war 
cemeteries.

The other two crew members, Pilot 
Willi Effmert and  Bomb Aimer Hermann Ritzel survived and spent the rest
of the war in British prisoner-of-war camps.

Experts are excited by the find because, apart from the effects of sea life - such as barnacles, coral and marine life, it is largely intact.

Amazingly the main undercarriage tyres remain inflated, although the propellers clearly show the damage inflicted during the bomber's fateful final landing.

Once the delicate process of conservation is complete, the aircraft will be displayed at the museum's London site within the context of the Battle of Britain story.
