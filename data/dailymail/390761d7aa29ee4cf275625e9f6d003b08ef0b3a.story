For nearly a decade, the Cassini spacecraft has pulled back the misty veil that obscures Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

Its radar has revealed half of the giant moon's surface, highlighting desert-like expanses of sand dunes and vast hydrocarbon seas.

Now, using a new technique for cleaning up Cassini's radar images, these views have taken been transformed into high-definition images of its stunning features.

The technique, referred to by its developers as 'despeckling,' produces images of Titan's surface that are much clearer.

With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere.

Titan is of interest to scientists because it is one of the most Earth-like worlds found to date.

But trying to analyse its surface has been tricky for scientists because typically, Cassini's radar images have a characteristic grainy appearance.

This montage of Cassini images of the surface of Titan shows examples of how a newly developed technique for handling noise results in clearer views. The top row of images was produced with the method used since the mission arrived atSaturn a decade ago; the row at bottom was produced using the new technique

A conceptual design of Nasa's submarine that could be heading for Titan in 2040

If sending rovers to Mars wasn't enough, Nasa now wants to send submarines to Titan. The space agency has outlined plans to launch the huge structure to Saturn's largest moon by 2040.

Nasa's conceptual Titan submarine would weigh about one tonne (2,200 lb), and would use conventional electric propulsion over a 90-day mission.

Nasa says it plans to send the submarine to Titan using a winged spacecraft similar to US Air Force X-37. The craft would survive hypersonic entry into moon' atmosphere, release the submarine, while its sinks to the bottom of the alien ocean.

Titan's atmosphere is largely made up of nitrogen and methane at a pressure one and half times that of Earth's, and with a temperature of -290 °F (-179 °C).

Nasa said the submarine would be driven by a 1kW radiothermal Stirling generator that would propel the craft and also prevent it from freezing. Overall, it be able to travel at one metre per second (3.6 km/h, 2.2 mph).

This 'speckle noise' can make it difficult to interpret small-scale features or identify changes in images of the same area taken at different times.

Despeckling uses an algorithm to remove the noise, resulting in clearer views that can be easier for researchers to interpret.

'Noise in the images gave me headaches,' Antoine Lucas, who works at the astrophysics division of France's nuclear center.

Lucas found that a team near Paris was working on a 'de-noising' algorithm, and he began working with them to adapt their model to the Cassini radar data.

'My headaches were gone, and more importantly, we were able to go further in our understanding of Titan's surface using the new technique,' Lucas said.

Lucas and colleagues have shown that they can produce 3-D maps, called digital elevation maps, of Titan's surface with greatly improved quality.

With clearer views of river channels, lake shorelines and windswept dunes, researchers are also able to perform more precise analyses of processes shaping Titan's surface.

And Lucas suspects that the speckle noise itself, when analysed separately, may hold information about properties of the surface and subsurface.

'This new technique provides a fresh look at the data, which helps us better understand the original images,' said Stephen Wall, deputy team lead of Cassini's radar team.

With this innovative new tool, we will look for details that help us to distinguish among the different processes that shape Titan's surface,' he said.
