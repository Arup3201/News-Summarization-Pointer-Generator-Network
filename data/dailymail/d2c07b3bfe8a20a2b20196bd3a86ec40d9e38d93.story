Hot stuff: The Naga Chilli Vodka packs 250,000 Scovilles

Vodka fans with an adventurous side can add a bit of spice to their lives as Master of Malt launches the world’s hottest chilli vodka.

At 250,000 on the Scoville scale, the new Naga Chilli Vodka is so hot it comes with a special health warning.

Its launch comes just months after the company released the 100,000 Scovilles Naga Chilli Vodka.

The new version is 2.5 times hotter.

The chilli used in the vodka is the Naga Jolokia, which is known to be one of the hottest chillis it is possible to grow, and rates higher on the Scoville scale than most law-enforcement grade pepper sprays.

Each Scoville unit denotes how many times the chilli must be diluted by its own mass of water until the heat is only just detectable.

A Jalapeno has an estimated 5,000 Scovilles. The Naga Jolokia can exceed 1,000,000 Scovilles.

The drink is made by fermenting litres
 of vodka with 18kg of the fiery peppers.

The potent chillis are infused in large 
vodka-filled carboys for many weeks before bottling, and the bottlers must wear 
gas masks and rubber gloves when handling the chillis and final vodka to
 protect their skin, eyes, noses, and lungs.

The resulting concoction is 
left for several weeks to infuse, and once the vodka has turned a dark caramel colour, the infusion is complete and the vodka can be bottled.

The drink is recommended as a mixer, with expert mixologists suggesting it can be used in a classic Bloody Mary for a drink with extra kick.

Dangerous: The Naga Jolokia chilli is fiercely hot and can be hazardous if ingested raw or unprocessed

The 250,000 Scovilles - Naga Chilli Vodka will be available from 2 October at www.masterofmalt.com and costs £31.95 for 50cl.

'I was blasé when the small, sinister-looking bottle of Naga Chilli vodka landed on my desk. Sure, it was made of the formidable Naga chilli - known to be one of the world’s hottest – and it promised to pack a palate-scorching 250,000 Scovilles  - but I didn’t believe it could pose too much of a problem.

'i love hot stuff – I lived in Jalapa, the Mexican birthplace of the Jalapeno chilli, in my twenties and thought I’d battle-hardened my palate against scorching hot peppers with 14 months of regular chilli-chomping.

'I am as addicted to a regular hit of capsaicin as others are to nicotine, and I have eaten enough limp chilli sauces claiming to be straight out of Satan’s you-know-what that have not raised as much as a tingle that I take marketing spin with a very large pinch of salt.

'This time though, the product met up to its promise. One capful of the stuff had my eyes bulging out of my head. My gums were on fire, my tongue felt like it had been stung by a thousand ants and my lips felt like they’d doubled in size... I loved it.

'Rest assured, this initial pain doesn’t last long. Five minutes later the fierce sting subsided and I was left with nothing more than that pleasant warm tingle that had me reaching for a second hit.'
