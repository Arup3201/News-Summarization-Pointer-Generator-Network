Carol Coronado, 30, was found in bed with the bloody bodies of her children, aged three, two and two months old, on Tuesday evening near Torrance in Los Angeles County, according to police.

Police said that she was naked and holding a knife after reportedly trying to cut her own wrists.

Detectives said on Wednesday that there were several knives recovered at a bloody scene.

Detectives found a horrific scene of the three little girls laying in pools of blood in bed on Tuesday

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were called to an unincorporated area shortly after 5pm on Tuesday, the Sheriff's Department said.

'When they arrived, they were met by family members who told the deputies that a mother had killed her children,' the statement said.

Inside the home, detectives found a horrific scene of three young girls laying dead in a pool of blood on the family bed. The children were pronounced dead at the scene.

'The deputies were directed to the house by the grandmother,' sheriff's homicide Lt. Dave Coleman told the Daily Breeze of Torrance. 'We did find the babies inside the residence.'

Neighbor Ashley Madrid told the Daily Breeze that the children's father, who according to public records is Rodolfo Coronado, was working on his car across the street when his mother-in-law discovered her daughter and the three children in a pool of blood on a bed.

'I saw when they were bringing him out,' Ms Madrid said. 'He was crying. He was crying, ''She killed my daughters!'"

Madrid said she was told the mother had a kitchen knife in her hand and was trying to cut her wrists.

Sheriff's deputies took the mother, who was naked except for a blanket, to a patrol car and she was then placed in an ambulance, Madrid said.

'She was full of blood on her face and arms,' Madrid said

Ms Madrid said the children's grandmother told her that the woman had called earlier in the day and said that she was going crazy. The grandmother had stopped by to visit her grandchildren.

Carol Coronado, 30, was arrested on suspicion of murder, taken to a hospital for examination and then to a sheriff's station for booking. Authorities say she made no statement.

Her 
Facebook page was filled with pictures of the baby girls. The main 
background picture on her page is a composite of her two eldest girls 
and an ultrasound image of her youngest daughter.

Police have not commented on any possible motive for the murders.
