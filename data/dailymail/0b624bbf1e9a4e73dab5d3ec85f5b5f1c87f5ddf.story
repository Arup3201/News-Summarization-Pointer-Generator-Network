This chilled out brown bear looks like he has all the necessities of life, as he relaxes in the river with a tasty, freshly-caught salmon.

The beast looks rather like he is sitting back in a swimming pool with an ice cream cone - and he deserves his rest after a hard day of competing with others for the best fishing spots.

The hungry bears waited at Brook Falls in the Katmai National Park, Alaska, as the salmon made their way up the river.

But there were violent clashes as the giant animals all looked to secure the best spots for themselves - resulting in some incredible photographs.

As the fish try to jump from the water the bears attempt to pluck them out of the air with their jaws or grab hold of their slippery skin with their paws.

They waste no time gobbling them down when they succeed, remaining in the water to eat before getting back to work.

The photos were taken by Brice Petit, a 32-year-old from Geneva, Switzerland, who has spent years photographing brown bears in Finland and polar bears in Spitzberg, but had never been to Alaska - home of around 30,000 grizzlies - before.

He said: 'Large dominant males do not leave their favourite places without a real confrontation which the younger would be wrong to try. Depending on the bears, size, age, weight there are several fishing techniques.

'Some wait patiently at the foot of the fall until the salmon runs between their legs, a simple technique and effective that requires minimal effort.

Vicious fight: Two bears clash amid tumultuous white waters as they both seek the best spot for catching the delicious salmon

'Others stand at the top of the fall and catch salmon in flight with open jaws and legs ready to strike as the first fish passes.

'What is also surprising is the delicacy with which the bears eat their salmon.

'They always begin by removing the skin - which they eat - but with their jaws and legs it seems impossible to do so accurately.

'It is very likely that with a chef's knife I could not do as well in my kitchen.' 

Setting the scene: There are around 30,000 brown bears in Alaska. This was the first time the photographer had travelled to the state to photograph them
