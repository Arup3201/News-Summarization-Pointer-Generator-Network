U.S. Special Forces were complicit in the murder, torture and abuse of at least 18 Afghan villagers and should be investigated, according to human rights advocates.

Human Rights Watch has called on the U.S. government to probe new allegations that military personnel 'participated in or were otherwise responsible for' the killings in Nerkh district, Wardak province, in late 2012 and early 2013.

While an Afghan interpreter working for the U.S. unit was arrested in July over the murders, the victims' families claim U.S. forces knew about the killings and did nothing to stop them.

Allegations of killings in Nerkh first emerged in November 2012.

Local residents claimed the murders were connected to operations by a new U.S. Special Forces unit in the Wardak district, known as ODA 3124.

These U.S. Army Green Berets were trained to wage unconventional warfare, according to Rolling Stone, replacing big Army units in Afghanistan 'to hunt the enemy and stiffen the resolve of government forces'.

Wardak villagers claimed members of ODA 3124 worked with locals on the American payroll to quietly abduct local men and boys and interrogate them in secret.

In February, the body of a man named Nasratullah was found in Nerkh with his throat slit. His family said that he had been arrested by U.S. forces.

The shocking discovery sparked fierce protests in Wardak, with Afghan President Hamid Karzai ordering U.S. forces to leave the province.

After the team withdrew from Nerkh in April, a shepherd found human remains near the team’s former base perimeter.

Villagers began digging in the area and over the next two months, the bodies of 10 Afghan men who had earlier been taken into custody by U.S. forces were found.

According to Afghan government documents, at least eight other men had been killed in operations linked to ODA 3124 – a total of 18 deaths.

In July, Afghan officials arrested local translator Zikria Kandahari who was working with the U.S. unit over the murders.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Kandahari said he did not commit any abuses and that ODA 3124 was responsible for the alleged tortures and murders.

U.S. officials have denied any involvement, despite opening a criminal investigation in July after the International Committee of the Red Cross brought forth new evidence.

Meanwhile, witnesses and the families of the 10 men whose bodies were found have told the United Nations, Afghan officials and journalists from Rolling Stone that Kandahari did not act alone.

In one case, a man detained by U.S. forces said he witnessed Kandahari execute his neighbor, a man named Gul Rahim, in front of U.S. personnel, who did nothing to stop him and did not object afterward.

The man also said that American troops and Kandahari beat him severely, according to Human Rights Watch.

Rolling Stone reported human remains were found in six different sites around the former U.S. base.

The first corpse, identified as Sayed Mohammad, was found in an irrigation ditch by farmers.

Other remains had been scavenged by wild dogs in the area, while others showed traces of burning.

Even if Afghan personnel are found to have carried out the killings and mistreatment, U.S. personnel can bear criminal responsibility for war crimes.

They are responsible if they aided and abetted, ordered, or knew or should have known 
about crimes committed by their subordinates and took no action, according to Human Rights Watch.

'Simply blaming one Afghan interpreter for 18 deaths discredits the U.S. 
commitment to get at the truth,' a spokesman said.

'The U.S. investigation 
should go beyond the people who carried out the killings and examine who
may have assisted in the crimes or failed to take action to stop it.'
