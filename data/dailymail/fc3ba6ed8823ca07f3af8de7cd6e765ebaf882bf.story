First Lady Michelle Obama has given a 
subtle nod of support to Hillary Clinton as speculation mounts over the 
possibility of the country's first female president.

Mrs Obama stated the U.S. should elect a female president as soon as possible, but also ruled herself out of contention for a seat in the Oval Office.

Mrs Clinton has yet to announce whether she will make a bid for the 2016 presidency but has received wide backing from the Democrats amid growing speculation she will announce her intention to run.

Michelle Obama suggested during the Summit on Working Families the U.S. public have an option to vote in the country's first female president in 2016, in a subtle public show of support for Hillary Clinton  

According to a C-SPAN3 video, Mrs Obama made the comments during the Summit on Working Families conference in Washington, Mediaite reported.

Asked when it will be time for the country to elect its first female president, she responded: 'That should happen as soon as possible.

'I
 think this country is ready. This country is ready for anyone who can 
do the job,' she said, adding: 'And I think we have some options, don’t 
we?'

Mrs Clinton's experience would make her a viable candidate for the role with a long history in politics alongside her husband, former president Bill Clinton.

As Secretary of State during the first Obama administration she helped deal with issues such as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the global financial crisis, the Arab Spring revolution and the assassination of Osama Bin Laden.

She was also a long-serving Senator for the State of New York.

Mrs Clinton has been busy recently tending to publicity duties across the country to promote the release of her new book 'Hard Choices'.

However, it hasn't been all smooth sailing, with Mrs Clinton triggering a row with over a claim to the Guardian at the weekend that Americans would not see her personal wealth as an issue because her family paid 'ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off'.

The Clintons are the wealthiest living 
family to leave the White House, and Mrs Clinton is said to charge 
$200,000 for paid speaking fixtures.

Clinton, pictured with a young fan during a book signing in Denver yesterday, has claimed her wealth would not be an issue for the American voters if she were to run for presidency in 2016

The Clinton family are believed to be the wealthiest family to ever leave the White House, with both Bill, left, and Hillary, right, commanding huge fees for public speaking duties, while their daughter Chelsea has just signed a lucrative reporting contract with a U.S. TV network
