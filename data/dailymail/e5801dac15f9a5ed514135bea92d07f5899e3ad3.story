They say opposites attract and that's certainly the case for 3ft 11in Kat Hoffman, whose husband-to-be is almost double her height.

The 26-year-old from Bellefontaine, Ohio, who earns more than $1,000 a week as a stripper, met 6ft Eich Buscher last year through a friend and they hit it off instantly.

'Our personalities clicked . . . I always go for tall men, I love the size difference,' Kat mused.

Busher, 35, says their difference in appearance 'does pose some problems' but nothing too big that they can't handle. 'Obviously she walks slower,' he joked.

The wrestling enthusiast who is a soldier in the U.S. army has a full body tattoo from his neck to his ankles so is used to getting 'strange looks' in public.

He continued: 'This whole world is filled with different kinds of types of people and you have to realise that some people will not accept you for who you are.

'You just ignore those people.'

Busher's fiancee was born with diastrophic dysplasia dwarfism which means her arms, legs and torso are shorter than average and weighs just 61lbs.

Growing up she faced abuse for her size but now she's having the last laugh after forging a lucrative career as an exotic dancer and finding the love of her life.

Transformation: The unlikely pin-up girl said she felt like  an outcast at school and she was 'angry at the world'

The unlikely pin-up girl said: 'At school I felt like an outcast, people bullied me because of my size and I was angry at the world.

'Since getting famous as a dancer I've learned to be myself. Now all the people who ignored me at school want to be my friend on Facebook.

'I call myself a smile producer - not an exotic entertainer. I just want to put smiles on people's face.'

Growing up in the city suburbs with parents Sherry, 52, and Wayne, 53, Kat found life difficult and at 16 she was taken out of school to be homeschooled.

She said: 'High school was a difficult time, other kids were rude and brutally bitchy. I dreaded school every day - no one wanted to speak with me.'

At age 18 Kat visited a strip club with a friend who worked there and decided to get up and dance.

She said: 'Despite the bullying I was always proud of my body and by the end of the night I was on stage in the nude - it was such a buzz.

'A lot of us disabled people don't feel sexy because of our handicaps - but I don't think it's necessary.

Teenage days: Kat pictured with friends - she said during her younger years she often felt like an 'outcast'

Having the last laugh: 'Since getting famous as a dancer I've learned to be myself. Now all the people who ignored me at school want to be my friend on Facebook,' Kat says

Career choice: At age 18 Kat visited a strip club with a friend who worked there and decided to dance

'Everybody is sexy in their own way and personality is all that matters. You have to have a heart, that's really all it takes to be sexy in my book.

'During my first week of dancing I made $1,000 in one week, so I decided to make a living out of it.'

Since then Kat has appeared in clubs all over the U.S. as 'Kat the Midget Stripper' and also dances at birthdays and bachelor parties. 

While her profession is controversial for some - her family are generally supportive of what she does.

Her mother even hand-makes her stripper outfits, which don't come in her size. However, Kat's sister, Renee, is less enthusiastic.

Renee said: 'I've been to her shows before and they don't go there to see her, they go there to laugh at her. 

Support: While her profession is controversial for some - her family are generally supportive of what she does

Happy couple: There is no word on when Kat and Eich will marry 

'This job has taught me to appreciate my body and who I am - I'm so glad I found it,' Kat says of stripping

'It hurts a lot watching that because that's my baby sister. I wish she would stop but I don't think she will.'

But Kat has no plans to leave the stripping business just yet. 

She says her fiance doesn't mind what she does for a living and could never get her to stop anyway.

The brunette concluded: 'I give myself five more years if not longer. 

'It just depends on how much the world wants to work my joints on the stage in the next few years. We'll see how long I last.

'This job has taught me to appreciate my body and who I am - I'm so glad I found it.'

Whirlwind romance: Kat's fiance Eich is a soldier in the U.S. army and enjoys wrestling in his spare time

Perfect match: Eich has a full body tattoo from his neck to his ankles so is used to getting 'strange looks'

He continued: 'This whole world is filled with different kinds of types of people and you have to realise that some people will not accept you for who you are'
