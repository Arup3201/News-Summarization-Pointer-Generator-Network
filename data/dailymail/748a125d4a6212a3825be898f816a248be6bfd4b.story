Magistrate by day: JP Steven Hutchins applied for a licence to open a strip club

As one of the country’s youngest magistrates, Steven Hutchins is committed to keeping the peace.

However, he’s causing something of a brouhaha in his other role…as the manager of a string of strip clubs.

The 34-year-old’s double life came to light after he applied to open a fully nude lap dancing club in Maidstone.

The proposal was rejected by the local council but not before it caused a storm of protest among residents, some of whom questioned the wisdom of having a magistrate involved in the sex industry.

Mr Hutchins was only 28 when he was sworn in as a JP for Medway, Kent, in 2007. Then, he said he worked in the leisure industry for a national company.

Now, however, he is involved in a less salubrious business. He works as operations manager for the Aaron P Stone Group which owns strip clubs and runs a number of venues including Tenshi Gentlemen Nights – a Japanese-themed lap dancing bar.

His proposal for Maidstone – which involved the setting up of a club with private booths and nude pole dancing – attracted more than 120 letters of objection. Speaking at a council meeting which later threw out the plan, mother-of-two Dorcas Kingsford said: ‘I don’t want my children to grow up thinking that the sex industry in Maidstone is all right.

‘By allowing sex establishments in the town, you as a council are telling our children it’s all right, and it’s not all right.’

In support of his club plan, Mr Hutchins said: ‘We’re not here to discuss moral concerns.’

Rejections: More than 100 residents complained about the application for a fully nude lap-dancing club

When asked after the meeting if he 
used the services on offer at his establishments, he said: ‘Not really. I
go and visit other venues – you become a bit anaesthetised to it after 
time.’

He also defended his dual role, 
saying, ‘It’s important in law that you have a broad spectrum of life 
experience – and that’s why you sit on a panel of three (magistrates).’

Mr Hutchins, who is married, said that
evidence showed sex entertainment venues attracted less antisocial 
behaviour and crime than regular nightclubs. He said the sex club – to 
be open seven days a week until 6am – was planned for the upper floor of
a larger nightclub and would not be advertised outside.

He later said he was ‘disappointed’ 
with the decision to reject the club plan, adding: ‘I feel our 
application has been misunderstood by the public, press and the 
council.’ His company is considering whether to appeal.

Local Sam Greening, 42, said: ‘It’s a 
bit odd that a magistrate was behind plans to open a strip club. You 
wouldn’t really put those two jobs together – there’s enough sleaze 
around without having it in your face in the town centre.’

Full time operation: The strip club would have contained several private booths and remained open until 6am every day (picture posed by model)
