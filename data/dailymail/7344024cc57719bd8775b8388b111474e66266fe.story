Despite having his international future publicly questioned by Holland coach Louis van Gaal, Wesley Sneijder collected his 100th cap against Spain.

Just two months ago Van Gaal said the Galatasaray midfielder was not doing enough to even warrant a place in the Dutch squad – but on Friday night Sneijder was back in the heart of the Oranje’s midfield on a landmark occasion.

Century: Wesley Sneijder made his 100th appearance for Holland against Spain in the World Cup

Influential: Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder is back in favour with coach Louis van Gaal

The diminutive playmaker has had more ups and downs in his international career than most hundred-cap heroes, with a quarter final-winning brace against Brazil and receiving the Silver Ball for being voted the second best player at the 2010 finals contrasting with being stripped of the Dutch captaincy and a late World Cup final defeat after a lacklustre performance.

Speaking 
earlier this week, Sneijder said he had no intentions of ending his 
rollercoaster career which has also taken in spells at Ajax, Real 
Madrid, Inter Milan and most recently Galatasaray at club level.

‘When I was 21 or 22 I used to think footballers of 30 were old. They were close to finishing their careers,’ he said.

‘That
 happens but there is no way I'm stopping just yet. You think this is my
 last tournament? Are you crazy? You won't get rid of me over the next 
four years.’

Leader: Despite being dropped as captain in favour of Robin van Persie, Sneijder is a key figure in the squad

Got it, boss: Van Gaal has given Sneijder another chance, despite criticising his form and fitness

‘Everything that was said about me in the past is forgotten. Also the question of the captaincy. I'm looking only forward.’

The Dutch physios even spoke of their disbelief at Sneijder’s fitness when the national side got together at the end of May – amazing when less than 12 months ago Van Gaal said he was ‘not getting the message’ and questioned his fitness levels.

Sneijder became the eight-youngest player to play for the Netherlands when he made his senior debut against Portugal in 2003, just a month after making his Under-21s international bow.

Euro 2004 
came slightly too soon for him, contributing just 57 minutes of play off
 the bench as the Dutch made it to the semi-finals.

But by 2006 Sneijder was ready to take centre stage for his country, although perhaps the Dutch squad weren’t quite as ready.

Experience: Wesley Sneijder has played at three World Cups and three European Championships

He
 started all four games but was flying home early with his team-mates 
after they were eliminated by Portugal in the infamous ‘Battle of 
Nuremberg’ that saw 16 yellow cards dished out.

Both 2008’s European Championships and the 2010 World Cup saw the number 10 at his best, being named in the team of the tournament for both competitions.

Sneijder also picked up the Silver Ball in South Africa as the second-best player behind Diego Forlan, scoring five goals to eclipse his two in Austria and Switzerland.

Poland and Ukraine in 2012 wasn’t quite as successful but after a spell out of the side Sneijder will be keen to show Van Gaal and his doubters what they could have missed out on – as well as getting revenge for the final defeat four years ago.
