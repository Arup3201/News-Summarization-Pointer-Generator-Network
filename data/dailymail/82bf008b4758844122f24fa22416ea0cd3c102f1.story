Unlike traditional speed cameras, the new gantry devices, pictured, are painted grey, making them harder to spot

Labour will ban 'stealth' speed cameras being used on motorways, MailOnline can reveal.

The party says all road cameras should be painted bright yellow to be clearly visible to motorists and should not be used to raise money for councils.

It comes amid fury at a new grey 'stealth' camera installed on the M25 in Kent which has caught 1,500 motorists in just three months since being installed in October.

The new cameras have contributed to recent spike in speeding fines issued to motorists.

More than 115,000 motorists in England and Wales were issued with fines of at least £100 by magistrates last year – the highest level in four years.

Despite the controversy over the new technology transport chiefs are planning to roll out the digital cameras across 300 miles of Britain's busiest motorways.

The Highways Agency has claimed that the current government guidelines do not apply to motorways – allowing the 'secret' digital cameras to be installed.

Unlike old yellow speed cameras, the Highways Agency Digital Enforcement Camera Systems, or Hadecs, are grey and mounted on tall poles, making them much harder to spot.

And, while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time, the digital cameras can scan four.

The new cameras also do not rely on marks on the ground to catch a speeding driver – and work instead by comparing two images taken by front and rear facing cameras.

Michael Dugher, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary, told MailOnline he would move to ban the 'stealth' cameras on motorways by introducing new rules making it clear that all cameras should be painted yellow and clearly visible to drivers.

Labour will also review whether new regulation is needed to ensure speed cameras are not just being used as a revenue raiser for cash-strapped local councils.

In the three months since the stealth cameras have been installed on the M25, pictured, 1,500 drivers have been caught breaking the 70mph limit

Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher has vowed to introduce tough new rules banning stealth cameras

The grey cameras are being installed across Britain's busiest motorways can  track dozens cars across four lanes in the heaviest of traffic.

Conventional cameras can only scan one lane and are usually painted yellow - but these are grey.

Attached to the motorway gangway - front and rear-facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle's speed. 

The same camera system is also used to grab the vehicle's number plate and match it up with the national vehicle registration database. 

They enforce variable speed limits and also the standard 70mph speed limit if needed. 

Mr Dugher told MailOnline: 'The aim of speed cameras should be to end up with safer roads by changing the behaviour of motorists - which is what happened under the previous Labour government when cameras were yellow - and they should be used in accident blackspots and on especially dangerous stretches of road.

'New figures show that more and more motorists are getting hit withspeeding fines by the proliferation of grey, hidden 'stealth' cameras on our motorways - yet at the same time our road safety record is getting worse.

'Speed cameras should be about slowing drivers down and changing the way people drive. They should not be being used as a cash cow for ministers.'

The new cameras are being rolled out across the M25, as well as the M1, M3, M6 and M60.

In total more than 300 miles of Britain's busiest motorways will be monitored by the new generation of cameras.

Labour has insisted it is not anti-speed camera – pointing to the dramatic fall in deaths and serious injuries on the road since speed cameras were introduced.

Between 1998 and 2009 traffic rose by 15 per cent, but there was a 44 per cent drop in the number of deaths and serious injuries.

Where the new cameras will be placed: Several stretches of road are being upgraded to become 'smart motorways', with new speed cameras a part of improvements. Above, a map detailing which will be affected

But the party said progress cutting car crashes was slowing significantly – with Britain losing its top spot on the leader board for road safety in the EU.

The number of people killed on motorways increased by 14 per cent to 100 in 2013, the first increase since 2005.

And the number of road deaths has now increased over the last three quarters, alarming safety experts.

The business behind new 'stealth' speed cameras being installed across Britain is being paid more than £2million by the taxpayer to help catch more drivers.

The controversial technology has been introduced to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limit on the M25 in Kent.

And the same technology is being introduced on a northern section of the M25 and also parts of the M1, M3, M60 and M6.

But it has emerged that Redflex Travel Systems Ltd agreed a £2.1million deal with the Government to set up the system.

The Highways Agency confirmed to MailOnline they pay £150,000 per site to install the equipment and· £25,000 per site per year to maintain the equipment.

The company's UK boss Ronald Moore has refused to comment on whether the cameras are unfair on motorists.

The cameras, called the Hadecs3, enforce variable speed limits on motorways when they are congested.

But when the speed limit at 70mph they are not switched off, instead they then catch people breaking the limit.
