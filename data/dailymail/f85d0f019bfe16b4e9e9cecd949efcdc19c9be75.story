A stone bridge reputed to be 3,000 years old was swept away as flooding continued to bring chaos to parts of Britain yesterday.

Downpours over the Christmas break and through New Year’s Eve are likely to ensure 2012 was one of the wettest years on record.

As celebrations began, more than an inch and a quarter of rain was dumped on to already saturated ground and more than 200 flood alerts and 90 flood warnings were in place.

The River Barle in Somerset swelled 
so much that it destroyed the ‘Tarr Steps’ –  a Grade I listed ancient 
monument formed of massive stones weighing up to two tons apiece. The 
slabs, some measuring 8ft long, were swept away as downed trees crashed 
into them.

Local resident Martin Hesp said: ‘I have lived in the area for over 50 years and I have never seen anything like this before.

‘It must have been some mighty trees which were carried downstream and smashed through them.’

The bridge links the Somerset villages of Withypool and Dulverton.

It was last damaged in floods in 1952
 when the stone slabs were washed up to 50ft downstream and had to be 
recovered. Since then the slabs have been numbered to aid 
reassembly.

Although the first recorded mention of the Tarr Steps was in the 14th century, some believe it could be far older

Millions are facing a difficult 
return to work tomorrow after the Christmas break, with numerous roads 
left potholed and damaged by the weather. The only good news is that 
forecasters believe the first month of the new year will be considerably
 drier – if colder – than November and December.

The South West had been braced for 
the worst of the flooding, but there were similar fears elsewhere too. 
Mobile flood barriers were set up in cities and towns including Oxford, 
Worcester, Shrewsbury and Bewdley.

Larger rivers such as the Thames, Severn and Wye are likely remain high for several days.

Along Dorset’s Jurassic Coast, 
sections of cliff threatened to slide towards the sea at the weekend, 
threatening beach chalets and creating a risk for beach-goers and fossil
 hunters.

Weymouth coastguard Philip Chappell 
said: ‘The amount of rain we’ve had recently is turning parts of the 
cliff into a potentially dangerous porridge.’

There were fears that a woman whose 
body was pulled from the sea at a ferry terminal in Southampton 
yesterday had been a victim of the weather.

 Katharine Evans said: ‘It is as important as ever to be prepared for 
flooding, keep up to date with the latest warnings and, if you are at 
risk, to move valuable items to safety.’

England has already suffered its wettest year since records began in 1910, with 43.1in falling between January 1 and Boxing Day.

The Met Office said 1.8 inches of 
rain on the last day of the year would set a new UK record – although 
final confirmation is not expected until next week.

After all the rain, however, the 
start to the new year is expected to be relatively calm, with only light
 winds and localised showers in the South.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams 
said: ‘As of tomorrow, the weather will get nicer. There will be showers
 around here and there, but because of high pressure building from the 
South we can expect calmer, drier conditions from tomorrow across the 
UK.

'It is sure to provide welcome respite from the unsettled weather we saw throughout December, and indeed the whole of 2012.

‘In January, the temperature will 
initially be above average, before getting a little colder and moving 
closer the average towards the middle of the month.’

Legend has it that the devil built the bridge at Tarr Steps and had rights over sunbathing on the stones.

Anyone who tried to cross the bridge, it was said, did so at the risk that they would be killed by the devil, who swore an oath to crush anyone who passed from one side to the other.

It is claimed that locals once sent a cat across the bridge to test the myth – and the animal was vaporised. Only after confrontation with the local parson is the devil supposed to have withdrawn the threat.

The first recorded mention of the Tarr Steps was in the 14th century – but some experts believe the bridge could date back to 1000 BC.

It is constructed of stone slabs supported on stone piers, which stick three feet out of the water when the river is at its normal level.

The name ‘Tarr’ is thought to have derived from the Celtic word ‘tochar’ for causeway.
