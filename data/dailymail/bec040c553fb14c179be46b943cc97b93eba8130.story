A man 28-year-old man charged with murder in the deaths of four people, including an 18-month-old girl, at a Kansas farm told investigators that one of the victims took the first shot at another victim, a detective testified Tuesday.

Kyle Trevor allegedly killed three adults and the girl over a two-week period in late April and early May.

He is on trial for capital murder in the killings of 21-year-old Kaylie Bailey and her daughter Lana-Leigh Bailey, according to the Kansas City Star.

He is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of housemates Andrew Stout, 30, and Steven E. White, 31.

Kyle Flack is led from the detention center to the Franklin County Courthouse in Ottawa on Tuesday, March 11, 2014. Flack is charged with killing four people

Flack, 28, has been charged with capital murder, first-degree murder and attempted rape in the killings last May

The bodies of Andrew Stout, Steven White and Kaylie Bailey were discovered at Stout's farm in Ottawa, about 50 miles southwest of Kansas City

He also is charged with the attempted rape of Kaylie Bailey, who was found partially nude, and with being a felon in possession of a firearm.

The day of his arrest, Flack first told officers he’d heard something had happened to a friend, and he asked if the officers could tell him what, according to testimony.

Later in the day, during 10 hours of questioning spread over two sessions, Flack allegedly spilled out how at least one of the deaths occurred.

According to testimony from Franklin County Sheriff’s Deputy Jeremi Thompson, Flack said Stout had confronted White about rent money he owed and had ordered White to move out.

Stout followed White outside carrying a shotgun.

He shot White then handed the shotgun to Flack, who fired another shot.

'I shot him. He dies,' Thompson quoted Flack as saying.

Before the preliminary hearing started, Franklin County District Judge Thomas Sachse ruled that prosecutors could introduce Flack’s statement into evidence.

But Deputy Kansas Attorney General Victor Braden said prosecutors only intended to use the portion concerning White’s death.

Authorities previously have said that White was killed between April 20 and April 29, and Stout was killed April 29.

The rape attempt on Bailey allegedly happened May 1, the day she and her daughter were killed, they have said.

Stout’s boss testified that he didn’t show up for work April 29.

A friend who went by Stout’s house that day said Flack was the only one there and told him that Stout had left to run errands.

Bailey’s mother, Lisa Smith, testified that she last saw her daughter and granddaughter the morning of May 1 at her Olathe home.

Bailey was planning to go to Stout’s house, her mother testified.

A friend of Flack’s testified that Flack called him May 3 before coming to the friend’s Emporia home.

Concerned friends of Stout called police to the farm twice before authorities finally found the bodies May 6.

By then, the bodies were significantly decomposed, according to testimony.

A tarp and cinder blocks covered White’s body in a detached garage, investigators testified.

He had been shot once in the head and once in the chest.

Investigators found the bodies of Stout and Bailey inside the home’s master bedroom, beneath a pile of clothes.

Bailey was found naked from the waist down, a red bandana tied around her neck and her arms held behind her by a black zip tie.

She had what appeared to be a gunshot wound to her head, investigators testified.

Authorities found Bailey’s purse in a laundry basket in the bedroom, and they found a child’s car seat in the garage.

Several spent shotgun shells littered the bedroom.

One shell was found in the garage and another in a trash can.

Police spotted Bailey’s car in Emporia before arresting Flack at the friend’s apartment, where they also found a duffle bag that reportedly belonged to Flack.

Among its contents were black zip ties.

Three days later, searchers found a small child’s body inside suitcase in a creek near Stubbs Road, just across the Franklin County line into Osage County.

Sheets of paper scattered along the creek bank bore the names of Bailey and her daughter.

Searchers also found diapers dumped there.

The trial continues.
