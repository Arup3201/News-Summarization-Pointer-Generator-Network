Miami Dolphins star Jonathan Martin says the persistence of vulgar language by the team made him feel 'trapped' - so he decided it was best 'just to remove myself from the situation'.

His comments, which aired on NBC Nightly News on Tuesday and the Today show on Wednesday, came in his first interview since his bullying scandal broke last year. He left the Dolphins in October and claimed he was harassed daily by teammates, including guard Richie Incognito.

'I'm a grown man,' said Martin, 24. 
'I've been in locker rooms. There's vulgar language used in locker 
rooms. One instance doesn't bother me. It's the persistence of it.

Speaking out: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin told NBC he felt 'trapped' in the team's locker room

'I wish I would have had more tools to solve my situation. I felt trapped, like I didn't have a way to make it right. It came down to a point where I thought it was best to remove myself from the situation.'

While he said that he understood hazing went on within teams - and was supportive of 'pranks' - he felt that it was more personal in his case.

'Comments of racial nature,' he said. 'Aggressive, sexual comments related to my sister and my mother... I don't think there's any place for that.

'I've spoken to former teammates in locker rooms across he NFL and asked, "Does this stuff go on?" and the consensus was this was not normal.'

As the text messages and vulgar comments continued, Martin said he began to question what he was doing to deserve the treatment.

'Other people got it too,' he said. 'I cant say why I got it more.

Hurt: In the NBC interview, he told Tony Dungy that he felt he was attacked more than other players and didn't think there was a place for insults about his mother and sister

'I started turning it back on myself: "What am I doing wrong to be treated like this?" I was trying with all my being to do whatever I could to be a member of this culture.'

Throughout the treatment, he said he spoke to some of his coaches - not including Joe Philbin - about his concerns, but never divulged specifics as he didn't want to 'snitch' on his teammates.

But when the treatment continued beyond his rookie season, he said that he had to remove himself from the situation 'for my own health'.

Owner Stephen Ross said he's proud of the way the franchise responded to the case.

Incognito was suspended for eight games on November 3 and was not allowed back on the field while New York attorney Ted Wells led an NFL investigation. His report will be released after the Super Bowl.

Ross, speaking at a news conference to introduce the Dolphins' new general manager, said he spoke with the NFL and Wells to get a sense of what will be included in the report.

'I have an idea what will be in it,' 
Ross said Tuesday. 'I haven't seen the report. I don't know exactly what
 his conclusion is. When it comes out, we'll do what has to be done.

'In
 my mind, I know what direction we're going. ... The respect that we 
gained by how we handled the situation that took place here says a lot 
about this organization and the people that are running it.'

Wells' report is expected to address the
 roles of coaches and staff in the case. One issue is whether anyone on 
the coaching staff ordered Incognito to toughen up Martin.

The case inspired a national debate about workplace bullying.

Incognito, who is white, confirmed that he had left an expletive-ridden message on Martin's voicemail, making racial slurs and saying he wanted to defecate in his teammate's mouth.

'Hey, wassup, you half n***** piece of [expletive],' he said in the message. 'I saw you on Twitter, you been training ten weeks.

'[I want to] [expletive] in your 
[expletive] mouth. [I'm going to] slap your [expletive] mouth. [I'm 
going to] slap your real mother across the face (laughter). [Expletive] 
you, you’re still a rookie. I’ll kill you.'

Incognito later said he was embarrassed about the voicemail, but insisted it was not malicious.

'I'm
 embarrassed by my actions,' he told Fox Sports. 'I understand why a lot
 of eyebrows get raised, but people don’t know how Jon and I communicate
 to one another.'

Incognito becomes a free agent this winter. When asked if he or the 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin will play for the Dolphins again, Ross equivocated.

'I don't believe so - well, I can't say that,' Ross said, adding with a chuckle, 'Therefore I retract that.'

Part of Martin's interview aired on the Nightly News on Tuesday and on Today on Wednesday. The full interview airs on NBCSN's 'Pro Football Talk' on Wednesday at 6.30pm.
