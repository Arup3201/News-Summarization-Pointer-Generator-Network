Complaint: District Judge Lonnie Cox, sitting at 
Galveston County drug court, Texas, allegedly ripped up court 
papers and threw them in the air

A judge screamed swear words at a pregnant defendant and told her she was worthless before storming out of a court room, it has been alleged.

District Judge Lonnie Cox, sitting at Galveston County drug court, Texas, also allegedly ripped up court papers and threw them in the air when he discovered the womn had missed probation meetings regarding her drugs conviction.

Wesley Clements, acting on behalf of Maricelda Marie Aguilar, 22, of Alvin,  said he had asked Judge Cox to recuse himself from the hearing following the outburst.

He said he had filed a complaint with the State Commission on Judicial Conduct about Judge Cox's alleged conduct earlier this month.

Judge Cox said he was unable to comment and filed an order refusing to recuse himself.

Aguilar, who is seven months 
pregnant, has been in custody since July for violating her probation for
an earlier drug conviction. 

While
in prison she developed a bacterial infection which could harm her 
unborn baby, and Judge Cox had agreed that she be moved from Montgomery 
County Jail to a rehabilitation centre until she gave birth.

However,
the outburst was sparked when, at a hearing on October 5, Judge Cox 
discovered Aguilar had missed several probation meetings.

According to www.chron.com, the recusal motion said: 'The judge while sitting on the bench in open court looked at the plea papers and then screamed.

'This is s***. This kind of b******* is not what the drug court should be doing and it is just costing the taxpayers money'.

The motion continued to explain how the judge told the defendant she was 'worthless' and 'not worth the paper and ink that the plea agreement was written on'.

He then ripped up the court documents and threw them in the air before 'storming out'.

Fourteen witnesses apparently saw the incident, including Aguilar's mother. 

The complaint is ongoing.
