Kids love to throw themselves about whether it be jumping into swimming pools, skateboarding or perhaps performing a handstand.

It sounds harmless enough, but just as the United States Postal Service was about to release a series of stamps encouraging kids to keep active, it's decided to cancel the lot for fear they may end up taking the blame for youngsters hurting themselves.

The stamps were created to commemorate Michelle Obama’s 'Let’s Move!' program and although the children are seen to be having fun, they’re engaged in unsafe activities or not wearing protective gear.

Activites: U.S. Postal Service hoped to raise awareness about the importance of physical activity in achieving a healthy lifestyle

Unsafe: Whilst is may be fun, a Cannonball dive could be unsafe

Dangerous: A headstand without a helmet

Asking for trouble: Skateboarding without kneepads

'The stamps are on hold with the printer and we have not made a decision at this point, right now, with respect to how we are going to move forward,' a USPS spokesman told the website.

According to a report from Linn’s Stamp News, the President’s Council on Fitness Sports and Nutrition and the first lady’s Let’s Move campaign raised concerns about three of the 15 the stamps in the series.

Ideas: U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama developed the Let's Move Program to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation

The two White House entities had concerns over stamps with a man doing a cannonball into a swimming pool, a skateboarder not wearing kneepads, and a child doing a handstand without a helmet.

The unsafe depictions came to light after USPS Marketing chief Nagisa Manabe asked Michelle Obama to take part in a first day ceremony for the stamps

That was apparently the first time the stamps had been reviewed by the Sports Council.

The series is set to be destroyed, but a final decision won't be made until sometime next year.

On track: The initiative has the initially stated goal of 'solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight'
