An elderly multimillionaire hid the death of his mother from the government for more than two decades so he could cash her Social Security checks.

Raymond O’Dell, 70, of both Washington and Arizona, pocketed more than $200,000 in benefits over 23 years of lies, he was sentenced to six months in prison during a Monday hearing.

He did not notify authorities of his mother's death, and since the various government agencies involved do not sync their computer systems, the con artist was not caught until the state began an operation to cross-reference several cases, a U.S. Attorney's Office spokesperson told MailOnline.

O’Dell’s net worth of just under $4million did not stop him from accepting checks intended for his dead mother, prosecutors charged.

The swindler is also expected to plead 
guilty later this month to charges he stole about $100,000 from the Ohio
 Public Employees Retirement System, according to court documents cited a
 Seattle Post-Intelligencer report.

He accumulated his wealth through ownership of multiple Burger King and Taco Bell franchises in the Seattle area, as well as shrewd real estate investments.

‘Social Security fraud cases often involve genuinely impoverished persons who steal to improve an otherwise desperate existence,’ U.S. Attorney Seth Wilkinson said in court papers. ‘While those circumstances do not excuse theft from social programs, they mitigate the crime.

‘Here, however, (O’Dell) has had a lucrative business career as the owner of fast food restaurants and real estate,’ Mr Wilkinson continued.

The septuagenarian’s lawyer argued that he was broke when the scheme began, and that he saw the money as a way to provide for his family well getting back on his feet.

Mr O’Dell was ‘a desperate, but good man, who saw an opportunity to provide for his family’s health in 1989, when he was at his lowest point, and took it,’ said defense attorney Laurence Finegold.

‘Like making a deal with the devil, however, once that decision was made there was no way out for Mr. O’Dell,’ the lawyer claimed, saying that to stop taking the checks would out the millionaire as a fraud.

He was further enabled through a lack of inter-agency cooperation among Social Security, law enforcement and other government entities.

The
 agencies began working together last year to cross-reference deaths and
 benefit recipients. He had no choice but to come clean when an 
investigator asked to speak with his mother, the spokesperson added.

His is one of a number of similar cases brought to court in the last year, according to the spokesperson.

The con artist is originally from Seattle, but recently moved to Arizona to retire with his long-time wife, potential prison time puts a serious crimp in those plans.

Mr Finegold argued that paying back the ill-gotten gains will almost completely drain the more than $431,000 authorities say the retirees have in cash while leaving him likely unable to draw his own Social Security benefits.

Mr O’Dell requested though his attorney that he be allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest, and for only 120 days, plus 200 hours of community service.

He instead received six months in prison, followed by six months of house arrest, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

He will also be placed under three years supervision and has been ordered to pay $188,436.74 restitution, plus another $20,000 in fines.

His declining health was cited as the main reason for the request.

Authorities were not swayed.

‘The community needs to see that theft of public money on this scale results in prison time proportionate to the scale of the theft,' said Mr Wilkinson.

The fast food franchisee is scheduled to be sentenced Monday for his first plea deal. The exact timing of his second plea deal has not yet been determined.
