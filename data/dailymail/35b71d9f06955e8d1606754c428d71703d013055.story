This is the private jet you'll never want to fly.

The Gulfstream air ambulance may look like the luxury pleasure liner used by celebrities and moguls to travel the world in style ... but inside it is anything but. 

For this is the plane used to bring U.S. Ebola victims home to America.

Most of its cabin space is taken up by the sealed-tight isolation chamber - or aeromedical biological containment system where patients are monitored around the clock.

Sealed: The collapsible plastic tent is designed to house a single patient and stop any infectious germs from escaping

Disease control: It was built to transfer employees of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) exposed to all manner of contagious diseases for treatment.

Beside it is an antechamber where medics put on their protective 'moon suits' before entering the tent to treat their ailing passenger.

Next to the isolation chamber is a specialist toilet for the patient to use. 

'As you know from a variety of reports, Ebola causes a lot of bodily reactions, and we have to be able to take care of that,' Dent Thompson, vice president of owner Phoenix Air, told ABC.

The  jet, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has already been used to ferry two American missionaries — Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol — infected with the disease in August.

And yesterday at was used again to transfer nurse Nina Pham, 26, from Texas to Maryland after she was infected while caring for U.S 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, who tragically died on October 10 from the deadly disease.

It is one of about four such units around the country for testing and treating people who may have been exposed to very dangerous viruses, said Dr. Eileen Farnon, a Temple University doctor who formerly worked at the CDC and led teams investigating past Ebola outbreaks in Africa. 

Sole purpose: But for now it has only one purpose: to bring U.S. doctors and nurses home when their protective suits are compromised while treating Ebola victims in West Africa

Dangerous: It is one of about four such units around the country for testing and treating people who may have been exposed to very dangerous viruses

State-of-the-art: The cabin is fitted out with a range of state-of-the-art equipment

Few seats: There are some seats for doctors to sit in on the journey

Brantly, who works for Samaritan's Purse, was treating Ebola patients at a Liberia hospital. Writebol also worked there for another U.S. mission group called SIM.

The government is working to ensure that any Ebola-related evacuations 'are carried out safely, thereby protecting the patient and the American public,' the State Department's Harf said.

Ebola is not spread in the air, but only through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids from an infected person.

It comes as Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital released a video which shows the bittersweet moment Ebola-patient Ms Pham said goodbye to her doctor before leaving Dallas for further treatment in Maryland.

In the video released last night, at Ms Pham's request, her treating physician gets emotional as he sees her off on her trip to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda.

'Thanks for getting well. Thanks for being part of the volunteer team to take care of our first patient,' Dr Weinstein is heard saying, as he focuses the camera on Ms Pham, reclining in her hospital bed.

'It means a lot. This has been a huge effort by all of you,' he adds, before tearing up.

Ms Pham then smiles and tells her doctor not to cry.

'We're really proud of you,' Dr Weinstein says.

Ms Pham was discharged from the Dallas hospital on Thursday evening to fanfare as her coworkers gathered outside the building to see her off, holding up signs like 'Get well' and 'You're a rock star'.

She landed in Bethesda at around 10.40pm Eastern Time, and was admitted to NIH hospital shortly before midnight.
