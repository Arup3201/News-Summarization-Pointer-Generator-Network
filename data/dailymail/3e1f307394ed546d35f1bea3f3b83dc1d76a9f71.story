Cleaning cars and performing somersaults for £2.30. It was once all in a day's work for Arsenal ace Alexis Sanchez.

The 25-year-old cost the Gunners £30million when he arrived from Barcelona in the summer.

But the forward, who is understood to be pocketing a wage of £150,000-a-week, has reflected on his childhood in Chile where he couldn't even afford to buy a new pair of boots.

'My first pair of boots were given to me by the Mayor of Tocopilla after my mum went to speak with him,' said Sanchez, as reported by the Daily Express.

'One day he turned up at my house and just gave me them. I was made up, like a dog with two tails!

'As I could do somersaults, people would say to me, 'do a somersault and we'll give you 50 or 100 Pesos'.

'I also used to clean cars.'

Sanchez is back in his native Chile as he prepares to take on South American rivals Peru in a friendly on Saturday, before taking on Bolivia next Wednesday (October 15).

Sanchez's tale is one that has taken him from rags to riches via River Plate, Udinese and Barcelona

Despite playing in the top tiers of Italian and Spanish football, with Udinese and Barcelona, Sanchez insists the Premier League is the hardest.

'Compared to the other leagues I've played in, I think this is the hardest and I like it a lot, I really do,' Sanchez told Arsenal.com.

'Before I signed, people had told me about how Arsenal were a big club with lots of quality players. Now I'm here I look at all the players during training and realise just what fantastic quality they all have.'

With a wealth of attacking talent at the Gunners, Sanchez has started life at Arsenal in a variety of forward roles but admits he feels 'slightly more comfortable' when he is deployed on the right.

'I can run and cut inside on my left foot, but any position is good for me as long as I'm playing football because I hate being on the bench,' added Sanchez. 'If you take me off it's like you're taking the ball off me.

'I want to win everything. Looking at the coaches and players we have, with a winning attitude and ambition, we can win absolutely anything.'

Sanchez, attempts to evade the challenge of Branislav Ivanovic, insists the Premier League is the hardest test

Arsenal entertain Hull on October 18 and will be looking to get their title bid back on track following last weekend's defeat by Chelsea.

Manager Arsene Wenger will be hoping the former Udinese star comes through the international break unscathed, following Wednesday's news that injured Mesut Ozil faces 12 weeks on the sidelines.

Sanchez has thrilled Arsenal fans with some stellar performances, collecting the club's player of the month award for September.

And with five goals to his name so far this season, it's fair to say he has been flipping good...
