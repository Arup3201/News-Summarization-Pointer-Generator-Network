It's rare that devoted parents Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall are seen out at parties or fancy black tie events, let alone out of their much loved casual sportswear.

But the Royal pair stepped out in style on Wednesday, to attend the England rugby team's Six Nations 2015 review dinner, following the climax of the tournament which ended last weekend.

Arriving at London private members club Annabel's, Zara, 33, and former England rugby player Mike, 36, looked every inch the glamorous couple.

Escorted by her husband, who himself earned  75 caps playing for the England rugby team before retiring last summer, Zara continued the run of glamorous outfits we've recently seen her wear to attend the horse racing at Cheltenham Festival.

Though normally pictured wearing more casual sportswear, the professional equestrian slipped into a flattering black dress for the evening.

Arriving in style, the Queen's eldest granddaughter covered up in a gorgeous black wool coat, embellished with elegant gold embroidery.

Keeping her accessories simple, Zara added classic black strappy shoes and a simple black clutch bag, to complete her look.

Attending the dinner to celebrate the end of the Six Nations 2015 rugby tournament last weekend, it has been a busy year for the new parents already, who celebrated their daughter's first birthday in January.

Seen at Cheltenham Festival with her mother Princess Anne last week, Zara has also been focusing on her own equestrian career, hoping to qualify for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.

Following his retirement from professional rugby in August last year, Mike recently starred in reality TV show The Jump.

Competing against other celebrities including Jodie Kidd, Lady Victoria Hervey and daughter of TV presenting duo Richard and Judy, Chloe Madeley, he made it to the show's final.

The final ski challenge proved to be too much for the rugby legend however - he was beaten by series winner and former TOWIE cast member Joey Essex.
