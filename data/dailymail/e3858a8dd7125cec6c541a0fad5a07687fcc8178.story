An unknown artist ‘dared’ by friends to paint his own portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge has received the ultimate accolade – the approval of Kate and William themselves.

Tom Sutton-Smith was inspired to create the unusual oil painting after friends told him he could ‘do better’ than the Duchess’s first official portrait by Paul Emsley, which was slammed by critics as ‘rotten’ and ‘catastrophic’ when unveiled last year.

The new picture was shown to Kate and William during a visit to Perthshire last week – and the couple liked it so much that they now plan to hang it in Kensington Palace.

Glenys Andrews, of the Perthshire Open Studios, who presented the portrait to the couple, said: ‘When William saw it he said, “Wow – it’s brilliant” before adding, “I’m having it in my room.”

Then he and Catherine had a playful argument. Catherine said she wanted it in her room. They both liked it.’

Mr Sutton-Smith – who was in Paris during the visit – said: ‘Nobody knows how somebody will react to their portrait but I was both flattered and delighted by Kate and William’s reaction.’
