For one it was the ecstasy of victory.

But for two other Brits, it was the end of the Wimbledon dream.

Our women players experienced mixed fortunes yesterday – but 2011 will still go down as one of their best years in recent history.

There were high hopes for  teenagers Laura Robson and Heather Watson, but only Laura managed to get through to fight another day.

Being stretched: Robson's first round victory was her maiden Grand Slam win

It was the 17-year-old’s first  ever 
win at a senior Grand Slam event, and victory on the green grass of home
will have made it that much sweeter.

Anne Keothavong, meanwhile, had 
already made it through to the second round – but lost late last night. A
fourth Briton, Elena Baltacha, will play her second round match today.

Three years ago Laura became the 
darling of the All England Club when she won the Junior title and since 
then expectation has been heaped on her shoulders.

Recently she has struggled with injury and a growth spurt that has taken her to just under 6ft. But she battled back from a set down against the world number 76 to win. Laura is ranked 254th in the world.

German Angelique Kerber, 23, looked like she would win easily in the first set, but Laura came through 4-6, 7-6, 6-4

Tough task: Robson will have her work cut out in the second round against triple Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova

Here come the girls: Robson was joined in round two by British number one Elena Baltacha and number three Anne Keothavong, who both won on Monday

Meanwhile Heather, ranked 93rd in the
world, broke down in tears in her post-match press conference after 
struggling with an elbow injury during her first round match against 
France’s Mathilde Johannsson.

The 19-year-old British number three started to sob as she criticised her performance.

But she ignored an official’s offer to halt the interview.

‘I just feel like there’s no excuses 
now. I know how to play tennis,’ she said through her tears. ‘This is 
what I prepare for. This is why I play tennis every day, so I should be 
ready. I feel like I should be winning these matches.

‘It’s so frustrating and I was just disappointed that I lost.

‘I’ve never felt anything like  this 
and I just really wanted to win today. And I thought I had the match. 
But it’s just frustrating because I just really wanted to do well.’

The Guernsey teenager took the first set 6-2, but then felt her elbow go and had it strapped up soon after.

Medics wrapped her arm tightly in 
bandages to curb the pain but it clearly  had an effect on her play. She
went on to lose  2-6, 6-4, 6-4. There was some consolation though, as 
the keen Manchester United fan was cheered by tweets from Rio Ferdinand 
saying how impressed he was with her performance.

He wrote: ‘Unfortunate to see Heather Watson lose today,  she looks a real prospect. Talent and guts.’

Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal were out on the practice courts in the rain ahead of their second round matches

Familiar scenes: Rain interrupted parts of the day's play but held off towards evening for Laura Robson's stunning win

Fans wait patiently for the rain to pass on day three of tournament. Organisers are already struggling with the backlog caused by Monday's rain

Wiping the tears away, Heather said: 
‘That’s really nice. I’m a Man U fan. I have to be Man U because my dad 
is, he is from Manchester.’

Three second round qualifiers – 
Laura, Miss Baltacha and Miss Keothavong – represents a high level of 
achievement for British women’s tennis.

Not since 2004, when four British women made it into the second round, has there been such success for our ladies.

But Miss Keothavong lost her second round match last night in straight sets.

Laura will face Russian former champion Maria Sharapova today.

Hours of play were lost to bad weather on the outer courts

As the British tennis No.1 he could be excused for regarding the Centre Court as his home.

But yesterday Andy Murray was kicked off Wimbledon's premier court after other players had apparently complained of favouritism.

Despite
the presence of the Duchess of Cornwall in the royal box, he was 
shunted off to the less prestigious No.1 Court to make way for matches 
featuring lesser-seeded players such as Venus Williams and Andy Roddick.

No fancy roof yesterday to protect Andy Murray's game from the rain

Up until last year Murray, 24, had played all of his matches, save one, on Centre.

However
after some of the top seeds suggested this was an unfair advantage, 
particularly with the new roof ensuring it is the only court where rain 
doesn't interrupt matches, the All England Club decided to rotate 
Murray's appearances.

Yesterday was only his third time on No.1 Court – and both fans and commentators alike ridiculed the decision.

Three-times
Wimbledon winner John McEnroe said: 'If I had made the schedule, I 
would have put Murray on this [Centre] Court. Roddick is a three-time 
finalist and certainly a hall of fame player, but I'm not sure his match
is going to have people saying, “I gotta see that!”'

Murray's
girlfriend Kim Sears was so unfamiliar with the No.1 Court that she got
lost and needed a steward to show her to her seat.

Being on Court One did little to affect his game as Murray comfortably beat Tobias Kamke from Germany

Even the presence of the Duchess of Cornwall wasn't enough for organisers to let Murray play in Centre Court

Spectators were furious at paying upwards of £54 a ticket to see the Scot on Court One

Murray himself said: 'Being on Centre
Court is certainly a big help now because you know that, whatever the 
weather, you're going to get on, so you can prepare for your match 
knowing there won't be a lot of stopping and starting.'

Centre
Court ticket holders who had paid upwards of £54 each expecting to see 
the Scot's match were also furious that they didn't get to see it.

Carol Haynes, who was watching with her daughter Kate, said: 'Murray should definitely be on Centre Court.

'He's British and this is a British tournament.

'Camilla and the rest of the royal box were obviously hoping to see a British player but they got Americans instead.'

Tournament
director Ian Ritchie defended the decision, saying: 'We think in the 
interest of fairness, and that covers all the players and all the top 
seeds, that they can't play all their matches on Centre Court. So we 
have to move them about a little bit and yesterday was the day we 
decided to move Andy.'

Responding
to criticism from fans, he said: 'We always make clear to all the 
ticket holders that there is no guarantee of who they are going to see.

However
the change of court clearly didn't faze Murray. He breezed through his 
second round match against the unseeded German Tobias Kamke in straight 
sets.

Victorious: Until last year Murray had played all but one of his games on Centre Court

The
row over Monday’s closure of Murray Mount escalated into a full-blown 
war of words yesterday, after the health and safety watchdog attacked 
the decision.

Judith 
Hackitt, chairman of the Health and Safety Executive, issued an open 
letter mocking Wimbledon chiefs’ move to switch off the giant screen on 
the sodden slope in case fans slipped and injured themselves.

She pointed out that ‘people have been walking up and down wet grassy slopes for years without catastrophic consequences’.

The
All England Club appeared to be pressured into a U-turn, with the hill 
remaining open during yesterday’s rain – heavier and more persistent 
than Monday’s.

Yet 
chief executive Ian Ritchie said he and his officials were ‘staggered, 
flabbergasted and amazed’ that Mrs Hackitt should get involved.
