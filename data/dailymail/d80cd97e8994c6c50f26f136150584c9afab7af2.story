Liam Stewart, the son of rock star Rod Stewart and former model Rachel Hunter, has moved a step closer to making his senior Great Britain debut.

The 20-year-old, born in London, has been included in new head coach Pete Russell's initial 31-man party which will then be cut to 23 for next month's World Championships in Holland.

Stewart plays his hockey in America for Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League and has already represented Britain at Under-20 level.

He is now in his fourth season with the Washington-based Chiefs, being an assistant captain for the last two years, after previously impressing for the Los Angeles Junior Kings Under-16s.

Stewart is one of eight former U20 players looking for their first senior appearance with Josh Batch, James Griffin, Matt Haywood, Tom Murdy, Sam Oakford, Jack Prince and Joey Lewis also included.

Jonathan Boxill, Chris Blight and Sam McCluskey will be aiming for their first Britain cap too while Russell Cowley and Craig Peacock return to the squad, with Matty Davies and David Clarke sidelined through injury.

Russell said: 'Over the last three or so months we have watched a lot of hockey across the leagues and been in contact with lots of different hockey people in the UK, mainland Europe and USA.

'We have the final 31 and it's the right players and people. They all deserve their place and it's an exciting group to look at.

'The competition for the final 23 hots up now and that can only be good for every player, as well as each team at this important stage of the season.

'People say it's a tough job, yes it is, but it's a great problem as a coach to have good players to select from. As the clock ticks down I get more excited each day till April and Eindhoven.'

After two warm-up matches against Poland, Britain head to Eindhoven for their Division 1B campaign where they will face Holland, Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania and South Korea between April 13-19.
