Total number of London theatre-goers last year – 22 million.

Total attendance at Premier League matches last season – 13.94 million.

The after-party has been as embarrassing and depressing as the World Cup performance.

Las Vegas has become the go-to destination for failed England footballers and it was along that gaudy Strip that Jack Wilshere chose to commemorate his putrid contribution on the great stage of Brazil 2014.

Once our great white hope, now our big white dope, Wilshere drowned his and the nation’s sorrows by drinking and smoking in a casino’s swimming pool.

Joe Hart, who kept goal against Luis Suarez like a petrified rabbit, saw fit to join Wilshere in the company of boozy hangers-on and girls hanging out of their bikinis.

Each to his own way of grieving, I suppose.

Most in this country were caught in a confusion of shock and mourning after the quickest and most humiliating World Cup finals exit in England’s history.

To his credit, the captain has had the decency to retire from the international game.

One of the few to have worn the white shirt with distinction in recent years, Steven Gerrard honestly admitted he was on his last legs in Brazil. Not that he was the only Englishman left flagging in the slipstream of football’s high-speed development at this tournament.

Inadvertently, however, Gerrard has been equally frank about the limitations of the domestic game which finds itself burdened with rekindling public interest in our national sport after its thorough World Cup dowsing.

Gerrard reveals that this was biting advice to Suarez as he pondered his transfer to Barcelona: ‘I told him not to go to Arsenal. With all due respect to them, he is too good for Arsenal.’

Swansong: Ashley Cole heads to Roma

With those few words he exposed the delusional notion of the Premier League as the greatest in the world.

Arsenal are one of the big five clubs in England. They qualify for the Champions League as regularly as that giant clock high behind one goal at the Emirates ticks off each unforgiving minute without a goal.

Yet in the estimation of one of the iconic figures of our football they are not worthy of signing a truly world-class goal-scorer, even though he is psychologically flawed.

That will come as interesting reading to Chile’s national hero Alexis Sanchez as he travels in the reverse direction, from Barcelona to Arsenal, in contradiction of the trend for most of the stars at this World Cup to move anywhere other than England.

English footballers – with the exception of veterans like Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard as they venture in search of a last hurrah – shuffle between our own teams.

So much of a muchness are they that a club like Southampton can sell off a whole bunch of its first team players and still express confidence that an incoming job-lot of cheap signings and an upsurge of youngsters will be good enough for another season of Premier League survival.

Depressingly, they are probably right.

Worryingly, by cherry-picking those they perceive to be the most Saintly, Liverpool may turn into the next Tottenham – even as their resurgence has just carried them closer to the Premier League title than for many a season.

Spurs thought mistakenly that it would be good business to spend the fortune Real Madrid paid them for Gareth Bale on a half a team of average players. Now Liverpool are doing the same with the Suarez money.

Perhaps they are right that Rickie Lambert has a few goals left in his aging legs. Perhaps not.

As for Adam Lallana, his mundane efforts in Brazil came as little surprise to those of us who saw pictures of him posing with his underpants exposed, as well as a grotesque tattoo.

Given that this vain posturing was in inverse proportion to the way in he floundered out of his depth at the World Cup it is hard to resist the conclusion that here, as with Wilshere, is yet another young English footballer who is under the premature misconception that he is already a superstar.

Since he will be injured for some weeks, we will have to wait to see whether Lallana can justify his £25million fee.

Don't believe the hype: Adam Lallana cost Liverpool £25m yet does he already think he's a superstar?

Not that he was alone among over-hyped youngsters who found themselves overwhelmed in Brazil.

Defensively sound? Luke Shaw

Danny Welbeck never recovered from a poor start. Jordan Henderson was pedestrian. Luke Shaw, when his chance came, looked like another in the succession of left backs who are good going forward but dodgy at defending. Even Raheem Sterling disappeared after a bright beginning against what we came to realise was an Italian team almost as pathetic as England.

The declining quality of the English footballer is playing into the descent of the Premier League. It is having a negative effect on the quality of the imports.

Spain, Germany, France in the case of Paris Saint-Germain, even Italy now that Serie A is enjoying a renaissance, have taken over as the destinations of choice for the world class footballer.

When the public discern more drama, entertainment and excitement on the London stage than at football’s theatres of dreams, the Premier League find itself caught somewhere between slipping into the wings and turning itself into a circus of cheap commercial thrills.

And as its false idols admire themselves so narcissistically in the mirror, they may care to reflect on another revealing pair of statistics.

Only one actor in every 50 on the London stage earns more than £20,000 a year.

Average salary of the Premier League player - £31,000 a week.

Jose Mourinho’s sanity was questioned when he sold David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain and Juan Mata to Manchester United, while tempting Everton into paying a club record fee for Romelu Lukaku by lending him to them even though he seemed to need a goal-scorer at Chelsea.

How the World Cup has proved the Special One right.

Would PSG still have lavished £50m on Luiz after seeing his catastrophic performances for Brazil? Highly doubtful.

Lukaku, only in the Belgian team because of injury to others, was dropped after an utterly ineffective first game and remained on the bench thereafter. Yet Everton have still shelled out £28m.

Great bit of business: Romelu Lukaku joined Everton to boost Chelsea's coffers to the tune of £28m

Mata, did well enough at Old Trafford to grab a last minute plane ticket to Brazil but was left out of Spain’s team for the first two matches of their disastrous world title defence. Even then he was still only recalled as late substitute during their dead rubber third game. A meaningless goal in that match was hardly retrospective justification for a giant fee – but United’s £37m was already in Mourinho’s transfer chest.

Along with all his marbles.

The Glazer family are attempting to sell another multi-million pound chunk of their holding in Manchester United, after their appointment of Louis van Gaal revived the previously ailing share price.

Which begs one awkward question: do the American owners not fully share the faith of the market in Van Gaal being the Dutch Sir Alex Ferguson?
