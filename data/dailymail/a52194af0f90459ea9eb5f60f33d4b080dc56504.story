Ukraine's defence ministry accused Russia of shooting down two of its military fighter jets today, as the International Committee of the Red Cross declared a civil war in the country.

Kiev's National and Security Council, which also warned of a major new build-up of Kremlin forces on its borders, said: 'The rockets were launched from Russian territory.'

The Red Cross designation means both sides could face prosecution for war crimes in the conflict.

'Fighting in eastern Ukraine continues to take its toll
on civilians, and we urge all sides to comply with international humanitarian
law, otherwise known as the law of armed conflict,' said ICRC director of
operations Dominik Stillhart said in a statement.

'These rules and principles apply to all parties to the
non-international armed conflict in Ukraine, and impose restrictions on the
means and methods of warfare that they may use.'

The latest 
attack comes less than a week after 298 civilians were killed when a 
surface to air missile blew Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 out of the 
sky.

That attack has been blamed on 
pro-Russian rebels based in the east of Ukraine, but they have denied 
having any involvement in the disaster.

Rebels yesterday boasted they had shot down the fighters
from territory they occupy inside Ukraine.Â 

The two Sukhoi-25 fighters were shot down 1:30 p.m. local time today over a rebel-held area called Savur Mogila.

Defence Ministry spokesman Oleksiy Dmitrashkovsky said the planes may have been carrying up to two crew members each.

The
 area in which the attack took place is around 20 miles south of the 
village of Hrabove - where the majority of the wreckage from MH17 is 
scattered.

It
 is also only around five miles south of the towns of Snizhne and Torez,
 where photographs and videos posted online appear to show mobile BUK 
missile launchers stationed early last week.

The
 images are not clear enough to tell whether they show the same launcher
 in both towns, but they have led experts to believe the missile that 
took down MH17 was fired from somewhere in the area.

News
 of the two fighter jets being shot down comes as the first bodies of 
those killed in the MH17 massacre were transported to the Netherlands 
after they left Ukraine on a cargo plane.
