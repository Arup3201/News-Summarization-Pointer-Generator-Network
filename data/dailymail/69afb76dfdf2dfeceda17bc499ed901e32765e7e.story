At 106 Betty Lowe refuses to let the cold weather and her failing eyesight stop her from keeping the Girl Guide promise she took almost a century ago to do all she can to help others.

And now Britain's oldest Girl Guide has received the ultimate accolade - an honour from Prime Minister David Cameron.

The centenarian is still volunteering and will be given a Point of Light Award, which recognises those who make an exceptional difference to their community.

And she shows no signs of stopping, saying the award is a 'big honour.' 

Betty Lowe says she has no plans to retire and has been rewarded for her work in the community, which has seen her volunteering to help others for almost 100 years since she joined Girl Guides in 1919 at age 11 (right)

'I have no plans to retire,' said Ms Lowe.

'My sight isn't very good, but I can use my hands. As long as I can keep volunteering, I will.' 

Ms Lowe joined the Girl Guides in 1919 when she was 11 and is still a member. 

She is currently volunteering at a cafe at Salford Royal Hospital with the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS), which she joined more than 40 years ago.

She added: 'I really enjoy volunteering. I would be lost if I didn't come to the hospital to volunteer.

'It's something to occupy my mind. I enjoy the company and you meet people here who you would not normally meet.

After 95 years as a Girl Guide the pensioner now volunteers at a cafe at Salford hospital once a week

'It keeps me from being lonely and I don't like being lonely.

'There might be one or two days in winter when I can't come, but I won't let anything stop me.'

The Point of Light is not Ms Lowe's first award, as she was honoured with an MBE in 86.

Ms Lowe has vowed not to let anything stop her 

She added: 'This award is a big honour for me. It's nice to know that other people are thinking of me.'

Ms Lowe, who never married, volunteers at the hospital once a week, providing company and support for elderly patients and visitors.

She worked her way up from Girl Guide leader to become Vice President of Girlguiding in Greater Manchester West.

She also trained leaders and promoted the growth of the guide movement in Salford.

Mr Cameron said: 'Betty is an incredible woman, who has dedicated her life to volunteering. 

As an RVS volunteer for 40 years and as a Guide for 95 years, Betty has lived and breathed serving others.'

The pensioner is believed to be Salford's oldest resident.  

Hazel Blears, MP for Salford and Eccles, said: 'I know everyone in Salford will be thrilled her hard work has been recognised at the highest level.

'She's a real inspiration.'
