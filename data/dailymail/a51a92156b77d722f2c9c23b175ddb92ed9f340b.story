James Milner is learning Spanish so that he can communicate with Manchester City team-mates such as David Silva and Sergio Aguero - and manager Manuel Pellegrini.

The England midfielder has been having the lessons for the last couple of years, revealed his former City colleague Micah Richards.

It is a very different approach to the one taken in the red half of Manchester, where Louis van Gaal is ordering his Spanish-speaking stars such as Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao to learn English.

Richards, who signed for Serie A side Fiorentina this summer, told the Guardian that at City: 'Vincent Kompany tried to speak to the boys at one point and said they had to learn English but there are so many Spaniards and South Americans they just slip into their own language.

'James Milner has actually been having Spanish lessons for a couple of years.'

Richards is going to learn Italian so he can communicate with his new team-mates, adding: 'I do want to interact properly. It's too easy to stick to English and I always wanted to learn another language anyway.'
