A new morning TV battle got underway today as ITV launched Good Morning Britain - and while there was initial dismay at Susanna Reid's legs being hidden behind a desk, one media commentator believes the BBC should be worried about its latest rival to Breakfast.

Good Morning Britain's predecessor, Daybreak, was viewed by roughly half the number of people that tuned into BBC Breakfast, so ITV has a lot of ground to make up.

But media analyst Steve Hewlett believes it stands a fighting chance of succeeding, not least because of its poaching of Ms Reid from Breakfast.

He told 
MailOnline: 'This is a major throw of the dice - there's a new 
production team and new presenters. It's a major move, but on paper it 
stands every chance of working. Susanna Reid is a great booking.

'The question is whether Good Morning Britain gets to know its audience and whether it gets the right tone.'

Mr Hewlett said that arrogance was the cause of Daybreak's failure.

He said: 'With Daybreak corporate hubris took over at ITV. In one fell swoop they demonstrated everything that can go wrong in one show. They hired Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley, an amazing partnership on The One Show, but transplanting chemistry from one place to another is very hard to do.'

He added: 'It would be really good, not least for the BBC, if ITV manage to make a success of Good Morning Britain, because if it gets traction the BBC will be forced to react. Not having competition is not good for the viewer.'

Ms Reid’s ITV debut initially drew mixed reactions, with criticism that 
the show looked too similar to its U.S counterpart and that Ms Reid’s 
figure was obscured by a desk.

As
 the show began viewers took to Twitter to complain that the legs of the
 43-year-old - whose pay for the role has been reported as £400,000 and 
as much as £1million a year - were hidden from view.

One
 viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to
 put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the 
garage #gmb.'

Another wrote: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.'

The dismay was short-lived, though, as Ms Reid, dressed in a knee-length red dress, soon moved to a sofa.

Speaking recently about the desk and the new set of the show, Susanna said: 'Our set is different, fresh and it's not what people have been used to over the last couple of years in breakfast television.

'It is something new and exciting for us. We all start behind the desk, which hasn't happened for a while.'

Criticism that the show’s studio and layout resembled ABC’s Good Morning America may take longer to shake off.

One viewer wrote on Twitter: 'Good morning Britain is too formal and newsy and like an American morning show. #GMB.'

While another added: 'Well, Good Morning Britain looks very American so far...suited team behind desks, tickers, huge pic takes up half screen.'

Sky News anchor Kay Burley told MailOnline that she found the show - co-hosted by Ben Shephard, 39, Charlotte Hawkins, 28 and Sean Fletcher, 30 - too frantic.

The presenter, who was a reporter on Good Morning Britain's distant cousin, TV-am, in 1985, said: ‘The show itself is just too busy for me at the moment but I'm sure it'll settle down after a couple of weeks.

‘Breakfast viewers just need to know that the world is still turning, they can get to work on time and what the weather is doing...'

But she added: ‘I love Susanna. I think she has all the ingredients a great presenter needs. Smart, presentable, serious when she needs to be and fun when she doesn't.’

Monday’s viewing figures for BBC Breakfast and Good Morning Britain will be released tomorrow.

On average 12.4m people watch Breakfast each week, according to the BBC.

Bookmaker William Hill believes there is a fair chance Reid may not be with the show in a year's time, with even money on the presenter no longer being a host 12 months from now.

Spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'You would expect the first day to be a little chaotic, but we felt the chemistry was not there and the show could struggle in its current format.'

Susanna sneaked out the back of ITV's studio on the South Bank over an hour after filming finished and was driven out in a black Mercedes.

She Tweeted: 'Thanks for all your tweets #GoodMorningBritain - back tomorrow at 6am.'
