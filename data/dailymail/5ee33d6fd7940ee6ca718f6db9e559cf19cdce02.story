Gary Cahill was lucky to stay on the pitch during Chelsea's surprise 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on New Year's Day, after  kicking out at Harry Kane.

With the score at 4-2 the England defender was tussling for the ball with Spurs' two-goal hero when the striker fell to the floor.

Cahill, who had earlier conceded a penalty for fouling Kane, took a swing at the forward, clattering him in the back.

With the ball a good yard away it is difficult to see how Cahill could claim to have been attempting to play it, particularly with Kane's whole body between the defender and the ball.

Cahill then appeared to stamp on the prone forward's leg, although that was at least closer to the ball, and could have been an attempt to retrieve it.

However, referee Phil Dowd seems not to have seen the incident, failing to punish the centre half for the violent play.

However, Cahill's reprieve did his side little good, as Nacer Chadli added a fifth goal to Kane's double, Danny Rose's strike and Andros Townsend's penalty. 

Kane reacts in obvious pain, but neither the referee or his assistant seemed to notice the offence

After the incident Cahill, apparently repentent, checked that his opponent was not seriously hurt
