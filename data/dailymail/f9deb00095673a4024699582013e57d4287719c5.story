Customs and health officials at airports in Washington, Chicago, Atlanta and  New Jersey, are scheduled to start taking the temperatures of passengers from three West African countries as part of a stepped-up Ebola screening program.

Federal health officials say the entry screenings that start on Thursday add another layer of protection to halt the spread of the Ebola virus that has killed thousands. 

Screeners will use no-touch thermometers to try to find passengers with fevers.

Passengers mingle in the arrivals area at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Saturday after health screening procedures were put in place at the airport. So far 91 people were pinpointed - none had a fever but five were sent for further evaluation, according to CDC

The screenings started at New York's Kennedy International Airport on Saturday. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that screenings will start on Thursday at Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, Newark's Liberty and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta.

Using infrared temperature guns, staff are checking for elevated temperatures among passengers whose journeys began or included a stop in one of the three African countries. 

Customs officials reported about 150 people travel daily from or through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to the U.S.

Nearly 95 percent of these travelers land first at one of those five airports.

Those countries have seen most of the deaths from the outbreak, which has claimed more than 4,000 lives.

However Republican Representative Tim Murphy said today during a congressional hearing on Ebola that the screening processes are flawed because people can mask symptoms with Ibuprofen or simply avoid the airports which have installed screenings.  

The screenings are being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP), under direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

CBP staff will identify passengers to screen by looking at trip information and checking passports.

On Monday, CDC director Dr Tom Frieden reported that 91 passengers at JFK were pinpointed as having a risk of being infected with Ebola.

No passenger was found to have a fever but five were sent for further evaluation.

Ebola patient Thomas Duncan landed in Dallas on September 20 after traveling from his home in Monrovia, Liberia. He also traveled through Brussels Airport in Belgium and Washington-Dulles.

The 42-year-old Liberian national was not contagious while he traveled.  

Mr Duncan died last Wednesday after being treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.
