Surrey have released former England batsman Kevin Pietersen.

His contract at The Oval ended on August 30, which in theory leaves the former England batsman free to negotiate a deal with another club.

The 34-year-old is scheduled to have further talks with Surrey at the end of the year about a possible return next summer but there is little chance of them employing him.

Pietersen has a new book out next week in which he is going to give his version of his sacking by England earlier this year.

His release by Surrey comes after a disappointing summer in which he seemed to be more preoccupied with off-field matters.

Pietersen will now look to play in lucrative Twenty20 competitions across the world, including the Indian Premier League and the Big Bash in Australia.
