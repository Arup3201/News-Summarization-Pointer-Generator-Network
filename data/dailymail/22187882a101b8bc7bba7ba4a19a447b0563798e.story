Glen Johnson insists Liverpool must swiftly put defeat by Real Madrid behind them in order to preserve their Champions League status.

Liverpool face a daunting assignment in the Bernabeu in 12 days and many will envisage the reigning champions handing out another emphatic lesson to match Wednesday night’s comprehensive 3-0 triumph.

Brendan Rodgers’ side, though, are still odds-on with some bookmakers to reach the last 16 of the competition thanks, in part, to the fact Ludogorets beat Basle 1-0 in Sofia, leaving the three teams behind Real all on three points.

After the trip to Spain next month, Liverpool must travel to Sofia on November 26 before wrapping up Group B with a home game against Basle and Johnson knows it is imperative that his side start winning to ensure they qualify for the knockout stages.

Johnson said: ‘This is past us now. We move on to the next game now and we have to start picking up three points.

‘Games don’t come bigger. The atmosphere was fantastic and the crowd was there for us until the end. That was great to be a part of and great to see. These are the games that you want to be involved in. They are a top side and they showed that in the first half.

‘Yeah (we kept them out in the second half) but it was just one of them. We didn’t want to open up too much, go out thinking that we could win the game 4-3 and end up conceding more. We had to play for our pride in the second half. I think we did that.’

Jordan Henderson, meanwhile, says it is crucial Liverpool’s defending improves. They have only kept one clean sheet all season and while Cristiano Ronaldo’s opener was of the highest calibre, Karim Benzema was not over-extended to score Madrid’s other goals.

‘We felt as though we were in the game and probably the better team,’ said Liverpool’s vice-captain. 

'Going forward we were doing well and we were defending well. But they came up with a bit of class for the opening goal and from them on we struggled to get going again.

‘They dominated until half-time. Their first goal was top drawer. Sometimes you have to give credit to the opposition. For me, Ronaldo is the best player in the world. Big players in big games do big things.

‘It was an outstanding finish but the other goals were a bit sloppy on our behalf. This Real Madrid team is top class with the best players in the world. That’s who you want to be playing against and testing yourself against in order to improve as a team.’
