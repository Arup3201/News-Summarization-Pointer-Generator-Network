Apple reportedly paid as little as $83 million tax in Australia last year despite racking up more than $6 billion through sales of its products - a tax bill which works out to just 0.01 per cent of the massive revenue.

In figures provided by the global giant's Australian arm to the nation's corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, Apple shows its tax bill for the year ending September 27 has doubled from the previous 12 months.

The revelations come as the Federal Government prepares to crack down on corporates' profits and prices.

But Apple Australia, which has upwards of 3000 employees, told Daily Mail Australia only that 'we don't release details of what (tax) we pay but we are paying all taxes which are due' but would not be making any other comment on the controversy.

However, DMA understands that the tech giant will defend itself against any suggestions it's minimising tax - by pointing to miscalculations by its critics of the Income Tax Expense included in its report to ASIC. That is a complex equation, which includes the amount of expense a business recognises in an accounting period for the government tax related to its taxable profit

It comes as the Australian Tax Office is reportedly set to undertake audits against local companies and major multinational corporations in an ongoing probe into profit shifting, a list which is believed to include up to 25 international technology groups.

And according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, Apple is likely to be one of the organisations to be called before a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance.

Apple Australia says 'we don't release details of what (tax) we pay but we are paying all taxes which are due' 

Meantime, Labor MP Ed Husic is a member of a parliamentary inquiry investigating alleged price gouging by tech companies, hit out at the results in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.

'It’s simply staggering to see Apple make more money but manage to pay less tax in Australia,' he said.

'When you consider the massive overcharging that has occurred with some of their products, it seems both Australian consumers and taxpayers are shouldering a heavy load to fund Apple’s bottom line.' 

Dr Antony Ting from the University of Sydney Business School says that 'roughly almost 40 per cent of what we pay for an Apple product in Australia is never taxed anywhere in the world'

Dr Antony Ting is the University of Sydney Business School senior lecturer in Taxation Law.

He explained the system Apple uses as part of its global tax structure, to minimise tax.

'Imagine if I pay $600 for an iPad in Australia, $550 is paid to Apple Ireland - that means very little profit is left to be taxed in Australia,' Dr Ting said

'To make it worse, out of the $550 paid to Ireland, $220 is never taxed anywhere in the world.

'In other words, roughly almost 40 per cent of what we pay for an Apple product in Australia is never taxed anywhere in the world.

'One important point to note is that Apple's tax structure is perfectly legal.

'That means we need a serious re-think of the international tax rules for the taxation of company groups.'

Apple Inc. has recorded staggering results, including revenue of US$74 billion in the last three months of 2014, selling about 34,000 iPhones every hour

Globally, Apple Inc. has recorded staggering results, including revenue of US$74 billion in the last three months of 2014 - generating profit of $18 billion on the back of the new iPhone's popularity.

'Demand for iPhone has been staggering, shattering out high expectations,' said Apple CEO Tim Cook.

'This volume is hard to comprehend.

'We sold about 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24/7 for the entire quarter.

'We have sold over a billion devices running iOS.'

He also confirmed the firm's plan for Apple Watch were on track.

'Development for Apple watch is right on schedule, and we intend to begin shipping in April,' he said.

'We can't wait for customers to experience it.

'My expectations are very high, I use it every day, love it and can't live without it.'
