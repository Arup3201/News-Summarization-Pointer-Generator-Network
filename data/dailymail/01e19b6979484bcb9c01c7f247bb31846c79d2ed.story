In my online Q&A this morning there was a lot of focus on poor performances in the Champions League but also on the current state of defending in the Premier League. One question in particular got me thinking:

Arsenal were awful in defence again against Anderlecht. But are there any good centre backs any more? I bet you can’t name 10 really good ones in the Premier League!

You’re right, Emma. I can’t! At the moment I can only really think of five defenders in the Premier League who are in good form, and even they are often dependent on their team-mates in front of them.

JOHN TERRY & GARY CAHILL

Terry is still such a reliable force for Chelsea and enjoying life again under Jose Mourinho. He has been important in the development of Cahill who I now feel is the most important player in the Chelsea back four. He has an excellent combination of mobility and physicality but he reads the game so well. They make a formidable pair and are a large part of Chelsea’s success this season. 

But even they can be troubled if they don’t get the proper amount of midfield protection. Crystal Palace were able to isolate them and when they did, Fraizer Campbell went past Cahill – the most consistent defender in the league – as if he wasn’t even there. That shows the importance of defending as a team.

JOSE FONTE & TOBY ALDERWEIRELD

Maya Yoshida started as Fonte’s primary partner but now Alderweireld, on loan from Atletico Madrid, has taken his place. Between them they have conceded just five goals in the league. Only Bayern Munich (three) and Barcelona and Juventus (both four) have conceded fewer this season. Not bad for a side who were supposed to be relegated! 

Under Ronald Koeman they are well drilled, they deal with crosses well and they are competent in possession. As individuals they may not stand out but with either Victor Wanyama or Morgan Schneiderlin dropping in to cover, they work well within an effective system.

WINSTON REID

West Ham are in form and Winston Reid has been solid in their defence. James Collins and James Tomkins have been good but Reid is the most impressive member of their back line. Even then he has mostly just been getting the basics right rather than doing anything spectacular as an individual. West Ham are flying as a team, which always helps any defence, but Reid has been compact and consistent.

Winston Reid is solid and not spectacular but is enjoying a fine season for West Ham 

It is a defender’s responsibility to help shape and set up the team in front of him. You have to help build that barricade. If a midfielder is charging forward, you need to have words and make sure he does his job, otherwise you can be left exposed. You have to be prepared to open your mouth and ask for some help.

I fell out with Lee Dixon on a few occasions at Arsenal when we disagreed about our positioning. But it was always over in a flash and we respected each other for being brave enough to speak up. I’d like to see defenders demand more from those around them.

Even Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany is not playing at his best this season 

If you are under pressure, you need to make sure gaps in front of you are filled and the game settles otherwise you’re in danger of letting the momentum change. That’s what happened against Anderlecht – Arsenal gave away the impetus and they were punished.

Every team these days is stocked with players capable of embarrassing you, not just the top sides. It’s up to you as a defender to want to keep them out more than they want to score.

Good defending is all linked to your mentality and your desire. A lot of players spend time doing weights to build up their strength, but that inner strength doesn’t come from the gym.

You need an attitude of: I want to win. I want to clear every ball and win every battle. If you want it badly enough all over the pitch then you create that physical energy, which makes you look more powerful than you are.

If you’ve got that hunger and drive then it becomes infectious. You just need to let your team-mates know you expect them to back you up.
