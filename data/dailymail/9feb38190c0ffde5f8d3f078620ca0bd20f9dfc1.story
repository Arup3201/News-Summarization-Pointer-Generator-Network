Britons have enjoyed an extra hour in bed as the clocks went back to mark the end of summertime today.

At 2am, clocks were wound back to 1am as Greenwich Mean Time returned. The change spells darker evenings until they are put forward again in March next year.

The Daylight Saving Bill was introduced in 1916 by the House of Commons.

For some, it brings a heady excitement that Christmas is just a few short shopping weeks away.

For others, it heralds months of doom and gloom until we see the sun again.

Debating the effects of turning the clocks back has been a British pastime for more than a century, when the first Daylight Saving Bill was brought before the House of Commons.

During the Second World War the Government moved the clocks forward one hour to help munitions factories maximise productivity and allow people to get home safely before the blackout.

Between 1968 and 1971 the Government carried out the same experiment but was forced to end it after complaints in Scotland and northern England.

The Daylight Saving Bill was introduced in 1916 by the House of Commons.

Plans have also been mooted to move to Central European Time - something that would mean lighter winter evenings, which supporters claim would cut road deaths, boost tourism and reduce energy use.

But the proposals have faced opposition from many in Scotland who do not relish the prospect of an extra hour of darkness in the morning.

Clocks should have been put back 60 minutes at 2am this morning as the UK reverted to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
