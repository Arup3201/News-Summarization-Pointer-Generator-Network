A couple were jailed yesterday for a brutal attack on the daughter they felt had shamed them by dating a black man.

David and Frances Champion repeatedly punched Jane in the face and shouted racist abuse while kicking her boyfriend out of the family home.

They lost control after they returned home to find their 17-year-old daughter in a ‘state of undress’ with Alfonce Ncube, a court heard.

Assaulted by her parents: Jane Champion was hit and punched in the face by her father and mother for having a relationship with a black man

Racial abuse: Boyfriend Aflonce Ncube was subjected to racial abuse and physical assault from Jane's parents because of his race

After throwing the waiter out of the 
house, Mr Champion, 50, grabbed his daughter by her hair and started to 
hit her, said Nicola Powell, prosecuting.

‘He told her she was destroying the 
family and pushed her out of the door, Champion shouting racist language
 to describe Mr Ncube,’ she added.

Jane went to stay with her grandmother
 but returned to her parents in St Thomas, Swansea, once the situation 
had apparently calmed down.

But a month later her parents challenged her over Mr Ncube when they returned from a pub.

‘David Champion asked his daughter if 
she was still seeing Mr Ncube. When she told him she was, he punched her
 in the face,’ said Miss Powell.

‘Miss Champion said she felt huge pain
 to her left eye but her father then grabbed her by the throat and 
continued hitting her.’

Mrs Champion, 47, then began hitting 
her daughter – causing swelling on her face and lumps on her head – 
yelling abuse at the teenager saying: ‘You deserve it. It is all your 
fault.’ Swansea Crown Court was told Mrs Champion said her daughter had 
‘brought shame on her family’.

The couple then went in search of Mr Ncube at the Swansea restaurant where he worked.

When they were removed from the 
premises Mrs Champion continued to bang on the restaurant window. John 
Hipkin, defending her husband, said his client knew that it was an 
‘abhorrent’ assault, adding: ‘It’s not excusable in any way, shape or 
form.

‘But the circumstances in which he found his young daughter meant he reacted in a terrible way. Lessons have been learned.’

Georgina Buckley, defending Mrs 
Champion, said: ‘She accepts her actions were fuelled by alcohol and 
that she confronted her daughter in a wholly unacceptable and disgusting
 way.

‘She is remorseful and her daughter has sent her a text message before the court hearing wishing her well.’

Jailed for the 'vile' attack: Father David Champion (right) was sentenced to 12 months in jail and mother Frances (left) to nine months after punching and hitting their 17-year-old daughter and kicking her boyfriend

Judge Peter Heywood told the couple: ‘Your behaviour was disgraceful and you used vile language.

‘We live in a liberal and enlightened 
society and these sorts of racist behaviour cannot be tolerated. The way
 you reacted was totally inappropriate.

‘I would be failing in my public duty if I was to do anything other than impose a custodial sentence.’

Mr Champion was sentenced to 12 months in prison and his wife to nine months. Both admitted assaulting their daughter.

Mr Champion also pleaded guilty to a racially aggravated assault against Mr Ncube and his wife admitted a racial abuse charge.

'You deserve it': Jane was punched in the face by her father after admitting she was still dating Mr Ncube. Her mother also hit her, saying 'you deserve it. It is all your fault.'

The couple have another daughter, who is 12.

The court heard that Mr Ncube suffered a dead leg in the first attack after being kicked by Mr Champion.

Jane, who is studying sports science 
at college, suffered bleeding from her ear in the second attack at the 
hands of her mother. She met Mr Ncube at the college and the pair have 
been dating for two years. He moved from his native Zimbabwe to Southend
 in Essex when he was eight.

Miss Champion said her parents had apologised for their actions and she had forgiven them.

She told the Mail: ‘I have seen my 
parents a few times since they were arrested and they are very sorry for
 what they did. I don’t know why they did it. Alfie and I love each 
other very much.’

Her parents originally pleaded not guilty to charges in two earlier appearances but later changed their plea to avoid a trial.

Speaking outside the family’s terraced
 house on a quiet street in Swansea, a relative said they wanted to 
reunite Jane with her parents.

The family spokesman said: ‘We’re 
trying to get the family back together again. We are working on getting 
Jane and her parents back speaking.

‘It’s been a terrible case for everyone involved. Now we just want to put it all behind us.’.
