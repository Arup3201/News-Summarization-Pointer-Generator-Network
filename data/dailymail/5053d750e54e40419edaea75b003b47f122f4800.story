A man had admitted scrawling 'Lee Rigby's killers should hang' on one of Britain's most prominent war memorials after the soldier's death - without realising what the memorial was.

Daniel James Smith, 21, daubed the green graffiti on the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in central London's Green Park.

Smith also wrote 'EDL', known as an acronym for the English Defence League, and 'F*** the police' on the memorial, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.

'Offence to many': Daniel Smith, 21, admitted daubing green graffiti saying 'Lee Rigby's killers should hang' on the RAF Bomber Command Memorial - without realising it was a tribute to more than 55,000 war dead

But the court heard he had 'no idea' of the significance of Bomber Command, which was unveiled by the Queen last year in memory of more than 55,000 fallen airmen.

Colleen Gildernew, defending, said: 'He had no idea that the war memorial was a war memorial.

'He is very disgusted with himself, even more so because of that.'

The court heard Smith, of Grecian Street North, Salford, had 44 previous convictions - many of them for shoplifting - and has appeared in different courts five times this year.

He had applied for a
 job in the British Army but was unsuccessful 'because of his 
convictions as a young boy'.

Ms Gildernew added the experiences of 
Smith’s two army friends - one who lost both legs and another who suffered memory loss from a bomb blast - had an 'emotional 
impact on him'.

The court heard Smith, had planned to attend Fusilier Rigby’s funeral but because he was arrested he could not go. 

The graffiti, shown before it was covered up, read 'Lee Rigby's killers should hang'. Daniel Smith, from Salford, admitted defacing the memorial, which only opened last year. The man pictured is unrelated to the case

District Judge Quentin Purdy described the content of the graffiti inflicted on June 5 by Smith, and its location, as 'highly emotive'.

He added Smith’s actions clearly challenged the 'tolerance we all seek to see in society'.

Judge Purdy said people would want to know what the court is doing about people, 'brains in gear or not', who inflict such damage.

The court was told Smith has 
spent the past 11 weeks in Feltham Young Offenders’ Institution and was 
released only yesterday.

Judge Purdy said he would explore all options to avoid returning Smith to jail, but added 'there may be no alternative' to a prison sentence.

He told Smith his punishment should 'reflect the public’s concern about your criminal conduct', adding Smith's actions 'caused offence to many'.

He added it was 'slightly worrying' that Smith was released with few arrangements in place.

Ms Gildernew said Smith was brought up by his grandmother and had little in terms of family support, describing his childhood as 'unsettled'.

The court heard he left school at the age of 15 with no qualifications, battled cannabis addiction in his teenage years and struggled with homelessness.

Ms Gildernew said Smith, dressed in a colourful T-shirt, was 'shaking and very tearful' before the hearing.

The damage to the memorial amounted to £870, the court heard.

Smith also pleaded guilty to causing £510 of criminal damage to a wall of a commercial property in Knightsbridge.

The graffiti was one of two incidents of vandalism to the memorial following the death of Fusilier Rigby, whose killing in Woolwich, London, on May 22 shocked the nation.

The capital also saw a number of attacks on Islamic centres and mosques.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, from Romford, and Michael Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich, have pleaded not guilty to Fusilier Rigby's murder and are due to stand trial from November 18.

Smith was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on Tuesday.
