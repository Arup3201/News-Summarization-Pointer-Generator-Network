Australia's  property market is continuously booming, with house prices soaring through the roof - but unfortunately for prospective property buyers, it's showing no sign of slowing down.

An auction of a quaint, unrenovated Surry Hills home on Saturday reaped surprising bids, with the owner of the property managing to bag a whooping $1.5 million for the home, which didn't even have a bathroom and had holes in the ceiling. 

On the same day, a stunning beachfront home, owned by former TV comedian John 'Strop' Cornell, in the stylish area of Belongil in Byron Bay was picked up by Harvey Norman heir Glen Norman for $10 million.

So why are Australia's house prices so extortionate and can we expect more of this in the future?

According to Director at LJ Hooker, Brigitte Blackman, low interest prices are pushing up real estate prices and mixed with a lack of stock on the market, things are only set to get worse.

'While we have cheap money, people will just extend themselves,' Ms Blackman told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Also there’s very low stock on the market, which I haven’t seen in a long time at this time of year. 

'With low stock levels and lowest interest rates ever - which are projected to go down further - moneys cheap and real estates such a solid investment that people are spending big and wanting to buy, but there’s not much to buy,' she said. 

The house had holes in the ceiling and didn't even have a kitchen 

14 registered buyers turned out for the auction and each battling it out to but the house

About 700 homes went under the hammer in Sydney on Saturday and Domain Group put the clearance rate at 86.1 per cent, the second highest result on record.

Ms Blackman sold 22 Ridge St in Surry Hills on Saturday for $1.5 and said everyone was extremely surprised with the outcome, considering the reserve was set at $1.3 million.

There were between 80-100 people at the auction and astonishingly 14 buyers registered to bid. 

The dilapidated four-bedroom Surry Hills terrace was unrenovated with no kitchen, no bathroom and not even a toilet.

The home had been in the same family’s hands for more than 60 years, but was left in a state of neglect. 

Paint was peeling off the walls, holes littered the kitchen ceiling and and the garden was in some serious need of some tender loving care.

The house didn't have a bathroom, a toilet or a kitchen but was located in prime real estate 

Two other houses on the same street sold last year for less than this house, and they were both renovated 

However, what it lacked in amenities it made up for in location and buyers scrambled over themselves to be the one to scoop up the hot property.

'Surry Hills is probably one of the hottest suburbs in Sydney that people want to buy,' Ms Blackman said. 

'It was what I call a rough diamond. It had the right orientation, it’s faced north at the rear. There are only a few streets in Surry Hills that do face north at the rear so that was a big plus and it was unrenovated but very solid, it wasn't falling down. 

'It was raw, the potential was massive, it was a gem. Buyers saw that and we’re prepared to pay big dollars for it,' she said. 

This Byron Bay property was snapped up by Harvey Norman heir Glen Norman 

The stunning home is set right on the beach and is only accessible by a private path 

Two properties on the same street went up for auction last year and both were renovated. 

One sold for $1.45 million and the other for $1.55 million.

'This one didn't even have a kitchen and barely a bathroom so it was a big surprise,' Ms Blackman said. 

'We've got too much demand and low supply so unless the supply comes up it’s not going to meet the demand.

I've never heard buyers say to me: "There’s nothing else to see", generally they will say: "I've got five other’s to see today" -  and they’re not saying that right now.

Mr Norman bought the home from his former father-in-law John 'strop' Cornell

Glen Norman sold his Double Bay apartment for $4.5 million last week so he could move to Byron Bay 

'I think it’s a very interesting time, I've been selling for 20 years and I can’t recall another time like this. Noones ever seen these low interest rates before because they've never been this low in our country.'

Ms Blackman said she didn't know what was going to happen to the property market but she believes people are more interested in buying now, due to the high rent prices. 

'Money’s cheap so people are buying,' she said.

'If you were renting a property and you can afford to buy, why pay someone else’s rent when you can pay your own? That’s why there’s so many people in the market in my opinion.'

Further north in Byron Bay a stunning beachside home, formerly owned by comedian John 'Strop' Cornell was snapped off the market by his former son-in-law Glen Norman. 

Interestingly, Mr Norman's move to Byron Bay's seaside replicates that of his ex-wife, who only returned to live there last year after selling her Bronte home for $4.6 million

Melissa Cornell and Glen Norman were married in 1997 at her father's Beach Hotel but separated in 2004

Norman had listed his  his three-bedroom apartment in Double Bay earlier this month and was hoping to secure $4 million for the north-facing home, which he bought in 2008.

Last week, the Double Bay luxury apartment sold for $4.5 million.

They also sold their other two lots of land overlooking the beach, one for $2 million to Melbourne restaurateur Shannon Bennett and the other for $2.25 million to Bennett's business partner Adam Garrisson

Real estate agent Glen Irwin from LJ Hooker told Daily Mail Australia that they were expecting such a high price for the house, considering the sale price of previous lots in the area

Real estate agent Glen Irwin from LJ Hooker told Daily Mail Australia that they were expecting such a high price for the house, considering the sale price of previous lots in the area.   

'There are five paths there and lot one sold for $2.25 million and lot three sold for $2 million,' Mr Irwin said. 

'There is no road in front of it and it can only be accessed by path. Its an exclusive enclave of Byron Bay.'

Mr Irwin also stated that there was a lot of interest in the property but Mr Norman proposed the highest bid. 

The sale is just short of the Byron Bay record set in 2006 at $15.68 million, which was set my Mr Irwin

The stunning home is as private as you can get and there is no main road at the front of the house 

House prices in Byron Bay have always been high due to desirable location 

The sale is just short of the Byron Bay record set in 2006 at $15.68 million, which was set my Mr Irwin. 

The stunning home features a verandah overlooking beautiful Belongil Beach. 

The three-bedroom home features large floor to ceiling glass doors, showcasing the sweeping beach views from every angle of the living and dining areas, and bedrooms. 

A self-contained studio downstairs opens on to manicured lawns and gardens.

It also features stunning views of Cape Byron Light-house, Julian Rocks and Mt Warning.

However, in a complete turnaround, a 'gingerbread house' in Willoughby failed to sell under the hammer yesterday. 

The heritage-listed three-bedroom home at 105 Penshurst Street, which features enchanting gingerbread coloured bricks was left on the shelf, despite a lot of interest from buyers. 

'It's a hell of a result,' senior economist for the Domain Group, Andrew Wilson told Domain.

There were apparently 10 buyers registered to take part in the auction but unfortunately Auctioneer Mark Roberts had to work extremely hard to get even one bid from the crowd

'This is an extraordinarily confident market we are seeing right now, people have accelerated their buying decisions,' he said.

A sole bid of $1.4 million was issued but they then refused to negotiate on that figure. 

'We had so much interest in this property… until today!' Mr Roberts told the audience.
