Bill Cosby's friend of 60 years Tony Williams has defended the comedian after historic sexual assault allegations against him resurfaced.

The legendary saxophonist, who appeared on stage with the 77-year-old in September, said he was angry at the reappearance of the accusations because he thinks they are a lie. 

The 83-year-old said there were a lot of people looking for 'positive notoriety' in relation to the claims, suggesting the alleged victims were going after Cosby because of his fame and money.

His comments came as publicist and former actress Joan Tarshis became the latest woman to come forward, claiming she was attacked by Cosby in 1969.

She wrote in a Hollywood Elsewhere editorial that she was raped twice by Cosby when she was 19 years old and working with him in 35 years ago.

'The next thing I remember was coming to on his couch while being undressed,' Tarshis wrote of the first incident.

'Through the haze I thought I was being clever when I told him I had an infection and he would catch it and his wife would know he had sex with someone.

'But he just found another orifice to use. I was sickened by what was happening to me and shocked that this man I had idolized was now raping me. Of course I told no one.'  

Cosby made a rare on-stage appearance at an Erie, Pennsylvania, theater. It is unknown whether any of the allegations were addressed. 

'No, No. He don't have to rape anybody,' Williams told Fox Philly  29 in an interview on Sunday.

Williams, who was on stage with Cosby for his annual jazz festival in September, described how he met Cosby 60 years ago through his 'passion for music'.

On Sunday, Cosby's lawyer said he will not dignify 'decade-old, discredited' claims of sexual abuse with a response.

It is the first comment from the famed comedian's lawyer on an increasing uproar over allegations that he assaulted several women in the past.

John P. Schmitt said the fact that the allegations are being repeated 'does not make them true.' 

'He would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that, at age 77, he is doing his best work,' Schmitt said.

The renewed attention to a dark chapter for Cosby began last month when a comedian, Hannibal Buress, assailed him during a stand-up performance in Philadelphia, Cosby's hometown, calling him a 'rapist.' His remarks were captured on video and posted online, gaining wide exposure. 

Motivation: Williams (pictured with Cosby) believes that the alleged victims are going after the comedian's fame and fortune

Accusations: Barbara Bowman, one of Bill Cosby's alleged victims of sexual assault, poses with an image of her teenage self

It was harsh criticism of the veteran entertainer known equally for his charming standup comedy, ethnically groundbreaking 1984-92 NBC TV sitcom 'The Cosby Show' and demands for personal responsibility directed at fellow African-Americans.

Adding to the growing firestorm: One of Cosby's accusers, Barbara Bowman, leveled allegations of sexual assault against him in interviews and in an online column for the Washington Post. Bowman wrote that in 1985, she was 17 and an aspiring actress when Cosby 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times.'

Cosby, who was never criminally charged in any case, settled a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years before.

He stonewalled National Public Radio host Scott Simon during an interview aired this weekend with Cosby and his wife, Camille, about their African-American art collection. 

Cosby fell silent when asked by Simon about 'serious allegations raised about you in recent days,' which prompted the host to say, 'You're shaking your head, no. ... Do you have any response to those charges? Shaking your head, no.'
