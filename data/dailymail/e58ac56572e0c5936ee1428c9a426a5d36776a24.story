A former farm worker had to call upon his experience of lambing to deliver his baby daughter at home after frantic phone calls to a labour ward went unanswered.

Tristan Jones, 25, became a temporary midwife, and then a father to his daughter Caitlin, after helping wife Lisa, 31, through the birth.

His experience of lambing came in useful when his wife began having contractions at 3am on July 27.

Tristan Jones, 25, had to call upon his knowledge of lambing when his wife, Lisa, 31, gave birth to their daughter, Caitlin, in their living room

Mrs Jones gave birth in the living room of the couple's home in Leeds at 5.45am after struggling to contact the labour ward at the city's St James's University Hospital for almost three hours.

Mr Jones said: ‘Instinct took over to look after them. I had to keep it together and get on with it.

‘There should've been someone at least on the phone to be able to talk to us. It's just wrong.’

He added: ‘I became really involved with the lambing at a friend’s farm when I was at school and sometimes I'd be on the farm for around 12 hours a day.

‘Lambing is not that different to being a midwife as the main thing is to keep calm and be careful.

‘I had reared hundreds of lambs during my time on the farm, but it's nothing that compares to the feeling of becoming a midwife for Caitlin and Lisa.

When Mrs Jones went into labour, the couple repeatedly tried to call St James's University Hospital, in Leeds, but they claim that they did not get an answer

When they couldn't contact St James's, the couple called Leeds General Infirmary, where staff told them to wait until the contractions were five minutes apart before trying St James's again

‘My heart was racing and inside I was shaking uncontrollably. Thankfully I managed to compose myself in front of Lisa.

‘The only training I have is first aid, and I think Lisa was really proud of how I managed to deliver Caitlin safely.

‘I can't wait to be able to tell Caitlin when she grows up the story that we have and how she was born.’

When Mrs Jones went into labour she called her hospital, St James’s, but says she got no reply so called Leeds General Infirmary instead.

When the birth was imminent, they say they still couldn't get in touch with St James's so they called an ambulance. The call handler talked Mr Jones through the birth

Medical staff told her to wait at home until her contractions were five minutes apart before she called back, but when she did, she says she was told to keep trying St James's.

She kept trying St James’s every few minutes but claims that she got no answer and did not have time to drive to the hospital.

Mrs Jones said: ‘When I rang LGI, they told me to call back when my contractions reached five minutes apart, and when I did, they told me to keep trying St James's, who wouldn't pick up.

‘I felt like I had been sent round the block and felt fobbed off by both hospitals, one of which didn't answer.

Caitlin was born at 5.45am on July 27. Paramedics arrived five minutes after the birth and took the trio to St James's University Hospital

‘In hindsight, I would have called the ambulance service earlier but we were told not to bother ringing the emergency services and keep trying the labour ward at St James's.

‘When we finally arrived at St James's after the ambulance took us there, there were around six people sat behind the desks so I can't believe no-one was there to answer our call.’

Mr Jones eventually called 999 when it became apparent that the birth was imminent, and an operator talked him through the delivery.

Paramedics were on the scene about five minutes after Caitlin was born and the new family were finally taken to St James's Hospital.

A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals said: 'We are sorry Ms Jones had difficulty in contacting St James's maternity unit and can find no explanation as other calls were received'

Mother-of-three Mrs Jones, said: ‘I had no choice but to have Tristan play midwife. He's a proper hero and I couldn't have done it without him.

‘It's disgusting that they weren't around to help people and didn't pick up the phone. It made me really mad because it put my life at risk.

‘I'm lucky we had a happy ending with Caitlin. It was traumatic but we have a beautiful baby and I'd like to thank the paramedics.’

She added: ‘I just don't want it to happen to anybody else.’

Speaking of her husband’s actions, Mrs Jones said: ‘I knew Tristan had done farming before but he had no training during my pregnancy on how to deliver a baby.

‘He's my hero and I couldn't ask for a better husband. It's the ultimate thing for a husband to do to deliver his own daughter.’

The hospital says that it is happy to discuss Mrs Jones' concerns with her if she wishes. She says she just doesn't want anyone else to have the same experience

The couple, who are both full-time parents, also have another daughter Lexi, 13 months, and Mrs Jones has another child from a previous relationship.

A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals said: ‘We are sorry Ms Jones had difficulty in contacting St James's maternity unit and can find no explanation as other calls were received and logged during that period.

‘Ms Jones did contact the maternity assessment centre at the LGI on three occasions and spoke to one of the midwives who, based on the details provided, advised her accordingly.

‘Unfortunately she went on to deliver her baby very quickly following the last call. Labour can be unpredictable when a woman has had more than one child.

‘If Ms Jones would like to contact us we are happy to discuss her concerns.’
