A plastic surgery patient dubbed the 'Botox Bandit' got $6,000 worth of procedures at a San Francisco clinic before walking out without paying. 

The man, who gave his name as Paul Halford and said he was 43, was given botox, fillers and laser treatment by Dr Larry Fan at his 77 Plastic Surgery clinic.

After he finished with the treatment yesterday the man simply got up and walked out, and has not come back since to settle up. 

Police are hunting for this man, who gave his name as Paul Hanford and said he was 43, after he walked out of a San Fransisco plastic surgery clinic without paying for $6,000 of treatment

Dr Fan told NBC Bay Area that the man gave his address as 1140 Folsom Street, but that has since turned out to be an office building.

He then recalled an email a colleague had sent him in April last year warning that a 'Botox Bandit' had struck in the area. The description in the email matched his patient. 

The bizarre theft began with a consultation, during which Mr Fan met with the customer in his surgery and discussed procedures with him.

In hindsight, the surgeon says he should have known something was wrong, as the patient seemed to be acting suspiciously.

He said: 'He was a little bit secretive and a little bit private about coming into the office. He also seemed to know quite a bit about what he wanted done. Looking back there was some red flags.'

Dr Larry Fan said after the theft he remembered a colleague had sent him an email warning of a 'Botox Bandit' in the area matching the description of his patient

When it came to payment, Dr Fan said he usually asks for a credit card, but in this case the patient showed him a wadge of cash instead.

Despite his reservations Dr Fan went ahead with the three procedures which are all designed to combat the signs of ageing.

However, after the treatments were done, and with his face still puffed up and red from the surgery, the man strolled out while pretending to be talking on the phone.

Dr Fan said that he wants his story to act as a cautionary tale for other surgeons in the area.

He added: 'Hopefully this kind of thing won't happen to many people, and hopefully this particular person won't be able to continue to get away with this.'
