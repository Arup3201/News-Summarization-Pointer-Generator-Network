John Carver looks set to remain in caretaker charge of Newcastle United for their next two matches as he bids to win the head coach role - and his cause has been boosted by the return of Tim Krul.

The goalkeeper took part in a behind-closed-doors match with Celtic on Thursday having recovered from the ankle injury which has kept him sidelined since November.

And Carver, whose side travel to Chelsea on Saturday, said: ‘It’ll be huge to have him back.

‘He’s been fantastic for this football club and I know that it will give everybody a boost.

‘It will certainly give me a boost and the fans as well.

‘He is a leader and we need leaders at Chelsea.

‘He is taking part in a behind closed doors game against Celtic. We are going to give him 45 minutes and if he’s come through he will play at the weekend.’ 

Meanwhile, Carver has been told to prepare the team for the game at Chelsea and the following weekend’s visit of Southampton.

And Alan Pardew’s former assistant says he is enjoying the challenge, despite the criticism in the wake of last Saturday’s FA Cup defeat at Leicester City.

‘I am sitting here and OK, it hasn’t been a great few days, but I am enjoying it, it’s something I love and want to do,’ he said.

‘I know the pitfalls and what comes with it. The fact I put my hat in the ring some people will say I was crazy. But no, I want to do it.

‘I am really focused. I still want to do it and have the drive and enthusiasm to want to do it.’
