A two-foot high robot with flashing eyes could be the key to helping children cope with autism.

Researchers at Vanderbilt University have tested their creation, called Nao, on Aiden, a three year old diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder - and say it could help treat thousands with the condition.

The robot is able to speak, move and interact using a series on sensors - and can even tell where Aiden is looking that's to  a specially developed cap.

A team of mechanical engineers and autism experts 
at Vanderbilt University have developed the system and used it to 
demonstrate that robotic systems may be powerful tools for enhancing the
basic social learning skills of children with ASD.

Writing in the March issue of the IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems
and Rehabilitation Engineering, the researchers report that children 
with ASD paid more attention to the robot and followed its instructions 
almost as well as they did those of a human therapist in standard 
exercises used to develop joint attention skill.

'This is the first real world test of whether intelligent adaptive 
systems can make an impact on autism,' said Zachary Warren, 
who directs the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum 
Disorders (TRIAD) at Vanderbilt’s Kennedy Center.

The researchers built an 'intelligent environment' around NAO, a 
commercial humanoid robot made in France, whose control architecture was
augmented for the purpose. 

The
setup allowed the researchers to test the relative effectiveness of the
robot-based system and human therapists in joint attention training 
with a dozen 2- to 5-year-old children, six with ASD and a control group
of six typically developing children.

They alternated short human-led 
and robot-led training sessions and compared how the children performed.

The small robot stands on a table at the front of the room, and flat panel displays are attached to the side walls.

The chair where the child sits faces the front of the room and is 
high enough to put the robot at eye level.

The room is equipped with a 
number of inexpensive web cameras that are aimed at the chair.

Their purpose is to track the child’s head movements, so the system can determine where he or she is looking.

To aid in this effort, children in the study wore a baseball cap 
decorated with a strip of LED lights that allowed the computer to infer 
where they are looking.

The robot has been programmed with a 
series of verbal prompts, such as “look over here” and “let’s do some 
more,” and gestures such as looking and pointing at one of the displays,
that imitate the prompts and gestures that human therapists use in 
joint attention training.

The trials begin with a verbal prompt that asks the child to look at an image or video displayed on one of the screens.

If the child doesn’t respond, then the therapist provides increasing 
support by combining a verbal prompt with physical gestures such as 
turning her head or pointing.

When the child looks at the target then 
the therapist responds with praise, such as telling the child, 'good 
job.'

Researchers found that the children in both groups spent more time 
looking at the robot than they spent looking at the human therapist.

During the human-led sessions, the children in the control group 
spent significantly more time watching the therapist than the children 
with ASD did.

In the robot-led sessions, however, both groups spent about the same amount of time looking at the robot.

'The
children’s engagement with the robot was excellent,” said Julie Crittendon, 'and we saw

Engineer Nilanjan Sarkar began the project six years ago, when visiting his cousin in India.

Sarkar learned that his cousin’s son had been diagnosed with ASD.

'After I learned something about autism, it occurred to me that my research could be valuable for treating ASD,' he said.
