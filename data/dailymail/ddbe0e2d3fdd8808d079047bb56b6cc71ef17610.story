A Walmart in Canton, Ohio, has set up a canned food drive so that its own employees can afford to pay for Thanksgiving dinner.

The fundraiser was revealed earlier this month when an employee snapped a picture of two plastic bins managers had set up in a break room at the store with a sign that reads, 'Please donate food items here so Associates in Need and enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner.'

The image has become a lightning rod for criticism for the retail giant. Labor activists say it's proof that Walmart doesn't pay its employees nearly enough and that wages are so small that many can't even afford the holiday meals that they work to sell.

Walmart has fired back, saying that the food drive at the Canton Walmart is proof that its employees stick together and support each other when they fall on hard times.

At least one employee said she is grateful for the program, which helped her put Thanksgiving dinner on the table when her child support payments dried up

'It is for associates who have had some hardships come up. Maybe their spouse lost a job,' Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg told the Cleveland Plain Dealer.Â 

'This is part of the company's culture to rally around associates and take care of them when they face extreme hardships.'

But, the picture has become a rallying cry for labor groups, including Organization United for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart) - which says it is planning protests and employee walk-outs for Black Friday at stores in Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio.

'Why would a company do that?' Vanessa Ferreira, a labor organizer and former Walmart employee, told the Plain Dealer.

'The company needs to stand up and give them their 40 hours and a living wage, so they don't have to worry about whether they can afford Thanksgiving.'

The sign was posted at the Walmart in Canton, Ohio - but it has energized labor leaders across the country

The company says it pays an average hourly wage of $12.87 and hour and full-time employees usually earn about $25,000 a year.

However, labor activists say independent surveys of employees show the average wage is between $8 and $10 an hour - which works out to $15,000 to $20,000 a year, a figure that is below the federal poverty line for a family of four.

The employee who took the photo of the food drive in the Canton Walmart told the Plain Dealer she makes almost $12 an hour, but earned only $17,000 last year because she frequently see her hours cut.

Walmart says it has programs to help needy employees who find themselves in financial emergencies.

It also says it is promoting 35,000 employees from part time to full time in the last quarter of 2013 alone - as part of its commitment to hiring full time employees.

Erica Reed, who works at the Canton store doing the food drive, says she has benefited from the effort in previous years when she lost her child support payments when her children's father was sent to jail.

'It took a burden off me. I didn't have to worry about how I was getting my turkey to feed them Thanksgiving dinner,' she told the newspaper.
