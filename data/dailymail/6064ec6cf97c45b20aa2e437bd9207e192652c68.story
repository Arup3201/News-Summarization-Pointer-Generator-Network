Manchester United earned a hard-fought point at the Britannia Stadium after coming from behind to draw 1-1 against Stoke City.

Ryan Shawcross put the home side ahead before Radamel Falcao showed his poacher's instinct to level the score.

Here, Sportsmail runs through how the players performed.

STOKE CITY (4-2-3-1)

ASMIR BEGOVIC - 6

Bred confidence with his handling at set pieces but angered Robin van Persie by claiming a Wayne Rooney through ball with his studs raised dangerously. RVP had a right to be annoyed.

GEOFF CAMERON - 5.5

Needed the help of Jonathan Walters to stop the persistent United raids down their left-hand side. Stuck to the task though. 

RYAN SHAWCROSS - 7

Former Manchester United trainee reacted like a instinctive striker to volley in Peter Crouch's header inside two minutes but was later taken in by Michael Carrick's flick-on for the equaliser.

MARC MUNIESA - 6

Used all the experience gained in the Spanish game by breaking up play with 'professional' fouls when the occasion dictated it. Nowhere near Radamel Falcao for the equaliser and nearly gifted Van Persie an injury-time winner but recovered to stop the ball reaching him.

ERIK PIETERS - 6

Excellent delivery when he got forward but defensively was pulled around too much by United's quicksilver forwards.

STEVEN NZONZI - 6

Overshadowed for once by Glenn Whelan in the central midfield area. Found Rooney's clever movement a problem and gave away free-kicks.

GLENN WHELAN - 6.5

Did the ugly defensive work in midfield with real aplomb, always prepared to put his foot in to get a tackle on the likes of Rooney.

MARKO ARNAUTOVIC - 7

Erratic and unpredictable but pure quality at other times. His range of passing meant the injured Bojan Krkic wasn't missed as much as feared. Fantastic free-kick led to Crouch hitting the post and his set pieces were always a threat.

JONATHAN WALTERS - 6 

Work-rate never in doubt but lucky not to gift United a penalty when he blocked Luke Shaw's cross with his hand. His battle with Shaw was one of the game's highlights.

MAME BIRAM DIOUF - 6.5

No wonder Mark Hughes says he will miss the forward when he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations this month with Senegal. Harried the United defence and dispossessed Jonny Evans before shooting wide. Had a cracking shot deflected wide by Chris Smalling. 

PETER CROUCH - 8

A real handful who gave United's defence problems throughout. Showed why Stoke won't want to lose him in January by cleverly peeling away to the edge of the box to set up the early goal for Shawcross with a great header. Appealed strongly for a penalty when another header hit Smalling on the arm and also hit the post.

MANAGER: MARK HUGHES - 7

The Stoke boss felt there was a weakness in United's defence and tried to exploit it with the size of Crouch and pace of Diouf. Stoke's set-piece delivery was excellent.

DAVID DE GEA - 6

Doesn't relish coming to the Potteries and though he wasn't overworked he allowed Shawcross to score inside the six yard box and was helpless when Crouch beat Smalling in the air and headed against the upright. 

PHIL JONES - 6

Needed all his physical attributes in a heavyweight battle with Crouch and gave as good as he got after a disastrous start when he let the 6ft 7in centre forward set up the first goal.

CHRIS SMALLING - 6.5

As the main central defender, it wasn't great that Crouch and then Shawcross had time in the box when Stoke scored from their early corner. Improved as the match wore on and got a vital block to deflect Diouf's goalbound shot wide. Stoke felt they should have had a penalty though when Crouch's header hit him on the arm.

JONNY EVANS - 5

One player who just hasn't looked comfortable for some reason with Louis van Gaal's three at the back. Hesitated when put under pressure by Diouf and fortunate the Stoke forward missed and nervy throughout.

ASHLEY YOUNG - 6

Has been the most improved United player under Van Gaal. Having played on the left in recent weeks, he switched to the right to accommodate Shaw and mucked in for his team, even winning defensive headers.

LUKE SHAW - 7.5

Impressive energy given that it was the youngster's first start for six weeks after injury. Got forward from wingback and could have won a penalty when Walters handled his cross.

MICHAEL CARRICK - 7

Showed there is more to his game than clever passing when he got in ahead of team-mate Jones to expertly flick on Rooney's corner for Falcao to score. A Rolls Royce in midfield. 

JUAN MATA - 5.5

One of those afternoons. A windy, cloudy wet day in Stoke when the Spaniard couldn't get on the ball consistently to influence things. His recent form has been good but his place remains vulnerable once Daley Blind is fit again allowing Rooney to push further up.

WAYNE ROONEY - 6.5

His early frustrations included a slip and vainly appealing for a penalty but those were eradicated when his excellent right-foot corner led to a United equaliser. He is becoming a genuine leader in the team.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE - 5.5

Largely anonymous in the first half but became embroiled in some handbags with Begovic after the keeper aimed his studs at him as he collected an attempted Rooney through-ball. Had one sight of goal late on and his volley was just wide.

RADAMEL FALCAO - 6.5

Has to be right up there among the Premier League's best penalty-area finishers. Reacted quicker than anyone else to convert Carrick's flick and make it 1-1. Can't be left alone for a moment.

Subs not used: Lindegaard, Blackett, Fletcher, Wilson

MANAGER: LOUIS VAN GAAL - 6.5 

Credit for picking such an attacking line-up at Stoke with Falcao, Van Persie, Rooney and Mata all starting. They did create chances but were left vulnerable at the back.

REFEREE

MICHAEL OLIVER - 6.5

Stoke will feel he should have awarded them a penalty at 1-1 when the ball hit Smalling on the arm after an effort from Crouch, but Oliver will feel the United defender was so close he wouldn't have been able to get out the way. United arguably had an even better case after Walters blocked Shaw's cross with his hand. Kept the game flowing though and didn't have to book anyone in a rumbustious contest.
