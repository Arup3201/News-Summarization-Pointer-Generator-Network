Less than two weeks after being stabbed 19-times by two so-called friends and left for dead in the wild woods of Wisconsin, the 12-year-old 'Slender Man' attack victim is back home.

Released from hospital on Friday, the young girl who is not being identified because of her age has been recuperating in her bedroom watching episodes of Full House.

Stabbed on May 31, the girl is trying to understand her betrayal and brutal attempted murder by Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, who planned to kill her as an offering to the mythical figure of Slender Man.

'She’s a very big cat lover,' said family friend Dana Hoffman to ABC News.

'She’s got two cats at home, and you know, it’s just trying to re-establish what that new normal looks like and surround her with things that are familiar.'

The young girl was discovered by a passing cyclist after managing to crawl to a road after being stabbed so badly by Weier and Geyser that they thought she would die in the pool of blood they left her in.

Another family friend, Krista Natarelli, said the girl's resilience is inspiring.

'She knew that she wanted to live and she was going to do everything she could to make that happen,' Natarelli said to ABC News.

'She is going to survive this,' she said. 'People can overcome horrible things. She is a beacon of life for all of us.'

On Wednesday, her condition improved from 'critical but stable' to 'fair', a spokesman at Waukesha Memorial Hospital confirmed.

Her parents updated friends, families and supporters on a fundraising page set up to help cover their medical bills.

In the message, they wrote that their daughter has been walking around the hospital with the help of her father and resting by watching TV in a wheelchair.

They say they've been 'overwhelmed with the amount of love and support' they've received, but ask everyone to respect their daughter's privacy by not naming her in social media posts or to the press.

'Our little girl is a fighter and is making strides of improvement each and every day. We appreciate your patience, love and support as we too are stunned and saddened by this tragedy,' they wrote.

As of Thursday afternoon, the fund had raised more than $40,000 of its $250,000 goal.

Geyser and Weier have since been charged as adults on counts of first-degree intentional homicide, and police say they had been plotting the crime for month.

Both suspects told police they tried to kill their friend because of their obsession with Slender Man, a character they discovered on a website called Creepypasta Wiki, which is devoted to horror stories.

In an official police report Weier said Slender Man is the ‘leader’ of Creepypasta, and she needed to kill to show their loyalty.

The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth 
that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009.

She explained Geyser told her they needed slaughter their friend in order to become ‘proxies’ of Slender Man and gain access to his mansion, which they believed was located inside northern Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest.

They planned to kill the victim and then walk to the mansion.

Weier said the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

But the fighter pushed on, and crawled out of the woods to safety where she waved down passing bicyclist Greg Steinberg.

On Wednesday, audio of Steinberg's 911 call was released, in which he can be heard comforting the 12-year-old victim while paramedics rushed to the scene.

Steinberg told the dispatcher that the girl had been stabbed, but was conscious.

'Yes, she's breathing,' he told the operator. 'She says she can take shallow breaths. She's alert.'

Suspects Geyser and Weier were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack.

If convicted as adults, the girls face up to 65 years in prison.
