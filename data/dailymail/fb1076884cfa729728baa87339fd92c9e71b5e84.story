It may only be October, but we can think of one very good reason to get hold of your 2013 calender right now.

Actually, we can think of 11 very good reasons.

Eleven Lincolnshire firemen have peeled off their suspenders, slipped out of their T-shirts and stripped down to their flame-retardant trousers to be photographed for a steamy topless calendar, through which they hope to raise money for a motor neurone disease charity.

Firefighter Sam Brader, 36, of Brigg, said: 'We originally did a photograph as a bit of a laugh for watch manager John Lowden's wife, but it turned out to be really fun. The shoot itself was great fun and everyone had a really good time, it was very relaxed as you can tell from the pictures.'

Lisa Blow, chair of the Motor Neurone Disease Association's Grimsby and Cleethorpes branch, had the idea of producing the calendar.

Ms Blow, whose mother has the disease, said: 'The idea was well-received, and with willing participants we have been able to put together a fantastic calendar.

'We have had some great support from companies that have sponsored the calendar to help with production costs. Considering that no-one has any experience in front of the camera the firefighters look really relaxed, and they were all thrilled with the finished photos.'

St Andrews Hospice in Grimsby - which gives the MND branch and their patients a huge amount of care and support - will also receive 25 per cent of profits from sales of the Â£8 calendar.

Nick Tharratt, Humberside Fire And Rescue Service Group Manager, said: 'Our staff were happy to volunteer and assist one of our colleagues with such a worthy cause that can make such a difference to those individuals and families affected by such a debilitating disease, and we wish Lisa and the charity well in the sale of the calendar.'

Motor neurone disease is a 
progressive disease that attacks the motor neurones, or nerves, in the 
brain and spinal cord. This means messages gradually stop reaching 
muscles, which leads to weakness and wasting.

It can affect how you walk, talk, 
eat, drink and breathe, and although there is currently no cure, 
symptoms can be managed to help you achieve the best possible quality of
life.

The calendar is being sold in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, and on eBay. To obtain a copy, email 
Lisa Blow at lisablow@btinternet.com

Charity effort: Proceeds from sales of the calendar will go towards the Motor Neurone Disease Association.
