Liverpool:

Olympiacos:

Raheem Sterling scored the only goal of the game early on as Liverpool beat Olympiacos 1-0 in Chicago in their first group game of the International Champions Cup.

Sterling turned home Daniel Sturridge's mishit in the fifth minute, as Liverpool failed to build on a quick start against the Greek champions.

An opportunity for both sides in the final moments as Brad Jones makes a good save for Liverpool, before Ibe breaks and nearly finds Joe Allen with a reverse pass.

So, Liverpool open up their International Champions Cup campaign with a win... but we probably expected more goals after Sterling put the Reds ahead after 5 minutes.

Some rustiness from Liverpool, and they face Manchester City on Wednesday night

Not sure what to make of this performance from a Liverpool perspective. Solid in some areas, unconvincing in others. Olympiacos have had more than enough opportunities to score, while Liverpool have only had one clear-cut opportunity from which they scored.

The performance of Lazar Markovic, though, will be encouraging to all Reds fans. The Serbian was perhaps Liverpool's best player. 

What an opportunity for Bouchalakis as Joe Allen gives away possession in the worst possible area - central, with no cover and 40 yards from goal.

Bouchalakis speeds through, skipping through Kelly but he can't reach the ball after going round Brad Jones. He didn't go down after the challenge from the goalkeeper, but perhaps he should have.

'More changes and now Raheem Sterling’s afternoon is over. He spoke impressively on Friday about how he will deal with the expectation and pressure that is going to be on him next season but he has the tools to deal with that; this was an exciting cameo from the 19-year-old, one that augurs well for him developing again when it really matters.'

Coutinho, who has looked very bright since coming on, unleashes a piling effort from 25 yards, which fizzes just wide of the Olympiacos goal.

Daniel Sturridge comes off for Lambert, as Sterling makes way for Jordan Ibe.

Olympiacos still pressing forward in search of an equaliser, and Bouchalakis, who scored a superb goal against AC Milan on Thursday, hits one high and wide over Jones' goal.

Coutinho does brilliantly well to give the ball to Robinson but his cross evades everyone, and then at the other end Martin Skrtel makes another superb interception from Kasami's through ball. 

More changes on their way for Liverpool on the hour mark, with Lucas, Coates and Kelly coming on for Johnson, Toure and Gerrard

Papadopolous has a shot from range, and Jones had to show some interest in it as it nearly creeps in the Liverpool goal.

It's been a bit flat here from Liverpool, as it was in Boston last week. Rodgers will want the intensity to increase soon, especially given Manchester City's ruthless 5-1 win over AC Milan earlier tonight.

'The substitutions have started and Liverpool have replaced the lively Lazar Markovic and Emre Can, as well as left-back Jose Enrique, with Philippe Coutinho, Joe Allen and Jack Robinson. Coutinho is a player whose progress needs charting this summer.

'Rodgers has described him as “the brain” of Liverpool’s team but for all his talent, there is no guarantee yet that he is going to be a starter from the word go. Should he play as he did against Roma on Wednesday, however, Coutinho might make Rodgers’ decision easy.

'He looked like a high-class performer in Boston and maybe this challenge will inspire him further.'

So unlucky for Gevorg Ghazaryan, who gets into the penalty area on the break and strikes the woodwork from 15 yards. Jones was rooted to the spot.

Dossevi then gets a few yards of space in a similar area, but his shot dragged just wide to the left of Jones' goal.

Coutinho, Allen and Robinson come on for Enrique, Emre Can and Lazar Markovic.

Skrtel gets a vital touch on the ball after a dangerous ball into the box nearly found Dossevi. Olympiacos have been competitive so far, and have worried Liverpool throughout.

Olympiacos are keeping the ball beautifully around Liverpool's penalty area, with Saviola dropping deep to get involved.

The ball drops to the Argentine Saviola, with just Jones to beat, but Enrique recovers well to put the ball out for a corner. The corner goes short and finds Diamantakos, but his effort drags wide.

Markovic slips through two tackles on the left corner of the penalty area, and his curling effort has too much on it as it goes two yards high and wide. 

Great play from the 20-year-old Serbian, who has looked exciting so far.

Glen Johnson calmly clears the ball under pressure, but it's Olympiacos with the ball so far... until Liverpool break through Markovic and Sterling... but the latter's ball can't find Jordan Henderson, who would have had a one-on-one on the left.

Gerrard's corner is punched clear by Megyeri in the Olympiacos goal.

'Interesting to watch Steven Gerrard operating here. When Liverpool played Olympiakos in the Champions League 10 years ago, Gerrard was a marauding midfielder, who operated high and dynamically around the opposition area.

'Now, in this new role, Gerrard sits deep and performs like a quarter-back, dropping deep, splitting his central defenders and launching attacks. His influence on this team going forward should not be understated.

'As for the atmosphere here, it is lively without being anything you would associate with the Premier League. Suggestions that Soldier Field would be full to its 61,000 capacity have proven a little over optimistic.'

Aha, there's a glimpse of Lazar Markovic in full flow. The new signing paces through the Olympiacos midfield before being brought down on the edge of the area cynically.

He limps off but should be okay... as Sturridge's free-kick hits the wall before Gerrard's follow up goes well wide.

Saviola brings a great blocked save out of Jones, but he is called offside after a quickly-taken free-kick on the left.

It nearly, very nearly, caught out the Liverpool defence, who are living dangerously at the moment. 

Olympiacos attack again, and Dossevi has a chance to blast the ball on the volley, but it's blocked well by Skrtel.

Liverpool haven't got into too much of a rhythm since scoring, as Jose Enrique cleans up with Saviola looking dangerous for the Greek side.

'So here we are in Soldier Field and there is a good chance this Liverpool side will be close to how Brendan Rodgers lines up on the first day of the campaign against Southampton.

'Steven Gerrard is lying deep with Emre Can and Jordan Henderson alongside, while Raheem Sterling – scorer of Liverpool’s first goal here – Lazar Markovic and Daniel Sturridge are providing the threat.

'The defence will be reshaped, especially as Dejan Lovren has just signed, but this is the base Rodgers will work off.'

Johnson loses the ball Ghazaryan, who piles into the box, but his curling effort doesn't trouble Brad Jones, going wide of the goal.

That was poor from Johnson, who predictably turned inside towards Jones, and wasn't fouled by the Olympiacos man.

Raheem Sterling!

It was a tad fortunate, but Liverpool won't care about that. They lead after five minutes at Soldier Field.

Sturridge wound up a long shot from outside the area, but he missed his kick. Luckily, the ball fell nicely into the path of Raheem Sterling to tuck away from six yards.

1-0 to Liverpool.

Liverpool, wearing their 'Dennis the Menace' style third kit, get us underway at Soldier Field, home to the Chicago Bears NFL team.

Steven Gerrard is leading his team-mates out of the tunnel and onto the pitch Solider Field in Chicago.

Game looks set to kick-off about 10 minutes late as it stands, but stay with us for all the action as it happens.

Manchester City are currently dishing out a severe beating to AC Milan.

Manuel Pellegrini's men are 5-1 up courtesy of two goals from Stevan Jovetic and strikes from Scott Sinclair, Jesus Navas and Kelechi Iheanacho.

Starting XI: Megyeri, Abidal, Papadopolous, Siovas, Do Carmo, Ghazaryan, Maniatis, N'Dinga, Diamantakos, Dossevi, Saviola

Loic Remy's move to Merseyside is OFF after the QPR striker failed his medical.

The Frenchman had been expected to join up with Rodgers' squad in America after the two clubs agreed an £8.5million fee, but he didn't pass the club's medical tests in Boston earlier this week.

And welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of Liverpool vs Olympiacos in the International Champions Cup group stage in Chicago.

Over in Pittsburgh in Group B there is a storm brewing on and off the pitch, with Manchester City 4-1 up at half-time against AC Milan.

However, the second-half has been delayed with heavy rain and extreme weather on its way... we'll have to see if that one gets underway again.

For now, Brendan Rodgers names a strong XI with new signings Emre Can and Lazar Markovic starting.

Liverpool: Jones, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Enrique, Gerrard, Henderson, Can, Sterling, Markovic, Sturridge
