A Stradivarius violin and one of Monet's waterlily paintings, which once belonged to the reclusive New York heiress Huguette Clark, are due to be sold at auction.

Starting on May 6, Christie's will host a series of sales as the estate of the mysterious millionaire, who died in 2011 aged 104, is divided up.

Among the 400 items of fine art, rare manuscripts and collection of beautiful musical instruments, are lots expected to reach several million dollars.

Rare: This painting by French impressionist Claude Monet has not been seen in public since 1926

One of the most prized pieces, which is due to be sold on June 18, is the Stradivarius violin that Miss Clark's copper baron father bought for her to play when she was a teenager.

The instrument, crafted by the master violin maker in 1731, is known as the Kreutzer after the famed French musician who Beethoven composed Violin Sonata No 9 for, and who used to own it.

The violin, found in a cupboard at one of Miss Clark's luxury vacant homes, is expected to sell for $7.5 million.

Its sound was described to Today by grammy winner Joshua Bell as having a 'rich warm quality'.

Miss Clark collected several Stradivarius violins in her lifetime. Of the 650 still in existence today, nine can be traced to her family including four known as the Paganini quartet, which she collected and donated to Corcoran Gallery of Art.

'She lived a wonderfully cultured life. She was the heiress to a 
tremendous fortune, and certainly surrounded herself with many of the 
trappings that one would expect,' Andrew McVinish, of Christie’s New York, told CBS.

Valuable: Miss Clark paid $125,000 for this Renoir, which is expected to sell for more than $10 million

Some of the items included in the collection, which was started by Miss Clark's father, are so rare that Christie's has exhibited them at its auction houses in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and London, as well as in New York.

Prized: The Stradivarius is one of several the Clark family have owned

Miss Clark was the last surviving child of Senator. William A. Clark, who was born in a log cabin and became one of the wealthiest men of his day.

He is the namesake of Nevada's Clark County and established its county seat, Las Vegas.

A
 onetime socialite who became a social shadow, Miss Clark died at 
104 in 2011. She had a penthouse and two other apartments on Manhattan's
 Fifth Avenue and exquisite homes in Santa Barbara, California, and New 
Canaan, Connecticut, but she chose to spend her last 20 years in a 
hospital.

The art collector also loved music, and several of her instruments are included in the auction, including 6ft tall Louis XV-style concert harp, which is expected to go for $3,000 to $5,000.

A collection of rare and valuable paintings collected by the art lover are also being offered at auction.

They
 include three Renoirs, including one Miss Clark bought for $125,000 
which is expected to sell for $10 million, and a waterlily painting by 
Monet, which has not been publicly exhibited since 1926.

Miss
 Clark bought the 1905 painting, Nymphéas, in 1930 and it spent the next
 80 years hanging in the dining room of her sumptuous Fifth Avenue 
apartment. It is expected to attract up to $35 million when it is sold 
on May 6, along with the Renoirs.

A William Merritt Chase painting, A 
Water Fountain in Prospect Park, expected to fetch $1 million, and John 
Singer Sargent’s Girl Fishing at San Vigilio, which is estimated to make
 more than $3 million, will be auctioned in a later sale on June 18.

Miss
 Clark didn't just admire art, she painted herself. A self-portrait and 
her palette will be included in the sale of the family collection.

Eye for art: Renoir's Chrysanthèmes will be displayed in Tokyo, London, Hong Kong and New York before being auctioned

American great: Girl Fishing at San Vigilio by John Singer Sargent from the Clark collection, is to be sold in June

Collection: This 1875 Renoir is expected to sell for up to $5 million

Decorative arts: This George I walnut and beech armchair from 1725 is estimated to sell for $60,000 to $90,000

The June auction, An American Dynasty: The Clark Family Treasures, combines the bulk of the heiress's extensive collection of books, instruments and paintings.

A 16th Century, beautifully illustrated copy of Book of Hours, and a first edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, printed in Brooklyn in 1855, are among the highlights of the book sale.

The Book of Hours is expected to sell for at least $40,000 and the Whitman is anticipated to go for $100,000 to $150,000.

The entire sale is expected to make about $70 million, and some of the proceeds will go towards a settlement from the disputed will between Miss Clark's nurse and her distant relatives.

With no close relatives, Miss Clark left a 
roughly $300 million estate and a swirl of questions about the input 
she had received from a close circle of caregivers and advisers, and about 
the extensive gifts and bequests she had given them in return.

She
 signed two wills within six weeks at age 98, the first bequeathing her 
riches mostly to about 20 distant relatives and the second cutting them 
out.

The September settlement mainly benefited arts institutions and the distant relations.

Some
 of Miss Clark's real estate and possessions have already been sold. A 2012 
Christie's auction of 17 pieces of her jewelry, including a pink nine-carat diamond ring, brought in about $21 million.
