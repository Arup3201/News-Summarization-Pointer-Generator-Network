From outside the changing room, it must have sounded as though I was in labour. And as I huffed and puffed, I was certainly in agony.

The green jeans I’d spotted from M&S’s Limited Edition range in my size, a 14, wouldn’t go past my knees. Exasperated, I headed out for a 16 — only to find that they wouldn’t go past my thighs either. So I braved the rails again for a size 18. This time they fitted. Just.

What was going on? In previous weeks, I’d bought a pair of size 14 trousers and a top from the same shop — and they’d all fitted.

While we all know that one make’s size ten is another’s 14, surely in the same shop, you should know what you’re in for size-wise.

Not in my local M&S, which has nine ranges under one roof — and each one seems to have different sizing. To find out which one fitted me best, I decided to try on a selection of items — and one size most definitely did not fit all . . . 

M&S SKIRT

SIZE 18: There’s more chance of The X Factor’s Cheryl singing live than me fitting into my usual size 14 on my bottom half in M&S’s Limited Edition. Two sizes up, this print skirt (£35) slipped on fine.

SIZE 14: (left) Perhaps because this burgundy pencil skirt (£29.50) from M&S’s standard Collection is stretchy it fitted better.The size 16 was baggy. SIZE 16: (right) A rather dull work skirt(£22.50) from M&S Collection’s Tailored range.I tried the 14,but stretched across my thighs it was wrinklier than Keith Richards

M&S JEANS 

SIZE 18: These are the fateful Limited Edition jeans (£29.50) that upset me in the first place. I even thought about trying a 20, but I just got away with an 18 . . . as long as I didn’t sit down.

SIZE 14: (left) Usually I wouldn’t venture near the Classics Collection, which is aimed at the older lady. But the stretchy cord material on these trousers (£18) as well as an elasticated waist meant I easily fit a size 14. SIZE 16: (right) The most comfy and flattering, these dark blue jeans from Per Una (£39.50) felt so good that I’m going to buy them, even though the label said they are a size bigger than I normally wear.

 M&S DRESS

SIZE 18: I loved the bottle-green colour of this Per Una dress (£79) but when I tried on the size 14, I looked like a lumpy courgette. The 16 doesn’t fare much better but the 18 fitted like a glove

SIZE 16: (left) I tried the size 14 of this lace russet dress(£59) from the Autograph collection first. While I could just fit into it, there was only one canape’s worth of room before it burst. The size 16 was perfect SIZE 12: This black and navy striped dress with zip detail (£45) from M&S Collection is admittedly a little snug in a size 12, but the size 14 was too big and baggy at the waist.

M&S CASUAL TOP 

SIZE 16: Thanks to its stretchy material, this striped top (£9.50), again from Limited Edition, is another I will be buying. Even if it was a size 16

SIZE 12: (left) My top half has always been smaller than my bottom half, but I was surprised to fit easily into this size 12 top (£25) from M&S Collection. SIZE 14: (right) At last, a Limited Edition piece that fitted in my usual size. I loved the collar on this top (£35), but it could do with being a little longer in the body

Jill Foster is usually a size 14 and yet she struggles to find clothes to fit in Marks & Spencer

She tries on various items from several different ranges and found she went from a size 12 to a size 18

Despite this Jill claims she will be buying some of the clothes she tried on even if they weren't her regular size
