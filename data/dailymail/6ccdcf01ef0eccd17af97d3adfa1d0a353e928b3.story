A dictionary has revealed how 13th century nicknames denoting a person's job, appearance or religion have become the family names many people use today.

The use of surnames was largely unheard of in Europe prior to the 11th century, but as people began to need to be identified for reasons such as paying taxes they became increasingly prevalent.

Lexicographers Patrick Hanks and Flavia Hodges have revealed where many European family names originated from in their book A Dictionary Of Surnames.

What's in a name: Taylor Swift's surname may have come from one of her ancestors being a fast runner, while actress Emily Blunt's surname traditionally denoted someone with fair hair

According to the book's authors, names relating to a person's job, where they lived or even what they looked like, became increasingly during the Middle Ages as societies became more bureaucratic.

For example, in a town or village where many people shared the same first name, individuals might have started to be known by another characteristic.

According to the book, which examines more than 100,000 last names, the name Bass related to a short man, Read - a person with red hair, or a ruddy complexion, Swift - a fast person, and Vaisey someone with a cheerful disposition.

Twigg - A thin person

Vaisey - A cheerful person (from enveisie, meaning playful, merry)

Wight - Strong-willed or brave

The surname Cruise, as used by actor Tom - who has dropped part of his surname Cruise Mapother - referred to a person who was bold or fierce, while actress Emily Blunt may be descended from someone known for his blond hair.

Someone who stayed at home might be known by the house where he lived, while someone who travelled from another town or country could be referred to denoting the place where they had come from.

They may even simply have been referred to as New, Newman or Newcombe.

Others took on their trades as last names, such as Smith, Wright, and Chandler, or their work as a servant to someone of a higher status, such as Prior, Monk, King, and Earl.

In the early Middle Ages a son may have been known by a different name to his father, if he performed a different role, or exhibited another characteristic.

However, as families became increasingly stable, names started to be handed down through generations, with wives adopting her husband's family name, and children taking theirs from their fathers.

'The phenomenon of the modern family name is, broadly, of medieval European origin and is associated with the rise of bureaucracies,' said Mr Hanks.

'Tax collectors, beadles and bailiffs, sheriffs and reeves (officers of law enforcement and the courts) had, like their modern counterparts, a particular need for the precise identification of individuals.

'In a period when the eldest son inherited property and titles, it became normal to inherit the father's surname along with other property.'

Even in cases where surnames had been based on a negative nickname, once the monikers were put on record they were very rarely changed.
