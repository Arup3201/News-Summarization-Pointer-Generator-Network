This year has been testing for John Bercow.

Alongside a taxing day-job as Speaker of the House, the 51-year-old has been faced with the scandal of his wife kissing another man in public and her gallivanting around London hot-spots.

But the politician was afforded one treat to see out the year - an interview with his 'hero', tennis champion Roger Federer.  

Taking a spot as a guest-editor of BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, Mr Bercow was given a whole five minutes to pick the athlete's brain during its Boxing Day broadcast. 

Between serious questions about the tennis player's sporting success, the Speaker slipped in the fact that he had watched him 65 times this year, more than Federer's own mother, as pointed out by a BBC presenter.

Referring to Federer's comment that travelling the world is 'a lot of fun', Mr Bercow gushed: 'Maybe that concept demonstrates one of the differences between you and other great players, you don't see it as a burden to be borne. 

'I've watched 65 of your matches this year and I always have the impression that you absolutely love it.'   

Later in the interview he casually rolls off the champion's achievements, ('302 weeks as number one,  25 grand slams singles, 36, semi finals and and 43 quarter finals), before pleading: 'What explains that consistency of performance?' 

Modestly, Federer says his achievements were inspired by the greats before him, namely Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods.

Later, when asked by BBC presenter Mishal Husain when he believes his sporting idol will hang up his racquet, he protests: 'I don't see him declining.' 

Sporting a Roger Federer hat, Mr Bercow, a former child tennis star himself, continues: 'I think the magnificent movement, the extraordinary stroicism and calm under pressure are something special and I think that for as long as Roger wants to play, lets's enjoy him.

'He's the greatest tennis player I've ever seen in my life.' 

Despite his elation, listeners were quick to question how the politician had time throughout the year to attend 65 matches, missing only 20 played by the star this year.

'If John Bercow had time on his hands to attend 65 Federer matches in 2014 why do we need a commons speaker?' asked one Twitter user, while another observed: 'Busy speaker!'.
