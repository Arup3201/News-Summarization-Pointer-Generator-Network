Sebastian Giovinco has hinted that he may be forced to leave Serie A champions Juventus in January if he continues to struggle for a regular game.

The Italy international, who has spent previous seasons on loan with Empoli and Parma, has been linked with several English clubs, including Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool and Chelsea, in the past.

The diminutive 27-year-old has struggled for a starting spot this season and, although he would like to stay in Turin, he concedes that the situation needs to change.

He told Rai Sport: 'I'm not resigned (to being a substitute), it's not in my character.

'I have to evaluate many things but I'm not thinking about it now.

'I'll try to give my best, then we'll see later this year if I will continue at Juventus. I hope so.

'The season has only just begun. I hope to be able to add my contribution.'

Giovinco's contract expires at the end of the season and the Italians are yet to open discussions over an extension.

His agent, Andrea D'Amico, added: 'I do not understand how  Juventus could decide to lose a fantastic player like Giovinco for free.'
