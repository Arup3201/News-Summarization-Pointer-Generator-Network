Labour will pledge to cap the amount of sugar in breakfast cereals in a bid to tackle Britain’s epidemic of childhood obesity.

Andy Burnham, the party’s health spokesman, said it was wrong that youngsters were starting their day with a bowl of Kellogg’s Frosties – a cereal he said contained 38 per cent sugar.

He told House magazine that he had been prompted to act after his wife alerted him to the damaging effects of excess sugar on the nation’s health.

Labour's shadow health secretary said children should not be eating bowls of cereal that were 38 per cent sugar

The announcement comes a week before the Department of Health publishes new research on the health effects of sugar and the options ministers are considering to deal with it.

Some campaigners are calling for a sugar tax to reduce consumption, but the government is sceptical about the idea.

Almost a third of two-to-15-year-olds are overweight, and over the past three years, at least 932 children under the age of 15 have needed urgent medical attention as a consequence of their obesity.

Mr Burnham will unveil Labour’s full plans for a cap in two weeks’ time as part of a public health ‘white paper’. The shadow health secretary told the magazine that Frosties would still exist after his cap is introduced.

‘I’m not comfortable with the idea that any child in my constituency sits down at breakfast time to a bowl of food that is 38 per cent sugar,’ he said. ‘And if people are comfortable with that, well I’m going to disagree with them.

‘I don’t think any child should be regularly taking in sugar of that level.’

It is understand the policy would affect a range of brands, including Tesco Choco Snaps which have 36.1g of sugar per 100g according to Which? research.

Mr Burnham said he would consult on the level of the cap, and denied the policy was ‘anti-business’.

He also appeared to rule out a sugar tax, saying: ‘It’s just not something that would fit well with any Labour person – taxing food. So I’ve always been pretty clear that that isn’t the answer.

‘But there is a problem with rising levels of sugar in people’s diets. Sugar particularly, but also fat and salt.’

The former Health Secretary said it was his wife, Marie-France van Heel, who had got him on to the issue of sugar.

He said that when he goes round Asda on a Sunday afternoon, his wife often picks things he has put in the trolley and says ‘look at this’.

‘She’s the one who got me on to it. She’s always been very big on it. You buy some of the products that look as though they’re slightly healthier, they’ve got grain in or whatever, they don’t have “sugar” in their name on the box. But you look at them and go “oh my god it’s loaded!”.

‘In the old days we had it from the bowl on the table, on your Weetabix. It’s built in now isn’t it? So I just don’t think people are able to monitor and control the amount of sugar that they’re taking.’

Mr Burnham said a Labour government would act ‘unapologetically, firmly and decisively’ on children’s diet, smoking and access to cheap alcohol.

But for adults, he said the ‘finger-wagging nanny state message does turn people off’. ‘You know “don’t do this, don’t do that”. That’s run its course,’ he said.

‘We’re saying, where is it right for the government to act and where is it right to let people make their own choices? We’re saying it’s absolutely right for the state to intervene, and probably do so even more decisively than we did when we were in government, to protect children.

‘Because children don’t control the situations they’re exposed to, the environment they’re exposed to or the food that’s put down to them. Therefore I do think the state has an absolutely clear moral and intellectual basis for saying “we will act to protect all children”.

‘It’s trying to deal with the nanny state charge that gets thrown all the time whenever you try to do something on health.’

Mr Burnham said he was not consulted about Mr Miliband’s decision to pose for a photo holding the Sun newspaper, and that he ‘was right to apologise’.

He also revealed he was ‘looking at’ curbs on e-cigarette advertising, and called for a new national campaign to get 50 per cent of the population doing some physical activity by 2025 – up from 25 per cent at present.

And he said the decisions to award the World Cup to both Qatar and Russia were ‘flawed’.
