It was a day to celebrate families but one little boy took it a bit further and managed to steal the show when he got on stage with the Pope.

The Pontiff was addressing a crowd of families at the Vatican when the youngster wandered on stage.

Identified only as the 'boy in yellow' the lad stared at Pope Francis as he spoke to the crowds in St Peter's Square, CBS News reports.Â

Despite efforts from aides to tempt the boy off the stage with promises of sweets, he refused to budge.

Apparently unperturbed by the huge audience, the boy happily stood next to Pope Francis and then hugged his leg.

The Pontiff responded by patting him on the head and carrying on with his speech.

Then the bold youngster waved at the crowd and even led one girl up to receive a gift before sitting himself in the Pope's chair to the amusement of onlookers.
