Cameroon's World Cup squad will finally make their flight to Brazil on Sunday evening after originally refusing to board an earlier flight in a strike over their payment for the tournament, according to reports.

The team stayed back at their hotel in Yaounde while reporters camped outside the Cameroon Football Federation headquarters for further information.

A charter plane was due to leave Yaounde at 0900 GMT for Brazil, where Cameroon play their opening game of the tournament against Mexico on Friday.
