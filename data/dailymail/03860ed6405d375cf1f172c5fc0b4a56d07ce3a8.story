America and Russia yesterday agreed a 
deal to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons and promised UN sanctions if 
President Bashar al-Assad fails to comply.

Syria
must hand over a complete list of its estimated 1,000 tons of chemical 
weapons within a week, leading to their complete destruction in the 
first half of 2014 in the deal agreed by US Secretary of State John 
Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Assad
will be told to give full access to international weapons inspectors as
they search for stockpiles of deadly substances such as sarin – which 
experts believe caused more than 1,400 deaths in an attack on Damascus 
last month.

Agreement: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, shake hands yesterday after making a deal over Syria following three days of negotiations

Speaking in Geneva, Kerry said: ‘There can be no games, no room for avoidance, or anything less than full compliance.’

Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the agreement and called on Russia to ensure the success of the deal.

‘The international community, including Russia, must hold the regime to account. 

'The priority must now be a full and prompt implementation of the agreement,’ he said.

Deadline: Assad, pictured, is thought to hold about 1,000 tons of chemical agents and precursors, details of which must be handed over by September 21

But Syrian opposition groups criticised the deal, calling it a stalling measure.

General Salim Idriss, who is based in northern Syria, pledged to continue fighting Assad’s regime.

The UK has been providing non-lethal aid to these groups including satellite phones, radios and body armour.

The deal, secured after three days of negotiations, included an agreement of the extent of Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal.

President Assad’s billionaire uncle was yesterday facing corruption charges in Paris relating to his property empire. 

Rifaat
al-Assad, 76, the ‘Butcher of Hama’ who allegedly ordered the massacre 
of 25,000 people in 1982, has homes in France, Britain and Spain. He is 
accused of embezzlement and money-laundering within an organised gang. 

According
to a complaint lodged by anti-corruption groups: ‘It is likely that 
some or all of the assets of Rifaat al-Assad are the product of acts of 
corruption.’

It estimated Assad holds about 1,000 tons of chemical agents and precursors. Details of these must be provided by September 21.

Their removal will be supervised by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). 

Teams
of UN and OPCW inspectors are expected to begin their searches in 
November, with the Syrian regime responsible for their security.

The US and Russia remain divided over military action should Assad fail to comply.

At
yesterday’s press conference, Lavrov insisted that the agreement 
reached with  the US ‘said nothing about the use of force, all 
violations should be approved by the Security Council’.
