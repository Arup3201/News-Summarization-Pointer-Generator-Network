Gus Poyet believes his players are now convinced by his methods after their Tyne-Wear derby victory.

The Uruguayan had spoken just a week earlier about being ‘bored’ and ‘frustrated’ with his team after a run of five draws in six matches.

But Poyet feels the players have bought into his vision and says the 1-0 win at St James’ Park can prove a turning point in his tenure.

‘The players are convinced now,’ he said. ‘I know we had that bad day at Southampton (8-0 defeat) and that will be there all of my life.

‘But the players are confident that what we’re doing is working. We just needed a win.

‘This now is confirmation of what we do. I’m still thinking we need to improve because I don’t want any more draws. I want to win football games.’

Sunday’s victory – achieved thanks to Adam Johnson’s last-minute strike – was just their third maximum return of the season, while they have drawn 10 times.

And Poyet added: ‘You need to start somewhere. First, I want my team to be solid. We conceded like 2,000 goals last season in the first part of the season.

‘I want us first to be difficult to beat, then you start playing and taking chances.

‘But how long does that take? I still want to see more, I don’t change because of this one game. I’m ambitious – that’s the mentality I want.

‘The next game is the most important. Last year when we won the derby we didn’t think the next game was important and we went two months without winning a game.

‘I’m going to fight until the players have that mentality, that only the next game matters.

‘That’s what I want to see now. I don’t expect them to play like Bayern Munich – it’s about being the same team but with the confidence to produce those special moments.’

Johnson’s special moment in stoppage-time was his third goal on Tyneside in as many seasons. The former England winger has been below his best so far in this campaign, but Poyet hopes that derby glory can prove a catalyst for an upturn in his form.

‘We need moments to make the team believe in what we’re doing is working. Johnno showed that,' he said.

‘Last year he was brilliant in January, maybe that will come a little bit earlier this time.

‘This season we’ve been asking him to do too many things in defence – he has been too far from the opposition goal.

‘The responsibility is 50-50 – some of it mine because of the way we play, the other half is with the player and when he gets the chance he needs to produce.

‘You don’t score away from home in a derby three years in a row if you’re bad, no, he’s a special player.

‘This will help him a lot. I would say he will be very good over the next few games now.’
