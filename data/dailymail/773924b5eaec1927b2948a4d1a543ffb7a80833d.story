Heyday: Olivia Newton-John, seen in Grease as Sandy Olsson, has announced a series of UK tour dates

When she last hit these shores as a beautiful young starlet, the world was dancing to Greased Lightning.

More than three decades later, Olivia Newton-John will return for her first UK concert tour since 1978.

Now aged 64, the singer may no longer be able to pass herself off as John Travolta’s high-school sweetheart.

But she has not lost the striking blonde hair or figure that once set male pulses racing.

The Australian – who was born in England - was already 29 when she starred as 17-year-old Sandy Olsson in iconic musical Grease.

Miss Newton-John will tour seven arenas nationwide from March 10 next year.

With performances at London’s O2 Arena and the Royal Albert Hall she clearly expects even bigger audiences than last time.Her
last five-date tour of the country – part of 1978’s worldwide Totally 
Hot tour – saw her perform in the Dominion Theatre in London and the 
Apollo in Birmingham.

Miss Newton-John recently denied rumours she became romantically involved with Travolta, now 58, when they acted in Grease.

She said: ‘The truth was we were just good friends and used to hang around together, going for drinks or a meal.

‘But there was nothing in it. He still remains a friend today.’

Grease is the word: Olivia Newton-John, right, and left with John Travolta in the smash-hit film, has said she and her Grease co-star remain friends to this day

The star became famous as a singer years before the film became a box office hit.

In a 40-year career, she has sold more than 100million albums and won four Grammy Awards.

Between 1974 and 1976, she released a record of seven consecutive number one singles.

Her best known hit, Physical, topped the charts for ten consecutive weeks in 1981.

But Miss Newton-John’s musical career waned as she started to be compared with younger artists.

She cancelled a 1992 comeback tour after being diagnosed with breast cancer.

After having a partial mastectomy she concentrated on campaigning for better rainforest conservation, published cookery books and set up a health spa in Australia.

Earlier this month, it was announced she will release a Christmas album with Travolta this year.

Miss Newton-John lives in California with her husband, businessman John Easterling.
