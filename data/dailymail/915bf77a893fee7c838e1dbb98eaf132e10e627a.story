Missing: Office worker Frankie Warren, 26, vanished from her home in Gloucester on Wednesday

Officers searching for missing office worker Frankie Warren have found a body, police have said.

The body, which has not been identified, was found in woodland in Sedgley, near Dudley, West Midlands, at about 7pm last night.

Frankie, who vanished from her home in Thornbury. Gloucester, on Wednesday, has no links to the West Midlands area, it has been reported.

A West Midlands Police spokesman confirmed the discovery was not being treated as suspicious and has been referred to a coroner.

Police tracked Frankie's silver Honda Civic using number plate recognition cameras and yesterday discovered the abandoned vehicle near woodland, in Sedgley, 80 miles away from her home.

The 26-year-old did not take any belongings or money with her and friends said she had only £20 worth of petrol in her car.

Chief Superintendent Stuart Johnson of West Midlands Police said on Twitter this morning: 'Tragic conclusion to yesterday's major search operation in Sedgley. Our thoughts are with the deceased's family as we report to the coroner.

'Thank you to all the residents in the Sedgley Hall Park area for their support as officers carried out the open ground search.'

Sedgley Gornal Police tweeted: 'We are sad to say a body has been found in the search for Frankie Warren. Not confirmed identity yet but further details to follow.'

A Facebook group set up called Frankie Warren Still Missing has nearly 7,500 likes so far and has a message posted from her best friend.

The post said: 'Please everyone she is my absolute world a true best friend and this is so out of character as she would never want to cause us any upset! Please don't give up just keep sharing as we just can't rest without knowing of her whereabouts!'

Factory worker Kevin Fletcher, 46, said he first saw the car parked near the wooded area in Sedgley early on Thursday morning, but thought nothing of it.

Fears: Police, relatives and friends have been searching for Ms Warren, seen left and right with her boyfriend Sam Cotton, whose car was found abandoned in a secluded area in the West Midlands yesterday evening

'I thought the door doesn't look like it's shut properly,' he said.

'But I didn't think anything else of it because it was raining and a horrible morning. Apparently the keys were still in the car and her handbag was on the passenger seat.'

Mr Fletcher described seeing police with sniffer dogs descend on the area on Thursday evening.

'They asked me not to let Coco off the lead, there must have been about ten of them with dogs,' he said.

'I could hear the police helicopter as well, it looked like it had the infra-red on. It must have hovered over the fields for about 20 or 30 minutes.'

Search: Police recovered a vehicle from Elan Road in Sedgley during the search for missing Frankie Warren

Police arrived at the wooded area after tracking Ms Warren's car using number plate recognition cameras.

Ms Warren did not take any belongings with her when she left her house on Wednesday morning, and friends said she had only £20 worth of petrol in her car.

Her last contact with her boyfriend, Sam Cotton, 27, was at 11am on Wednesday.

Mr Cotton posted an emotional plea for information on his Facebook page the day his girlfriend went missing.

He
wrote: 'MY GIRLFRIEND (FRANKIE WARREN) HAS GONE MISSING!!!!!! I last 
spoke with her at about 11am on 29th May, this is massively out of 
character for her and also not to contact anyone!!!!'

He added: 'I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BABY!!!!! We all just want you home safe!!!!'

Concern: Police have been searching the area near Sedgley Hall Park, 80 miles from Ms Warren's home in Bristol

Mr Cotton has since posted an update to say he had travelled to Sedgley to join in the search.

A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset Police said: 'Her family, and the police officers searching for her, are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare because of her state of mind when she left.

'Since Frankie was reported missing we have been conducting enquiries to try and find her.

'As a result of those enquiries, her silver Honda Civic was found by West Midlands Police near some woodland in Sedgley at around 6.50pm on Thursday evening.

'A large search of the area took place by officers from West Midlands Police and will begin again at first light on Friday morning.

'Frankie is a white woman, 5' 8" tall and with a slim build.

'She has a pieced left nostril, blue eyes and straight blonde hair and was last seen wearing a blue tracksuit with full-length jogging bottoms with a white waist cord and a white logo on the leg.

'She had a light-grey hooded tracksuit top and a quilted jacket made of brown, shiny material and a fur-trimmed hood.

'Anyone who has seen Frankie since she went missing, or knows where she currently is, should contact police on 101.'
