An eight-year-old girl who was diagnosed with terminal cancer, has become the first person in the world to overcome her illness.

Claudia Burkill, from Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, had been battling metastatic pineoblastoma since the age of five, and her parents were told on several occasions she only had weeks left.

However, parents Andrea and David were told the good news this weekend - exactly three years to the day since Mrs Burkill first phoned a hospital about her daughter's health.

Metastatic pineoblastoma is an extremely rare form of cancer and has a survival rate of less than five per cent worldwide.

Claudia underwent an experimental Italian treatment at Nottingham Children’s Hospital, involving 44 gruelling sessions of radiotherapy.

Writing on her daughter's Facebook page 'Claudia's Cause' this weekend, Mrs Burkill said: ‘Claudia is cancer-free and no longer classed as terminally ill.

‘A miracle has happened, it really has. I just can't stop shaking.’

Doctors only see three or four cases of metastatic pineoblastoma a year of the condition for which there is still no known cure.

Claudia first became ill in June 2011 when the family returned after a holiday and she began vomiting.

Against the odds: Claudia's parents were told several times during the years of battling the brain cancer that their daughter only had weeks to live

After first being told she had a virus, a second visit to Lincoln County Hospital and several tests, including a CT-scan, a lumbar puncture and an MRI, saw doctors diagnose her with a squint.

Mrs
 Burkill was not satisfied with the diagnosis and after having Claudia 
transferred to Queens Medical Centre Nottingham, the lethal tumour was 
found at the centre of her brain.

Over the following years, Mr and Mrs Burkill were told on four occasions that Claudia only had weeks to live and they had to start planning her funeral.

She is now no longer terminally ill and the latest MRI scan showed that Claudia is in the clear.

Although she has suffered some brain damage from the treatment, her family are positive that her health will continue to improve.

Mrs Burkill said: ‘We had lived with a terminal diagnosis with death believed to be imminent for a crazy 694 days.

‘Today
 is the very first day in a very long time that I can look into the eyes
 of our four stunning children and “know” that I don't have to plan the 
funeral of one of them in the very near future.'

She added: ‘Today is our first day of freedom, a freedom so far lost and forgotten.

‘The mere joy of being alive today far surpasses any other single day in my live so far.

‘There are no signs of any tumour, any leptomeningeal spread or any recurrent disease, anywhere.

‘We are the luckiest people in this world - Claudia is believed to be the very first little girl in the world ever to survive metastatic pineoblastoma.

‘She has paid a high price, we all have, however, she does have her life and we are dedicated to making the very best that it can be for her.

‘A life where she can experience love, joy and happiness in abundance and be cherished always.’
