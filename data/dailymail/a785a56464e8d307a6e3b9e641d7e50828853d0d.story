Courtney Lawes insists England fans will see a changed man at Twickenham on Saturday as he believes controlling his recklessness will preserve his career.

The 26-year-old Northampton lock returns to Stuart Lancaster’s starting line-up against Scotland after recovering from ankle surgery in January and will be charged with running the line-out.

Renowned as one of the world’s most physical players, Lawes has suffered several injuries since making his England debut aged 20 and the son of a nightclub bouncer accepts he needs to choose his battles.

‘If I’m reckless then I’ll probably hurt myself which is why I keep a lid on things these days,’ said Lawes, who will win his 37th cap.

‘I’ve always been pretty chilled but when you’re younger, frustrations can get the better of you and you can be a bit rash. I’ve matured. I know I’m not made of steel.’

Lawes replaces George Kruis in the second row for the Calcutta Cup clash.

The 26-year-old, working hard on Wednesday at England HQ, will win his 37th cap at Twickenham
