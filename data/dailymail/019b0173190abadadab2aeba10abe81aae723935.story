Paul Scholes believes English football has declined to such an extent that Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich would win the Premier League by 10 to 15 points.

Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City all exited the Champions League in the last 16, while Everton's defeat to Dynamo Kiev in the Europa League meant a total wipeout of the English sides in Europe.

And Scholes, the former Manchester United midfielder who twice lifted the European Cup, has entered the debate on why English clubs are so inferior to their continental counterparts.

Writing in The Independent, Scholes said: 'Over the last two weeks our coaches and players in the Champions League have looked second rate.

'If you put one of Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the Premier League, they would win it by 10 to 15 points.

'Even PSG and Juventus look better sides than any of those currently at the top of the Premier League.'

While some have blamed the lack of a winter break for English failings, Scholes puts it down simply to inferior players.

Scholes played 134 European matches during his career, scoring on 26 occasions

'The bottom line to this season's failings? I think the big two in Spain, and Bayern, simply have better players than the English teams in the Champions League,' he writes.

Barcelona completed their win over Man City this week, with Lionel Messi to the fore, while French sides Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco eliminated Chelsea and Arsenal respectively.
