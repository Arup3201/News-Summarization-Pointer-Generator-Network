Manchester United teenager James Wilson reminded Louis van Gaal of his huge potential by hitting all four goals in a 4-1 win over rivals Manchester City in the Manchester Senior Cup Final on Thursday night.

Wilson scored twice on his Premier League debut against Hull City last season under interim manager Ryan Giggs but wasn't taken by Van Gaal on the club's recent pre-season tour of America.

But in front of watching City manager Manuel Pellegrini, Wilson turned the Senior Cup final in Hyde on its head with clinical finishing in each half after United had fallen behind.

Subs not used: O'Hara, Harrop, Goss, Willock, Evans

Goals: Wilson (4).

Attendance: 3,261. 

Patrick Vieira's City youngsters took the lead in front of an impressive crowd of 3,261 when Andy Cole's son Devante set up Jordi Hiwula to score.

But after that it was the Wilson show.

He levelled on the stroke of half-time and then twice breached the City defence to score early in the second half

His first dunked a finish past goalkeeper Angus Gunn, son of former Norwich City No 1 Bryan, and then side footed for his hat-trick. He added a fourth late on.

Wilson, 18, is tipped to be the next United youngster after Adnan Januzaj to emerge from the club's famed youth ranks and follow in the footsteps of The Busby Babes and Class of '92.

Van Gaal will probably consider sending Wilson on loan to The Championship or League One to gain competitive first-team experience.

It was the 28th time United had lifted the Senior Cup and it means the club have won two trophies in Van Gaal's first three weeks at the club.
