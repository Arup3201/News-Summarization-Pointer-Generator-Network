A real life 'Rosie the Riveter' who worked on a shipyard during World War II sneaked a kiss on the lips from President Obama during an official visit to the White House.

The kiss took place when the original six 'Rosie the Riveters' made a visit to Washington in the hopes of fulfilling one of their dreams, which was actually getting a hug from Joe Biden.

But the ladies got a bit more than they 
bargained for, when in addition to the Vice President, President Obama entered the oval office, 
before hugging and kissing the ladies in a row.

But one of the Riveter's, as shown in 
the video, decided to set her sights solely on Obama, heading in for a 
kiss on the lips rather than a straightforward peck on the cheek.

Obama shares a tender moment with one of the Rosie the Riveters who was visiting the White House

Biden and Obama politely hugged and kissed all of the real life 'Rosie the Riveters', but one decided to go the extra mile and plant one on Obama's lips

Phyllis Gould said: 'Oh my gosh, it was wonderful.

'I had written a letter to the Vice President and in it I said my dream would be to have my picture taken 
with the two of them in the Oval Office, and I got it.

'The president and vice president came bursting out of a room and grabbed me and then hugged everyone.'

Another Riveter said President Obama 'kissed all of us' during his meeting with the women, with another adding 'And Biden did too!'

Obama's entrance to the room they had been meeting in was a surprise to the women, who had been invited to Washington D.C for a week to meet Vice President Joe Biden

Phyllis Gould had been writing letters to the White House for 12 years in the hopes of meeting the president, because she felt her and her fellow Riveters weren't being given enough credit for their services during the war, amid fears that they wouldn't be around for much longer.

She finally got her letters answered when vice president Joe Biden invited them to the White House for a personal meet and greet, and a week trip to Washington D.C.

She told ABC News: 'All the military had monuments and recognition and we didn’t get any.

'In the schools 
they’re not even teaching about World War II, so if anybody’s going to 
remember us, I wanted to be a big bang here — and we’re having it.

'They were on the battlefield but we were on the home front.

'The war wouldn't have been won without us.'

The Riveters who visited the White House, made famous by the iconic poster seen throughout the war, were welders, electricians and drafters at the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California, during WWII.

One of the 'Rosies', 91-year-old Phyllis
 Gould, from California, prompted the visit by writing a letter to the 
vice president and explaining it was their dream to meet the president 
and vice president.

They spoke of their experiences during the war fondly, but also explained that they were just young ladies trying to make the best of it at the time.

Mrs Gould said: 'I was 20 years old and I was having fun.

'I can claim I was patriotic, but that isn’t quite the way I remember it.

'I was but other things were taking priority such as fancy underwear and Frank Sinatra records.

When asked if there would be a monument made in their honor, one Riveter exclaimed, 'We hope so!'

Regarding a possible statue, Mrs Gould joked: 'That’s the next thing we’ll work on.'

Before they head home, they will be having an intimate meeting with the vice president to round off the visit.

'We’re having breakfast tomorrow morning with Vice President Biden at his home. said one Riveter.

Mrs Gould added: 'And he says he’s got more stuff planned for us but it’s a secret, it will be a surprise!'.

President Obama, who surprised the ladies with his visit, said: 'These ladies all remind me of my grandmother.

'My grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line while my grandfather was off in the army.

'So I'm very proud to be here.'

Biden said he decided to have the women to the White House being he wanted to honor their service.

He said: 'This was the start of the real women's liberation.

'These women, working in the factory doing anything any man could do, it began to change everything.

'What fundamentally changed the war was our ability to make more aircraft, more landing craft, and other equipment.

'We needed them badly and they just stepped up.'
