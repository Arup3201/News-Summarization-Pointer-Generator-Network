A remarkable six weeks in the life of Andy Murray started with a controversial tweet, has contained a sustained surge in form and is set to end with qualification for London's season-end finale next month.

His opening match in the Paris Masters, versus Frenchman Julien Benneteau on Wednesday, will come 41 days after he more than hinted at his support for Scottish independence - and in the intervening time he has won eighteen matches and three ATP titles.

The inevitable reaction to his last gasp, ultimately futile intervention in the referendum debate is clearly not something he wants to dwell on. While he doubts the whole episode sparked something inside of him – winning is always the best way to regain whatever lost popularity - he admits that is one conclusion to draw.

The win in Spain was the third tournament victory for Murray in less than six weeks

'I don't know, I personally haven't looked at it like that, but results could suggest that,' said Murray on Tuesday, contemplating his swift rise to become the year's fifth best player to date.

He admitted that the first tournament of this run, at Shenzen in China, was particularly difficult as he successfully strove to win a first title since Wimbledon 2013 after leaving a storm behind at home. 

Yet the main reasons for his late season improvement lie more prosaically in increased faith in his body and confidence from winning.

'It (Shenzen) was a tough week for a number of reasons,' he said. 'But I knew that after the US Open I needed to start winning again and that's why I said I wanted to start playing tournaments, whether smaller or not. 

'If I wasn't beating guys that were inside the top 20 in the world I didn't care, I just wanted to win. Then I started beating top-level opposition, which I wasn't early in the year.

 Murray says confidence has come from 'winning a lot of tough, long, close matches, especially the finals'

'It's been a long six weeks, but it's been very beneficial for me. I gained a lot of confidence in my body again from playing this much, and then also from winning a lot of tough, long, close matches, especially the three finals.' 

He explained his comments at Flushing Meadows, where he had sounded indifferent about qualifying for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena. 

'I wasn't thinking much at the Open, I was just more interested in trying to get myself back into the top eight players in the world, because for the seedings at the major events at the beginning of next year it makes a big difference.'

The price has been paid in physical pain and the accumulation of miles around China and Europe. The most severe reaction followed his epic win in Sunday's Valencia Open final against Tommy Robredo.

'My whole body was sore, my back, my hips just aching, and I was cramping too in the final so the muscles hurt. Ice baths make a huge difference, my body feels different once I've been in one, after the ceremony on Sunday night we got in the ice bath back at the hotel before flying here, and the aches and pains sort of calmed down.

'I've been feeling really bad in the evenings but waking up in the mornings feeling pretty good. My body is clearly getting used to playing matches and recovering well, which at the beginning of the year wasn't the case. In my first event in January I was in bits after playing for an hour.'

How his system reacts against Benneteau is hard to predict, but the points on offer would be useful for achieving the feasible goal of finishing this year ranked No 4. As far as London qualification is concerned, all the mathematics this week are on his side.
