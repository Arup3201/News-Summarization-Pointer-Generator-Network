A passenger who was concentrating on his iPad and not where he was going, sparked a terminal evacuation of hundreds of travellers after a security breach at Sydney Airport, Qantas says. 

Passengers were evacuated at Sydney Airport on Saturday morning after a man walked into the terminal without passing through security screening.

A Qantas spokeswoman said a man by-passed security screening by walking through an exit passage in Terminal three.

'The man disembarked a flight and left. It appears he wasn't paying attention, was looking at his iPad, forgot something and walked back past (the security area),' the Qantas spokeswoman said.

'He has departed now.' 

Passengers take to Twitter after a security scare that sparked a terminal evacuation of hundreds of travellers

David Hall took to his Twitter page saying: 'Sydney Airport in lockdown after security breach...'

Adam Vincenzini said: 'Security breach at Sydney Airport. Flights on ground de-boarded. Terminals emptied'

Security officials were searching for the man after they saw the incident on CCTV cameras.

The spokeswoman said as a precaution, all passengers were moved out of the terminal and had to undergo screening again.

A Qantas spokeswoman said the delay only lasted about an hour, although any ardent Sydney Swans fans travelling to Melbourne for the AFL grand final this afternoon probably broke into a sweat.

A Sydney Airport Corporation spokesman said no other domestic or international terminals have been affected by the breach.
