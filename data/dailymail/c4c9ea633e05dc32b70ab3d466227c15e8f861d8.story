Southampton are considering Lorient centre-back Bruno Ecuele Manga, 25, as they consider their next move with wantaway defender Dejan Lovren.

The club are drawing up contingency plans in case they are forced into a climb down over Dejan Lovren.

Southampton are making plans to rebuild their squad and don't intend to sell Lovren even if he goes on strike.

Head gone: Dejan Lovren is ready to join Liverpool after criticising Southampton  

However, ultimately that may not prove healthy for the club. Liverpool are threatening to move on to other targets if there is no change on Lovren soon.

Manga ironically was a player watched by Liverpool last year. The 25-year-old Gabon international was also a target for Everton.

This time round, Borussia Monchengladbach and Lazio are also monitoring Manga who was Laurent Koscielny's replacement.
