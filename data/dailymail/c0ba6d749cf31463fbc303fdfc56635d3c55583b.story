West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has revealed he received a congratulations text message from Jose Mourinho moments after his side sealed a 2-1 win over Manchester City. 

Mourinho, whose side face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, would have been keeping a close eye on proceedings at Upton Park as Manchester City are thought to be Chelsea's biggest title rivals. 

Allardyce and Mourinho clashed last season after the Portuguese tactician said West Ham play '19th century football' to which the Hammers boss responded by saying he 'out-tacticed' the Special One.

Chelsea could go eight points clear if they can claim all three points against Manchester City

West Ham's victory means Chelsea could stretch their lead over the champions to eight points if they can come away from Old Trafford with all three points. 

Allardyce, speaking to broadcasters beIN Sport, said: 'Jose has just texted me to say "Well done big man".

'This shows how important it was for him, never mind us.

'He goes to Manchester United knowing his team will go and perform at their best and if they win it makes the gap even bigger. 

'The result wasn't for him. It was for us and everyone at West Ham. It will benefit him if they go and get a result at Manchester United.'
