She is normally seen with horses rather than hounds, but Zara Phillips took time out from equestrian duties to give this tiny pooch some puppy love.

The 33-year-old could be seen smiling as she picked up and petted the tiny pug while she was attending the Burghley Horse Trials in Stamford, Lincolnshire today. 

It is understood the dog, called Winston, was a pet belonging to a member of the public at the event which runs until tomorrow.

Puppy love: Zara Phillips made friends with a tiny pug dog while she was attending Burghley Horse Trials in Stamford, Lincolnshire this weekend

Her appearance at the Trials came as she told of her struggle to get fit for competition again after months out of the saddle while she was having her first child.

The Olympic medal winner and Queen's granddaughter gave birth to daughter Mia in January, and said she got on a horse for the first time afterwards five weeks later.

She told the Telegraph Weekend: 'I've never not ridden for that long and never not been that fit for that long either, so it was hard trying to get each muscle group to... remember what they used to do.

As well as making friends with Winston the dog, Zara Phillips could be seen sampling some of the local food on offer at the event this weekend, including this cupcake

'It is quite frustrating. You've got to accept it really.'

The eventing champion described motherhood as an 'amazing' experience but admitted she had not been particularly maternal previously.

'I wouldn't have had to pick up a baby before I had a baby, but I think it does change when you've got your own,' she said.

'It is amazing, and she's been very good, so I think I'm quite lucky.'

The 33-year-old, who is married to rugby player Mike Tindall, said she does not have a nanny, describing herself as a 'full-time mother' as well as a professional sportswoman.

But she joked of her firstborn: 'I'm going to keep her away from horses and rugby!'

She has enjoyed a triumphant return to competing after finishing in 11th place individually at the World Equestrian Games in France last month, while the Great Britain team took silver.
