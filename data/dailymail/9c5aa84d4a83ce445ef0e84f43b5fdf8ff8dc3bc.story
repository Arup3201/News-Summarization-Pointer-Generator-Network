It may look udderly ridiculous, but an airlift was the only way to get these cows to safety after they became trapped in a river.

The herd of eight young cows left the safety of their meadow in the Canton of Graubunden in eastern Switzerland and headed for the water.

It quickly turned into a drama when they decided to go to the other side of the river where the grass was of course greener.

Moo-ve along: A helicopter hovers above the river in Graubunden in Switzerland and hoists one of the cows in to the air as rescuers watch on from below. The animals had been trying to reach 'greener grass' on the other side when they became trapped

But halfway across they became marooned on a sandbank in the river that began flowing much faster after a downpour.

The rescuers put the foolishness down to the fact all the animals were young.

In
 the end they had to be helicoptered into the air and lowered onto the 
bank where they had come from.

The animals were calmed down with 
tranquillisers to stop them struggling in the hoist, then hooked up to 
winches and airlifted to safety.

Udderly ridiculous: The animals wait their turn to be airlifted to safety after getting marooned in the middle of a large river in Switzerland. A total of eight animals had wandered into the water before coming to a halt on a rocky bank of stones

They
 were then taken back to their field where they were given a check up by
 a vet before being released. Despite being cold, they were otherwise unhurt in the ordeal.

The rescue took five hours, involved two helicopters, four vets, three farmers, and two patrols as well as two police divers.

'It
 cost a small fortune and far more than they were worth, but we couldn't
 let them simply be swept away,' said a police spokesman.

'No-one can 
bear to see animals in distress, even if it was their own fault that 
they got into trouble in the first place.

'After all, they didn't know 
any better.'

Hoofing it: The herd of eight young cows set off in to the river on the hunt for greener grass after escaping the safety of their own meadow. The animals were calmed down with tranquilizers to stop them struggling in the hoist, then hooked up to winches and airlifted to safety
