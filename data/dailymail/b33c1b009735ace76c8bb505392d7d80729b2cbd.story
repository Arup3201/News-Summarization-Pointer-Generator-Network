Motorists are being held to ransom by 1,000 militant tanker drivers who yesterday voted for a national strike.

The walkout, which threatens to wreck the Easter break, could close nearly 8,000 petrol stations.

Army personnel are being trained to drive the tankers and are on standby to maintain essential supplies.

Remember this? Long queues at the pumps during the strike in 2000. Such scenes look likely to be repeated after 1,000 militant tanker drivers voted yesterday for a national strike

But only a minority of union members 
voted for the strike.

Unite, the union led by  militant Len McCluskey, 
balloted members at seven major haulage and oil companies in a dispute 
over pay and conditions for drivers.

Across these organisations, the union has 2,062 members.

But only 1,001 voted in favour of 
striking – 48.5 per cent.

The union achieved its slender 55 per cent 
majority for strike action because 12 per cent of members failed to 
vote.

London Mayor Boris Johnson yesterday 
renewed his demand for a change in the law to make strikes illegal 
unless at least half the union members vote in favour.

The strike could begin as soon as next
Tuesday – April  3.

Unite is the Labour party’s biggest financial 
backer, and Ed Miliband has been urged to condemn the strike. But so far
he has remained silent.

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: 
‘Today’s vote is very disappointing news for hard-working families and 
businesses who will be inconvenienced by this unnecessary and 
irresponsible strike.

‘Ed Miliband must condemn this strike and get Labour’s biggest trade union paymaster round the negotiating table.’

Unite has warned the strike will lead 
to 7,900 petrol stations closing, as the firms it balloted supply 90 per
cent of the total.

Five of the seven drivers’ depots voted for a 
strike.

But drivers at DHL, which has the largest number of Unite members, voted against.

The results for the seven companies involved in the ballot are:

And members at JW Suckling 
overwhelmingly voted against strike action.

Its managing director Peter 
Larner told the Daily Mail: ‘Our [pay and conditions] agreement for 2012
was supervised by Unite but they still chose to ballot our drivers.

The
union then claimed we had refused to sit down with them, which just 
isn’t true.

We have met with them and other companies several times.

'I 
really don’t know what this strike is about as we have agreed our 
standards with the union.’

One industry source told the Mail: ‘This is all about the ego of one union leader who is picking a political fight.

‘If this was really about pay and conditions and safety, they would be balloting the smaller firms who do things on the cheap.’

Mr McCluskey is known as the most Left-wing union leader and is a controversial figure even within Unite.

The looming protests serve as a 
reminder of September 2000, when the petrol blockade brought the nation 
to its knees. 

Convoys of truckers and farmers blockaded refineries, 
preventing the vital flow of fuel and forcing prices higher.

Business leaders yesterday warned a strike would be bad news for firms.

Simon Walker, director general of the 
Institute of Directors, said: ‘A tanker drivers’ strike threatens to 
clog the arteries of the economy.

'The vast majority of travel in Britain
takes place on the roads.’

John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, 
said: ‘This vote should disappoint us all. Disruption is in nobody’s 
interest at this critical moment in the recovery.’

Unite will decide in the next 24 to 48 hours whether to set a date for strikes.

Diana Holland, the union’s assistant 
general secretary, said: ‘These votes send a clear message through- out 
the industry and should prompt all the major  companies to get around 
the table to establish mini- mum standards.’

The union claims safety has been 
compromised since fuel companies outsourced petrol deliveries to 
‘squeeze profits and win contracts’.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the 
strike was ‘wrong and unnecessary’ but added that the Government had 
‘robust resilience and contingency plans’ to deal with one.
