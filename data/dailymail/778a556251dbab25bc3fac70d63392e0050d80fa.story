After being call all kinds of names and had their industry demonized, it doesn't come as an exact shock to hear that the country's wealthy are donating the least to the Occupy Wall Street protests.

Online fundraising site WePay said that people earning over $250,000 have only donated 1.39 per cent of the cause's cash, falling very closely in line with their representation as the country's wealthiest one per cent.

This news comes as protesters face increased police opposition across the country.

Getting handouts: Donations of cash and various food have helped sustain protesters who are staying in New York's Zuccotti Park

The site has accumulated a total of $325,000 to the protesters, with the majority coming from the self-proclaimed middle class.

People that decided to make donations online were asked by the site to give their annual income to allow for demographic analysis. Of those donations, 60 per cent were given by people who claim that they make between $35,000 and $100,000.

'The middle class is really giving the bulk of the money,' said Bill Clerico, the CEO of WePay.

'In the last 30 days, donations have really snowballed as more movements have joined Occupy Wall Street,' he continued.

The donations are spread across the 
country and the world, as sympathizers in 36 different countries, 
including Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates.

All 50 states are financially 
represented, and the geographic break down helps to paint a clearer 
picture of where the country stands on the movement.

Connecticut residents have given the 
most, with the average donation coming in at $65.15, with Hawaii and New
Jersey following suit staying within a dollar above and below the $60 
mark respectively.

North Dakota had the lowest average donation with only $16.25, and Arkansas came in second to last with $20.50.

Interestingly, those figures fall 
along party lines: the three highest paying states voted for the 
Democratic Barack Obama in the 2008 while Nebraska and Arkansas voted 
for John McCain, the Republican nominee.

Staying power: Though many protests have come since the original, New York seems to have the most momentum as they hit the one month mark on October 17

Anniversary dates- like New York's one
month mark on October 17- and big media spectacles- often caused by 
police violence- prompt more people to open the purse strings, serving 
as big money days for the site.

Given the weekend's incidents at some protests, it seems like there will be many more of those days to come.

A tense standoff between Occupy Denver
protesters and authorities near the Colorado Capitol erupted Saturday 
with a surge of demonstrators being met with police force that included 
pepper spray and rubber bullets.

The clash came as Occupy Wall Street 
protesters and state officials in Tennessee squared off for a third 
consecutive night Saturday, even though a local judge has refused to 
jail demonstrators who have been arrested and said the state lacks the 
authority to set a curfew on the property.

These violent blow ups come at the 
same time as groups of over 30 people were arrested in both Portland, 
Oregon and Austin, Texas in the late hours of Saturday night and early 
morning of Sunday.

In New York City, where the Occupy 
Wall Street movement began last month, a mix of snow, rain and slush 
made for sheer misery at the encampment in Zuccotti Park in lower 
Manhattan.

Drenched protesters hunkered down in tents and under tarps as the plaza filled with rainwater and melted snow.

Technically, tents are banned in the 
park, but protesters say authorities have been looking the other way, 
even despite a crackdown on generators that were keeping them warm.

'I want to thank the New York Police 
Department,' said 32-year-old protester Sam McBee, decked out in a 
yellow slicker and rain pants.

'We're not supposed to have tents. 
We're not supposed to have sleeping bags. You go to Atlanta, they don't 
have it. You go to Oakland, you don't have it. And we got it.'
