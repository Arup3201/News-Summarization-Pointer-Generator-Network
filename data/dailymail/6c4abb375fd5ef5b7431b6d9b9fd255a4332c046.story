The story of an abandoned puppy who was beaten so badly that he had to have his leg amputated has prompted donations of almost £18,000 for charity after users read about it on the internet.

Ralf, owned by Sue Utley, 66, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire has over 1,300 Facebook friends and his story has raised the substantial sum for Rain Rescue, the charity that rescued him.

He was found on Christmas Eve, 2012, savagely kicked and discovered dumped in the street, crying in agony.

Since having his leg amputated, little Ralf has become an internet sensation and raised around £18k for the charity that saved his life, Rain Rescue

A vet gave two heartbreaking options – the pup should either be put down or face a gruelling leg amputation. Experts couldn't be sure that the little dog would adapt to having just three legs. 

But he was given the chance, and today Ralf is an internet star who has even saved other pooches on doggie death row.

Owner Sue says: 'Ralf was just four months old when he was found dumped in the street in Rotherham by a volunteer from Rain Rescue, a local dog charity.

'I'd been a dog foster carer for them and offered to take him in for a while. The poor lad was in a bad way, crying in pain from an injury to his front leg.

Born fighter: Rain Rescue paid for Ralf to have his leg amputated from the knee down, but vets couldn't say how he would cope with life on three legs

Brutal: Ralf had been kicked so badly that it had shattered his left elbow and dislocated his right shoulder

'Ralf had been kicked which had shattered his left elbow and dislocated his right shoulder.

'I couldn't believe someone would hurt a puppy. The vet's news was stark - put him to sleep or operate.'

Rain Rescue paid for Ralf to have his leg amputated from the knee down, but no-one really knew how he would cope with life on three legs.

Mrs Utley said: 'I knew that Ralf would try to nibble at his stitches, so that day I bought him a baby's t-shirt to wear, meaning his stump would be covered up.'

She and her husband Pete, 67, found it tough watching Ralf struggling to walk.

'It took him ages to realise his old leg had been removed and he was constantly falling over. Eventually this caused a haematoma in his stump,' she says.

Sadly the vet then had to remove his shoulder, but luckily Ralf's feisty spirit pulled him through and Mrs Utley was smitten.

Sue Utley fostered Ralf and decided to set up a Facebook page in his name, uploading photos and sharing his escapades with his now 1,300 friends

Little charmer: Sue writes Ralf's Facebook updates in a broad Yorkshire accent allowing his mischievous character to shine through

'Fostering was supposed to be short term but as people offered to adopt him I just couldn't bear to let him go,' she said. 'He was such a character, always hiding things and getting up to mischief.'

She decided to set up a Facebook page in Ralf's name, uploading photos and sharing his escapades.

She wrote Ralf's updates in a broad Yorkshire accent and his personality shone through.

'Helped me mam with the dishes today,' he barked. 'She weren't happy though, shouted at me to get out the dishwasher and stop lickin' the plates.'

She also uploaded photographs of Ralf wearing his tiny t-shirts. As he grew, so did his collection.

She said: 'He had stripy ones, Superman ones, sailor boy ones.

'His Facebook friends loved seeing what he was wearing every day.

Ralf is now raising money for the charity Rain Rescue and helping save the lives of other animals

'Many of these dogs (in local dog pounds) are traumatised, injured, or sick and needing vet treatment,' says Sue, 'But thanks to Ralf and Rain Rescue they're alive.'

'Soon he was boasting nearly 2,000 friends and I decided to put his popularity to use and get him his own JustGiving page, meaning people could leave donations for Rain Rescue.'

To date, Ralf has raised nearly £18,000 and Mrs Utley could not be prouder.

'Ralf had been left to die on the streets, and now he's helping save the lives of other animals,' she said. 'He's a little hero. He may hobble about on three legs, but to me he's just perfect.

'He's saved the lives of dogs in death row who are in the local pounds, the ones that are due to be put to sleep.

'Many of these dogs are traumatised, injured, or sick and needing vet treatment.

'But thanks to Ralf and Rain Rescue they're alive.'
