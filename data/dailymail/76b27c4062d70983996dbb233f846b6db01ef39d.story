Aaron Ramsey is set to be confirmed among the growing band of footballers to be signed by sportswear firm Warrior.

The Arsenal midfielder, who has been sponsored by Adidas, is close to completing a lucrative boot contract with the US firm.

Warrior have identified Ramsey as a key capture in their client portfolio given his growing appeal and stature in the UK and Europe.

Ramsey signed a deal with a modelling firm Elite Model Management earlier this year, and is viewed as a perfect candidate to promote Warrior's brand and products.

Still viewed as a relatively new company in the world of football merchandising, Warrior are slowly bolstering their influence.

They already boost deals with Vincent Kompany, Marouane Fellaini and Tom Ince and are kit suppliers to Liverpool, Stoke, Porto and Sevilla.
