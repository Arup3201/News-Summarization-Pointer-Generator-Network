A NASCAR driver was smacked by a rival driver’s girlfriend.

Max Papis and Mike Skeen crashed Saturday during the last lap of a Camping World Truck Series race at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario. Mr Skeen’s apparently enraged girlfriend eventually caught up to Mr Papis and smacked him.

Despite the collision, both men finished the race – with Mr Papis coming in sixth and Mr Skeen finishing 13th, according to the LA Times.

Mr Papis blamed the collision on Mr Skeen in his post race interview.

'The six car [driven by Mr Skeen], I knew was going to do something, you know, not really sportsmanship, because that's what he did before... it was just an amateur move,' said Mr Papis.

Shortly after an on-camera interview in 
which the animated Mr Papis explained what happened, Kelly Heaphy can be
seen running up to the driver and smacking him across the face with her
right hand.

Mr Papis eventually claimed on Twitter the slap dislocated his jaw, but not before ribbing his foe with a few tweets.

Wham!: Ms Heaphy then winds up and unloads on Mr Papis, slapping him so hard she dislocated his jaw, he later claimed on Twitter

‘That deal was only between me and #6 driver we could have solved it alone ...but I guess he needed some ...help !!!!’ Mr Papis tweeted.

Shortly after blaming the accident on Mr Skeen, Mr Papis then tweeted ‘Just to make ull laugh #6 driver was such a chicken when I stop on his side ask to come out of car he lowered down his visor,#NOMAN’

Coincidentally, Mr Papis slapped another driver earlier this year, but his victim, Billy Johnson, still had his helmet on. That slap also came after an accident.

Johnson accepted fault for the accident after the race, but said of Mr Papis ‘I guess he was living up to his name 'Mad Max.'
