TV historian Tessa Dunlop first met her future husband while teaching in Romania when he was just a boy.

The 37-year-old who is probably best known for BBC2's popular programme Coast has also worked on history shows around the world.

She first traveled to the eastern European nation in 1993 while it was going through its shocking orphan crisis.

Fresh from having been rejected by Oxford University as an 18-year-old, she hoped the experience suggested by her father would boost a future Oxbridge application.

She ended up staying in Romania for 10-months, and it worked with a new application to study modern history at Oxford accepted.

But the huge impression the eastern European nation left on the teenager saw her return to Romania a year later to teach English.

It
 was during that second trip that she first met the brother of one of 
her students, who she has since married, but will only refer to as 
'Vlad', as he hates the limelight.

Dunlop is 'obsessive' about Romania and said 'I just think it's a f****** great country. I got so much from that year. I owe Romania.

'It gave me my balls; it gave me a lot of my identity; it gave me a whole fresh look at life.'

She found Oxford life 'pompous' while studying after the gritty basics she experienced while at the orphanage.

At the time Romania she had found shockingly poor conditions, and children so damaged they compulsively self-harmed.

The older children would fight with her and steal from her, but the contrast to her own sheltered upbringing left her felt needed and loved in a way she had never experienced before.

On her second trip to Romania when she met her future husband their romance was beyond the ordinary because Dunlop was 19 and Vlad was 12.

She was often invited to the family home for super and came to single out Vlad as a bright, canny child with an ear for language.

He started going to her English classes, becoming a top pupil, although she said at the time here interest was not romantic.

She said: 'Of course it never occurred to me that, you know... [but] I noticed a stillness in him, a peacefulness, I think is the word, that made him stand out.'

Keen to help her friend she organised a scholarship for Vlad to study at her former boarding school, Strathallan in Perthshire.

Dunlop didn't visit him while he was at the school, enjoying her own student life at Oxford, getting into rowing and boyfriends.

Vlad did well in class, and the school offered to sponsor him, but overwhelmed with homesickness, he decided to return to his family.

After graduating Dunlop moved to London, landing a job on talk radio station LBC in the 1990s, starting on the night-time shift.

She progressed well and was handed her own daytime show to present, but Romania remained in her thoughts.

She went to visit the country again, visiting Vlad's family again, and fell in love - he was 19, and she was 27-years-old.

She said: 'I just knew, it was like bang. We didn't kiss or anything but I just felt it.'

The age difference never felt wrong she said, and the pair kept in touch via email and then phone, spending up to £400 a month on calls.

The romance is detailed in her new book, To Romania With Love, her autobiography about their romance.

Happily married: Tessa Dunlop

She declines to reveal her husbands real name in the book because he hates the fact she has even written it.

Despite his concern it describes how when they were first together, Vlad seemed more interested in being a teenager, than with a London based radio presenter.

It was at that time that Dunlop's father, who she was very close to, was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer.

She distracted herself from the devastating blow by pouring even more energy into her obsession with Vlad - relentlessly worrying about his smoking.

Eventually her mother stepped in writing to him, asking him to give up tobacco because her daughter was so upset, and demonstrating some commitment, he did.

While Dunlop's father was mostly against the match, her mother favoured the young Romanian, and helped research how he could move to London.

They eventually married in Romania, and Dunlop's father who died in 2009, had finally accepted the union although it wasn't his ideal in his opinion.

More guilt about their pairing came from his family, with Vlad's mother sobbing at the wedding that her son was being stolen away with his move to Britain.

Despite the unusual start, family difficulties, cultural divide and long distance, the couple now have a three-year-old daughter Mara, who is fluent in English and Romanian.

Dunlop said: 'So, I fell in love with a younger man. So what? It happens all the time the other way around all the time. We were in love and we're still in love.'

To Romania with Love will be published by Quartet Books on May 31 at £12.
