Two University of Cambridge friends have become the first people ever to row the full length of the Amazon River - with the help of a Brazilian teenager.

Mark de Rond, 45, and Anton Wright, 38, overcame a series of challenges to complete the epic 2,077-mile journey in just 32 days.

Along the way they negotiated a stretch notorious for hostage taking known as Pirate Alley and a massive three-hour storm that destroyed their rudder.

Their adventure was nearly sunk before it even started when Peruvian customs officials seized their specialised boat.

The University of Cambridge pair eventually made it out of the airport only to find two gaping holes in the vessel's frame.

But on September 6 they set off from the Peruvian town of Nauta close to the Amazon's source.

Some days they rowed for 18 hours and at one stage they rested their boat on a sandbank only to realise they were perched on quicksand.

On another occasion they were caught in a storm and frantically fired flares into the night sky when they were saved by a 14-year-old Brazilian boy.

He reached them with his own boat and directed them to safety and a fortnight later they reached their finish in Macapa, Brazil.

Mark and Anton have now arrived back in Britain after entering the Guinness Book of World Records as the only men to row the giant river.

Anton said: 'I cannot imagine anyone will do it again. I hope they do. If they do they will have to work really hard.'

Dutch-born Mark is a student at the Cambridge Judge Business School while Anton, originally from Knutsford, in Cheshire, is the head coach of Clare College Rowing Club.Â
