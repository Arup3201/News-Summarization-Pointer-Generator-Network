'Confined': Valerie Trierweiler, partner of French President Francois Hollande, pictured in September last year. She remains in the care of a Paris hospital

Francois Hollande has finally gone to 
visit his First Lady in hospital – a week after revelations about his 
affair with an actress caused her to take ‘a pill too many’.

The 59-year-old President of France slipped into see Valerie Trierweiler, 48, under conditions of great secrecy this morning.

Today, more revelations about the length of the affair appeared in a magazine.

Closer ran another article saying the president had been seeing Julie Gayet for three years.

It
 portrays Mr Hollande as a ruthless and calculating love cheat, who has 
spent a large part of his time in power juggling two women.

The
 magazine adds that Miss Gayet met Mr Hollande in 2011 when Ségolène 
Royal – the mother of Mr Hollande's four children and his partner for 30
 years – supported the actress's political activism.

His
 visit to the central Paris hospital came exactly a week after his 
partner learned that Closer magazine was about to publish pictures of 
him 
leaving a love nest in the French capital.

He
 had been using it and at least two other properties to carry out a 
relationship with Miss  Gayet, 41, since 2011, the magazine claims.

Today, Mr Hollande’s aides also confirmed that he had seen Miss Trierweiler in person after spending the past week texting and calling her while she was being treated in hospital. 

The visit to see his partner came after his mistress phoned a Paris radio station and insisted: ‘I’m not pregnant’.

Media
 around the world had reported that Miss Gayet was four months pregnant.

Miss Gayet, normally a high-profile film actress, has been in hiding ever since the pictures appeared in Closer.

But Europe 1 radio station said she phoned them to deny the pregnancy claims, which first appeared on Twitter.

The
 scandal has caused outrage in France, where the Socialist politician’s 
bungling of the economy has led to the unemployment rate spiralling, 
along with the cost of living. 

The initial expose was broken last week after impeccably placed sources helped find the presidential love nest 
close to the Elysee Palace, his official residence in Paris. Closer pinpoints at least two others. They
 include another apartment to the west of Paris, and one in the Riviera 
resort of Mougins, where left-wing Mr Hollande controversially owns 
two private homes.

In July 
last year, the couple even enjoyed a break in Tulle, Mr Hollande's 
constituency in central France, while Miss Trierweiler was on holiday by
 herself in Greece and 'waiting for Mr Hollande to join her'.

Mr
 Hollande and Miss Gayet were seen wandering around the Tulle market 
place where, in 2012, Miss Trierweiler had triumphantly kissed Mr 
Hollande on his election as head of state.

Mr Hollande and Miss Gayet were also seen in a restaurant in Mougin, and in one in central Paris.

Photos
 taken of them by passers-by, and by a concierge who worked in the Paris
 office block where Miss Gayet has her production company office, were 
regularly kept out the public eye, says Closer.

Miss
 Gayet last year also issued a statement through her lawyers denying 
point blank that Mr Hollande was her lover – a claim which may come back
 to haunt if she now takes over as the new first lady.

Before her husband's visit today, Miss Trierweiler contacted a radio station
 in Paris to confirm that Mr Hollande had not visited her, 
preferring to send ‘chocolates and flowers’ as doctors had forbidden him from seeing her. 

'She
 doesn't want people to think he is neglecting her at such a painful 
time,' said a reporter for Paris radio station RTL who spoke to her.

'It
 was the doctors who had forbidden the head of state to visit her, it is
 a widespread practice in case of psychological distress.

'The patient is temporarily confined, kept at distance from their entourage to get better.'

Miss
 Trierweiler remains in the care of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, where 
she was admitted after first learning that Closer was to 
reveal details of Mr Hollande's affair.

'She
 is still very tired to the extent that she cannot stand up. Her blood 
pressure and morale are low but she hopes to leave with her head held 
high to and is prepared to fight, at least for her dignity,' said RTL.

Patrice
 Biancone, Miss Trierweiler's spokesman, yesterday told The Associated 
Press that she was making progress in her treatment.

'She has six days of rest behind her - that counts, after all,' he said, without elaborating.

An
 official in Mr Hollande's office, speaking on condition of anonymity 
because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Miss Trierweiler had been
 hospitalised for 'a crisis of nerves' after learning of the alleged 
affair a day before Closer hit newsstands.

That's
 a different explanation to the one given by Miss Trierweiler to RTL, 
and also to that given in the latest edition of Le Point, which claims 
she took 'one pill too many' because the 'cold and ruthless' Mr Hollande
 wanted to dump her.

It is 
claimed that while she did not want to commit suicide, she could not 
deal with details of the president's confession of 
his infidelity.

'She took a pill too many,' one source tells the Paris magazine. 'However, she never wanted to attempt suicide.'

Le
 Nouvel Observateur said 
Mr Hollande wanted to split up with Miss Trierweiler, but her sudden 
hospitalisation meant he could not.

'Francois Hollande had a dream but it only lasted the weekend,' said the left-wing weekly.

Mr
 Hollande had hoped, the magazine claimed, to get his official partner 
to sign a joint announcement of their separation on Saturday.

With a crucial conference before the world's press scheduled for Tuesday he thought this would be the 'least worst solution'.

But by Sunday night, Mr Hollande abandoned the plan, because he feared it would make him look cruel and insensitive.

Now
 it is reported that Miss Trierweiler has 'not the slightest intention of packing her bags',
 with the magazine stating: 'OK to forgive, but not OK to leave.'

If 
follows equally damaging claims that Miss Gayet boasted about her affair
 with an 'older man in politics' just a few months after he came to 
power.

Despite
 Mr Hollande's insistence that the scandal is a 'private matter' which 
should be kept 'secret', Miss Gayet is the cover girl in the latest 
edition of French Elle.

In 
it she is quoted as telling a friend 'more than a year ago' that she has
 found an 'older man, very different from earlier boyfriends, who is in 
politics.'

This appears to confirm the claims that she and Mr Hollande were in the midst of their affair 
within a few months of him being sworn in as French president in May 
2012.

It was around this 
time that Miss Trierweiler, a journalist for Paris Match magazine, began
 to restyle herself as France's first lady.

This
 entitled her to five permanent staff, and numerous other perks, 
including limousines, private jets and homes all over France.

Options: Mr Hollande at a press conference where he said that he would make his mind up about who his first lady was by February 11, when he is due to be in Washington for a meeting with President Barack Obama

Even before making any official public comment, Miss Trierweiler made her 
own views perfectly clear in the latest edition of Paris Match, which 
runs a glowing profile of her.

'There
 is no worse poison than indifference,' is a phrase widely being 
attribute to her - suggesting that Mr Hollande has been distracted from 
his relationship with her for a long time.

Mr
 Hollande told a Paris press conference on Tuesday that he would make 
his mind up about who his first lady was by February 11th.

This is the date that he is due to be in Washington for a meeting with President Barack Obama, and first lady Michelle Obama.

In
 words which may be considered extremely cruel by both women, Mr 
Hollande confirmed that the presidential partner had 'no official 
status' in France, and he was determined to keep costs down - whoever 
was confirmed as first lady.

Mr
 Hollande is a lifelong bachelor, but has four children with former 
presidential candidate Segolene Royal - a fellow Socialist.

He and Miss Trierweiler have lived together since 2007.
