Southampton climbed to third in the Premier League on Sunday night after beating Manchester United at Old Trafford as Ronald Koeman's side continues to defy the odds in their chase for Champions League football.

The Dutchman has rightly taken the plaudits for exceeding all expectations after the club made wholesale in the summer.

But who makes up Koeman's backroom staff? Here, Sportsmail gives you the low-down on the men working miracles behind the scenes at St Mary's.

ERWIN KOEMAN

Role: Assistant manager

Erwin Koeman is the older brother of manager Ronald and the pair teamed up in the summer to take charge of Southampton after managing against each other in the Dutch league.

Erwin managed RKC Waalwijk for two seasons - where he locked horns with Ronald, who was manager of Feyenoord - before joining his brother at St Mary's after leading the club to relegation last season.

It is the first time the brothers have coached together and Erwin said his late father Martin, who died in 2013, would have been pleased: 'We once said we would be good to work together, but my father also said it would be fantastic if we could be a duo. Unfortunately he won't experience it but I am sure he would really like it.'

Erwin, like Ronald, began his playing career at Groningen - the brothers spent one season together at the Dutch side in 1982-83 - before representing PSV and KV Mechelen in Belgium.

Erwin also lined up alongside his brother for Holland. The Southampton assistant earned 31 caps for the national side and was part of the team that won the 1988 European Championships.

JAN KLUITENBERG 

Role: First team coach

Jan Kluitenberg followed Koeman to Southampton in the summer after working under him at Feyenoord. The duo also enjoyed spells together at AZ Alkmaar and Benfica.

Kluitenberg's role at Southampton is to  ensure the players reach peak physical fitness and is responsible for devising individual training programmes to ensure maximum physical output and prevention of injuries.

Having worked with him at three previous clubs, Koeman clearly has trust in Kluitenberg's methods and after Sunday's 1-0 win at Old Trafford, where Saints produced a perfectly executed high pressing performance, it would be hard to argue with his techniques.

Jan Kluitenberg has worked with Koeman at three other clubs including Feynoord and AZ Alkmaar

SAMMY LEE

Role: First team assistant coach

Sammy Lee spent 12 years as a Liverpool player in the 1970s and 80s winning three consecutive league titles and three European Cups during a golden era for the club.

Lee began his coaching career at the Merseyside club, too, where he spent another 11 years at Liverpool working under Roy Evans and Gerard Houllier before moving on after the appointment of Rafa Benitez.

Lee then moved to Bolton and became Sam Allardyce's assistant - where he was affectionately known as 'Little Sam' - and even enjoyed a short spell in charge of the north-west club.

The 58-year-old also coached England for five years during Sven-Goran Eriksson's reign between 2001 and 2006, before further spells at Liverpool and Bolton.

Lee left his role as head of academy coaching at Wanderers to link up with Koeman at Southampton, with the club hoping to tap into more than 20 years of coaching experience.

MARTIN HUNTER 

Role: Technical director: 

Martin Hunter began his career as a PE and Geography teacher at Bridgewater Hall School in Milton Keynes, before working as assistant manager at Bradford and Stoke.

Hunter then spent 13 years as a coach at the FA, where he worked with England Under 15s, Under 16s and Under 19s and helped bring through the likes of Joe Cole, Theo Walcott and Michael Carrick into the senior team.

Hunter went on to work at Norwich and Watford - where he played an active role alongside Malky Mackay - before returning to Bradford for a short spell in 2010.

He then moved to Southampton in July 2010 as under 21 coach before moving into his role as technical director, where he has played a key role in bringing through players from the youth academy.

In a recent interview with the Telegraph Hunter described the 'Southampton way': 'We tell the coaches we want three things in the session: we want players coming off sweating with a smile on their faces and to have learned something.'

DAVE WATSON

Role: Senior goalkeeping coach

Dave Watson made more than 200 appearances for his hometown club Barnsley before his playing career was curtailed by a serious knee injury that he wasn't able to recover from.

Watson hung up his gloves in 2001 at just 28 before embarking on a coaching career that began at Northampton and took him to Oldham and Huddersfield.

Watson then worked with the England Under 19s, where he enhanced his reputation after assisting in the development of Joe Hart, Ben Foster and Jack Butland at international level.

His work didn't go unnoticed ans Watson was invited by senior manager Roy Hodgson to work alongside Ray Clemence at Euro 2012, before taking up a role at Norwich.

Leaving Norwich after their  relegation to the Championship last season, Watson joined the staff at Southampton and has helped Fraser Forster make the seamless transition to Premier League football.

PS LES REED

Role: Executive director

Les Reed began his career as a coach in non-League before spending time coaching in the FA becoming director of technical development, overseeing the development of Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard.

But Reed is most famous for a disastrous spell in charge of Charlton Athletic after taking over from Iain Dowie in November, 2006.

Reed lasted in the job just six weeks, managing one victory and suffered the embarrassment of being knocked out of the League Cup by League Two side Wycombe.

The ill-fated reign led to Reed being attacked in the media and he developed the unwanted nickname 'Les Miserables'. He left by mutual consent in December. 

Reed joined Southampton in 2010 as head of football development and was in charge of overseeing the youth academy, scouting and recruitment, sports medicine and science, and kit and equipment management.
