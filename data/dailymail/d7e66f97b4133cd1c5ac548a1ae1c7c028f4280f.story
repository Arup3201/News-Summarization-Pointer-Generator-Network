A crew of New York City strippers scammed wealthy men out of at least $200,000 by spiking their drinks and then dragging them to strip clubs to rack up enormous charges on their credit cards, authorities said on Wednesday.

A banker, a lawyer. a doctor and a real estate attorney were among the four unidentified victims plied with ecstasy, cocaine and prescription drugs and then taken to Scores in Manhattan and the RoadhHouse NYC Gentleman’s Club in Queens.

Once there the women would whisk the intoxicated men away for private dances and then take away their credit cards while they were too wasted to stop it.

Drug Enforcement Administration and New York Police Department investigators arrested four women, Samantha Barbash, Roselyn Keo, Karina Pacsucci and Marsi Rosen earlier this week on charges including grand larceny, assault and forgery.

Charged: Karina Pascucci arrives in court on Tuesday night after being charged in connection with a scam involving exotic dancers in New York City

Carmine Vitolo, a manager at the Roadhouse was also charged with conspiracy, grand larceny and tampering with physical evidence.

One of the women was expected to appear in state court in Manhattan on Wednesday following appearances on Tuesday by the other three women.

According to court papers, the strippers would prowl bars in Manhattan and Long Island for their victims over a four month period beginning in September 2013.

The roundup followed an undercover investigation that found that the women joined in a scheme to rip off the men by drugging them with Molly, a powerful powder form of ecstasy after arranging to meet them on 'dates'.

According to court papers, Samantha Barbash was the ring-leader along with Roselyn Keo.

Barbash’s attorney, Stephen Murphy, said Wednesday that his client denies the charges.

Drug allegations: Samantha Barbash led the extortion ring and threatened to blackmail some of her clients with photographs of them in compromising sexual positions from the night before

Once they had given their victims the drugs the women then took the men to the clubs and brought the inebriated men to private rooms for dances and then stole their cards and racked up huge charges.

The strippers falsely authorized tens of thousands of dollars to the victims' cards by forging their signatures and making them believe they were being charged for a lower amount.

'These individuals targeted and isolated victims in order to illegally obtain access to their credit cards and thousands of dollars of credit,' said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.

'Thanks to the hard work of the investigators and prosecutors in this case, these individuals will no longer be in a position to profit from this type of fraudulent activity.'

The clubs paid the women for the visits, but the establishments were not facing criminal charges, authorities said according to The New York Post.

The men reported waking up in their cars or in hotel rooms with little or no memory of the encounters.

Those who tried to dispute the strip club bills received texts from the strippers threatening to go public with their transgressions, authorities said.

'The defendants were banking on the victims being too afraid to contact the police,' said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan to The New York Daily News. 'They made a serious miscalculation.'

Also charged: Marsi Rosen is also charged with being part of a crime ring of strippers who have allegedly stolen at least $200,000 from wealthy New York City men

Club: Karina Pascucci has been charged with assault and theft along with her three other stripper accomplices revealed court documents from Manhattan on Tuesday

Exotic: This is the RoadHouse Gentlemen's Club in Queens - another favorite destination of the strippers

Indeed, in some cases the strippers took photos and videoed the men in compromising sexual positions with women and men and threatened to blackmail them.

Dr. Zyad Younan is allegedly one of the four men scammed out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by a gang of New York strippers

Last month, Scores sued a cardiologist, saying he owed the club $135,303 for unpaid services.

According to the lawsuit, the doctor disputed the charges by saying 'he was drugged by plaintiff's employees and thus did not authorize the charges'— a claim the club says is contradicted by security video showing him freely showing up there on four separate occasions.

A source identified this man as Zyad Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

According to The New York Daily News, Younan, denied he willingly authorized the $135,303 of charges.

'Today’s
 indictment exposes a pattern of fraud that contributed to erroneous 
media reports,' said Michael Weinstein, attorney of one of the alleged 
victims.

'We were always confident that law enforcement’s 
efforts would expose that my client was preyed upon by this ring and not
 responsible for charges to his credit card.'

The three other unidentified victims were all allegedly conned for a total of $55,000.

Special
 Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan said the scam 'involved not only 
the theft of $200,000, but compromised the health, safety and security 
of victims by covertly giving them harmful substances.'

There was no immediate response to phone messages left Wednesday at Scores and the RoadHouse.
