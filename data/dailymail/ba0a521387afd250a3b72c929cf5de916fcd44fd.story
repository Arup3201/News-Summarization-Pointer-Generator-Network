Taoreed Ogboye has been jailed for five years after returning to a life of burglary

Having admitted to 178 burglaries, and with a previous spell in jail for the same offence to his name, Taoreed Ogboye must have been expecting another stint in prison.

Instead, the judge gave him another chance and ordered him to take part in a rehabilitation course.

Ogboye, 24, began in a positive fashion by starring in a crime prevention video for police, in which he advised families to keep lights on, install alarms and CCTV and keep valuables in safes.

But barely a month later he was ransacking people’s homes again.

He has now been jailed for five years for the crime spree, which netted around £400,000 of valuables – none of which has been recovered.

And the Mail can reveal the initial reprieve was granted despite Ogboye previously receiving a 42-month jail term for burglary, the proceeds of which paid for an Audi TT and an apartment in a luxury development where he rubbed shoulders with pop stars, actors and Premier League footballers.

One of his victims, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He wasn’t a drug addict who arguably couldn’t help himself – he was just plain greedy. Why did they give him the chance to offend again?’

Ogboye’s life of crime began when he was 16. By 2007, he was ransacking homes throughout Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and London. He targeted Asian families, believing they would be more likely to have valuable gold and jewellery.

Last September, he entered a house in 
Luton and took £30,000 of valuables. On December 16 a neighbour alerted 
police to a raid on a Watford address and Ogboye was found hiding in a 
wheelie bin.

At court on April 23, he admitted to three offences and asked for 175 more to be taken into consideration.

Judge Andrew Bright, QC, deferred 
sentence and put him on the ‘Choices and Consequences’ rehabilitation 
programme, under which he had to wear an electronic tag and obey a 9pm 
to 6am curfew.

opportunity to change his life when he jailed him yesterday at Luton Crown 
Court

But as soon as May 28, London-born 
Ogboye was back to his old ways, when he and another man broke into a 
house in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. More jewellery was taken from a house 
in Barnet on June 5.

Ogboye, of Hatfield, was arrested after his electronic tag showed he had been in both areas at the time.

Appearing at Luton Crown Court 
yesterday, he admitted attempted burglary and burglary. He was also 
dealt with for the offences he admitted earlier this year.

Prosecutor 
Neil King described the defendant as a ‘burglar of considerable 
professionalism’ whom other criminals paid to act as a ‘burglary 
consultant’ by identifying the best properties to target.

Veronica Reeve, defending, claimed her
 client broke into homes to prove he wasn’t in league with police after 
other criminals saw the anti-crime video and assumed he was informing on
 them.

Jailing Ogboye yesterday, Judge Bright
 said he had ‘seemed to be trying’ to leave his life of crime behind but
 added: ‘Your commitment was shortlived.’

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman 
yesterday defended the rehabilitation programme, saying: ‘Ogboye was 
addicted to a lavish lifestyle, which is quite difficult to get away 
from. He liked living the high life.

‘He couldn’t be helped but admitted 170-odd offences which might never have been solved otherwise.’
