Moving home is usually a stressful experience, but Inuka the polar bear looks like he is having no problem chilling out in his new £5million arctic enclosure.

The 22-year-old, who was the first bear of his species to be born in the tropics, has been moved into a specially-built, climate-controlled home at Singapore Zoo named Frozen Tundra.

The 2,700 square metre exhibit features a huge pool with giant ice blocks for him to rest on while swimming, a waterfall and an ice cave for him to sleep in at night.

Singapore Zoo say the enclosure, which is four times bigger than the previous one, has been modelled as closely as possible on the polar bear's natural habitat.

The organisation has been planning a new home for Inuka since 2006 and has spent millions on the upgrade.

Natural substrates have been incorporated to provide him with a rich and varied home. 

It also has two new sections for Inuka's new neighbours - raccoon dogs and wolverines.

'At Singapore Zoo, we remain 
committed to not only providing a fun and beautiful park where families 
can bond over the wonders of mother nature, but also to our vision of 
engaging and educating our visitors about the natural world, the animals
that share our planet and their habitats. This is a core value of 
Singapore Zoo,' said Mr Lee Meng Tat, CEO, at Wildlife Reserves 
Singapore.

'Those values and goals go hand in 
hand with our deep love of our animal friends here at Singapore Zoo, and
Inuka is a shining example of that love.'
