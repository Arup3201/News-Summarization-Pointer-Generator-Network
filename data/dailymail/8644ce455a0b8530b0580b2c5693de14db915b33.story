Former CIA director James Woolsey said Thursday that President Obama 'looks scared' to called members of Middle Eastern terrorist groups 'Islamic,' just hours after the conclusion of a White House 'Countering VIolent Extremism' summit that studiously avoided pinning terrorism on Islamists.

Sitting FBI director James Comey was not invited to the event, but his counterpart from Russia – Aleksandr Bortnikov, the director of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) – attended.

The FSB is the post-Soviet successor to the infamous KGB. 

Woolsey told a CNN audience that Obama 'looks scared. He looks as if he's afraid of using the adjective "Islamic" to describe the terrorists' from ISIS, al-Qaeda and other international terror groups bent on mass-murder and global destruction.

The White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism at the State Department was a three-day event that put diplomats in the same room as 'community organizers' but never denounced ISIS as an Islamic group

The president, he said, is the 'world champion of political correctness, and I think that he's let it really run too far here.'

The White House pushed back on Friday.

Press secretary Josh Earnest said: 'I don't think that the countless terrorists that have been wiped off the battlefield as a result of military action that this president has ordered feel that the president is particularly fearful.'

Obama said Thursday during the conference that ISIS and other terror groups 'are desperate for legitimacy, and all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that (they) somehow represent Islam.'

'That is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative,' the president insisted, saying later that 'the notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie.' 

But hours later Woolsey alleged that Obama is not 'taking a stern position in the Middle East and elsewhere, that are causing huge problems.'

'You have to fight effectively – and he's not doing that,' he claimed.

And meanwhile, 'ISIS is doing what it is doing, murdering people, burning them alive and trying to expand into a caliphate that covers – has a state – covering the Middle Wast and beyond, in the way it happened in Muhammad's time.'

The White House pushed back Thursday against the idea that FBI Director Comey should have been present for the conference's discussions.

'While the FBI works tirelessly to keep the country safe, this conference was not centered on federal law enforcement.,' an Obama administration official told The New York Times.

'The notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie,' Obama insisted

Woolsey said Obama is the 'world champion of political correctness' and seems 'afraid' to engage ISIS in terms of Islam 

The conference, the official said, was premised on the idea that 'community leaders, local law enforcement, private sector innovators, and others' could embrace a 'bottom-up approach' at countering terrorism in American communities.

Comey's boss, Attorney General Eric Holder, was present during portions of the event.

Officials told the Times that Bortnikov, the Russian spymaster, was sent by the Vladimir Putin regime after the State Department extended an invitation for Russia to send an emissary of its own choosing.

'Bortnikov will inform the participants of the forum about the national system to counter extremism that is functioning in the Russian Federation, stressing the importance of the role of the state in countering the ideology of terrorism,' the FSB said in a statemet earlier in the week.
