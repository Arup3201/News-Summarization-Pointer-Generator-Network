A Boy Scout leader of a New York-based troop is recovering after being savagely attacked by a rabid beaver at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pennsylvania.

Normand Brousseau, 51, of Pine Plains, New York, was swimming in the river with a floating device known as a 'noodle' when the beaver latched onto his chest.

After being bitten and clawed at several times, Mr Brousseau was finally pulled to shore by Nick Hedges, 16, who joined his three fellow Scouts in pelting the deranged creature with stones until it died.

Brave: Troop 32 from Elizaville, New York was on a field trip to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pennsylvania when Nick Hedges, 16, (third from left) was forced to pull his leader to safety

Mr Brousseau has received over 20 rabies shots and is said to be recovering well since being treated at Pocono Medical Center in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.

The assistant scoutmaster had been co-leading a field trip in the Dutchess County park when he felt the animal between his legs in the water.

Savage: A Boy Scout leader was set upon by a rabid beaver in the Delaware Gap and was bitten and clawed until members of his troop hauled him to shore and killed the animal

Recalling the moment the beaver attached itself to his chest, he told the Poughkeepsie Journal: 'I thought it was a giant carp fish.'

But any such thoughts of over-sized goldfish were soon dispelled as the beaver took a bite at him.

Hero: Nick Hedges and his fellow boy scouts threw stones at the beaver until they had killed it

Grabbing hold of his aggressor and 
attempting to cast it away from his body proved only a temporary 
solution as the rabid creature came back for more, biting at his leg, 
buttocks, arm, hand and waist.

By then, Mr Brousseau explained, 'the adrenaline kicked in.'

'I
grabbed it in its mouth,' he said. 'I had it around its bottom jaw as 
tightly as I could because I knew it was going to either bite me or bite
the boys. I called the Scouts to come give me a hand.'

Mr Hedges of Elizaville, New York, was the first on hand to help the victim and while keeping a careful eye on the beaver, pulled his leader to shore. 

Safely on dry land, Mr Brousseau hurled the beaver up onto shore where it turned its attention to the noodle and began ripping it apart.

'We started throwing rocks at it,' Mr Hedges recalled. 'We could see it was still dangerous.'

While
the young men wrestled with the beaver, passing canoeists offered to 
take Mr Brousseau to the other side of the river and to get help and 
another park visitor witnessing the scene called 911.

Mr
Brousseau has dismissed the praise bestowed upon him from parents of 
Troop 32's members saying he did what he had to do to keep the boys 
safe.

Nevertheless, 
Susan Treacy of Stanfordville, whose 15-year-old son, Zach Pruner was 
also on the trip, said: 'It was very brave of him. Who’d be crazy enough
to hang onto a rabid beaver?'

Dutchess
County health officials meanwhile claim that an attack from a rabid 
beaver is unusual and locals to the area struggle to recall the last 
time something like this happened.

A river runs through it: Health officials in Dutchess County say such a vicious attack from a rabid animal is very rare though visitors to the park should always be aware of signs of rabies like unusual and aggressive behaviour

The attach, however, follows a similar incident in Virginia's 
Spotsylvania County in July where eight-year-old Annabella Radnovich 
and her 11-year-old sister, Alyssa, were playing with their cousins at 
Lake Anna when a 65 pound beaver bit and scratched their legs.

Stephen Capowski, director of environmental health services for Dutchess County urged people to look out for signs of unusual behaviour among animals that can point to rabies such as sightings of nocturnal animals in daylight hours or aggressive behaviour between domesticated pets.

Mr Brousseau confessed: 'I’m pretty sore' but said he has learned a valuable lesson from the incident.

'When you go out into nature, you always need to veer on the side of caution,' he said. 'Don’t assume a wild animal is not sick. You have to be on your toes at all times.'
