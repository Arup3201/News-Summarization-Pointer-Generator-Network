Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, will personally assess all aid spending of more than £1m. The ministry has faced criticism about deals with contractors

Justine Greening is to examine every aid contract worth more than £1million in a bid to tackle her ministry’s reputation for waste.

She said she was determined to improve financial controls ahead of another massive budget increase at the Department for International Development.

Her intervention will mean a major tightening of the rules – her predecessor Andrew Mitchell took personal control only when contracts cost more than £40million. Deals worth less were handled by junior ministers or even officials.

Miss Greening is also summoning the department’s major contractors for talks on cutting costs.

DfID has faced criticism over its reliance on private sector consultants – dubbed poverty barons  – who were paid almost £500million last year.

'Suppliers must show they’re not just in it for the money,’ said a Whitehall source.

'In the next few weeks Justine will get all our top suppliers in for face-to-face meetings to explain that the department will be looking for better value for money in new contracts.

'If they can’t deliver better value, we’ll use suppliers who do.'

Miss Greening is also insisting on personally signing off IT and buildings deals worth more than £500,000.

She was appointed International Development Secretary last month at a time of renewed criticism of the Government’s plans to pour billions more into foreign aid in the coming years.

A string of peers on all sides used a Lords debate yesterday to urge ministers to drop the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid.

Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson said it was bizarre that the aid budget was 'roaring ahead' when other spending programmes were being cut back.

He said it was 'pathetic' that the Government’s main argument for imposing the target was that all three parties had pledged to at the last election.

'In my rather long political experience when all three political parties are agreed on a policy it is nearly always mistaken – as it is in this case,' he added.

Labour peer Lord Hollick said the extra £4billion to be spent on aid spending could be spent on a 2p cut in income tax to help the economy

Another Tory ex-minister, Lord MacGregor, said it was wrong to judge a department 'by whether it pushes money out of the door rather than whether it is properly spent'.

He called for an end to the £285million-a-year aid programme to India, saying it risked creating a ‘perverse incentive to the Indian government to use less of their own resources to relieve poverty’.

Aid spending is due to increase from £8billion a year to £12billion in order to hit the Government’s 0.7 per cent target.

Labour peer Lord Hollick said the extra money should be used instead to fund a 2p cut in income tax to 'reduce the burden of recession on the hard-working squeezed middle and stimulate growth'.

Lord Boateng said although he supported the idea of increasing aid he had concerns about DfID’s capacity to spend the money effectively.

The former Labour cabinet minister said the department 'had more money at its disposal than it could deal with'.

Responding for the Government, Baroness Northover rejected the call for ministers to drop the commitment on aid spending, insisting it was both in the interests of Britain and recipient countries.

Lady Northover denied achieving the pledge would prioritise the amount of aid over results achieved.
