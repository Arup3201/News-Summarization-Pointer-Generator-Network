It might only take a minute, two at most. But that wait for the water to boil when you're desperate for your morning tea can seem like an eternity.

But now a revolutionary new kettle that hooks up to your wifi could put an end to the agony - and shave minutes off your daily routine.

The iKettle can be switched on remotely over the internet using a smartphone, meaning you can get your tea on the go from anywhere in your house - and yes, that includes bed.

Futuristic: The iKettle can be switched on remotely using a smartphone app - and will even wake you up to ask you if you would like it switched on

There will be no more dashing out during X Factor ad breaks and hopping from foot to foot while the thing slowly boils either.

The
 kettle can be switched on from your phone before the ad breaks happen -
 and then set to be kept warm until you're ready to use the water.

The
 1.8 litre kettle, dubbed the 'steaming servant' on Firebox.com where it 
went on sale this morning, has some decent new technology in there too. Thanks to our growing fondness for hippy teas, the kettle has been created with a selection of different temperatures, designed to suit specific drinks.

Control: The kettle can be set to boil at a variety of different temperatures depending on the drink required. Green tea is best at 80f, coffee at 95f

According to hot beverage boffins, different drinks are best served at specific temperatures - green
 tea at 80 degrees; coffee at 95, for example - and you can pre-set the 
kettle to heat the water to the appropriate level. So far so fabulous.

But the
 question that leaps to mind is whether this futuristic contraption 
could potentially be switched on from afar without the user realising it
 is empty.

The answer to that, say iKettle's manufacturers, is no. They say that the kettle has an auto-shut off 
function and boil-dry protection, and won't heat up unless there's 
enough water for it to do so safely.

Now if only it could make the tea and bring it up to us too, our lives really would be complete.

Design features: The kettle has a soft-touch handle and transparent lid so you can see how much water is in the jug

Hi-tech: The app will wake you up with a morning message or welcome you home with a missive asking if you'd like the kettle boiled
