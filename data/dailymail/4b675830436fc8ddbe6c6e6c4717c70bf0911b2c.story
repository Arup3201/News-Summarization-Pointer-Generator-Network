A girl of 11 was thrown off a school trip for eating a 20p chocolate bar in her hotel room.

Her mother had to make a 160-mile round trip to the Isle of Wight in the middle of the night to collect her.

Teachers only discovered that Holli McCann had broken the chocolate ban because they opened and read a letter home in which she described how she and two friends had shared the bars on the first night of the week-long end-of-year trip.

Punished: Holli McCann, 11, was sent home from a school holiday in the Isle of Wight for eating chocolate in the hotel

They immediately searched her room, 
removing the lining of her suitcase and tipping out her toilet bag in 
the hunt for more chocolate.

No excuses: Holli's headteacher insisted she had broken the school's behavioural charter and had to go home

The other two girls involved escaped 
with a warning but Holli’s mother Kerri received an urgent message 
telling her to contact the school’s hotel in Sandown.

Yvonne Graves, head of Bromet 
Primary School in Watford, ordered her to collect her daughter 
immediately.

She said Holli had also misbehaved the previous day.

Miss McCann urged the head to 
reconsider but was told that even if Holli stayed, she would not be 
allowed to join in any activities.

She drove through the night from her 
home in Croxley Green, near Watford, to make the 160-mile round trip – 
which involved two ferry crossings.

Miss McCann, 47, a full-time carer 
for her autistic son, had saved for six months to pay for the £300 
holiday and had to borrow £130 from family and friends to pay her own 
travel costs.

‘Holli had been so excited about the 
trip. They had been planning the feast weeks before.

'It’s not like they 
were having a party or making noise,’ she said.

‘I am furious that they read her 
letter to me. You would have thought they were running an international 
drug-smuggling operation.’

Upset: Kerri McCann said she arrived to find Holli waiting outside the Beaufort House hotel with a packed suitcase and in tears

Anger: The headteacher of Bromet primary school in Watford sent Holli McCann home in disgrace because she was caught eating chocolate at the hotel

Miss McCann withdrew Holli from the school for the rest of her final term.

She wrote to Mrs Graves saying: ‘What
Holli did was wrong but your own behaviour and handling of the 
situation was disgraceful.’ She has also written to Education Secretary 
Michael Gove.

Hertfordshire county council said: 
‘Parents and pupils were asked to sign a behaviour charter. It was made 
clear that breaking [it] would result in parents being asked to take 
their child home.’

Ian Savage, owner of Beaufort House 
where the pupils stayed, said: ‘We ask school parties to keep fizzy 
drinks, sweets and chocolate in the downstairs areas and only allow 
bottled water in bedrooms.

If we get a bad review because there are sticky marks in the rooms, we lose business.’
