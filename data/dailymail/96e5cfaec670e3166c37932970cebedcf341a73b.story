As Deputy Prime Minister, he is used to facing rowdy backbenchers in  the Commons.

But Nick Clegg may not have been expecting this scathing verdict on his speech – from a rather bored looking schoolboy.

The pupil made what appeared to be an obscene gesture with his middle finger yesterday as he sat through Mr Clegg’s talk at his school. At other points in the speech, the ginger-haired boy seemed to have virtually nodded off. He was pictured with his eyes closed, resting his head in his hands.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was setting out his plans for helping school leavers but the audience seemed unimpressed

This pupil at Southfields Academy in South West London appeared to be sending a not-so-subtle message to the Deputy PM

Dressed
 in a navy blazer and striped tie, he appeared to try to hide his 
middle-finger gesture by holding his hand against his face.

It did 
not impress the girl sat next to him, however, who was seen giving him a
 dismissive look. Mr Clegg apparently did not notice.

The Lib Dem leader was making a speech to around 500 young people at Southfields Academy in South London.

He announced that youngsters will be able to gain help at jobcentres from the age of 16, but that jobless teenagers will be forced to improve their maths and English skills or lose their benefits

The
 Deputy Prime Minister said 18-21-year-olds who left school without a 
grade C at GCSE will be put on compulsory training courses as soon as 
they sign on to the dole.

The
 crackdown is part of a package of measures aimed at preparing young 
people for the world of work, including better careers advice, more work
 experience and Jobcentres helping under-18s for the first time.

One in seven young people in the UK are not in school, work, or training, according to new figures released today.

Schools will be made to offer better careers advice while Jobcentres will be able to help 16 and 17-year-olds, Mr Clegg said

The Deputy Prime Minister's speech struggled to inspire many students, but he ploughed on

In
 total, 844,000 16 to 24-year-olds are considered 'Neet' - not in 
education, employment or training - although the numbers are falling, 
government data shows.

The Business Department said that the proportion of Neets in this age group is the lowest it has been since 2008.

Almost four in 10 16-24 year-olds do not have good qualifications in maths and English.

Under new plans to prepare school leavers for work, 18-21 year olds signing on at Jobcentres will have to prove their skills.

If they do not who do not have at least a C grade in English and Maths will be put on training courses immediately.

Those
 who refuse will lose their benefits. The scheme will be piloted in 
Kent, Mercia, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall from this autumn, using both 
face-to-face training and online support.

Mr
 Clegg said: ‘From day one of signing up for unemployment benefit, these
 young people will need to show they have those Maths and English 
qualifications that every job demands.

‘If
 they don’t, their adviser will get them on that training immediately to
 ensure that if you’re not earning, you’re still learning.

‘We’re
 looking at using the latest online learning technologies, so you can 
fit this training around the other responsibilities in your life.

‘If you don’t do this training, you won’t get your Jobseekers Allowance.’

If
 the young people then get a job, the training will continue to ensure 
they have the kills to progress in the workplace, Mr Clegg added.

‘If
 these pilots are successful, I want to see them rolled out across the 
country: putting earn or learn at the heart of the support we give you.’

For the first time Jobcentres will also be told to help 16 and 17-year-olds looking for work.

Mr Clegg said rules banning advisers from working with under-18s ‘just seems wrong’.

‘Surely we should be getting in there early and supplying you with the support you need right now to get into training or work.

‘Government
 will now be testing a new approach in selected Jobcentres across 
Britain. This, for the first time, will give 16 and 17 year olds access 
to personalised jobs advice and support through Jobcentre Plus.

‘You’ll,
 finally, have someone there you can talk to about your options and who 
can give you information about different schemes like Apprenticeships 
and Traineeships and help you apply for jobs or training places.’ Around
 3,000 16 and 17-year-olds will take part in pilots.

For the first time Jobcentres will be able to help 16 and 17-year-olds looking for work, while schools will be told to improve careers advice to pupils (file picture)

Schools will also face tougher requirements to provide decent careers guidance to pupils.

Careers advice for many teenagers is a ‘tick box exercise squeezed into a lunchtime break’, Mr Clegg says.

In a speech to around 500 young people at Southfields Academy, south London, Mr Clegg is unveiling measures which he says will help stop young people becoming 'NEET' (not in education, employment or training).

He cites a recent Ofsted study which found that just one in five schools were giving all of their pupils detailed career support.

Mr Clegg said: ‘For a lot of the young people I meet, careers guidance currently feels like a tick box exercise squeezed into lunchtime break with a busy teacher, who no doubt already has a lot on their plate.

‘So, we are issuing new guidance for schools, in the next few weeks, that will set out just what good careers advice should look like.

'And not take-it-or-leave-it guidance. To make sure it's being followed, Ofsted will be looking more closely at the quality of careers advice and support available when they inspect schools.’

In
 2010, Mr Clegg angered students when he abandoned his general election 
pledge to vote against any increase in university tuition fees.
