They have set the standard for superhero games to follow and now the latest addition to Rocksteady Studio's Arkham saga has been announced.

Set before 2009's Arkham Asylum, Batman: Arkham Origins follows a younger Batman who has been targeted by assassins on Christmas Eve.

Look who's back: Batman is coming to current-gen consoles on October 25

Plot explores Bruce Wayne's rocky relationship with Alfred Pennyworth, who has been a father figure since his parents death. It also introduces new villains such as Deathstroke, Black Mask, Anarky and Alberto Falcone. The Joker, Penguin, Bane and Deadshot are set to return.

Not returning is long-standing Batman voice actor, Kevin Conroy. Roger Craig Smith, who voiced Assassin's Creed's Ezio Auditore has taken over the role.

Gameplay is very similar to the other games, centering around gadget-based hand-to-hand combat. Old favourites including the Crytographic scanner, explosive gel and various Batarangs feature as well as new gadgets.

The Remote Claw, for example, allows Batman to pull enemies and objects towards him or create a tightrope for him to traverse.

Combat is now tracked and experience points are awarded for strong combination attacks. Upgrades to abilities and gadgets are unlocked depending on your XP. Whereas most enemies in the last game could be taken down easily, Origins introduces a new enemy type that can counter Batman's moves.

Batman can also call in the Batwing to fast travel to different locations. Some areas are patrolled by tower installations that have to be disabled before Batman can summon the Batwing there.

There are also plenty of side missions including 'Crime in Progress', where Batman can assist Gotham City Police in tackling crime and improve his reputation. 'Most Wanted' missions see the Dark Knight hunting specific villains, such as Anarky, throughout the city.

Crimes can be reviewed on the Batcomputer and at the Batcave and can be viewed from various angles and speeds to ensure that no clues are missed.

It's powered by Unreal 3, the same engine behind its predecessors. There is no word yet on whether Origins will be next-gen compatible.

A Vita and 3DS spin-off called Batman: Arkham Origins: Blackgate is also penned for release and is being developed in parallel. It uses a different engine - a modified version of Blueprint.

Batman: Arkham Origins set for release on October 25.
