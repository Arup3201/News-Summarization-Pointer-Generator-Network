Holding on to it: Figures from the Bank of England show the amount lent by banks to entrepreneurs has dropped every month since April 2010

Small businesses have been starved of cash by banks for four years – with net lending plunging by £4.3billion in the past year alone – the Bank of England said yesterday.

Its figures show the amount lent by banking giants to entrepreneurs has dropped every month since April 2010.

Between February 2013 and February this year, the total handed to small firms fell by 2.5 per cent – a drop in net lending of £4.3billion.

Net lending is the total amount given out by banks, minus the amount that is repaid.

The Bank’s latest ‘Trends in Lending’ report said entrepreneurs, who are the backbone of the economy, are increasingly turning their backs on the banks.

It said: ‘SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] use of alternative sources of finance to borrowing from banks is increasing. In 2013, contacts of the Bank’s network of agents [based around the UK] reported a growing use of non-bank finance by SMEs, albeit from low levels.’

Alternative sources include peer-to-peer lending, when people lend money directly to entrepreneurs and receive interest on the money, and venture capital funds, which are investors who put money into small businesses in return for a stake in the firm.

Yesterday the Federation of Small Businesses said it is ‘critical’ the problems faced by small firms getting the money that they need to grow is resolved as a matter of urgency.

John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘Demand for finance by small firms is outstripping supply. Coupled with no change in the pricing of lending facilities despite a strengthening economy, it underlines the ongoing challenges small businesses face in accessing finance to meet their growth ambitions.

‘As the economy continues to gain momentum, ensuring small firms have access to finance is critical.’

It is nearly four years since this newspaper launched its ‘Make the Banks Lend’ campaign in July 2010 to highlight the plight of small firms, which need money to grow.

At the time, the former Bank of England governor, Lord King, described being deeply saddened by the ‘heartbreaking’ stories that he regularly heard from entrepreneurs struggling to survive, or expand their business.

Marcus Grimshaw, chairman of the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers, said: ‘There is more work to be done to help credit-worthy businesses access finance.

‘Government initiatives are having an impact, but there are still too many SMEs in the UK whose growth is being obstructed because they can’t access the right funds.’

The Bank’s figures show gross lending to small firms was £12.5billion between October and December 2013, compared to £9.4billion between October and December 2012.

But critics say the problem will not be resolved until the all-important net lending figure becomes positive again.

Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the British Bankers’ Association, said: ‘As the economy picks up businesses are building up record cash reserves and paying off more of their debt, leading to an overall decline in net lending.

‘However, as the Bank of England notes, new lending is picking up strongly.

He insisted: ‘There has rarely been a better time to approach your bank.’
