Steven Gerrard admits he is delighted Roy Hodgson went with youth for his England World Cup squad because it means he can conserve his energy more.

Gerrard, speaking on ITV ahead of the Champions League final where Real Madrid beat Atletico 4-1, is happy the likes of Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling have been called up for Brazil, as he approaches his 34th birthday.

The Liverpool skipper was also greeted in the studio by former team-mate Xabi Alonso, who was suspended for the Champins League final for Real Madrid.

Celebration: But Steven Gerrard is ready to call time on his international career after this summer's World Cup

'The team and the squad is full of legs and energy which is good for me coming up to my 34th birthday,' he said.

'We've been together for four or five days, but it is good, hopefully it is going to build and get better the closer the games come about, but winning football matches builds spirit too.

The England skipper admits disappointments in previous campaigns make him hungry for success going into his sixth major tournament, and what will possible be his last.

'I think the frustrations of not delivering of not delivering as a team and on a personal front on a few of these occassions, it gives you that determination with your head held high to make the supporters happy, and give it one more final go.'

Gerrard, who turns 34 on May 30, says Roy Hodgson will be looking to play the team in his mind for the first World Cup game against Italy on June 14 in the upcoming friendlies Peru, Ecuador and Honduras.

'With three games to go before the big game he's going to be looking toward the team he's starting in his first game. I'm sure he'll try one or two tweaks though.'

Gerrard, when asked if he'd like to avoid Argentina in the World Cup with Angel Di Maria putting in such a fine performance, said the Real Madrid man is relentless.

'Of course you know Real Madrid are littered with top quality players, we talk of Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo, but Di Maria was relentless all game, kept attacking the full-back, for me he was man of the match,' he said.

'They got the substitutions bang on, bringing Marcelo on who was sensational.'
