Resigned: Rebekah Brooks, pictured here on Tuesday, sensationally strood down as News International chief executive this morning

Rebekah Brooks this morning sensationally resigned as chief executive of News International, it was revealed.

In an internal email to staff she announced she was standing down to avoid distracting attention from News International's efforts to 'fix the problems of the past'.

In a statement the 43-year-old said: 'I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt.

'I now need to concentrate on correcting the distortions and rebutting the allegations about my record as a journalist.'

Pressure was mounting on her to quit 
after the second biggest shareholder at News Corp said she 'must go'. 
Even Prime Minister David Cameron had said in recent days that he would 
accept Mrs Brooks' resignation.

Fractures had earlier begun to appear 
between senior figures at News International over the handling of the 
phone hacking scandal after Rupert Murdoch's daughter apparently 
launched a four-letter attack and the second biggest shareholder 
declared that 'she has to go.'

Elisabeth Murdoch is reported to have
told friends that Brooks had 'f***** the company' and Saudi Prince 
Al-waleed bin Talal has made his position clear that she should leave.

Until
today's resignation the Murdochs have said they are standing behind the
former News of the World editor but it appears that her job is becoming
more and more untenable as senior figures turning in the company on 
her.

Elisabeth Murdoch, 42, is understood to 
be furious that her father's media empire has been thrown into turmoil 
and from her apparent outburst, revealed in the Daily Telegraph, it appears she holds Brooks responsible for the handling of the crisis.

Turning tide: Prince bin Talal said Brooks 'must go' while Elisabeth Murdoch said she had 'f***** the company'

Rupert Murdoch, 80, has been keen to show that he is fully behind the NI chief executive last night playing the crisis down declaring that 'we only made minor mistakes' over the scandal.

The media tycoon and his son James last night agreed to appear at Parliament to go before MPs investigating phone hacking after facing the bizarre prospect of imprisonment in a cell half way up the Big Ben clock tower.

They prompted fury at Westminster 
after initially declining the invitation to give evidence at a powerful 
Commons select committee meeting next week.

As a near-hysterical mood gripped the
Commons, there were even suggestions that Parliament should somehow 
'impound' Mr Murdoch’s private jet to prevent him leaving the country.

Britain's top civil servant yesterday hit back at claims by Gordon Brown that officials prevented him ordering an inquiry into the phone-hacking scandal.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell published secret papers showing Mr Brown was offered advice on the pros and cons of an inquiry, but never told what to do.

Sir Gus was said to be 'incandescent' with anger after Mr Brown suggested in the Commons that the civil service thwarted his plans to hold an inquiry into the scandal at the News of the World in the run-up to last year's general election.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also poured scorn on Mr Brown, accusing him of 'rewriting history'.

On Wednesday Mr Brown insisted his plan for an inquiry was 'opposed' by the civil service, the police, the Home Office and a committee of MPs which had already investigated the affair.

Sir Gus's advice reveals he said there was a risk any bid to hold an inquiry would be successfully challenged in court unless ministers could show there was 'public concern' and warned targeting the NoTW 'could be deemed to be politically motivated'.

But a final decision on an inquiry was left to Mr Brown.

Only last week he was pictured smiling 
with his arm around Brooks after an hour-long meeting at his luxury 
London flat and when asked what his top priority was, he gestured at Brooks 
and said: 'This one'.

Prince bin Talal, who holds seven per
cent shares in News Corp, told BBC's Newsnight that Brooks should quit.
'For sure she has to go,' he said 'you bet she has to go.'

Speaking on his luxury yacht, the billionaire  - known as the 'Arab Warren Buffet'- added: 'We hope that as this things unfolds the truth will come out.

'It's very important to me and my company who have been investors in 
News Corp for 20 years to get this in order because ethics to me are 
very important.'

He added: 'I will not accept to deal with a company that has a lady or a man that has any sliver of doubts on her or his integrity.'

Turning to the hacking of Milly 
Dowler's phone, he said he wanted to differentiate between the News of 
the World and the corporation as a whole.

Remarking on allegations that James 
Murdoch had known about illegal activity he said: 'I think we have to 
wait for the commission that's been appointed by the Prime Minister and 
look at the results.' He also urged the Murdochs to co-operate with the 
investigation.

However Asaud, who could lose 
hundreds of millions if News Corp's stock market value crashed further, 
put forward a measured defence of the company saying it should not be 
'over-criticised.'

Elisabeth
Murdoch is due to be given a seat on the board of News Corp next to her
brother, James, chairman of NI, a move that had made Brook's future look more uncertain.

His two 
offspring will one day inherit their ageing father's empire and the 
different approaches to Brooks raise the question of whether she will be
'frozen out' amid a growing tide of public anger.

United front: Rupert Murdoch has publicly backed the News International chief executive but other senior figures want are now turning on Ms Brooks

Commissioner of the Met Police Sir Paul Stephenson, left, did not inform the Prime Minister that Neil Wallis had been employed by Scotland Yard between October 2009 and September 2010

Ms
Murdoch was a managing director at BSkyB but left in 2000 to pursue her
own ventures until recently rejoining News Corp when it bought her 
production company, Shine, for £290m.

The controversial deal caused uproar among U.S. shareholders who accused her of using the business as a 'family candy store'.

Yesterday Neil Wallis, a former executive editor at News of the World, was arrested and later bailed over phone hacking allegations.

His alleged involvement in the crisis is a further embarrassment for Scotland Yard as it turned out the 60-year-old was paid £1,000-a-day as a consultant between October 2009 and September 2010.

As a result head of the Yard, Sir Paul Stephenson, also faces being dragged before MPs to explain himself and his relationship with Wallis.

A former New York police officer has also claimed that News of the World journalists tried to pay him for phone details of British 9/11 victims

Both Home Secretary Theresa May and an angry Mr Johnson have both demanded answer from the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.

Mr Stephenson briefed David Cameron at Downing Street earlier this week but sources at Number 10 said he had made no mention of the Wallis appointment whatsoever.

As a mark that Brooks's prediction last week that 'worse revelations are yet to come' forms some truth, the FBI has now waded in on the scandal saying it has launched its own investigation.

A source at the bureau said that they were looking into allegations that the phones of September 11 victims were also hacked by News Corporation employees.

News Corporation's bid to buy the remaining 60 per cent of BSkyB was shelved this week but the company's second biggest shareholder revealed the plan will 'come back'.
