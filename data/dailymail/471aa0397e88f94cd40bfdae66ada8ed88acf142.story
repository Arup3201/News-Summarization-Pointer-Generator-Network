A Pennsylvania pain management doctor is accused of getting a dozen of his female patients hooked on strong narcotics and then using their addictions to sexually assault them.

Jay J. Cho, 71, was arrested on Tuesday with charges including rape and aggravated indecent assault.

Cho, who had offices in both Cumberland and Franklin, is accused of drugging women for as long as five years.

Perverted desires: Jay J. Cho, 71, is accused of getting the women addicted to strong narcotics before threatening to stop filling their prescriptions unless they gave in to his sexual demands

The New York Daily News reports that Cho allegedly gave women large quantities of painkillers such as Oxycodone until they became addicted.

He is accused of baiting women for sexual favors with refill prescriptions.

'The vast majority of the patients were afraid that he would not see them as patients anymore if they rejected his sexual advances,' Upper Allen Township said in a release.

'The manner in which Cho interacted with these patients was clearly outside the normal doctor and patient relationship.'

Upper Allen Township Police Chief James Adams further criticized Cho for 'creating addicts and/ or advantage of people with addictions for his own personal and perverted desires.'

Hampden Township Police Chief Steven R. Junkin called Cho a predator who did more harm to patients than good.

'A doctor who peddles drugs to addicts and then uses the control of the drugs to profit and further victimize the patient, transitions from practitioner to predator,' he said.

'There is no room in society for these predators and today, with endless hours, exhausting interviews, old fashioned hard work and interagency cooperation; we've hopefully removed this predator's ability to ruin more lives.'

Years of abuse: Jay J. Cho, 71, pictured a few decades earlier, is believed to have gotten at least 12 patients addicted to strong narcotics in order to fulfill his own twisted desires 

The affidavit of probable cause contains numerous and repeated examples of Cho sexually assaulting patients, giving them large amounts of serious controlled substances outside the bounds of accepted pain management practice, meeting with female patients with no staff member in the room and repeatedly contacting female patients outside of the times for their visits, said the police report.

The report said that three of the patients told police that the assaults occurred when the doctor knew they were under extreme stress in their personal lives.

The patients stated that they were afraid of being cut off from the drugs to which they were addicted.

In 2010 a patient filed a police report saying that she had been assaulted by Cho but she never made an official complaint.

In May 2014, another female patient accused him of assault and that’s when police launched another investigation.

One patient review on Vitals.com accused Cho of over prescribing drugs.

'His staff are very immature, not helpful at all! The doctor is very hard to understand. All he is interested in his prescribing pills. This is not true pain management. Stay away! ' wrote an anonymous reviewer.

He apparently has 43 years of experience and has been named as a top doctor in Pennsylvania, according to Vitals.com. 

Medical records for many of the victims were obtained and reviewed by an independent medical expert in Anesthesiology and Pain Management. 

The report states that the amount of opiates prescribed to each patient far exceeded the established standards of care and the that care provided by Dr. Cho fell well below national standards of care.

Cho turned himself into police on Tuesday following a warrant for his arrest for rape, aggravated assault, drug delivery by practitioner, criminal use of a communication facility, indecent assault, possession of a controlled substance and harassment.

Cho is being held on $375,000 bail.
