If you want to be sent home from work, or are thinking about pulling a sickie - this could be the make-up for you.

From 'eye smiles' tape to create the look of puffy  bags, to canine teeth extensions for a crooked smile, Japan's beauty ideals starkly contrast those in the west.

Add to that the latest launch - a red, under-eye blusher - and you have the tools to make yourself look rather unwell in minutes. 

Creator TCB is raising funds on Makuake to  take the Little Red Riding Hood palette into production

The look was pioneered by Ranzuki, a mag with the tagline 'I can be the cutest and most stylish girl in class'

Known as 'byojaku face', the Asian trend involves making yourself look a bit under the weather, and is hugely popular in Japan. 

Online illustrator name TCB on Twitter created the Little Red Riding Hood palette concept, which was inspired by fairy tales.

It has set up a campaign on crowdfunding site Makuake to try to make the idea into a reality. The project has already met its initial goal of 1,000,000 yen (£5,370).

The makeup opens up like a book and features under-eyeshadow in bright red, beige, brown and white.

According to Japanese school girls, a sickly face consists of pale skin and worried brows

Red around the eyes gives the impression that its wearer is slightly fey

Rather than sweeping blusher diagonally along the cheekbone from mouth, or even dabbing it on the apples of your cheeks, the new place for it to go is directly underneath your eyes. 

The red around the eyes gives the impression that its wearer is slightly unwell or as if they've been crying, and in need of looking after.

It can also make you look like you've been outdoors in cold weather - in-keeping with the Mori girl style of 'a girl who lives in the forest' (lace, soft leather, sturdy boots, gypsy tops, patterned tights).

Those who donate 3,500 yen (£18) or more to the effort by the deadline of February 16  will receive a Little Red Riding Hood palette when they go into production in 2015.

Little Red Riding Hood is the manga cover character for this gothic and girly-looking product.  

Known as 'byojaku face', the sickly look has proved hugely popular in Japan

The puffy eyebag look is said to make you look a little bit tired, as if you've been having trouble sleeping

The look was pioneered by Ranzuki, a teen magazine with the tagline 'I can be the cutest and most stylish girl in class'. Popular online site Tokyo Girls Update published a feature on the trend.

Author Kanako Kirita wrote: 'According to Japanese school girls, a sickly face consists of pale skin, worried brows, and slightly tinted cheeks and lips.

'This look gives off the unapproachable, damsel in distress vibe that makes people want to protect them.'

Other sickly makeup trends include aegyo sal, which involves women who do not have a natural pouch under their eyes creating one with a bit of crafty shading or tape.

The  puffy eyebag look is said to make you look a little bit tired, as if you've been having trouble sleeping. The trend is especially popular In Korea.
