A dog believed to belong to British Special Forces has become an unlikely prisoner of the Taliban.

Footage posted online shows bearded gunmen parading the unfortunate animal as a trophy after it was taken during a failed Nato raid in Afghanistan.

The subdued dog, named Colonel, is seen wearing a specially adapted flak jacket as it is held on a chain by one of the fighters.

Taliban fighters claim to have captured a British military dog which was armed with four guns and grenades

It is understood to be attached to an 
elite unit, believed to be either the Special Air Service or its naval 
counterpart, the Special Boat Service.

Locals in Alingar Valley, in the Laghman province, say the dog is being held by a notoriously brutal Taliban commander known as Abu Zarqawi, according to The Telegraph.

But despite their concern, the animal's captors claim it is healthy - and is being fed a diet of chicken and beef kebabs.

Speaking from an undisclosed location, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the dog had become separated from its handlers during the fierce raid in December.

The dog, which was wearing an equipment vest, appeared to be in good condition and did not seem distressed

Unconfirmed reports have suggested that the captured dog was with British forces

'Right now we are keeping the dog and 
trying to look after him,' he told the newspaper by telephone.

'We haven’t decided what to do with it yet. Maybe we will keep it and use it ourselves because it has been trained.'

He added that the fighters had been preparing 'proper food' for the dog, including kebabs.

In
 the video posted by the Taliban's 'cultural arm', an insurgent can be seen holding up
 a GPS tracking device that formed part of the animal's uniform.

The
 jacket also contained a torch and video camera, which are often fitted 
in order to capture reconnaissance material as the animals move around 
on a battlefield.

Fighters can also be seen brandishing weapons allegedly seized at the time, including two 
assault rifles similar to those used by US special forces and a number 
of hand grenades.

Dogs have been deployed by the British Army since the First World War, when they were used to carry messages.

Some
 11,000 canines work in the UK's Armed Forces, sniffing out drugs, 
helping with search and rescue, and searching suspicious buildings 
before soldiers enter.

Dogs can be strapped to their handlers' chests and parachuted into combat zones.  

They
 have reportedly been trained to attack people who are armed, but are 
mainly used to sniff out explosives or explore territory, sending images
 back from cameras attached to their heads.

Their
 sense of smell is 40 times better than a soldier's, meaning they scent 
enemies up to two miles away.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence 
said: 'We do not comment on the activity of Special Forces. We cannot 
confirm the nationality of the animal.'

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force confirmed that an animal went missing during a raid in December.

A Taliban spokesman added: 'This dog was very important to the Americans. 
Once we got this dog, the Americans tried their best to get it back but 
they did not succeed.'

The 
Ministry of Defence said last year that four dogs have been killed in 
service in Helmand province since March 2011 – two labradors, a German 
shepherd and a springer spaniel cross. One of the four was apparently 
shot by the Taliban on a mission.

But while some may fear  for the Taliban's most recent detainee, an Australian dog captured in Afghanistan had a lucky escape.

After being adopted by a  Taliban leader, black labrador Sabi was eventually rescued by an American soldier.

Dogs have been used in war since military records began, and are particularly useful in special forces operations.

In
 2005 in Iraq, one such animal was killed when he detected an ambush 
that even a soldier using night-vision goggles could not see.

The dog ran ahead to attack and was riddled with AK-47 fire, betraying the sniper's position in the process.

Dogs also led the way when the US Navy SEALS raided Osama Bin Laden's Pakistani hideout in 2011.

Animal rights campaigners have expressed their outrage at the use of dogs by British forces in Afghanistan.

People
 for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said: 'Dogs are not tools 
or "innovations" and are not ours to use and toss away like empty 
ammunition shells.'
