Four teenagers arrested in connection with the death of a 40-year-old man who was attacked in a town centre will be kept in custody overnight, police have said.

The death of Glen Kitchens in Worksop is being treated as murder, Nottinghamshire Police said today.

Mr Kitchens, from the Sunnyside area of the town, was taken to hospital after reports of an assault at around 7.30pm in Bridge Street on Saturday, near its junction with Central Avenue and Ryton Street, police said.

He was taken to Bassetlaw District Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The officers said they have arrested three 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old who continue to be questioned.

Tonight a Nottinghamshire Police 
spokesman said: 'Mr Kitchens' relatives are being supported by 
specially-trained detectives at this difficult time.'

He added: 'As part of the murder 
inquiry, detectives are scouring CCTV from the town centre and speaking 
to witnesses in a bid to establish what happened.'

Earlier, speaking outside Worksop 
Police Station, Superintendent Paul Anderson said: 'We would ask for 
members of the public who were in Worksop, specifically Bridge Street, 
at that time if they have seen a group of youths - a mixture of males 
and females - or are in receipt of any information, if they would 
contact Nottinghamshire Police.'

The senior officer said: 'It's a very serious inquiry where a man had died.

'We are treating it at this time as a murder inquiry.'

Mr Anderson added: 'I can reassure the community of Worksop and the wider community that we are taking this very seriously.

'Additional patrols and additional officers have placed in the town centre tonight.

'We do not believe there is any risk to the residents of this town.'

He said a postmortem examination will take place in the next couple of days.

Mr Anderson said he still needed members of the public to come forward despite the arrests that have been made.

An area of the main shopping centre of
Worksop was cordoned off today but the force said 'officers are hoping 
to enable those shops affected by today's disruption to open as normal 
tomorrow'.

Flowers have also been left near the cordon to mark the man's death.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
