It was once a Pontins Holiday Park filled with boisterous families, but this Norfolk centre has been left derelict.

Haunting photos reveal the abandoned park six years after it finally closed for good.

The former Pontins Holiday Park in Hemsby, Norfolk, played host to more than 2,400 guests in its heyday, but eventually closed to the public in 2008.

Even the Queen Victoria pub is boarded up and eerily quiet since the site finally closed down six years ago

The family friendly centre once had everything a holidaymakers needed, from pools and sports courts to a pub for the grown-ups

An old go-kart attraction looks like it has seen better days as moss grows on the signs and grass covers the once tarmacked track

Now cottages, go-karting race tracks, games pitches and even the local pub are falling into ruin at the 20-acre site.

The eerie images show how the once-popular ideal of holiday parks, which were launched in the 1940s and became a staple for families over the following 30 years, have quietly become less fashionable.

Now the only visitors to the 'ghost town' are the wildlife that has moved in and the occasional urban explorer keen to re-visit the sense of forgotten holidays. 

The holiday cottages were once popular self-catering options for families looking for an affordable break in the UK

Locals have complained that the abandoned site has turned into an eyesore, but plans to turn it into a residential area have fallen through

Pontins Holiday Parks were founded by Fred Pontin in 1946 and enjoyed huge success for decades, even launching the careers of TV stars.

While Butlins workers were known as Red Coats, Pontins had its own Blue Coat entertainers. Even the cult British comedy movie Holiday On the Buses was filmed at the Pontins Holiday Park in Prestatyn.

Stars from Bobby Davro and Shane Ritchie to Bradley Walsh launched their careers at Pontins, with former Steps singer Lisa Scott-Lee also crediting her days as a Blue Coast as the start of her entertaining career.

Pontins Holiday Parks were founded by Fred Pontin in 1946 and enjoyed huge success for decades but have fallen out of favour in recent years

The holiday parks were once cutting edge attractions, filled with entertainment for both adults and children, but few still remain open

The parks were sold off several times after 1978 with many closing as holidays abroad became more popular and now only six remain operational.

The land agents for the Hemsby Holiday Park Northern Trust had hoped the site might be developed for residential use but there were objections from local residents and plans were withdrawn.

It remains on the market for tourism and leisure use.

Now the once cutting edge facilities have been left to rot, with locals daubing graffiti on walls and even in the empty pool

Pontins used to hold its own Star Search talent contests and several former workers went on to become TV stars and singers

One local who used to work at the camp at the height of it’s popularity said: ‘It’s hard to imagine this place was always packed with people having happy holidays.

‘What gets me most is the silence because it was always so noisy with kids laughing and screaming and everyone enjoying themselves.

‘The same families would come back year after year because they love it here so much. You wouldn’t believe it to look at it now.

‘Now we joke that it looks more like the set of an apocalypse zombie movie when all the people have disappeared.'

Blue Coat cabaret entertainers at a Pontin's Holiday Camp circa 1993 show how the family-friendly entertainment changed little over the years

From talent show to dance contests, the wholesome holiday parks were beloved for decades
