A student has died following a shooting outside a dorm at South Carolina State University, and police are looking for four men who fled the campus.

The victim has been identified as 
Brandon A. Robinson, 20, who was shot outside of the Hugine Suites 
around 1:30pm Friday, University Police Chief Mernard Clarkson said.

University President Thomas Elzey choked
 back tears as he promised to keep his students safe. He said the 
student killed was a nice young man.

Victim: Brandon Robinson was shot outside a university dorm and later died of his injuries today

Possible suspect: Justin Bernard Singleton's picture was circulated by campus police at Claflin University

Campus Police Chief Mernard Clarkson says police don't know what led to the shooting.

The gunmen left campus before police could catch them, but authorities decided to lock down the campus so they could not return.

'Our students are secure and safe as we keep looking for these individuals,' Clarkson said.

The wounded student was transported to Regional Medical Center, where he later died.

Clarkson did not say what led to the shooting and did not update the wounded student's condition.

He also did not release any details about the suspects.

According
 to WLTX, police at Claflin University, which is located just across the
 street from SC State, issued their own alert to students.

In it, they 
identified one of the suspects as Justin Bernard Singleton of 
Charleston, despite SC State having not identified any of those 
involved.

Sirens sounded across campus after an alert was issued and police secured gates leading into the university.
