This footage shows the moment a man charged with murdering a great-grandmother in her garden went for a cafe meal just two hours before she was killed.

Nicknamed 'Fat Nick', Nicholas Salvador sat and read a newspaper while he ate a quarter-pounder and an egg, according to the footage obtained by The Sun.

Just two hours later he is accused of murdering 82-year-old widow Palmira Silva, who came to London from her native Italy in the 1950s to find a better life.

Meal: Footage showed Nicholas Salvador eating a burger in a cafe. Two hours later he is accused of murder

The CCTV footage from the cafe in Edmonton, north London, was captured just before 10.41am on Thursday.

It shows 25-year-old Salvador walking into the cafe and ordering food before sitting at a table by the shop front in a baggy white T-shirt.

He sat eating for less than five minutes before getting up and walking out, apparently without paying.

A member of cafe staff then went to the door and the footage appears to show him returning to settle the bill.

Waitress Hayley Kaya, 27, told The Sun Salvador had 'looked as if his mind was somewhere else' but added: 'At the time I served him he just seemed like a normal customer.' 

The cafe's owner Ismail Topaloglu, 44, added Salvador had been a customer for around four years.

Just hours later, shortly after 1pm, armed officers descended on the suburb and used tasers to overpower their suspect.

Salvador was charged with murdering Mrs Silva and assaulting a police office.

He appeared yesterday at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Corner in north London, where he was remanded in custody.

His next court appearance will be at the Old Bailey on Tuesday.

The 25-year-old was unemployed and was staying with a friend a few doors from the 82-year-old widow in Edmonton before her murder, according to information obtained by the Daily Mail.

Killed: Great-grandmother Palmira Silva was found beheaded on Thursday in a horrific attack

The would-be cage fighter left home 11 years ago. One friend said: ‘Nicholas is an only child and his parents brought him here from Nigeria. But when he was about 13 or 14 he left home.

'The truth is, he has never felt loved.'

A former classmate at Salisbury School, Edmonton, added: ‘We used to call him St Nicholas because he never got up to anything. He was always saying he wanted a girlfriend.’

Palmira Silva moved to London from her native Italy with her husband Domenico in the 1950s to start a new life.

They married, started a family and began a successful restaurant business with a string of cafes and snack bars across the city.

Investigation: Police at the scene on Thursday in Edmonton, north London

Tributes: Tributes gathered outside one of the London snack bars which had been run by the 82-year-old

Her daughter Celestina, 49, told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s just the most horrendous thing to do to another human being. We simply can’t make any sense of it.

'She knew the area was changing but she was determined to stay. It seems such a dreadful, senseless waste.'
