A growing number of busy parents, with no time to cook for their precious youngsters, are turning to toddler takeout services instead.

But far from your ordinary meal delivery, these pricey and gourmet dropped-to-your-door dinners are organic, made from local fresh produce, full of vegetables, and cater to the most advanced eaters.

According to the New York Post, Brooklyn-based Komi Organics charges $180 for delivery of five lunches and five dinners from a menu serving grilled Arctic char with herbed quinoa, julienned red pepper and cucumber; and peach noodle kugel with Swedish meatballs.

Toddler takeout: A growing number of busy parents, with no time to cook for their precious youngsters, are turning to food delivery services such as Junior's Fresh instead

Meanwhile Junior’s Fresh, one of New York City's most well-known toddler-specific takeout brands, charges $40 for five meals - a menu including tarragon scented organic chicken breast with sweet potato over candy cane, beet barley risotto and golden raisins.

But before these gourmet meal deliveries for the preschool set are dismissed as lazy and unnecessary, working parents argue it is an effective way to spend more quality time with their children.

Natasha Gural-Maiello, 41, mother of 
two-year-old Michael Alexander, says she has five Junior’s Fresh lunches delivered in a special refrigeration 
pack every Tuesday at 10am.

She told the New York Post's Jane Ridely: 'It’s important to me to provide my son with healthy, locally sourced 
food. Since I work from home with only a part-time nanny, it
really helps me optimize the time I spend with him.'

Michael Alexander's favorite dish is the Little League Burger, an organic turkey 
slider stuffed with barley, kale and raisins on a brioche bun.

His meals
are usually dropped off by Michelle Hoffmann, 37, who 
founded the company and says business has grown 500per cent since she launched in the spring 2011.

Mommy’s Yummies is another popular toddler takeout service, where a supply of six meals costs between $50 and $65, and features items like sweet potato bisque with basil pasta with zucchini.

Meanwhile Petit Organics, a pureed baby-food delivery firm, will join the toddler-takeout trend this 
spring, adding dishes for children age two and up. Currently three days worth of its allergen-free pureed meals costs $48.

Michelle Marinis, 30, and co-founder of Petit Organics, said: 'It’s got to the point where we’re all educated on fresh ingredients and how it’s the best way to go [rather than] shelf-stable food with all the additives and chemicals.

'People are trying to do the right thing with nutrition at every stage of childhood.'

Mother of 15-month-old twins, Rebecca Baseggio, 41, buys $144 worth of baby food from
Petit Organics every week, and acknowledges that it is a 'giant indulgence,' but one she justifies easily.

'Other parents spend huge amounts of 
money on vacations and designer clothes,' she says. 'We’d much rather the boys dressed in hand-me-downs 
and ate wholesome food. We’re convinced it will give them the best 
possible start in life.'

Mother-of-three Nicole Cain, 35, uses Komi Organics regularly and says it is essential that her children 'eat a diverse range of food and get the right amount of carbs, proteins and vegetables.'

'My
kids are really into trying new things, and their palates are becoming 
quite sophisticated,' she said. 'This really takes the headache out of 
mealtimes.'

Komi Organics founder Nokomis Pfeiffer, 36, says she uses a lot of vegetables, fish and whole grain - 'the kind of things which are difficult to get little kids to eat,' she admitted.

'I feel great when the parents say their kid enjoyed every bite.'
