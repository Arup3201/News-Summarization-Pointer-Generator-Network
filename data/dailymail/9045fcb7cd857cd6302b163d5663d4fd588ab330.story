No extra portion: Children in Wales have been refused seconds in a bid to tackle child obesity (stock image)

Hungry schoolchildren are being refused seconds in a bid to stop levels child obesity levels rising.

Pupils in Welsh schools have been told they will not receive an additional portion by kitchen staff so they can adopt sensible eating habits.

The strict mealtime policies have been introduced as figures reveal that children as young as 14 are receiving gastric bands on the NHS.

Council staff have also stopped youngsters from having extra puddings because of their sugar content.

In Cardiff, if children are still hungry, they are given dry bread in order to control their appetite, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Latest figures show 22 per cent of 
children are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school while the number of children treated in hospitals for weight-related issues has risen by 400 per cent.

Since 2007, 45 teenagers have had gastric bands, bypasses or stomach staples fitted with the youngest being 14, according to figures released in Parliament.

Children are currently weighed and 
measured in the first and last year of primary school in a bid to 
monitor and tackle the problem.

Current guidelines suggest pupils below the age of 11 should receive 530 calories per two-course meal while children in
 secondary schools get 646 calories.

The Welsh Government is to issue guidelines on extra portions in the new year in a bid to tackle the problem.

More than 25 per cent of 
five-year-olds in Wales are overweight with 12.5 per cent classed as 
obese, a figure higher than in England and Wales.

A spokesman said they 'did not want to see their children go hungry' but had handed out recommended portion sizes.

Strict policies: The Welsh Government is introducing the guidelines for extra meals next year

The new figures, which were uncovered as part of a BBC Wales survey, found that Powys Council has banned pudding as seconds while Cardiff schools offer only extra bread to hungry pupils.

Russell George, the Conservative Assembly Member for Montgomery, asked parents if children were returning from school still hungry because they did not receive enough food.

More than two-thirds said portions were too small, 93 per cent wanted their children to have seconds, and 10 per cent stopped using school meals because of portion sizes.

Mr George told the paper: 'Many older children are complaining they remained hungry following their school meal
