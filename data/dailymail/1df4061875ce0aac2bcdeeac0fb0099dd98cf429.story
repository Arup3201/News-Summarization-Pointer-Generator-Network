He used to be a Gunner so it's no surprise that Sol Campbell has become a sharp-shooter for real.

The former England, Arsenal and Spurs defender has revealed he loves to dress up in the latest country gear and shoot birds.

'I managed to shoot 11 birds having never picked up a gun before,' boasted Campbell in an interview with Shooting Gazette magazine, out on Thursday.

Campbell, who retired from playing football officially in 2012 and has since kept himself busy off the field, spoke about his desire to coach anywhere in the world.

'I'm in the last six months of my Pro-License Coaching Badges training,' Campbell said.

'Once those are completed I'll be able to coach around the world at any level.

'I'm also helping out the Conservatives on various issues to do with sport and diversity,' said the 40-year-old. 

The former Gunner found himself enjoying shooting having been introduced to the pastime by his wife's family.

'I've only just started really. My wife's family kept inviting me to shoot and I just didn't want to go, but since retiring from football I've had more time and I thought... let's get all the kit and practice,' added Campbell.

'I didn't want all the gear and no idea, so that was my starting point – shooting clays.

'I do like the attire. I have all sorts of country clothing because we live in Northumberland as well as London. You need good quality gear.

'The style is important to me, but the quality goes hand-in-hand with it. I love the fabrics, the materials and the cuts. I love the whole sporting side of it.

'This year I shot about 30 birds. That was a mixture of birds. The banter was just lovely.

'As long as the birds end up on a dinner table and people are enjoying them, then that's fine. That's the point for me. I wouldn't want to go deer stalking, that's just not for me.'
