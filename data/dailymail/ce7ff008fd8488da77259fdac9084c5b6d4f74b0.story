A fugitive conman who is though to have fled to the Costa Del Sol has had two properties seized by police seeking to retreive some of the £300,000 he made in financial scams.

Tony Murphy, who is also a known associate of a notorious drug dealer, travelled around the world to Egypt, America and Thailand on holidays while raking in thousands from credit card, loan and mortgage cons.

Despite tax records showing he declared just £2,232 earnings over six years, Murphy, 40, managed to fund a lavish lifestyle.

He also bought two homes, one in Urmston and the other in Hale, both in Greater Manchester, and kept up the mortgage payments.

The two properties, along with cash found at the homes, were subject to a confiscation Order after a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Minshull Street Crown Court to the value of £121,099.

Patrick Goodrich, of Operation Bank, a multi-agency unit which investigates organised crime, said the hearing showed how they would relentlessly pursue criminals.

He said: 'We will get the money back through the sale of his assets. These two houses were the proceeds of organised crime.

'Essentially, what we are saying is that these homes were connected to organised crime gangs. When you look at the history of these houses you can see that.

'This has weakened that gang. It also teaches criminals that we are relentless in our pursuit of them and their assets and we will use different tactics in our power to get to them.'

Mr Goodrich said this was the culmination of an intensive two-year investigation.

He added: 'But we are willing to work for that long for something that is valuable to our communities - and these organised crime gangs are a blight on our communities.'

When officers raided Murphy’s homes last year, they found pictures of him posing with animals during a trip to a foreign zoo and paragliding in Egypt.

Murphy (dressed as a gangster in a picture found by police at his home) fled before his sentencing in February and is now thought to be hiding out in Spain

They also found passports filled with stamps of the countries he had visited.

On his walls were posters of Robert De Niro in Scarface.

Murphy, from Hale, pleaded guilty at Manchester Minshull Street Crown in January and July last year to two counts of fraud, four counts of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception and one charge of acquiring criminal property.

But he fled before sentencing and is now thought to be hiding out in Spain.

He was sentenced in his absence in February to two-and-a-half years in prison.

The court heard that despite being unemployed, Murphy secured credit cards, a mortgage and loans by creating different professions for the accounts.

Murphy bought the house in Hale for £225,000 and the other in Urmston, for £90,000. He got a secured loan on the Urmston house and four credit cards by lying on his applications and admitted handling £30,000 of cash which was gained through crime.

During Operation Bank's investigation of Murphy, they discovered he knew convicted drug dealer James Maxwell, in part through a picture of the pair together found in the police raid.

Maxwell, 35, is serving a 22-year sentence in a US jail for importing and possessing and conspiring to supply ecstasy.

Detectives want any ex-pats in Spain who recognise Murphy to call 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
