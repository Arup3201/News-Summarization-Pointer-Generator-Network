A shipwrecked fisherman who miraculously survived in the Pacific Ocean by clinging to a foam icebox for two days has revealed how he was just minutes from drowning when he was rescued.

Father-of-five Salazar Solano was plucked from the water in a 'terrible' state by the Colombian Navy some 20 miles off the coast  after his small fishing boat capsized.

He spent the two freezing nights clutching the cover of a Styrofoam drinks cooler after deciding not to take lifejackets apparently because they were deemed too expensive and unnecessary.

Speaking to MailOnline while recovering at home in his fishing village of Bocagrande, Mr Solano says his entire body aches and still feels seasick, but is thrilled to be alive.

'I was about to die,' he said. 'I couldn't hold out any longer.'

Miraculous: Fisherman Salazar Solano shows his injuries to his arms and body after surviving for two days in the Pacific Ocean by clinging to a Styrofoam ice box until the Colombian Navy plucked him from the water

Lesson learned: Mr Solano spent two days clutching the cover of a drinks cooler which he used to store red snapper after he decided not to take lifejackets apparently because they were too expensive

The 47-year-old and a friend, Tomás Contreras, set sail from the town of Lopez in the south of the country on Friday, October 31, but came into difficulties in stormy conditions.

By 1am on Saturday, Mr Solano and Mr Contreras hauled up their nets and filled the ice box with red snapper. 

But then the 22ft-long fibreglass boat began filling with water due to high waves and, possibly, a leak.

The two men tried to bail out the water, but it came in even faster and the boat sagged to one side.

They tried to jerry-rig a sail out of a tarp to catch the wind and right the boat, but it was too late.

Mr Solano had bothered to take a lifejacket because he felt he was a very good swimmer.

Alexis Bonilla, another fisherman from Bocagrande, also said hardly anyone in the village owns a lifejacket because they are expensive and – when all goes well - unnecessary. 

Instead, Mr Solano grabbed the cover of the Styrofoam ice box, broke in in two, gave one piece to Mr Contreras and clung to the other.

He also removed his belt and, with a flashlight, fashioned himself a headlamp. Then the boat went down.

At that time, they were only a few miles off the coast but, in the dark, they couldn't get their bearings to swim in the right direction. 

By sunrise on Saturday, they realised they were going the wrong way.

'The current kept taking us farther out to sea,' Solano said. 'We could no longer see the shore. We were both swimming and both getting tired.'

The Colombian Navy has an emergency telephone line for such cases. 

Its vessels are constantly patrolling the Pacific coast often in search of drug traffickers who move cocaine to Central America and Mexico in fast boats and even homemade submarines. 

This coastal region is remote and nearly road-less thus people get around on ferries, speed boats and canoes.  

Incident: Mr Solano, 47, and a friend set sail from the town of Lopez in the south of the country on Friday, but two days later strong winds caused their vessel to overturn 21 miles from the coast

Lucky: Mr Solano was rushed back to short and taken to hospital, but despite his near-death ordeal, was found to be suffering from nothing but dehydration. He is expected to make a full recovery

When motors break down or vessels run aground, the Navy is often called in to pick up marooned passengers.

But Mr Solano and Mr Contreras had told family members that they expected to return home late Sunday, so no-one in Bocagrande thought to call the Navy's rescue line.

By Sunday morning, with Mr Contreras growing weaker, the two men drifted apart and Mr Solano lost track of his fishing partner. 

Now 22 nautical miles off shore, he prepared for the end.

'My life was nothing,' Mr Solano said. 'What mattered to me was my family'.

By sheer coincidence, the Colombian Navy's ARC Nariño corvette was at that moment plowing through the sea nearby. 

Just before midday, the ship's spotters, who are on deck 24 hours a day, in part, to avoid accidents with tiny fishing boats, spied something suspicious floating in the water.

Solano saw the Naval vessel and started yelling.

'The ship was not on a mission to look for him,' says Lt. José Dominguez, a Navy press officer. 

'It was out patrolling, doing normal operations like looking for drug boats. It was almost a miracle that we found him.'

Miraculous: Salazar Solano, 47, survived two nights in the open ocean by clinging to a Styrofoam icebox

Sailors tossed him a flotation device, but by that point he was too weak to swim for it.

A Navy diver jumped in to help the bedraggled castaway who was still grasping the ice box cover. 

Clad in a T-shirt, green short and his homemade headlamp, the exhausted survivor was hoisted aboard on a stretcher.

'He was in terrible condition,' said Captain Orlando Cubillos, the ship's commander. 'We got there just in time.'

Solano was taken to a Navy hospital and treated for dehydration and sunburn. Then, he caught a boat back to Bocagrande where villagers had no idea he'd almost died.

It was a bittersweet homecoming because Contreras is still missing. Solano, who is taking antibiotics, remains weak but is expected to recover.

'Fishing is his life,' said Lt. Dominguez, of the by-the-book Navy, who frowns at Solano's disregard for safety but marvels at his resourcefulness. 'He is a sea wolf.'

Solano's story has captivated Colombia where maritime lore is rife with miraculous tales of survival.

The most famous incident involved the sinking of a Navy ship overloaded with contraband and its sole survivor, a sailor who climbed aboard a life raft then fought off thirst, sharks and the blazing sun for the next 10 days. 

Published in 1955 in daily newspaper installments, 'The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor' was written by an aspiring Colombian novelist named Gabriel García Márquez.
