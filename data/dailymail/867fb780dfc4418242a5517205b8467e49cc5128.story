Two of four childhood friends who moved into a college apartment together after graduating from high school have died after the home was ravaged by flames in an early-morning blaze.

Ross Livermore, 21, was killed in the fire in Eau Claire, Wisconsin on Monday while Jacob Clarkson, 22, sustained serious burns and later died at Hennepin County Medical Center, authorities said.

Two other childhood friends who also shared the apartment above a real estate office, 21-year-olds Casey Malan and Garret Isakson, managed to escaped the flames with minor injuries.

The four inseparable students had met at school in 
Stillwater, Minnesota when they were eight years old and, bonded by 
their love for music, all went on to attend the University of 
Wisconsin-Eau Claire.

It remains unclear what caused the fire but Deputy Fire Chief Scott Burkart told the Minnesota Star Tribune it did not appear suspicious. Their investigation is focused on a back bedroom, he added.

A police detective driving to work at
5.45am on Monday saw flames coming from the windows of the 
second-storey apartment and alerted authorities.

Isakson and Malan had managed to 
escape. Firefighters rescued the two others students, who were unconscious, and took them to hospital, where they were later pronounced 
dead.

Isakson and Malan were also taken to hospital where they were treated and later released.

The fire was under control within two
hours, but damage to the building topped $100,000. The property 
is not school-owned and not subject to its inspections, Deputy Fire 
Chief Burkart said.

Authorities said there were three smoke alarms in the home, but the battery was out of one. They are looking into whether the others had also been disabled, CBS Minnesota reported.

Families and friends have paid tribute to the boys, who developed a special friendship while taking part in the school band. Facebook photographs of the students reveal their senses of humour and antics as they attend social events together.

Connie Isakson, the mother of Garret, recounted how her son played sax, Malan played drums and Livermore and Clarkson played trombones  in the band at Stillwater Area High School.

After graduating three years ago, they all took up studies at the university in Eau Claire, Livermore studying computer science, Clarkson taking physics, Isakson management and Malan English.

'It was a special kind of friendship,' Mrs Isakson recalled through tears. 'They were always together. And it went beyond just them. 
They knew - we all knew - each other's extended families, too. I'm hurting as much for them as I am for Garret.'

Friends remembered Ross Livermore, a sophomore who was taking approved leave from the university, as a popular student who conducted summertime music programs for children.

'Ross was extremely hardworking,' college friend Mike Malone told the Star Tribune. 'He was responsible, but fun. He was kind of a big prankster.'

Family members also paid tribute to Clarkson, who leaves behind a long-term girlfriend, Anna.

'Today we said goodbye to our son, brother, uncle, grandson, nephew and cousin, Jacobs,' they said in a statement. 'We are so proud of him – and we will miss him more than words can say.'

They added that he 'enjoyed life' and would be honoring his decision to be an organ donor so that other lives could be enjoyed as well.

Isakson had moved into the apartment with his friends after taking time off university to undergo a major surgery, his mother said. He had endured 'a rough couple of years', she said.

As he escaped from the fire, Garret burned his hand on a doorknob and burned his back and shoulder trying to get through a doorway, the Star Tribune reported.

The university told the paper it has offered its support to Isakson and Malan, who lost all their possessions in the fire, by providing clothing, food and shelter for them.
