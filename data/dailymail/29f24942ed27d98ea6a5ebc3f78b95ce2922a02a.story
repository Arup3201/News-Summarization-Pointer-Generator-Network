When Garth Brooks turned 50 two years ago, he planned to mark his half century birthday by jumping out of a plane and parachuting to the ground. But his worrywart wife, Trisha Yearwood, put the kibosh on his plans, fearing he’d end up with the one parachute that wouldn't open.

So when Brooks found out about a place where he could actually experience the adrenalin-charged sensation of making that leap, only in a totally safe environment, he jumped at the chance.

Birdman: Garth Brooks was all set to go sky-diving two years ago on his 50th, but Trisha Yearwood grounded her country star husband. But where there's a will there's a way

‘Garth was all set to go sky-diving two years ago on his 50th, but Trish had a fit when she heard about his birthday plans,’ says a source close to the couple. 

‘She pleaded with him to stay grounded, and not wanting to upset her he agreed. 

Then last month, when he and Trish were in Rosemont, Illinois for their Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood, someone in his camp told him about this place called iFLY where, after just a brief training session, you can experience what it feels like to jump out of plane.

'He was gung-ho to give it a go, ’ says the friend.

‘Garth tried to convince Trisha to join him but she wasn’t interested, however a few of his crew members were anxious to take the plunge, so he treated them all to the $69.95 session, which allowed them to experience two, 60 second jumps and receive a certificate saying they’d done the deed.'

Don't do it! Trisha Yearwood was sure hubby Garth's parachute would fail if he did the real thing

The facility, located just a couple miles from where Trisha and Garth performed, uses the same type of fans that are used by the military when they train their paratroopers. 

‘The iFLY experience is made possible utilizing a technology called the “vertical wind tunnel,” which was historically used by military and professional skydivers for training,’ iFlY’s spokesperson, Alexandra Jakubiak, tells Mail Online exclusively. 

Four powerful, high-efficiency axial fans are mounted at the top of the building, channeling air down the side tunnels into the basement, and then up through the floor through a 14-foot-wide circular flight chamber, creating a strong upward draft. 

‘This column of air, which ranges in speed from approximately 80 to 175 miles per hour (depending on the weight and expertise level of the flyer), creates a stable, safe, wall-to-wall airflow that gently pushes guests aloft and makes it possible for them to fly. 

Garth and his friends put on flight suits, goggles and helmets, and they had a great time,’ says Jakubiak. 'Garth happily posed for photos and signed autographs, and we certainly hope to see them all back again soon.’
