When Ryan Gauld emerged through the arrivals gate at Edinburgh Airport on Thursday afternoon he looked like any other young kid returning from a trip in the sun.

Unassuming, understated in many ways, the 18-year-old is still at an age where a week’s holiday in Portugal would be grounds for parental concern.

He could have easily been ignored by the massed ranks of travellers had it not been for the media scrum that formed his welcoming committee. One can only assume that in the days, months and years ahead this level-headed teenager will cope with being centre of attention.

Should he deal with it in the same assured manner with which he has his £3million move to Sporting Lisbon then his nearest and dearest need have no concerns.

‘It’s been a bit of a crazy last few days and I’m glad it’s all sorted now,’ Gauld said on his return from Lisbon after signing the deal that has Scottish football aflutter.

‘They’ve paid a big price but hopefully I can put in big performances for them and establish myself and do well.

‘It will be hard to leave home and learn a new language but I’m really looking forward to it, it’s going to be a good challenge for myself and I’m really looking forward to it.

‘When I first heard of the interest, I was kind of overwhelmed by it.

‘But the club have been great through it all; they’ve not stood in my way, they’ve let me speak to them and helped the deal go through so I’m really grateful for that.

‘The fans have been absolutely superb ever since I played my first game, they supported me even when I was not playing too well.

‘I would like to thank them for that and also the coaches at Dundee United, they are the ones that have developed me as a player, and the gaffer has given me a chance to show what I can.

‘I would just like to say thanks for everyone at Dundee United for giving me this chance. Since I was young I’ve always wanted to play abroad so hopefully it will live up to what I’m expecting.’

Sporting have famously produced players such as Ronaldo and Luis Figo. In Sportsmail on Thursday, Gauld was posing for photographs in front of pictures of the celebrated pair as Sporting unveiled the playmaker.

But the 18-year-old, from the small Aberdeenshire town of Laurencekirk, played down suggestions of following in their footsteps.

‘I’m not really thinking of that just now, I’m just thinking of looking forward to playing for the club and trying to make a good show of myself.

‘They’re two very good players but I’m just concentrating on myself. Everyone knows it’s a great club, a very big club, good at developing younger players. That’s played a bit part in my signing.

‘They’re just looking forward to me going over for training and we’ll see how it goes from there.

‘The deal shows that they’re not expecting too much, too soon - it’s probably a long-term investment.’

Yet amid all the hoopla which has surrounded Gauld’s transfers there has come a word of caution.

Aside from almost 400 goals for clubs and country, Ian Rush’s lasting gift to the game was a quote which will follow him to his grave.

‘I couldn’t settle in Italy,’ the striker famously said of his solitary season with Juventus which bisected his 15 years at Liverpool. ‘It was like living in a foreign country.’

Whether or not the Welshman had his tongue firmly planted in his cheek or not when recalling that dismal term in Turin isn’t really the point. Rush’s meagre return of just seven goals in season 1987-88 after the Italians had paid out £3m was miles short of what was expected from a marksman who had no equal in the English game at that stage.

By the time he shuffled back to Merseyside a year later - to the slight embarrassment of all concerned - his place as the poster boy for British players bombing abroad was forever assured.

He has not suffered alone, however. Paul Gascoigne scored just six goals for Lazio in three years. Jonathan Woodgate’s nine appearances for Real Madrid cost approximately £1.5m a throw while Stan Collymore lasted just five weeks with Oviedo before announcing his retirement.

Mercifully, for Sporting Lisbon’s latest recruit, there are sufficient cases of Brits who have thrived in foreign climes to take no shortage of encouragement. Call Steve McManaman, John Collins or even Joe Jordan to the stand.

Russell Latapy first treaded the foreign boards with Portuguese side Academica before moving to Porto, Boavista and then memorably Hibs.

And while the current Inverness assistant manager believes Sporting’s famed development of young players makes it the perfect fit for Gauld, Latapy believes that success on the park can only come if there’s firstly a degree of contentment off it.

‘They are lovely people in Portugal. They remind me a lot of the Scots,’ Latapy said. ‘It’s a lovely culture also. Whoever goes there will have a wonderful time.

‘It’s like everything else. Wherever you go, people assess the type of person you are, the kind of personality you have and treat you accordingly. It’s the same with Scottish people.

‘Ryan’s a great kid and he’s going to a fantastic club. It’s one that’s produced some of the best young talent in Portugal. He’s going there at the right age and I’m sure he’s going to have an opportunity to play. He will have a wonderful time.

‘What I would say is it’s always important you learn the language as it helps you to adapt a lot faster.

‘I’m sure they will help Ryan adapt and provide things like language teachers to help him learn the language.’

Gauld is a smart kid, however. Not too old for his years but certainly intelligent, mature and not lacking in confidence.

His vision for the future – as laid out in an interview earlier this season – made for interesting, prophetic reading. He foresaw himself not in the English Premier League one day but in a more technical league where 5ft 6in players weren’t trampled underfoot. Spain was his stated preference and he wasn’t far out.

Latapy – no stranger himself to the demands of being a creative midfielder – certainly believes both Sporting and the Primeira Liga are good fits for the Dundee United product.

‘He’s at a club that’s always been great with young players,’ he added. ‘If you talk about some of the young players that have come through there you are looking at Cristiano Ronaldo, Figo, Nani, Joao Moutinho. So many of the best young Portuguese talent has come through Sporting.

‘The thing about Portugal is the game is really technical. They like to have the ball on the ground and to play it to feet which will suit Ryan.

‘If he is going to continue to progress in the way he did last season then the challenges are the normal ones - keeping fit, adapting and learning as much as he can.

‘He’s an exciting young player. Give him the ball and he makes things happen in the offensive third.

‘That’s a serious asset in today’s football.’
