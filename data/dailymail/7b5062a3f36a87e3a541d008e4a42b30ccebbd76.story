The highly-anticipated trial of a millionaire husband who allegedly shot his wife in the face at their home will soon be getting underway.

Jury selection is taking place in Orlando, Florida, for the trial of James Robert ‘Bob’ Ward, 63, who claims his wife committed suicide.

It will be another huge murder trial for the Orange County court, where Casey Anthony was cleared of murdering her little daughter in July.

Couple: Bob Ward, 63, called 911 from the $2.2million house in September 2009 and told a dispatcher five times he had shot his wife Diane, 55, in the face

Ward called 911 from the house in September 2009 and told a dispatcher five times he had shot his wife Diane, 55, in the face, reported ABC News.

Their $2.2million home was in Isleworth, Florida - once a community home to top golfers Tiger Woods and Arnold Palmer.

Ward's wife was due to take part in a financial investigation against him just days after the shooting happened.

The developer was facing allegations of taking money from his companies to support a lavish lifestyle, reported ABC News.

‘She's dead. She's done. I'm sorry,’ he said in the 911 call, before allegedly later telling police he was concerned about his wife and children.

‘I have two kids in college and it's a nightmare, but we probably need to go ahead and get a lawyer in here,’ he told police in questioning.

But he allegedly began to change his story under interrogation, claiming his wife pulled the trigger as he was trying to get hold of the gun.

She had high antidepressant levels and alcohol levels in her system - according to court documents, reported ABC.

But his upbeat mood during questioning surprised detectives – and he was also seen on video calling relatives to tell them his wife had died.

What James Robert 'Bob' Ward told police in questioning

‘It was an accident and I will tell you more about it later - but it was a very tragic accident,’ he told someone in a videoed call.

In a prison video he was seen dancing and laughing with his daughter and sister-in-law, describing jail as ‘the Ritz’.

Prosecutors contend his DNA was discovered on the gun and his wife was shot from over a foot away, so suicide was unlikely.

Ward has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. A jury is not expected to be finalised on Tuesday, reported the Orlando Sentinel.
