Facebook's share price today hit an all time low of $19.82 which values the social networking giant at almost half its May initial offering price of $38.

The companyâ€™s stock dropped 88 cents on Thursday, dropping to its new low after the company posted disappointing earnings last week.

It also directly followed the revelation today there are now more than 83 million fake users on its social network.

The astonishing figure makes up 8.7% of all Facebook's 995 million active users.

The true scale of the problem was hidden in a company filing published this week, the first since the firm went public.

Duplicate profiles made up 4.8% of the fakes, user-misclassified accounts amounted to 2.4%, and 1.5% of users were described as 'undesirable'.

There were 83.09 million fake users in total, which Facebook classified in three groups.

The largest group were duplicate accounts, such as those set up by people to keep their activities from their partner.

The firm defined them as 'an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account.'

Since Facebook's original IPO in May the share price of the social networking giant has fallen to an all time low of $19.82

Others imaginary users were described as 'user-misclassified' where, Facebook said 'users have created personal profiles for a business, organisation, or non-human entity such as a pet'.

Users have created pages for cats, dogs and other animals.

There were also a large number of 'undesirable' accounts were profiles deemed to be in breach of Facebook's terms of service.

These accounts were believed to have been set up to send out junk email messages.

The reason for the drop is due to the fact that Facebookâ€™s first tier of restrictions go away on August 16,
when about 271 million shares will be available for trading,
with another 243 million shares set to become available for
trading between mid-October and mid-November.

But the day most investors are bracing for is Nov. 14, when
more than 1.2 billion shares will suddenly be available for
trading.

The imminent lock-up expiration also means that Wall Street
analysts who participated in the Facebook IPO will once again go
quiet, for a 30-day period, potentially creating more
uncertainty in a stock that has experienced one of the rockiest
market debuts in memory.

'The sentiment on this thing is so negative,' said Topeka Capital 
Markets analyst Victor Anthony. 'I think this thing may continue to tick
 down until you see some sort of meaningful catalyst which unfortunately
 may not show until third-quarter earnings.'

On Wednesday, Facebook's director of platform partnerships, Ethan 
Beard, and the director of platform marketing, Katie Mitic, each 
separately announced plans to leave the company. They represent the 
latest of several departures -- including that of Facebook's chief 
technology officer in June -- since the IPO.

The admission comes as Facebook is attempting to recover from a shambolic public offering.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is estimated to have seen his own personal fortune fall from $13.7 billion to just over $10 billion in the space of a week.

It now hopes to make money by persuading firms to set up brand pages - but the sheer number of fake users could harm this approach and make the public wary of pages.

A BBC investigation last month concluded that a rash of fake profiles was a major cause for concern for Facebook advertisers, although the firm told the BBC it had 'not seen evidence of a significant problem,'

The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones set up a fake company called VirtualBagel to investigate allegations of fake 'likes'.

His investigation found that the large majority of 'likes' for the fake firm originated from the Middle East and Asia.

The first American company to debut with a market valuation of more 
than $100 billion, Facebook has fallen out of favor on Wall Street as 
investors fret about its slowing revenue growth.

In the second quarter, Facebook reported revenue growth of 32 
percent, compared with the more than 100 percent growth it delivered at 
the same time last year.
