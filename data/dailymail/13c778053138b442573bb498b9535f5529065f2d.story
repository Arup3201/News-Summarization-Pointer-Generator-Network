The greatest guitar riff of all time, as chosen by BBC Radio 2 listeners, will be revealed today.

Station presenters will count down the top 100 in a series of programmes throughout the Bank Holiday before Zoe Ball announces the top track while standing in for Steve Wright.

A panel of music experts, including music critics, record producers and the station's presenters, helped produce the top 100, which spans generations.

The guitar riff in Whole Lotta Love by Led Zeppelin features on the BBC Radio 2 top 100 list. Pictured is Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page performing on stage in 1975

David Bowie's guitar riff for Ziggy Stardust also made the list, which will be narrowed down to a winner today

Slash, the lead guitarist from Guns N' Roses, plays guitar at a concert in 2007. His classic riff in the song Sweet Child O'Mine is also on the BBC Radio 2 list

Launched last month by Radio 2's Simon Mayo as part of its Guitar Season, a poll asked listeners to cast their vote online for their favourite guitar riff.

David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, Arctic Monkeys' Do I Wanna Know?, Guns N' Roses' Sweet Child O'Mine and Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit all feature.

Others include Livin' On A Prayer by Bon Jovi, Pink Floyd's Money, Whole Lotta Love by Led Zeppelin and The Kinks' You Really Got Me.

Panel expert and Radio 2 presenter Janice Long said: 'I can't wait to hear if any of mine make it. It was a tough job but I am so happy I got to do it.'
