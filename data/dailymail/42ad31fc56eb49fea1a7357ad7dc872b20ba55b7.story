The average Briton believes they will only consume 3,000 calories on Christmas Day.

But in reality, most of us will eat and drink our way through 7,000 calories in just one sitting and then spend most of January trying to burn it off.

According to new research, most people have no idea that they will triple their recommended daily calorie allowance (2,000 for women and 2,500 for men) on the most indulgent day of the year.

The average Brit believes they only consume 3,000 calories on Christmas Day, but really they eat 7,000. A roast potato is 200 calories, Christmas pudding is 330 and pigs in blankets are 97 apiece

In a new survey, more than a third of people said they would only consume 3,000 calories, with just two per cent correctly estimating 7,000 - 29 per cent thought they would eat less than 3,000 calories.

Roast potatoes, at 200 calories each, were named the favourite part of the festive dinner, followed by turkey at 303 calories for three slices, then sausages wrapped in bacon at 97 calories each.

Champagne, at 133 calories a glass, was the top tipple to accompany the Christmas meal, which contains 1,450 calories, followed by Mulled wine at 119 per glass, then Baileys at 180.

Then there's the extra chocolate, mince pies, nuts, crisps and biscuits that leave most of us feeling as rotund as Santa himself by the time we go to bed.

It would take more than 10 hours of running, cycling at more than 20mph for seven hours, climbing stairs for eight hours and skipping for 12 hours to burn off the 7,000 calories consumed on Christmas Day

It would take more than 10 hours of running, cycling at more than 20mph for seven hours, climbing stairs for eight hours and skipping for 12 hours to burn off the 7,000 calories consumed on Christmas Day.

The survey into the nation's eating, drinking and exercise habits was carried out for Prestige Boot Camp. 

Head Trainer Iain Reitze said: 'It does show how little people are aware of the calorie content of the food they eat.

'We over-eat at the best of times but Christmas Day is off the scale. People seem to resign themselves to putting weight on over the holidays and worry about their weight in the New Year.

'I'd say if you don't want to gain weight, then maybe fill up on vegetables, drink water in between alcoholic drinks, go for a walk before and after your dinner and try not to have too many treats.

'Enjoy Christmas, of course, but many people go from being healthy to completely binging on food and drink and it leaves them feeling sluggish and bad about themselves.'

Losing weight was the top New Year's Resolution with 28 per cent of people saying it was their aim for 2015

Harriet Frew, an eating disorder specialist, agrees and says she speaks to many people, women in particular, whose self-esteem takes a nose-dive after the holidays.

She said: 'People feel they have permission to have a blowout because it's Christmas. A lot of this is done in a dissociated state and the pounds pile on without us even noticing.

'In our Western culture, weight gain is inextricably linked to failure and getting it wrong.

'People feel self-loathing and self-criticism following their Christmas binge and wake up in the New Year berating themselves and planning the next diet.

'Then they often go to the other extreme with strict diets, new regimes and unrealistic goads that are ultimately unsustainable.'

Not surprisingly, losing weight was the top New Year's Resolution with 28 per cent of people saying it was their aim for 2015, followed by drinking less alcohol (19 per cent), getting fit (17 per cent) and eating healthily (15 per cent).

Out of the group, more than one in five – 22 per cent - said they did no exercise at all, but nearly the same percentage, 19 per cent, said they trained more than five times each week.

Iain added:'Most people said that their stomach was the body part they would most like to change, with more than half saying they were unhappy with theirs, followed by legs at 24, arms at 14 per cent and bottom at one per cent.

'The stomach is the problem area for a lot of the women I see and they usually admit they like to drink wine. 

'Not only is this high in calories, but it's strong too, so means they are likely to reach for unhealthy foods while they are drinking and afterwards.

'Christmas is the worst time ever for this but I think that if people are conscious about what they eat, they can get through the holidays without doing too much damage to their waistline.

'I think it's really positive to see a lot of people are already doing exercise, or certainly plan to in the New Year and hope to cut back on unhealthy food and alcohol.

'So many people try new diets or regimes in January, and I think it's important to make sure you find a plan you can stick too, rather than do a drastic or faddy one and set yourself up for a fall.

'My message would be to try to eat clean and exercise when you can each day all year round, then you can enjoy Christmas without piling on the pounds.'
