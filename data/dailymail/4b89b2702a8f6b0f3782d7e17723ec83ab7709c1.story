The British businessman on trial for murdering his fiancee at a five-star hotel in Paris, had allegedly crashed his Mercedes into her house, and beat her up, just one month earlier, a court heard today.

Ian Griffin, 45, drove his car into the £3million home of Kinga Legg, 36, in Oxshott, Surrey, just weeks before she was found dead in a hotel room in the French capital in 2009.

Mr Griffin has been protesting his innocence in court, claiming Polish-born Ms Legg died by accident after she tried to  jump on him and ended up injuring her head when he kicked her off.

But Jane Carrigan, a friend of Ms Legg’s, told Paris Assizes: ‘On one occasion Kinga phoned me to say she has been badly beaten by Ian, and was in the bath trying to recover.’

‘She told me that he had driven his Mercedes through the front door of the house, then he beat her and left. This was approximately one month prior to her death.

‘I was so worried about her, I asked her to contact the police and an ambulance to see what state she was in, because the next time she may be dead. She said no. The next thing I heard, she was dead.’

Griffin had caused £30,000-worth of damage to Ms Legg’s  house in Oxshott but he eventually moved in with her

Ms Legg’s lifeless body was covered in almost 100 bruises, and she had a fatal head injury, when it was found in the bath of the £1000 room in the Bristol Hotel in May 2009.

When Griffin found Ms Legg's body, he said he didn't realise she was dead at first, and put her in a bath to warm up while he placed a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door and cleaned the room

Mr Griffin, 45, drove his car into the front door of Ms Legg's £3million home  in Oxshott, Surrey, just weeks before she was found dead in a hotel room in the French capital in 2009

Ms Carrigan, who was with Ms Legg when she first met Griffin in a Cheshire wine bar in the 1990s, said her friend was unlikely to have attacked anyone.

‘Kinga was not aggressive. In all the years I’ve known her, I’ve never seen her hurt anyone. She was one of the kindest, most generous people I have ever met.’

Ms Carrigan said Griffin was drinking up to three bottles of wine a day and she had seen Legg give him £20,000 to spend, and a credit card.

Guillaume Trayard, the barrister representing Ms Legg’s Polish family, said: ‘Did this love she had for Griffin place her under his power and grip?’, and Ms Carrigan replied: ‘Yes’.

In turn, Griffin told the court he was sleeping with other women, and Ms Legg became abusive on drink and medication.

‘Kinga would drink at nine o’clock in the morning,’ said Griffin. ‘In our lives, Kinga would open a bottle of champagne at any time of the morning.’

Asked why he hadn’t left Ms Legg following earlier fights, Griffin said: ‘When you love somebody, and get on really well, and some of it was my fault, you don’t.’

Referring back to his regularly physical arguments with Ms Legg, Griffin said: ‘Kinga would throw herself on top of me, and I would kick back with my feet.

‘If Kinga jumped on me, I kicked out and she would land on her back, that would always happen.

‘It would always start when she ran at me, and I would kick her off. I’m only going on history, I don’t know what happened on the night. Historically, she would fall back on the table or on to a TV.’ 

Griffin says he argued with Ms Legg in the bedroom of the five-star Bristol Hotel, Paris (pictured), but blacked out. When he woke he claims he found blood on the sheets, but had no memory of attacking Ms Legg

The prosecutor, Philippe Courroye, interjected at this point and, holding up a picture of Kinga’s dead body lying in the smashed up hotel room, said: ‘This isn’t history, she died from trauma to the head.’

Mr Courroye also asked Griffin to explain how Ms Legg ended up with so many defensive wounds, and Griffin said: ‘I can’t tell you. I don’t know if they were her jumping on me, or me jumping on her. I can’t remember’.

Griffin, a former rugby player, is 6ft1in, and weighs more than 14 stone. He said Ms Legg was 5ft8ins, and weighed eight, but said she was ‘incredibly strong, she had a six pack because she took slimming tablets and was very sporty’.

Asked why he had begun cleaning up the room when he woke up, rather than attending to Ms Legg’s dead body, Griffin said: ‘It’s hard to people to understand. It sounds stupid but all I focused on was the cleaning of the room.

‘I thought “Oh My God, there’s blood on the floor” but that was why I was so desperate. I didn’t know what to do.’

Ms Legg was later found floating in the bathtub of the couple's £1,000-a-night room with almost 100 bruises covering her body (file picture)

Griffin said Ms Legg was used to attacking lovers, explaining: ‘Kinga did it to her last boyfriend. I’m not the only one. I realise things went too far, for too long. I’m terribly sorry, but it wasn’t me. Kinga was angry because I was leaving her.’

The prosecutor, Mr Courroye, again held up pictures of the Bristol room, saying: ‘She did this alone?’

Griffin replied; ‘No, but we were getting married. She was the most important person to me. I wouldn’t have done this.’

Ms Legg wrote an email in April 2009, a month before her death, accusing Griffin of being the violent one, saying: ‘I never had anyone who beat me, who threw me down on the ground, I’m afraid.’

Griffin insists his memory had blacked out when the couple return to their room at the Bristol following an argument in a restaurant about his poor sex drive, and he only recovered it after her death.

He said he first met Ms Legg in a Cheshire wine bar ‘around 20 years ago’, and then the couple renewed their relationship in Sandbanks, Bournemouth, in 2008.

At the time of the death, they had been dating for 12 months, and lived together in Ms Legg’s mansion.

Griffin said: ‘We were like twins, we worked together, we had a fantastic time 95 per cent of the time.

‘She was somebody I just wanted to be with. When you meet someone who is special and makes you feel alive, you just want to be with her, but there were problems.’

Griffin’s trial is expected to end on Friday.
