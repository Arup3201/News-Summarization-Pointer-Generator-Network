A mom is facing assault charges after nearly pulling off her six-year-old son's genitals during a rage and then trying to repair his wound with superglue.

Jennifer Marie Vargas, 34, is a civilian living at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, where the boy's father is in the Army.

She was arrested on Wednesday and has been charged by the FBI with assault within maritime and territorial jurisdiction resulting in serious bodily injury.Â 

Jennifer Marie Vargas, 34, is facing assault charges after nearly pulling off her six-year-old son's genitals during a rage and then trying to repair his wound with superglue

Vargas remains in custody pending a bail hearing on Monday in federal court in San Antonio and faces up to 10 years in prison.

The incident happened on Sept. 27 at the family's home at the military base.

Prosecutors say the father returned home from work and found his injured son crying in his bedroom.

The father noticed bloody tissue in the boy's underwear and the severe injury to his scrotum.

He took his son to the San Antonio Military Medical Center, where doctors found that the boy had a four centimeters long laceration to his scrotum and bruising to his penis area.

'Due to the child's extreme physical pain, the medical staff had to administer medication,' the affidavit said, reports the Houston Chronicle.

'The child was taken into surgery to repair the damage to his scrotum.'

The boy is currently recovering from surgery and remains in his father's custody.

Vargas, the affidavit said, admitted to agents that while angry with the boy she grabbed him by the scrotum and pulled him to her as hard as she could, 'thereby ripping his "sack" and causing a laceration.'

Vargas told FBI agents that she cleaned the wound with alcohol and then tried to fix it with superglue.

'She applied superglue to the (boy's) scrotum until the bleeding stopped, stuffed his underwear with paper towels, and then told him to go to bed,' the affidavit said.

'Vargas did not seek any type of medical treatment for the child.'

Vargas was not charged until now because the matter still was under investigation. She is currently being detained with bond and at Monday's bail hearing prosecutors will argue that she continue to remain jailed.

Federal investigators are looking at previous states where the couple have lived to see if there have been any prior interactions with child protection agencies, but the CPS said it hasn't dealt with the family before.
