Two multi-millionaire internet entrepreneurs who bought a derelict Devon pub have finally met the villagers - and bought them all a pint.

Michael and Xochi Birch made £370 million when they sold Bebo, an early social network, the website to AOL in 2008. 

The Californian-based couple have now snapped up the the Farmers Arms pub in Woolsery, Devon, and have vowed to restore it to its former glory. 

At a meeting to explain their plans for the watering hole the husband and wife greeted locals with free wine and beer.

The crumbling Farmers Arms public house in Woolsery, Devon, has been snapped up by the Bebo entrepreneurs

Michael and Xochi Birch made £370 million when they sold Bebo to AOL in 2008. They have since bought it back for $1 million for 'fun'

A total of 200 locals attended the meeting at the village hall to hear Michael Birch discuss his plans for the derelict pub

One local who attended the meeting (pictured) said 'When we heard the news that Michael had bought the pub it was like all our Christmases had come at once'

Mr Birch hired the community hall and invited all 1,200 residents of the village to hear his ideas for the crumbling public house.

The 44-year-old, who was born in Cheshunt, Hertforshire,  has a family history in Woolsery dating back to the 1700s and considers it his 'spiritual home'.

The father-of-three recalled, with a pint in his hand, how he used to visit the pub on his many visits to the area.

'I have six generations of my family buried in the village church and I still have family living in the village today,' said the philanthropist, who named his son Devon.

'I have a huge emotional connection to the village and I have fond memories of drinking in The Farmers Arms and was saddened to hear that it had closed.'

The super wealthy couple have also bought the nearby Manor House Inn, which they will turn into a hotel

'I'm meeting with architects while I am here but it is still early days. I want to make sure I get everything right.'

Thirsty locals were left with a three-mile hike to the nearest pub after the Farmers Arms was shut in December 2012.

Its thatched roof was covered by a tarpaulin and villagers became worried about the safety of the building.

They managed to get the pub registered as an asset of community value in a bid to save it but that was reversed by Torridge District Council after the previous owners appealed.

Mr and Mrs Birch have also bought the nearby Manor House Inn, which has been unoccupied for eight years, which they will turn into a hotel.

Repairing both will cost more than £1million.

Job Andrew, Mr Birch's great-great grandfather, built Woolsery village shop, which remained in the family until it was sold in 1961.

His grandmother, Millicent Andrew, was born in the village shop's premises in 1900, and his grandfather Joseph Burrow was born at Ashcroft Farm.

Peter and Sonia Hamilton who founded the Woolsery Action Group in a bid to save The Farmers Arms were among 200 supporters who toasted the mogul's intervention.

Peter said: 'When we heard the news that Michael had bought the pub it was like all our Christmases had come at once.

'The closure of the village pub has had a detrimental effect on the village.'

The social networking website was launched in 2005.

Users could upload blogs, photos, music and videos to their pages.

Bebo, alongside MySpace was one of the contenders to Facebook in the early 2000s.

At its peak it had about 40 million users.

It was sold by Michael Birch to AOL for £370 million in 2008.

Bebo  was eclipsed by Facebook as well as other social networking sites such as Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr.

AOL's reluctance to invest in the site has been blamed for its decline.

Bebo sought bankruptcy protection in 2013 and Mr Birch  bought the company from its receivers for $1 million.

Sonia added: 'I hardly see anyone in the village now so we are all excited to get the pub back into the heart of the community.'

Ben Trevor, who just moved to the village five months ago said the purchase has created a real buzz.

He said: 'There's a great atmosphere in the village at the moment - it is such exciting news.'

Father-and-son, Gordon and Clive Leonard, owned and ran The Manor House from 1992 to 2002, were also in attendance.

Clive said: 'It's exciting to see what he has planned - the pub has been a great miss to the village.

'It's the best news the village could ever have had.'

Mr and Mrs Birch set up Bebo in 2005 with the social media website shorthand for 'Blog Early, Blog Often'.

It was a huge success and became one of the world's most popular websites with AOL buying it for $850 million three years later.

The couple made $600 million from the sale but then had to watch as the site crumbled due to poor management and the staggering growth of Facebook.

Last year they bought the site back for $1million 'for fun' to see if they could inject life into it.
