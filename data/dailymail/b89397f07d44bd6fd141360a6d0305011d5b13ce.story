At first glance, a cemetery on the grounds of a former boys’ reform school is nothing more than what it appears, marking graves of former students who died during influenza outbreaks and fires with simple metal crosses.

But now investigators believe that there may be more bodies near the site where 31 white crosses mark where bodies of students of the Florida School for Boys were laid to rest.

Though the school was shuttered last year and a 2009 investigation cleared the school of any criminal wrongdoing with the 31 unidentified boys, the bodies of up to 50 other students have not been accounted for.

House of horrors? The Dozier School for Boys was a reform school on Florida's panhandle with a possibly sinister past

Marked: Also on the campus are 31 marked graves, where victims of influenza and a fire in 1914 were laid to rest

Former students of the Dozier School for Boys, now aged 60 or older have told horror stories of how they were beaten as boys, in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.

Though a Florida State Investigation from 2009 concluded that the 31 graves on site held victims of the flu and those who died in a 1914 fire, the story the former students tell is much more sinister.

Anthropologist Erin Kimmerle, from the University of South Florida, is working with a team of experts to search the grounds, located on the Florida panhandle.

Dr Kimmerle told CNN that of 100 children who died while at the school, no burial records exist for 22 of the boys.

Some students, now long past boyhood, said of how boys at the institution were raped and beaten without mercy. They call the whitewashed cinder block shed where they were beaten the 'White House,' and call themselves the White House Boys.

Ovell Smith Krell, now 83, said that her brother, Owen Smith, was sent to the Dozier School for Boys in the spring of 1940, after running away from home and later stealing and wrecking a car.

According to a 2009 letter written by Mrs Krell, the family never heard from Owen again. She said that her mother wrote to the school to inquire about her son’s whereabouts, but was told Owen escaped.

The school then said he was caught and captured by the sheriff’s department. When their father came to claim his son, he was told that he was sent back to Dozier.

It is unclear what then happened to Owen. Mrs Krell said that she talked to a former student who said that he saw Owen being taken into what was known as the White House, a place where boys were disciplined on campus.

She wrote: ‘When they brought him out, they were carrying him. The boy said they heard his screams and that he was taken to the infirmary.’ 

Mrs Krell’s mother continued to write to the detention centre for months, until the school finally said that Owen’s badly decomposed body had been found under a house.

The school said that he had most likely died of pneumonia and was under the house to try to keep warm.

However, the doctor and lawyer living in the house told Mrs Krell that they never heard or smelled anything.

Mrs Krell told CNN that she hopes to give her brother the burial he deserves. ‘I would take him and put him down with my mom and dad in their cemetery,’ she explained.

‘I hope I get the chance.’
