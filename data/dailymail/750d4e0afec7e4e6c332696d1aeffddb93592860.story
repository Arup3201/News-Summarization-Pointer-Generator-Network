I've worked around politics and politicians for more than 25 years. And I thought I'd seen it all when it comes to political cynicism. Look at the long view and all the parties are as bad as each other, making promises they know can't be delivered or pledges they've no intention of honouring.

But in nearly three decades of following politics, for sheer shameless, dishonourable and downright nasty cynicism, nothing I've encountered comes close to Ed Miliband's promise yesterday that for anyone with suspected cancer, under a Labour Government they will be able to 'go to the GP and within a week you get both the test and the result'.

To read his interview, it was almost as if he was claiming a Miliband Government would be able to cure cancer in a week:

Criticised: Stephen Pollard says that in three decades of following politics, for sheer shameless, dishonourable and downright nasty cynicism, nothing he encountered comes close to Ed Miliband's cancer results promise

'One in three of us is going to get cancer during our lifetime – that's incredibly scary,' he said.

'It's a massive killer. The number of people waiting more than six weeks has doubled – we are talking about millions of people each year. This will make a big difference to patients.'

Except, of course, that the idea of a cancer test – any one test that can tell you 'yes' or 'no' – is utter nonsense.

It's not just a false hope that he is holding out; it's a shameful piece of political posturing designed solely to boost Labour's poll rating without any basis in medicine or reality.

We'll come to the specifics of his cynicism in a moment.

But here's my context. The reason the Labour leader's pledge so disgusts me is that it is personal.

Just under two years ago I was diagnosed with leukaemia. So, I know exactly what it means as a patient to be told that cancer is suspected, and then to have to go though the agonising waits involved.

Anyone who has cancer will tell you that it's not just one wait, it's several. And while the jaw-dropping inefficiency of the NHS certainly prolongs those waits, even in Mr Miliband's fantasy world where the NHS could do everything at the drop of a hat, waiting would be inevitable.

Because there is no one, single cancer test. There are many, of varying degrees of nastiness – just like cancers themselves.

Cynical: Ed Miliband has chosen to make the centrepiece of his campaign on the NHS, one of the core issues of the General Election, a pledge on cancer that is essentially nonsense, according to Stephen Pollard

My own diagnosis was both fortunate and farcical. As I have a form of arthritis, I have to have steroid injections. After one, my brilliant GP looked at the blood tests that were part of the procedure and sniffed that something wasn't quite right.

She sent me to a haematologist, who in turn sent me off to have a series of further blood tests. Looking back, I now think it's funny that she had the worst bedside manner imaginable.

I saw her again when the results came back from the lab, and without looking up from her notes she uttered a sentence I will never forget: 'The tests show that you have either the after-effects of a virus or a form of leukaemia.'

With hindsight, I was clearly an idiot because throughout the process to date the C-word never crossed my mind.

I had been feeling run down and tired for years but thought it nothing other than the result of working long hours and having two toddlers. So when she said 'leukaemia' I was poleaxed.

I needed more blood tests after some time had passed to see if a diagnosis was possible. Then, after these came through, she gave me the news: it was indeed 'a form of leukaemia' and I needed to see a consultant.

When I saw him, he ordered yet another round of blood tests. So much for Mr Miliband's idea of one test.

When these results came through, I was told I needed to have a sample of blood and bone scraped from my spine.

I will spare you the full details. Suffice to say that no local anaesthetic is possible at the immediate place of incision, so the pain is, well, serious.

The surgeon told me they only ever make two attempts to do the procedure in one session because it is so painful.

Even if there was one overall cancer test that could be delivered within a week, it would be pointless without an NHS able to deliver the right care 

They made an exception in my case – the house doctor was so incompetent that after five attempts she had still not got what was needed, before finally consenting to get the registrar. On his first go (and my sixth) he managed it perfectly.

Then, finally, after four blood tests and a bungled procedure, the consultant was able to give me a full diagnosis, a month after my GP's initial concern.

Even if the bone test had been carried out flawlessly, the process could not have been anything other than drawn out and ambiguous.

And for good measure, when the consultant then tried to see when my leukaemia had actually developed by looking at the records of four previous operations I'd had over the past decade, not one of the four different hospitals – not one – could lay their hands on records they were supposed to have kept.

So no one has any idea if I've had leukaemia for two years or 20. Seven days to find out if we have cancer, Mr Miliband? What disgusting cynicism.

It is possible, I concede, that I am doing the Labour leader a disservice. Perhaps he doesn't actually know that this is how cancer diagnosis really happens, and that he's not being deliberately cynical. Perhaps, in other words, he's just being an idiot.

Not exactly a comforting thought about a man who could be Prime Minister next year, is it? But given his track record, I've no doubt that it's naked cynicism. In July, Mr Miliband gave a little-noticed speech about political cynicism.

According to him, what really threatens to stop Labour winning next year isn't the Conservatives – it's cynicism.

He said: 'The belief that nobody can make a difference. That all politics is the same…They believe we value posturing more than principle. Good photos or soundbites more than a decent policy. Image more than ideas.'

Ignore the breathtaking hypocrisy of such a speech from a man whose most stupid mistake so far was to forget to talk about the deficit in his party conference speech – a mistake that happened because he cared so much about his image that he chose to speak without any notes.

Just think about this weekend's announcement in that context.

Mr Miliband has chosen to make the centrepiece of his campaign on the NHS, one of the core issues of the General Election, a pledge on cancer that is essentially nonsense – based neither on medical reality nor patient need.

Even if there was one overall cancer test that could be delivered within a week, it would be pointless without an NHS able to deliver the right care.

But instead of focusing on a decent policy, as he put it in that speech, he is the one who is focused on posturing more than principle.

Here's the cynicism. Labour has a 12-point lead over the Tories on the NHS – and Mr Miliband will do anything he can to keep the issue alive as one of the key battlegrounds of the General Election.

Even if it means making cynical promises that leave this cancer patient simply nauseated.
