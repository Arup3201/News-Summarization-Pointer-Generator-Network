Stephen Lindop, 35, from Denton, Greater Manchester, stole from pubs and cafes and pretended his handyman father was a millionaire

A pub manager who claimed a 'struggle with his sexuality' led to him to pose as a wealthy playboy and go on giant spending sprees was jailed today after admitting theft and fraud.

Stephen Lindop, 35, from Denton, Greater Manchester, stole tens of thousands of pounds in cash from a string of employers and used some of the money to fund a luxury lifestyle he could not afford, a court heard.

He enjoyed stays at the Dorchester Hotel in London, handed out £100 tips to taxi drivers, went on shopping sprees and treated friends to champagne-fuelled nights at nightclubs. 

Today Lindop, who told people who asked that his handyman father was a millionaire, was jailed for three years after admitting theft and fraud. 

The fraudster, who was said to have lived in a Walter Mitty-style 'fantasy world', got his first job running a pub in Bristol in 2008 after falsifying his CV.

Within four months the owner was forced to sell the pub and two other establishments after a number of 'ridiculously high' refunds were taken from the tills, many of them outside opening hours.

On a day when almost £2,000 was actually taken in sales, the till records said no money had been taken at all as Lindop and a colleague carried out multiple refunds and 'void' transactions.

Thousands in fees and deposits for party bookings were taken but not banked, the court was told.

Staff wages were regularly paid from the till, the pub's food and drink was consumed, and numerous takeaways and complimentary meals drained its coffers. 

In December 2010 Lindop was sentenced to 24 months in prison, suspended for two years, and was ordered to pay £10,000 compensation for fraud.

But later that month he registered with Berkeley Scott employment agency in Manchester, saying he had no convictions.

He also omitted from his CV all mention of employment at the pub in Bristol, and was taken on as manager of the Forum café in Wythenshawe in January 2011.

When the café decided to install a cashpoint machine to attract extra custom Lindop, who was given access to it, stole £63,380 from it at a rate of around £2,000 a week. 

Prosecutor Henry Blackshaw said: 'He was the only person trusted with the keys and as such could enter the machine to replenish money cassettes which held £10 and £20 notes.

The court heard concerns were not raised until the company's financial manager returned from sick leave and, during a site visit, it was found the machine only had £470.

Lindop was suspended and later sacked, and subsequently admitted he used his friend as a reference. 

But he denied stealing and named other employees who could be responsible, which meant he was free to get another job, this time managing drink vending machines.

Lindop stole £4785 from them over a four-month period between March and July 2012, the court was told.

His barrister said that despite Lindop's history, he had been employed at Kellogg's as a £26,000 a year head chef for two years.

Hunter Gray said: 'He is someone who has good qualifications and is good at his job but has resorted to this blatant theft and dishonesty. He is from a very good background and his parents are horrified.

'He points to his own difficulties in dealing with his sexuality throughout his 20s, becoming a person he didn't really like, lacking confidence, and he accepts he began to steal to fund a lifestyle he couldn't afford to surround himself with people who were better than him...

'Over the last two years he has finally opened up to who he is. He states his offending is behind him and how ashamed he is and deeply remorseful.'

Sentencing, the judge Mr Recorder Mark Ainsworth said: 'It was two weeks after your sentence in Bristol that you put your name down with an employment agency in Manchester but failed to tell them, despite expressed requirements, that you had previous convictions. 

'The degree of trust was significant.'
