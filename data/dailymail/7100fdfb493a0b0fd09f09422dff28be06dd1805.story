The 23-year-old surfer who lost parts of both arms after he was reportedly mauled by two sharks in Western Australia is a keen surfer and football player who was due to play in his football team's grand final this weekend.

Mr Pollard, who is from the WA town of Bunbury, was attacked about 11am on Thursday at Kelpids Beach, in Wylie Bay, an isolated stretch of sand near Esperance on the state's far southeast coast.

The South Bunbury Football Club paid tribute to Mr Pollard in a Facebook post and pledged their support for their club member and his family.

Two Great White sharks have been caught and killed by the WA Department of Fisheries, although a spokeswoman wasn't able to confirm whether the shark was responsible for the attack.

But according to ABC TV, the person who spoke to Mr Pollard immediately after the attack said he believed he had been mauled by two bronze whalers, who described the attack as a 'feeding frenzy'.

Mr Heasman said he did not know whether the man was a holidaymaker or was working in Esperance.

'I know his girlfriend is in Esperance but I'm not sure if she witnessed the event as well,' he said.

A spokeswoman for the WA Department of Fisheries said a white shark has been caught near Wylie Bay, at Kelpids Beach, about six kilometres from Esperance 

All beaches were closed at Wylie Bay and are likely to remain closed for the next few days

South Bunbury Football Club wrote a post on Facebook a few hours after the incident on Thursday afternoon

A spokeswoman for the WA Department of Fisheries said the first white shark was caught near Wylie Bay, at Kelpids Beach, about six kilometres from Esperance. 

'Department of Fisheries' officers deployed capture gear within the vicinity of the incident, and later captured a while shark, between 3 and 4.5 metres in size,' she said.

The spokeswoman said the department has not yet confirmed whether the sharks are responsible for the attack, however it has been killed and retained for examination.

'The Commonwealth granted an exemption for the deployment of fishing gear to catch a shark posing a threat,' she said. 

'Arrangements will be made to retain the shark for research purposes and for further examination by the department's experts.'

A second large white shark, about three metres in length, has also been caught and killed.

'Even upon examination it may not be possible to confirm that either shark was involved in the incident this morning,' the spokeswoman said.

All beaches were closed at Wylie Bay and are likely to remain closed for the next few days, the spokeswoman said.

'(The department) urges local people and holiday makers to stay out of the water,' she said. 

Premier Colin Barnett's initial response to the attack was saying a shark being in the area during school holidays posed a significant threat to public safety.

He said because it was an unpatrolled beach, his government's newly scrapped drumline policy would not have been applicable.

'That said, today's attack is an unfortunate and tragic reminder of how serious the threat is,' Mr Barnett said.

In recent weeks, Surf Lifesaving WA has tweeted reports of shark sightings near Wylie Bay. 

A white shark was spotted 50m offshore on September 20 around 5pm. And on September 21, a four metre shark was seen at West Beach Dalyup, near Esperance, about 11am.

Great Whites are common to the Western Australia coastline, which has witnessed a spate of attacks, some of them fatal, in recent years.

Survivor: Greg Pickering, an abalone diver, was attacked by a great white around 180km east of Esperance last year

Victim: Chris Boyd (right) was killed by a shark on the state's south coast November 2013. 

Boyd (left), 35, was surfing off Gracetown at the time of the attack.

Shark cull: This tiger shark was caught in the Margaret River region, WA, as part of the state government's controversial 'catch and kill' program in February. 

Surfer Chris Boyd, 35, was killed in the waters off Gracetown, on the state's south coast, in November last year. 

In January 2006, bodysurfer Zak Golebiowski lost a leg when when he was savaged by a great white at Whyton Beach, 60km away from where today's attack occurred. 

Last October, abalone diver Greg Pickering was attacked by a great white shark while swimming off a remote beach around 180km east of Esperance.

Mr Pickering survived bites to the head and neck but required more than 10 hours of surgery.

The Barnett Government recently introduced a controversial 'shark-culling' program following the attacks.

The program involves baited drum lines being suspended from floating oil drums in an effort to distract sharks from beaches.  

Catch: A male tiger shark is slaughtered at Moses Rock, off the West Australian coast.
