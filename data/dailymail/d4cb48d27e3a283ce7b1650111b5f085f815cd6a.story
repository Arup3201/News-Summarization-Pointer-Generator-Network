When Hornby secured a deal to produce official London 2012 merchandise it was lauded as a major coup for the iconic British toymaker, which hoped it would provide a much-needed boost to profits.

But the spectacular success of this summer's 'Golden Games' didn't rub off on the manufacturer after bizarre Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville failed to impress a baffled public.

Shares in Hornby plummeted by more than a third after it was forced to issue a profits warning on the back of poor sales of its Olympic merchandise, and the firm has now slashed prices by up to 85 per cent in an attempt to shift the unpopular souvenirs.

'Disappointing': Hornby shares have struggled over the past year

Based upon blobs of steel and 
featuring a single eye each, less-than-cuddly mascots Wenlock and 
Mandeville were designed to symbolise the 2012 Games with their Olympic 
Ring-inspired friendship bracelets, and featured a nod to the capital in
the form of London 'taxi lights' on their heads.

But
the public failed to warm to the strange figures and a whole of host of unsold
Wenlock and Mandeville branded souvenirs and collectibles are now gathering dust on 
toyshop shelves.

Hornby has knocked £96 off the price of a 12-pack of London 2012 die-cast Wenlock or Mandeville figurines, which are now on sale for £23.88, while many single figurines - originally priced £9.99 - are now selling for £2.99.

The toy firm, which is behind Scalextric and Corgi and also makes model railways, had hoped sales of Olympic merchandise would see a boom in profits, but admitted that demand for London 2012 products had been disappointing.

It said that, while early demand for Games-related goods had been encouraging, major retailers had also purchased 'substantial quantities' of 2012 merchandise from other licensees.

When the anticipated sales rush failed to materialise, the big retailers introduced deep discounts on the products.

'The consequence of this for Hornby was that retailers lost confidence in many categories of London 2012 merchandise, and repeat orders for our products were cancelled,' the company said.

Hornby's shares slumped 37 per cent or 32.37p to 56.13p after it issued the profits warning - its third this year - yesterday.

Shares had risen to 62.13p today.

The toymaker, which has also suffered from major disruption at one of its largest suppliers in China, said it is now expecting to only break even in the current financial year.

Last year it made profits of £4.5million.

Reduced: Hornby has slashed prices on souvenirs including this Cadbury chocolate machine which is down from £9.99 to £3.99

Poor sales: 'Destination London 2012' model black cabs, originally £4.99, are now £2.49

Souvenirs: Hornby has knocked £15 off the price of this hand-finished London 2012 showjumping figurine - it is now selling for just £4.99

Demand: This London 2012 train pack is now out of stock after being reduced by £30 to £119.99

Olympic-inspired: Hornby's Scalextric Team GB Track Cycling Velodrome set is still full price at £69.99

Poor Olympic sales have led Hornby to introduce significant reductions on everything from Wenlock and Mandeville figurines to Destination London 2012 Taxis - now priced £2.49.

But a London 2012 branded train set was still selling on the website for the full price of £99.99, as was the Scalextric Team GB Track Cycling Velodrome kit, suggesting the firm is banking on more robust demand for at least some of the merchandise.

Hornby said it would be 'constrained significantly' in the current financial year, but would keep a tight lid on costs and had "redoubled efforts" in product development and innovation in order to turn sales around.

The firm had put its hopes in Olympics fever to help revive flagging UK sales, which fell four per cent in the last financial year. Trading was stronger in Continental Europe and North America, which helped wider group profits rise slightly from £4.4 million to £4.5 million.

Hornby was one of 65 licensees that were awarded rights to sell official London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic products.

Wenlock and Mandeville were created by London-based creative agency Iris, which said the mascots had been designed to appeal to children.

Unveiled in the lead up to London 2012, the duo were given their own individual Twitter and Facebook accounts, with Iris claiming they would 'come to life in the digital space'.

But despite their symbolic meaning - and an elaborate 'back story' penned by children's author Michael Morpurgo - the creations were largely panned by the public.

The much-criticised mascots attracted further controversy ahead of the Games when it emerged that school were being charged a fee of £850 for a visit from actors dressed as Wenlock and Mandeville.

Schools could pay the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games £600 for one of the mascots to attend a community event or multi-school sports day, or £850 for both.

Critics pointed out that the mascots had been created to 'connect young people with sport', but claimed the sizeable fee meant only the richest schools would be able to welcome Wenlock and Mandeville.

At the time LOCOG insisted schools interested in a visit from the mascots were being charged at cost price.
