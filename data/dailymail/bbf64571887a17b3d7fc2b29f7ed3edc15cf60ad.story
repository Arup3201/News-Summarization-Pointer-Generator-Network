From the frescoes of Ancient Greece to 21st Century spam e-mails, it seems penis size has been an issue since the dawn of man.

But a new study has questioned the assumption that size is king - by finding a group of women were more likely to cheat on men with larger penises.

The research questioned 545 fishermen's wives in Kenya, of which just 34 admitted they had affairs.

Is size still king? A study of fishermen found those with larger penises were more likely to be cheated on

The male fishermen who had been cheated on were better-endowed than those whose wives did not have affairs, the researchers said.

The better-endowed husbands had fully erect penises of around six inches, while whose whose wives were faithful had erect penises of around five inches.

The report's authors wrote: 'Surprisingly, spouse longer fully erect penis was associated with increased likelihood of the women having extra-marital partnerships.

'From these results, every one inch longer penis increased the likelihood of women being involved in extra-marital partnership by almost one-and-half times.

'Similarly, our qualitative data also support this finding. Women associated large penises with pain and discomfort during sex which precludes the enjoyment and sexual satisfaction that women are supposed to feel.'

Researchers followed up the figures by conducting interviews with the women.

Happy couple: There was an upside, however, as just 34 women out of the 545 said they had cheated

One said: 'It hurts so much that I will have to look for another man.'

The joint study was published in the journal PLOS ONE by scientists from the Center for Microbiology Research in Kisumu, Kenya; Kenyatta University in the capital Nairobi; the University of California and University of Alabama.

The aim was to discover more about the way partners have affairs to reduce the spread of HIV. The study also found younger women were more likely to cheat on their partners.

Participants were asked to take the measurements themselves using a 15-inch ruler.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers had to take an average between the lengths the fishermen claimed they had obtained and those submitted by their wives.

There were 'discrepancies' between the two, the authors wrote.
