So Diego Costa stamped on Emre Can. And it was probably deliberate. And he might get charged and banned and it fits with the image of his snarling style, as the centrepiece of a compelling and aggressive Capital One Cup semi-final.

Michael Oliver, the referee, missed it, apparently. Cue an explosion of outrage and opinion in support of increasing the use of technology in a HD world where a zillion television cameras scrutinise every move from every angle and everyone’s an expert.

And yet the very reason this tie was so exciting and memorable, played at breath-taking speed, with great commitment was down to the fact it was allowed to flow by a referee who tried to keep 22 players on the field. Is that necessarily bad refereeing?

Diego Costa may still be charged for his apparent stamp on Emre Can

Costa also appeared to stamp on Martin Skrtel after skipping over a challenge in the second half

Oliver did well to keep control of what proved to be a fiery and passionate game

Oliver helped the spectacle. Sure, he was lenient. He might have sent off Costa, more than once. He might have given him a penalty. He might have sent off Lucas Leiva. Or Martin Skrtel. Or Jordan Henderson, for that matter, although this current fixation of passing judgment on what is ball-to-hand or hand-to-ball is simply ridiculous. Arms move when people move. The ball bounces.

If football is going to be refereed in super slow-motion by officials sat in a glass box in the stands leafing through imperfect rule-books, then let’s forget thrilling football matches like the one at Stamford Bridge.

Let’s forget those who tackle for a living. Or those who thrive on physical contact, who exist on the edge and push the rules; those who inspire and lead others with their desire to succeed. Let’s bid farewell to the relentless pace of the game and those brilliant technicians who can perform with a football in the heat of these fierce contests.

Those like Eden Hazard, who produced a fabulous display despite the fact that Emre Can’s first reaction almost every time Hazard received the ball was to grab for him with his hands. Or Raheem Sterling taking on the muscle of Kurt Zouma and John Terry with his pace and trickery.

Also, while we’re at it, draw a line under the debate and the dissent which fuels the passion which stirs the blood and generates a fantastic atmosphere, even in the modern venues built for corporate dining.

Of course, let’s strive for fairness. Let’s stop violence and intimidation. Let’s send off those who don’t deserve to stay on. But don’t sterilise these matches. These are what made the sport the world’s favourite.

If football has become too important to let mistakes to slip by then the game is in trouble. There is too much money at stake to allow imperfections. Whose fault is that? Do not change the best game in the world for the sake of money by killing the tempo with slow-motion investigations.

Diego Costa stamped on Emre Can. It probably hurt. And it looked deliberate. And he might get charged and banned but only one person truly knows whether it was a pre-meditated attack, an opportunistic strike or a complete accident.

Let money take its chance. Let the referees do their best. Relax and enjoy the game. What a game that was.

His decision not too, however, allowed the game to be free-flowing
