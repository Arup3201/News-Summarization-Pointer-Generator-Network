Backpacking has moved on from  dusty triple bunks, leaking pipes and rattling stairways.

The glacier village of Saas Fee in Switzerland recently played host to the  opening of the world's first youth hostel with a private spa and swimming pool.

Starting this month the wellnessHostel4000 offers weary travellers the chance to unwind and indulge in some mountaintop pampering.

Sauna with a view: wellnessHostel4000   is the first hostel in the world to offer guests private spa

The spa features two saunas, a herbal steam bath, whirlpool, footbath, 'navel stone', hydromassage showers with settings such as 'summer rain', 'freezing fog', 'mountain stream' and 'waterfall', a relaxation room and an 'extensive' massage programme.

And the well-equipped hostel also includes a 25-metre indoor pool, a children's pool, waterslide and fitness centre.

Die-hard travellers can share a dorm of up to six people and enjoy the views from up high in the beautiful Swiss mountains for around 35 Euros (£28) while a private double room costs around 130 Euros (£102) per night.

The hostel has 168 beds and is one of the first five-storey hotels to be built in Switzerland using timber construction.

It reinterprets local barn style architecture and uses an eco-friendly solar heating system.

It is surrounded by 13 four-thousand metre peaks including the Strahl-horn, Rimpfishcorn, Allalin and Feekopf and lies at the foot of the Dom, the third highest mountain in the Alps. 

To say it's picturesque  is like saying Swiss actress Ursula Andress was average looking.

The hostel has 45 kilometres of pistes, freestyle parks and halfpipes gladden the hearts of snow sport professionals even in summer, because Saas-Fee is the summer skiing area. 

As well as skiing, there are three bike routes, hiking and climbing regions as well as guided high-Alpine tours.

Night life includes plenty of bars, clubs and après-ski pubs.
