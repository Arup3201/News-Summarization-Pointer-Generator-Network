Many of us would find looking round our great-great-great-grandmother's house a bit of a drag - if she wasn't Queen Victoria.

Prince Edward has returned to a modest cottage which the monarch used to teach her nine children about 'normal' life, including cooking, growing vegetables and selling the spoils at market prices (albeit to Prince Albert).

The Swiss chalet at Osborne House, Queen Victoria's private home on the Isle of Wight, was where her children spent up to five months a year catching butterflies, having tea parties and operating a steam engine.

Family heirlooms: Prince Edward and Sophie Countess of Wessex have visited Osborne House, Queen Victoria's favourite getaway for herself and her nine children on the Isle of Wight and overlooking the Solent. The sprawling estate hosts a new exhibition on life in a small chalet where the queen's children learned about 'normal' life

Normal life: The Queen would leave her nine children to their own devices in this Swiss chalet, which has been the focus of a £1.7m conservation and history project by English Heritage and hosts a new exhibition on what life may have been like as a Royal child.

'Looks normal to me!' Many people would find looking around their great-great-great-grandmother's cottage a boring task, but not so for Prince Edward

The Earl and Countess of Wessex visited today after English Heritage finished a £1.7million conservation project at the cottage.

Almost a mile out of sight of the grand home, secreted away near Queen Victoria's private beach, the children would be left to their own devices there for days on end.

It was built for them in 1854 and joined only by the caretakers Mr and Mrs Warne, plus occasionally their governesses, they used it to learn skills used by people up and down Victorian Britain - not that they would ever need them.

Project historian Andrew Hann told MailOnline: 'The children, particularly the girls, did a lot of cooking - they cooked cakes and biscuits and other treats which were then served to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

'They also did gardening and grew maize, carrots and all the things you would expect.

'Their vegetable patches were arranged by age, with Princess Victoria's at the far left and Princess Beatrice's at the far right. They were all exactly the same size and Prince Albert would buy the vegetables back off them at market prices to teach them the value of money.

Humble: The timber chalet may be impeccably-finished but it was modest by Royal standards, with space only for the live-in caretakers and the children

Not your average summer house: Prince Edward and Sophie leave the Swiss chalet today after re-opening it following a £1.7million project by English Heritage

Not quite an Alpine view, but still pretty: The cottage is near the coast of the Isle of Wight and Queen Victoria's private beach, which looked out over the Solent

'He had been raised in Germany with a Swiss chalet, and wanted to repeat his childhood for his children. It was all Albert's idea to make them more competitive.

'We found one occasion in the children's letters where Prince Alfred was demonstrating a steam engine and it drenched Bertie's face with water. On another, Princess Helena discovered how scared she was of wasps.'

A new children's exhibition on life as a Royal child, which forms part of the conservation project, is based on numerous letters by the children which they wrote while staying in the cottage.

The Childhood at Osborne exhibition also draws on Queen Victoria's detailed daily journals, stored in the Royal archives at Windsor Castle.

Today the Earl and Countess followed in the footsteps of their ancestors by meeting staff, historians and fundraisers at the cottage and main home on the sprawling 342-acre estate.

Mr Hann said: 'They were very engaged with the whole exhibition and were asking lots of questions. It's their family history, after all.'

Grand: The Royals were shown round the main house on the Isle of Wight, which was gifted to the public by Edward VII in 1902 when he decided he didn't want it

The estate was gifted to the nation by Edward VII on his coronation day in 1902 when he decided he didn't want it, and was later used to house a Naval college before being opened fully to the public.

But Victoria and Albert's most private rooms were sealed for more than 50 years on the orders of Edward VII, only being unlocked with the permission of Elizabeth II in 1954.

Queen Victoria bought the estate in 1845 claiming it was 'impossible to imagine a prettier spot', and her new husband had a new house designed by London's Master Builder of the age Thomas Cubitt.

She would spend days on end looking across the Solent to Portsmouth from her private beach, which was where she swam for the first time.

Despite the privacy of the huge estate, the famously conservative monarch used a curious 'bathing machine' which concealed her entirely behind a set of curtains while she swam in the sea.

Family home: Filled with gold leaf, marble, chandeliers and valuable rugs, the house still contains many of the features which it had during the reign of Queen Victoria

It's like one I have at home! Not all country houses have full-size marble statues inside as well as out, but Osborne was home to Victoria for several months a year

The contraption, containing a plumbed toilet and a changing room, was run to the shore along the beach on a long ramp, and pulled back in using a wire rope and winch.

When the queen had finished changing and got into the water, a veranda on the machine would have curtains drawn across it so those on the shore could not see her.

She wrote in her journal on 30 July 1847:  'Drove to the beach with my maids and went in the bathing machine, where I undressed and bathed in the sea (for the 1st time in my life).

'I thought it delightful till I put my head under water, when I thought I should be stifled.'
