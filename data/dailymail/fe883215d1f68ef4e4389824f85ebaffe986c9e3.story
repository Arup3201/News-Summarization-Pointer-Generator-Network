A man has been arrested in connection with a stream of violent abuse directed at an MP and a feminist activist on Twitter.

Labour MP Stella Creasy, 36, and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, 29, have both been the target of abusive online 'trolling'.

Scotland Yard today confirmed a 32-year-old man was arrested in Bristol in connection with menacing tweets sent to the two women.

Police said the suspected Twitter troll, who has not been named by police, would be questioned at a station in Bristol on suspicion of committing an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act.

At the weekend Miss Creasy was sent a horrifying image of a masked man wielding a knife on Twitter by an internet troll, who warned her: 'I'm gonna be the first thing you see when you wake up'.

The Twitter user who sent the image, under the handle @Murkztah, was suspended from the site and reported to police.

Ms Criado-Perez received rape threats over Twitter after she campaigned for a woman to be featured on British bank notes.

Miss Creasy was targeted by abusers who 
threatened to attack her and called her a 'dumb blonde bitch' after she 
came out in support of the journalist.

A number of female journalists later came forward to report a series of rape and bomb threats.

They were allegedly sent to Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman, Independent writer Grace Dent and Europe editor of Time magazine Catherine Mayer.

Similar messages were also sent to Sara Lang, a social media manager at U.S. campaign group AARP.

Scotland Yard launched an investigation into allegations of online abuse and threats after the Walthamstow MP and others alerted police to vile messages they were being inundated with.

The man detained in Bristol this morning is the third person to be arrested in connection with the abuse.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Detectives from the Metropolitan Police
have this morning, 7 August, arrested a 32 year-old-man, on suspicion 
of committing an offence under the Protection of Harassment Act, 1997.

'He was arrested at an address in Bristol by officers from the 
Metropolitan Police Central eCrime Unit as part of an ongoing 
investigation into allegations relating to threats made on Twitter.

'He has been arrested in connection with allegations made to police by two women, who made reports to police on 25 and 29 July.'

Miss Creasy and TV historian Mary Beard both became the target of rape threats after they backed Ms Criado-Perez, who endured a torrent of abuse following herÂ  successful campaign to get author Jane Austen featured on a new bank note.

University of Cambridge professor Ms Beard, who received a message claiming a bomb had been planted outside her home, has urged police to distinguish between 'repeated threats of violence and death' made against women online and other internet abuse.

The stream of violent online threats have prompted calls for Twitter to beef up its security measures.

More than 120,000 people have now signed a petition calling on the site to introduce tighter controls to protect its users.

Twitter UK manager Tony Wang this week personally apologised to the women that had been targeted, declaring the abuse they received was 'simply not acceptable'.

Twitter has said it plans to make 
reporting abuse easier by bringing a 'report abuse' function already 
available on the iPhone app version of the micro-blogging site to other 
phones and platforms.
