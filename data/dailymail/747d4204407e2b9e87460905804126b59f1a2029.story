Emmanuel Adebayor was going through one of those unplayable phases around this time last year.

The goals were flying in - eight in 10 games through January and February – there was a smile on his face and an infectious spirit in his football, which even tempted Tim Sherwood to join him in a trademark salute celebration at White Hart Lane.

Sherwood, during six months at the helm, displayed great faith in Adebayor, showed him a little love and rescued him from the doldrums, where he often languishes, took advantage of the fact he wasn’t Andre Villas-Boas and the faith was repaid, with a total of 14 goals in 24 games.

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino insists he has a good relationship with Adebayor

Emmanuel Adebayor was given permission by Tottenham to return to Africa for personal reasons on December 10. 

His return came just weeks after Adebayor accused family members of doing Juju on him.

Read the full story HERE. 

AVB had frozen him out, infuriated by the striker’s attitude. Seldom can the fluctuations in form and focus of a player of his ability have been so extreme. When he’s good he’s very, very good and when he’s bad, he is utterly infuriating.

Nine years since he came to England, signed by Arsenal from Monaco, that has always been the way. Is he fit? Great, what sort of mood is he in? Where’s his head at?

Adebayor returned to the Tottenham team as a substitute in the 1-1 draw against Sunderland on Saturday. He was jeered on to the pitch by quite a few Spurs fans and contributed next to nothing after coming on.

Football supporters will tolerate plenty if they can see effort and commitment (see Roberto Soldado) but they are entitled to question those they feel are swinging the lead, especially if they happen to be the club’s top earner on £100,000 a week.

Since his last start, at Aston Villa, there have been vague but minor injuries and illnesses and he was given compassionate leave to visit Africa amid stories of witchcraft surrounding his family.

As ever, there have been few specifics from Pochettino, who has managed the situation with great care, saying as little as possible in public despite a barrage of questions.

Adebayor insists that his personal problems are behind him, that his head is in the right place once again. He is in the squad to face Sheffield United in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final and may even start his first game since November 2.

It is a shrewd move by Pochettino, who really could do with the sort of mid-season boost to his striking options that Adebayor provided last year. It would ease the burden on Harry Kane and relieve some of the pressure in the transfer market.

Sheffield United, from League One, have made a habit of surprising opponents from the Barclays Premier League in cup competitions over the last 18 months and will be backed by strong support from their travelling fans but Spurs, with only one defeat in 10, will expect to beat them.

Michel Vorm appears set to start in goal and Nacer Chadli is missing due to the death of his father Ramdan after a long illness but Pochettino is expected to select a strong team in the first of three cup ties in a week. If Adebayor does not start against the Blades, his chance may come against Leicester in the FA Cup on Saturday.

The 30-year-old Togo international, who has not scored since October and out of contract next year, is firmly back in the frame, with a final chance to rescue his Tottenham career by helping them towards Wembley. And he is quite capable of rising to the challenge.
