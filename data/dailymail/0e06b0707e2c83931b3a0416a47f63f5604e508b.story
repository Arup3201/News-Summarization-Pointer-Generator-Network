British Airways announced tough new security measures last night which will see passengers barred from US-bound flights if their electronic devices are not charged up.

In preventing passengers from flying, the airline is going one step further than the guidelines issued on Sunday. These stated that gadgets will be confiscated before boarding if their owner fails to switch them on and prove they are not packed with explosives.

The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has said it will not allow mobile phones – especially the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy – on to planes bound for the U.S. from some international airports if the devices are not charged.

But British Airways’ rules could see travellers with uncharged electronic devices – some of which are notorious for having short battery lives – not only lose their gadgets but also their seats on the flight.

Not taking any chances: British Airways is going one step beyond TSA's new security regulations and will kick passengers off U.S.-bound flights if they are found boarding with an uncharged electronic device

And unwitting passengers whose batteries have run out during a stop-over, before taking a connecting flight to the U.S., face being stranded, unable to continue their journey.

A spokesman from British Airways confirmed its new policy, telling MailOnline: ‘If [customers] are unable to power up their electronic device they will not be allowed to fly.

'If it does not power up then it cannot be placed in hand or hold luggage. We advise our customers to please do all they can to ensure that any electronic device they have is fully powered before you arrive at the airport.

‘For people transferring we advise that they use electronic devices sparingly if they are going to fly on a long journey before getting to London and then transferring on to a US destination.’

The airline also admitted that there will be limited charging facilities at check-in, so there is little chance of any last-minute powering up.

Still unclear is what will happen to the confiscated devices. Whether they will be returned to their owner or destroyed.

The heightened security comes amid reports two terror networks are working together on a bomb that could evade existing detection measures.

In addition to cellphones, U.S. officials are concerned that laptops, tablets, cameras, e-readers, music players and game consoles could be used to conceal a bomb carried by an operative of al-Qaeda.

'The danger with electronic devices is 
the ability to hide something metal, like a military or commercial 
detonator, which makes a bomb extremely reliable,' former ATF Special 
Agent in Charge Jim Cavanaugh told NBC News.

Even more concerning is the fact that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, aka ISIS), the extremist group currently taking control in Syria and northern Iraq, could be working in conjunction with Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

In 2009, AQAP's lead bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, built an underwear bomb used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane bound for Detroit.

Al-Asiri, 32, continues to work in Yemen which has U.S. officials worried, especially if he is working to supply one of the thousands of Westerners who have joined up with ISIS jihadists in the Middle East and could be carrying passports allowing easier travel.

The TSA did not disclose which airports would be conducting the additional screening, but industry data shows that more than 250 foreign airports offer nonstop service to the U.S.

London Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, may be the hardest hit with hundreds of outbound flights to the U.S. carrying thousands of passengers every day.

The airport issued a statement following the new regulations, advising passengers on U.S.-bound flights to make sure their electronic devices are charged before arriving at the airport for travel.

U.S. officials singled out particular smartphones, including the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy, for security screening on direct flights bound for the States from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

There's also concern that a hard-to-detect bomb could be built to hide in a shoe, an anonymous U.S. official told Reuters. That fear was intensified on Sunday when a man being screened at the Detroit airport was found concealing a knife in his sneaker.

For now the rules are only in place for U.S. bound flights at foreign airports, and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson refused to say whether the tough regulation could impact domestic flights soon.

'We continue to evaluate things,' he said on Meet the Press. 'In this instance we felt that it was important to crank it up some at the last point of departure airports and we'll continually evaluate the situation.'

The BA spokesman added: ‘Safety and security is our top priority at all times and we continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world.‘

'We are complying with the US regulations and would advise customers to arrive in good time for their flights both at check-in and also at the boarding gate ... our flights continue to operate as normal.’
