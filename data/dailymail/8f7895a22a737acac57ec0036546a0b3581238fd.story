When an elderly woman fell down an escalator at a bustling train station, you might have expected rail staff to rush to her aid.

But astonishingly, they refused to help her. And their reason? They had not been trained in ‘people-handling’.

The extraordinary excuse was given by Northern Rail workers, who stood just yards away and let other passengers tend to the shocked woman instead. A witness, who confronted the staff at Leeds train station, described their attitude as ‘shameful’.

Going up: Rail staff refused to help an elderly woman after she fell down an escalator at bustling Leeds station

Tom Lees, 25, said he was waiting for a train at around 10.30am when he spotted an ‘old lady fall backwards’ while travelling up an escalator. 

He said one passenger ‘grabbed her’ and another stopped the escalator by pressing an emergency button.

‘A third called the Northern Rail staff to help but they just stood there like lemons,’ he said.

Mr Lees, a scientist working in the road industry, added: ‘I dashed up the escalator – she was in a very precarious position. Afterwards I asked [the staff] why they didn’t help and they said they weren’t allowed to because they weren’t “people-handling trained”.

‘I said it was shameful behaviour.’ Northern Rail runs passenger trains across the north of England and is the largest train operator in the UK. This week it introduced peak evening fares – meaning some weekday tickets will cost 117 per cent more.

Mr Lees, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said the two Northern Rail staff were standing at the ticket barrier, about 20 yards away, in full view of the escalator.

‘After speaking to them I thought they were just misinformed staff so I gave the customer service line a call and they repeated the same line to me – that they’re not allowed to help because they’re not people-handling trained. It seemed to be against common human compassion.’

He added: ‘I said to them “if your granny fell over would you not hope that someone would pick her up?” They didn’t answer.’

After the incident last week, Mr Lees and two female passengers helped the elderly woman to a bench before comforting her and getting her a drink.

The woman, who was left shaken but is not believed to have been injured, has not been identified.

Last night the train company put the incident down to policy concerning the use of staff trained in first aid.

A Northern Rail spokesman said: ‘We’re sorry for any distress caused to the lady who fell or other customers who witnessed what happened. Our team report any accident directly to the station managers so a qualified first aider can be alerted immediately.’

But John Rowe, head of operations for the Health and Safety Executive in Yorkshire and the Humber, said it was a ‘ridiculous’ situation, adding: ‘There nothing in the Health and Safety at Work Act that prevents people offering assistance to others in distress.

‘I can only think that either the company’s own policies are being stretched and misinterpreted by their employees, or the individuals in question didn’t fancy getting involved and they just used health and safety as a convenient excuse.’
