The D-Day landings have been recreated as a virtual world to allow a new generation to experience the Invasion of Normady using 3D displays and virtual reality headsets.

French researchers painstakingly scanned and recreated the landing craft, gliders and even the artificial harbour, known as the Mulberry harbour, for the virtual invasion recreation.

The team today revealed their work as part of the seventieth anniversary of D-Day and the Invasion of Normandy.

The Mulberry Harbor was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of WWII. Developed in part by Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers, it was an artificial harbor built in England, transported across the English Channel and assembled off the coast at Arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle.

Tim Beckett, son of Major Allan Beckett, who designed the mile-long Mulberry Harbor bridge, stands on a virtual recreation of his father's work, long lost under the waters of Normandy, France.  In order to preserve the engineering innovations that were instrumental in the war, a team of experts led by Dassault Systèmes used CATIA design software to accurately recreate the harbor, and have projected into onto giant screens and into VR goggles.

Some of the innovations engineered for the invasion and now recreated are:

Landing Craft, Vehicle & Personnel (LCVP) was designed by American businessman Andrew Jackson Higgins and carried a platoon-sized CK complement of men and weapons to the beaches of Normandy.

Waco CG-4A gliders were relatively small, lightweight and maneuverable planes.

Most importantly, they were silent and could land troops in enemy territory during the early hours of the June 6 invasion.

The glider could carry up to 13 men or a vehicle.  

Dassault Systèmes, the Paris firm behind the project, say it is designed to 'safeguard the memory of some of the remarkable engineering achievements of D-Day and preserve it for future generations,’

The 3D model is an accurate, scientific reconstruction of the Harbor that will allow many to see and experience a site that was destroyed after WWII.

The Dassault Systèmes teams also identified, located and gathered all available data in order to create detailed 3D models of both the Waco glider and LCVP landing craft, right down to the last nut and bolt, taking careful account of the specific materials used and how they would have behaved in actual conditions.

'Virtually reconstructing the Mulberry Harbor, the LCVP landing craft and the Waco glider brings to life one of the most exciting episodes of 20th-century history for the broadest possible audience, safeguarding this valuable part of our engineering heritage – a heritage that is gradually being lost,' said Mehdi Tayoubi, Passion for Innovation Institute Director & Experiential Strategy VP for Dassault Systèmes.

'This project builds a bridge between the engineers of yesterday and today by preserving the memory of these remarkable technological innovations. The result is a fitting tribute to the engineers of then and now.'

Much of the hardware deployed on D-Day was part of a huge effort among the Allies to develop the weapons, airplanes, landing crafts and other innovations that could turn the tide of the war.

A beach assault required the engineering of wholly new ways to land an invading army, along with the necessary gear and supplies that the operation entailed.

The LCVP or Higgins boat was a landing craft which allowed the Allies to disembark massive numbers of men on the beaches of Normandy 70 years ago.

The Waco Glider was accurately recreated in 3D by Dassault Systèmes, using what remained of the original blueprints and designs. The Glider was one of many engineering innovations built specifically to enable the Allied victory in WWII.

The Dassault Systèmes’ recreation of the Mulberry Harbor will be featured in an upcoming two-hour documentary, “D-Day’s Sunken Secrets,” produced by the PBS science series, NOVA.

The film follows the team as they carry out the most extensive survey ever done of the seabed bordering the legendary D-Day beachheads of Normandy, revealing the ingenious technology that helped the Allies overcome the German defenses and ultimately liberate Europe from the Nazis.

One of the key parts of the project was the Mulberry Harbour

The Mulberry Harbour was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of WWII.

Developed in part by Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers, it was an artificial harbor built in England, transported across the English Channel and assembled off the coast at Arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle.

An artificial harbor was assembled off the coast at Arromanches — the first temporary deepwater facility of its kind ever devised and attempted.

It was be used to offload no less than 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles and 4 million tonnes of supplies.

Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers developed a system of floating metal roadways mounted on pontoon units of concrete or steel, which connected the beaches to the floating pierheads, further out to sea where large vessels could berth.

Thanks to legs that rested on the seabed but allowed these floating platforms to move up and down with the tide, operations could continue round the clock, which was a world first.

The system used to join the floating sections gave them great flexibility, absorbing movements caused by sea swell and the weight of vehicles moving over them.

The ‘kite’ anchors, which moored the floating platforms to the seabed, were designed to dig in further when the cable is pulled, keeping the structure firmly in place throughout the landing operations.

Huge reinforced concrete caissons were laid in a semicircle around the artificial harbor to form a breakwater, protecting it from tide surges and storm damage.

By the end of July 1944, the Mulberry B at Arromanches was the world’s busiest port in terms of traffic volumes.

The Mulberry Harbor was the first temporary deep water facility of its kind ever devised.

Today, nearly seventy years after D-Day, only pieces of the Harbor remain.

To recreate the Harbor, the Dassault Systèmes team compiled what remained of the original plans from the Royal Engineers Museum in London, the construction and maintenance manuals, the aerial photographs taken at the time and additional information provided by Tim Beckett, the son of Mulberry Harbor designer Allan Beckett, himself a marine engineer.

All of this valuable data was brought together and scrutinized over a period of almost eight months by the lab teams, to enable the son of its inventor to virtually stand on it in an immersive 3D experience.

Built in CATIA, the same technology used by leading manufacturers to digitally design cars, airplanes and other advanced products, people can experience these 3D recreations through a number of different technologies, from typical computer screens, to Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets, to an immersive virtual reality experience as shown here.
