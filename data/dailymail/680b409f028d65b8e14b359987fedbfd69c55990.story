It takes an average of 22 years for survivors of child abuse to come forward and many Australians who have been abused still haven’t spoken out, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse says.

In its interim report, released on Monday, the commission said on average female victims were nine years old and male victims 10 years old when the abuse started and that it takes men longer than women to disclose their abuse.

The commission, which began its inquiry into institutional abuse on 13 January 2013, said its analysis also showed 90 per cent of sex abusers are men.

'We understand that although many people have come forward to the Royal Commission, it is likely that they represent only a minority of those abused,’  the commission said.

'Many others are yet to disclose their abuse or, for various reasons, feel unable to come forward at this time.’

On Monday, the commission which has already been running for 18 months, urged the federal government to give it more time and money to finish its job or risk squandering the opportunity and insulting the victims.

The commission said it needs another $104 million and an extra two years to do its job and reach more vulnerable groups.

Truth Justice and Healing Council chief executive Francis Sullivan says the inquiry into institutional responses to child sex abuse must be given the time and resources it wants.

'To not finish the job properly and completely would be an insult to all the victims of abuse and one of the greatest lost opportunities of our generation,’ he said in a statement.

'This is a once in a lifetime chance for the community to fully understand the devastation of child sexual abuse, its historic pervasion into so many different institutions and steps needed to ensure past tragedies are never revisited.’

Attorney-General George Brandis said the interim report made clear the enormous scale of the task being undertaken by the commission.

'It is important that those affected by child sexual abuse and the Australian community as a whole can learn from the commission's work so far,’ he said in a brief statement.

The federal government was considering the request for a two year extension of the royal commission's December 31, 2015 closing date to deliver its final report, it said.

The commission’s investigation into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has many different parts to it.

Firstly, it is running a series of research projects into child sex abuse, including a history of abuse offences in Australia and analysis to identify possible sentencing reform for child abusers.

It is also planning a review of the strengths and challenges of mandatory reporting requirements in Australia.

Another project currently in the scoping phase is a review of evidence to explain the relevance of child pornography and child exploitation material to child sexual abuse in institutions.

In its two volume interim report, 14 case studies investigated by the commission over the past 18 months are covered.

The report includes the personal stories of 150 people who shared their experience of abuse by coming to a private session or providing a written account.

The commission has held hearings across Australia into how religious, educational and youth institutions responded to allegations of abuse, in some cases dating back decades.

The report says by the end of 2015 the Royal Commission will have conducted up to 4,000 private sessions but unless it is extended for two additional years it will not be able to hold a private session for anyone who contacts them after September this year.

'This will deny many survivors of the opportunity to share their experiences with us, in particular those from vulnerable or hard-to-reach groups.’

'We need another two years to complete the additional 30 hearings we have identified as essential to fulfill the terms of reference.’

In one of the scoping phase projects, school-based child sexual abuse prevention policies and curricula will be audited and compared with overseas models.

In another, there will be a review of pre-employment screening practices for child-related work.

A large project relates to the history of child sex abuse in Australia, with a review of factors and events linked to understanding of this form of abuse since the arrival from the first fleet.

Data from the royal commission's private sessions with abuse victims will be analysed to assess characteristics of both victims and offenders and the impact on victims.

Those convicted of institutional child sex abuse will be sentenced, possibly to jail terms. The commission wants to see whether that process can be reformed.

Also under examination will be trial processes and how evidence can be given by child sexual abuse complainants for use in court.

The commission has said children can help design institutions that are safe for them as they have the knowledge and experience different to adults.

Research into the views of children about their safety from sexual abuse in institutions has thus been ordered.

The commission is yet to reach a view on a national redress scheme for survivors.

'We have not yet reached a view on a national scheme,’ the commission said.

Four Australian states have offered redress schemes for former residents of child institutions in Qld, WA, Tas and SA.

The schemes have different coverage, eligibility rules, validation procedures and payment options.

Incomplete data from the Catholic Church's National Committee for Professional Standards shows Church authorities have paid more than $43 million to claimants since 1997.

The commission is considering whether it is appropriate in principal to recommend a national scheme, if its possible to devise a scheme that's fair to both claimants and institutions and how that scheme might fit with existing redress schemes.

'The Royal Commission understands the importance of this issue to victims and institutions and will consult widely as our thinking develops,’ the report said.

Meanwhile, the Salvation Army is facing a slump in donations to its flagship fundraising drive after the inquiry’s revelations of terrible sexual abuse of children in its care.

Donations to the Red Shield Appeal Doorknock in May are down an estimated 20 per cent this year.

Spokesman Major Bruce Harmer said the evidence heard at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was a key factor.

The church expects to fall 20 per cent or $2 million short of its $10 million target for the doorknock held on May 24 and 25.

It also expects to miss the $80 million target of the broader Red Shield Appeal, which includes corporate and other donations.
