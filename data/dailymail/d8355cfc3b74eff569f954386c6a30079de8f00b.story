Liverpool fans are about to find out if it's mere coincidence that Daniel Sturridge's injury has triggered a run of poor form, or whether the 25-year-old striker really is the most important player at Anfield, ahead of Raheem Sterling and Steven Gerrard.

Sturridge is due back on Sunday against QPR after a thigh injury controversially picked up on England duty at the start of September, with Liverpool facing Real Madrid three days later.

And the facts are these. Before Sturridge's injury, Liverpool had won two of their three matches and scored six goals. A win ratio of 66 per cent and goal average of two per game.

Since his lay-off, Liverpool have won two of seven games and scored only eight goals despite signing Mario Balotelli from AC Milan for £16million. A win percentage of 28.57 per cent and goal average of 1.14 per game.

No wonder Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is so looking forward to his England striker's return.

'Daniel is obviously a top talent whatever part of the game he comes into. And it helps to have his pace especially when you are 1-0 up and the opposition has to come at you,' says Rodgers, whose unhappiness with the way England handled his player's recovery time is well-documented and opened a sore between club and country that shows no sign of healing.

The exploits of Luis Suarez last season and the hype surrounding Sterling since the World Cup has helped people forget it could be Sturridge who is the key man at Liverpool.

Mario Balotelli has struggled since his £16m move to Liverpool from AC Milan in the summer

He scored 21 times in 26 Premier League starts last season and his influence didn't stop there. A shooting accuracy of 49.41 per cent underlines his composure in front of goal in addition to his undoubted pace, movement and dribbling skills. Half of those shots on target resulted in goals.

Particularly impressive is the number of opportunities he creates. Last season, he made 29 chances in league games. In the three matches he played this season, he scored once, had five other shots and created three chances.

Without him, the form of Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Balotelli and Rickie Lambert has diminished with Jordan Henderson having to work overtime to be a creator as well as a midfield general.

Balotelli has scored just one goal for Liverpool, in the Champions League against Ludogorets and missed this chance against Everton

Rickie Lambert has started just two games for Liverpool since his £4m move from Southampton

He is integral to Rodgers staying true to Liverpool's pass-and-move philosophy. Around 75 per cent of Sturridge's passes in the opposition half are accurate, impressive given the close marking he receives.

Gerrard, who has played with a few decent strikers in his time, has said of Sturridge: 'His movement is fantastic. As a midfielder when you look up, you want to see one of your forwards coming in to feet for the easy option and you want to see one on the shoulder of the defence and in between the two centre halves.'

Is it too simplistic to say Sturridge's imminent return will spark Liverpool into a revival and recapture last season's form when they nearly won the league?

It is a lot to rest on one player's shoulders but the Kop will hope Sturridge will show straight away just how badly he's been missed.
