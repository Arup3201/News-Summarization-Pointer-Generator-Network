Considering there is a ban on fans in the Arena Khimki, there were plenty of bodies in the stadium for Tuesday night’s match. Around 650 people were inside the ground - club officials, sponsors and media - as well as a gathering of fans outside the stadium endeavouring to make themselves heard. In fact, songs went back and forth between the fans and the sponsors, who were enthusiastic enough to suggest they weren’t entirely impartial viewers.

Didi Hamann is not afraid to express his opinion, and the former City midfielder voiced his concerns over Manuel Pellegrini’s team selection during the first half. ‘I wonder how long Pellegrini can justify playing Toure,’ Hamann tweeted, only for the Ivorian to run the game with a pass completion rate of 96 per cent.

The temperature at the Khimki was below freezing on Tuesday night - Aleksandar Kolarov, Vincent Kompany, James Milner and Pablo Zabaleta were the only City players not wearing gloves - but not as cold as relations between the two clubs after racist chanting directed at Yaya Toure during City’s last visit to Moscow. It was interesting, therefore, that City’s chief executive and chairman didn’t make the trip to Russia this time.
