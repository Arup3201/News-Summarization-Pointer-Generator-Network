Footage of a mid-air plane crash usually only appears on the silver screen, but unlucky filmmaker had a prime vantage point - he was on the damaged aircraft.

Cameraman Eric Don managed to capture the terrifying moment that two single-engine planes collided in midair in the Netherlands on Saturday.

The crash occurred when the light aircraft pulling an advert for the Christian Democrats drifted too close to the Cessna carrying members of the Socialist Party.

This caused the latter's landing gear to become embedded in the former's wing, fusing the two planes together, reported Gawker.

In the video, passengers can be heard shouting in panic as the camera spins around.

Both planes start to plummet, but their pilots managed to regain their position and hold their course.

One plane was forced to make an emergency landing on a beach with a damaged wing while the other plane returned to Rotterdam airport and made a safe landing.

No one was injured in the collision.

Mr Donk, told Dutch news channel RTL the encounter was 'tense and frightening.'

We were some 150 metres above the ground. I could have touched the other plane if I had wanted to,' he said.

Dutch aviation safety authorities are now investigating the near-disaster.
