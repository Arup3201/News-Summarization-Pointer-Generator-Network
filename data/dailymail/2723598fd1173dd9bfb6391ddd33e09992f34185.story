FIFA president Sepp Blatter has called for a rethink on the away goals rule and questioned whether the method for settling knock-out games still makes sense.

The system - where the team who has scored the most goals away from home wins the tie if the scores are level - has been used since 1965 in European competition and still applies in the Champions League and Europa League.

Blatter claims the rule favours teams playing away from home in the second leg because those games can go to extra time meaning more time to score an away goal.

In his column in the FIFA Weekly magazine, which is being published on Friday, Blatter pointed out the rule was scrapped in the Championship play-offs in 2000.

Blatter says: 'It is time to rethink the system. Football has progressed since the 1960s, so the away goals rule may now be questioned. Does the away goals rule still make sense?

'The idea dates back to a time when away games were often an adventure, involving journeys that could be long and arduous - and the playing conditions would vary considerably.

'In reality it favours the club that play away from home in the second leg. Where the scores are tied, that team has 30 minutes more than their opponent to score a valuable away goal. After all, in the first leg there is no extra time.

'Such an imbalance has already been disposed of in various competitions. The away goals rule is no longer used in the semi-finals of the promotion play-offs in English football.'

Blatter suggested a modification could be used such as in employed in MLS play-offs in the USA and in the CONCACAF Champions League where away goals only count 'double' until the end of normal time in the second leg and not in extra time.
