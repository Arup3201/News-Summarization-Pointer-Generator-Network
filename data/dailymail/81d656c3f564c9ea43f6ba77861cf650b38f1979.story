Iran has denied reports of a major explosion at its Fordow nuclear facility, one of its most sensitive uranium enrichment sites.

The country has described the claims as Western propaganda which they say is intended to influence upcoming international nuclear negotiations.

The reports originate with Israeli intelligence sources in Tel Aviv, who since Friday have spoken of an explosion damaging the Fordow bunker which is situated deep under a mountain near the religious city of Qom.

The explosion is believed to have occurred early last week.

'The false news of an explosion at 
Fordow is Western propaganda ahead of nuclear negotiations to influence 
their process and outcome,' the Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted the deputy 
head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, Saeed Shamseddin Bar Broudi, 
as saying late on Sunday night.

Iran's ISNA news agency backed up the denial, and quoted military commander Massoud Jazayeri as saying: 'I deny an explosion at the Fordow site.'

The Iranians do not appear to have evacuated the area surrounding the site, which sources claim suffered severe structural damage and may have 200 workers trapped inside.

In late 2011 Fordow began producing uranium enriched to 20 percent fissile purity - below the 90 per cent level used in nuclear bombs, but very high compared with the 3.5 percent level needed for nuclear energy plants.

The Islamic state says it is producing 
20 percent uranium to make fuel for a research reactor in Tehran that 
produces medical isotopes, but the move provoked fears that the uranium could be converted to bomb-grade.

Several U.N. Security Council resolutions have ordered Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment.

Speculation over the explosion followed a report that international discussions on Iran's disputed nuclear programme may be resumed.

The European Union, the lead negotiator on the talks, said there was no such agreement.

Diplomats in Vienna, where the United Nations' nuclear agency is based, said they were looking into the reports of an incident at Fordow. One Western diplomat said he did not believe they were accurate.

Iran has accused Israel and the United States of trying to sabotage its nuclear programme, due to suspicions that it hides attempts to develop atomic bombs.

The Islamic republic says its atomic programme is entirely peaceful and Tehran has accused Israel and the U.S. of being behind cyber attacks on its nuclear programme and the assassination of its nuclear scientists.

Washington denied any role in the killings and no government has taken responsibility for the Stuxnet computer virus that destroyed centrifuges at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility in 2010, despite widespread reports that it was the result of a U.S. and Israeli government project.

Israel has hinted at possible military action against Iran if diplomacy fails to resolve the dispute.

Avi Dichter, the Israeli Civil Defence Minister, could not say anything about the reported Fordow blast 'beyond what I heard in the media' but added: 'Any explosion in Iran which does not harm people but harms Iran's assets is a blessing.'

Three rounds of talks last year between Iran and Russia, the United States, China, Britain, France and Germany produced no resolution, increasing speculation that Israel could attack Iranian nuclear installations.
