They say every little girl dreams of being a princess.

So these two toddlers may have to think up a new ambition.

In an adorable series of photographs, one-year-old Chloe Corona and her two-year-old cousin Claire West dressed up as their favorite Disney characters.

And the results are magical.

Adorable! Chloe Corona takes a bite out of a shiny red apple in the fairy tale photo shoot dress as Snow White

Dreams come true: Chloe's cousin Claire West looks up cheekily as she takes to the stage for her picture

Their mothers created each little costume, set and prop by hand at home in Orange County, California - a stone's throw from Disneyland.

It included Alice in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, and Peter Pan's Wendy. 

For the Little Red Riding Hood scene, they even managed to get hold of a TV-trained wolf from Los Angeles.

Fairy tale: Claire looked delighted to be reenacting some cleaning in her Cinderella shoot

Chloe, on the other hand, got straight to work scrubbing the floors with a concentrated look on her face 

Too excited to sleep! Claire looks too happy to be dressed as Aurora from Sleeping Beauty to have a nap

Delighted: Chloe also donned the pink costume designed by her mother and aunt for the playful project

Playful: Photographer Myranda Josephson photoshopped Peter Pan's shadow onto the wall in the image

Fairy dust! Chloe was given a bit of Tinkerbell's magic as she sat dressed as Wendy from the famous tale

Photographer Myranda Josephson said the two little models were hilarious. 

'Claire and Chloe loved it,' she said. 'They are already very animated toddlers, so it definitely made the experience even more enchanting!'

With an overwhelming influx of praise, she plans to continue with another series - next time including Beauty and the Beast, and the Little Mermaid.  

Hostess with the mostest: Claire seemed to be waiting for her tea party guests in her Alice in Wonderland outfit

Not waiting! Chloe, however, dived straight into the buffet laid out on little tables with cards on the wall

What an experience! The girls loved posing with a real life wolf, hired from a TV company in Los Angeles

Ecstatic: Chloe cackles gleefully as the wolf looks her way while she is dressed as Little Red Riding Hood

Tentative... At first, Claire doesn't know how to react as she stands next to the white animal 

Making friends: Eventually she plucks up the courage to stroke the wolf... although he's not so sure!
