Stoke are keen on a deal for Fulham midfielder Steve Sidwell who is out of contract this summer.

The 31-year-old has been attracting interest from West Ham manager Sam Allardyce, but Mark Hughes is keen to take him to the Britannia Stadium as he looks to continue his re-shaping of Stokeâ€™s football style.

The former Arsenal, Chelsea and Aston Villa man was one of the Cottagers' few consistent performers this season but was unable to stop them being relegated after a run of 13 seasons in the Premier League.

Keen: Stoke manager Mark Hughes also wants to sign Sidwell

Hughes managed Sidwell during his season as Fulham boss in 2010-11 and has been quick to identify the ex-England Under-21 player as someone who could do a job for Stoke.

Fulham manager Felix Magath is preparing for a summer of change and has already ordered his underperforming stars in for extra end-of-season training sessions in order to help him decide who is worthy of keeping in the Championship.

Meanwhile, the club's owner Shahid Khan has already expressed a desire to invest heavily in the club in order to ensure a quick return to the top-flight.

He said: 'This is not about balancing the books.

'I am committed and we are going to do whatever to get them back to the Premier League. It (relegation) is not what we wanted, but it is reality. What we have to do is build it for the long haul.

'We are going to do whatever it takes to put the best team on the field. I have talked to Felix and what we want to do is what is in the best interest of the team.'

Forced exit: With Sidwell out of contract Magath may have no opportunity to keep him
