A psychopath with a string of domestic violence convictions beat his lover to death in a row over Christmas presents two weeks after he was freed from jail.

Russian Anastasia Voykina, 23, moved in with Felipe Lopes because she was 'idealistic' and wanted to help him overcome his mental health issues, the Old Bailey heard.

But Lopes had a heated argument with her over a Christmas present and knocked their festive tree down the stairs, the court heard.

Later, he woke her by pouring a bottle of cola over her face before sexually assaulting and bludgeoning her with a hockey stick at their maisonette flat in Streatham, south London.

He left her body lying in the flat for more than a week with her leopard-print pyjama bottoms wrapped around her neck.

She was only found after she was listed as a missing person a week later, and police put out an appeal to find Lopes.

Lopes, 28, admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

He said voices in his head told him to kill her and were saying: 'I'm her master'.

Prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC said: 'The evidence suggests that Anastasia lost her life because she was idealistic.

'She believed she could help the defendant.

'She clearly loved the defendant and tried to change him. Sadly that cost her her life.

'Her friends said she was a lovely person but a bit naive.

'She wanted to explore the world and particularly loved London and everything London had to offer.'

Lopes,
 who had several convictions for assaulting ex-girlfriends, had ignored 
warnings to keep taking his medication and stop smoking cannabis, the 
court heard.

He was released from Belmarsh Prison, London, on December 12 last year after serving his latest sentence.

The last time Miss Voykina was seen alive was on December 29, the day she is believed to have been killed.

Her
 naked body lay on the floor of the blood-soaked maisonette they shared 
for more than a week until it was found at 2am on January 7 this year.

Miss Voykina had about 60 injuries to her face, head and neck.

Her injuries also showed that she had 
been sexually assaulted during the attack. Lacy material was found 
wrapped around her neck along with a pair of leopard print pyjama 
bottoms.

'Anastasia was attacked in the bedroom, possibly while she was asleep,' Miss Johnson said.

'Her body was dragged into the
 bathroom and she was lifted into the bath and left there bleeding for 
enough time to leave a pool of blood in the bath.

'She was dragged into the lounge and left.'

In an interview after he was arrested, Lopes said a voice had told him to kill Miss Voykina, who was asleep in bed at the time.

'Anastasia
 went to bed and the defendant was in the living room,' Miss Johnson 
said. ‘He heard a male voice saying “I’m her master”.

‘The voice told him to kill Anastasia but not why.

‘He went into the bedroom where she was asleep and poured a bottle of coke over her heard which woke her up.

‘The defendant grabbed a hockey stick and attacked Anastasia.

‘He continued hearing the voice in his head and also Anastasia saying “I’m with my master”.

‘The voice then told him to leave the flat.’

Anastasia’s mother said her death had caused her ‘irreparable injury’.

Lopes, a Portuguese national, pleaded guilty during a hearing last month and appeared at the Old Bailey today to be sentenced.

He has been diagnosed with schizoid defective disorder, and the court must decide whether he will be jailed or detained under a hospital order.

Psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph said Lopes had 'marked psychopathic traits.'

The sentencing hearing continues and the judge is due to reach a decision on Monday.
