On a 'cliff edge': Tony Melville, Chief Constable of Gloucestershire Police has warned that further cuts to the force would affect front-line policing

Police officer numbers have fallen by more than 6,000 in a year, figures revealed last night.

Sharp cuts have taken police strength
to its lowest level for a decade, sparking claims that David Cameron is
‘letting down communities’ and endangering public safety.

But ministers insisted forces could 
cut overall numbers while protecting the front line, and pointed to the 
25,000 officers doing ‘backroom jobs’.

The figures emerged as a senior officer warned that the threat of further cuts had left his force on a ‘cliff edge’.

Tony Melville, Chief Constable of 
Gloucestershire, where the local police authority is threatening a 
further funding reduction on top of Home Office budget cuts, said the 
force had a plan to deliver ‘a good quality of service, whilst still 
making the savings required’.

But he added: ‘It is only possible to continue with that plan if this extra cut is not imposed.

‘It is quite possible that, in the 
future, [the service] will look very different to what the public have 
come to know and expect.’

The total Home Office grant for forces in England and Wales will fall by 20 per cent by 2015.

Police forces must work together to 
bring in a national air service that will save £15million a year, the 
Policing Minister will say today.

Nick Herbert will say powers to order 
forces to collaborate with each other will be used for the first time to
replace each force’s own helicopter with the national unit.

Under the plans, the number of police helicopters and air bases will be slashed by a third across England and Wales.

Mr Herbert will say the National 
Police Air Service (NPAS) will provide forces with access to helicopters
24 hours a day, 365 days year, rather than a force’s helicopter being 
out of use for weeks for repairs.

There were 30 police air bases serving
32 aircraft, costing the 43 forces about £70m a year, when the review 
of air support started in 2009. Under the plans this will be cut to 22 
bases serving 24 aircraft - shaving £15million off the air support 
budget.

Hampshire Police Chief Constable Alex 
Marshall, who has spearheaded the proposals and will head the new unit, 
said the current response rate - which sees 97 per cent of the 
population receive air support in 20 minutes - would not be affected.

'This is not merely a cost saving 
exercise,' he said. 'A national, borderless service will ensure 
effective coverage of urban and rural areas.'

But not all forces have shown support,
with Meredydd Hughes, the former chief constable of the South Yorkshire
force, claiming the densely populated city of Sheffield would suffer.

Ministers insist savings – including 
cuts to pay, overtime and bonuses – can be made while maintaining the 
service provided to the public.

Policing minister Nick Herbert said: 
‘There were around 25,000 officers in backroom jobs, giving forces 
plenty of scope to save money while protecting the front line.

'In fact, 
forces are protecting neighbourhood policing, and the proportion of the 
police workforce on the front line is rising.

‘What matters most is how officers 
are deployed. By cutting bureaucracy and working more efficiently, 
police visibility on the streets can be improved.’

There is now a total of 136,261 officers in England and Wales, a fall of 6,012 – or 4 per cent – on 12 months ago.

The biggest falls were in large urban
forces.

In London, the total fell by 1,267, in Manchester 320 and in 
the West Midlands nearly 500. However, Surrey police increased officer 
numbers by nearly 100.

The number of community support 
officers across the country has fallen by 907, but there are an 
additional 2,594 volunteer special constables.

Figures produced by Her Majesty’s 
Inspectorate of Constabulary suggest officer numbers could fall by 
another 8,000 in coming years.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘These shocking figures show the biggest fall in police numbers in over a decade.

‘At the same time personal crime 
including theft and  violence has gone up by 11  per cent – the biggest 
increase in a decade.

'David Cameron and Theresa May are letting down 
communities and turning their backs on the police.’

Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police
Federation, said: ‘How can we possibly provide  the same level of 
service to the public if we are losing thousands of officers?’
