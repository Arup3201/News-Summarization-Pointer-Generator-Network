The US Army is set to launch the first of two blimps designed to help the military detect and destroy cruise missiles or rogue aircraft incursions targeting America's East Coast cities.

The first radar-toting vehicle will be set airborne next week as part of a three-year test of the latest defense system at an Army facility near Baltimore, Maryland.

When fully deployed next February, the $2.8billion system will feature two, unmanned, helium-filled aerostats - able to scan the oceans and coastline in a 340-mile radius. 

Defense project: The US Army is set to launch the first of two blimps designed to help the military detect and destroy cruise missiles targeting the nation's capital or other major East Coast cities

One balloon will continuously scan in a circle from upstate New York to North Carolina's Outer Banks, and as far west as central Ohio. 

The other will carry precision radar to help the military on the ground to pinpoint targets. 

The system is called JLENS - short for Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System. 

The project, built by Raytheon Co. of Waltham, Massachusetts, and TCOM L.P. of Columbia, Maryland, has cost the government about $2.8 billion so far.

And last week Congress approved another $43.3 million for the first year of the test.

Reducing costs: Despite the project setting the US government back by £2.8billion, experts say the airships will save money in the long run by reducing the need for surveillance by conventional aircraft

Despite the staggering cost, supporters of the project say JLENS will save money in the long run by reducing the need for surveillance by conventional aircraft.

'The analysis we've done says it's about five to seven times less than operating a fleet of aircraft to cover the same area over the same time period,' said Douglas Burgess, Raytheon's JLENS program director.

The white balloons, each 80 yards long, are part of a new wave of lighter-than-air surveillance equipment. 

Testing: A giant radar dome is seen on the bottom of the unmanned aerostat, which will be launched next week

They will not carry weapons as enemy missiles would be destroyed by air, ground or ship-based weapons. 

Major General Glen Bramhall, commander of the 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense, said: 'We can defeat cruise missiles but we have limited capability to detect.

'And so, with an elevated sensor, such as JLENS, and the ability to look out over the horizon, now we have the ability to detect and to enable our systems to defeat cruise missiles.'

The government has also deployed tethered airships near the Mexican border, in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the Caribbean Ocean to combat drug smuggling.

The airships at Aberdeen, Maryland, will be the first of their type near a major East Coast city, visible from Interstate 95.

Plan: When fully deployed next spring, the system will feature two, unmanned, helium-filled aerostats, tethered to concrete pads 4 miles apart

The military has insisted that the balloons will not carry cameras in response to privacy campaigners' concerns about snooping. 

But David Rocah, of the American Civil Liberties Union in Maryland, said the group was leery of the airships' ability to constantly monitor moving objects, including cars on the ground.

Mr Bramhall says the radar is unable to identify individuals or record cellphone conversations.

'The mission is not to spy on U.S. citizens. It is not designed for that,' he said.
