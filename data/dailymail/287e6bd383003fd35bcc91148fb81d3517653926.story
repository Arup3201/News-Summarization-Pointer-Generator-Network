A disabled man was told he couldn't appeal against a decision to scrap his benefits because he was dead.

Tim Green, 58, was appalled when civil servants wrote to his shocked relatives to say he would no longer have to attend an appeal against a decision to take away his handouts as he 'had died'.

But just a week later, Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service, declared him not only alive, but fit to return to work too.

Shocked: Tim Green, 56, was told he was not entitled to appeal against a decision to scrap his benefits

The death letter was sent to Tim's ex-wife Jane who helps him fill out paperwork because he is partially blind.

Self-employed accountant Jane, 55, said: 'It was pretty horrible to receive the letter.

'Tim hadn't been well and then I got a
letter through the post telling me he had died. I started shaking and 
wondering how I'd tell our daughter.'

Mr Green,
from Staffordshire, said: 'My family were worried sick. They knew I had
been feeling unwell and then my ex-wife received a letter saying I was 
dead.

'She was straight on the phone to my mother. I couldn't believe it when I heard what was in the letter. I'm certainly not dead.

'It was funny though, my first reaction was to laugh. Eventually everyone saw the funny side of it.

Mistake: The letter from civil servants to Mr Green's ex-wife that declared he was dead

Mr Green had worked as a builder since the age of 15 and said he loved his job.

He said: 'I haven't been able to work since a piece of metal went through my eye when I was bricklaying in 2004.

'There wasn't any pain or blood but I 
haven't been able to see from it since. I stumble and fall over 
regularly now, it would be impossible to work, if I could I would.'

'My family were worried sick. They knew I had
been feeling unwell and then my ex-wife received a letter saying I was 
dead.'

Mr Green

The father-of-one, who also suffers with hip, leg, liver and shoulder problems, was told he is fit enough to seek work and faces losing £40-a-week employment support allowance benefit.

Mr Green said: 'I need that £40 a week, but what you haven't got you can't have.'

He appealed against the Department for Work and Pensions' decision twice, but was unsuccessful.

Tim
said: 'I don't see the point in trying again. My doctor has signed me 
off now, but if I thought I had a chance I would appeal.'

HMCTS's
letter said: 'The appeal was delayed as the appellant had died.

'I have 
now abated the appeal, which will not go forward to a tribunal hearing.'

But a week later the service ruled Tim is in fact alive and well enough to seek employment.

HMCTS
officials have now issued a formal apology saying: 'This letter was 
sent in error. We are taking steps to ensure that proper procedures are 
followed in future.'

Mr Green said no written apology was issued and he has no choice but to accept the decision.

An
HMCTS spokesman said: 'This letter was sent in error. We take this 
incident very seriously and have apologised to the party concerned.

'We are taking steps to ensure that proper procedures are followed in future.'
