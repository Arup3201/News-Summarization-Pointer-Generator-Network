An outfield player being forced to go in goal is perhaps one of the most entertaining sights in football. 

However, nothing compares to one being forced to go in goal for a vital penalty shootout.

This is the fate that befell Ludogorets centre back Cosmin Moti during the Bulgarians' dramatic Champions League play-off against Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday night.

Hero: Makeshift goalkeeper Cosminn Moti celebrates after saving two penalties to send Ludogorets through

Progress: The Ludogorets players race to celebrate with Moti following his goalkeeping heroics

Natural: Moti dives to his left in an attempt to keep out a Steaua Bucharest penalty with the scores tied

Get in! Moti raced over the hoardings to celebrate with the Bulgarian champions' supporters

After substitute Wanderson scored a wonderful volley in the 90th minute to send the game to extra-time, 1-1 on aggregate, the defender was forced into goal for the shootout following the 119th minute dismissal of  goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov.

Moti, forced to wear the shirt of substitute keeper Ivan Cvorovic, was the hero of the night, scoring the first penalty for his side before making brilliant diving saves to deny Paul Pirvulescu and Cornel Rapa as Ludogorets won the shoot-out 6-5 to spark wild scenes.

After such a display, the Bulgarian champions' No 1 Stoyanov will do well to win his place back in the side.

Grateful: Dismissed goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov embraces a smiling Moti on Wednesday night
