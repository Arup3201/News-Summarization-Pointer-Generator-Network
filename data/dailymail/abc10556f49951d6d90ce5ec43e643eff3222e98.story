Two women are accused of showing off more than their putting skills at a public golf course.

Madison County Sheriff's Capt. Mike Dixon says investigators responded to complaints of lewd behaviour Monday at the Woodlands Golf Course in Alton, Illinois, and saw the women displaying their breasts.

Now, authorities in Madison County have charged 45-year-old Shelly Lewis and 43-year-old Alicia Binford of O'Fallon, Missouri, with public indecency, a misdemeanour.

They each posted $100 cash bond. 

Capt. Dixon told MailOnline that officers received complaints that the two women were repeatedly exposing their breasts in a public area of the golf course.

‘They weren’t topless in general,’ he said, ‘but they were exposing their breasts – obviously there’s a neighbourhood there, there are children around as there’s a subdivision built on the course, so there were concerns.’

It was unclear whether the women themselves were golfing, or if they were just accompanying other golfters.

He said that at the time of the arrests, ‘the officers didn’t witnesses Binford and Lewis golfing, they witnessed them pulling their shirts up.’

The incident is not a common one in Madison County. When asked whether this sort of thing happens frequently, Capt. Dixon responded: ‘I can’t remember ever having an incident like that in the past.

‘Individuals who go to the golf courses are somewhat reserved. 'At least I’ve never experienced that.’

He continued: ‘It’s a public course, it’s a very nice course. As I understand it, the course was rented out during the day by a private entity.’

The captain also confirmed that the two women are indeed wearing clothes in their mug shots. 'They're wearing halter-type tops,' he said.

The Riverfront Times had a theory that the women were professionals, to which Capt. Dixon responded: ‘They’re not strippers, they’re golfers.’

Binford and Lewis couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday; Binford's home telephone number has been disconnected. Lewis hasn't returned a message left at her home.
