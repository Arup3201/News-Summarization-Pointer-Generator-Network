A nine-year-old deaf girl's letter to Seahawks running back Derrick Coleman, who is also hearing-impaired, in which she said he was her inspiration has received an inspirational reply.

Riley Kovalcik, from Roxbury, 
New Jersey, penned the note to Coleman after she and her identical twin 
sister, Erin, who is also hearing impaired, watched a moving Duracell ad
 about his journey to become the first legally deaf offensive player in 
the NFL.

The letter went viral after her father posted a copy of it on Twitter and now Riley has received a heartfelt reply from the player.

The player also then tweeted a photo of a letter he had written in response. It read: 'Dear Miss Kovalcik, Thanks for the letter! Really was great hearing from a friend who I have so much in common with. I appreciate you rooting for the Seahawks and me and hope you continue to do so when we play in the Super Bowl!!!

'I want you to know that I always try my best in everything I do and have faith in you and your twin sister too. Even though we wear hearing aids, we can still accomplish our goals and dreams! If you or your family ever in Seattle, I hope we can all get together and play some sports or games!

He signed it off 'Take care, Derrick L. Coleman Jr.'

Too cute: Riley touched hearts across the nation after she wrote the adorable letter, pictured, to the Seahawks running back, calling him her 'insperation' and telling him 'I know how you feel'

Riley and her identical twin sister 
Erin, who is also deaf, were interviewed via Skype on Good Morning 
America Wednesday morning.

'I
 like that he actually can understand about being bullied and he 
actually knows more you know, stuff like if you have problems, heâ€™s a 
guy you can come to,' Riley said.

The
 sisters were glued to the TV Sunday, cheering as Coleman helped Seattle
 beat the San Francisco 49ers to make it through to this year's Super 
Bowl - and his success compelled Riley to reach out to the sportsman.

Her dad, Jake Kovalcik, then tweeted the
 heart-melting letter to the 23-year-old with the comment @Seahawks 
@DC2forlife you've inspired my little girls in a way I never could. 
THANK YOU! #Seahawks #SuperBowlXLVIII, and the photo has since taken the
 internet by storm.

'Dear, my insperation (sic) Derrick Coleman,' Riley's note starts off, 'I know how you feel. I also have hearing aids. Just try your best. I have faif (sic) in you.'

She continued, 'Derrick good job on January (19th) game. GO Seattle seahawks!'

The sweet fan went on to list what she and Coleman have in common.

'I where (sic) two hearing aids. I love sports. Other things are I'm a identical twin and my twin where's (sic) one hearing aid too!'

Jake Kovalcik told MailOnline the whole family was in awe after hearing Coleman's story for the first time in the Duracell ad.

'...So when the Seahawks were playing, the girls were right there watching and they were like, 'Where is he? Where is he?' he said.

When they won, his daughters were beyond excited.

'Riley said she wanted to write a note to Derrick and could I send it to him, so I said "of course." 'When I read it I was like "oh my god, really?"'

Kovalcik said he searched for Coleman on Twitter Sunday but the sportsman didn't have an account.

A day later, after the Duracell spot had captivated audiences around the country and perhaps the world, the football player had set one up.

'So I took a picture of the note and tweeted at him,' Kovalcik said.

Not held back: The proud father said apart from a couple of special classes, the girls, pictured, are treated the same as the other kids at their school

Outgoing: 'We have never treated them differently, it's just been "everyone has their challenges, this is how you're different and you do the best you can,"' Kovalcik said of his daughters, pictured here with their little brother, Aiden. 'They are wonderful, incredibly outgoing little girls'

Heart-felt: 'Riley said she wanted to write a note to Derrick and could I send it to him, so I said "of course." 'When I read it I was like "oh my god, really?"' the dad said

Before he knew it, the Seahawks had retweeted Riley's letter and his phone was beeping uncontrollably as more and more fans shared the touching message.

'Riley and Erin just sat there with my phone, watching, and they were like "oh my god dad, you went viral,"' he recalled, laughing.

But all Kovalcik really wanted was for Coleman to know the impact he'd had.

'I just wanted to show him what he had done,' he told MailOnline.

'He inspired my daughters but it's a great thing he's doing not just for hearing impaired kids or kids with other disabilities, he's showing all kids that if you work hard and you dedicate yourself whatever deficiencies you have, you can be great. I wanted to thank him.'

The proud father said apart from a couple of special classes, the girls are treated the same as the other kids at their school.

Blown away: Kovalcik and his wife Tracy were blown away by Coleman's success, he said. Coleman is pictured here as a child

We have never treated them differently, it's just been "everyone has their challenges, this is how you're different and you do the best you can,"' Kovalcik said. 'They are wonderful, incredibly outgoing little girls.'

He and his wife Tracy, who also have a five-year-old son, Aiden, said they were blown away by the success of the sportsman who has been deaf since the age of three.

'It's really amazing the fact he overcame so much as a little kid growing up when hearing aids, well they're still expensive today, but 10-15 years ago they were really expensive. He overcame it all.'

'We were Dolphins and Giants fans but I can guarantee my girls will be fans of his forever and I probably will be purchasing a lot of Seahawks gear in future.'

The dad added: 'It's great, it's just going to make watching the Superbowl this year that much better.'
