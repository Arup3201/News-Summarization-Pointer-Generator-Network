These stark aerial images show how dozens of homes in southern California were buried under unstoppable rock and mudslides this weekend.

The community of Camarillo Springs, north of Los Angeles, was hit hard as boulder-strewn rivers of mud swept down hillsides that a wildfire had stripped of vegetation last year.

The rocks and roots pushed into bedrooms, straight on through to the living room, cracking front windows. 

An earthmover that had been brought in ahead of the storm to clear debris was buried as well, with just its big mechanical arm left sticking up out of the muck.

'It's $200,000 (of equipment) sitting under there,' said heavy equipment mechanic Tony Morris. 'It was good at 11:30 when I left last night.'

One of the areas hardest hit on Friday was the community of Camarillo Springs, north of Los Angeles, where boulder-strewn rivers of mud swept down hillsides that a wildfire had stripped of vegetation last year

Ten homes in the community surrounding a golf course 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles, were red-tagged, indicating they were uninhabitable and off-limits, according to the Ventura County Fire Department. 

Three homes were yellow-tagged, meaning they were uninhabitable but residents could enter to retrieve items. 

Another three had lesser damage.

About 1,000 homes were placed under evacuation orders in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora, where mudslides from a wildfire-burned area there left several roads impassable overnight, police Lieutenant Matt Williams said.  

'It's amazing how much rock actually slid down the hill,' said sheriff's Capt. Don Aguilar.

Former Republican Rep. Elton Gallegly told KCAL-TV his house was destroyed by the debris flow.

'I don't know if there's anything salvageable,' he said.

'It's quite an earth-moving operation,' said Elton Gallegly, whose wife's family owns one of the damaged homes and who stopped by Saturday to check on progress

'It's quite an earth-moving operation,' said Elton Gallegly, whose wife's family owns one of the damaged homes and who stopped by Saturday to check on progress.

Gallegly, a former congressman, said work crews using a huge backhoe and several other vehicles told him they hoped to clear the road in front of the houses by dark. 

Though he was impressed by the 'incredible progress,' he thought that timeline was ambitious - and it still wouldn't mean the removal of tons of muck surrounding the homes.

The neighborhood's trouble was rooted in a fire that erupted nearby along U.S. 101 on May 2, 2013, as a dry and gusty Santa Ana wind pushed back moist breezes from the nearby ocean, sent humidity plunging to withering levels and fanned flames across the west end of the Santa Monica Mountains.

About 2,000 homes were threatened by flames and 15 sustained damage, but none was destroyed. When it was over, the fire had burned to the beach at Point Mugu and 44 square miles of rugged terrain were left devoid of protective vegetation.

Ted and Rita Elliot placed 400 sandbags around the back of their Camarillo Springs home and it was spared. On Friday they stood in their backyard looking at destruction next door.

'Wow, are we lucky!' said Ted.

'We'll be the only house on the block,' said Rita.

The Pacific storm pounded Southern California with heavy rain and high winds on Friday, triggering a small tornado, flash floods and mudslides that prompted the evacuation of hundreds of homes, damaged dozens of others and disrupted passenger rail services along the coast.

One person was found dead on Friday in a rain-swollen flood-control channel in the Orange County town of Garden Grove, which could mark the third storm-related fatality on the West Coast since Thursday.

Separately, rescue teams saved two people after they were swept away in the fast-moving Los Angeles River near a homeless encampment, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in Twitter messages.

High winds tore down power lines throughout the region, leaving as many as 78,000 customers without electricity at one point after the storm moved in before dawn, utility officials reported.

In an unusual phenomenon for Southern California, a small tornado touched down in South Los Angeles, where it damaged the roofs of an apartment complex and two houses and ripped up a billboard, said National Weather Service Specialist Stuart Seto. 

The twister was an EF0, the smallest category possible, and no one was hurt, he said.

The severe weather, which included thunderstorms, was spawned by a storm system dubbed a 'pineapple express,' a large low-pressure area that siphoned vast amounts of moisture from the tropical Pacific near the Hawaiian islands and dumped it on the West Coast as it moved over land, the National Weather Service said

The tornado was the first in Los Angeles since 2004, according to USTornadoes.com which tracks twisters. Weather Service meteorologists could not confirm that.

A water spout, which is like a tornado but occurs over water, was sighted over the ocean near Los Angeles International Airport on Friday morning, and another one formed 35 miles (56 kms) to the southeast off Newport Beach.

The same storm pummeled the Pacific Northwest and the northern half of California on Thursday with downpours and gale-force gusts that caused widespread power outages and disrupted commercial flights in San Francisco.  

The highest rainfall measured was at San Marcos Pass, just north of Santa Barbara, where more than 5 inches (12 cm) fell. 

Downtown Los Angeles had more than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of rain.

Harsh weather was blamed for two deaths on Thursday in Oregon. In southern Oregon near Ashland, a homeless man camping with his 18-year-old son was killed when a tree toppled onto their tent. Portland police said a tree fell on a car that then swerved into another tree, killing a boy who was a passenger.

It was not known whether the body in Garden Grove was a weather-related fatality or a victim who died of some other cause and was washed into the flood channel, officials said.

The storm was expected to provide little relief from the multi-year drought that has forced sharp cutbacks in irrigation supplies to farmers and conservation measures across California.
