Sir Alex Ferguson has described Hearts owner Ann Budge as ‘a guardian angel’ for galvanising the club following the devastating effects of administration.

The former Manchester United manager was in Edinburgh this week to attend the funeral of Hearts’ greatest-ever player Dave Mackay. But the 73-year-old also took time out to pay tribute to the leadership of Budge after head coach Robbie Neilson guided the team to the Championship title last weekend with seven games to spare.

Ferguson said: ‘I think Dave would be very proud of Hearts. As you know, they’ve been through a terrible time. I go back to when I was a boy and they were my sort of second team after Rangers, with the great players John Cumming, (Willie) Bauld, (Alfie) Conn and (Jimmy) Wardhaugh.

‘That period when things go so bad, I just think that sometimes a guardian angel comes along and saves you.

‘The job that Ann Budge has done has not only regenerated the club but it’s given everyone a lift in sense of the ambition is back in the club, they’re back in the Premier League.

‘They’ve won the Championship by 20-something points, it’s a phenomenal number of points and I’m delighted for them. I’m really proud of the job that Ann Budge has done.

‘I think it is onwards and upwards,’ Ferguson told Hearts TV. ‘I don’t think there’s anyway back now and you’ve found your way. Sometimes you get lost on the road to where you want to go to and now they’ve found their way again.

‘They look more than a useful team because I’ve watched them a few times this season. They play some really good football and I think you’ll be very welcome in the Premier Division, I’m sure of that, and you’ll do well.’

Meanwhile, Hearts legend John Robertson insists there is no chance the newly-crowned Championship winners will slack off out of respect for the teams still chasing promotion.

Neilson’s side have a role to play when it comes to who finishes among the three play-off places in the second tier.

Hearts host fourth-placed Queen of the South on Saturday and still have Rangers to play twice as well as an encounter against city rivals Hibs.

All-time record Hearts goal scorer Robertson, who also coaches the club’s Under-17s, insists the team is fully aware of their responsibilities for the remainder of the season.

‘We’ve got players that have not had a lot of game time and they’ll want to play,’ he said. ‘They’ll want to show between now and the end of the season they’re good enough for the Premiership.

‘There is also the integrity of the competition. Queen of the South are in a huge battle and there’s no way Robbie Neilson or the staff will rest players or put out what people perceive as a weakened team.

‘Last Saturday, guys like Sam Nicholson, James Keatings and Kenny Anderson came on. There are still guys like Soufian El Hassnaoui, Kevin McHattie, Jordan McGhee and Brad McKay sitting on the bench and they are all bona fide Premiership players that want to play.

‘Now the league is won, the next target is that Hearts fans are desperate to see the team score 100 goals. There are seven games left to score 16. They’ll be looking at that.’
