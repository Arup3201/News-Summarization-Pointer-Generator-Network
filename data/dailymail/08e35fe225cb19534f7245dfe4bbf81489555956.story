In her chic black quilted leather skirt and neon collared T-shirt, Princess Beatrice cut a stylish figure as she enjoyed a night out with friends at London's Cirque du Soir nightclub.

But while the ensemble looked good, was it so good that the princess chose to wear the exact same outfit for a second time 24 hours later?

The all-black outfit made its first 
appearance on Wednesday night when Princess Beatrice sported it during a
night out with a group of friends.

Hope you've got some Febreze! The ensemble appears on Wednesday night (left) and yesterday (right). Only the shoes had been changed - from high black heels to zebra ballet flats

Social life: Like her mother Sarah Ferguson, Princess Beatrice appears to have a penchant for partying

Teamed with a chic sparkling pink Anya Hindmarch clutch and a classic pair of black patent court shoes, the skirt and T-shirt combined to create the perfect party look.

And the princess clearly wasn't the only one to think so. During her time at the racy night spot, she was the recipient of numerous admiring male glances and was photographed enveloped in the arms of an enthusiastic male friend at the end of the night, who planted a kiss on the smiling princess's head.

Boyfriend Dave Clark, meanwhile, was nowhere to be seen thanks to the pressures of his work at Richard Branson's space travel company, Virgin Galactic.

The next evening, the outfit was back for an evening with Princess Eugenie and the Duchess of York, although the princess had found time to exchange her court shoes for pretty zebra print pumps.

Smiling broadly as she left members-only club LouLou's, Princess Beatrice looked remarkably fresh for a girl on a two-day party mission - even if her outfit was not.

Love: The sisters and their mother were joined by Eugenie's 27-year-old boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank

Mystery man: Glamorous Beatrice was seen cuddling up to a male friend outside Cirque du Soir on Wednesday

Not around: Princess Beatrice's boyfriend Dave Clarke was nowhere to be seen during the Cirque du Soir visit

Although it is not known whether Beatrice made it home between her nights out - whether or not she did is likely to remain a mystery - sister Eugenie didn't appear to be concerned as she sauntered out of the club on the arm of boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank.

Their mother, the former Duchess of York, didn't seem to mind either and looked elegant in a monochrome ensemble.

LouLou's is a favourite Royal hangout and is owned by Mark Birley - oldest son of Lady Annabel Goldsmith and half-brother to Richmond MP Zac.

As well as the York sisters, Pippa Middleton is regularly spotted drinking at the private establishment, and the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William were often seen leaving the club before a certain Royal baby put paid to their socialising.
