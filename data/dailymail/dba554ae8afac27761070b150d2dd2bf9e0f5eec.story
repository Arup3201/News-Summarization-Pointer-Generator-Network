A mother killed her 'evil' daughter after being turned against her by a lesbian lover who had assumed a bizarre set of male alter egos, a court heard.

Polly Chowdhury, 35, is accused of murdering Ayesha Ali - who was found at her Essex home with more than 50 injuries - together with her lover Kiki Muddar after being caught in a web of fiction.

Muddar, 43, created aliases such as 'Jimmy Chowdhury' and a spiritual Muslim named 'Skyman', jurors heard, who had sex with Chowdhury and sent her texts saying: 'Your daughter will pay'.

Aftermath: A 999 heard Ayesha was dead and that Chowdhury (above), her mother, had tried to kill herself and was in the bath. When paramedics arrived in August 2013 they discovered the girl had 50 injuries

Chowdhury held her head in her hands and wept in the dock beside Muddar as a murder trial began against both women at the Old Bailey today.

The court heard Ayesha, eight, was found dead  at Chowdhury's home in Chadwell Heath, Essex, in August 2013 after a neighbour heard 'loud, piercing, distressed screaming' earlier that month.

She had suffered more than 50 injuries to her head, body and limbs, including carpet burns and a bite mark on her shoulder.

Muddar dialled 999 to say Ayesha was dead, and that Chowdhury had tried to kill herself and was in the bath.

Paramedics discovered the body of the little girl 'cold and stiff' lying along the side of her bed dressed only in a pair of pants. The cause of her death was a head injury.

Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said: 'At the core of this case is the relationship between Kiki Muddar and Polly Chowdhury.

'To say that their relationship was unconventional is a gross understatement. It was complex and involved fictional characters.'

He said the pair had first struck up a close friendship when they lived near each other.

In 2012, Muddar moved into Chowdhury's home, forcing her husband to sleep downstairs and leading to the eventual breakdown of the marriage.

Mr Whittam said Chowdhury was turned against her own daughter by Muddar and her array of fictional characters.

One was a so-called spiritual Muslim called Skyman who only communicated by text, and the mother tried to act in a way that would 'please him', the court heard.

Chilling messages in capital letters by 'Skyman' - from Muddar's phone - were read to the court.

One read: 'Your daughter was staring at your soulmate why was she not disciplined'.

Others read 'Your daughter will pay', 'your daughter can have the pain', 'your daughter will destroyed', and 'your daughter is eveil [sic] you never disciplined her today'. 

Another read: 'You have no right to ever love or like your evil daughter'. 

The prosecutor also said Chowdhury had fallen in love with another of Muddar's fictional Facebook characters, a man named Jimmy Chowdhury.

A sexual relationship developed between the women because Chowdhury thought she was having sex with her soulmate 'through the medium of Kiki'.

But the prosecutor said: 'He is a fiction pieced together by Kiki Muddar. He existed only on Facebook, by text message or through Kiki Muddar herself.

'There was a photograph of a man she had placed on the Facebook page but that was not Jimmy Chowdhury.

In a phone call to a friend a month before Ayesha died, Muddar described the girl as a 'witch' and threatened to drown her and go to prison, jurors were told. She allegedly said: 'I'm going to go to prison tonight'

'Polly Chowdhury never met him, nor did she speak to him, yet it appears Polly Chowdhury fell in love with this fictional Jimmy Chowdhury.'

Mr Whittam said there was 'ample evidence' of Muddar's strength of feeling towards Chowdhury and her attitude towards Ayesha expressed through thousands of text messages, Facebook entries and telephone calls. 

In a phone call to a friend a month before Ayesha died, Muddar described the girl as a 'witch' and threatened to drown her and go to prison, jurors were told.

She allegedly said: 'I'm going to f****** kill her. I will drown her in the f****** bath. I will drown that witch. I'm going to go to prison tonight.'

Muddar also pretended to have cancer and blamed Chowdhury for making her condition worse, the court heard.

Added to the 'complexity', Muddar also claimed to receive text messages from a former lover who she claimed had died in the London riots.

Muddar, of Ilford, Essex, and Chowdhury, Chadwell Heath, Essex, deny murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child between March 1 and August 29 2013.

The trial continues.
