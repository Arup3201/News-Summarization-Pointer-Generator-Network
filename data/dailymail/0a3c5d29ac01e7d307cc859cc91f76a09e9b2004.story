Lethal, Brendan Rodgers called him. It’s been 153 days since Liverpool’s manager last described one of his players in such ruthless, glowing terms but 11 minutes of Daniel Sturridge brought the phrase back into his vocabulary.

It was a fitting description. Introduced as a 68th minute substitute, Sturridge made his first sight of goal since last summer count, beautifully cushioning a ball from Philippe Coutinho with his left foot before flashing a drive with his right past Adrian, the West Ham United goalkeeper.

This was the norm last year, when Liverpool were pummelling teams in pursuit of the title, but the current season had lacked a cutting edge until now. This is the kind of contest Rodgers has seen his side labour in but the introduction of leading man secured an impressive 2-0 win.

Liverpool have often flattered to deceive since Sturridge last appeared on August 31, a combination of thigh and calf problems ruining the campaigns of player and team, but if this cameo against West Ham is to be a guide, the season might yet end with a bang.

‘It was nice for him because he has been out such a long time,’ said Rodgers, who had Raheem Sterling open the scoring. ‘It is just about managing game time now, but when he gets into that area of the pitch, he is lethal. It helped us get the rewards for an outstanding performance.’

Rodgers enthusiasm was understandable. With six draws in their last eight matches at Anfield, no Steven Gerrard — rested, according to Rodgers, as a precaution due to a tight hamstring — and the lingering effects of their efforts against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup, this game had the recipe for trouble.

West Ham were aggressive from the start. Alex Song was a persistent source of irritation to Liverpool’s technical players, while Andy Carroll seemed intent on bustling Rodgers’ defenders out of their comfort zone.

This was Carroll’s first return to Anfield since Rodgers swiftly called time on his Liverpool career in 2012 and he seemed wound up by the occasion. His pre-match remarks — accusing Rodgers of ‘lying’ to him — lacked class and the same could be said of his performance.

He was fortunate to get away with clattering Emre Can with his forearm after four minutes but was eventually booked for a stupid tackle on the same player. Carroll injured himself in that moment and was promptly substituted.

‘When we had to deal with that pressure, we did,’ said Rodgers. ‘Physicality is a big part of Andy’s game but we were. Mamadou Sakho was outstanding. The team stood up to that very well.’

By the time Carroll hobbled off, Liverpool had taken the lead but the first goal should have come much earlier. Only referee Andre Marriner will know why he never gave a penalty after Joey O’Brien wrestled Sterling to the ground in first half injury time.

If that was baffling, so too was Lazar Markovic’s miss as play continued; picking up the loose ball, the Serbian dragged his shot wide from eight yards. Rodgers’ exasperated reaction spoke volumes.

Not that it mattered. Within minutes of the restart, Alberto Moreno scampered down the left and fizzed in a cross that found the twinkling feet of Philippe Coutinho. He picked out Sterling with instinctive pass and the England forward drilled his shot beyond Adrian.

Rodgers repeatedly punched the air with glee. There is no margin for error in their pursuit of a top four place and breaking West Ham’s resistance was vital. Taking the lead gave Rodgers the perfect platform to reintroduce Sturridge to a raucous reception. It got even louder when he provided the moment many had hoped for. The outstanding Coutinho set him away and he confidently manoeuvring himself into position before sweeping the ball past Adrian. Sturridge wheeled away, did that dance and Anfield came to life.

‘I’m excited about the whole collective,’ Rodgers said.

Should he keep his lethal weapon fit for the final four months, reaching the Champions League might not to be beyond the realms of fantasy after all.

Such was the relief around the stadium, every Liverpool player swarmed over to celebrate with Sterling, while Rodgers repeatedly punched the air with glee. There is no margin for error in their pursuit of a top four place and breaking West Ham’s resistance was vital.

Taking the lead gave Rodgers the perfect platform then to reintroduce Sturridge and, predictably, the acclaim he received when making his grand entrance on 68 minutes was suitably loud; 11 minutes later it had got even louder.

He had already had one sight of goal before the outstanding Coutinho set him away and he was not in any mood to blow his moment, confidently manoeuvring himself into a position before drilling his shot beyond Adrian.

Much more of this and Liverpool reaching the Champions League might not to be beyond the realms of fantasy.
