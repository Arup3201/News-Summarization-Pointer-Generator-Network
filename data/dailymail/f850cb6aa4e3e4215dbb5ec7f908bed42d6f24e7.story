Harry Redknapp secretly received transfer 'bungs' worth £189,000 in a Monaco bank account opened up in the name of his pet bulldog, a court heard yesterday.

The Tottenham Hotspur boss – tipped to be the next England manager – is accused of hiding the two 'off-the-record' payments in an offshore tax haven.

Redknapp, 64, flew to the Mediterranean principality to open the account called Rosie 47, a combination of his dog's name and the year of his birth, a jury was told.

Both payments were made in American 
dollars by Portsmouth Football Club's chairman, Milan Mandaric, when 
Redknapp worked at the club, the court heard.

But the cash was 'deliberately and 
dishonestly' concealed with the prime purpose of avoiding the payment of
tax, the jury was told.

Prosecutor John Black QC told 
Southwark Crown Court 'both parties must have known' they were avoiding 
taxes. 'These payments were a bung or offshore bonus that the parties 
had absolutely no intention of paying taxes for,' he said.

Redknapp, who underwent heart surgery 
last year to unblock his arteries, is the most successful English 
manager in the modern game. He led Portsmouth to FA Cup success and 
Spurs into last season's Uefa Champions' League. Mandaric, 73, is now 
chairman of Sheffield Wednesday, and has previously worked at Leicester 
City.

Mr Black told the court Redknapp was 
'no ordinary employee' of Portsmouth and had the 'greatest capacity to 
influence the success or failure of his football club'.

He said: 'He is currently enjoying 
football success as manager of Tottenham Hotspur. They are currently 
riding high and I think today they are placed third in the Premier 
League. Even in the early 2000s, it was obvious he was unusually 
talented.' But he added: 'Talented and popular he might have been, the 
Crown say he was nevertheless a hard-headed businessman, with a 
financial acumen and pecuniary sense of his influence to his employers.'

The court heard Redknapp had a series 
of lucrative bonuses built into his contract when he was made director 
of football at Portsmouth in 2001, including 10 per cent of any profit 
made from any players he bought and sold.

Those bonuses could total up to £500,000 depending on profits the club made from transfers.

However, the court heard that in 2002 –
when Redknapp went from being director of football to the club's team 
manager – the bonus for trading players was halved to 5 per cent.

Eight days after Redknapp joined 
Portsmouth in June 2001, England striker Peter Crouch was bought from 
Queen's Park Rangers for £1.25million.

Crouch stayed at Portsmouth for nine months before being sold to Aston Villa for more than £4million in 2002, the court heard.

The net profit of the sale was 
£2.3million, but, because of the revised terms of Redknapp's new 
contract, he was due only 5 per cent of that, which was £115,473. This 
was paid to him via his wages.

But Mr Black said the pair made an 
'off-the-record' arrangement to compensate Redknapp for taking a smaller
cut after the deal had gone through.

He added: 'It seemed clear that Mr 
Mandaric and Mr Redknapp arranged that Redknapp, in addition to being 
paid by the club any sums due to him under the new transfer bonus 
clause, would receive sums off the record.

'Such off-the-record sums would remain hidden from the UK tax authorities. That is what the Crown say is exactly what happened.'

The court heard Redknapp waited just 
four days after receiving the legal bonus from the Crouch sale before 
taking steps to ensure that he would receive 'what he regarded was his 
due'.

The court heard how he flew to Monaco 
to open the private Rosie 47 HSBC account. The prosecution said there 
was no good reason why the account couldn't have been opened in 
Redknapp's own name. It is alleged that Mandaric, a Serbian billionaire,
made two payments into the account.

The first charge relates to £93,000 
allegedly paid by Mandaric to Redknapp's account between April 1, 2002, 
and November 28, 2007, without paying NI contributions or tax. The 
second relates to £96,500 allegedly paid by Mandaric to Redknapp between
May 1, 2004, and November 28, 2007, again into the Monaco account 
without paying NI contributions or tax.

The jury has not been told why the second payment was made.

But the Monaco bank account eventually
came to light during an inquiry into illicit payments in football led 
by Lord Stevens, the former Metropolitan Police commissioner.

The results of that investigation, 
known as the Quest inquiry, was handed to the Premier League chief 
executive, Richard Scudamore, in July 2007.

Redknapp had been investigated by HM 
Revenue & Customs officials over his transfer dealings at one of his
previous clubs, West Ham United, the court heard. But he made no 
mention of the Monaco account when interviewed in November 2006. This 
probe, between January 2004 and October 2006, 'was originally prompted 
by concerns over a £300,000 payment' regarding profit made in the 
transfer of Rio Ferdinand.

Mr Black said: 'That was the first 
time anyone heard of the Monaco bank account.' He added: 'It is 
significant, the Crown suggests, that the bank account opened by Mr 
Mandaric was located in an offshore tax haven.

'The Crown suggests this was quite 
deliberate and was intended to obscure and to render less transparent 
the nature of the money payments.'

Redknapp, who lives in Poole, Dorset, 
was dressed in a dark blue suit, white shirt and tie. He had arrived in 
court with his son Jamie, an ex-player and respected football pundit.

Redknapp senior sat next to Mandaric 
behind toughened bulletproof glass in the witness box. He and Mandaric, 
of Oadby, Leicestershire, deny two counts of cheating the public 
revenue. The trial continues.
