The bodies of six climbers reported missing in the French Alps have been found.

The group was last seen leaving a mountain hut on Tuesday on route to summit L'Aiguille d'Argentière, near Chamonix.

Mountain police launched a rescue operation but efforts were hampered by the heavy rain and snow.

This morning they recovered five bodies before finding the sixth in a crevasse hours later.

All six of the dead are believed to be French.

The
 group consisted of an experienced mountain guide and five members of 
the UCPA, a non-profit French organization that sends people aged seven 
to 39 on outdoor sports holidays.

According to reports, the six people had been roped together.

The
 four men and one woman, aged between 27 and 45, and the 42-year-old 
guide, a fully-qualified salaried guide for the UCPA, had set out at 4am
 on Tuesday despite the bad weather warning.

They fell 820 feet to their deaths, according to police.

The group – on the second week of a two-week climbing course in Chamonix - had three ropes, each with two people.

Commander
 Jean-Baptiste Estachy, from the Chamonix Mountain Police said: 'They 
fell 250 metres. It would have been instant death. It was a violent 
fall.

'We believe the accident happened in the middle of the day.

'We do not yet know the cause of the accident.

'Five bodies were found this morning and the sixth was located this afternoon in a crevasse.

'The
 alert was given yesterday evening by the guardian of the refuge 
(mountain hut) where the group had been staying. He said they had been 
due to return to the hut between 2pm and 4pm. 

'He knew the guide and he sensed things were not right so he alerted the police.

'Two
 helicopter flights were made that evening to try and locate the group. 
There was a storm that night and the search was resumed again in the 
morning.'

Rescuers later found the body of the sixth member of the climbing group in a crevasse on the mountain (file picture)

The group was believed to have been on their descent from the summit when tragedy struck.

An inquiry has been opened into the accident.

It
 is the most serious accident in the Mont Blanc Massif since the 2012 
avalanche on Mont Maudit that claimed the lives of nine climbers, 
including three Britons.  

The route to the summit is considered medium difficulty and involves a mixed terrain of snow and rock.  

L'Aiguille d'Argentière is a 12,800 feet summit in the Mont Blanc massif range between France and Switzerland.

All had set off to scale the Aguile d'Argentiere with an experienced guide, but got into difficulty in poor weather conditions

The
 first ascent was by a British party comprising Edward Whymper and 
Anthony Adams Reilly with guides Michel Croz, Michel Payot and H. 
Charlet on 15 July 1864.

The route they took was via the west flank and 
the north-west ridge.

It
 has been a deadly period for Mont Blanc range.

During the last two 
weeks of July six climbers died – two from Ireland, two from Finland, 
one from Germany and one from France.

The
 UCPA was formed in 1965. It is a union of government bodies, sports 
federations and youth associations. About 250,000 people travel with 
UCPA annually.

UCPA is mainly located in France, but is also present in some fifty countries around the world.
