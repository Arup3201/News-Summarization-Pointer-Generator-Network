Getting married can be a daunting prospect, but this bride has a good reason to look terrified.. she is being chased by a menacing T-Rex.

The amusing photo is the creation of  Quinn Miller, 22, who digitally added the giant dinosaur chasing the entire wedding party out of the ceremony.

Mr Miller took the shot at the wedding of Katie Young, 23, and James Lowder, 21, from Louisiana at The Myrtles Plantation on Sunday.

He told io9.com that he had known the groom for a while and knew he was a fan of dinosaurs so he pitched the idea to him a few days before the wedding and he 'loved the concept.'

Unexpected guest: Getting married can be a darting prospect, but this bride has a good reasons to look terrified.. she is being chased by a menacing T-Rex. The amusing photo is the creation of Quinn Miller, 22, who Photoshopped the giant dinosaur chasing the entire wedding party out of their ceremony

Mr Miller does not know what the newlyweds reaction will be - they are currently away on their honeymoon. 'I don't know that I'll ever shoot a more fun wedding,' he said

Incredibly the dramatic photo - featuring 16 guests and the happy couple - was taken in just one shot at the weekend.

'They are such a fun couple and a fun wedding party that all I had to do is tell them to run away from an invisible dinosaur. And they did. We did it in one take - the entire shooting process in two minutes tops,' he told Stuff.co.nz.

'I've seen it done twice,' Miller told GoodMorningAmerica.com. 'I saw one that was kind of viral when it 
happened, but it just wasn't that great. Then I saw another one that was
 just a generic dinosaur picture with the people put into a prehistoric 
scene. But I'm really nit-picky about Photoshop.'

Mr Miller added a stock image of a T-Rex and painstakingly altered the image, before posting it on his Facebook page on Monday under the heading 'Things got real crazy at the Lowder wedding last night.'

His snap instantly went viral and has now spread across the internet, being hailed as the 'best wedding photo ever.'
