Germany has pulled off a world-first in getting blogging site Twitter to block an account to silence neo-Nazis spreading hate messages.

But while the tweets will no longer be visible to users in Germany, the rest of the world will be able to view them.

It is the first time the social networking site has implemented its local censorship policy, which came into force in January.

'Injustice': Besseres Hanover, or Better Hanover, have hit back over their tweets being censored in Germany - writing in English on Twitter, where they normally tweet in their own language

Besseres Hannover - Better Hanover - is an outlawed Hitler-worshipping group that routinely called for a Fourth Reich, the expulsion of immigrants and new round-ups of Jews. Several of its members are facing criminal charges for denying the Holocaust and promoting racial hatred.

It was police in the state of Lower Saxony who approached central government in Berlin asking it to silence the 'voices of racial abuse.'

The coalition administration led by Chancellor Angela Merkel then instructed lawyers to contact Twitter.

Twitter's chief lawyer, Alex Macgillivray, said: 'We are acting against a group deemed illegal in Germany. With hundreds of millions of Tweets posted every day around the world, our goal is to respect our users' expression, while also taking into consideration applicable local laws.

'Many countries, including the United States, have laws that may apply to Tweets and/or Twitter account content.

'In our continuing effort to make our services available to users everywhere, if we receive a valid and properly scoped request from an authorised entity, it may be necessary to reactively withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time.'

Modern technologies such as social networking sites are useful tools for German neo-Nazis, who are growing in strength on the back of the euro crisis and xenophobia stoked by Germany bearing the financial brunt of bailing out struggling countries such as Greece.

While they are severely restricted in what they can say and do in Germany, because of postwar laws designed to prevent the future glorification of the Nazis and their works, the Internet links them to literature, songs and like-minded souls across the globe where laws are not so strict - particularly in America.

The move in Germany to silence hatemongers came after a controversy over anti-Semitic tweets in France.
