David Cameron suffered a fresh set back in his bid to curb EU immigration today – after new Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker said freedom of movement should be made easier.

Mr Juncker, who became European Commission president despite the fierce objections of Mr Cameron, told one of his new commissioners to 'promote freedom of movement' within the EU.

The revelation comes as new polls suggests the public would vote to stay in the EU – even if Mr Cameron on manages to secure 'modest' changes to Brussels rules.

David Cameron has pledged to curb European immigration as part of his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with Brussels

If Mr Cameron in unable to win any changes in Britain's relationship with the EU the public will vote to leave according to a new poll

If the PM could not secure any renegotiation at all, people say they will vote to leave the EU by 42 per cent to 36 per cent.

If Mr Cameron manages to secure 'substantial' changes people say they would vote to stay in by 55 per cent to 23 per cent.

But if he can only get 'modest renegotiation' a majority of the public say they would still vote to remain in the EU, by 44 per cent to 36 per cent.

The polling gives Mr Cameron hope that even small reform to European immigration rules could be enough to win public backing to stay in the EU.

Mr Cameron has pledged to hold an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership by 2017 if he wins the general election.

He is set to outline plans to limit the number of European migrants joining the workforce within the next few weeks, according to Government sources – and is considering an 'emergency brake' that could be applied if numbers of incomers exceeded forecasts.

Further curbs on low-skilled EU migrants' rights to benefits, tax credits and national insurance numbers could also be introduced.

Outgoing European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso insisted over the weekend that an arbitrary cap on EU immigration would be incompatible with EU law.

Mr Juncker's call for EU migration to be made even easier is a further blow to the Prime Minister.

In a letter sent last month, Mr Juncker told Ms Thyssen, a Belgian MEP, that she should be 'improving the conditions for geographic and professional mobility across Europe'.

He cited the EU-wide job exchange website EURES.

Today's row comes after Mr Cameron was urged by veteran Europhile Tory Ken Clarke to ignore backbenchers using the public 'hysteria' over immigration to drive Britain out of Europe.

The former Chancellor suggested the Prime Minister should let right wing MPs defect to Ukip so the party could get back to 'common sense'. He said: 'We mustn't compete with ignorance and bigotry,'

Tory peer Lord Hill will be the EU's commissioner for financial services, overseeing banking - a post welcomed by the UK government

Mr Clarke's remarks come amid growing demands for the PM to demand a cap on the number of EU migrants allowed to move to the UK.

The new European Commission led by Mr Juncker was voted in by MEPs today.

MEPs voted 423 to 209 - with 67 abstentions - to allow the Commission to take office next month.

The Commission drafts EU laws, oversees national budgets and enforces EU rules.

Most Tory MEPs abstained from the vote. Other Eurosceptics, including Ukip, opposed the Commission, as did the Greens. But the main party blocs voted for the new team.

The 28-strong team has one official from each EU nation.

The UK's Lord Hill will be commissioner for financial services, overseeing banking - a post welcomed by the UK government. However, he had a rough ride in the hearings, as MEPs recalled him for a second round of questioning.
