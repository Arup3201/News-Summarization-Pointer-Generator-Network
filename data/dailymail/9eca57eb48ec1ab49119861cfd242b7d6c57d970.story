Batsman remains in induced coma

Stuart Broad defends Sean Abbott 

The young cricketer who delivered the bouncer that hit Phil Hughes and left him in an induced coma has received counselling as the sporting community rallies around the 22-year-old.

Sean Abbott was shocked after Hughes collapsed on the pitch on Tuesday during day one of the Sheffield Shield match between New South Wales and South Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground.

Abbott was standing right next to Hughes when he fell face first into the pitch. The 22-year-old sprung in to action and helped turn Hughes on his side as other players rushed over to assist.

Cricket Australia stressed 'no blame' was being put on Abbott.

'Abbott, along with all cricketers from both teams, have been offered counselling and support from Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA),' a statement read on their website.

Alastair Nicholson, recently appointed the chief executive of the ACA, said: 'We were obviously shocked to learn of the seriousness of the incident involving Phil. 

'While we have faith that he's receiving the best available treatment, the situation will impact his family, friends, and those directly involved on the field. 

The sporting community, including Marcus North and Brett Lee, have come out in support of Abbott

'The ACA is therefore working closely with CA to arrange the appropriate counselling for those affected. Naturally our thoughts are with him and we wish him well from all the ACA members.'

After Tuesday's incident, former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee told 9News he was concerned about Abbott, saying the New South Wales cricketer would be 'going through a really tough time'.

Lee's sentiments were echoed on social media by other sportsmen.

Cricket legend Glenn McGrath tweeted a message of support out to Sean Abbott.

'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott,' he tweeted immediately after his message to Hughes.

Another former Australian Test cricketer Marcus North called on Abbott to keep his chin up. 

'Thoughts also go out to a great young kid @seanabbott77 Stay strong mate! #CricketFamily,' he said.

Abbott made his state debut at the age of 18 and won the Steve Waugh Medal as New South Wales player of the season in 2013/14.

Last month he made his One Day International and Twenty20 debuts both against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.
