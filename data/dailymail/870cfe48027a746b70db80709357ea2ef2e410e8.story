Virgil van Dijk is a 23-year-old Dutch centre back who plays his football for Celtic. He’s been extensively scouted by a host of top English clubs.

What’s his pedigree? 

He came through the ranks at Willem II in Holland before moving to Groningen as a teenager, where he played in the same side as Southampton’s Dusan Tadic. He has played for the Dutch Under 19 and Under 21 sides and in 2013 he moved to Celtic for £2.6million. 

Virgil van Dijk is a target for Arsenal as well as several other top Premier League clubs

What kind of player is he? 

He’s 6ft 4in, so it’s no surprise to hear that he’s strong in the air. But he’s composed on the ball too. He’s particularly strong in one-on-one situations.

What else would we look out for? 

For a defender, he’s not exactly goal-shy. He’s already scored twice this season and last year hit one of the goals of the season in the Scottish Premiership, dribbling from inside his own half to score against St Johnstone.

Can he cut it at the top? 

Yes, at least according to Giovanni van Bronckhorst. The former Dutch star says Van Dijk can potentially be ‘the best central defender in Europe in the next few years.’ 

Van Dijk is used to scoring goals - his effort against St Johnstone last season was superb
