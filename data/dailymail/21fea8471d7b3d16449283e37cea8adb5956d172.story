A hypersonic SpaceLiner capable of reaching 24 times the speed of sound and transporting passengers from London to Sydney in 90 minutes could be with us by 2050.

Although the finished article is still a long way off, Martin Sippel, project coordinator for SpaceLiner at the German Aerospace Center believes the project could attract private funding within a decade.

The current concept includes a rocket booster stage for launch and a 
separate orbiter stage to carry up to 50 passengers halfway around the world 
without ever making it to space.

'SpaceLiner', capable of reaching 24 times the speed of sound and 
travelling from London to Sydney in 90 minutes, could be 
with us by 2050. It is expected to have a capacity for 50 passengers

The SpaceLiner would take approximately 
eight minutes to climb to an altitude of 50 miles where it reach 
the earth's upper atmosphere before breaking off from the liquid oxygen and hydrogen-fuelled rocket

A journey between Europe and the U.S. would be reduced to just over 60 minutes, providing passengers are happy to pay space travel prices, estimated to be in the region of several hundred thousand dollars per ticket.

Should it take off in both sense of the word, there is no reason why a fleet of SpaceLiners couldn't make up to 15 flights a day, believes Sippel.

'Maybe we can best characterise the SpaceLiner by saying it's a kind of
second-generation space shuttle, but with a completely different task,'
Sippel told TechNewsDaily.

The SpaceLiner would take approximately eight minutes to climb to an altitude of some 50 miles where it reach the earth's upper atmosphere before gliding back to Earth at hypersonic speeds of more than 15,000mph.

SpaceLiner engineers hope to use a liquid oxygen and hydrogen rocket fuel, leaving water vapour as waste.

Engineers predict that advances in materials could be combined with new cooling technologies and heat shielding to safeguard the SpaceLiner's structures against the intense heat of hypersonic flight.

The Spaceliner would likely require an 
isolated launch site and careful route planning to keep sonic booms from
negatively affecting residential areas. Here is an artist's impression of it launching from Australian desert

The Spaceliner would likely require an isolated launch site and careful route planning to keep sonic booms from negatively affecting residential areas.

The empty rocket stage from SpaceLiner would return to Earth after launch so that it could be reused.

The plan would be for an aircraft to fly out and latch on to the rocket stage before towing it towards an airfield where it could glide in to land.

Once the SpaceLiner detaches from the rocket, the plan would be for an aircraft to fly
out and latch on to the rocket mid-air before towing it towards an 
airfield where it could glide in to land

One of the stumbling blocks experienced by the design team is the exact shape of the SpaceLiner. Its shape has to tolerate the extreme heat created by gliding at such high speeds through the Earth's upper atmosphere

The glide back down will be a moment for passsengers to catch a glimpse of more familiar territory beyond the windows. Ticket prices would not be cheap and could cost several hundred thousand pounds

Touchdown. A 90 minute journey time from Australia to London would change air travel as we know it

SpaceLiner's eventually design could well be influenced by upcoming, EU-funded study FAST20XX (Future High-Altitude High-Speed Transport 20xx).

A close eye will also be on the success or failure of space ventures by the likes of Virgin Galactic. Should space travel capture the interest of travellers, Sippel is confident a fleet of SpaceLiners could make up to 15 flights a day.
