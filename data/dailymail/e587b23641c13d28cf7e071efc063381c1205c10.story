Manchester United are planning to play in a series of money-spinning friendlies across the world should they fail to qualify for Europe. 

The club is braced for a whopping £20million shortfall if they miss out on the Champions League for the first time in 19 years.

And if David Moyes - who has had a disastrous first season at the Old Trafford helm - fails to steer the club into the Europa League, the club are set to miss out on a further £5m.

And the Old Trafford hierarchy will use globe-trotting, glamour friendlies to fill weeks previously dedicated to European nights to make up the shortfall.

With the club set to rake in more than £12m from a five-game tour of the USA in summer, there is money to be made in developing markets such as the Middle East, America and India.

And with fellow giants AC Milan, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia and Lyon also struggling in their domestic leagues, Wayne Rooney - who recently signed a £300,000-a-week deal - and Co could yet be set for regular trips abroad.

In January 2008, United banked £2m when 
playing in Saudi Arabia for Sami al-Jaber's testimonial and they 
recently rejected the chance to play a lucrative friendly in Dubai 
during their warm-weather break.

The current Premier League champions currently lie sixth - a daunting 11 points off fourth place with 11 games to play. United slumped to a miserable 2-0 defeat in the Champions League last 16 by Olympiacos - the lowest ranked side in the competition.

Yet despite the contingency plan, Moyes has been told by Old Trafford chiefs  that qualification for the Europa League is a priority to boost the club's profile among its 650m global fanbase.
