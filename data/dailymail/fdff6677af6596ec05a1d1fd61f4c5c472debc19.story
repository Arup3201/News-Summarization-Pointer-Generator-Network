Opening up: Max George has revealed the real reasons behind The Wanted's split

They stunned fans when they announced this week that they are breaking up.

But now The Wanted singer Max George has opened up about the real reasons behind the split, which the group labelled temporary in their statement breaking the news, admitting that it was the growing tensions in the band that led he and bandmate Nathan Sykes to push for a break.

He told the Sun on Sunday: 'There has been a lot of tension. Our personal lives drove us apart.

'We used to be such a brotherly pact, but it started to feel like it wasn't The Wanted anymore.'

Max added that when The Wanted's manager Scooter Braun, who also manages Justin Bieber, asked the boys what they wanted to do after their tour, the divide became even more apparent.

And it was Max and bandmate Nathan Sykes who pushed for the split, despite Tom Parker, Siva Kanesawaran and Jay McGuiness' fierce opposition to the ideaÂ 

He said: 'As upsetting as it might be to some of the other guys, I have to live my life.

'Me and Nathan have been just as loyal to this project as anyone else - sometimes you just have to be realistic.'

The fact that the group were axed by 
their record label Universal also added pressure, with Max revealing the
 boys had to sit down and have an 'open and honest conversation' about 
their future without a label.

Happier times: The boys are calling it a day after four years together

Now Scooter has signed both Max and Nathan as solo artists, but Max insisted the tensions in the band won't cause difficulties when they are on tour, because all five singers are 'professional' and determined to give fans the best show possible.

Now the boys all have their own solo projects to focus on, with Max admitting he is keen to make the move from singing to acting, and has already been signed up with Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles.

And with a happy relationship with Sports Illustrated model Nina Agdal, as well as the promise of acting roles and a solo music career, Max has a lot to look forward to.

But he added of the future of The Wanted: 'We've had four amazing years. We always wanted to be the best we could so it was right to end it now after ten Top Ten single and ten million records.'

Moving on: Max is now planning to move to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career, and also has his relationship with the stunning Nina Agdal to focus on
