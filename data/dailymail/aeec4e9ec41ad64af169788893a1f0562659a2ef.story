The Germanwings A320 lost radio contact with air traffic controllers over the southern French Alps during a routine flight Tuesday from Barcelona, Spain, to Duesseldorf, Germany, before crashing, killing all 150 on board.

French officials said terrorism appeared unlikely, and Germany's top security official said Wednesday there was no evidence of foul play. 

French investigators were opening the jet's mangled black box they recovered, hoping the cockpit recordings inside would help them unlock the mystery of what caused the crash.

President Obama said on Tuesday that he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel  about the crash. The White House said he had also spoken to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to convey his condolences.

Obama called the tragedy a 'terrible airplane crash' and noted that its victims included children and infants. He spoke during an appearance at the White House with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
