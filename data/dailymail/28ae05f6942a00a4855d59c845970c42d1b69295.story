Two sharp-eyed police officers have saved the public from severe hangovers after seizing 63 goon bags of illegal alcohol.

Police found the stash of cask wine bags after receiving an anonymous call at 10.30pm alerting them to six large plastic buckets at the side Forrest Beach boat ramp, north of Townsville.

They seized the bags of 'sly grog' alcohol and searched the beach, car park and public toilets for anybody suspicious.

Police spoke to a woman sitting on the boat ramp when they arrived and subsequently spotted a tinnie about 50 metres of shore. 

Due to poor lighting, police weren't able to identify what make or model the boat was and they were unable to identify the person on board.

'Sly-grog liquor is a significant problem with the coast line area often being used in the illegal transportation of prohibited liquor into the Palm Island restricted area,' Queensland Police said.

The term 'sly grog' is an Australian colloquialism for poor quality moonshine. 

Police are continuing to investigate and say they will actively patrol the area.
