A teenager hanged himself at the same place that his father – who had shot his wife over an alleged affair – committed suicide a few weeks beforehand, a highly charged inquest heard yesterday.

Before he died, Jack Williams, 16, sent a text message to his dead father which read: 'I love you so much, Da.'

Jack had been struggling to deal with the acrimonious break-up of his parents' marriage, which culminated in 46-year-old Darren Williams bursting into his estranged wife's hairdressing salon and shooting her at point-blank range with a sawn-off shotgun.

Tragic: Jack Williams sent a text to his dead father simply saying: 'I love you Da', before he hanged himself. Darren Williams, 46, was discovered dead after shooting his wife after discovering she was cheating

He attacked Rachel Williams, 41, after
hearing she was having an affair with a solicitor, the inquest into the
older man's death was told earlier this week.

Despite being badly injured in the 
leg, she wrestled the gun from Mr Williams, a 6ft 7in, 20st former 
bouncer, who fled the scene.

Devastated: Jack is said to have attempted to stay neutral when his parents split, but was shocked when his father shot his mother then killed himself

His body was found in woodland shortly afterwards.

Yesterday a separate inquest, which 
was marred by angry scenes, heard that Jack hanged himself at the same 
place five weeks later.

His final text message was read to the hearing 
in Newport, South Wales.

It read: 'I hope where you are you can see this
message and know that I love you more than anything in this world.

'I really do hope you are at peace and
I will definitely see you one day.

'I really hope it comes soon because I
don't know how long I can live without you.'

Jack was found dead after going to 
visit the woods where his father's ashes had been scattered.

The inquest
heard the teenager had tried to 'remain neutral' when his parents broke
up.

But the hearing was told that relations between the mother's and father's sides of the family broke down after the shooting.

Police had to be called to the inquest
yesterday when insults were hurled across the courtroom by different 
sides of the family.

Officials had to restrain relatives and two men 
were escorted out of the hearing after threats of violence.

Coroner David Bowen told the court: 'I
appreciate this is a traumatic time but let us respect the boy's 
memory.'

Mrs Williams did not attend the hearing. In a statement, she 
said: 'Jack was trying to make an equal relationship with me and his 
father.

Jealous husband: Darren Williams, 45, blasted his wife Rachel, 38, with a double-barrelled shotgun in Newport. The couple are pictured (left) on their wedding day in 2005 and Mrs Williams is seen (right) in hospital

Injured: Mrs Williams wrestled the gun from her husband before he ran from the salon, the inquest heard

Investigation: Mrs Williams (pictured left in hospital) was shot at Carol Ann’s Hair Stylist (right) in South Wales

Shooting: The inquest heard that if he had not killed himself, Mr Williams would have been charged with attempting to murder his wife

'When Jack saw me in hospital after 
the shooting, he said, “I don't know why he'd do it” and we kept in 
contact by text and telephone calls.'

But the inquest heard Mrs Williams
had sent a text message to Jack, saying: 'Pack your bags and go and 
live with the hypocrites', referring to her husband's family.

The inquest heard Jack went to live 
with his father's sister, Rachael.

Her partner Wayne Davies said: 'Jack 
was a remarkable young boy who showed so much courage, dignity and 
respect and was wise beyond his years.

'He was a credit to his mother and
his father.

'But the enormity of the situation was too much for him.'

Jack's best friend, Alistair Yates, 
said: 'On the day Jack died, he said he was going to visit his dad's 
ashes.

'He said he wanted to be alone. There was no indication he was 
going to kill himself.'

Recording a verdict of suicide, Mr Bowen said: 'This s such a tragic death and his death should never have occurred.'
