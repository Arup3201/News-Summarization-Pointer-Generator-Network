The heartbroken wife of a soldier killed in Afghanistan by a roadside bomb has vowed their unborn daughter will grow up knowing about her 'loving, generous' father.

Sergeant Lee Paul Davidson of The Light Dragoons died on Sunday after his Ridgeback vehicle was hit while patrolling with the Afghan Uniformed Police in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province.

The 32-year-old leaves his pregnant wife Samantha and two sons Jayden and Jamie.

Paying tribute to her husband Mrs Davidson said: 'My gorgeous husband Lee, we all can't believe you have gone.

'You are my best friend, lover and the best husband and father I could have ever have wished for.

'You really are the total package - good looking, kind, loving, generous and the best dad I have ever known.

'Your
memories we had together will be treasured in my mind and heart 
forever, your children will grow up knowing all this about you.

'You
will never be forgotten. Never. All our love, your Samantha, Jayden, 
Jamie and your little daughter who is on the way very soon. X.'

The
sergeant's death brings the number of members of UK forces to have died
since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 427.

Light Dragoons commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Sam Plant, paid tribute to Sgt Davidson, who had also served in Bosnia and Iraq, saying: 'Sgt Davidson will be remembered as a simply superb soldier and a wonderful man.

'From the outset of training for this, his second tour of duty in Afghanistan, he demonstrated the sort of professionalism and determination that had long been his trademark.

'He was the most natural leader of men
and soldiers flourished under his command - he set the perfect tone and
example and cared deeply for his soldiers' welfare.

'Rarely
to be seen without a broad smile on his face, his enormous popularity 
was borne out of deep respect and his unbreakable sense of fun. Utterly 
loyal and ferociously hard-working, he was, and always will be, an 
inspiration to so many.

'He deployed on Operation Herrick 16 as a member of A Squadron, The Light Dragoons as a Troop Sergeant and a vehicle commander.

'In
this, his core role, he thrived from the outset but, in June, he and 
his men were selected and trained to become Afghan Police mentors.

'Typically,
Sgt Davidson attacked this new challenge with gusto, quickly proving to
be an outstanding mentor. The requirement to build rapport with his 
Afghan partners came completely naturally to him and he died doing a job
in which he was succeeding and loving. His future in The Light Dragoons
was full of promise and continued promotion up the ranks was a given.'

Sgt Davidson, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire,Â 'adored' his family and spoke of them often, the officer added.

Captain Luke Dodington, Second-in-Command, the Brigade Reconnaissance Squadron, The Light Dragoons, said: 'Sgt Davidson has been one of the most consistently excellent soldiers in A Squadron throughout training and our deployment here in Afghanistan.

'He was a driven, charismatic and caring troop sergeant who was well loved by the wider regiment, but more so by his troop.'

Warrant Officer David Rae, Regimental Sergeant Major, said: 'As a man, Davo was liked by everyone, peers, superiors and subordinates; he was easy to be around; you enjoyed spending time with him.

'There was no agenda, only a down to earth, level headed, happy, fun, chatty, articulate and intelligent Yorkshireman; and he cared about all the right things.

'His family were generally in the conversation and he doted on his wife and children. He looked upon his troop in almost equal measure and his troop knew it too...I know his soldiers are feeling this, I have witnessed it.

'I know they trusted him implicitly, I have witnessed this also.

'I know they respected him and looked up to him as the best Troop Sergeant in The Light Dragoons: it's hard to argue against this.'

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, said: 'I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Sgt Lee Davidson and my thoughts are with his family at this very sad time.

'Sgt Davidson was a respected and skilled serviceman and his loss is a great tragedy. Sgt Davidson gave his life protecting Britain's national security; his efforts will not be in vain, and he will not be forgotten.'
