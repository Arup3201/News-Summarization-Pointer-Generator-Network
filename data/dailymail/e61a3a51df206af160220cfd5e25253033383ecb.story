With his country facing ruin, Berlusconi might have been able to take his attention from women for just a short while.

But it seems that even in parliament, the 74-year-old tycoon-turned-prime minister can't resist being a ladies' man.   

Berlusconi was pictured smiling broadly as he flirted with the attractive member of parliament Michaela Biancofiore yesterday.

Blonde Ms Biancofiore, 40, gently placed her hand on Berlusconi's chest as she leaned in closely to whisper into his ear words of encouragement.

As Berlusconi began to giggle, the Italian foreign office minister tenderly squeezed his chin.

Ms Biancofiore, a member of Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, has been a long term friend of the flamboyant prime minister.

Last year she was on hand to comfort him after he was hit in the face with a metal and plaster statue of Milan's Gothic Cathedral in January 2010.

Berlusconi attended her 40th birthday shortly afterwards and seemed very amused when he presented him with a cake showing a picture of the pair of them on the campaign trail.

Ms Biancofiore is one of a coterie of extremely attractive female MPs who Berlusconi has promoted, giving them plum positions in the Italian parliament.

In an interview, she claimed that he had 'nurtured her politically.'

It's not the first time Italy's leader has been caught enjoying female attention during stuffy Parliamentary debates.

In June the renowned ladies' man was pictured having an intimate chat with Tourism Minister Michela Vittoria Brambilla.

While the lower chamber of deputies discussed crucial finance issues, Ms Brambilla sidled over to Mr Berlusconi and began whispering something in his ear.

The pair held hands during their hushed conversation, which left them both smiling.

Yesterday's romantic exchanges came as Berlusconi told parliament that Italy needed an 'immediate action plan' to relaunch growth amid concerns of a debt crisis.

Italy - which is the third largest economy in the Eurozone is facing a financial meltdown much the same as its neighbours across the Mediterranean Greece.

But even during the economic crisis the prime minister has reportedly hosted more of his infamous bunga bunga parties.

According to Italian media reports 20 women were seen entering Berlusconi's villa at Arcore last Sunday in a fleet of cars with guests not leaving until 2am.

The women are said to have 'used more caution' than normal when entering the villa so as not to attract attention although the identity of the women was not known.

Berlusconi, 74, is embroiled in allegations that dozens of showgirls were paid to attend the bunga bunga parties - which is said to refer to a crude after dinner sex act - at his luxury villa.

He is currently facing a charge of of having sex with an underage prostitute after it emerged one of the guests at the parties held last year was at the time just 17 years old.

The new allegations of sex parties came as Berlusconi today tried to reassure Italians 'there was nothing to be worried about' as the country's stock market continued to plunge.

Berlusconi, spoke out at a press conference following a crucial meeting between the government, employers' associations and unions in a bid to stop Italy from spiralling towards a Greek style debt crisis.

The meeting took place a day after the media tycoon turned politician had given a speech to parliament to calm fears that the country was heading for default.

Speaking at a press conference in Rome after the meeting he said: 'I want to tell the Italians there is nothing to worry about. Don't be frightened off the markets, keep your share certificates in your drawers.

'My speech of yesterday was not towards the stock exchange but to Italians, I wanted to reassure them and tell them not to sell their stocks if they have investments.'

However as he spoke the Milan stock exchange - despite a jump of 1.81 per cent when it first started trading, slumped 300 points or just over 1 per cent in the time that he spoke.

Berlusconi, who had failed to convince economists, newspapers and opposition politicians tried to remain upbeat - even after he was accused of lacking 'punch' in giving his speech.

He said: 'I don't think the crisis will get any worse - we should not allow ourselves to be frightened by the spreads because interest rate rises are only a fraction of the relative costs.

'The markets are only reacting to what the papers are saying but the markets are reacting for their very own different reasons and politics is not one of them.'

Bank clerk's son Berlusconi then added: 'I am the son of a father who had a long experience on the stock exchange and he said markets were like a broken watch - twice a day they give the right time the rest of the time they are wrong.'

Berlusconi spoke after the country's bond markets slumped, causing its borrowing rates to touch a record high on Wednesday but he stressed Italy could still over come the crisis despite question marks.

He added Italy and its economy were solid and that markets and speculators were to blame and the meeting was to agree a six-point plan to rescue the economy.

These included balancing the budget by 2014, reduce the cost of government, increase deregulation and privatization, unblock investments, cut red tape simplify government administration and act to boost the labour market.

However Berlusconi's hopes were not met by economic experts - Michele Boldrin, an lecturer at the University of Washington, said: 'Only a strong government can calm the markets.

'He insists that the markets are wrong and that his government has done its duty - well in that case either the markets are run by imbeciles or we can see who is really to blame from their reaction.'

Italy's national debt is currently running at 120 per cent of GDP at a trillion pounds - and last month an austerity package of 80 billion Euros worth of cuts was introduced.

Berlusconi also insisted that cuts would be made to MPs salaries and perks - Italian politicians are amongst the highest paid in Europe with a salary of around 19,000 Euro a month.

According to employers and unions, belt-tightening measures now needed to be accompanied by creating the conditions for economic growth and Berlusconi said his government would create jobs with new infrastructure projects.

Despite urging from employers and unions for immediate or at least swift action, the government said it intended to present measures in the first weeks of September.

This was greeted with disbelief by some union representatives who said that given the seriousness of the situation the country should not wait six weeks until after MPs returned from their summer holidays.

Opposition parties also remained unconvinced by Berlusconi - who is currently involved in four trials - and repeated calls for him to resign immediately.

Leoluca Orlando from the anti sleaze Italy of Values party, said: 'The European central bank is dismissing his hypocrtical optimism. While he tells the world everything is OK, (Jean Claude) Trichet says differently.

'Everyone knows that Berlusconi tells lies on a massive scale and the markets know that his government is not to be trusted and is not solid - he should do something truly patriotic and resign before Italy sinks with him.'
