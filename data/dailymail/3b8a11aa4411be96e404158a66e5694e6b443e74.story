This is one way to make sure you start married life on a high. Bride Jamie Alperin - now Jamie Lamb - and her husband David Lamb climbed 2,300 feet to reach the top of a massive rock to get married.

The couple scaled the huge peak called the Chief, near the town of Squamish in British Columbia, Canada, after Jamie decided there was no other way she would like to tie the knot.

The enormous rock formation - which is made from granite - was chosen by Jamie, 29, and David, 33, a financial advisor, after they were inspired by rock climbing pals.

Delighted Jamie said she never wanted a wedding from an early age but was inspired after watching a video from friends who staged a fake climbing wedding.

Dietician and realtor Jamie said: 'I have never wanted a wedding - even as a young girl, it just sounded expensive and more of a pain than anything else.

'A few of my friends had a vision for a company called Beyond Adventures that specialised in adventure weddings.

'They made a video that was a fake climbing wedding between some of my friends - when I saw it for the first time I cried - I loved it so much, it was incredible.

The couple spent around £7,000 on their special day, on July 22, which included buying Jamie a wedding dress that was suitable to tackle the enormous peak

'When David asked me what kind of a wedding I wanted, I simply showed him that video.

'At first, he thought he wanted the big blow out event, but as we started planning for that he realised how much stress and money went into it.

'He decided to go with the climbing wedding and it all spiralled from there.'

Jamie changed her mind about weddings after she saw a video of a staged rock climbing ceremony and decided that was the way she wanted to get married

The couple wanted to avoid the  stress and money that went into a big traditional wedding so they chose their own unique way to tie the knot

The couple said they were touched by the response they received to their wedding video from friends and even people they did not know

The couple spent around £7,000 on their special day, on July 22, which included buying Jamie a wedding dress that was suitable to tackle the enormous peak.

Jamie said the couple have been overwhelmed by the response to their unique 'dream' day.

She added: 'We've had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to our wedding.

Jamie said that it 'really touches us to know that other people could feel the emotion and love that was present on that day, and everyday, in our lives'

'Everyone says if they could do it over, they would have done it the way we did it.

'What we really wanted was to enjoy a day without all of the other drama that comes with weddings.

'An enormous amount of people have said that our video made them cry and the wild part is that people who have never even met us have said that it made them cry.
