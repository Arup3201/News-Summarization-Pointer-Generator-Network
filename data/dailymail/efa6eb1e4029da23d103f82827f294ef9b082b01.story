Afghans face death if they do not have mobile phones playing defiant Taliban ringtones and messages, it emerged today

They are being forced to show their loyalty to the insurgents at clandestine checkpoints by producing the chants romantising the war with the West.

Taliban ringtones include the titles 'Teenager', 'Doomsday' and 'Suicide Bomber'. Lyrics for Doomsday include, 'Its Judgment Day for the Satan of the West ... the evening is blazing, blazing ... '

Threat: The Taliban set up checkpoints where they test the loyalty of travellers by getting them to play insurgent ringtones and messages

For Suicide Bomber, the song 
includes the words: 'You went up into flames... You burned like a moth, 
young hero, martyrdom seeker... You are the Muslims' atomic bomb.'

The prevalence of checkpoints just an hour from the capital of Kabul, has forced many Afghans to cleanse their mobiles of all apparent Western songs and influence.

The have reported how offenders have been forced to eat SIM cards and have had phones broken on their heads..

Travellers
often pop out their real SIM cards and replace them with ones 
containing insurgent-produced jingles.

Shopkeepers are doing a roaring trade
in rebel ringtones at $2 an upload for 'emotional' songs sung by 
children with 'beautiful voices' the most popular.

Mohammad Khan said: 'If they [the Taliban] search your phone and see 
their videos and songs, they will think you are their sympathiser.

'On occasion, it can save your life.'

A member of President Hamid Karzai's government carries two SIM cards whenever he travels outside Kabul - one with all his contacts and the other for the Taliban.

He said: 'If you have Indian music or Afghan music ringtones, they will tell you that you are not obeying Islamic rules and, in most cases, break our mobiles.'

The Taliban have 40 singers that produce
on average of one 12-song album every month, a spokesperson for the 
group told the Wall Street Journal.

In the past, one of the Taliban’s most effective tools to persuade Afghans not to work with the U.S. or its allies was the night letter — a note warning people they would  be targeted for death unless they backed the jihad.

Today, the Taliban is mass texting gruesome videos to Afghans’ cellphones to spread the same message.

The insurgency’s media committee produces video glorifying suicide bombers and posts them on Taliban websites.

After watching one of them, a Paktia resident told Radio Free Europe: 'I could not even sleep because I was just thinking of this scary video in which Taliban were slaying young men.'

And while the Taliban’s ringtones echo 
from Nokias and Samsungs, Washington is reverting to a backup 
plan - wooing the Taliban with secret diplomacy to end the war.
