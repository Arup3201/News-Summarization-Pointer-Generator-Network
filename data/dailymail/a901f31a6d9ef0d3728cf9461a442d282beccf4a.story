The wife of a fraudster who pretended to be in a coma for two years wrote a stream of self-pitying letters claiming her husband was unable to move or speak and even tricked their local MP into intervening in his case.

Helen Knight wrote the letters trying to convince people that her husband Alan, 47, was in a coma as he tried to dodge court over claims he was scamming a neighbour.

She even told her local MP Geraint Davies and the local press that her only way of communicating with him was when he squinted his eyes.

Helen Knight, whose husband Alan, pictured, pretended to be in a coma for two years, wrote a stream of self-pitying letters claiming her husband couldn't move or speak 

Conman Alan Knight (pictured) of Swansea, South Wales faked that he was in a vegetative state after he scammed his next door neighbour out of £40,000

The mother-of-three from Swansea pretended her husband was in a 'vegetative state' - when in fact he was spotted on CCTV wandering the aisles of Tesco and was spotted on family holidays.

Yesterday, Knight admitted 19 charges of forgery, fraud and theft for over more than a year at Swansea Crown Court.

The court was told how he 'systematically' funnelled £41,570 out of a neighbouring pensioner's bank account which he used to pay for holidays and to buy a caravan in Dorset.

Officers tried to 'at least twice' to bring him court but each time he admitted himself to hospital claiming his condition had worsened.

Now it has been revealed that Mrs Knight, 33, won the support of their local MP Geraint Davies, who wrote to police on their behalf after her husband was accused of fraud.

The family GP also backed her claim that Knight was unable to attend Swansea Crown Court because he was in a coma.

Mr Davies, Labour MP for Swansea West, today spoke of his fury about being duped by the scammer and his wife, and called for Knight to face the full force of the law when he is sentenced.

'I went to see Helen Knight, who told me what of appeared to be on the face of it a case of police brutality against a man who was disabled by a medical condition,' he told MailOnline.

'I then made representations for them in good faith which has turned out to be a complete farbrication and hoax.

'They came up with a very detailed fantasy and spun a web of lies - and to say I'm disappointed is an understatement.

'I just hope that Alan Knight is now made an example of by the justice system.'

In letters to her local newspaper Mrs Knight begged for help in dropping her husband's case. 

She said: 'My husband is quadriplegic and in a comatose condition, bed-bound at home.

'I can tell when he is in pain because he goes very red in the face and sort of squints his eyes very tightly like a child who's going to cry. It's the only indication I get.'

But despite claiming her husband was in a vegetative state, CCTV images showed him (pictured left in a blue t-shirt) entering Tesco supermarket in Trostre, Llanelli, west Wales

Knight is now facing jail after befriending neighbour Alan Richards then taking £41,570 from his bank accounts between 2008 and 2011.

But he tried to beat justice claiming he was a quadriplegic - and was even hooked up to oxygen and had no movement from the neck down.

Mrs Knight's letters added: 'My husband has been on bail for nearly five years.

'Last night his solicitor attended my home and stated my husband must attend a hearing at Swansea Crown Court.

'They have had a recent medical letter from his GP stating very clearly as above but are not bothered.

'Obviously any movement is not possible. All involved with my husband's care are outraged.

'There has to be some sort of human rights here, but no one is taking them into consideration. And no one is listening to me.

'We have been through absolute hell and we are going through absolute hell.

'This case is ridiculous. It's dragged on too long. It's one hurdle after another.

'It's extremely hard going and it's like talking to a brick wall all the time.

'There have been continuous demands for him to attend court and they won't accept his condition. It's horrendous.

'I've told them the doctor has written to them, the MP has written to them.

'I don't feel like I'm being listened to and I don't know where to turn next.'

Meanwhile journalists who also visited the Knights' home have also told of how they too were taken in by the fraudster.

Photographer Darren Britton, who took pictures of Knight, said: 'He was very convincing - he was twitching as he was laying down in bed.

'His wife was crying, she seemed to be distraught. I had no idea he was pulling such an elaborate con trick - he has taken a lot of people in.'

Former soldier Knight claimed he went into a coma several years after breaking his neck in a fall while pulling down a garage door.

His wife claimed police dragged him out of the family home in his pyjamas and even dropped him when they lifted him from his special orthopaedic bed.

Mrs Knight claimed it left her husband in terrible pain and suffering seizures brought on by police manhandling him.

At the family home today Mrs Knight said: 'I do not wish to make any comment, thank you.'

Swansea Crown Court heard how Knight was rumbled after CCTV captured him walking around the Tesco and driving his car to Dorset.

He was seen in his car at the Severn Bridge tolls on his way home from Christhurch, Dorset, where the family have a holiday caravan.

Police also found the family's Tesco loyalty club card to trace his movements on shopping trips around South Wales and Dorset.

Judge Paul Thomas said Knight had been 'putting it on' and had 'managed to pull the wool over the eyes' of the family GP.

The judge said: 'Having seen the CCTV evidence from Tesco and driving the car I have come to the conclusion he is putting it on.

'Although a very accomplished and determined actor, he is not in the condition he claims to be.

'The conditions he claims to be suffering from are simply non-existent.'

'He has been monitored, despite attempts to maintain the fiction. He was seen wiping his face and writing things down, which are inconsistent with being paraplegic or in a coma.'

Judge Thomas added: 'Aspects of this case in my experience are unique, and a strong message needs to be sent out to anyone who seeks to adopt similar tactics.

Detective Con Paul Harry, who led the case, explained: 'In my entire career this is the most calculated, long-term deception of a vulnerable, elderly neighbour I have ever seen.

'He had constantly avoided court for two years, costing police, the NHS and the court system thousands of pounds'.

Knight was remanded in custody after admitting theft and forgery charges.

He was told he is 'likely' to be jailed when he is sentenced next month.
