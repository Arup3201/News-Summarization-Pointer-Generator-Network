Police were last night trying to stop
 Facebook vigilantes causing civil unrest after a one-month-old baby boy
 was raped and battered so badly that his heart stopped.

Messages on the social networking 
site revealed plans for a vigil near the home of the infant, who is 
thought to have suffered one of Britain’s worst cases of child abuse.

The baby’s horrific injuries were 
said to have included a broken arm, a broken collarbone, punctured lungs
 and severe bruising. It was said all of his ribs were fractured.

Care: The one-month-old boy spent time in intensive care at King's College Hospital, London, after he was admitted with horrific injuries

There was reportedly also a sexual injury and internal wounds, suggesting rape.

A man and a woman, from Gravesend, 
Kent, were arrested in connection with the incident. They have been 
released on police bail pending further inquiries.

One Facebook group called ‘Jail the 
scum who raped and beat a one-month-old baby in Gravesend’ contained 
several messages calling for the parents to be named over the alleged 
abuse.

One post read: ‘These people need to 
be locked up not given bail. They are scum.’ One  local woman said: ‘We 
feel disgusted about this and we want to express our support for the 
child. The plan is to hold a vigil this evening.’

Suspects: A man and woman who were arrested over the alleged attack are both from Gravesend, Kent

The unnamed baby was in a critical condition when taken to a hospital near his home on Thursday, but last night he was ‘showing signs of improvement’ after being transferred to a London hospital. Police forensic  experts have examined a house in Gravesend.

Neighbours said a man and a woman lived at the address with  a newborn baby.

They were described as ‘nice people, normal and polite’.

Another neighbour said she heard ‘a loud commotion’ at the house on Thursday morning.
