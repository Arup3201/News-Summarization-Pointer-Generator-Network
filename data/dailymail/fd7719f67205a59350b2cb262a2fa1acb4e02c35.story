This care-free wildebeest was photographed having the time of its life - kicking up and rolling around in the dust in its natural African habitat.

Anja Denker, 48, from Windhoek, Namibia, took these stunning images during a family holiday to Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in Botswana.

The amateur photographer, who works as a fashion designer, captured the large wildebeest having fun at a waterhole in the park.

A care-free wildebeest was photographed having the time of its live in Botswana - playing in the dirt and dust

The large animal jumped about, kicking up a storm of dust and rolling around on the ground

Anja said: 'We were standing at the waterhole early in the morning, where I was hoping to photograph some hyenas, which we had seen there previously.

'But two blue wildebeest approached the waterhole to drink. One of them suddenly started pawing the ground vigorously, kicking up loads of sand and dust. He then got down and rolled on the ground, with the dust billowing around him.'

'He got up after a while, proceeded to run around like a mad thing only to dig around in the sand again, lie down and wallow.' 

The images were taken during the photographer's family vacation to Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park

Initially hoping to spot hyenas, photographer Anja Denker soon became enthralled by the wildebeest

Anja and her family stayed for a half an hour just watching the giant animal enjoying his natural habitat

Anja and her family stayed for half an hour watching the wildebeest rolling around and playing, mesmerised by its actions.

She said: 'I always considered wildebeests pretty boring but after I witnessed this one in action so close and unexpectedly, it has completely changed my mind.

'The absolute care-free and never-minded attitude of the animal just galloping around, having fun and just living in that moment touched me deeply and also just showed me that photographing the unexpected can produce some really great results.'

'I always considered wildebeests boring,' Anja said. 'But this has completely changed my mind.'
