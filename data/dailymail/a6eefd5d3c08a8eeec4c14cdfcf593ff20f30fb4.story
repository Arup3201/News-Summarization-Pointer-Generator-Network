West Ham ace Diafra Sakho has revealed he had to ask Ricardo Vaz Te what 'he scores when he wants' meant after the song was directed at the Senegal international during his side's win against Manchester City.

Sakho has been in a rich vein since joining the Hammers in the summer from Metz in a deal worth £3,5million. 

The 24-year-old has scored seven goals in eight  games - including what turned out to be a winner against City - which has already made the forward somewhat of a crowd favourite at Upton Park.

'I didn't understand it at the beginning, but I asked Ricardo Vaz Te and he translated it for me,' Sakho told West Ham's official website.

'I'm really touched by them saying that all the time. It makes me happy to hear that and gives me even more motivation to score. I'll always try to give them that, if I can.'

Sakho believes his side can follow up their impressive 2-1 victory against Premier League champions Manchester City by stringing a run of wins together in their upcoming games.

'The run goes on for all of us, the whole team,' he added. 'We know that after Saturday there's still a long, long way to go - as I always say - but we're trying to bag all the points that we can. 

'We're trying to keep it going and that's really pleasing. My team-mates on Saturday inspired me and so I dream big. When it ends, I'll accept that. But we're going to slog away to continue it. 

'Saturday was great. To play at home in front of our fans, that spurs us all on to aim high and we'll carry on right until the end so that it will be the stuff of dreams for all the fans who came to watch us every week.'
