Britain is among the least active nations in Europe despite being one of the most diet-obsessed, according to a survey.

Asked whether they regularly practised a sport, only a fifth of respondents in the UK said yes, compared to well over half in Denmark and Holland. Only Poland is less active.

However, few watch their waistline more closely than a Briton, with 17 per cent of UK respondents claiming to have followed a slimming diet in the previous six months.

Phew! Asked whether they regularly practised a sport, only a fifth of respondents in the UK said yes, compared to well over half in Denmark and Holland. But few watch their waistlines as much as Britons

This was higher than all other countries except Denmark (23 per cent) and more than double the number in Germany, where the response was just 8 per cent.

The British obsession with dieting dates back centuries. Lord Byron, the 19th century poet, was a devotee of a fad diet involving eating potatoes drenched in vinegar.

One of the first low-carbohydrate diets was published by William Banting, a formerly obese London undertaker, in 1863.

‘Banting’ was a synonym for dieting in the UK as well as America well into the 1920s.

The current most popular diet in Britain is the 5/2 diet, which involves severe calorie restriction for two days a week. It was devised in the UK and has since spread to the US and Europe.

The survey, conducted by Spanish bank BBVA, involved 15,000 people across 10 European countries and also questioned respondents on values and world views.

It concluded that people in the UK felt significantly less part of Europe than other countries.

Britons were found to place greater importance on having a job with a high salary rather than a good work/life balance, where the opposite was true in countries such as Spain and France.

Of those surveyed, nearly half of respondents in the UK considered the offer of good pay as being the most important aspect of a job.

The survey concluded that Europeans rate family as the most important thing in their lives.

█ US scientists have uncovered a genetic link to obesity.

The researchers ‘deactivated’ the Mrap2 gene, which regulates energy use, in mice and found that the rodents put on weight even when eating the same amounts as a control group.

Some people with severe, early-onset obesity have mutated versions of the gene.
