Sony emails leaked on Friday reveal the tumultuous relationship between Sony Chair Amy Pascal and writer Aaron Sorkin. 

In fact, after one tense exchange between the two over what screenplay he would work on next for the studio, Pascal emails a few of her fellow executives saying that Sorkin is 'broke' and implies he is 'sleeping with' the author of a new book he wants to adapt into a screenplay.

That author is Molly Bloom, the poker princess who was busted by the Feds after hosting games that included Hollywood A-listers such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Tobey Maguire, men she all name checked in her novel Molly's Game

The problems between Pascal and Sorkin, who has a long history with the studio after writing The Social Network, Moneyball and the  upcoming film Jobs for Sony, seem to stem from the fact that he does not want to write the script Pascal would like him to.

The emails, obtained by Defamer, show that Pascal wants Sorkin to adapt the Michael Lewis book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt for the studio, while he would rather work on Molly's Game.

Sorkin's major problems with Flash Boys, according to his emails, are that there is little plot and the main character is Asian and 'there aren't any Asian movie stars.'

Making matters worse is that the Jobs film, for which he wrote the screenplay, was falling apart at the same time, with director David Fincher dropping out and DiCaprio and Christian Bale refusing to star.

Sorkin, as revealed in previously leaked emails, was also upset that Michael Fassbender had been given the title role. 

What angers Pascal is when Sorkin's agent, Ari Emanuel, emails to say the writer will be passing on Flash Boys in favor of adapting Molly's Game - and shopping it to other studios.

That email came on November 13, one day after Deadline broke news of the story.

This after Sorkin was apparently paid for Flash Boys, and the studio gave him millions for his Jobs screenplay.

That is when Pascal emailed Doug Belgrad, president of Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, as well as Michael De Luca and Hannah Minghella, the co-presidents of production at Columbia.

She wrote; 'He is broke… He wants to get paid… We paid him his insane fee on flashboys… When the poker movie came around we didn’t want to not be in Aaron business so we wanted that too… I don’t care if Aaron is sleeping with the girl or not… I don’t care if it becomes a beat seller… They are treating us like sh*t.'

The way they were: Sorkin and Pascal are close as he has written numerous screenplays for the studio, including The Social Network and Moneyball

The timing of this email release could not be worse for Pascal, as Sorkin just voiced his support for the studio head.

'Amy knows more than a lot of people what it's like to battle stereotypes. She's a woman at a large corporation who worked her way from assistant to the chairman's office,' Sorkin told The Hollywood Reporter. 

'No one in the world feels worse than she does right now, and the thing about Amy's character is that it's not because she was caught, it's because she did it. 

'Amy would rather cut off her own hand than intentionally hurt someone.'

Pascal has yet to comment on this latest leak.
