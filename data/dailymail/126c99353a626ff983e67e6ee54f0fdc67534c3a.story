A plan to pay £1,000 ‘bonuses’ to  Special Constables has been branded ‘policing on the cheap’ and a cut-price way to fill the gap created by the loss of 10,000 full-time officers.

At present Special Constables - volunteers often with other jobs - only receive expenses.

The Home Office hopes that by allowing local forces to make the bonus payments it will help them recruit more Specials.

Dispute: The chairman of the Police Federation Specials working group said the plan could be an attempt to fill gaps which should be taken by regular officers

But Andy Fittes, chairman of the Police Federation Specials working group, said: ‘Our fear is this could be policing on the cheap, trying to fill gaps which should be taken by regular officers.’

In some areas, Specials, along with civilian Police Community Support Officers, already make up the majority of key town centre patrols on busy Friday and Saturday nights.

They are trained and have the power of arrest but are less experienced than regular officers, and may have work commitments that mean they have to cancel shifts at short notice.

Mr Fittes added: ‘When you start to rely on a group of people who have day jobs, you could have a scenario where no one turns up. It’s nothing to do with them as individuals or their training – it’s just they have a job outside the force.’

Adam Simmonds, crime tsar for Northamptonshire, believes the bonus plan would transform policing, especially in rural areas.

Replacements? The plan comes ahead of a report which will warn that cuts are threatening the survival of the traditional beat bobby

He said: ‘Specials are the only realistic way to bring the village bobby back as a familiar trusted face, stopping the police from being a remote bureaucracy for many rural people.’

But James Deller, secretary of the Association of Special Constabulary Chief Officers, said: ‘Specials are members of the public keeping their neighbourhoods safe. If you start paying people, will you get a different person coming forward?’

The plan comes as a major report due to be published tomorrow warns that cuts are threatening the survival of the traditional beat bobby.

The study, commissioned by Labour and produced by former Met Commissioner Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, will say that 10,000 frontline officer posts have been lost as a result of a 20 per cent cut in force budgets since the 2010 Election.

It will also say that police are only now reacting to crimes rather than preventing them, as ‘bobbies on the beat are disappearing’.
