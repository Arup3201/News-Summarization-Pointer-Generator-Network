Remote Russian roads don't have rules, you've just got to reach the other end.

And in this amusing video, one daring driver decides to play chicken - with a tank.

Singing 'We are going to crash head on, go,' as he approaches the behemoth of a tank, it's really heart-in-the-mouth stuff.

The driver is full of confidence that he will win this game of 'chicken' with the army tank

And he is proved right, as the tank turns sharply off the dirt track and onto the scrubland

The tank makes a turn just in time as this shot shows how close the two came to a crash

But some 20 or so yards ahead, the truck takes a left, and out of the way of the brave (and perhaps a little erratic) car driver.

'Ha, scared,' yelps a more-than-pleased driver, before uttering the word of the game we all knew he was playing; 'chicken.'
