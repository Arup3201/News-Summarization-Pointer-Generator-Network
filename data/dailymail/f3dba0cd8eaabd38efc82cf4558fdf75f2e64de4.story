Crammed into tiny cages and barely able to breathe, hundreds of dogs are pictured packed into a truck in China destined to be served to diners at some of the country's dog meat restaurants.

But the dogs, which were spotted in Guiyang in China's Ghizhou province, were saved by animal activists thanks to a rallying call on a social networking site made by a passing driver.

The quick-thinking motorist, appalled at the site of the truck driving along one of the province's main highways, took pictures of the truck and posted them on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.

Horrific: The truck carrying dogs destined to be served in restaurants in China was spotted on the highway in the Ghizhou province

Shocking: The animals were destined for the dinner table in restaurants in China before a motorist spotted the truck and alerted animal activists via Weibo

He wrote: 'Many of the dogs are dying, and some have died. Please help!'

Some animal lovers who spotted the driver's post immediately took to the road to intercept the lorry while others put in calls to police.

Officers were able to track down the lorry and stopped it at the next toll gate.

The truck was then taken to a nearby police station and as word of the incident quickly spread online, more animal lovers turned up to help care for the dogs.

The trade and transportation of animals in China has long been a subject of contention and has prompted criticism from western animal activists.

Some of the huge markets which sell dog meat for human consumption came under scrutiny several years ago when they were suspected as the origin of the SARS virus.

In one of the huge markets on a 60 acre site in Guangzha, cages packed with dogs are piled high.

When a sale is agreed the dogs are reportedly bludgeoned until they are close to death and then handed over to the buyer.

Last year a group of animal activists were unsuccessful in their bid to stop a truck contaning some 500 dogs which was spotted at a service station on the Jingha Highway after they were attacked by thugs.

Another group was more successful when a truck with 505 dogs packed inside was stopped in Yunnan province.

Although the Chinese were the first t domestic dogs and keep them as pets, they have been consumed as food in the country for thousands of years.
