Cazine McCarthy is warning women about the dangers of sending intimate pictures to their boyfriends after her former partner posted an explicit photo of her when she dumped him

A woman whose boyfriend took revenge on her when she dumped him by posting an intimate video and image of her in her underwear online has warned women about the danger of sending racy photos to their partners. 

Nathan Lloyd, 22, posted a picture of his former girlfriend Cazine McCarthy, of Haverfordwest in Wales, on her Instagram account and then changed her password so she could not remove it. 

He had received the photo from her when they were still together, along with an intimate video which he also shared online.

Miss McCarthy, a mother of one, has spoken out about the incident for the first time to warn other women about the dangers of sending explicit photographs in what she described as a 'moment of madness.' 

She said: 'I sent a video and image of myself to Nathan because he was working away and kept asking.

'I was unsure at first but he reassured me. He said I could trust him and that he would never show anyone else.

'Looking back it was stupid and I'd never do it again.

'Women have to protect themselves. Not knowing where my picture has been shared is so frightening.' 

Revenge porn involves ex-partners uploading sexually explicit content of their lovers without their permission and legislation is currently going through Parliament to make it a criminal offence. 

The image and video of Miss McCarthy were only removed from Instagram after Miss McCarthy's friends reported it hundreds of times.

She added: 'I've lost total control. 

'Looking back I wouldn't have sent him the photo or the video but I can't change what happened.

'What I can do is discourage other young women from making the same mistake.

'Even if you think you love and trust someone you don't know how they will react when you break up.'

During their relationship he had taken note of her passwords for her social networking sites so he could check up on her. He also followed her into town on a couple of occasions. 

Miss McCarthy then decided to end her relationship with him because he was 'aggressive and controlling.'

Lloyd then used this knowledge to post the intimate picture on her Instagram account and change the password so she could not remove it. She begged him to take the messages down but he refused, responding with abusive messages. 

Miss McCarthy was horrified when she found a picture of her in her underwear had been posted on her instagram account, along with an explicit video, and her password changed by former boyfriend Nathan Lloyd

Miss McCarthy added: 'His possessive behaviour gave me the creeps. But breaking up with him only made it worse.

'He turned nasty and uploaded the private images I'd sent him as revenge.

'When I protested he showed up at my house and kicked down my door.

'That's when I called the police.'

Lloyd admitted breaking the Telecommunications Act by posting the image and criminal damage and was given a restraining order.

He was also ordered to attend a 'building better relationships' course to learn about aggression and relationships - avoiding a prison sentence. 

Miss McCarthy said the picture and video made her clearly identifiable and she feared her followers on Instagram thought she wanted them to see her baring all. 

She said: 'I would never have thought that that brief moment of madness back then would have caused me so much grief and heartache.' 

'I know people locally are talking about me and everyone knows what happened.

Miss McCarthy fears people thought she shared the image on purpose and people are talking about her

'I keep thinking that people might have screengrabbed the video and shared it with friends.

'You can see my face in the picture but not in the video.

'Everyone knew it was me though because of the tattoo on my right side and it's obvious that I was recording in my house.

'I couldn't even deny it.

'What's worse is that my followers would have thought I wanted them to see me naked.

'It was mortifying.'

The picture and video were finally taken down from Instagram after reporting it as 'inappropriate or offensive' hundreds of times.

Lloyd was also given a 'Building Better Relationships' order for 24 months and ordered to pay costs totalling £145.

In December the CPS launched new guidelines on tackling domestic abuse which will include using technology to inflict misery on former partners. Under the new guidance issued prosecutors will be encouraged to consider how revenge porn can be treated as a form of domestic abuse.

Luke King was jailed for posting the explicit image

Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws.

It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament.

It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. 

Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught.

Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet.

Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images.

The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.

However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. 

Last year Luke King, 21, of Nottingham, became the first person to be jailed for revenge porn offences in the UK. After his three-year relationship ended he posted a number of explicit images of his former partner, and changed his WhatsApp icon to one of the images.

King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images and was jailed for 12 weeks.
