These pets may all be pug-ugly - but only one will hound out the competition to be crowned the ugliest dog in all the world.

The rough-looking animals - all of whom have been certified 'naturally ugly' by their vets - will fight it out in California to receive the dubious honour of first place at the World's Ugliest Dog Contest.

Judges will decide this Friday which of the animals - with their toothy smiles, crazed hair and wild expressions - is the most displeasing of all, netting the proud owners a $1,500 prize.

However, organisers insist the event is 'not about making fun of ugly dogs' - but a fun way to showcase beloved pets who don't meet traditional standards of beauty.

The contest, now in its 26th year, is held annually at the Sonoma-Marin Fair in California.

Contestants are judged in four main categories - first impressions, unique features, personality and audience reaction.Â

A spokesman for the event said: 'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the contest has been a testament that all dogs do not have to meet pedigree standards to be man's best friend.

'The owners of all kinds of dogs are also all kinds of people - from youngsters to senior citizens, each proud of their pet despite missing fur, being crossed eyes, waddling like a duck or having mismatched ears.

'The World's Ugliest Dog Contest is not about making fun of ugly dogs but having fun with some wonderful characters and showing the world that these dogs are much loved and beautiful creatures.

'The winning dog becomes an instant celebrity with international attention.

'The owner can expect to be invited on national television shows and to be guests at all kinds of events, bringing attention to loving and rescuing dogs who are not always the first chosen.'

Chasing fame: Apparently international celebrity awaits the winners of the contest, which could include Rue, left, or Boogie, right

Heartwarming: Contest organisers emphasised that the owners all loved their pets regardless of their unusual features

Sense of humour: The owners clearly enter their pets to the competition lightheartedly, as shown by names for their dogs such as Rascal, left, and Quasimodo, right
