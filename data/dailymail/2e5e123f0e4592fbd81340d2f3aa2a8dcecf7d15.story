Anderson will face Australian judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis on Friday when he could be hit with a four-match ban — which England would almost certainly appeal against.

Senior figures inside the England dressing room believe Anderson has been the victim of a calculated witch-hunt in an attempt to destabilise the team.

England’s players have been instructed
 by ECB lawyers not to speak publicly about the allegations that 
Anderson pushed Ravindra Jadeja.

But one dressing-room insider told the Mail on Sunday no-one in the 
England team even knew an altercation had even taken place until four 
days later when the ICC announced the charges.

India
 coach Duncan Fletcher — who coached England for seven years — was at 
the forefront of ensuring Anderson was reported for the confrontation, 
which India claim occurred in the pavilion during the lunch interval on 
day two after the players left the field in the first Test.

One
 witness told the Mail on Sunday: ‘It has all been blown completely out 
of proportion. No-one close to them as they were leaving the field even 
knew there was a coming together. Even if something did happen it was 
incredibly trivial.’

England
 remain deeply suspicious of Fletcher’s motives, with several in the 
dressing room believing the allegations against Anderson stem from 
bitterness over the way he was treated by the ECB at the end of his 
coaching tenure.

Dhoni 
insisted on Saturday he had no reason to lie about the incident but both 
parties cannot be right.

England have enough problems on the field 
without losing their senior bowler for the last two Tests and, with a 
cloud hanging over him at the Ageas Bowl, it will be fascinating to see 
if Anderson can shrug off the unwanted attention.

‘Obviously
 it’s a distraction with that looming over him,’ said Alastair Cook. 
‘But he’s a very senior, experienced guy who’s been through a lot. I’ve 
got to make sure he’s okay.’
