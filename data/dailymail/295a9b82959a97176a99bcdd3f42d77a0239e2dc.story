The cash bonanza from the Premier League’s new TV deals is going where everyone expected - the players’ pockets - with experts Deloitte saying the total wage bills for the 20 clubs rose over £2BILLION last season.

When costs for non-playing staff are removed that works out at something likely to be slightly more than £2.5m per season per man.

And as the rich get richer, the gap to the rest of football has got bigger, with Championship clubs suffering a double whammy of lower income and higher wage costs at the same time, meaning bigger losses.

The top of the tree: Manchester City won the Premier League title after a hard-fought campaign

Deloitte’s annual report considers in detail the season for which full financial accounts are all available, the 2012-13 campaign, but crucially also forecasts what has happened in the season just finished.

Premier League income for all clubs combined grew to £2.5bn in 2012-13 and that will have leapt to £3.2bn by 2013-14, Deloitte say, thanks to the new 2013-16 TV deals with Sky and BT sport.

Wage costs were £1.8bn in 2012-13, or almost 72 per cent of income, and these are believed to have jumped a massive 22 per cent to £2.2bn in 2013-14.

On Championship clubs, the report says: 'The 2012/13 season was a particularly bleak year for the finances of Championship clubs. A revenue reduction of £39m was compounded by a £40m increase in wage costs, leading to record operating losses of £241m. Pre-tax losses also increased by £170m, equivalent to an additional £7m per club, to £323m.

Adam Bull, Senior Consultant in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: 'The 2012/13 wages to revenue ratio for Championship clubs of 106 per cent is the highest ever recorded by an English division and is clearly unsustainable without ongoing owner support.

'The introduction of the Championship Financial Fair Play Rules was widely seen, and advocated by the clubs who voted it in, as a necessary step to change clubs’ behaviour. The severity of the punishments applied to those who have not complied with the rules in the 2013/14 season and the eventual result of efforts to change the rules, will determine the extent to which they present an effective deterrent to widespread overspending.'

Other key findings of the Deloitte Annual Review of Football Finance 2014 include:

Premier League clubs generated the highest revenue (£2.5 billion) of any league in Europe in 2012/13, followed by Germany (£1.7 billion), Spain (£1.6 billion), Italy (£1.4 billion), and France (£1.1 billion);

The Bundesliga remained Europe’s most profitable league with operating profits of £226m, followed by the Premier League, with operating profits of £82m;

Average league capacity utilisation at Premier League clubs of 96% in 2013/14 was the highest level recorded in Premier League history and the 17th  consecutive season above 90%; 

The top 92 English clubs invested £211m in stadia and facilities in 2012/13, the highest amount of capital investment since 2006. Capital investment by clubs across the top four divisions since the Premier League began has now exceeded £3.5 billion;

Net debt in respect of Premier League clubs was £2.5 billion, an increase of £139m (6%) on 2012;

The Government’s tax take from the top 92 professional football clubs was around £1.3 billion in 2012/13.

Of the £2.5 billion net debt in the Premier League, almost two thirds (£1.6 billion) is in the form of non-interest bearing ‘soft loans’ of which over 90 per cent related to four clubs - Chelsea (£984m), Newcastle United (£266m), Queens Park Rangers (£166m) and Aston Villa (£72m).
