It is the BBC’s only show dedicated to skiing - but it appears to have become all talk and no snow.

Viewers have complained that Ski Sunday, which first aired more than 30 years ago, features hardly any of the actual sport and lots of presenters ‘chatting’ instead.

The BBC2 series presented by Graham Bell, who competed at five Winter Olympics, and Ed Leigh on Sunday nights is a far cry from the series that first aired in 1978, which concentrated on the competitive events.

It now includes other sports such as mountain climbing and speed skating and discussions as well as segments about other winter sports.

But fans of the sport are getting fed up with the other distractions and took to the BBC’s website to register their annoyance.

Writing on the BBC’s message-board, one commented: ‘Does anyone agree with me that there is too much talk and not enough skiing shown in Ski Sunday.’

Another said: ‘Since it has changed to the new format there is too much chat.‘

One added: ‘I wouldn’t say the programme wasn’t long enough... just that there isn’t enough skiing in it.’

Others specifically criticised the focus on other sports and one said the show was being ‘constantly messed around’ with and ‘spoilt by management’.

It was claimed that there had been less than 10 minutes of actual competition during the 45-minute show.

But others defended the presenting team. One said: ‘Ed and Graham are great presenters. The BBC should use them for lots of other things. Very easy to watch and they appeal to all ages and both sexes.’

Last year the presenters of the programme were reprimanded for wearing ski-wear brands they endorse.

Former Olympic skier Mr Bell and Mr Leigh appeared on screen sporting logos for Oakley and Nevica – brands they had at the time, or previously, been paid to promote.
