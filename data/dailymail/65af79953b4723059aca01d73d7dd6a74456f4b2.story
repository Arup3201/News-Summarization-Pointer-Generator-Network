Police were called to a home at Reynella East, south of Adelaide, early on Monday after paramedics reported that a man had been set on fire.

The 19-year-old man was at a friend's house when he allegedly asked to be wrapped in paper towel and set alight.

'This is a stark reminder that if you participate in these Jackass stunts, you may end up on the wrong side of the law,' Chief Inspector Ashley Gordon said.

'Don't be fooled into thinking that if you've got permission you'll be protected from criminal charges you won't.'
