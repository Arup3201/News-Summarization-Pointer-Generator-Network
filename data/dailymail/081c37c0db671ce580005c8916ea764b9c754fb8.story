This was not how she would have imagined spending the eve of her husband’s 45th birthday.

Instead of wrapping his presents or sorting out a party, Corinna Schumacher yesterday prepared to spend a fifth day at his bedside in intensive care.

Mrs Schumacher looked pale and drawn as she arrived at the hospital in Grenoble where Formula One star Michael is fighting for his life.

Ralf Schumacher, brother of the retired Formula One racing driver and his father Rolf Schumacher, leave the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire

He
 had a brain haemorrhage after falling and hitting his head on a rock 
while skiing off-piste in the French resort of Meribel on Sunday.

He remains in an artificial coma to limit damage to his brain.

Mrs Schumacher, 44, has been joined at the hospital by Schumacher’s brother Ralf and father Rolf, as well as her own mother. 

The couple’s children Gina-Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, have also spent hours at their father’s bedside. Schumacher’s manager, Sabine Kehm, said: ‘Corinna, of course, is really not good.

‘But she is trying to be strong for Michael, to give him support and not allow negative thoughts to reach him. She’s so strong.’

Mrs
 Schumacher, who has shown unwavering support for her husband in their 
18 years of marriage, was said to be struggling with his battle to 
survive.

The 44-year-old has kept a vigil at her 
husband’s bedside at Grenoble Hospital since his 
horrendous skiing accident on Sunday morning in the French resort of 
Meribel.

Her comments came as a German newspaper claimed Schumacher was trying to help out a child in trouble on the slopes when he
 lost control of skis and smacked his head on a rock.

Mrs
 Schumacher was last night seen in public for the first time since the 
accident leaving a restaurant in Grenoble looking tired and fragile.

Wearing
 a thick white scarf tied in a large knot and a dark jacket, she had her
 hair pulled back and there appeared to be dark circles around her eyes.

It
 is believed she was persuaded by family and friends to have a break 
from the hospital to 'recharge her batteries and take a deep breath'.

She has surrounded her dangerously ill husband with 
keepsakes from their children and candles as she prays for his recovery.

Among
 them is the ceramic amulet she gave him after they wed 
in 1995, inscribed with the initials of family members. Schumacher is said to have refused to race without it.

Schumacher remains 'stable' but was still in a critical condition after four nights in hospital battling severe brain injuries.

Today,
 Germany's Bild newspaper said Schumacher, 44, was with friends, their 
children and his own 14-year-old son Mick when he stayed behind the 
group to look out for the youngsters in an off-piste area.

The paper said he was using rented skis, adding: 'Suddenly the daughter of a friend crashed. 

'Schumi
 helps the girl, leaving the groomed area and moves about 20 metres in 
the deep snow between the slopes Biche and Mauduit.'

The rental skis 
have been seized by police to see if they were in any way defective.

Bild speculated that Schumacher was distracted because he was 
irritated by the binding on one boot and was unable to break his fall 
with his hands.

Former Formula One champion Niki Lauda, who himself suffered severe injuries in a 1976 racing crash, has also come out in support of Michael Schumacher.

The three-time champion (pictured, above, with Schumacher in 1995) suffered severe burns and nearly died after breathing in toxic fumes when his Ferrari burst into flames at Germany's Nurburgring.

He said: 'I think there is someone up there who is trying to help him in this situation.

'At the time, I could help myself. Michael, though, cannot do anything for the moment,' he said in an interview with the Die Zeit weekly.

The paper reports that both sides 
of the groomed slopes are marked with flags and that the accident 
occurred between 10.50am and 11am - around a quarter of an hour 
earlier than previously thought.

According to Bild, the helicopter
 which airlifted him to safety on Sunday made a stop en-route to the 
hospital to insert a tube to allow him to breathe more easily. 

The 
doctors at the first hospital noticed the bruising and bleeding on the 
brain and ordered the helicopter to take him to Grenoble where he was 
placed in an artificial coma.

An eyewitness has claimed that 
Schumacher struck a boulder and was sent flying into three other rocks 
with such force that it broke his helmet in two.

Pictures show bloodstains in the snow at the spot where the former F1 ace smashed his head after being 'catapulted' headfirst.

According
 to the first ski patrol paramedic on the scene, Schumacher hit a 
boulder which was concealed by snow that had fallen the night before and
 then struck three more rocks.

The
 French national, who asked not to be named, said: ‘We arrived within 
two minutes of the accident. The man lost control after hitting a rock 
that was lightly covered with snow.

'He
 went into the air and he fell and hit three more rocks on the way down.
 There was a lot of blood  around the last rock where he hit his head.

'The helicopter, which was able to land within 30 metres of the accident, came within minutes.’ 

He added: ‘Everyone in the resort is extremely sad  and we’re praying he comes through this.'

There
 have been reports that Schumacher had been travelling at up to 60mph 
when he crashed, but Miss Kehm denied this, describing what happened as 
‘extreme bad luck and circumstances’.

Kehm
 added that the accident could have happened even 'at 10 kilometres (six
 miles) per hour' and took place during 'a normal turning manoeuvre'.

She added: ‘He was not at high speed. He had helped a friend on the piste and then started again.

'He
 hit a rock he hadn’t seen when he went to do a curve and he was 
catapulted in the air and apparently, head down, hit another.' 

A two-pronged police inquiry has been launched, conducted by the prosecutor in Albertville.

The gendarmerie there is investigating the circumstances of the accident and will collect witness statements.

Mountain police in nearby Bourg-St-Maurice will collect technical data such as weather conditions, snow depth and quality.
