Men who read tabloids are more likely to check their testicles for signs of cancer than broadsheet readers, new research shows.

Single men are also less likely to recognise the signs of testicular cancer than men who are in a relationship.

And, office workers are the least likely to check their testicles for lumps.

New research shows that two thirds of men do not know the signs of testicular cancer

The survey of 3,000 men, carried out for the male cancer charity Orchid, aimed to find out how ‘in touch’ men are with their testicles.

It revealed that a worrying two thirds of men in the UK don’t know how to recognise the signs of testicular cancer.

It also showed that one in three men would tell their mother or partner if they found a lump, but that they wouldn’t visit a GP.

Finally, it revealed that men in London are the least ‘ball aware’ of all men in the UK.

Orchid Chief Executive Rebecca Porta said: ‘Awareness of testicular cancer has significantly improved over the past few years, but these findings also illustrate that a large percentage of men are still not taking proactive steps to protect themselves.

‘If caught early, testicular cancer can be 98 per cent curable. Sadly, our findings indicate that men who delay seeking an early diagnosis may risk the disease spreading and a poor response to the treatment.

‘We were particularly surprised to find that men working in an office environment with easy access to the internet, social media and a wide range of health information tools were least likely to check themselves.

‘We’re calling on men across the UK to take a few minutes to learn about how to carry out simple self-checks and to recognise the early warning signs and symptoms, regardless of their work obligations and pace of life. The earlier they act, the better the outcome.’

The most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in one of the testicles.

Other symptoms can include pain in a testicle, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, a dull ache in the lower abdomen, fatigue and generally feeling unwell.

Testicular cancer is uncommon and usually only affects men between the ages of 15 and 44.

It only accounts for one per cent of all cancers that occur in men.

It is one of the most treatable types of cancer with more than 85 per cent of men with early stage testicular cancer being completely cured.

Even in cases where the cancer has spread outside the testicles, there is about an 80 per cent chance of complete cure.

To encourage men to be more informed about male cancers, Orchid is launching its confidential, freephone National Male Cancer Helpline on April 7, 2014.

The Helpline is staffed by male cancer specialists every Monday and Wednesday from 10am until 5pm and can be reached on 0808 802 0010.

They can also be contacted by emailing helpline@orchid-cancer.org.uk
