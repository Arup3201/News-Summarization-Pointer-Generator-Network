Hundreds of Paris St Germain football fans were involved in fights with the police last night as a victory celebration turned into a riot.

The team, including former England captain David Beckham, looked on in horror as their celebration of winning the league title descended into fighting and vandalism.

Shops were looted, cars burnt out, and passers-by threatened by hooded youths during confrontations between hooligans and CRS riot police, who used tear gas and baton charges against the thugs.

There were 21 arrests connected to the riot, with 30 people seriously injured, including three police officers.

It began well, with people celebrating on the Champs Elysee avenue in Paris after French L1 football club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) defeated Lyon to win the French title.

‘It’s absolute pandemonium,’ said 
eye-witness Paul Reeve.

‘There are gangs of hooligans everywhere, 
targeting whatever they can. This isn’t about football – it’s about mob 
violence.’

‘The Champs Elysee is a battlefield,’ said a photographer who captured images of the violence.

‘There are youths smashing shop windows and stealing everything they can. They are also attacking cars and motorbikes.’

Thousands of Parisians had lined streets around the Arc de Triomphe as the PSG players took part in a victory parade towards the Trocadero monument, opposite the Eiffel Tower.

They were able to lift the trophy for a few minutes before the fighting broke out, and the entire event was cancelled, along with a planned cruise down the Seine. 

The famous Fouquet's restaurant on the Champs Elysee closed for the evening, along with designer shops like Louis Vuitton.

Security guards could be seen surrounding shop windows and fighting youths who were trying to break in.

‘We were overwhelmed,’ said a 
spokesman for the Alliance police union, saying that officers had been 
charged by hundreds of thugs.

PSG is now ultimately owned by the massively wealthy gulf state of Qatar and is now one of the richest clubs in the world.

Its
 riches helped it to secure its first Championship trophy in 19 years on
 Monday night, prompting celebrations by star players including Beckham,
 the former England captain who was signed in February.

But PSG has never been able to shake off its hooligan following. Many of them come from housing estates bordering Paris.

France's socialist government was today accused of allowing ‘scum and barbarians’ free rein to ‘ransack the heart of Paris’.

Opposition politicians said the 
trouble showed the ‘amateurism’ of Interior Minister Manuel Valls who 
had displayed ‘inertia’ in the face of hooligan gangs.

Geoffroy Didier, deputy  general secretary of the opposition UMP party attacked the ‘unacceptable confusion in the heart of the capital where the government is primarily responsible’ asking: ‘Where was the chief of police? What orders were given or not given to act? What did the Interior Minster do?’

Mr Didier said mass marches by families against gay marriage had been tightly policed by the Socialists in recent weeks, but the hooligans had initially been left alone.

‘Manuel Valls has gradually shown his true face: that of a partisan minister – severe with families when they have right on their side, inert with delinquents protected by the left wing culture of excuses,’ said Mr Didier.

Jeremy Redler , a UMP official in the upmarket 16th sixteenth arrondissement where the worst violence took place, also highlighted the ‘amateurism with which this large-scale event was organised by the Ministry of Interior and the Paris police’.

Mr Redler said the ‘safety of Parisians was undermined by thugs who were unable to be contained by the police.’

The most stinging criticism of Mr Valls came from National Front president Marine Le Pen who spoke of the ‘welter of scum’ and ‘barbarians who have nothing to do with the fans of the football club’ and who ‘ransacked the heart of Paris’.

Ms Le Pen said the government should show ‘zero tolerance’ against ‘these thugs who believe that everything is possible on our land’.

Mr Valls, meanwhile, today tried to shift blame for the trouble on to PSG, saying that ‘football is sick again’, and that ‘the club had been problems controlling its supporters’.

He said that the hooliganism projected ‘a terrible image of Paris, and of France’ and that his police force had done everything possible to stop the trouble.
