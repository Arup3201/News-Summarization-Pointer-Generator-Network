What a difference 90 minutes can make.

Watford headed in to Friday night's live TV game at Fulham looking to avoid a fifth straight defeat.

But they left Craven Cottage dreaming of automatic promotion having put in one of the finest team performances in the Championship so far this season.

Add to that some favourable results on Saturday and the Hornets find themselves occupying the final play-off position, just five points off Ipswich in second.

The contrast between the run leading up to Friday night and the thumping 5-0 win rather aptly sums up the rollercoaster ride at Vicarage Road since the Pozzo family took over.

After a slow start to the 2012-13 season, Gianfranco Zola's Hornets were the best team in the Championship in the second half of that campaign.

They really should have got promoted but froze on the big stage; first narrowly losing out to Hull for automatic promotion, then being beaten by Crystal Palace in the play-off final.

Early last season, Zola left the club having failed to recapture the form of his debut campaign and in came Beppe Sannino.

Sannino could only achieve a 13th-placed finish last season and he is one of three managers to have left the club already this campaign, with Oscar Garcia and Billy McKinlay also coming and going.

Before Friday night, Slavisa Jokanovic looked to be on the brink of becoming the fourth boss to go but the emphatic win has not only given him time, but should have raised confidence levels to the heights they were at in the spring of 2013.

Zola's stamp is still very much on this Watford side, who still use the fluid 3-5-2 system he brought in so effectively.

How much Watford's system is defined by the fact parent club Udinese have been 3-5-2 stalwarts for decades is another matter, but if it keeps working as it did on Friday night, no one at Vicarage Road will be complaining.

It was a performance of genuine Premier League quality. The midfield trio of Gianni Munari, Daniel Toszer and Almen Abdi - as excellent at Craven Cottage as he was as Watford's creator-in-chief under Zola - look like they would be at ease in the top flight.

Troy Deeney and Matej Vydra were the best strikeforce in the Championship two years ago and given their ages - 26 and 22 respectively - there is no reason they can't be again this season.

Scotland international Ikechi Anya offers blistering pace out wide and while the defence is still a concern, the experience of goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes and centre back Sebastien Bassong may prove invaluable - especially if the latter's loan deal from Norwich can be extended beyond January.

It has been a case of one step forward under Zola, then two steps back in the year since his departure as the club has become something of a laughing stock. But Friday night's performance was as good as, if not better, than Watford were playing in the winter and spring of 2012-13 when they were sweeping all before them.

It was this time two years ago that Watford began to set the Championship alight. 

If they can record consecutive wins by beating struggling Wigan at Vicarage Road on Saturday, they may just start to believe promotion is on the cards.

Good week for... BLACKPOOL

Finally. It's been a disastrous season for Blackpool, who already look all but relegated. Saturday's 1-0 win over Birmingham though, Lee Clark's first since taking over and the club's first in six, has given Blackpool a modicum of hope. It was made all the more sweeter for Clark against the club who sacked him earlier this season.

Bad week for... BRIGHTON

Having finished in the play-offs in consecutive seasons on their return to the second tier, the Seagulls' most likely route out of the Championship looks like relegation after Saturday's 3-0 defeat at league leaders Derby left them two points adrift of safety in 22nd place. How much time does Sami Hyypia have left?

Talent scout: Adam Reach (Middlesbrough)

What is it with Middlesbrough and producing talented left wingers? Premier League internationals Stewart Downing, Chris Brunt and Adam Johnson all came through Boro's academy, and 21-year-old Reach is looking increasingly like he can emulate them. Equally capable of playing left back, Reach set up two in Saturday's 5-1 demolition of Millwall at The Den.
