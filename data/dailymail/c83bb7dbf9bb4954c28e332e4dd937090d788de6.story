Wrapping up warm: Owen and Kiera Creswell from Berkshire make the most of their bank holiday weekend on Bournemouth beach, as cold air and clouds kept the sun away

Organising a bank holiday ramble or a relaxing trip to the beach?

Make sure you’ve got wellies, an umbrella, a warm coat – and perhaps a plan B.

Unlike the pleasant sunshine and gentle breezes of a year ago, heavy downpours are set to transform this May Day into a grey and instantly forgettable affair.

Today’s temperatures could drop as 
much as 11 degrees below the month’s average of 16c (61f) as forecasters
warn the country may be heading towards the coldest start to May in 70 
years.

And after the 
wettest April since records began in 1910, the gloom doesn’t stop there.

By Thursday, as much as 1.5in of rain is expected across parts of the 
country, causing localised flooding.

A
Met Office spokesman said: ‘A deepening depression to the south west of
the country will engage with warm, humid air over northern France to 
bring a spell of heavy and persistent rain from late on Wednesday night.

‘Due
to the saturated nature of the ground this may well lead to some 
disruption from localised surface water flooding during Thursday.

'As the
low deepens, strong winds may increase to gale force, especially near 
the south coast.’

In London yesterday the mercury hit 
just 9c (48f), while in Leeming, North Yorkshire, it plummeted as low as
-3C (27f). Temperatures are expected to remain below the 16c average 
until the end of the week – as the heaviest of the rain arrives.

The
flood warnings come days after Harry McCabe, 54, from Basingstoke, 
Hampshire, slipped and fell 160ft to his death during a cliff-top walk 
with his wife Samantha, their 12-year-old daughter Faye and her friend.

Investigations
will examine whether recent heavy rain may have played a part in the 
tragedy at Mullion Cove in Cornwall, where the family was on holiday.

Meanwhile, police searching for 
eight-year-old Ian Bell, who disappeared after falling into the swollen 
River Wear on April 27, have found the body of a young boy.

Durham Police said the discovery was made downstream from Page Bank Bridge near Willington, County Durham.

'It's been pretty cold,' said forecaster Nick Prebble of MeteoGroup yesterday.

'We've
seen flurries of snow over the Grampians and north-west Highlands, and 
there's been sleet there, too. There have also been a few light sleet 
showers in northern England.'

More snow flurries are forecast over high ground in Scotland.

Four
flood warnings remain in place and the Environment Agency said that 
while water levels were receding, officials were continuing to monitor the situation.
