A touching video has emerged of the moment a garbage man surprised a young truck fanatic who has autism with his very own garbage pick-up.

Daniel, who is aged five, can be seen running down the family's front path in excited anticipation of the weekly visit.

The young boy from California watches and points as the truck driver - known only as Manuel - steps down from the cab as his parents stand near him.

Manuel then comes through the family's front yard and hands Daniel a bright orange bag.

An intrigued Daniel walks up to Manuel and takes the bag from him before peeking inside to see the green truck - he puts the bag down on the path to momentarily consider the unexpected present inside.

Daniel's mother, who often videos trash days which are a big deal for her son, posted the video on Facebook with the message:  'One man, one moment, touching the life of an autistic child. Our hearts are overflowing. There are already many who have watched this video who don't know us.

'Our son, Daniel, is 5. He has autism. What started out as a fear has turned into a fascination.

'I showed him a YouTube video of a garbage truck a couple of years ago and he's been obsessed ever since. Like many children on the autism spectrum, this has become a ritual for him.

'He loves the predictable movement of the hoist and is excited by the entire spectacle. He waits all week for Monday morning pickup.

Daniel thanks Manuel in the video which has now gone viral after his mother posted it on Facebook

'He knows exactly which cans are being picked up each week, and Sundays are special for him when he takes the cans out with his dad.

'Our recycle man, known only to us as Manuel, is his favorite.

'He always has a big smile for Daniel, who is faithfully waiting for him every Monday. To him, trash pickup is like a symphony.

'He synchronizes his hand movements with the truck. We have so many "Trash Day" videos, but this one is like no other.'

It has been reported Manuel's good deed is going to be recognized by his employer, E.J. Harrison & Sons.
