Louis van Gaal was feeling festive at Old Trafford on Boxing Day as he decided to spread some Christmas cheer by giving out some presents to fans.

Manchester United's manager decided to play the role of Santa Clause as he gave out gifts to Red Devils supporters before their game against Newcastle.

And he was quickly rewarded for his generosity as Wayne Rooney scored twice in the first half to give his side a comfortable lead.

Robin van Persie then added a third soon after half time, before Papiss Cisse grabbed a late consolation penalty for Newcastle after Phil Jones had fouled Jack Colback.

Van Gaal wasn't the only gift giver of the afternoon at Old Trafford as earlier on in the afternoon Sir Alex Ferguson had been on the pitch giving out an award.

The former boss was on the pitch to present groundsman Tony Sinclair with an award for his fine work.

Sinclair won the best groundsman trophy and was presented the accolade by the club's legendary former manager.
