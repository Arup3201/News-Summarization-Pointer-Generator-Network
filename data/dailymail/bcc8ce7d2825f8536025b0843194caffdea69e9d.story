She weighs in at an impressive 100,000 tons and is longer than The Shard is tall.

And today the mammoth USS Theodore Roosevelt was anchored just off the coast of Hampshire because she was simply 'too big' to sail into the Royal Navy's historic Portsmouth dockyard.

Thousands of stunned spectators jammed roads and lined the banks of the River Solent to welcome the 1,092ft-long floating city as it arrived for a five-day visit to the UK on the first stop of a global deployment.

Thousands of spectators lined the banks of the River Solent in Hampshire today to welcome the 1,092ft-long USS Theodore Roosevelt as it arrived for a five-day visit to the UK. The U.S. aircraft carrier, which measures 1,092ft in length, docked off Stokes Bay in Gosport, Hampshire

The 100,000-tonne U.S. aircraft carrier was forced to anchor off Stokes Bay in Gosport because it was 'too big' to sail into the Royal Navy's historic Portsmouth dockyard. More than 5,000 sailors are set to swamp Portsmouth during the five-day visit, giving a boost to the economy

The carrier measures 1,092ft in length, which is the equivalent to 30 London buses, and displaces up to 100,000 tons of water at full load

The mighty ship, which is making its first port of call during a round-the-world deployment, is much larger than the Royal Navy's next generation of carriers, The Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth, which weigh in at 65,000 tonnes when they finally become operational

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'The USS Theodore Roosevelt's visit shows yet again that UK/U.S. relations are as close as ever'

The Royal Navy’s First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, said today: ‘It is excellent to see US Navy carrier steel in Portsmouth'

While a debate rages in the UK over the Government's failure to commit to the Nato target of spending two per cent of GPD on defence, the Roosevelt is a potent symbol of American military might.

With 90 aircraft on board, the ship can operate for up to 25 years at over unlimited distances, projecting US air power around the globe.

She can go three months without resupply and her two giant nuclear reactor generate enough power for a small city.

One social media user wrote: 'Most ships get measures in metres, this one comes in acres!'

Another joked in reference to recent increased tensions between the West and Russia: 'Wonder if any Russian bombers will fly up the Channel this week?'

Brian and Jacqui Rodgers, who travelled from Dorset to see the 30-year-old carrier arrive at Stokes Bay, said they were 'very impressed' by the ship.

Mr Rodgers told The News local paper: 'It's a slumbering giant. I guess it's one of the biggest carriers in the world.

'It's a bit like watching a floating town arrive off the coast.'

Mrs Rodgers added: 'It's massive. When you see a sailing boat by go by the side of it you realise how huge it is.'

American sailors have disembarked from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier for shore leave while it is moored in Stokes Bay, Gosport

The American crew of more than 5,600 includes 3,200 sailors and 2,480 airmen, a number which is expected to have a huge impact on the area

The city's bars, clubs, restaurants and visitor attractions are bracing themselves for a massive footfall when the sailors hit dry land

The arrival of the thousands of sailors is set to boost local economy by an estimated £1.5million during the ship's five-day visit

And with more than 5,000 American sailors due to disembark from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier for shore leave while it is moored in Stokes Bay, Gosport, the local economy is set for an estimated £1.5million boost.

The city's bars, clubs, restaurants and visitor attractions are bracing themselves for a massive footfall when the sailors hit dry land during their ship's five-day visit.

Nightclub Tiger Tiger located on the banks of Portsmouth Harbour is opening its doors at 9am during the week to put on English breakfasts.

The mighty ship, which is making its first port of call during a round-the-world deployment, is much larger than the Royal Navy's next generation of carriers, The Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth, which weigh in at 65,000 tonnes when they finally become operational.

Among Roosevelt's crew are six Royal Navy aircraft handlers who are honing their skills before serving aboard the new Royal Navy carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, which enters service in 2017.

The carrier's escort ship, the guided missile destroyer Winston S Churchill, was able to dock at Portsmouth.

She traditionally carries a UK navigator to honour the ship's British connection with the post currently held by 27-year-old Lieutenant Lynsey Sewell.

Welcoming the U.S. ship, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said last night: 'The USS Theodore Roosevelt's visit shows yet again that UK/US relations are as close as ever. Ten days ago, I was the first of his counterparts to meet incoming Defence Secretary Ash Carter.

'Having the Roosevelt in Portsmouth today is yet another example of the world's broadest, deepest and most enduring defence relationship at work. I'm thrilled to be going aboard today to welcome the crew personally.'

The giant aircraft carrier was named after Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, and is nicknamed the 'Big Stick'

Following its visit to the UK, USS Roosevelt will make its way to the Middle East where it is expected to take part in airstrikes against ISIS

More than 5,000 American sailors are due to disembark from the aircraft carrier while it is moored in  Gosport, over the next five days, giving local businesses an estimated £1.5million boost. Donna Jones, leader of Portsmouth council, said: 'This is great news for Portsmouth'

Spectators were keen to take photographs and 'selfies' of the ship as it made its way in to Hampshire today before docking in Gosport

The Royal Navy's First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, added: 'It is excellent to see US Navy carrier steel in Portsmouth. And in barely two years we will see UK carrier steel here too.

'We warmly welcome the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group - a reflection of the close partnership between our nations and navies, and the value of credible seapower in support of our shared national interests.'

Senior officers aboard the American ship will visit Royal Navy officials to discuss recent global operations and get an update on the UK's carrier programme.

Donna Jones, leader of Portsmouth council, said: 'This is great news for Portsmouth because it means money spent in local businesses, restaurants, cafes and shops, as well as strengthening the ties between the British and American Navy.'
