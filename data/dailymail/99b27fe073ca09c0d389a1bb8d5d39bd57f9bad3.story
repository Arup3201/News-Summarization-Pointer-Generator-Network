Mourn: Argentina's squad observed a minute's silence and cancelled their press conference in her honour

The death of Fernandez, daughter of famous journalist Miguel 'Titi' Fernandez, forced the Argentina squad to cancel their pre-match press conference on Wednesday.

They held a minute's silence in her honour.

Police say that the car spun out of control after colliding with another vehicle and plummeted from a cliff on the BR-391 road near Oliviera.

Fernandez was thrown from the vehicle upon collision and and police have arrested two people from the other car.

Argentina Football Association general Secretary Juan Carlos Crespi said: 'She was much loved.

'I would like to apologise to the media but we will not hold a press conference.

'Old people like me are also affected because children normally bury their parents, not the other way around.'

Argentina face Belgium in their World Cup quarter-final on Saturday having overcome Switzerland 1-0 after extra-time in the last 16.
