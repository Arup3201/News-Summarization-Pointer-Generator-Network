A dental assistant fired because her boss thought she was too attractive wants the Iowa Supreme Court to reconsider its decision rejecting her discrimination lawsuit.

Melissa Nelson's attorney asked the all-male court Friday to withdraw its Dec. 21 ruling, which she called a 'significant blow to gender equality.'

The court ruled that Nelson's firing by Fort Dodge dentist James Knight might've been unfair but wasn't illegal.

Fired: Melissa Nelson was so attractive, Iowa dentist James Knight fired her out of fear she'd make him want to stray from his marriage

Hello ladies: Despite Nelson being 21 years younger than him, married, and 'not interested in a relationship,' Knight believed it would be too hard not to start an affair with her

The court - and specifically Justice 
Edward Mansfield, who penned the decision - ruled firings of 
employees who are an 'irresistible attraction' to bosses do not violate 
the Iowa Civil Rights Act because they're motivated by feelings and emotion, not 
gender.

Nelson's filing says the court erred because her gender played a role in her termination.

Knight said he fired Nelson because he'd grown too close to her and worried he'd try to start an affair.

The court ruled 7-0 bosses can sack 
employees they see as an 'irresistible attraction,' even if they have 
not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong.

Talking with CNN recently, Nelson said of the decision, 'I don't think this is fair. I don't think this is right.'

An attorney for Knight said the decision, the first of its kind in Iowa, is a victory for family values because Knight fired Nelson in the interest of saving his marriage, not because she was a woman.

But Nelson's attorney said Iowa's all-male high court, one of only a handful in the nation, failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace.

Nelson insisted she was never interested in Knight romantically, regardless of his own feelings.

'Absolutely not,' she said. 'I'm happily married.'

Since Knight fired her she has worked as a waitress six nights a week.

While her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he couldn't look at her without being aroused, Nelson said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices.

Asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive, Nelson laughed at the question.

'I'm just an ordinary girl,' she said. 'Just an ordinary mom.'

Her attorney, Paige Fiedler, said, 'These judges sent a message to Iowa women that they don't think men can be held responsible for their sexual desires and that Iowa women are the ones who have to monitor and control their bosses' sexual desires. If they get out of hand, then the women can be legally fired for it.'

Nelson, 32, worked for Knight for 10 years, and he considered her a stellar worker. But in the final months of her employment, he complained that her tight clothing was distracting, once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing, according to the opinion.

He also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying, 'that's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.'

Knight and Nelson — both married with children — started exchanging text messages, mostly about personal matters, such as their families.

Knight's wife, who also worked in the dental office, discovered the messages and demanded Nelson be fired. The Knights consulted their pastor, who agreed that terminating Nelson was appropriate.

Knight fired Nelson and gave her one month's severance. He later told Nelson's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her.

Nelson was stunned because she viewed 
the 53-year-old Knight as a father figure and had never been interested 
in starting a relationship, Fiedler said.

Nelson filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination, arguing Knight wouldn't have terminated her if she was male. She did not allege sexual harassment because Knight's conduct may not have risen to that level and didn't particularly offend her, Fiedler said.

However, it has been revealed Knight sent Nelson raunchy text messages about six months before her dismissal asking how often she 'experiences orgasms.'

 'The motives
behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so 
to preserve his marriage.

Knight argued Nelson was fired not because of her gender, but because her continued employment threatened his marriage. A district judge agreed, dismissing the case before trial, and the high court upheld that ruling.

Mansfield noted that Knight had an all-female workforce and Nelson was replaced by a woman.

He said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner's family. One such case from the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a business owner's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage. In that case, the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct.

Mansfield said allowing Nelson's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender.

Knight's attorney, Stuart Cochrane, said the court got it right. The decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination; in this case, by allowing Knight to honor his wife's wishes to fire Nelson, he said.

Knight is a very religious and moral individual, and he sincerely believed that firing Nelson would be best for all parties, he said.

'While there was really no fault on the part of Mrs. Nelson, it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman,' he said. 'The motives behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so to preserve his marriage.

'I don't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all. In my view, this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law.'
