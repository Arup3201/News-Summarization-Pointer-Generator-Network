A mother hippo appears to show off her new hairstyle after emerging from a swim wearing a glamorous wig made out of weeds.

The female, accompanied by her calf, went for a dip in one of the pools at the Kruger National Park in South Africa, which is covered in green vegetation.

However, moments later she surfaced from her cooling dip in a pose appearing to show a whole new hairstyle.

The hippo was given her new hairstyle after jumping into one of the pools to cool off at the Kruger National Park in South Africa 

The hilarious moment was captured on camera by photographer Michael Heramb, who spent two weeks taking pictures of the animals around the national park with his wife.

The 58-year-old said: 'This was a hippo cow who brought her calf into a pool with a pod of hippos in it already.

'She was challenged when she arrived by the bull, but she was not going to stand back for him.

Mr Heramb said the hippo didn't seem to notice or care that she had weeds all over the top of her head 

'So a bit of posturing took place between the two and eventually they settled down and chilled under all the weeds.

'But when she rose to the surface with her calf this was the hair style.'

According to Mr Heramb, who know works as a farmer in Wellington in the Western Cape, South Africa, she didn't notice the weeds on her head.

He spent several hours watching them from a river bank as the pod, consisting of several cows and calves, chilled out.

He added: 'She didn't react to the new hair - to be quite honest with you I don't think they notice.

I love the weeds on her head - she seems very content with the look.

'I like the photo's because they show three sides of the hippo.

'In some she is the gentle, caring mother, in others she's aggressive but she also plays the part of a chilled and laid back mother too.'
