Chelsea have called for an end to sexism in football after footage emerged of fans directing abuse at their club doctor Eva Carneiro.

Recordings of fans at Manchester United and Manchester City chanting and shouting obscenities at Carneiro were broadcast by the BBC on Thursday night, leading to an unequivocal statement from the Blues.

A spokesman for the club told the Guardian: 'The issue of equality is one we take extremely seriously and we abhor discrimination in all its forms, including sexism. Such behaviour is unacceptable and we want it eradicated from the game.'

Chelsea have called for an end to sexism in football after fans directed abuse at their club doctor

Campaign group Women in Football is launching an anti-sexism social media drive on Friday and has also contacted all 92 Premier League and Football League clubs asking them to champion female members of staff in their matchday programmes ahead of International Women's Day on March 8.

Minister for Sport Helen Grant is supporting the initiative.

She said: 'It is absolutely right that we champion and celebrate women who work in the football industry and play vital roles in making the game the success that it is.

Carneiro joined Chelsea in 2009 but was promoted to the first team by Andre Villas-Boas in 2011

'I want more women to get involved in football across the board and to see it as a great industry to work in. Sexism, in any shape or form, should not be tolerated so I applaud this push to encourage people to report any incidents of sexist abuse and for the promotion of inclusivity across football.'

Carolyn Radford, chief executive at Mansfield Town, told the BBC: ‘You are almost made to feel if you should be made to tolerate such abuse. If it was racist language being chanted at me then perhaps people would say something about it, but because it is just banter, so to speak, I’ve got to flick my hair and just accept it.’
