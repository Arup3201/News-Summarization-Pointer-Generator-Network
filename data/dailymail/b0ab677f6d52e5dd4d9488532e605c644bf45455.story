Jose Mourinho will wait until after the final game of the
season to hand his report to Chelsea on the futures of club legends Frank
Lampard, John Terry and Ashley Cole.

The whereabouts of the long-serving trio next season
remains in doubt with all three out of contract in the summer.

'I don't know but I don't
think so,' said Mourinho when asked if Terry, Lampard and Cole would play their final game for the club at Cardiff City on Sunday.  'The club knows my opinion. The players

Uncertain future: Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and John Terry are all out of contract this summer

Terry is in negotiations with the club and it is likely that after a formidable season he will be retained.

But Cole's future, after limited action this term, is looking more likely to be away from Stamford Bridge.

It is possible Lampard, who is 36 in June, may have played his final match for Chelsea already.

'Frank
 Lampard is ill, he is in bed,' Mourinho said. Asked to reflect on 
Lampard's distinguished career at Stamford Bridge, he added: 'Maybe in a
 few years he will have a statue where Peter Osgood is. He's one of the 
biggest players (in the history) of this club.'

Mourinho
 strangely described the defeat to Sunderland as the 'highlight' of his 
first season back at Chelsea as he again hinted at where he felt his 
team's Barclays Premier League title chances had been extinguished.

Mourinho
 was fined £10,000 on Thursday for his sarcastic appraisal of officials 
following the loss to the Black Cats, and also failed in an appeal 
against an £8,000 penalty imposed after the defeat at Aston Villa.

Asked
 his standout moment of the campaign, he chose the penalty awarded by 
Mike Dean and converted by Fabio Borini which earned Sunderland a 2-1 
win on April 19 and ended Mourinho's 77-match unbeaten home league run.

'This
 season I lost a match at Stamford Bridge for the first time,' Mourinho 
said. 'I lost with the second goal (against Sunderland) and for me 
that's the highlight.'

Mourinho
 declined to comment fully on Football Association matters - his 
disciplinary sanctions or the findings of Greg Dyke's commission - but 
insisted he was happy to be back after a near six-year absence, despite 
his disciplinary troubles.

'I
 like to be back,' Mourinho added. 'I don't enjoy defeats, but I have to
 say that to lose at Crystal Palace is English football.

'To
 lose like we did against Sunderland or Aston Villa is not English 
football and I like English football, I don't like what isn't English 
football.'
