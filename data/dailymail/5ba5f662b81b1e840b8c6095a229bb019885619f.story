RUDE, vulgar, gross and hilarious...it’s no surprise South Park has legions of fans.

But even the cartoon's most devoted followers would run for the hills at the thought of a video game based on the 2D series.

Thankfully, though, all fears are allayed when you see South Park: The Stick Of Truth in action.

Just like the cartoon: It looks so good, you'll often forget you're playing a game

You begin as the new kid in town facing a harrowing challenge: making friends. As you start your quest, the children of South Park are embroiled in a city-wide, live-action-role-playing game, casting imaginary spells and swinging fake swords.

Over time, the simple children’s game escalates into a battle of good and evil that threatens to consume the world. 

And from the perilous battlefields of the fourth-grade playground, a young hero will rise, destined to be South Park’s saviour.

Developers Obsidian Entertainment, best known for their work on Knights Of The Old Republic: The Sith Lords, have gone to town in making this as authentic a South Park experience as possible.

Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have penned the story and there’s a real intent to break the poor cartoon-to-game curse.

You’ll be able to customise your character with an arsenal of magical weapons and armour.

Take that, sucker: You'll have to use spells and weapons to battle some vampires

Plus, with nearly a billion character and clothing combinations, you’ll actually be able to insert yourself into the cartoon.

Graphics are brilliant. Everything from the little 'bobs' the characters do when they move to their quirky facial expressions has been captured. Indeed, it almost looks like you’re watching an episode.

In a nod to Skyrim and Fallout, The Stick of Truth is an open-world game. Characters can level up certain skills, such as magic or weapons, and can choose different classes (Mage, Cleric, Fighter and Thief) in their quest to become...cool.

Each time you level up, you’re treated to Cartman dishing out your (often rude) new title. Combat is turn-based, which will appeal to hardcore RPG fans fed of clunky real-time combat often associated with modern games in the genre.

It’s refreshing to see a cartoon-to-video-game offering be on course to do a series justice – something movie-game tie-ins just can’t seem to do these days.

You shall not pass! Cartman stands firm as archers charge towards him

All apart from the recent Battleship, that is, which sunk in both cinemas and on consoles - the game, in particular, being one of the worst I’ve played in years. 

Can South Park do the near impossible and pave the way for quality cartoon and movie video game transitions?

We'll have to wait until March next year to find out.
