A Chinese actor who apologised to his pregnant wife online for cheating on her has set a new record on the communist superpower's version of Twitter.

Wen Zhang - a popular Chinese film and television star - was recently snapped canoodling with Yao Di, his co-star on the appropriately named TV series Naked Marriage.

The images shocked millions due to Zhang's public image as 'a sensitive and happily married family man,' the Associated Press reports.

Damning photos: The snaps that forced Zhang to apologise

Zhang, 29, has been married to fellow actress Ma Yili for six years and took to Weibo - a Chinese social media platform - in an attempt to patch things up.

'I have brought this upon myself. A mistake is a mistake. This has nothing to do with anyone else,' The Hollywood Reporter translates Wen's message as reading.

'Today, I am willing to accept all the consequences. I've let down Ma Yili and our children. My mistake does not deserve to be forgiven, and it will be difficult for me to make amends for all the harm I've caused. But I want to do it. I have to do it. This is what I'll do for the rest of my life.'

Zhang's wife is currently pregnant with the couple's second child.

His heartfelt confession was posted on Monday to his more than 52 million followers along with the admission: 'the children could have had a warm and nice life, but everything was destroyed by me.'

By Wednesday, his post had been forwarded more than 1.2 million times and received nearly 1.9 million comments. Many followers expressed anger towards the rising Asian star.

His wife later responded, somewhat philosophically, 'Cherish what you have at the moment. Being in love is easy, being married is not.'

At one point the topic was trending above the mystery of missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which has gripped the region and the world.

Government censorship restricts what can be said on social media in China but Zhan Jiang, a journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University told Associated Press that unlike political news, 'entertainment news isn't restricted or censored by the authorities.

'From the authorities' point of view it isn't good if the public cares too much about politics, but entertainment is safe.'

Sina Weibo (the official name of the micro-blogging service) said on its site Monday evening that the vast majority of people discussing Zhang's post were educated women and girls aged 24 and under.

Wen's 'tweet' broke a record set by pop singer Faye Wong in September when she announced via Sina Weibo that she was getting a divorce.

But it is yet to catch up to the now legendary 3.4 million retweets garnered on Twitter after American chat show and Oscars host Ellen DeGeneres posted a 'selfie' of her alongside a bevy of A-list Hollywood stars at this year's Academy Awards ceremony.

The photo - which includes Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep and Kevin Spacey - was such a hit it caused Twitter's servers to crash for minutes.

It has since inspired myriad parodies across the world.
