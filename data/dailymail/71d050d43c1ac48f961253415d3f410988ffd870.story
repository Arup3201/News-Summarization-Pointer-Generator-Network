The only way is up: David Miliband's new job as head of a charity in the U.S. is likely to likely to be five times higher than his salary as a Labour MP

When he swaps South Shields for Manhattan, David Miliband will be earning more than President Obama.

As head of the International Rescue Committee, his pay package is likely to be about £300,000 – nearly five times higher than his wage as a Labour MP.

On top of his salary comes complimentary private health care, a gold-plated, tax-free pension and a host of other perks.

The IRC said Mr Miliband’s pay was ‘private’ yesterday, but the organisation’s outgoing president got £295,000 a year for a 37-and-a-half hour week.

And, as a former Foreign Secretary who counts the Clintons and Blairs as close friends, Mr Miliband was in a position to command an even more generous deal.

The IRC’s money comes mainly from grants from taxpayers – including £110million of British aid over the last ten years. 

But from the moment he steps into his well-appointed office, near New York’s Grand Central Station, Mr Miliband will be in charge of a vast humanitarian organisation. It has 12,000 staff, and spent £240million on its programmes last year.

Yet despite the scale of his new job, Mr Miliband is understood to be keeping his lucrative sideline as a director of Sunderland FC – for which he is paid £125,000 for 15 days work.

The IRC, founded at the request of Albert Einstein in 1933, helps refugees from 40 countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti. It is a highly-regarded charity and its directors and ‘overseers’ include Henry Kissinger and former UN chief Kofi Annan.

Mr Miliband is likely to have been offered a number of perks to take up the role. These could include a housing allowance, limo allowance and health club membership.

‘It is not unusual for the charities to offer help with housing for someone who is moving to New York for the first time,’ said Pete Smith, who has studied the pay of charity leaders for US watchdog Charity Navigator.

Mr Miliband’s salary will be complemented by an estimated £8,000 towards private health insurance and a further £22,000 a year payment towards his pension.

A former IRC insider said: ‘He will have a big office in a nice part of New York.

‘It has a desk with big windows looking out over the city, and a large settee with space for several people to have informal meetings.

Connections: As a former foreign secretary who counts the Clintons as friends, Miliband was likely to have commanded an even higher salary than his predecessor

‘Miliband will be treated as a senior global executive, and in America such people are revered. They have big responsibilities and although they need to have that self-belief they are here to help people, basically they are not doing it “for charity”.

‘It’s a big operation and you have got to be on the ball.

‘There is a huge competition for funding among aid agencies whenever there is an emergency, and this is where somebody of David’s calibre will have the confidence to go into meetings with top people and make them get their chequebooks out.’

About two-thirds of the IRC’s £260million annual funding comes from US taxpayers, but over the past ten years Britain has donated £110million.

Since leaving government, Mr Miliband has earned nearly £1million on top of his £65,000 MP’s salary.

Commanding up to £20,000 as a speaker, his earnings total £985,315 including travel and accommodation for himself and his staff, according to the most recently published Commons register.

Flying around the globe, from the US to the Middle East, he took more than £64,400 from the advisory board of the United Arab Emirates ministry of foreign affairs, and £90,000 from the California-based Vantage-Point investment firm advising on international energy opportunities.

He even charged £7,650 for a cancelled speech to the Malaysian Investment Development Authority.

But now Mr Miliband is joining a charity,  he could feel under pressure to lead by example – and may be interested to know that in 2007 his predecessor at the IRC, George Rupp, and his wife, Nancy, personally donated $1million – worth three years’ wages.
