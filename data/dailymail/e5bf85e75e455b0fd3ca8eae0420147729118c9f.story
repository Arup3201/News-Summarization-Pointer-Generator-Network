McDonald's has been blasted for telling staff to return gifts and eat stale bread if they are struggling to get by on their wage.

The employee budget guide published online by the 'McResource' team also advised breaking food into smaller pieces to feel fuller on less, and 'quit complaining' to reduce stress levels.

It comes a month after the company came under fire for telling a Chicago employee to apply for government food stamps in response to claims she is struggling to feed her children.

'Quit complaining': The fast food chain has been blasted for advising staff to combat money worries with positivity

Pressure group Low Pay Is Not OK has 
attacked the global fast food company for the articles, which have since
been removed from the site, and published a video using screen grabs of the original site NBC reported.

The video reveals bosses advised: 'On a short term basis, do whatever it takes to dig out from your holiday debt.

'You may want to consider returning some 
of your unopened purchases that may not seem as appealing as they did. 
Selling some of your unwanted possessions on eBay or Craigslist could 
bring in some quick cash.

SING AWAY STRESS: Singing along to your favourite songs can lower your blood pressure

BREAK IT UP: Breaking food into pieces often results in eating less and still feeling full

CUT OUT DEBT: You may also want to consider returning some of your unopened purchases that may not seem appealing as they did.

QUIT COMPLAINING: Stress hormone levels rise by 15 per cent after ten minutes of complaining

PACK YOUR BAGS: At least two vacations a year can cut heart attack risk by 50 per cent

'Consider bringing a brown bag lunch and skipping the takeout... You might also consider a temporary part time job to dig out of debt quickly.'

Other advice included eating bruised apples instead of throwing them out, and 'sing away stress'.

Paradoxically, they also suggested 'two vacations a year can cut heart attack risk by 50 per cent'.

Critics lambasted the advice on social media.

One man tweeted: 'Ho Ho Ho! @McDonalds offers scrooge-worthy holiday budget and health tips to it's chronically exploited workers.'

Many have taken to publishing spoof advice using the hastag #OtherMcDonaldsAdvice.

One said: 'If you shave your head, you won't need shampoo. #OtherMcDonaldsAdvice'

Another said: '#OtherMcDonaldsAdvice if you give your kids empty boxes for Christmas they can also double as a bedroom!'

And one person tweeted: 'A good pair of pliers makes most dentist visits unnecessary. #OtherMcDonaldsAdvice'.

But despite a wave of criticism, McDonald’s has defended the site.

A spokesman said: 'The vast majority of the resources and information on the site are based on credible outside experts and well-published advice.'

She rejected backlash from Low Pay Is Not OK as 'an attempt by an outside organization to undermine a well-intended employee assistance resource website'.

However, she revealed McDonald's and Nurtur Health, which created the site, would 'review the content and make any necessary adjustments'.

Ruth Milkman, a professor of sociology at the City University of New York, told NBC the advice is 'probably well-intentioned but shows deep ignorance of what it means to survive on a low wage job.

'Between the low wages and the short hours, it’s tough out there.'

Last month, it emerged that more than half of America's fast food workers rely on benefits to support themselves.

And days later, news broke that the McDonald's helpline told an employee of 10 years to apply for government-provided food stamps to get by.

Mother-of-two Nancy Salgado called 'McResource' in October asking for help paying her heating bill, feeding her children and getting her sister medical care.

Instead of discussing a raise - Salgado has been on $8.25 an hour for a decade - or offering health cover, the representative said Salgado, a full-time employee, 'definitely should be able to qualify for both food stamps and heating assistance.'

New venture: The McHome service, trialled in a city near Dortmund, may be rolled out across Germany

McDonald's fans rejoiced as a German firm launched the nation's first McDonald's delivery service.

With a team of 20 drivers, catering firm Systengastronomie trialled the 'McHome' service on Saturday across Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, north east of Dortmund.

They delivered Big Macs and Happy Meals for the same price as restaurants with no delivery charge as part of what they branded 'Crazy Saturday'.

Christian Eckstein, the company's director, said: 'Since we often got asked about the non-existent delivery service, we dealt with the issue and decided to test this scenario for and with our customers on Crazy Saturday.'

But despite claims that other German cities are looking to follow suit, McDonald's is not on board with the project.

In a statement, a spokesman said: 'At the moment we are not planning a nationwide delivery service. But that does not exclude any local offers.

'A nationwide delivery service would be a big challenge, especially in sparsely populated areas with long distances.

'Unfortunately we can’t guarantee that our customers will receive the product just as fresh and delicious as they are in the restaurant.'

The Osnabrück McDonald’s is not the first to come up with the idea. The fast food giant has offered delivery in parts of Asia and Egypt before.
