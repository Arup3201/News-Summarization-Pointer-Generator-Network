After spending her life at the bottom of the heap, Malavath Poorna has finally come out on top.

The 13-year-old girl from India's lowest caste has become the youngest female to conquer Mount Everest, the world's highest peak.

The 'untouchable', whose laborer parents earn less than $600 a year, reached the summit on May 25. Now the Dalit wants to be a role model for other poor children.

'The aim of my expedition was to inspire 
young people and students from my kind of background,' she told BBC on a satellite phone from Base Camp, following her treacherous 52-day climb.

'For a tribal girl like 
me, opportunities are very rare and I was looking for one opportunity 
where I could prove my caliber.'

Her overjoyed parents couldn't contain their pride during a special ceremony to mark Malavath's achievement.

'We are 
happy that our girl has set the world record. We know she will go 
places. She is not only bright in academics, but also in adventure,' 
Malavath's parents told Times of India.

They said they hoped their son Naresh would also conquer Everest one day.

The
 determined teen was among a group of 20 disadvantaged Indian students 
handpicked by a government social welfare organization to join the 
expedition.

Times of India reported Andhra Pradesh Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society picked more than 500 students from 299 schools, before shortlisting 20.

The successful candidates trained at Darjeeling Himalayan Mountaineering 
Institute between October 26 and November 16.

In preparation for her 
Everest climb, Malavath trekked through the mountains of Darjeeling and Ladakh.

'I
 was initially afraid, but the training I received helped me overcome my
 fear. I never thought of giving up,' Malavath told the BBC, following the 
hazardous 29,000-foot hike.

'All around me were mountains. It was very beautiful.'

She said the thing she missed most while climbing was her mother's fried chicken.

Incredible: Malavath Poorna, 13, climbed the 29,029-foot-high mountain in 52 days

Brave: Just three days after Malavath Poorna's arrival at Everest Base Camp on 15 April, a deadly avalanche on the Nepalese side of the mountain killed 16 sherpas

Just three days after her arrival at Base Camp on April 15, a deadly avalanche on the Nepalese side of the mountain killed 16 sherpas.

Undeterred by the tragedy, Poorna along with Shekhar Babu, an experienced mountaineer, her friend S. Anand Kumar, a 16 year-old-boy from a poor family like hers, and a group of sherpas, continued the trek.

Kumar reached the top of Everest moments after Poorna did.

Difficult: The group trekked up the Tibetan side of the mountain, considered the more dangerous side

Officials said the duo's achievement is even more impressive as they climbed the peak from the more difficult Tibetan side.

Most climbers scale the world's tallest mountain from the easier Nepalese side, but Nepal forbids climbers younger than 16.

Poorna, meanwhile, is just a month older than the world's youngest Everest climber.

American Jordan Romero ascended the peak in 2010 when he was 13 years and 10 months.
