A British Marine has been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias in Syria and Iraq during time off work.

The 22-year-old is in the Royal Marine Commandos and was quizzed as he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey.

He is suspected of planning to join Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants.

The Marine is understood to have been due to go on leave, but it is unclear whether he was planning to return to his regiment after fighting for the Kurds.

US officials said he was believed to have been in online contact with a Kurdish group that has links in Turkey and the Kurdish frontline city of Irbil – the headquarters of Peshmerga units leading the fight against IS.

The Marine, who is understood not to be a Muslim, is serving with 45 Commando.

The unit is based at Condor barracks in Arbroath, Scotland, but has recently been training with US marines in the Californian desert.

He was stopped two weeks ago while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul.

His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said. His luggage, phone and laptop are all said to have been examined. He was returned to 45 Commando before being questioned by Scottish police on arrival in the UK.

Both Britain and the US have security operations to track down those contacting jihadi and Kurdish groups online.

But the suggestion a serving British soldier was considering joining the fight against IS will be a cause of grave concern for military chiefs. Sources last night confirmed that a Marine had been questioned and released without charge by civilian police in Scotland.

A Navy spokesman said: ‘We are aware of an incident involving a Royal Marine who has recently been interviewed by Police Scotland.’

He did not comment on the suggestion that the man was going to fight for Kurdish forces against IS, adding: ‘The matter is being investigated by the Royal Marines. It would be inappropriate to comment further.’

Sources stressed that ‘no criminal offence’ had been committed.

But security officials pointed out the propaganda value to IS of a serving UK serviceman being captured then paraded – prior to what they believe would be ‘certain beheading’.

They highlighted how IS used the fact that aid worker David Haines had served in the RAF for propaganda before he was murdered on video by the Briton known as Jihadi John.

More than 500 Britons are fighting for jihadists in Syria and Iraq – many of them for IS – with five or six recruits travelling from the UK to join up each week.

A small number of British passport holders are known to be fighting for Kurdish Peshmerga forces in Iraq, but it is unclear how many are in Syria.

While those fighting for jihadi groups have been the focus of a security and intelligence operation to identify and stop them on return, it is not known what will happen to those fighting for Kurdish groups.

Britain is training and supplying arms to Kurdish fighters battling IS. With all UK flights to Turkey being monitored, many of those planning to join fighters are known to be using different modes of transport to other European countries before continuing to the Syrian border.
