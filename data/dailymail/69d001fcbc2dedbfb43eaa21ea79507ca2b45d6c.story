Southampton have agreed an £8.7million fee with FC Twente for Dusan Tadic.

Sportsmail revealed Southampton's interest last week and the 25-year-old attacking midfielder, who has attracted attention from Liverpool and Everton in recent months, is earmarked to replace Adam Lallana.

First man: Tadic could be Koeman's first signing after Southampton agreed a fee for the attacking midfielder

Star signing: Tadic has been impressive during his time with Twente scoring and creating goals

Tadic scored 16 times in 33 league games last season for Twente, as they finished third behind Ajax and Feyenoord.

Ronald Koeman is hoping to make the Serbian his first signing after taking over at the Saints last month. 

Replacement: Tadic would fill the hole left by Adam Lallana who has joined Liverpool for £23million

Southampton, however, have been rebuffed in a £5million bid for Graziano Pelle at Feyenoord with the Italian striker valued at £9million.
