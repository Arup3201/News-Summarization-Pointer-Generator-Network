Without a care in the world and once again flaunting her surgically-enhanced body, Anthony Weiner's sexting partner Sydney Leathers was spotted relaxing by a pool in Los Angeles doing the very thing that made her famous - texting.

Ms Leathers sported a bright green bikini which barely held her double D breasts as she concentrated on typing messages in her phone.

A short time later, she decides to cool off by taking a dip in the pool, clearly enjoying her time as a lady of leisure.

Downtime: Anthony Weiner's sexting partner looks at her cellphone as she relaxes poolside - could she be sexting?

Tentative: Sydney cools down after spending time texting on her sun lounger

Having fun: With her green bikini barely containing her double D breasts, Leathers makes sure her hair doesn't get wet as she enjoys a dip in the pool

The 23-year-old is clearly enjoying the fame she has been afforded since she revealed Weiner
had continued exchanging X-rated messages with her, long after his 
resignation from the U.S. Congress.

Since then, she has tried her hand at
everything from porn movies to surgery to recording a single, cleverly titled 
Weinerizer, which she has desperately been trying to promote in recent 
weeks.

The busty 
brunette crashed the disgraced politician's concession party earlier 
this month, marking a disastrous conclusion in his mayoral campaign, 
telling reporters: 'I'm kind of the reason he's losing so might as well 
show up.'

And today, in his
first national media interview since suffering the devastating defeat, 
Weiner made light of the topic and blamed part of it on his name.

She rises: Leathers carefully climbs out of the pool, deciding she has had enough for the day

Shows off her derriere: Sydney was a little-known political blogger before the Weiner sexting scandal catapulted her to fame - but how long will it last?

Nonchalant: Sydney had a number of plastic surgery procedures performed before the mayoral primaries, including a breast enlargement, liposuction on her stomach and a nose job. She also had her teeth done

Dry time: Leathers, sporting heavy eyeliner, towels off after her quick dip in the pool

Happy: Sydney manages a huge smile for the cameras, showing off her newly-whitened teeth

Spotlight: She spoke at length about her months-long affair with Anthony Weiner, pictured here pre-surgery

'I'm not an idiot, I know it derailed my campaign. If my last name was Rivera and not Weiner, I mean that’s two-thirds of the crap I took,' he told Geraldo Rivero on his radio show.

'There’s
no mistaking the New York media world had a field day with my name and 
that’s part of the game. I had every tabloid in New York going bananas 
trying every day to derail me.'

But when Rivera suggested he take his wife Huma Abedin’s name, he resolutely said: 'I love my name.'

Weiner,
once the front runner for the mayoral race before the campaign imploded
when his continued sexting habit emerged, insisted his marriage is fine
despite recent events.

'My
wife’s good. My marriage’s good. Look, I won’t lie to you, a lot of 
people took runs at my wife that I think are entirely unfair,' he said. 
'God willing, my marriage survives everything, but I don’t take anything
for granted.'

Love the camera: Geraldo Rivera joked with Anthony Weiner on his radio show today that his sexting scandal took the heat off his half-naked selfie

Different kind of support: Sydney Leathers was using the primary attention to promote her new song

Fatherly love: Weiner says now that he is out of the mayoral race he has more time to spend with his son, who he was pictured with in New York today

Miss Abedin largely disappeared from the public eye following revelations that her husband had continue exchanging X-rated messages with Sydney Leathers long after his resignation from the U.S. Congress.

After stepping down from Congress in 2011 following his first sexting scandal, Weiner was 
hoping that his campaign for mayor would be his chance to reenter public
office and clear his name.

The July revelations that he continued having inappropriate online relationships with women, including Leathers.
