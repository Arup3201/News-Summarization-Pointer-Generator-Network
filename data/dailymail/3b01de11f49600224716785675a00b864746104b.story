A daughter has today spoken of her anger after a two-week stay in a private care home left her mother looking like a 'living skeleton' and fighting for life.

Karen Perrement, 52, said her mother, Nell Perrement, 75, spent three months in hospital with severe dehydration and acute renal failure after the nightmare fortnight stay which cost £1,500.

The mother-of-three has hit out at County Care Homes, which runs St Peter’s Residential Home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, after they awarded her a settlement of £25,000 but did not admit liability.

Nell Perrement was diagnosed with dementia aged 65. Her daughter said she looked like a 'living skeleton' after a fortnight stay at St Peter's Residential Home which she claims left her mother severely dehydrated

Nell Perrement was diagnosed with dementia aged 65. Her daughter said she looked like a ‘living skeleton’ after a fortnight stay at St Peter’s Residential Home which she claims left her severely dehydrated.

Ms Perrement, of Claydon, near 
Ipswich, said last night: ‘It was a very traumatic experience for her 
and she has never really fully recovered.

‘She looked like a living skeleton. I will never get the answers I truly want from the care home.’

Mrs
Perrement went into respite care at privately-owned St Peter’s just 
after Christmas 2009 to allow Karen and her three children to go away 
for a few days.

The grandmother was diagnosed with vascular dementia 10 years ago when she was just 65.

But
Ms Perrement and her daughter Samantha, 23, were distressed
when they went to get widow Mrs Perrement to take her home 
with them.

Karen, a
charity worker, said: ‘She was no longer the mum I knew. She had lost a
lot of weight, she had black finger nails, her breathing was shallow 
and she was very cold.’

They took Mrs Perrement, a mother-of-two, back home on January 13, 2010.

Karen immediately called 999 because she feared for her mother’s life. After
being rushed to Ipswich Hospital, Mrs Perrement was diagnosed with 
severe dehydration and acute renal failure. Karen was told to expect the
worst.

‘I was just in complete and utter shock and could not understand what had happened and gone so wrong,’ she said.

Medical
reports show that Mrs Perrement received a staggering 20 litres of 
rehydrating fluids during her first five days in hospital.

Karen Perrement and her mother Nell were awarded £25,000 by County Care Homes, who did not accept liability

The weak pensioner was forced to stay in hospital for three months until she improved enough to go home.

Ms Perrement, who as well as daughter 
Samantha has two sons, Robert, 15, and Kered, 14, said: ‘This time when 
mum came home it was as a completely different person.

Vascular dementia is the second most common kind of dementia after Alzheimer's.

The condition is caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain.

Typical symptoms of dementia include memory loss, physical weakness, 
mood changes and problems with language, reasoning and decision making.

Vascular dementia follows a stepped progression, with symptoms remaining
at a constant level for a time before suddenly deteriorating.

‘She
just isn’t there any more. Her eyes are dead, her hands are clenched, 
she dribbles and she doesn’t laugh or respond to the TV or music.

‘Her happy dementia life has gone and she now looks frightened and traumatised. The stress and strain on us all is unbearable and we’re physically and emotionally drained.’

Ms Perrement made a formal complaint to the Care Quality Commission about the treatment her mother received at St Peter’s.

The complaint was referred to Suffolk 
County Council’s adult safeguarding team before Karen decided to seek 
advice from Ipswich-based Gotelee Solicitors.

‘My mother didn’t deserve to be treated the way she was, especially when it cost £1,500 for the fortnight,’ said Karen.

‘It
was a very traumatic experience for her and she has never really fully 
recovered. The care home was supposed to be protecting my mum and 
clearly that didn’t happen.’

Karen
filed a claim against County Care Homes, which runs St Peter’s, for 
breach of contract and/or negligence, injury and loss and damage.

County Care Homes, which runs St Peter's Residential Home, paid out £25,000 but did not admit liability

Among the particulars listed were that Mrs Perrement was not provided with sufficient fluids and that staff failed to seek medical advice for her deteriorating condition, failed to admit her to hospital and failed to take adequate care of her.

Ms Perrement settled a claim against County Care Homes for £25,000 in January.

Ms Perrement said that crucial lessons need to be urgently learned from her mother’s terrible experience.

‘Something has got to be done. If you make a mistake you’ve got to put your hands up and deal with it,’ she insisted.

‘What is paramount is protecting these vulnerable adults.’

Gareth Nixon-Moss, director of County 
Care Homes, said: ‘The home has been cleared of any neglect by all the 
professional authorities and this matter was treated as a nuisance claim
to avoid legal fees without accepting liability whatsoever.’

Julie Bateman, Suffolk County Council’s assistant director with responsibility for adult safeguarding, said: ‘I would urge anyone with concerns about the quality of care a friend or relative is receiving to report them immediately.

‘We take matters relating to safeguarding extremely seriously and will investigate whenever concerns are raised.

‘In relation to this particular case, the safeguarding team carried out a thorough investigation and identified some areas where the home could improve.

‘These were discussed in detail with the home and they took the necessary steps to improve their practice.’
