On Tuesday, the FBI released a warning, titled 'Advice for U.S. students studying abroad: Be Aware of Foreign Intelligence Threat.' On the webpage containing the advice is included an FBI-produced video called 'Game of Pawns'

The video as well as the FBI's new effort are in response ot the case of Glenn Duffie Shriver, a college student from Michigan who had studied in China. While there, he was courted by Chinese intelligence officers to provide national defense information to them. He received a total of $70,000 from 2005 through 2010 for his efforts.

In 2011, Shriver was sentenced to federal prison for four years for attempting to provide sensitive information to the Chinese.

'Game of Pawns' is a nearly 30-minute dramatic retelling of Shriver's story. In it, he is seen in Shanghai, excited to be studying abroad. He responds to a job ad to write political papers in a seemingly innocent job, but which is really a ploy to get him to engage in more sinister activities.

Later, he is seen meeting with a Chinese woman who then introduces him to a Chinese man, and Shriver ends up finding the allure of tens of thousands of dollars to spy for the chinese government an offer too good to pass up.

More than 280,000 American college students studied abroad last year, according to the Institute of International Education. The experience provides them with cultural opportunities, as well as langugage and leadership skills that make them more appealing to both the private sector and the U.S. government.

'But this same marketability makes these students tempting and vulnerable targets for recruitment by foreign intelligence officers whose long-term goal is to gain access to sensitive or classified U.S. information,' the FBI says.

The FBI warns that foreign intelligence officers would never claim they work as such when approaching a student. Rather, they first develop are relationship under seemingly harmless pretexts, such as an internship, writing assignments or cultural immersion program.

As the relationship grows, the officer may then ask to provide information, in exchange for money or another type of reward, with the demands growing over time. They also suggest that the student apply for U.S. government jobs when they graduate from college.

And that's exactly what happened to Shriver. After writing papers, the woman invited the man to meet some of her associates. That was when they suggested to have a 'friendship' and Shriver start applying for jobs with the federal government in the U.S.

Shriver ended up applying for jobs at the State Department and the CIA, the latter as a clandestine service officer. He eventually realized the associates were members of the Chinese intelligence service, but that doesn't stop Shriver from applying.

The FBI advises students to avoid 'money-for-nothing' offers, as well those that seem too good to be true. In addition, students should be skeptical of free favors, such as obtaining visa and work visas while abroad.

In addition, the FBI suggests students minimize information about themselves through social media and not engage in contact with people who are involved with the foreign government or might be involved in criminal activities.

'A keen awareness is the most powerful weapon [against being recruited],' Shriver warns students.
