Lionel Messi is the greatest player in the world, perhaps of all time, and after a few minor adjustments Argentina will be on their way to winning the World Cup.

That is how life looks inside the self-deceptive bubble which this Messi band of brothers inhabit.

Alejandro Sabella tells it thus: ‘Whatever Messi does or doesn’t do in this World Cup he is the greatest player in the world and one of the greatest in the history of football.’

Rare moment of quality: Messi celebrates his goal but before that he had an absolute nightmare

But then Senor Sabella is the manager of Argentina. And without a Messi brimming with confidence his team would have no better than an outside chance of reaching the final on July 13.

Messi the greatest player on the planet today?

Well, you could say he was for the duration of the 10 seconds it took him to collect the ball, dance past an assortment of Bosnia-Herzegovina defenders and fire his exceptional goal in off a post.

But for the 64 minutes which preceded that magical moment he had an absolute nightmare of a first game at Brazil 2014, running into opponents, losing the ball and looking up at the heavens as if trying to remind the almighty of his divine rights.

True enough Messi did play better after scoring but in objective realty not like one of the gods of the game.

The comparisons with his forefather Diego Maradona keep on coming but on this display they are an insult to the Argentine who once claimed that the Hand of God helped him beat England in one World Cup quarter-final.

Pele, Alfredo di Stefano and Garrincha are among others entitled to feel slighted.

This is not to deny that Messi is a terrific player and has the rare skills and intelligence to rise to the pantheon. But, as with any player blessed by birth to play for one of the major football powers, he needs his big World Cup to be anointed.

Whether that will happen here remains as up in the air as the French players when they were launched skywards by the hackers from Honduras.

Virtually all he did on Sunday night was emphasise how capable he is of scoring amazing goals. But in so doing he also reminded us that this is only his second in a World Cup.

He is in his prime right now and if he does not conquer Brazil - outshining the likes of Neymar, Pirlo, Van Persie and Robben in the process – then the clock will be ticking all the louder.

Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi's goalscoring records for Argentina

Maradona

91 games, 34 goals (1977-94)

Lionel Messi

87 games, 39 goals (2005-)

Messi will turn 27 the day before Argentina play Nigeria in their last group game.

Given that they are in an apparently less demanding section, he and his team-mates will presumably be in the mood to celebrate after that match.

How far they progress beyond that will depend not only on Sabella sorting out his tactics but whether they can bring their collective ego down to earth.

They should have been punished by the Bosnians in a ragged, disorganised first half, although they did improve when Sabella sent on a couple of decent substitutes and reverted to an orthodox back four.

Yet even in the closing stages, after Messi had put them two up, that old arrogance returned and they conceded one goal and almost threw the win away.

Insult: There is still no comparison between Messi and World Cup winner Diego Maradona

Argentinian God: Maradona, deified in his homeland, scores that controversial goal against England in 1986

Sabella admitted only: ‘Maybe we made one or two errors and I got one or two things wrong. But we will get better.’

Complacency is contagious in this camp but at least Messi did not appear too gravely affected when he observed: ‘Yes, we do have to improve.’

He can say that again. And he had better keep doing so if the tens of thousands of Argentines – some of whom managed to break into the Maracana without tickets on Sunday – are not to be disappointed.
