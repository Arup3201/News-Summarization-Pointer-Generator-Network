New York Red Bulls have pulled out all the stops to make Arsenal feel welcome on their first ever trip to New York.

The sides meet as part of the Gunners' pre-season tour of the United States on Saturday at the Red Bull Arena in New Jersey.

And the MLS side have made a video of their players attempting, badly, English accents in order to make the likes of Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey and Wojciech Szczesny feel at home.

Comedians: Chris Duvall and Eric Stevenson took part in the video parodying English accents

Connor Lade and Ryan Meara tried out phrases such as 'alright mate' and 'sweet guv'nor'

The video begins with a pre-roll which says: 'For the first time ever Arsenal are coming to New York so to make them feel welcome we have been speaking like them'.

Eric Stevenson, Chris Duvall, Connor Lade and Ryan Meara then give their best English accents an airing, trying out such famous cockney phrases as 'alright mate', 'are you having a laugh', 'sweet guv'nor', 'I'm bond, James Bond'.

The game will see Arsenal come up against club legend Thierry Henry who joined the Red Bulls in 2010.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger joked that he had hoped Henry might play one half for the Gunners, saying: 'I came here with only one striker because I hoped he would play one half for us. He practices with us and is still very sharp and he came back here in very good shape.'

Arsenal will also come up against former Everton midfielder Tim Cahill and ex-Manchester City and Southampton striker Bradley Wright-Phillips.
