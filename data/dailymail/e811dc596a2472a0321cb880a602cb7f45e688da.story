Business taxes in Britain will undercut the lowest rates in the developed world if the Conservatives win next year’s election, David Cameron pledged yesterday.

In one of the most striking commitments of his final conference speech before voters go to the polls, the Prime Minister guaranteed to keep corporation tax at the lowest level in the G20.

Chancellor George Osborne has already slashed the main rate of corporation tax to 21 per cent, down from 30 per cent in 2007.

He is due to cut it again next year, to 20 per cent. This would make Britain more competitive than China, which currently has the lowest business taxes in the G20 group of developed nations.

Rival economies in Europe – particularly Germany and France – have watched with growing dismay as Britain has sought to compete with low-tax countries.

A survey earlier this year revealed that 63 per cent of the 1,344 chief executives polled worldwide put government tax policy high on the agenda when choosing where to locate their business.

Economists say Britain’s tax breaks are attracting bigger international firms to do business here, spurring investment and protecting jobs.

Mr Cameron said the Government’s long- term economic plan had helped businesses create many more ‘decent jobs’.

‘Look how far we’ve come,’ he told the conference. ‘Today there are 1.8million more jobs in our country than there were in 2010.

‘We are creating more jobs here in Britain than in the whole of Europe put together. You know, when Britain is getting back to work, it can only mean one thing – the Conservatives are back in government.’

The Prime Minister said the Tories aimed to ensure the highest employment rate of any major economy so that all those who ‘can work are able to work’.

‘Standing on their own two feet, looking at their children and thinking “I am providing for you”. We can get there – but only if we stick to our plan.

‘Companies are coming from all over the world to invest and create jobs here. That’s not happened by accident.

‘It’s because they see a Government rolling out the red carpet for them, cutting their red tape, cutting their taxes.

‘So here is a commitment: with the next Conservative Government we will always have the most competitive corporate taxes in the G20 . . . lower than Germany, lower than Japan, lower than the United States.’

Samantha Cameron was moved to tears as her husband paid tribute to the NHS for the care it gave their late son Ivan.

The Prime Minister’s wife wept in the audience yesterday as he recalled their nights in hospital with their severely disabled child, who died in 2009 aged six.

Mr Cameron, whose eyes also appeared to fill with tears, accused Labour of ‘lies’ for claiming that the Tories are undermining the NHS.

A D-Day veteran was given a standing ovation by delegates after the Prime Minister said meeting him was the ‘best moment of my year’.

David Cameron met Patrick Churchill, pictured, who stormed the Normandy beaches with the Royal Marine commandos, in Bayeux at this summer’s 70th anniversary of the landings.

The 91-year-old, who was invited to the conference with his wife Karin, was visibly moved and said the tribute was ‘wonderful’.

The flipside, Mr Cameron said, would be measures to prevent multinational firms diverting profits offshore in order to dodge or minimise corporation tax. The Chancellor will unveil measures to stop companies transferring money between countries in order to pay less.

Firms including Google and Starbucks have been accused of adopting the tactic.

Mr Cameron said he had a ‘message to those global companies: we have cut your taxes – now you must pay what you owe’.

Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Keeping corporation tax at the lowest level in the G20 is a powerful and tangible commitment to promoting Britain as a place to do business.

‘However, whilst it’s also right that companies operating here pay their fair share of tax, clamping down on egregious tax avoidance must coincide with a radical simplification of the tax code. Taxes must be simpler, as well as lower.’

John Cridland, head of the Confederation of British Industry, said: ‘We need more investment to create more jobs, so pledging to keep the UK corporate tax rate the most competitive in the G20 will send out a clear positive signal to businesses.’

Terry Scuoler, of manufacturers’ organisation EEF, said: ‘Business will be delighted by the PM’s commitment to maintain low corporate taxes.’
