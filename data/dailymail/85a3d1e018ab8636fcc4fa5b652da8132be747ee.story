Formula One heiress Tamara Ecclestone
 has lost a court battle against her ex-boyfriend after a judge ruled 
that she was wrong to try and reclaim a Lamborghini supercar she gave 
him as a present.

The 
wealthy socialite must now pay more than £20,000 in compensation to two 
car companies who were prevented from selling the vehicle while the case
 was ongoing.

Mr 
Justice Dingemans said in a High Court judgement yesterday that the 
wrangling over the £380,000 Lamborghini Aventador had 'caused everyone 
far more trouble than it is worth'.

Ms Ecclestone said she was 'disappointed' by the ruling - but today she was pictured in a Lamborghini showroom in Kensington, West London, apparently shopping for a replacement.

The 29-year-old gave the original car
 to her then-lover Omar Khyami on his 38th birthday in April 2012, but 
when they broke up three months later she claimed it belonged to her.

Mr
 Khyami, a former stockbroker, used the Lamborghini to secure a loan 
from Elite Performance Cars Ltd in connection with a white Bentley which
 he bought Ms Ecclestone for Christmas in 2011.

In April 2013, bailiffs acting on behalf of Elite seized the car from a garage where Ms Ecclestone was having it serviced.

The
 firm sold the vehicle to Ansol Trading Ltd, which apparently arranged 
to sell it on to a buyer in Turkey until the heiress obtained a High 
Court injunction stopping the sale on the grounds that she had never 
actually given the Lamborghini to Mr Khyami.

Walking out: It was unclear whether or not Ms Ecclestone made a purchase during her trip to the showroom

In a written judgement delivered in 
Newcastle yesterday, Mr Justice Dingemans said that Ms Ecclestone was 
wrong to interfere and did not own the car.

He
 ruled that she should pay Elite £7,500 in damages, while Ansol was 
awarded £15,000 as well as the Lamborghini and an amount of interest 
which has yet to be determined.

'Ms
 Ecclestone's conduct was wrongful and interfered with the title and 
possession by Elite and Ansol by interfering with sales made by Elite 
and Ansol, and by removing the car, and by preventing dealings with the 
proceeds of the sale of the car,' the judge said.

'The
 injunctions obtained by Ms Ecclestone were wrongfully granted, because 
they were obtained on the basis of false evidence to the effect the car 
had not been a gift to Mr Khyami.'

The
 car is currently being stored by the heiress' father Bernie Ecclestone,
 who faces his own court case after being indicted on charges of bribery
 in Germany. He denies any wrongdoing.

Elite
 argued Ms Ecclestone's allegation that the company was prepared to sell
 a car it did not own had damaged its reputation, and cost it £440,000 
in lost profits, but the judge rejected that claim.

After
 the verdict, a spokesman for Ms Ecclestone said: 'Tamara is 
disappointed by this verdict and she absolutely maintains that the 
vehicle was never intended to be a gift.

'We
 are, however, relieved the spurious counter claim brought against 
Tamara by Elite Performance Cars was dismissed by the judge.

'The
 judge was correct when he said the car had been more trouble than its 
worth and this has been a difficult time for Tamara and her family.  
Tamara thanks everyone for their support and it is now time to focus on 
the future and positive times ahead.'

Ms
 Ecclestone and Mr Khyami dated for two and a half years, but they split
 after claims emerged that Mr Khyami had been filmed having sex with 
other women.

New partner: Ms Ecclestone pictured earlier this month with her husband Jay Rutland

Yesterday's ruling was the second legal setback the socialite had received in just a few days, after prosecutors decided to drop charges against a man accused of mugging her husband Jay Rutland.

The 32-year-old was seen on CCTV grappling with an attacker, but he was later unable to identify the culprit and the Crown Prosecution Service has now concluded that there is insufficient evidence linking him with the alleged crime to continue proceedings.
