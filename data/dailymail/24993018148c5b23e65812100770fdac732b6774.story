The U.S. Air Force's top secret unmanned space plane which has been circling Earth for ten months may be spying on China's space laboratory, it was claimed today.

The secretive X-37B space plane launched into Earth's orbit last year, with the Air Force revealing few details about its course or when the plane will return.

But onlookers studying the spy plane's path now believe the space craft may be spying on China's new space station, Tiangong-1, in the latest bout of orbital accusations exchanged between the two nations.

Experts claim the U.S. plane could be spying on China's space program after it was noted that the two space craft's have closely matched orbits.

The mission of the X-37B space plane was extended at the end of last year after it spent nine months orbiting the Earth, with a new landing date yet to be set.

The claims that the U.S. craft may be snooping on Chinese space activity were made in Spaceflight magazine.

Spaceflight editor, Dr. David Baker told the BBC, told the BBC: 'Space-to-space surveillance is a whole new ball game made possible by a finessed group of sensors and sensor suites, which we think the X-37B may be using to maintain a close watch on China's nascent space station.'

'The parallels with X-37B [and Tiangong-1] are clear.

'With a period differential of about 19 seconds, the two vehicles will migrate toward or against each other, converging or diverging, roughly every 170 orbits.'

Claims that the U.S. could be spying on Chinese space activity come in the wake of cyberhacking allegations made against China at the end of last year.

China was accused of interfering with two U.S. government satellites in one of its most advanced hacking operations to date.

On four occasions between 2007 and 2008 Chinese agents are said to have breached security on the environment-monitoring craft.

The 29-foot, solar-powered craft had an original mission of 270 days and had been due to land at the same base last month.

The X-37B's official task is to test new spaceflight technologies, but some nations have speculated abouts its potential military capabilities.

Iran's PressTV called the craft a 'secret space warplane', while space experts and technical advisers have also echoed the same opinion.

Brian Weeden, a technical adviser to the Secure World Foundation and a former orbital analyst with the U.S. Air Force, told Space.com early last year: 'As we know through experience, everything and anything about them [the NRO] is classified.'

'A typical spy satellite is in a polar orbit, which gives you access to the whole Earth.

'The X-37B is in a much lower inclination which means it can only see a very narrow band of latitudes - and the only thing that's of real interest in that band is the Middle East and Afghanistan.'
