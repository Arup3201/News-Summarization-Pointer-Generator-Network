Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm?

After Uruguay's star man Luis Suarez appeared to bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini, the football world has reacted with some fans claiming the frontman should be banned for the rest of the World Cup.

With Uruguay and Italy drawing with ten minutes to go, Suarez appeared to take a chomp at Chiellini's shoulder before rolling to the ground holding his face. Suarez was seen grimacing in pain and holding his teeth.

As Uruguay went on to win the game courtesy of a Diego Godin just minutes later to progress from Group D, calls were made for Suarez to be banned for the rest of this summer's tournament in Brazil.

Everton 
boss Roberto Martinez, working as a pundit on ESPN with former 
Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, reportedly said: 'This is behaviour 
that's happened two times. You cannot justify it. I seriously think he 
needs help.

'If you cannot control yourself in those moments, you need some sort of help because that's just unacceptable on a football pitch.'

'We can't celebrate (the game). We can't talk about what Uruguay did. We can't talk about why Mario Balotelli didn't come on in the second half.

'It's about how Luis Suarez is allowed to play the game without carrying that responsibility that you have as a player, being a role model to the younger generation. You cannot justify it.'   

Strong opinion: Everton manager Roberto Martinez believes Liverpool frontman Suarez needs help

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker took to Twitter to tweet about the incident and said: 'Suarez has bitten Chiellini!!!

'Two minutes later Godin gives Uruguay the lead. Suarez incident was not seen by the ref, but appears to be a bite.'

Lineker
 later retweeted comedian Russell Brand, who, having appeared on Match 
of the Day for Sport Relief in March, joked: 'Suarez! Your teeth are 
already prominent, stop biting people! It's like GaryLineker attacking 
people with his ears.'

Sportsmail columnist and former England defender Rio Ferdinand said: ''Tell me Suarez didn't eat someone....was the hero a couple of days ago.'

Meanwhile, Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick appeared shocked at what he had seen and tweeted in disbelief: 'Surely that wasn't a bite???
It can't have been...could it??'

Hull striker Shane Long was also in shock and said: 'Can't believe he's done it again! What a player but wow, scandalous!'
