A social media filter that can identify risky comments or photos and urge people to reconsider what they post could stop sporting stars from being embroiled in online scandals.

The real-time monitoring technology has been developed for sporting clubs in a bid to stop players from posting 'inappropriate stuff' on social media that can often tarnish a sport's brand.

Former Cronulla Sharks player Todd Carney was the latest NRL player to be disgraced after he was sacked earlier this month when a photo of him urinating in his mouth was published on social media.

Sydney-based company, Kudos Knowledge, developed the filter to pick up risky information on Facebook and Twitter and has the potential to alert a third party like a sport club administrator.

The technology will focus on the 'indiscretion' of sport stars but will also be implemented at high schools to try and stamp out online bullying. It will undergo its first trial at Sydney's Matraville Sports High School next month.

Moderating tools can recognise risky posts that contain blacklisted words or phrases or if it is posted at a particular time of day, for example 1am to 5am.

The Facebook or Twitter post is then automatically stalled while an alert is sent to the person about its offensive nature and asks them to reconsider posting it.

Costly: NRL player Josh Dugan's career was almost prematurely ended when after a long string of trouble, he told a Canberra Raiders fan to kill himself on Instagram last year

The post can then be deleted, modified or the warning can be ignored.

'There's an optimistic hope that it will shift behaviours so players think about what they're posting on social media,' Carlton Taya, the director of Kudos Knowledge, told Daily Mail Australia.

'Hopefully this will be a solution that deals with inappropriate stuff being put out there by sporting players.'

The Brisbane Broncos famously dropped contract negotiations with NRL player Josh Dugan last year after he told a Canberra Raiders fan on social media to kill himself. 

West Tigers captain Robbie Farah was also forced to apologise to former Prime Minister Julia Gillard in 2012 after one of his deleted tweets resurfaced, which said Ms Gillard should be given a noose for her 50th birthday.

Mr Taya said his company had been in talks with sporting clubs for the past six months about implementing the technology.

'We saw a need for clubs who are concerned about damage to their brand. You think about it, the sporting clubs are very positive about it,' he said.

'There’s no big brother there looking at you, it’s just monitoring and moderating.'

Developers are also working on an image function where skin-coloured pixels could flag nudity, or the shapes of weapons could be identified.

This could then be used to target Instagram posts and apps like Snapchat.

In 2013, George Burgess joined the list of NRL players who have had explicit material of themselves posted on Twitter

The technology already has risky key words programmed to help moderate, but sporting clubs or schools would be able to determine exactly what should be filtered.

'Bullying has now become the number one issue in schools. So it’s more about teaching students about what they should or should not be posting,' Mr Taya said.

'If a user is being called a particular name online, that keyword could be loaded into the system and then any post referencing that particular word would be filtered or blocked.

'You can keep loading in more keywords, depending on what the bullies are saying or the victims are experiencing.'

The technology, which developers say is teaching a computer to understand the mean behind human actions, took 2.5 years of research and development.

Josh Bootsma used social media to inappropriately message a 15-year-old fan and sent explicit Snapchat messages

The list of Australian athletes and sportspeople who have courted controversy on social media is long and diverse.

In June AFL player Josh Bootsma sent a string of lurid messages to a young fan just 15 minutes after connecting with her on social media - propositioning her for sex and sending explicit Snapchat messages. As a result, the 21-year-old was later sacked by his club Carlton.

English-born South Sydney Rabbitohs NRL player George Burgess was at the centre of a naked selfie scandal, when two photos of him completely naked made it onto Twitter last June, although he escaped unscathed with no action taken against him by his club or the NRL.

But not all the sportspeople and athletes that have caused a stir on social media have come from football leagues.

Controversial swimmer Nick D'arcy and Kenrick Monk caused an uproar when a photo of the pair holding guns in a U.S. gun store was posted on Facebook and Twitter.

The swimmers were on an Olympic team camp in California before the 2012 London Olympics when the photo was taken.

Calling the photo 'inappropriate' and 'foolish', Swimming Australia investigated the incident and ordered the photos to be taken down, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. 

As punishment, both swimmers were sent home from the London Olympics by the Australian Olympic Committee as soon as their swimming events finished and they were also banned from using social media during the games.

Swimming's former pinup girl Stephanie Rice also faced intense public backlash after calling the South African rugby team 'f*****s' on Twitter in September 2010.

The tweet was made on the back of a rugby union game, which saw the Wallabies beat South Africa's Sprigboks. 'Suck on that f*****s. Probs the best game I've ever seen!! Well done boys,' she posted.

Following the controversy around the offensive tweet, Rice held a press conference where she offered a public apology.

Crying during the conference, Rice called her comments 'a huge error of language and judgement' but the outcry saw her dumped by sponsor Jaguar.

Former Canberra Raiders player Joel Monaghan was left disgraced when a photo of him simulating a sex act with a dog was posted on Twitter.

The image was reportedly taken during the Raider's post-season Mad Monday celebrations in 2010.

At the time then-NRL chief executive David Gallop said expressed his shock and even the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) commented on the disturbing nature of the image.

Following the incident, Monaghan left the club and now plays in Europe.

The New Zealand Warriors' Konrad Hurrell was embroiled in a Snapchat sex video scandal, when a video of the NRL player and a woman later identified as New Zealand soap star Teuila Blakely, appeared on social media.

The Warriors and the NRL integrity unit investigated the incident and both Hurrell and Blakey claimed they did not know how the video was uploaded in May this year.

Reportedly taken as a private video two months before being leaked, it features Blakely performing a sex act on Hurrell while he drives a car.

It was later posted and went viral on Instagram after being shared with a friend, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
