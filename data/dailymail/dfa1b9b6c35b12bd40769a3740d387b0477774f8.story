 

Even though she was 19 and he was 45, sultry Lauren Bacall and gritty Humphrey Bogart were meant for each other.

But they were meant for others too. Throughout their marriage Bogie carried on an affair with a Mexican starlet turned secretary. And Bacall - known as Betty to their pals - fell madly in love with Frank Sinatra and began a steamy relationship with him while Bogie was on his death bed with throat cancer.

Bacall, who died at her home in Los Angeles on Tuesday of a stroke, fell in with a fast crowd when she wed Bogart.

‘I knew everybody because I was married to Bogie, and that 25-year difference was the most fantastic thing for me to have in my life,' she said. The most famous actors, writers, artists were now in her inner circle because of they sought out her husband.

Ring a ding ding: Lauren Bacall began her tumultuous affair with Frank Sinatra when Humphrey Bogart was dying of cancer. They went public with their romance after Bogie died

Bogie and Bacall formed a group they called the Holmby Hills Rat Pack – a branch of the famed Las Vegas tribe, named after the neighborhood bordering Beverly Hills and Bel Air. It was a tight inner circle of stars dedicated to drinking, laughing and partying into the wee hours.

Sinatra was pack master; Judy Garland, first vice-president; Sid Luft, Judy’s husband, the cage master; superagent Irving ‘Swifty’ Lazar was recording secretary; novelist Nathaniel Benchley, historian; and Bacall, den mother. They were constantly together.

Once, after a New Year’s party in Palm Springs, Bacall, known as ‘Betty’, wanted she and Bogie to stay and hang out with Frank, since the blue-eyed crooner did not have a woman with him that night. 

Bogie insisted they go home and told her, ’You must always remember we have a life of our own that has nothing to do with Frank. He chose to live the way he’s living – alone. It’s too bad if he’s lonely, but that’s his choice. We have our road to travel, never forget that – we can’t live his life’, writes biographer Kitty Kelley.

When Bogie learned he had throat cancer in February 1956, the diagnosis, surgery and radiation came too late and one of Hollywood’s biggest stars was told he had less than a year to live.

Sinatra, came to visit him frequently, kept him laughing by recounting the practical jokes going on with the other Rat Pack members.

Out and about: Betty and Frank were seen together at restaurants, premieres, dinner parties and weekends in Palm Springs. She was deeply in love and wanted to marry him

‘It wasn’t easy for him,’ Kelley quotes Bacall. ‘I don’t think he could bear to see Bogie that way or bear to face the possibility of his death. Yet he cheered Bogie up when he was with him – made him laugh – kept the ring-a-ding act in high gear for him’.

Sinatra worshipped Bogart but there was also something brewing between the singer and Bacall.

They were falling in love while Bogie was dying of cancer.

By October, eight months later, to celebrate Bacall’s thirty-second birthday, Frank sent a chartered plane to Los Angeles to fly some of their closest friends to the Sands in Vegas where he was playing at the time. Bogie chose to stay in Los Angeles and spend it with his son.

‘He was somewhat jealous of Frank’, Bacall admitted. ‘Partly because he knew I loved being with him, partly because he thought Frank was in love with me, and partly because our physical life together, which had always ranked high, had less than flourished with his illness’.

‘This was the closest Bacall ever came to admitting her passion for Frank during the time that her husband was dying,' writes Kelley.

‘It was no secret to any of us’, said playwright Ketti Frings. ‘Everybody knew about Betty and Frank. We just hoped Bogie wouldn’t find out. That would have been more killing than throat cancer’.

When Bogart died in January 1957, Frank was performing at the Copa nightclub in New York. He cancelled his appearances but did not fly to the West Coast for the funeral of the man he had adored. ‘He pleaded laryngitis, but close friends suspected that he had developed a crippling case of ‘the guilt germs’.

Soon their love affair was out in the open and Betty and Frank were seen about town, at premieres, dinner parties and weekends in Palm Springs.

Smooth sailing: Until Bogart was diagnosed with lung cancer in February 1956 the couple were deliriously happy.  Bacall admitted that they had a great sex life until he got sick

Mistress: Verita Bouvair Thompson, who traveled with Bogart as his personal secretary, bartender and hairdresser, held two of Bogie's secrets - he wore a toupee.  She was his mistress for seventeen years and wrote about their love story in her 1982 book Bogie and Me

‘It seemed to everyone --- to his friends, to mine – that we were crazy about each other, that we were a great pair; that it wouldn’t last; that Frank would never be able to remain constantly devoted, monogamous – yet that maybe with me, he would’, Betty said.

What followed was months of an ‘erratic’ courtship with Frank - wildly attentive one minute and distant the next.

He didn’t want any woman telling him what to do and Bacall admitted she wasn’t one to mildly suggest anything. She was deeply in love with the crooner and wanted to marry him. On the evening of March 11, 1958, fourteen months after her husband’s death, Frank proposed.

They celebrated by going to the Imperial Gardens restaurant on Sunset Boulevard with agent and friend, Swifty Lazar. When a young girl approached the table asking for autographs, Sinatra urged her to sign ‘Betty Sinatra’.

He was off to a gig in Miami the next day and Bacall went to the theatre with Lazar where a newspaper columnist asked her about an impending marriage. She admitted the truth and by the next morning, the world knew when the morning paper’s early edition headlines read: SINATRA TO MARRY BACALL.

That was the death knell for the relationship. Sinatra was livid when she phoned him in Miami. When he finally returned her call days later, he said he was besieged with reporters and couldn’t leave his hotel room.

That was the last time Bacall heard from Sinatra. ‘He didn’t speak to her again for six years, and then only in rage’. When asked about the marriage, his only reply was ‘Marriage? What for? Just so I’d have to go home earlier every night? Nuts!’

When actress Ava Gardner, Sinatra's first wife, called him from Spain, he told her, ‘Jesus. I was never going to marry that pushy female’.

Bacall’s response to the too-brief engagement was to call him ‘a s***’ and suggest she was so insecure at the time it was pathetic.

For years, Bacall never escaped the perception of the great love affair between her and Humphrey Bogart even when she married her second husband, Jason Robards.

She also never escaped the revelation that Bogart had a mistress throughout their marriage.

Verita Bouvair Thompson, who traveled with Bogart as his personal secretary, bartender and hairdresser, held two of Bogie’s secrets – he wore a toupee and she was his mistress for seventeen years.

The Mexican starlet met Bogart at an after party for Casablanca in 1942, two years before he met Bacall. Thompson had established herself in Hollywood as an expert on toupees, preparing hairpieces for George Raft, Ray Milland and Gary Cooper – as well as Bogart.

Bogie didn’t like to dance, but honey, we danced the night away and from that day on we were lovers’, she stated.

'It’s hard for people to accept that Bogie and Bacall myth wasn’t really what it was’, according to Dean Shapiro, a writer and Thompson’s boyfriend. ‘They were supposed to be this great Hollywood couple, but Bogie was carrying on with Verita on the side. They did a lot of crazy things together’.

Bacall had a secret of her own when she came to Hollywood. She was a nice Jewish girl but concealed it.

‘There was anti-Semitism in Hollywood and I was terribly frightened. I was nineteen and wasn’t exactly swimming in self confidence. It’s one area of my life I am not proud of’.

When she fell in love with Bogart, she made sure he knew but then he was the last man on earth who would have cared.

Bacall lived her life out at a luxurious, cavernous apartment on a high floor of the Dakota, the grand residential building overlooking Central Park on Manhattan’s Upper West side where John Lennon was living when he was shot down by David Chapman in 1980.

She often ventured out always wearing all black, a black shirt, black pants and black orthopedic shoes – always accompanied by her ‘friend’, her aluminum walker with tennis balls on its feet.Still outspoken and feisty in her final years.

After Bacall’s marriage to Jason Robards broke down because of his drinking, she was linked with James Garner, the ruggedly handsome star of Rockford Files, during his second separation from his wife in 1979. Garner died just a month before Bacall.
