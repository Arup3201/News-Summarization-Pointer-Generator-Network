David Haye has confirmed he is planning a return to the ring in the autumn.

The former heavyweight world champion has not fought since he knocked out Dereck Chisora at Upton Park almost two years ago.

Haye twice pulled out of a fight with Tyson Fury through injury and had surgery on his shoulder last November which looked to have forced him into retirement.

But the 33-year-old's trainer Adam Booth admitted last week that his charge was eyeing a comeback.

And Haye told iFL TV: 'I'll have nights in the future to talk about.

'If I was a betting man, I'd bet that I'll fight in September or October.'

Haye was at Wembley on Saturday night as Carl Froch knocked out George Groves in their Battle of Britain rematch.

Froch send the Londoner crashing to the canvas in the eighth round to retain his IBF and WBA super-middleweight world titles.

Haye initially retired from the sport in 2011 after losing to Wladimir Klitschko in Germany but after a brawl with Chisora in Munich in February 2012, he settled the score with his British rival in east London.
