Sunrise weather presenter Edwina Bartholomew was made to fly with budget airline Jetstar to and from Hawaii last week while the rest of her colleagues were living it up on a Qantas plane.

The Channel Seven breakfast crew were also all met by drivers when they arrived back in Sydney after the week-long broadcasting stint in Hawaii - but Bartholomew had to hail her own cab, Sydney Confidential reports.

Hosts Samantha Armytage and David Koch were joined by newsreader Natalie Barr and sport presenter Mark Beretta on-board the Qantas flight last week as they posed for photos with airline staff.

Sunrise weather girl Edwina Bartholomew was made to fly with budget airline Jetstar to and from Hawaii last week while the rest of her colleagues were living it up on a Qantas plane

But the hard working weather girl was nowhere to be seen.

Bartholomew, who also co-hosts Seven's Dancing With The Stars, is reportedly now considered the most popular personality amongst the Sunrise crew and is even favoured to replace Armytage down the track.

Channel Seven insist Bartholomew's bump to Jetstar wasn't deliberate.

'Edwina and her crew travelled via Jetstar, as they do each week, wherever their locations take them... it's an ongoing, week in week out arrangement,' a Seven spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

'It’s a big broadcast and camera kit that has to travel with them.'

'Everyone makes their own plans on arrivals back into Sydney. Edwina chose the taxi option. Others made their own arrangements.'

Bartholomew spent her week in Hawaii taking helicopter rides over Hilton Big Island and having stand up paddle board lessons with six-time world champion Kai Lenny.

The program welcomed a slew of musical talent for its week-long stint, including Carly Rae Jepsen and Timomatic.

The country's first Eurovision contestant, Guy Sebastian and dance group, Justice Crew also performed on the show, while US girl band G.R.L sang their hit single 'Ugly Heart' live on the beach.

Having only been back in Sydney a few days, Bartholomew posted a photo to Instagram on Monday saying she was enroute to Vanuatu after the deadly Cylcone Pam tore through.
