An Australian woman who has received multiple online rape threats from teenage boys has taken action against her abusers by tracking down their mothers and showing them the offensive and often violent messages that the youngsters sent her.

Alanah Pearce, a gaming journalist from Brisbane, has thus far received just one reply from the four messages that she sent and admits that the woman responded 'in almost exactly the way' she wanted her to. 

'She responded in almost exactly the way I wanted her to,' she told the Guardian. 'The fact she called him a little s**t I found funny as well because I thought that but I wasn't going to say anything.'

Fighting back: Alanah Pearce told the Guardian that she hopes her abusers' mothers will teach them that being abusive or sexist towards women is wrong

Sending a clear message: Only one of the four mothers than Alanah contacted has responded - and was understandably horrified to learn about the messages her son had sent

The 21-year-old posted the full response on Twitter, where she has received an overwhelming amount of support from both men and women, many of whom have congratulated her on tackling the issue in such a hands-on way. 

'I wasn’t going to post it on Twitter [either] but I was just so excited,' she added. 'And I thought some of my friends would find it amusing.'

So far, the image, which is accompanied by the explanation, 'Sometimes young boys on Facebook send me rape threats, so I've started telling their mothers' has been retweeted more than 19,000 times and has been favorited by 32,000 people.

Ms Pearce, who reviews video games for radio stations 4ZZZ and Triple J, as well as creating content for her own YouTube channel, hopes that her actions will 'productively' teach the young boys that there is never a valid reason to be sexist or abusive, and that the internet should not be used as a forum for such harmful sentiments.

It is not the first time that the YouTuber has attempted to tackle online sexism. 

Last year, Ms Pearce penned a piece for gaming site Kotaku, entitled '30 Days of Sexism' in which she listed some of the most offensive and sexist comments that were made about her videos. 

'From March 7 – April 7, I documented everything blatantly sexist anyone has said to me,' she wrote. 

'None of these comments were provoked, none of them were replies to something I said, none of them were at all out of the ordinary... 

'This is a 10-picture indication of what it’s like to be a woman who endorses game culture, every single month.'
