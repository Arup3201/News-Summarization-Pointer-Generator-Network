MY AGE OF ANXIETY by Scott Stossel (Windmill £8.99)

Think you’re one of life’s worriers? Step aside for Scott Stossel. As the editor of one of the world’s most prestigious magazines, The Atlantic, he is an alpha male in real life, but in the world of anxiety, he’s the alpha’s alpha.

He says he is ‘buffeted by worry’. On ordinary days, doing ordinary things, he is regularly stricken by ‘a pervasive sense of existential dread’. He is overwhelmed by nausea and vertigo, stomach aches and headaches. He starts to shake uncontrollably. He sweats to the point of dehydration. Occasionally, as when his wife was giving birth to their first child, he passes out.

He has some phobias too. Enclosed spaces (claustrophobia). Heights (acrophobia). Fainting (asthenophobia). Being trapped far from home (a species of agoraphobia). Germs (bacillophobia). Cheese (turophobia). Speaking in public (a sub-category of social phobia). Flying (aerophobia). Vomiting (emetophobia). And, of course, vomiting on aeroplanes (aeronausiphobia). He has tried everything: every imaginable type of therapy, meditation, acupuncture, yoga, alcohol and 27 named drugs.

None of it has made any difference. So, as a last resort, it seems, he has written about his anxiety. His therapist, Dr W, thinks it might work. Or at least, he tells Scott Stossel he thinks it might work.

This is a big shambling splurge of a book, partly a quasi-academic history of the subject, partly a scientific investigation, and partly a record of Stossel’s own extreme fretfulness. We are, he says, more anxious than ever before, and: ‘Though some have argued that anxiety is a particularly American affliction, it’s not just Americans who suffer from it.’ According to one report, 15 per cent of Britons suffer from an anxiety disorder of some kind, and 37 per cent of us say we are more frightened than we used to be. The world is going mad with worry.

It’s not new, though. In the fourth century BC Hippocrates recorded that one of his patients was terrified of cats. Rather later, Freud used his acute fear of trains to construct his theory of psychoanalysis, while Darwin was housebound by stress-related illnesses after the voyage of the Beagle.

But what is anxiety exactly? How do we distinguish it from full-blooded depression? Stossel likes his therapist’s definition, and so do I. ‘Anxiety,’ writes Dr W, ‘is apprehension about future suffering — the fearful anticipation of an unbearable catastrophe one is helpless to prevent.’ For Dr W, the defining characteristic of anxiety is that it’s geared towards the future.

Animals have no abstract concept of the future: they can experience fear, but not anxiety. In the U.S, of course, mental health is a multi-billion-dollar industry. Anxiety has become a battleground between the big pharamaceutical corporations, which seek to medicate everyone with highly profitable drugs, and the traditional holistic approach of therapists, who argue that merely talking about it will do far more good.

At the heart of all this is an old, old argument: is nature or nurture to blame? Are we genetically programmed to become anxious, or did our upbringing give us all the lessons we needed?

The actor Richard Burton could not bear to be in the same room as honey, even if it was sealed in a jar, even if the jar was shut in a drawer

Not wishing to blame his parents, Stossel seems drawn to the genetic argument, but he acknowledges that the true answer is six of one, half a dozen of the other.

His own story is really something, though. Stossel has a pathological fear of vomiting, even though the last time he threw up was March 17, 1977.

An astonishing proportion of his life since has been spent trying to avoid being sick and preparing for the eventuality that he might.

Stossel is a pro. He steals sickbags from aircraft and stashes them all over his home, car and office, just in case.

He carries anti-emetic medication everywhere he goes. And, ‘like a general monitoring the enemy’s advance’, he keeps a detailed mental map of incidences of norovirus and other stomach bugs, using the internet to track outbreaks all over the world.

One day he complains to his father that there is no central clearing house for information about norovirus outbreaks the way there is for influenza. ‘Yes there is,’ interjects his wife. ‘You.’

My Age Of Anxiety also teems with glorious stories. (The actor Richard Burton could not bear to be in the same room as honey, even if it was sealed in a jar, even if the jar was shut in a drawer.) It’s a book so deranged in its intensity, you end up feeling remarkably sane and well-adjusted.
