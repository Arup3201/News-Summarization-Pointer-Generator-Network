Beer is one of the world's most ancient brews and has played an essential role in society - both for its nutritional and ritual importance - for millennia.

Now, 5,000-year-old fragments of pottery used by ancient Egyptians to make beer, have been discovered on a building site in Tel Aviv, Israel.

The pottery shards come from large ceramic basins, which were used to prepare fruity beer that was left to ferment under the sun.

‘Among the hundreds of pottery shards (pictured) that characterise the local culture, a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an Egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer,’ Dr Barkan said

Diego Barkan, of the Israeli Antiquities Authority, said that 17 pits were found that had been used to store produce in the Early Bronze Age, from 3,500 to 3,000 BC.

Beer was the favourite drink of humans and gods in ancient Egypt.

It was also drank by rich and poor, adults and children.

This was because it was cleaner than water, which came from a river or canal and was often polluted.

Beer was considered as staple, along with bread, Reshafim.org reported. 

Workers were paid with bread, oil, beer and vegetables by their employers.

The standard ration was two jars containing three-and-a-half pints (two litres) of beer.

Just like today, the Egyptians liked their beer cooled and kept jars in water.

‘Among the hundreds of pottery shards that characterise the local culture, a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an Egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer,’ he said in a statement.

The vessels were made with ‘straw temper’ and other organic material to strengthen them – a method which was not in local potteries.

The excavation is the first to offer evidence of an ‘Egyptian occupation’ in the centre of Tel Aviv 5,000 years ago.

As well as the basins, a bronze dagger and 6,000-year-old flint tools were uncovered.

Dr Barken said: ‘This is also the northernmost evidence we have of an Egyptian presence in the early Bronze Age.

‘Until now we were only aware of an Egyptian presence in the northern Negev and southern coastal plain, whereby the northernmost point of Egyptian occupation occurred in Azor.

Last year, the tomb of a leading ancient Egyptian beer brewer was discovered.

The tomb of Khonso Em Heb, who lived 3,200 years ago, was found by a Japanese team and has been been described as 'one of the most important discoveries' made at the Thebes necropolic site in the city of Luxor.

Egypt's antiquities minister Mohamed Ibrahim described Khonso Em Heb as the chief ‘maker of beer for gods of the dead'.

He was thought to be the head of a warehouse and judging by the decorations in his tomb was an important and wealthy man.

The walls of the tomb contain paintings showing everyday life and rituals.

‘Now we know that they also appreciated what the Tel Aviv region had to offer and that they too knew how to enjoy a glass of beer, just as Tel Avivians do today’.

According to the antiquities authority, ‘beer was the Egyptian national drink and was a staple along with bread.’ 

It said beer was consumed by the entire population of Egypt, regardless of age, gender or status.

‘It was made from a mixture of barley and water that was partially baked and then left to ferment in the sun.

‘Various fruit concentrates were added to this mixture in order to flavour the beer.’

The mixture was filtered in special vessels before serving.

Previous excavations carried out in Egypt's Delta region uncovered breweries that indicate beer was already being produced in the mid-fourth millennium BC, the Israeli authority said. 

The fragments were discovered in pits on Ha-Masger Street in central Tel Aviv (marked on the map). Excavations are taking place before the construction of an office building
