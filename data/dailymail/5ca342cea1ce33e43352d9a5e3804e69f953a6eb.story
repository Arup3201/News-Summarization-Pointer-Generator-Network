Migrant parents care more about their children’s education than those from white working-class backgrounds, Ofsted’s chief said yesterday.

Sir Michael Wilshaw attacked the mothers and fathers who failed to support their youngsters with homework and reading after school.

Pupils from migrant, black and Asian families were getting more backing at home – and it is helping them outperform their white classmates, he said.

Sir Michael told the BBC’s Today programme: ‘Family is important and we need to send a message out to parents that they need to support their children.

Brits

There are parts of our communities – 
particularly people from immigrant groups, ethnic minority groups, where
 their children are doing fantastically well because their parents 
support them.’

Former head teacher Sir Michael has previously called  for parents to be fined for not helping children with their homework.

Reiterating the demand yesterday, he said: ‘If parents don’t support their children and do badly there should be sanctions.

'I think it’s important that families and parents support the school.’

His comments tally with a recent Commons’ education select committee report warning that the under-achievement of white working-class pupils is ‘quite staggeringly low’.

Research last year by the Centre for Social Justice revealed that in 2012, only 26 per cent of poor white British boys gained five A* to C grades at GCSE including English and maths.

But 40 per cent of black boys achieved the same result, against a country-wide figure of 63 per cent.

And earlier this week an immigrant mother wrote in the Mail how Asian values could prevent indigenous British children performing badly by understanding how learning can pave the way to a better life.

Later yesterday, at the Festival of Education at Wellington College, Berkshire, Sir Michael warned that thousands of pupils were being let down by the ‘baleful legacy’ of trendy teaching methods and poor discipline at ‘bog standard’ comprehensives.

The pervasiveness of 1960s and 70s teaching methods meant state secondaries were associated with ‘mediocrity, laxity and failure’, he said.

Its fallout could be seen in the toleration of poor behaviour, the ‘disdain’ for competitive sports and the ‘half-hearted pursuit’ of high academic standards.

Singling out the once-fashionable concept of ‘individualised learning’ – the belief that criticism and adult supervision stifle youthful creativity – he said: ‘Its legacy still lingers in some schools today: academic rigour is undervalued; basic literacy and numeracy are neglected; subject specialism is relegated in favour of cross-curricula muddle.’

Weak head teachers who remain resistant to academic rigour and the importance of tests were also attacked. Sir Michael insisted that good leadership was essential in ‘the battle against tired ideologies and harmful classroom practices’.

Head teachers must insist that the curriculum is ‘academically robust’ and confront parents who refuse to take responsibility for their children, such as flouting uniform rules.

He now wants to ‘reclaim the comprehensive ideal’, insisting that it is the only approach to ‘address the educational needs of the entire country’.

He added: ‘Phrases such as “behaviour management” are still bandied around as if a child’s conduct is something to be negotiated. It smacks of compromise and containment. It undermines authority.’
