The U.S. and China have agreed on a new draft sanctions resolution to punish North Korea for its latest nuclear test, U.N. diplomats said.

The U.N. Security Council announced yesterday that it will hold closed consultations on North Korea and non-proliferation Tuesday morning.

The United States is expected to circulate a draft resolution to the full council at this morning's meeting, diplomats said, after which council members are expected to send the draft to their capitals for review.

All 15 council members approved a 
press statement condemning Pyongyang's nuclear test and pledging further
action hours after North Korea carried out its third atomic blast last month.

The swift and unanimous response from 
the U.N.'s most powerful body set the stage for a fourth round of 
sanctions against Pyongyang.

For the last three weeks, the United 
States, a close ally of South Korea and Japan, has been negotiating the 
text of a new resolution with China, the closest ally of North Korea.

Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly 
Churkin, told a 
news conference Monday that a resolution on North Korea might be 
approved in March though the text had not yet been circulated.

Last month's statement from the 
Security Council called the underground test in February a ‘grave 
violation’ of three U.N. resolutions that ban North Korea from 
conducting nuclear or missile tests.

At the time of the successful nuclear 
test in February, outgoing US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said North 
Korea represented a ‘serious threat’, adding: ‘We’ve got to be prepared
to deal with that.’

Even close ally China was openly 
critical, while President Barack Obama said the ‘highly provocative act’
threatened international peace.

‘The danger posed by North Korea’s threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community,’ Mr Obama said in a February statement.

On February 12, North Korea announced that
in open defiance of the United Nations it had conducted a successful 
underground test at the Punggye-ri nuclear site in the north-west of the
country.

Pyongyang made clear that the explosion of the device on February 12 was a warning to the U.S.

‘The
test was conducted in a safe and perfect way on a high level, with the 
use of a smaller and light A-bomb, unlike the previous ones,’ North 
Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said.

‘If
the US further complicates the situation with continued hostility, we 
will be left with no choice but to take even stronger second or third 
rounds of action.’

The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions after the first two nuclear tests and after the North's rocket launch in December, which was viewed as part of the country's covert program to develop ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear warheads.

The sanctions are aimed at trying to derail the country's rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, barring North Korea from testing or using nuclear or ballistic missile technology, and from importing or exporting material for these programs.

The latest sanctions resolution, adopted in January, again demanded that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program and cease missile launches.

It slapped sanctions on North Korean companies and government agencies, including its space agency and several individuals.

The diplomats said they did not know what new sanctions would be included in the resolution to be circulated Tuesday.

There has been speculation that a new resolution will strengthen existing sanctions related to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, toughen financial restrictions and cargo inspections, and add additional companies and individuals to the sanctions list.
