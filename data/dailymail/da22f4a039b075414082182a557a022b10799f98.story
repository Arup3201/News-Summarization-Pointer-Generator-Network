Britain's mini 'hurricane' has seen women across the country flood to the High Street in desperate search of a weatherproof coat.

With temperatures still in the late teens their over garment of choice, according to latest figures, is a trusty rainproof Mackintosh style.

The Saturdays' Vanessa White and stunning actress Jessica Chastain stepped out in a macs this week joining Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss, Alexa Chung and Mariah Carey, who were all recently pictured in a variety of trench coats.

New styles seen on the High Street hope to introduce a whole new generation of fashion followers to its charms. 

They include brightly coloured coats and even faux fur trims, which give a sprinkling of somethinmg extra to the faithful mac.

Sales of that great British standby - in all its many forms - have shot up by 108 per cent at Debenhams compared to this time last year.

The driest and fourth warmest September since 1910 is a distant memory as unsettled October continues to bring more heavy rain and cooler temperatures.

For many of us the perfect coat is a classic Burberry trench. But with a hefty price tag of more than £1,000 owning one is just a distant dream.

So to get you ready to brave the weather in style, Femail selects the coolest mac and trench coats from the High Street for all budgets. Just bring a brolly with you.

Debenhams spokesperson Elena Antoniou said: 'The great thing about the mac is that it is so versatile, it can be smart and even formal over an evening dress on a wet and windy evening, as well as being incredibly practical. Yet it can also be thrown over a casual top and pair of jeans for an effortlessly classic look.

'The new shorter, flared shapes are very flattering to most figures and the latest range of bright colours, including pillar-box reds and purples, are appealing to a whole new section of customers who maybe wouldn't have previously considered a mac.'

Scottish chemist Charles Mackintosh (1766-1843) is credited with inventing the Mackintosh raincoat, but the method of dissolving rubber and attaching it to fabric to make it waterproof was actually invented by the Scottish surgeon James Syme. Mackintosh, a contemporary of Syme, patented the idea in 1823 of cementing two pieces of fabric together with rubber to create a waterproof material, and went into the production of raincoats.

The first was sold in 1824 and production of rubberised coats soon spread all over Britain. Every kind of coat was produced with rubberised material including riding coats and coats supplied to the British Army, British Railways and UK police forces. 

But the terms mackintosh and mac are now used to refer to any shower-proof or waterproof coat.
