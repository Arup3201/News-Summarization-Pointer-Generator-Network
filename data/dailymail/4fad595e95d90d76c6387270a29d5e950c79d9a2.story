The pit bull that was shot in the head by a New York City police officer on a crowded street two weeks ago is making swift recovery, according to officials.  

The dog named Star was gunned down in the East Village after it lunged at police officers trying to approach the animal’s homeless owner, Lech Stankiewicz, who was apparently having a seizure.

The wounded pup was taken to the Manhattan Care Center, where it has been receiving veterinary care since the August 13 incident.

Road to recovery: Star the pit bull pictured napping while recovering from a gunshot wound to the head it suffered after lunging at an NYPD officer

According to a New York City Animal Care and Control spokesman, Good Samaritans donated money through the Special Treatment and Recovery Fund (STAR)  set up for the dog to cover its medical expenses, which so far have reached nearly $10,000.

The
spokesperson said that most of the dog’s injuries were contained inside its 
mouth. Star is expected to undergo surgery this week, and it is likely 
that doctors will have to remove one of the pup’s eyes.

Since the dog’s owner had failed to reclaim Star by the 8pm deadline last Friday, ACC was given legal ownership of the pooch.

Once
Star is released from the animal hospital, the ACC expects to hand over
the pit bull to the Mayor’s Alliance for NYC’s Animals.

Bad news: Officials said the pooch is expected to undergo a surgery and will likely lose an eye due to its injury

The New York Daily News reported that it was not Star’s first encounter with police.

On
June 19, the dog attacked a 22-year-old woman as she tried to intervene
when Star lunged at a police officer at Second Avenue and East 15th 
Street. The woman was treated for bite wounds to her arms and chest.

The incident that landed Star in the animal clinic this time took place on August 13 at East 14th Street near Second Avenue.

In a video released by Gothamist, an officer could be seen firing at the dog in broad daylight in front of dozens of screaming bystanders.

officers approached the dog's owner while he was lying unconscious on 
the street before Star snapped at a bystander's leg.

Star
quickly reverses direction and lunges toward the police officer, who 
shoots it twice before the animal comes to a halt, twitching on the 
street in agony.

'[The police] were telling people standing around to get back, but a lady was standing behind the passed out-guy got a little too close, so the dog nips at her,' a witness told Gothamist.

Johnny Rodriguez told the website that he and three others told the police that there was a passed out man lying in the street.

Attack: Angered and confused by the encroaching strangers, the dog first went for a bystander, nipping at a woman's leg

Fright: That's when the officer pulled out his weapon and aimed it at Star, who came rushing at him

They saw him having a seizure, lying  down on the ground twitching and shaking.

Mr Rodriguez said the two officers called for backup and started to get too close to the man for the dog's comfort.

'I told one of the cops, "Hey, that dog is growling, be careful," but it was too late.

Angered and confused by the encroaching strangers, the dog first went for a bystander, nipping at a woman's leg.

That's when the officer pulled out his weapon and aimed it at Star, who came rushing at him.

He fired his gun twice at the animal, causing it to tumble and then slide across the street before it came to a whimpering halt.

It flailed on the ground for a few moments, before it stopped.

'How could you do that??! How could you do that ??!' one bystander screamed.

While some witnesses said that the officer was only defending himself, others accused the officer of using excessive force.

Investigation: An investigator closes off a portion of the sidewalk where the dog was shot

Aida Feliciano, who lives nearby, told the New York Daily News that the dog's homeless owner was kicked by officers, prompting the dog to become defensive of its owner.

She said: 'Instead of calling the ambulance, they started kicking him.'

Another witness told NY1: 'I talked to the cop afterwards. He was very shaken up. He's a dog lover and it ruined his week, if not his year. And he did what he had to do to protect himself.'

Investigation: The busy street corner was blocked off by police tape following the shooting
