Leighton Baines gave Kevin Mirallas a couple of hefty slaps to the head as he refused to hand over the ball – appearing less like encouragement for the impending penalty kick and more like, 'What the hell are you doing?'

That was exactly what Everton manager Roberto Martinez was thinking on the touchline as his winger, who had never taken a Premier League spot-kick, refused to hand the ball over to Baines who has scored 15 of the 16 he's struck.

Afterwards, Martinez claimed he hooked Mirallas at half-time of the goalless draw with West Bromwich Albion due to a hamstring injury on Monday evening.

It wasn't the first and certainly won't be the last of the penalty rows and here, Sportsmail takes a look back at some of the others.

THOSE WHO MISSED...

Pajtim Kasami

Fulham v Chelsea, September 2011

Martin Jol ended up fining himself after a row over penalties. On the pitch, 19-year-old Pajtim Kasami had angered the then-Fulham manager by refusing to let designated penalty taker Orlando Sa take a spot-kick in normal time of their Carling Cup tie with Chelsea. Kasami was fined £500 by Jol after the game went to extra-time and they lost on penalties. But the Dutchman later fined himself. While Jol had told Sa he was on spot-kick duty, he had failed to inform the rest of the team and his actions angered senior players.

Daniel Sturridge

Liverpool v Everton, January 2014

Less of a row between the takers, this one. Steven Gerrard had handed over his penalty-taking duties to Daniel Sturridge who had already scored two sublime strikes past bitter Merseyside rivals Everton.

Unfortunately for the England striker he blazed his effort over the bar. He was then substituted by boss Brendan Rodgers where a row ensued on the touchline.

Sturridge was forced to say sorry, afterwards. 

'I want to apologise for my reaction,' he said. 'It was just disappointment after missing the penalty, but I let myself down and the fans. I apologise if it caused anyone any offence.'

Gerrrard added: 'I told him to take the penalty, so I have to hold my hands up and take the blame for that.'

Alexis Sanchez

Arsenal v QPR, December 2014

Arsenal's golden boy turned a slight shade of red on Boxing Day. Santi Cazorla had already scored two penalties against Stoke and Newcastle in December, but while the nation were tucking into their Christmas dinner leftovers Sanchez insisted on taking one when he went down in the box against QPR. Cazorla made way, but Sanchez struck a weak penalty which was easily saved by Rob Green. He did, however, make up for it by scoring the first and setting up the second in a 2-1 win.

Dani Osvaldo

Sampdoria v Roma, February 2013

Never far from controversy, Dani Osvaldo overruled legendary penalty taker Francesco Totti while he was at Roma. Osvaldo then proceeded to hit a tame effort into the arms of the Sampdoria goalkeeper and Roma lost 3-1. Osvaldo apologised on Twitter afterwards. Six months later he was sold on to Southampton, where it was made very clear that Rickie Lambert – who scored all 34 of the penalties he took for the south coast club – would be taking them.

Marcello Trotta

Brentford v Doncaster, April 2013

Marcello Trotta had only come on in the 77th minute when, on loan at Brentford from Fulham, he demanded to take a stoppage-time penalty against Doncaster in a battle at the top of League One. Had they scored, Brentford could've gone on to win promotion. With that glory in mind Trotta wrestled the ball from regular taker Kevin O'Connor, but hit the crossbar with his effort. Doncaster then broke up the other end and scored to win promotion. Remarkably, Brentford took him on loan for another season the following campaign. 'I can't change what happened in the past,' Trotta said afterwards.

Paul Kitson

West Ham v Everton, April 1997

An incident where an act of generosity left two strikers red-faced and a manager fuming. West Ham were 2-0 ahead against Everton through Paul Kitson's double. They won a penalty to secure the victory and in the absence of the injured Julian Dicks, spot-kick duties fell to John Hartson. But he selflessly handed the ball to Kitson to complete his hat-trick, only for Neville Southall to save and Everton to come back to draw 2-2, leaving West Ham manager Harry Redknapp furious.

THOSE WHO SCORED...

Xabi Alonso

Real Madrid v Villarreal, February 2010

Xabi Alonso was yet to score for Real Madrid following his £30million switch from Liverpool, but spotted the perfect opportunity with the team 5-2 ahead against Villarreal and a penalty won with three minutes to play.

Cristiano Ronaldo, already with a goal in the game, had other ideas, picked the ball up and strode to the spot. Alonso begged and pleaded with Real's star man to let him take it and Ronaldo eventually relinquished the ball. Real fans were calling for Raul to take it but Alonso stepped up to slot the ball in. Most of the players laughed and celebrated with Alonso. Ronaldo wouldn't look at him.

Paolo Di Canio

West Ham v Bradford, February 2000

West Ham were losing 4-2 to Bradford, then in the top flight, when an almighty argument broke out between Paolo Di Canio and Frank Lampard when a spot-kick was awarded. Lampard, the penalty taker, placed the ball and was ready to take it. Di Canio then repositioned it himself and scored the spot-kick. The pair continued arguing back to the halfway line. Joe Cole then equalised and, in his frustration, Lampard netted a late winner.

THE PENALTY TAKERS WHO STOOD FIRM...

Frank Lampard

Chelsea Wigan, May 2010

Chelsea were a goal ahead against Wigan knowing a win would secure them the Premier League title on the last day of the season when they won a first-half penalty. With the game still in the balance, Frank Lampard stuck to his principles and stood firm as top-scorer Didier Drogba tried to steal the ball off him to make sure he finished the campaign with the Golden Boot.

Lampard swept in the spot kick and Chelsea proceeded to hit eight past their opponents. Drogba ended up netting a 17-minute hat-trick including a penalty, this time Lampard standing aside with the team already having five, as they sealed the title.

Jonathan De Guzman

Swansea v Bradford, February 2013

Nathan Dyer became possibly the only person to win a cup final at Wembley, trouncing the opposition 5-0, and still sulk at the final whistle. The Swansea attacking midfielder was on a hat-trick with his side already three goals in front when they won a penalty in the 59th minute.

A blazing row ensued between Dyer and penalty taker Jonathan De Guzman who refused to give his team-mate all the glory. De Guzman scored and Swansea won the League Cup emphatically, securing their first major trophy in 101 years. Dyer was noticeably subdued in the celebrations.
