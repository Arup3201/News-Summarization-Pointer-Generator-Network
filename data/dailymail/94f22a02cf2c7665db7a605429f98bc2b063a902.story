Paedophile Stuart Hall threw his wedding ring into a prison pond after arguing with his wife on the telephone, it was claimed yesterday.

And to make matters worse, after the 84-year-old had calmed down he then allegedly asked the prison's governor if the water could be dredged so he could retrieve the gold band.

But his request was reportedly turned down. The claims were made by a former inmate of I Wing at HMP Wymott in Lancashire, where Hall is serving a five-year sentence for sex attacks on girls.

The unnamed sex offender told the Manchester Evening News that former It's A Knockout presenter Hall threw a ‘paddy’, which was witnessed by fellow inmates.

He said: ‘He had an argument with his wife on the phone. He took the ring off and threw it in the pond in a paddy. Everyone else thought it was hilarious but he was furious. He was slagging her off.’

The inmate added that it was not clear whether Hall had wanted the ring back because of a reconciliation with his 75-year-old wife Hazel, or simply because it was valuable.

Mrs Hall still lives in the couple's £2million mansion in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and vowed to stand by her husband earlier this year amid rumours she was planning a divorce.

Father-of-two Hall was jailed for 30 months last year after he pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 13 girls, aged between nine and 17, over a 20-year period.

The inmate said that Hall (above) was an unpopular figure inside the prison and could be 'quite arrogant'

He was sentenced to another two and a half years in prison in May for indecently assaulting an underage girl but was cleared of 15 counts of rape involving two women.

Hall will not be eligible for release from prison until December 2015 because the two sentences will run consecutively.

The inmate repeated claims that Hall had received preferential treatment at the jail, which houses 1,200 inmates on four wings, many of them sex offenders.

He said Hall remained ‘blasé’ about his crimes, telling fellow inmates he was innocent and that he was ‘put in here for patting someone on the bum - it's ridiculous’.

The inmate said that Hall was an unpopular figure inside the prison and could be ‘quite arrogant’. It was ‘common knowledge’ Hall was writing his autobiography while inside, he added.

The Sunday Mirror reported in May that Hall had secured a cleaning job at the jail - prompting fellow inmates to shout ‘It's a muck-out’ as he does his rounds.

The Prison Service has previously denied claims from another former inmate that Hall was receiving preferential treatment because he was a celebrity.
