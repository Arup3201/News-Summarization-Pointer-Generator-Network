A retired businessman who once enjoyed all the perks that came with his six figure salary job is being forced to make ends meet in his retirement by working two lowly paid part-time jobs.

Former high flying marketing executive Tom Palome, 77, now fills his days making $10 an hour to demonstrate food at Sam's Club and $8 an hour flipping burgers and serving drinks at a golf club in Tampa, Florida.

‘I earn in a week what I used to earn in an hour,’ Palome, who used to fly first class on business trips to Europe, told Bloomberg.

While Palome worked hard his entire career, paid off his mortgage and put his kids through college, like most Americans he didn’t save enough for retirement.

In addition, his savings more than halved to $40,000 after the financial crisis struck in 2008.

In need of cash to maintain his lifestyle and with years if not decades of life ahead of him, Palome took the first job he could find – not easy to find for someone at his stage in life.

Palome’s reduced circumstances are part of a much the larger trend in America in which workers from all wage brackets are being forced to stay on in the workforce as they both live longer and have fewer retirement savings to rely on. 

Palome says he isn't bitter about his reduced circumstances and is grateful for his health and that he can work

At the Rogers Golf Club in Tampa, Palome is constantly on his feet manning the takeout counter, cash register and grill - all for $8 an hour plus tips

Last year 7.2 million Americans aged 65 and older were employed - a 67 percent increase on a decade ago

Even many affluent baby boomers who are approaching the end of their careers haven’t come close to saving the 10 to 20 times their annual working income that investment experts say they’ll need to maintain their standard of living in old age.

The situation is also getting worse. The baby boomer generation, who began turning 65 in 2011 and are reaching that age at a rate of about 8,000 a day, are the first generation expected to fund their own retirements, even as they live longer lives.

Company-paid pensions are mostly a thing of the past now, replaced in the last three decades by 401(k) accounts primarily funded and managed by employees.

The median 401(k) balance for households headed by people aged 55 to 64 who had retirement accounts at work was $120,000 in 2011, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.

‘The current retirement savings systems isn’t working, and that’s becoming a crisis as Americans who make it to 65 in good health are now living at least two more decades,’ said Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager.

In the 1970s, Palome was a vice president of marketing for the pharmaceutical company, The Cooper Companies, he helped secure an endorsement for the Oral-B toothbrush from the U.S. Olympic Committee.

Palome says he knows many retirees who stay home doing nothing because they refuse to take jobs they feel are beneath them

Now he's expected to sell at least two 
boxes of crackers during his seven-hour shift at Sam’s Club. At the 
Rogers Golf Club in Tampa, he’s constantly on his feet manning the 
takeout counter, cash register and grill.

Rather than focus about what he used to have, Palome prefers to be optimistic about his situation. He is in good health, lives independently and he in gainful employment.

‘I tell people I demonstrate food and I do short-order cooking. I don't mind saying it. What's important is that I can work today,’ he told Bloomberg.

Palome receives $1,200 from Social Security and a $600 a month pension from his last corporate job. Still, his $1,400 in monthly wages allows him to bolster his savings and provides for some extras.

He goes to the theater, pays for plane tickets to visit his children and grandsons and takes occasional vacations. 

Two years ago Palome met Maxine Haynes, left, from the AARP Senior Community Service Employment Program who helped him find work

‘I know seniors like me who hardly ever leave their homes because they don’t have money to do anything,’ Palome said. ‘They could work, but won’t take a lesser job.’

Two years ago, Palome saw an advertisement in a local paper for the AARP Senior Community Service Employment Program. He met with Maxine Haynes, the program’s Tampa project director, who helped him get an interview at Advantage Sales & Marketing LLC, which runs food demonstrations for Sam’s Club and other stores.

To stretch his income, Palome runs his dishwasher once a week and turns off his hot water heater every morning after he showers. He buys airline tickets six months in advance, booking rental cars for as little as $13.80 a day.

If Palome has one regret, it’s that he didn’t get better retirement investing advice somewhere along the line. “I thought I could do it on my own,' he said.
