This is the moment a reckless swimmer was caught on camera walking into 15ft waves for fun on the same day St Judes's storm hit Britain.

The man was spotted in the sea as the towering waves lashed the shoreline at Porthleven in Cornwall on Monday to the 
astonishment of crowds who had gathered to watch the extreme weather.

The thrill-seeking swimmer was seen walking into the waves with his arms outstretched, and even lay down in the swell to float on his back.

The stunt was later branded 'extremely dangerous' by lifeguards, and came just 24 hours after 14-year-old Dylan Alkins was swept to his death by a giant wave in Newhaven, East Sussex.

'Idiot': The man is seen with his arms outstretched walking towards stormy seas at Porthleven, Cornwall

'Chances of survival are slim': An RNLI official said that if the man was caught up in the current he would probably have died

The man was caught on 
camera by photographer Keith Richards, who was taking pictures of the 
raging sea at around 9am.

He said: 'I couldn’t believe it. My first reaction was, ‘What an idiot’. He could easily have got into trouble.

'It was an incredibly stupid thing to do. Other people said exactly the same to me.'

Although the man had a
lucky escape, his 'incredibly stupid' actions have outraged the 
lifeguards who would have had to save him if he got into trouble.

James Millidge, an incident reduction with the RNLI, said the swimmer was lucky to get out of the sea alive.

He said there was the risk of drowning, dying from cold water shock or from being battered on to rocks by the crashing waves.

Drifting to disaster: Astonishingly, the man lay back and floated in the waters, before heading back to shore

Reckless: The man stands in front of the receding waves, surrounded by rocks

Mr Millidge said: 'Taking to the sea in such challenging conditions and with inappropriate clothing is not only foolish but extremely dangerous for you and for those RNLI volunteers who may have to come and rescue you if the sea washes you away.

'The sea is far more powerful than you think and your chances of survival are slim if you are dragged away by the swell.

'We understand why people want to experience extreme weather, but we would urge folk to watch the conditions from a safe distance so we don’t have to put our charity’s volunteer lifeboat teams in danger, or those of our colleagues in other emergency services who may ultimately be called to try and rescue you.'

Danger: Tago Mcloed, a coastguard at nearby Falmouth, urged bathers to take care in all weather conditions

Tago Mcloed, a coastguard at nearby Falmouth, urged bathers to take care in all weather conditions, not just storms.

He said: 'Checking the tide and weather conditions should always be done and it is advisable to let someone know your intentions.

'In addition, and perhaps more importantly, people should be realistic about their abilities.

'While these pictures are dramatic, we don’t know anything about this man’s swimming ability.

'A poor swimmer in relatively calm sea conditions could be at just as much risk, perhaps even more, than this man at Porthleven.

'However, it would be reasonable to say that in such sea conditions watching from a safe place is probably a more sensible idea for all concerned.'

St Jude's storm claimed five lives in total and more than a quarter of a million people were left without power.
