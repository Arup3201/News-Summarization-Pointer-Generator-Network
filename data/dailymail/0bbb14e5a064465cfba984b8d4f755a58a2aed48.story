An amputee in Delaware has been arrested for allegedly stashing more than one ounce of cocaine  inside his prosthetic leg.

Marlow Holmes, 39, of Dover was stopped by police on Monday around 2:30pm after K-9 dogs sniffed out narcotics in the SUV he was riding in.

During a  search of the vehicle, officers said they discovered 28.7 grams of cocaine stuffed into the artificial limb Holmes was wearing.

Following the discovery, he was jailed with a bond set at $81,000.

Holmes faces charges of possession with intent to deliver cocaine.

He has also been cited for possession of drug paraphernalia.

These allegations carry a minimum of two years in jail and a $50,000 fine.

Police say they kept the drugs as evidence but returned Holmes' leg.

It is unclear what happened to the driver of the car Holmes was riding in. 

Holmes is currently at Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna awaiting a hearing.
