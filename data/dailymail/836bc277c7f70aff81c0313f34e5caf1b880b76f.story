Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green has put struggling high street store BHS up for sale after a sales dip and pre-tax loss of £69.9million.

The billionaire businessman's decision to put the retail chain, with more than 185 stores, up for auction, signals the break-up of one of Britain's best-known high street empires.

It comes after the 62-year-old received several serious approaches in the past few months, senior city sources told the Sunday Times.

BHS has been a central part of Sir Philip's empire, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge and Wallis, since he bought the chain for £200million in 2000.

Sales at BHS dipped 3.5 per cent to £675.7million in 2013 and it made a pre-tax loss of £69.6million, according to accounts at Companies House.

Sir Philip brushed off a fall in annual profits at his retail empire in November last year, saying he could be 'a buyer or a seller' of high street chains due to the strength of his group's balance sheet.

Pre-tax profits for Taveta Investments, the group which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Burton and BHS, fell 3.4 per cent to £189.3m in the year to 30 August 2014.

Despite a near 1 per cent rise in sales to £2.7billion Bhs slid further into the red. The group also did not pay out a dividend for the ninth year in a row.

Sir Philip has rejected previous offers for BHS on price grounds. But, for the first time he is understood to have received a handful of bids that match his expectations.

The chain has attracted interest from rivals such as Primark, and late in 2013 it was briefly targeted by the South African billionaire Christo Wiese.

American hedge fund Apollo and the turnaround firm Hilco, which took over HMV, are also believed to have looked at it. 

BHS has 150 stores with permission to sell food and one approach is believed to have come from a grocery retailer.

Sir Philip bought BHS - then known as British Home Stores - in 2000 from the Storehouse conglomerate. 

The businessman made his first billion at the company by turning around the chain, a process he described as 'torture'. 

He later bought Arcadia, amassing more than 2,000 shops nationwide, and famously paid his wife a £1.2bn dividend in 2005.

Sir Philip has increasingly focused on Topshop, which he has taken to America and Asia after selling a minority stake to the private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners two years ago.

In 2014 three new standalone Topshop stores opened in the US, including a new flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. 

Topshop now has seven wholly-owned stores in the US, as well as 52 concessions in Nordstrom department stores. 

Sir Philip was no available for a comment when contacted. 

Sir Philip's most ambitious move came in 2004, when he put together £10billion to take over M&S

Sir Philip Green was born on 15 March 1952 in Croydon, south London, the son of a successful Jewish property developer and retailer. 

He then went on to learn the raw facts of business as an apprentice in a shoe warehouse and at 23-years-old he set up his own business importing and selling jeans. 

The moment Sir Philip Green finally 'arrived' was when he bought British Home Stores chain for £200million in 2000 and rebranded it BHS.

Two years later he copied the same buyout model when he bought the giant retail empire Arcadia, which owns brands such as Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Topshop and Topman. 

Sir Philip's most ambitious move came in 2004, when he put together £10billion, much of it from investment banks, to take over Marks and Spencer.

He has also forged a business partnership with supermodel Kate Moss, whose line of clothes helped raise Topshop's profile in the world of high fashion. 

The businessman commutes into London from Monaco in a private jet and is famous for throwing extravagant parties for friends including Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, and George Michael.
