Aaron Ramsey will undergo medical tests at Arsenal on Wednesday afternoon after sustaining an ankle injury playing for Wales against Andorra on Tuesday.

The Gunners midfielder will return to the club's London Colney HQ  following the international break and will immediately undergo a scan  to determine the extent of the injury.

Ramsey is touch and go to make a return for Arsenal's showdown with Manchester City on Saturday, but the club do not fear it is a serious injury.

The midfielder was the victim of some roughhouse treatment and rolled his ankle after receiving a kick.

Ramsey was replaced by Emyr Huws in added time and was seen limping away from Andorra’s Estadi Nacional.

‘He got kick on his ankle and twisted it,’ Wales manager Chris Coleman said. ‘Coming to the end of the game, we've got players with experience so it was pointless taking the risk. I won't do that with any of the players.

‘Hopefully he'll be okay for Arsenal at the weekend but we'll have to see what the next 24-48 hours holds.

'There were half a dozen challenges that weren't very good. The ref should have clamped down but he let it go and we are a bit disappointed with that - we had a bit to contend with tonight.'
