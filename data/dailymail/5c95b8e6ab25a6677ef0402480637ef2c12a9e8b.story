The similarities are uncanny – from the outlandish fascinators, to the plummy voices and voluptuous curves.

New drama The Royals, which launched in America last week, is about a ‘spoof’ British Royal Family – but two red-haired sisters, Penelope and Maribel, bear uncomfortable resemblances to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

The creators of the show, which stars Elizabeth Hurley as a couture-clad Queen, insist all the characters are ‘purely fictional’.

The real deal: 'The make-up girls and wardrobe ladies had photos of Beatrice and Eugenie pinned up everywhere,' said Hatty Preston, who plays Maribel

Many of the young Royals are shown engaging in wild, drug-fuelled orgies. 

Hatty Preston, who plays ‘dim-witted’ Maribel, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s inevitable that people will compare the sisters to Beatrice and Eugenie.

‘I based Maribel on the Made In Chelsea stars, but the make-up girls and wardrobe ladies had photos of Beatrice and Eugenie pinned up everywhere. It’s a spoof. I hope they realise we’re laughing with them, not at them.’

The Royals has already been panned by US critics. The first episode will be screened in the UK on E! on Wednesday.
