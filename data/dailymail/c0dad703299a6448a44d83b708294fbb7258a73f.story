 A £15 million wooden chemistry laboratory will continue to burn for a further 24 hours, firefighters confirmed today. 

The Carbon Neutral Laboratory for Sustainable Chemistry at Nottingham University was destroyed after it several fires broke out inside the state-of-the-art building on Friday night. 

The laboratory, which was part-funded by a £12 million grant from pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline was due to open for the first time next year.

The University of Nottingham's Carbon Neutral Laboratory for Sustainable Chemistry was completely destroyed by last night's blaze and continued to smolder today

The £15 million laboratory was constructed from environmentally sustainable materials such as wood in order to make it carbon neutral over the building's lifetime

Lighting up the sky: Some 60 firefighters were last night battling an ‘explosive’ blaze at a new £15million laboratory at Nottingham University

Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service were called to the scene at 8.30pm after residents spotted the blaze. 

Joanne Wooler-Ward, who was the Incident Commander from NFRS, said: 'No other buildings have been affected, fortunately no people were involved in this fire and we've had 12 crews here, that's over 60 firefighters.

'Credit to those firefighters who pulled out all the stops to prevent this fire spreading.

'When we arrived, the fire was a significant size - it could be seen from quite a distance - and there was a smoke plume spreading towards the campus area so we sent out a message for people to keep doors and windows closed.

'The firefighters have worked hard to contain that fire and stop it from spreading to any other buildings.

'Members of the public might have been quite alarmed when they heard a loud bang that some thought was an explosion - that's something that happens to buildings when they're exposed to extreme heat and pressure but that's a risk that we manage and are trained to deal with.' 

Fire officers remained on the scene today to continue spraying water at that the remains of the building which was completely destroyed by last night's fire 

Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service deployed 60 firefighters from 8.30pm last night to battle the blaze and stop it from spreading to adjacent buildings 

University of Nottingham Registrar Dr Paul Greatrix admitted the fire was a massive setback but said the college would rebuild the chemistry laboratory 

Eyewitnesses reported seeing the bright orange flames from as far as seven miles away.

Student Pollyanna Ward said: 'It just looked like a really bright light was coming from the building, then the building burst into flames.'

Claire Chubb, 19, added: 'We rushed back to see how bad it was. We could just see it glowing in the sky.'

And Joe Jones, a 33-year-old PhD student at the university, said: 'I thought my friend was joking when he told me how big the fire was.

'I know people who are due to move into that building when it opens. It will be a major setback for them and the university as a whole.'

Dr Paul Greatrix, registrar at the university, said: 'We are incredibly grateful to our staff and students for their fantastic response in dealing with this major incident and would like to express our gratitude to Nottinghamshire Fire Service.

'It was the quick action of their fire crews which prevented this incident from being much more serious. We have also been extremely touched by the messages and best wishes from our close neighbours out in the community.

'We would like to thank the wider higher education community across the UK for its support - we have had many offers of help from other universities around the country, for which we are extremely grateful.

'To put this loss into perspective, we need to remember that this was one building, that thankfully no one was injured and that the fire was prevented from spreading further on to campus.' 

Battle: Some 60 firefighters were at the university site, which had been due to open next month. Onlookers reported hearing the sound of several explosions

Inferno: The huge fire - which has devastated the building - could be seen for several miles around. Thousands study on the Jubilee Campus each day

The building was designed to reach carbon neutral status in 25 years to make up the energy expended during its construction.  

Mr Greatrix added: 'This is a setback for us but one from which we have no doubt we will recover.

'The GlaxoSmithKline Carbon Neutral Laboratory for Sustainable Chemistry is a landmark building which is the embodiment of the University's commitment to sustainability in all its forms, particularly in the area of green chemistry and we will be working closely with our partners at GSK, and the contractors Morgan Sindall, to develop a positive plan of action for rebuilding.'  

Crews from Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, Nottinghamshire Police and East Midlands Ambulance Service were also at the scene to ensure the public's safety.

It is not yet known what caused the blaze and a spokesperson for NFRS said work to establish the cause of the blaze can only begin fully once the fire is entirely out. 

Newark fire station manager Seth Armstrong, who took over as the incident commander said firefighters were still 'going in aggressively'.

He said: 'It's a very serious incident. I got here about 3am. The first responsibility was to check all the peripheral buildings.

'We're now at the stage where we're can go in there and help with the situation.

'Because it's a timber base, four or five secondary fires were around the scene. There were 12 fire engines and an average of five firefighters per engine.

'We're now trying to ramp it up and going in aggressively and get into the fire site. It will be at least 24 or 26 hours before we can make that massive difference.

'The investigation will follow. It's not safe enough to go in there yet.

'There are lots of pits, shafts and ladders that make it unsafe to go on the site.' 

After watching the fire rip through the building, student Pollyanna Ward said: ‘It just looked like a really bright light, then the building burst into flames'

After more than a 40 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, a fire service spokesman said: 'We were called at 8.36pm to a building under construction'.

Charred remains: The skeletal frame of the £15million building - which was due to be opened next month - appeared to be all that remained after the fire

Mr Armstrong confirmed the cause of the blaze was still unknown.

The University of Nottingham continued with their open day as planned today with staff saying it was 'business as usual'.

Senior security officer at the university, Steve Garrod, said: 'I got called back again to work prior to 9pm. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

'The firefighters are just dampening down. It's business as usual. The open day is still going ahead and so is the badminton competition.

'We are going to conduct an investigation into the building opposite.

'Once it was opened, running it was going to cost nothing to run because it's made out of sustainable sources.

'We are trying to open the surrounding businesses as well.' 

A spokesman for Morgan Sindall, the main contractors for the building, added: 'Everyone on the project team has been working hard to deliver this state-of-the-art low carbon laboratory for the university and we are of course greatly saddened to see the devastation caused by the fire.

'We are supporting the fire service investigation into the cause of the incident and thank its officers for their efforts last night to tackle and contain the blaze.'

Residents living near the university campus have also reacted in shock after flames ripped through the new science building.

Carolyn Wilkinson, 41, who could see the drama unfolding from her home, said: 'It was at about quarter to ten I was first alerted to it.

'I had a loft conversion and looked out the sky light. At first I thought my neighbour had a log fire. There were massive bangs.

'We went to bed about quarter past midnight. It was still ablaze but the roof had gone. The building had disappeared.

'It was horrible and it's very sad. I hope it wasn't deliberate.'

Jean Dunhan, 69, and David Fallows, 69, who live together in nearby Radford, Nottinghamshire, also witnessed the blaze.

Mrs Dunhan said: 'My son phoned me yesterday evening to say he had seen it on the internet. I didn't know anything before that.

'We walk around here regularly and we've seen the building being built.'

Mr Fallows added: 'I looked out of the back garden window looking out onto the university. I could see flames and sparks. It was just like fireworks going off.

'We went outside out at about 10pm to The Plough pub which is even closer.

'I can't believe what was there before and what is there now. All the workers, all those jobs and money - it's a shame.'
