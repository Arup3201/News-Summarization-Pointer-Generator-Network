A woman who had a five-month-old baby die in her care has given a tearful apology to the girl's parents in a Brisbane courtroom.

Emma Hicks dropped off her daughter Indianna at the home of Tracey Cross, who provided services for the Sunshine Coast Family Day Care Scheme, on the morning of July 20, 2012.

That afternoon, Ms Cross checked on Indianna to find her laying face down, limp and pale.

Attempts to revive her on the kitchen floor were unsuccessful and she was pronounced dead at Caloundra Hospital, a coronial inquest on Brisbane heard on Monday.

Ms Cross told the inquest she was not told until months later that Indianna had died of SIDS and thought she had been responsible.

'I thought I must have wrapped her wrong or suffocated her or something and I blamed myself for a very wrong time,' she said.

The home daycare operator said she went into shock immediately after the incident and did not know how to break the news to Ms Hicks when she arrived to pick up Indianna and her son Lachlan.

'I apologise to no end that we didn't get to Emma in time,' a sobbing Ms Cross said.

'But you've got to remember that ... by the time the ambulance took Indi ... I was beside myself.

'I knew Emma was going to turn up and I was worried about who was going to tell her. I knew I was in no position (to).'

Ms Hicks, who was sitting with her husband Derek, left the courtroom in tears as Ms Cross described the moment she realised Indianna was in trouble.

The grieving mother had told the court she was reluctant to leave Indianna with Ms Cross, given she had recently been to the doctor with a cold and still had a runny nose.

'I did question leaving her and she insisted that she would be fine,' Ms Hicks said.

Ms Hicks also said she was upset Ms Cross started caring for other children less than a week later, and that she had smelt cigarette smoke on Ms Cross and in her home, which she was also concerned about.

But in her evidence, Ms Cross rejected both points, saying she had never smoked and she returned to work only in a reduced capacity four weeks after the incident.

The two-day inquest will look at the circumstances before Indianna's death, best sleeping practices for children aged three to six months, and how similar deaths could be prevented.
