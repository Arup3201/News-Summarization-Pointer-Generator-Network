Romance: The Apprentice candidates James Hill and Lauren Riley had a fling during the competition

'They had a fairly full-on fling. They were always sneaking off.'

Lauren and James kept their place in the competition during the latest episode, after Robert Goodwin and Scott McCulloch given the boot by Lord Sugar.

Last week, it was revealed that Hill, from Chesterfield, was given an 18-month suspended jail sentence after admitting two assault charges at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court.

He beat up a bus driver who was talking to his girlfriend, hitting him with 'punch after punch' in an unprovoked attack that left the victim scarred for life. Months later, he was involved in another brawl in which he bit a man's ear.

Hill apologised after his first victim, who asked not to be named, told how the candidate attacked him after he chatted to his girlfriend in a bar owned by the entrepreneur's father.

The victim, who said he knew the young woman as she worked at a local soft play centre, told the Sun: 'Hill stormed over and began throwing his fists - he threw punch after punch.'

He said he fell to the floor and looked up, only to see a boot coming towards his face. Hill was dragged off by bouncers who told the victim he should call the police.

He said: 'He was always starting fights and they wanted someone to teach him a lesson.'

As Hill waited for his court case, he got into trouble again, this time biting a man's ear on Christmas Eve 2008.

After the second attack, Hill was arrested and appeared at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court on March 2 2009, where he was charged under his full name of Anthony James Hill and admitted two counts of assault.

In July that year he was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended, ordered to pay his victims £300 and £200 respectively, and told to pay £755 costs. Now Hill, who started out in business washing cars, uns several businesses including selling vending machines and running his own bar and restaurant.

A spokesman for The Apprentice told MailOnline: 'It is a spent conviction under the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and therefore James was eligible to apply for the programme.'

A spokesman for Hill said: 'James is not proud of what happened. He was young and irresponsible and very much regrets - and has learned from - his actions.' 

You're fired! No doubt Lord Sugar won't be happy to find out the candidates are getting frisky on his time

This is not the first time there has been a romance on the BBC One reality show.

Last year, Jordon Poulton claimed to have sex in cupboard with fellow contestant Luisa Zissman.   

In an interview with The Sun, the businessman said: 'When I was with Luisa I spent a lot of time in cupboards — literally. It wasn't easy to have sex in the Apprentice house as there were minders living there trying to stop us.

'Our routine was I'd go off somewhere and she'd disappear too, and we'd muck around until someone came to find us. When people try to stop you having sex, the tension ramps up more.'

Luisa Zissman, who was the runner up in last year's Apprentice allegedly had sex with fellow candidate Jordan Poulton in a cupboard 

In 2011, contestants Glenn Ward and Zoe Beresford reportedly starting dating after filming of the show ended. 

In 2007, candidate Kristina Grimes claimed a task had been ruined because of a relationship between Katie Hopkins and ex-Army lieutenant, Paul Callaghan.

Elsewhere, couple Kate Walsh and Phil Walsh, who met on the 2009 show, are still together.
