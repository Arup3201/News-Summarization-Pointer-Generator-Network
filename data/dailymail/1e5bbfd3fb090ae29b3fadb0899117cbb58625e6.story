Strolling hand in hand with his partner on a tropical beach, Chris Huhne takes a break from lecturing us on climate change.

The former Cabinet minister and Carina Trimingham jetted off on a 12,000-mile return flight to enjoy a carefree break on an exotic island.

Huhne, 59, a crusader for green taxes, flew almost half way round the world for the winter sun getaway with his 47-year-old girlfriend.

They enjoyed beach walks and dips in the azure waters of Phu Quoc, an idyllic Vietnamese island in the Gulf of Thailand.

It was a far cry from Leyhill Prison in Gloucestershire, where Huhne last year served 62 days of an eight-month sentence for his dishonesty in the speeding points affair.

When he was climate change secretary, Huhne called for a sharp increase in air taxes as part of efforts to persuade people to take fewer flights.

Carbon dioxide emissions from aeroplanes are blamed for contributing to global warming.

This is the same as the average carbon footprint for one Briton for a whole year – or 90 times that of one Ethiopian – and would need 24 trees to be planted to ‘offset’ it.

On Monday Huhne was back on the airwaves as part of his bid to stage a comeback to public life following the humiliating fall from grace that ended his political career.

On Radio 4’s Today programme, he warned listeners that threats from climate change remained ‘severe’ and he later appeared on Newsnight on BBC2.

However the threats are not ‘severe’ 
enough, it seems, to have put him off flying to the Far East and back 
for his holiday last month.

Huhne and Miss Trimingham spent their days lazing on sun-loungers on the beach and reading espionage novels.

The millionaire former MP stayed in a £28-a-night budget hotel – in one of the cheapest rooms available – in a coconut grove fringing the beach.

A fellow tourist said: ‘The resort is a stone’s throw from five-star beachfront hotels, but they were very happy in the sparse accommodation costing much less. They seemed very relaxed and happily mingled with other guests.’

Huhne was jailed for perverting the course of justice following months of lies in which he repeatedly denied the offence of making his wife take his speeding points in 2003 so that he could avoid a driving ban.

Huhne’s former wife Vicky Pryce was also jailed for the offence.

Warning: Chris Huhne has previously referred to climate change as 'a man-made disaster'

Chris Huhne has been more than happy to preach the climate change message over the years. Here are a few of his remarks:
