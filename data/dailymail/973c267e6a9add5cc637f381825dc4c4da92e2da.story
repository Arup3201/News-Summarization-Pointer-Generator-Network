Over a quarter of women adopt male characteristics in attempt to get ahead

Despite recent advancements in gender equality in the workplace, women are still lacking in self-confidence, not putting themselves forward for promotion, and perceive men to have numerous advantages over them, according to a new survey.

A quarter of women (26 per cent) even feel that adopting 
stereotypical male characteristics  could help them to 
get to the top of their field.

One in 
five women (20 per cent) believe gender discrimination at work has 
made it more difficult for them to reach their career goals.

And over a third (38 per cent) 
say lack of confidence in their own abilities and a reluctance to push for
 promotions (37 per cent) is making it harder for them to reach progress up ladder, according to a survey by Cancer Research UK. 

Lack of flexible working arrangements to allow for
 childcare is also seen to be a barrier by 27 per cent of women, as are
 the negative attitudes of employers and colleagues with regards to balancing work 
and family life (25 per cent).

Over half (55 per cent) 
say female colleagues without children are more likely to reach senior positions in 
the workplace, whileclose to half (44 per cent) think having children has
 held them back at work.

The
 majority of women said that flexible working (68 per cent), training 
(66 per cent) and financial support for childcare (61 per cent) would 
aid career progression.

And more than half (57 per cent) believe that expert mentoring would better equip them with the skills to reach their potential.

The survey of 2,000 women was carried out to launch Cancer Research UK's pioneering Women of Influence initiative. 

The scheme has established a unique network of senior businesswomen to support the charity's exceptional young female scientists and clinicians as they move up the career ladder to progress into senior positions.

A quarter feel employers and colleagues have a negative attitude towards balancing work and family

It aims to enable these talented women to reach their potential in becoming science leaders of the future, and raise Â£1 million to support their life-saving research to help beat cancer sooner.

'Confidence helps us reach higher in our careers,' said Tamara Box, Chairwoman of the Cancer Research UK Women of Influence board.

She continued: 'Cancer Research UK currently has many well-educated and capable female scientists who should be rising to the top of their professions.

'Our Women of Influence initiative hopes to provide business mentoring as well as financial support, in order that their work may be continued even while they have full, multifaceted lives. 

'They in turn will become role models and leaders for the next generation. I'm confident that Cancer Research UKâ€™s Women of Influence initiative will make a huge difference not only in the lives of the researchers but also in the fight against cancer.'

David Scott, Cancer Research UKâ€™s director of science funding said: 'The research we fund will save lives in the future so we need to fund the most talented male and female scientists at all career stages.

'We see a lack of female researchers moving to the highest levels and we want to address this by supporting our female scientists to achieve their potential, becoming future role models for younger scientists and ultimately helping us to beat cancer sooner.'
