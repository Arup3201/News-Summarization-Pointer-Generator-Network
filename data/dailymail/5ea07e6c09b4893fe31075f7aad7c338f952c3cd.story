Some prefer life in the fast lane and each year hot rodders from Australia and around the world congregate for some adrenalin pumping action.

Incredible images have emerged from Australia's version of Speed Week hosted at an extensive salt lake found in the outback of Australia.

The Dry Lakes Racers Australia is held annually at Lake Gairdner in central South Australia. It attracts motor enthusiasts and speed demons alike in March when the lake is dry.

Many of the vehicles are specifically designed and constructed for Land Speed Racing - one of the earliest and purest forms of motorsport.

The blindingly clean white backdrop of Australia's fourth largest salt lake compliments each image, illustrating different characters and high-powered vehicles at the event.

The first Speed Week in Australia was held back in 1990 and has been running ever since. This year it ran from February 28 to March 7.

It has attracted competitors from all over Australia, the US, New Zealand and the UK.
