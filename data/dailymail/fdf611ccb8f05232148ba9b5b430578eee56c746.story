Ryan Gauld is hoping to emulate his former Dundee United team-mate Andrew Robertson by training his way to a Scotland cap.

Gauld, along with Stevie May, are the only new faces in Gordon Strachan's squad for the European Championship qualifying double-header against Georgia and Poland.

The 18-year-old signed for Sporting Lisbon in the summer while ex-flatmate Robertson, 20, moved to Premier League side Hull City in a £2.85million move, thus completing his meteoric rise in the game.

Soon after moving from amateur outfit Queen's Park to United in the summer of 2013, Robertson was capped at Scotland under-21 level.

Strachan was so impressed when he occasionally borrowed him for training sessions with the senior team that he handed the left-back his debut as a substitute in the away friendly against Poland in March and he is now an established squad member.

Gauld has yet to make a start for his new club and has only recently forced his way in to the under-21 squad but Strachan's assistant, Mark McGhee, hinted that impressive performances in training this week could go a long way to boost his chances of a senior debut.

Speaking at the Scottish FA's Performance School Festival at Toryglen in Glasgow, the attacking midfielder said:

'It is huge encouragement. It showed with the likes of Andy Robertson, the first time he did really well in training.

'He managed to come off the bench against Poland to make his debut and he hasn't looked back since then.

'I think it shows that if you get off to the right start and make a positive contribution, it can only stand you in good stead.

Hull City's Andrew Robertson impressed Strachan after training with the senior Scotland side 

'It is great to play along top players (in training), it is a great opportunity to be able to do that.'

Gauld joked that Robertson has already pulled rank.

'He is telling me that he is one of the experienced heads now so I have to listen to him,' he said.

'Obviously he is great to have around, he is a great friend of mine so to have a well-known face around me is good.'

Scotland's second Group D fixture - they lost 2-1 away to Germany last month - is against the Georgians at Ibrox on Saturday, followed by a trip to Warsaw for the game against Poland the following Tuesday night.

Gauld believes he is ready to make the 'huge step' up to Strachan's side.

'I have had a good start to the season and I think I am ready to go in if called upon,' said the Scotland Under-21 player who claims his move to Portugal has allowed him to 'develop further my technical abilities and also my tactical side of the game'.

'We are spending the whole week preparing for a couple of big games and everyone has got to be ready in case they are called upon.

'It would the best thing to happen to me. As a young kid, everyone watches the Scotland games whenever they are on so to be involved would be out of this world.

'It is a huge step up, you can see that from the training but with a little time in the training and getting to know everybody that is only going to help me.

'The manager said he wanted to get to know me and not to be afraid to do everything I can, and enjoy myself.

'It has been a great experience for myself and Stevie, something that we will both remember and learn from as well.'
