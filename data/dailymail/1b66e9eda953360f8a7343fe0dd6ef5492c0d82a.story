A man who survived two days lost in freezing temperatures in the snowy Sierra Nevada mountain range region told rescue workers that he was desperately craving a hamburger.

Robert Root, 55, from Modesto in Northern California, was jogging as part of a large group on a trail near Foresthill on the Sierra Nevada's north west edge when he ran ahead and took a wrong turn.

After spending two days sleeping in bushes while wearing only a light jacket and running shorts in the sub-zero conditions, Mr Root said the only thing he could think about eating was an In-N-Out burger.

Saved: Robert Root was rescued after two days lost in the snowy Sierra Nevada mountain range. He told ambulance workers that he was craving an In-N-Out burger

Desperate: More than 60 people joined the search for Robert Root. He spent two nights sleeping in shrubbery to keep him warm in sub-zero conditions before being found

While being loaded into a waiting 
ambulance, Mr Root, who is known as Bob, said he was 'grateful' to be 
alive and thanked the rescuers who found him wandering on a bridge on the Western States trail yesterday afternoon.

Root was last seen on Sunday morning, shortly before 
he separated from fellow members of the ShadowChase Running Club.

The group were training for the annual Western States Endurance run that will be held in June, Placer County sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said.

'It's just amazing. He was found alive, alert and talking...Just amazing,' she added.

The
 Sunday morning runners had been split into fast and slow groups, with Root initially running with the slower members.

When his group briefly 
stopped, Root decided to run ahead and catch the faster team, but he 
took a wrong turn on the trail and disappeared from sight into the mountain range.

An extensive search began on the rugged terrain within hours, but it was suspended due to darkness and falling temperatures.

Root
 ended up on a cliff overlooking the American River, where he slept intermittently in shrubbery on Sunday evening - keeping his fingers warm by putting them under his armpits.

He also compressed and released 
his muscles over and over to stay warm.

The search restarted on Monday morning, with more than 60 people taking to the mountain range using motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, search dogs and helicopters to no avail.

Five members of the Tahoe Nordic Search Team even spent the whole of Monday 
night in the mountains after heavy snowfall forced the rest of the team to suspend their search.

Changeable weather: Although the Sierra Nevada mountain range is in sunny California, conditions often fall well below zero on the higher peaks

Root, meanwhile, found himself wandering around in circles, somehow always ending up on the same cliff top and gradually running out of the energy supplements and water he had been carrying.

Determined not to spend another night on the same cliff, Root took another root and eventually reached the El Dorado Bridge, where he saw people 
wearing bright-colored uniforms.

The people were, as Root had hoped, searching for him, and were amazed to find the under-dressed 55-year-old not only alive, but walking.

Covered in metallic blankets and other 
warm materials, a disheveled and red-faced Root smiled at TV reporters 
after authorities slowly brought him down in an all-terrain vehicle from
 the snowy trail in the Sierra Nevada, about 200 miles east of San 
Francisco.
