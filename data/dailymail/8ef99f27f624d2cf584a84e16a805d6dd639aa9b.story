Mick Jagger sang the Bob Dylan classic Just Like a Woman at a packed memorial service for L'Wren Scott which featured some of the world's biggest names in fashion and music.

Family, friends and fashion insiders gathered at the service at Manhattan's St Bart's Church last night for the fashion designer, who took her own life aged 49 in March.

Her inner circle began arriving in fleets of cars and limousines 45 minutes before the service started. Vanity Fair Editor Graydon Carter was among the first to arrive, followed by Vogue

outfits with one woman wearing silver platform shoes that were so high 
she had to be helped up the steps of the church by security guards.

Andre
 Leon Talley, a close friend of the late designer and a former 
editor-at-large at Vogue magazine, made a dramatic entrance in his

Afterwards, Andre Leon Talley described the Memorial Service as beautiful. 'Everyone spoke. Mick Jagger spoke, Sarah Jessica Parker spoke, Rachel Feinstein spoke and I spoke too,' he said.

'All the children and grandchildren read out poems and Scriptures. It was beautiful, solemn and elegant, it was L’Wren.'

He said the church was decorated with the designer’s favorite flowers including roses and cherry blossom.

Asked about Mick Jagger’s demeanor, Mr Talley said 'Mick was joyous. It was a celebration. He loved his L’Wren.'

Other mourners leaving the church variously described the service as 'sad,' 'beautiful' and 'dignified.'
