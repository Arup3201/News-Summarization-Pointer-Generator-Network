Whisky drink advert starring David Beckham is cleared of encouraging underage drinking after the star agreed to front the stylish TV advertising campaign.

Campaigners at Alcohol Concern argued that the former footballer in the Haig Club Whisky advert would appeal to youngsters and make drinking alcohol appear essential to social success.

They pointed out that Beckham has traded heavily on his appeal to children, not least by supporting the Sainsbury’s Active Kids campaign to boost participation in sport.

Consequently, they argued that his association with the drinks brand, which is owned by drinks giant Diageo, sent the wrong message to youngsters that drinking was cool and sexy.

However, advertising watchdogs have rejected the complaint after deciding Beckham could no longer be viewed as a role model or hero for the nation’s children

The father of four’s decision to appear in the Haig Club commercial was the first time he has promoted alcohol and he claims it reflected his own change in tastes as he got older.

The expensive commercial was directed by Guy Ritchie, who previously directed the Sherlock Holmes movies starring Robert Downey Jnr, and played heavily on the theme of Beckham as a style icon.

He was seen as an action man in leathers riding a motorcycle through a spectacular and craggy Scottish landscape before meeting up with friends carrying a bottle of Haig Club.

Then, wearing a green velour suit jacket with a black bow tie, he was seen pouring the drink into tumblers before the group was shown posing for photographs.

The ad ended with a shot of the product and the caption ‘Haig Club single grain scotch whisky. Welcome.’

Alcohol Concern complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), highlighting concerns that David Beckham was promoting any form of alcoholic drink.

They said the commercial, seen on TV and on websites, implied that drinking was a key component of social success or acceptance, and that refusal was a sign of weakness.

And they also argued the commercial broke industry rules by implying drinking was a key component to the success of a personal relationship or social event.

Anti-alcohol campaigners argued that Beckham promoting the whisky implied that alcohol was a key component or social success or acceptance 

The group pointed out Beckham’s partnership with the Sainsbury’s Active Kids campaign, which he is no longer associated with, plus his role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and the fact he won a Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Sports 'Legend' award earlier this year.

However, the ASA rejected the complaint, saying in its view Beckham had not played for a British team for more than ten years and therefore had no special appeal to children.

The watchdog said: ‘We noted that he had not played for a UK club in the last decade and was therefore unlikely to have particular resonance for children on the basis of his sporting career alone, or have strong appeal on that basis.’

That decision has been slammed by Alcohol Concern, whose deputy chief executive, Emily Robinson, said: ‘Given his other roles promoting sport and the importance of a healthy lifestyle, we think the public will be amazed to hear the ASA doesn’t think David Beckham is a role model for children.

‘How can we take the ASA seriously when they deem that a global icon doesn’t appeal to young people and that having one of the most famous people in the world in a whisky advert is not linking the promotion of alcohol with social success?’

She added: ‘This ruling shows why we need tighter restrictions on advertising regulations to ensure children and young people have far greater protection from alcohol advertising.’

At the time the commercial was made, Beckham explained his involvement, saying: ‘The House of Haig has a rich history and I’m proud to be working at the heart of a home-grown brand which has built an incredible heritage over 400 years.

'Working closely with Diageo, we look forward to collaborating on Haig Club, valuing and treasuring the Haig traditions while reinventing this whisky for years to come.'

He added: 'I am starting to enjoy whisky and have done for the last few years. This is a natural movement - but there has had to be a movement.'

Diageo defended the advertisement and campaign on the basis that the footballer was no longer a hero to children in this country. Rather, the firm said it had chosen Beckham because he had a strong appeal to its target group of men aged 25-40.

The ASA said: ‘They stated that his appeal was predominantly to those in this age range and that he did not have strong appeal to children and was not a person whose example children are likely to follow.

‘Diageo stated that Beckham was primarily known for his role as a former professional footballer and that he had limited resonance with young people in the UK, particularly in comparison with current players and other cultural youth icons. They noted that he had not played in the Premier League for over 10 years, retired from professional football in 2013 and had only lived in the UK for two of the last 11 years.’

They provided a list of Beckham's commercial partnerships, including Breitling watches, Belstaff, Jaguar and Las Vegas Sands, as evidence of his appeal to adults rather than children.
