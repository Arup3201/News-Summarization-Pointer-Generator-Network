Historic riverside trees which were admired by Elizabethan diarist Samuel Pepys have been cut down on orders from university bosses.

The 300-year-old cherry trees in the grounds of Cambridge University's Magdalene College, blossom in the spring, and the sight is popular with punters on the river.

But locals say the once picturesque scene is now an eyesore after the trees, which were growing in a conservation area, were cut down.

One punt operator said: 'This is 
usually one of the most beautiful places on the river in the spring time
 when the trees are in bloom, but now it looks terrible.

'We often get requests to punt past the blossom trees, but now it looks an eyesore, with just bare concrete, it's such a shame.'

Magdalene College alumni include Samuel 
Pepys, who wrote parts of his historically significant diary during his time studying for a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1654.

The famous Elizabethan was also briefly an MP for Cambridge and his diaries document such key events as the Great Fire of London and the plague.

Actor Sir Michael Redgrave who appeared in The Great War and The Dambusters also studied at Magdalene.

And CS Lewis, who famously wrote Narnia series of books was a fellow and tutor of English literature at the university.

The riverbank beside the Cam now looks bare after historic cherry trees, which were admired by Samuel Pepys and CS Lewis were chopped down

College chiefs applied to Cambridge City Council to remove the trees saying that they were damaging walls and drains and were in poor condition.

The council approved the plans, but the college will re-plant between five and seven new trees as part of a refurbishment at the site.

Cambridge resident Caroline Hannoway, 53, said: 'I always look forward to seeing the beautiful cherry trees in blossom and they have become quite famous with tourists.

'It looks bare and ugly along the river there now and even if they do plant new trees they will take years to mature.'

Neither the college or the council were available for comment at the time of publication.
