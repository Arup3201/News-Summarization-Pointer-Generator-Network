A new luxury skincare line which is infused with cannabis flower extracts has emerged, promising to treat a host of skin conditions.

Apothecanna, based in weed-friendly Denver, Colarado, is the first company in the U.S. to legally sell cannabis derived skincare products and has launched three debut lotions to the mass public; pain creme, stimulating creme and calming cream - all priced $12 for a tester and $36 for a standard bottle.

According to the brand, the topically applied products won't get you 'inebriated' or show up on a standard drugs test, but they will soothe a variety of skin problems.

Legal: Apothecanna's new range of body lotions (pictured, $36 for a standard bottle) are derived from cannabis flower extracts, which don't produce a high but do reduce pain, swelling and irritation

'Cannabis extracts are highly effective in treating a variety of muscle, joint, nerve and skin conditions', Apothecanna states.

Indeed, the cannabis plant is known to contain more than 400 individual chemicals, some of which have been proven to relieve a multitude of ailments; from epilepsy and multiple sclerosis to the symptoms of AIDS and cancer, when smoked or consumed.

Apothecanna combines flower oil extracted from cannabis plants with other natural plant extracts such as grapefruit, peppermint and lavender, to form lotions that are 'powerful anti-inflammatories', capable of reducing swelling, pain, and irritation.

The line of products was made possible by Colorado's recent Amendment 64 law which, legalized the recreational use of cannabis in the state.

The shipment of Apothecanna products, which are made from medical grade marijuana grown by the company itself, is legal to ship all around the U.S.

Some of its more potent 'extra strength' THC-containing concoctions, however, are only available through licensed medical marijuana centers in Colorado.

Unlike the products available state-wide, this range is described as not having a 'pronounced' inebriating effect, indicating there may be some level of high.

But they do have 'miraculous healing properties not seen anywhere else on the planet', a claim not made for their widely legal range. So for those looking for a proper cannabis-induced skin boost, it might be time for a trip to Colorado.
