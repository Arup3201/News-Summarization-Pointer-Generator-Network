Gareth Bale wants Wales fans to turn up in force once more at the Cardiff City Stadium for the visit of Cyprus on Monday night and insists victory is essential on the road to Euro 2016.

Wales were supported by the biggest home crowd in more than three years during the 0-0 draw with Bosnia and Bale credited the 30,741 with providing the boost in a match previous teams may have lost.

The Real Madrid star did not provide that defining moment he so often has for Wales, missing an excellent early chance before being denied late on by Asmir Begovic.

There is a genuine sense if Wales beat Cyprus that their hopes of reaching a first major tournament since 1958 would gain an edge of realism. ‘We go into Cyprus full of confidence but knowing we need to focus and get the three points,’ said Bale.

‘When you have a full ground, it intimidates the other team and it can intimidate refereeing decisions at times. It gives us a lift when we’re slightly down. We want to make it a fortress.’

Ticket sales are around half the number who turned up for Bosnia but the positive result should prompt a late surge.
