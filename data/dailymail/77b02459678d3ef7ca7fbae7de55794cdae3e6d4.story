For many dads out there, they dream of their son making it as a professional footballer.

But while this has its undoubted challenges, getting your child to support the same football team is surely a must.

In this hilarious video, a young father perches his son on his knee, and begins a chant in honour of his favourite team - Nottingham Forest.

After a reluctant start, 10-month-old Joshua soon throws himself into his father's Nottingham Forest chant

The toddler is well trained it seems, and almost as if he is on the terraces himself, he joins in with the actions football fans everywhere will recognise.

The father shouts out 'Forest,' in reference to the Nottinghamshire club who play their football in Sky Bet Championship.

At this point 10-month old Joshua raises his hands in the air.

'Come on you boys in red,' continues the father, which is met by the blonde-haired child clapping his hands together.

The actions are met with a wide smile and attempts at copying his father's chants. 

With a cheeky smile, Joshua shows he is well on the way to following the Championship club

The man seated then shouts 'Nottingham's red and white' on two occasions, but the toddler's exertions appear to have tired him out, and he holds his hands behind his head.

Nottingham Forest are sitting ten points of a play-off place in the Championship, and facing a tall order to reach the promised land of the Premier League.

Maybe when he's older, Joshua might get to see Forest taking on the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal.
