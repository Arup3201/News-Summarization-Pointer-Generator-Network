Holiday homes don't come much more memorable that this Cornish bolthole, designed by IT technician Michael Collins, which remarkably resembles one of the county's icons, the Eden Project.

Visitors can stay in the moon pod-like residence in St Ives, set in the middle of a private two acre lot, for £1,885 per week.

The bizarre structure is located on top of St Ives town, surrounded by wildlife and frequented by herds of llamas and a goat called Billy.

Michael Collins designed the Escape Podz accommodation after leaving his job at Salford University to start a new life in the south-west with his partner Eileen Sweeney.

The luxury 'glamping' holiday let sleeps four and is based on a mathematical sphere known as a geodesic dome.

There are two bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom and hot tub and guests  can peer out at sweeping views through a 30ft panoramic window.

While the strange shape has left some locals baffled, Michael says town planners are fully behind the  design.

The first of many? Michael is already planning their second dome, but this one will be a therapeutic retreat

He said: 'I was made redundant from the University of Salford so Eileen and I decided to do something exciting in our lives.

'We had the idea of building a glamping luxury holiday let from a geodesic dome to see if there was any interest in the concept.

'We spoke to the planning department who, to our surprise, loved the idea. They agreed in principle to give us three years to trial the project, so we started to build it.

The site, located in a former Kaolinite pit, houses plants from all around the world

'We wanted to create an incredible, over-the-top, dream destination and I think we've achieved that.'

Michael and Eileen are planning their second dome, which will be a therapeutic retreat and recovery centre for people with physical or mental health issues.

Michael said: 'We've already been working with organisations like Children in Need, the National Autistic Society, Help For Heroes and loads of other good causes.

'We want to share our wonderful pod with people who will appreciate it the most.'
