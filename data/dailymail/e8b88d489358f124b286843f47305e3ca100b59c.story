A nine-year-old girl who shaved her head in support of a friend with cancer has been barred from her school for violating its dress code.

Kamryn Renfro, from Grand Junction, Colorado, thought she was making a kind gesture by shaving off her hair to support Delaney Clements, 12, who is also bald after undergoing chemotherapy.

'It felt like the right thing to do,' Kamryn told KUSA.

Delaney, who suffers from neuroblastoma, said: 'I was really excited that I would have somebody to support me and I wouldn't be alone with people always laughing at me', KREX reported.

'It made me feel very special and that I'm not alone.'

But Kamryn's school, Caprock Academy, said she could not attend classes because girls' shaved heads violated the dress code policy.

The school told her she could not return to class until she wore a wig or her grew her hair back.

Kamryn's mother emailed the school 
explaining why the little girl had chopped off her braids, but - at first - administrators
said they were unable to exceptions.

Grateful: Delaney, right, told her friend she was thankful to her for making her feel less alone

The girls' mothers were shocked at the decision.

'Friends support each other no matter 
what and this is a brave girl and we should support her and the fact 
that she made that decision,' said Wendy Campbell, Delaney's mother.

'For a little girl to be really brave 
and want to shave her head in support of her friend, I thought that was a
 huge statement and it builds character in a child.'

Jamie Renfro, Kamryn's mother, 
thanked friends for their support on her Facebook page, while noting 
that the school had been respectful when dealing with the family.We still support Kamryn a gazillion percent, and could not be more proud of her,' she said.

Disbelief: Delaney's mother, Wendy Campbell, said she was stunned by the school's unexpected reaction

Fighter: Delaney, with her mother, suffers from neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer affecting the nerves

Even though the school did not take note of the gesture, Delaney did.

'I just want to say thank-you for being a
 really good friend and actually being brave enough to do it, and not 
only caring about your hair,' she told her friend, KREX reported.

But the academy later said Kamryn could return to classes on Tuesday and the school's board of directors is expected to discuss her situation.

Catherine Norton, chairwoman of the board, said the dress code is designed to promote uniformity and a non-distracting environment. She said exceptions can be made in certain circumstances.
