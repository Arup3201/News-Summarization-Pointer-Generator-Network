Aviation experts have warned space enthusiasts not to send helium weather balloons up into the sky - as one could be enough to bring down a plane.

Last week two Canadian teenagers Mathew Ho and Asad Muhammad sent a Lego man into space using a home-stitched parachute and spare parts found on Craigslist.

The 17-year-olds, from Toronto, made headlines after the two-inch astronaut clutching a Canadian flag attached to a helium weather balloon went 80,000 feet into the air - three times the height of a commercial jet's cruising altitude.

An airline pilot has said that any copycats who try out the experiment could put lives at risk.

Captain Barry Wiszniowski, from the Air 
Canada Pilots Association’s safety division, told the Toronto Star: 'A 
pilot might not have enough reaction time if such a balloon popped up 
unexpectedly.

'With the speed of a plane, the impact could be similar to a
bird strike and could cause damage, especially if something was sucked 
into an engine.'

The two teenagers managed to capture the entire 97-minute journey which began on a 
football pitch using four cameras set to take photos every 20
seconds, reports the Toronto Star.

They were left with astonishing 
footage from an estimated 24 kilometres above sea level which showed the
toy floating above the curvature of our planet before beginning a 32 
minute descent back to earth.

Having
attached a GPS receiver to the styrofoam box carrying the cameras and 
Lego man, the teens were able to recover their Lego man which landed 
122km from the launch site.

When
the teens got home and uploaded the two videos and 1,500 photos onto a 
computer, they told the Star that they started screaming with joy.

Their
footage shows the Lego man spinning at an altitude three times higher 
than the peak of Mount Everest, before the balloon bursts and he starts 
to plummet.

'We never knew it would be this good,' Ho told the Star.
