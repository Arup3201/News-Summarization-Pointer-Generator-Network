Santi Cazorla says he will assess his Arsenal future after the World Cup. 

The Spanish midfielder has been linked with a move away from the Emirates and has hinted he may be interested in a switch to La Liga champions and Champions League runners-up Atletico Madrid.

Cazorla, who is currently with the Spain squad preparing for Wednesday's World Cup game against Chile, joined Arsenal from Malaga for £16.5million in 2012.

‘When the World Cup is over, I’ll start thinking about my situation,' said Cazorla, who was speaking to Spanish newspaper AS.

‘I don’t want to be thinking about it right now and I’ve told my agents not to tell me anything if an offer comes in.

‘But I know a few of the Atlético players – Godín, Juanfran and I know the side well from when I was playing the Spanish league but until the tournament is over, I won’t know if the rumours are true or not.’

Arsenal triggered an option to extend the 29-year-old's contract, which was due to expire in 2016, by an extra 12 months and increased his wages to £80,000 per week in March.
