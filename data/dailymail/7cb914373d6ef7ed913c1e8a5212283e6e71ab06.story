Turning a blind eye: Meredith Yayanos was sexually harassed while waiting for a bus in San Francisco last week and when she asked the driver for help, he ignored her

A Bay Area woman threatened with rape while waiting for a bus in downtown San Francisco last week was refused help when her shuttle finally arrived in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Meredith Yayanos had taken the bus into San Francisco to attend a concert December 16, and was waiting for her bus back to Sausilto around midnight when a stranger invaded her personal space, looked her up and down, and asked: 'Hey baby, how you doin?'

When she refused to engage the man, he became infuriated and refused to leave her alone.

Ms Yayanos, a musician, detailed the terrifying experience in a blog post, writing that the man called her a b**** and a stuck-up ho before moving on to scarier threats.

As he got closer and closer, the man threatened to beat and rape her - at one point unzipping his pants.

'I am going to slap you, b****,' he said. 'You deserve to get raped. You deserve a d*** in your ***. Stuck-up ugly s***. You’re gonna get raped because you’re a b**** and b****s deserve whatever they get.'

Ms Yayano's phone had died, so she couldn't call for help. But since she was in a brightly lit area, she decided to hold her ground until the bus came.

When it finally arrived she rushed on, told the driver about the man's threats and asked him not to let him on board.

Bad end to the night: Yayanos had attended a concert in San Francisco Monday night and was waiting for a Golden Gate Transit bus back to Sausilito when the incident happened

Approached: A man came up to her at the bus stop at Mission and Fifth in downtown San Francisco, calling her babe and asking her 'How you doin?'

Her aggressor then pushed past her and sat down in the front seat.

'Pay this b**** no mind, she's a crazy-*** prostitute' he said, adding 'she been harassing ME.'

Instead of ordering the man off the bus or calling the police, the driver ignored Ms Yayanos, and even shook her harasser's hand, laughing along with him.

'I was stunned' Ms Yayanos wrote. 'I stood at the head of the bus and kept saying "why aren't you listening to me? Please call the cops. Don't let him stay on the bus."'

'Sit your ass down, b****,' her harasser said. The man then seemed to imply that she was racist, announcing that he was moving to the back of the bus 'where I belong'.

Threatened: When she refused to acknowledge his advances, the man became agitated and threatened to beat and  rape her - even going so far as to unzip his pants

She stood at the front of the bus until the driver ordered her to sit down.

In her seat, Ms Yayano continued to ask why he wouldn't help but was met with silence.

Before getting off at her stop, Ms Yayano wrote down the bus number since the driver refused to give out his name.

The next morning, she called the Golden Gate Transit hotline to file a complaint. In her post, she wrote that she doesn't want to get the driver fired, but hopes this incident will lead to change in protocol within the transportation organization.

'He seemed young, totally clueless and lacking in empathy, but not actively unkind,' she wrote. 

Helen Moore, Golden Gate Transit's 
customer relations supervisor, called Ms Yayanos the day she filed the 
complaint to tell her the company was investigating the matter 'at the 
highest level of our organization'.

Two days later, the transit company updated Ms Yayanos on Twitter saying the bus driver admitted 'proper action wasn't taken' and that appropriate disciplinary action was underway.

Ms Yayanos tweeted that she was grateful for the apology, but stressed she didn't want to get the driver fired and that disciplinary action might be scapegoating and wouldn't fix a possible systemic problem.

The company tweeted that the problem was not systemic and that all of the drivers receive extensive training, which the driver in question did not follow.
