A new phase of drilling for shale gas, which the Government hopes will revolutionise Britain’s energy supply, was given the go-ahead yesterday.

The controversial technique of extracting the gas from subterranean rock – known as fracking – was suspended last year after it was believed to have caused two small earthquakes in Lancashire.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said new conditions had now been imposed to minimise the risk of seismic activity.

However, he did recognise the environmental concerns of those living near shale gas wells, which could soon spring up in many parts of the country.

Fears have been expressed over possible water pollution and nuisance from lorries transporting equipment, but Mr Davey pledged to address them.

‘It is essential that shale gas development should not come at the expense of local communities,’ he said. ‘Fracking must be safe and the public must be confident that it is safe.

‘We are strengthening the stringent regime already in place with new  controls around seismic risks. And as the industry develops we will remain vigilant to all emerging evidence to ensure the local environment is protected.’

Advocates of fracking – the process by which water and chemicals are pumped into shale deposits at high pressure to release trapped pockets of gas – say it will end our dependence on expensive imports and protect consumers from rising prices, as North Sea gas reserves dwindle.

David Cameron this week backed the technology and said Britain should be at the heart of the shale ‘gas revolution’, claiming it could bring down the price of household energy bills.

Lib Dem Mr Davey was more cautious yesterday, saying only that shale gas would hold down future gas price rises rather than slash them, as has happened in the US.

Nearly two-thirds of the country could be sitting on estimated gas reserves of up to 300trillion cubic feet, according to industry experts – enough to supply Britain for 120 years.

But it is not yet clear how much of the trapped gas is recoverable, with drilling so far restricted to Lancashire, where energy firm Cuadrilla Resources has dug four exploratory wells.

When it announced its finds last year, Cuadrilla said it would drill up to 800 wells over 16 years and, if production was successful, it could create thousands of jobs and generate £5billion-£6billion in tax revenues.

The Department of Energy and Climate Change has granted 176 exploration licences across Britain, although holders still require further consent before fracking can commence. It is thought fracking will not begin again until late March at the earliest because Cuadrilla will need to secure fresh planning permission for its wells.

There is growing local concern about fracking in Lancashire, as well as other areas thought to be rich in shale gas such as Sussex and South Wales.

The Campaign to Protect Rural England yesterday warned of a greater backlash if large areas of countryside were ‘transformed into industrial sites’ with a steady stream of lorries transporting gas and polluted water away from drilling sites.

Paul Miner, the CPRE’s senior planning officer, said: ‘The Government doesn’t appear to have recognised the potential for major landscape damage, or the need to properly consider this at the local level.’

The rural splendour of George Osborne’s constituency in Cheshire could be blighted by his enthusiasm for shale gas exploration.

Tatton
includes unspoilt countryside, the historic towns of Knutsford and 
Wilmslow, and villages such as Alderley Edge – said to have more 
millionaires per square mile than anywhere else in the country.

Professor
Peter Styles of Keele University said the rocks in Tatton are of 
interest to energy firms as they are from the same period as those in 
Lancashire, where exploratory drilling suggests there could be enough 
shale gas to power Britain for decades. He added shale gas exploration 
requires ‘around a football pitch worth of land’ per site.

A
report from the Royal Academy of Engineering also lists Cheshire as an 
area of interest for ‘fracking’ – the technique used to extract the gas.

But
exploration in the area could be opposed by residents, who have been 
swift to protest against threats to the countryside in the past

Concerns have also been raised that fracking could pose a threat to Bath’s world-famous hot springs if a test-drill for gas was allowed in the area by the local authority.

In the US, households near to wells have complained of increased traffic and polluted water supplies.

But the Institute of Directors stressed that if the environmental fears could be allayed, shale gas offered great potential for the future.

Its senior economic adviser Corin Taylor said the UK’s energy mix must include more gas, along with green energy and nuclear power, to meet carbon targets.

And energy minister John Hayes added that the Government had taken ‘the very best’ scientific advice on fracking and said: ‘We have out every safeguard in place; this is the most rigorous regime in the world, I think.’

However, some in Mr Davey’s party remain unconvinced that shale gas will provide the predicted energy revolution.

A senior Lib Dem source told the Daily Mail: ‘There is no principled objection to shale gas. But all these Tories calling for it could be in for a rude awakening.

'Shale gas wells will generate a lot of traffic and disruption. It could make objections to onshore wind look like a picnic.’

Environmentalists fear a ‘dash for gas’ could also prevent Britain meeting its climate change targets.

But Mr Davey said these would be met, despite resumption of fracking.

He said: ‘Shale gas represents a promising new potential energy resource for the UK. It could contribute significantly to our energy security, reducing our reliance on imported gas.’

The new controls will include a ‘traffic light system’, requiring operators to stop if seismic activity reaches 0.5 on the Richter scale.

An industry source said: ‘The new threshold is very conservative – it’s the equivalent of a large vehicle driving past on the road.’

So how serious are the environmental concerns?

By David Derbyshire

Shale gas could become the greatest contribution to Britain’s energy supplies since the North Sea boom of the 1970s. But those against fracking say the environmental consequences outweigh the benefits. So what are those concerns and how serious are they?

Earthquakes

Much has been made of the suspension of exploratory fracking at Blackpool last year after two small quakes of Richter scale magnitude 1.5 and 2.2 were recorded. The Cuadrilla drilling company said that its operations were probably responsible.

But they were too minor to do any damage – and according to the British Geological Survey there were nine tremors in the UK of the same magnitude in the past two months alone. 

A follow-up study by the Department for Energy and Climate Change concluded that the risk of earthquakes caused by fracking was low, and structural damage to buildings, bridges and roads was extremely unlikely.

POLLUTION

Millions of gallons of water and chemicals are forced into the ground during fracking operations, and there are concerns that some of the residue could leak into the water table.

However, Parliament’s Energy Select Committee says there is little risk to water supplies in the UK, as long as the drilling is done correctly.

Anger: Demonstrators hold placards in front of their mock fracking rig in protest outside the Houses of Parliament

Leaks
in America have been caused by badly maintained wells which haven’t 
been lined properly. British supporters of shale gas development say 
rules are tougher here. 

US
companies are also allowed to store dirty water from fracking wells in 
open tanks, whereas in Britain fracking companies will have to store the
water in sealed containers on site.

Concerns
have also been expressed about chemicals leaking from gas wells into 
underground water aquifers and reaching the domestic supply. However, 
most fracking is done thousands of feet deep – far below the water 
table. 

Energy Secretary Ed Davey made a statement to Parliament on the Government's new policy on shale gas

US
protesters have complained about methane getting into their drinking 
water. Again, the industry says this was caused by bad fracking. If 
wells are lined, there is no reason why methane should escape.

THREAT TO THE LANDSCAPE

The Department of Energy and Climate Change says nearly two thirds of Britain lies over shale gas reserves.

If the predicted boom materialises, gas wells could spring up across the countryside. While they are not as imposing as wind farms, pylons or power stations, this would represent some industrialisation of rural Britain.

Cuadrilla concedes that drilling and fracking rigs would be visible from a distance, but would be on site for only a few months. After that, they say wells could be screened from view.

NUISANCE

Fleets of lorries will be needed to bring in excavation, drilling and storage equipment to create the well, and to bring the sand and chemicals for the fracking process. In the short term, shale gas would also be taken away by lorries, though it is cheaper to pipe it out. Over time, however, gas companies will almost certainly create a network of new gas pipes.

THE BENEFITS

In America, fracking has slashed domestic gas prices and there could be similar major effects on household energy bills in the UK.

David Cameron believes shale gas will eventually bring down prices here. Energy Secretary Ed Davey is a little more cautious, however, saying only that it will hold price increases down – but even that would be a relief to the long-suffering consumer.

What is beyond doubt is that shale gas would reduce our reliance on imports, particularly those from Russia.The UK could also reduce reliance on piped gas from overseas by investing in desperately needed storage.

In environmental terms, shale gas is deemed to be cleaner than coal and oil, though slightly less clean than North Sea gas.
