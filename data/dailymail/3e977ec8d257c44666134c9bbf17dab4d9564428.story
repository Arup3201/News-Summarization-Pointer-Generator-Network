Barack Obama announced Friday that the rebels believed to be behind the rocket attack on a Malaysian Airlines jetliner in eastern Ukraine have had 'a steady stream of support from Russia,' but stopped short of calling for an immediate pushback against Moscow.

The U.S. president's brief but substantial comments about deaths that he called 'an outrage of unspeakable proportions' came 24 hours after he coolly inserted a 40-second statement about the plane crash into a 16-minute oration about domestic transportation policy, drawing gasps and guffaws from Americans.

'This certainly will be a wake-up call for Europe and the world that there are consequences to escalating a regional conflict in the Ukraine,' he said in the White House press briefing room on Friday, cautioning that it's not yet completely clear 'what individuals, or groups of individuals ordered the strike.'

But 'it is not possible for these separatists to function the way they're functioning' without Moscow's involvement, he insisted.

'A group of separatists can't shoot down military transport planes ... without sophisticated training and sophisticated equipment. And that is coming from Russia.'

Obama said Moscow is supporting the rebel faction that brought down MH17, but only threatened new sanctions

The president also announced the name of the sole American known to have been aboard the Boeing 777 when a Russian-made rocket slammed into it at 32,000 feet

Obama revealed Friday that Quinn Lucas Schansman, a U.S.-Dutch dual citizen, was on his way to meet family members who were vacationing in Malaysia when his plane was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile

Russian President Vladimir Putin 'has the most control over that situation,' Obama said. 'And so far, at least, he has not exercised it.'

Those words came off as softer than those of his former top diplomat, Hillary Clinton, who is presumed to be running to replace him in two years' time.

A network of high-tech eavesdropping and early-warning satellites operated by the Pentagon most likely played a key role in determining that the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile over the Ukraine. 

According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, intelligence officials almost certainly relied on a technical discipline known as measurement and signature intelligence, also known as MASINT, to obtain key bits of information about the missile launch.

The sophisticated system of satellites at the Pentagon’s disposal could have pinpointed the location from which the missile was fired and plotted out its trajectory as it shot up into the sky on a collision course with the MH17 Flight.

Riki Ellison, founder and chairman of Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, an industry lobby, told the paper that intelligence analysts would have become aware the missile launch because of its heat signature.

U.S. Air Force-operated satellites orbiting the Earth are equipped with hyper-sensitive sensors that pick up on heat from missile and booster plumes. In fact, the detectors are so fine-tuned that they even spot forest fires. 

The system of satellites, run as part of the Defense Support Program, sends back early warnings each time it detects an intercontinental ballistic missile launch.

Also, American radars scattered around Europe have the capacity to provide data on the exact launch site, the missile’s destination and its speed.

The other vital intelligence tool is a fleet of U.S. listening satellites that collect electronic signals from foreign defense systems.

Armed with this data, U.S. analysts would be able to determine the source of the signals and the weapon used.

The Russian-made Buk missiles, like the one that downed the jet Thursday with 298 people on board, are equipped with a radar system that gives off unique signals, making it possible to triangulate the launch site and trace its route.

The U.S. needs to 'put Putin on notice that he has gone too far and we are not going to stand idly by,' she told PBS host Charlie Rose on Thursday night.

'Commercial airliners are big targets, but by the time they got over that part of Ukraine they should have been high, so it takes some planning.'

Obama demanded 'an immediate cease-fire' on Friday so the 298 dead could be recovered and the crash scene secured. The downed Boeing 777, he said, 'should snap everybody's heads to attention' on the question of Russia's hand in supporting anti-government forces in eastern Ukraine.

'We don't have time for propaganda, we don't have time for games,' he said.

But the U.S., he said, does have time for 'a credible international investigation' to take place.

He said investigators from the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board were en route to eastern Ukraine to help determine the details of what happened as the aircraft, carrying 298 souls between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, flew at 32,000 feet near the intersection of Ukrainian and Russian airspace.

'Are they going to continue to support violent separatists whose goal is to overthrow the government of Ukraine?' Obama asked.

'As Russia engages in efforts that are supporting the separatists, we have the capacity to increase the costs we impose on them, and we will do so.'

But Obama hasn't hinted at what a new round of sanctions might look like.

Just this week his administration imposed new financial penalties and restrictions on a range of Russian-owned banks and other businesses, freezing them out of long-term U.S. bank borrowing.

It's unclear whether his State Department has contemplated what a broader sanctions package would look like.

Secretary of State John Kerry has been quiet on the question, and the president indicated Friday that such talk would be a cart before the horse.

'We don't know exactly what happened yet,' he said, urging Americans not to 'get out ahead of the facts.'

Obama 
named a single American on Friday, Quinn Lucas Schansman, as 'the sole 
person that we can definitively say is a U.S. or dual citizen' and was 
on the doomed aircraft.

On Thursday reports swirled of as many as 23 Americans having been on board.

U.S.
 Senator John McCain said Thursday that there would be 'hell to pay, and
 there should be,' if Russian forces or pro-Russian separatists in 
Ukraine were behind the missile attack.

McCain unleashed: The hawkish senator warned that there would be 'hell to pay' if Russia or its proxies were responsible for downing a passenger plane

'This was an airliner headed towards Russian airspace,' the Arizona Republican said on MSNBC. 'And it has the earmarks – and I'm not concluding – but it has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was Ukrainian.'

'If that's true, this is a horrible tragic event which was certainly unanticipated by anybody no matter who they are. And there will be incredible repercussions if this is the case.'

'If it is the result of either separatist or Russian actions mistakenly believing that this is a Ukrainian warplane,' McCain warned, 'I think there's going to be hell to pay and there should be.'

The 
senator's comments came as recovery workers began to pick through mounds
 of luggage, airplane sections and even human remains in a nine-mile 
debris field where the Boeing 777 went down Thursday.

He
 also told host Andrew Mitchell that President Barack Obama has 
mishandled the Ukraine crisis by going soft on Russian President 
Vladimir Putin and refusing to arm Ukrainian government forces.

'The
 United States – it has been insulting in how small and how little help 
we have given,' he complained. 'I mean, they have been begging us for 
defensive weaponry [but] we have not given it to them.'

McCain also slammed the White House for the shallowness of economic sanctions the U.S. has pushed on Moscow after Putin annexed a region of Ukraine that was populated mainly by ethnic Russians.

'The sanctions so far in exchange for Crimea have been minuscule,' said McCain.

'These latest enacted by the Obama administration, I think, are helpful. But if you ask the Ukrainian government that's struggling, they said they need weapons [with] which to defend themselves.'

Earlier in the day McCain went directly after Putin, telling Roll Call that if the plane was fired on by 'separatists, which are also Russian, Vladimir Putin should be paying a heavy price.'

Putin on Thursday called the idea of Russian government involvement in the plane's destruction 'stupidity' and blamed Ukraine.

'This tragedy would not have occurred if there was peace in that land,' he said, at least if hostilities had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine.'

'And without question, the state over whose territory this took place bears responsibility for this awful tragedy.'

U.S. officials said Thursday that they are certain the passenger plane was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile.

The Associated Press reported that Soviet-era 'Buk' missile systems have been spotted in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by separatist fighters.

Video surfaced on Friday showing that specific anti-aircraft weapon system being hauled into Russia. The apparatus was missing two of its four missiles.
