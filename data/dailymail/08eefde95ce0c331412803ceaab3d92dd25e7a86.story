George Osborne’s personal finances came under fierce scrutiny yesterday after he insisted he was not wealthy enough to pay the 50p tax rate.

Sources close to the Prime Minister admitted that David Cameron does earn more than the £150,000 threshold for top-rate tax – and will benefit from the announcement that it will be cut to 45p.

But the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who earns a Cabinet salary of £134,565, insisted he would not benefit from his own policy.

During a BBC radio interview, Mr Osborne was adamant: ‘My salary is less than the £150,000 threshold... so I am not personally affected.’

Quizzed about other income which might take him over the threshold, he replied: ‘I am not a big winner from this budget.’

Asked again if he was a 50p tax rate payer, the Chancellor – one of the wealthiest Cabinet members – added: ‘I’m not actually, no.’

But his claim appeared to be unravelling last night as it emerged that while Mr Osborne may not be paying the full rate this financial year, he probably will have to pay the 50p rate in his next tax return.

The Chancellor would need extra income of just £15,435 to reach the £150,000 threshold – and eventually benefit from his controversial decision to cut the top rate.

During a series of interviews, Mr Osborne failed to mention an additional six-figure annual income he and wife Frances receive from letting their £3million home in Notting Hill, one of the wealthiest parts of London.

Mr Osborne’s tax return for 2010-11 would not have included the lucrative rental income that began flowing into the Osborne bank account months later.

Nor did he talk about his shareholding in the family’s upmarket fabrics and wallpaper firm Osborne & Little, reputed to be worth more than £4million.

Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said: ‘We were all astonished to learn from the Chancellor this morning that he was not a top-rate taxpayer.

‘The hunt is now on for the name of his accountant, who will surely find himself in spectacular demand.’

Mr Osborne, who told MPs during his Budget speech that he regarded ‘tax evasion and, indeed, aggressive tax avoidance, as morally repugnant’, refused to discuss his personal finances in detail last night.

An aide insisted he was not a tax dodger but made clear his denial that he pays 50p tax only covers his last tax return – a legalistic distinction unlikely to be appreciated by voters struggling to make ends meet.

An aide to the Chancellor told the 
Mail: ‘In the most recent tax year, George Osborne was a higher rate 
taxpayer [the 40p rate].

‘He
has his salary and part of the rental income from one property that has
a mortgage on it. He makes no use of tax avoidance schemes.’  Asked if 
the Chancellor would pay the 50p rate in his 2011/12 tax return, one 
source said: ‘You can’t say that for certain. He goes through the normal
process of self-assessment and those things are worked out later.’

But
the source repeatedly declined the opportunity to deny that Mr Osborne 
was likely to have earned enough over the past year to put him in the 
top tier of taxpayers.

According to the MPs’ register of interests, Mr Osborne declares two additional sources of income apart from his ministerial salary – rental from a ‘residential property in London,’ and ‘registrable shareholdings’ in Osborne & Little.

The Chancellor only registered the rental income from July last year, when he moved his family from their elegant five-storey Notting Hill home into the flat above 10 Downing Street.

Similar houses in the trendy West London area can command rentals of upwards of £4,000 a week – giving Mr Osborne and his novelist wife a potential extra income of well over £200,000 a year.

However, Land Registry documents show the house is jointly owned by Mr and Mrs Osborne and there are two mortgages – one with Barclays and another with a private bank – registered against the property.

It is not known how much the Osbornes have to pay in monthly mortgage repayments, but they could legitimately cut the size of their tax bill by off-setting both mortgage interest payments and any maintenance costs.

This would have the effect of cutting the ‘profit’ they made each month on the house. Mr Osborne is also a beneficiary of a trust fund which owns 15 per cent of the Osborne & Little family business founded by his father, the baronet Sir Peter Osborne.

According to accounts filed at Companies House the firm, which has a turnover of £23million, has suffered losses for the past three years and no dividend was paid to shareholders in the last financial year – but £1,476,720 was paid out in 2010.

Aides suggested the Chancellor did not draw an income from his shareholding in the last tax year.
