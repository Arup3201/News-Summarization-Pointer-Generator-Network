Having good manners is more important as good grades when it comes to forging a career, the editor of society bible Tatler has told an audience of public schoolgirls.

Speaking to pupils at £30,000-a-year Westonbirt School for Girls in Gloucestershire, Kate Reardon, 46, said young women should focus on good impressions rather than good qualifications.

She told the girls: 'It doesn’t matter how many A-levels you have, what kind of a degree you have, if you have good manners people will like you. And, if they like you, they will help you.'

Top tips: Kate Reardon said it was easy to avoid face-to-face contact in the modern digital age but urged the public school pupils 'never hide behind a computer or mobile phone'

Ms Reardon, who was educated at the elite Cheltenham Ladies College and Stowe Schools, rejected a place at the University of Exeter in order to become a journalist at the age of 19.

Now she is suggesting to other public school girls that getting top grades will not necessarily guarantee a top career.

Ms Reardon said it was easy to avoid face-to-face 
contact in the modern digital age but urged the pupils 'never hide behind a
 computer or mobile phone'.

According to Ms Reardon - who launched her own website TopTips.com in 2007 and released the acclaimed book 'Top Tips for Girls' a year later - good manners are the key to success.

'I’m not talking about manners about using the right spoon for soup or eating asparagus with your left hand.. I’m talking about being polite and respectful and making people you interact with feel valued, she told Westonbirt School for Girls pupils.

Kate Reardon was born in New York in 1968 but describes her own education as 'thoroughly British.'

She attended several elite establishments - including Garden House School, Bute House Prep School for Girls, Cheltenham Ladies' College and Stowe School.

But aged 19 she rejected a place at the University of Exeter in order to pursue a soon-to-be glittering career in journalism.

That year she became U.S. Vogue's youngest ever fashion assistant staying at the company for two years.

At 21, she was named the youngest ever fashion editor at Tatler - a role she kept for nine years before becoming contributing editor at Vanity Fair.

She spent 11 years at the pop culture magazine, before eventually being appointed overall editor of Tatler in 2010.

In 2007 Ms Reardon launched her own website, TopTips.com, which was released as a book titled 'Top Tips for Girls' the following year to much acclaim.

She is the 17th editor of Tatler since the high society magazine's launch in 1909.

Ms Reardon told the girls that, although they have all grown up in the digital age where avoiding 'eyeball-to-eyeball' interaction is easy, it is important to maintain a real-world persona.

'Never hide behind a computer or 
mobile phone if you want to communicate your truth - they need to know who 
you are and they need to understand you,' she said.

Organisation is a key part of success, Ms Reardon said, insisting 'chaotic isn't cute' - especially when it comes to applying for jobs.

Last year actress Joanna Lumley told girls at the £9,990-a-term Westonbirt School for Girls that they should stay in work and never rely on benefits. 

'You must swear never to go on the dole, find something to do,' she said.

'By
 doing you become employable. It doesn’t matter what the job is, by 
working you learn new things, meet new people and are exposed to new 
ideas,' the Absolutely Fabulous star added.

Westonburt
 is described as one of the country’s leading same-sex schools with the 
vast majority of girls winning places at their chosen universities every
 year.

Last year half of all pupils received A* for GCSE English and 36 per cent of all A levels achieved the same grade.

The pass rate was A level exams was 100 per cent. 

Speaking to the girls, Tatler editor Ms Reardon admitted she felt completely unprepared for her first job at Vogue.

She said: 'I was entirely unqualified for life at American Vogue.

'If you've ever seen The Devil Wears Prada you'll know what my life was like.

'I was the fat, badly dressed one. They used to take bets in front of me on how long I was going to last. But they were right.

'I'd come from a culture which placed no value in work for its own sake.

'There's a particularly British wariness of appearing to try too hard. It's somehow distasteful. Everything should come to us seamlessly and, if you have to work at it, you're somehow a loser.'

But she told pupils how she quickly learned the 'American work ethic', was helpful getting her the job as Tatler's youngest ever fashion editor, aged 21.

She added: 'When I first got there, I really struggled with Tatler's position of immense privilege.

'It has the wealthiest readers of any magazine in England and so deals with the concerns of the very rich.

'Then again, the business model of this very successful glossy magazine which employs many people and has the power to promote so many brilliant businesses is built on exactly that premise and so it's nothing to be ashamed of.

'I have a career I love more than I can tell you and I have it because I work incredibly hard pretty much every single day.

'And you know what? I'm really proud of working hard - not just the level of sucking up and free handbags I now get because of my job, but because it's an achievement in itself.'

Kate's final parting advice to the 'younger generation' was to work hard and be ready to seize opportunities.

'Luck is going to play a huge part in your life,' she said.

'Do the work, read the books, be prepared, but also embrace luck when it comes your way. Constantly look out for it and grab it.'

Natasha Dangerfield, headmistress of Westonbirt School, said she agreed with Kate.

She said: 'Good communication skills and good manners are vital for getting on in life, whatever we do.

'Kate is absolutely right and she is a great role model for the girls.

'There is only one secret to success and that is hard work.

'I didn't get my job because of connections. I got it because of my skills, my experience and my hard work.

'We aim to instill that work ethic and attitude in all our students.'
