Is Vidic right to quit Manchester United?

Nemanja Vidic will start the bidding for his services at a staggering £4million per season after tax.

The Manchester United defender has confirmed he will leave after eight trophy-laden seasons with the club.

Vidic will be one of the most sought after free agents in the summer transfer window - and the Serbian defender is ready to cash in on his status.

Knowing this will be his last major playing contract, the central-defender, who currently earns in the region of £4.5million a year before tax, will demand a huge final pay-day before committing to his next destination.

Vidic's officials have already held talks with various clubs about a Bosman move for next season.

Sportsmail understands the 32-year-old already has up to five firm proposals from the European clubs to join next season.

Among them are Galatasary, Inter Milan, Monaco and Zenit St Petersburg.

All fine: David Moyes has given Vidic his blessing and can do nothing to stop other clubs approaching him

Details of Galatasary's offer emerged last month following talks with the Turkish club, who are using UK-based agent Muzzi Ozcan to broker the deal.

Galatasary manager Roberto Mancini has already confirmed his interest in Vidic and the club have already made an initial proposal of £3million, including up to £415,000 worth of bonuses, per season after tax.

Given the interest in Vidic, Galatasary may need to improve upon the original offer to land the defender next season, with Ozcan - who was at the centre of the Turkish club's plan to land John Terry last season - still working on the deal.

Interested: Roberto Mancini is a fan of Vidic and will look to bring him to Galatasaray
