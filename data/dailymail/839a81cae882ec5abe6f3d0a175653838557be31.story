A loose-lipped supplier who hinted that Apple were slowing down production of iPads and iPhones wiped $22billion off the company's market value yesterday.

Shares fell below $400 for the first time in a year and a half, following the comments from audio chip supplier Cirrus Logic.

The decline means Apple has lost its
position as the world's most valuable publicly traded company to Exxon 
Mobil, which has a market capitalisation a few billion dollars above 
Apple's $380 billion price tag.

Apple shares yesterday fell briefly below $400 - the first time they had been below that level since 2011

Apple's stock price over the last year: Earlier in the day, it hit $398.11, the lowest level since December 2011

The stock was down $21.89, or 5.1 
percent, at $404.35 in early afternoon trading, and earlier in the day, 
it hit $398.11, the lowest level since December 2011.

Late Tuesday, Cirrus Logic, which supplies audio chips for the iPhone and iPad, said sales of a particular chip are slowing down as an unnamed customer moves to a newer component.

Cirrus did not name the customer, but Apple accounted for over 90 
percent of its business in the December quarter.

Analyst Peter Misek at Jefferies & Co said Cirrus's news suggests a big decline in Apple sales in the April to June period.

That supports his view that Apple is unlikely to launch a new iPad Mini in the quarter, and that the next version of the full-size iPad may launch late in the quarter rather than early.

'It is now very clear that Apple's 
market share has reached the peak, given that Samsung has taken a big 
chunk of it and HTC has had a few nice models since last year,' said Andrew Wang, Chief Investment Officer of Manulife Asset Management in Taiwan.

In the last three years, Apple has launched a new iPad in March or April.

Some analysts also say Apple cannot sustain its high profit margins as competition in the tablet and smartphone markets forces the company to lower prices.

'This is a tough environment, Apple is in transition between products,' 
said Michael Yoshikami, a portfolio manager at Destination Wealth 
Management, which owns about 50,000 Apple shares.

Cirrus's warning 'makes it more likely Apple's not going to surprise on upside.'

Apple does not comment on its suppliers' announcements or its product plans.

It is set to report results for the January to March quarter on Tuesday.

In the past week, analysts had reduced their revenue estimates to $42.53 billion from $42.68 billion, with net profit expected to decline 17 percent to $9.59 billion.

The latest decline in the stock comes after a bruising winter for Apple.

The company's stock is down 42 percent from its all-time high of $705.07, hit on September 21 when the iPhone 5 went on sale.
