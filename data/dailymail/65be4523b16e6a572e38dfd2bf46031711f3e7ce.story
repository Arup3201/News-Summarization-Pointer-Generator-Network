Manpower: Treasury Minister David Gauke has admitted the child benefits cuts would need 450 tax officials at a cost of £11 million

The row over ‘middle-class’ child benefit cuts deepened last night, with claims the controversial Coalition changes will eat up more manpower than chasing millionaires avoiding their taxes.

Treasury Minister David Gauke has admitted more than 450 tax officials will be needed to implement the ‘high-income’ benefit cuts from next month at a cost of more than £11 million a year.

He also signalled no new staff were being taken on, prompting fears people have been diverted from other vital work within Revenue & Customs.

Last night, Labour seized on the figures, saying that even the Revenue’s affluence unit – set up to target wealthy individuals trying to evade or avoid tax – had only 300 staff.

They also contrasted the benefit cutbacks staff with the Revenue’s ‘offshore co-ordination unit’, which focuses on citizens who hide money offshore to avoid UK tax – claiming that it would only have 100 staff by 2015.

Rachel Reeves, the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘It’s shocking that HMRC is employing more staff to take money from  hard-working parents than it does to clamp down on offshore tax avoidance and evasion.’

A Treasury spokesman accused Labour of using ‘disingenuous’ figures: ‘They ignore the fact the Coalition is investing nearly £1 billion in HMRC  to combat evasion and aggressive avoidance.’

The benefit changes, which take effect on January 7, will affect around one million families.

Households with one person earning £50,000 or more will no longer receive full child benefit, worth £1,055 a year for one-child families.

But under the cutbacks, parents affected will keep receiving child benefit unless they notify HMRC by January 7 that they want to opt out. If they do not, any overpayment of child benefit  will be clawed back in extra tax.
