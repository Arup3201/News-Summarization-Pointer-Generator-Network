A student dressed up as a slave, with blood marks on his back as if he has been whipped, for Throwback Thursday in Loudoun County

Parents have spoken of their horror after a student dressed up a slave, daubing red stains on his back to look like he had been whipped for Throwback Thursday. 

The African American student had donned the costume for the tradition, which allows students to dress up in vintage outfits, at Loudoun County's Heritage High School in Leesburg. 

But parents were angry that he had been allowed to wear the slave costume for the whole day, NBC reported. 

A mother, who did not want to be identified, told the broadcaster: 'I was livid. I couldn't believe what I was hearing in 2015. Are you kidding me?'

As well as blood daubed on the back of a white shirt the student's costume included a message that said 'Property of Heritage High School.' He also carried a bag of cotton wool balls that he dropped throughout the campus.

The woman added: 'What if someone came dressed as the Holocaust or the Klan? Is that then considered inappropriate? Where is the line? You are dealing with teenagers.'  

Wayde Byard, spokesman for the school, claims the student was told his costume was 'tasteless' and 'really pushing the boundaries.' 

He said the teenager was told if someone complained he would need to remove the outfit and he was not allowed to take part in the competition. 

But he said they decided the costume did not break the dress code and he was allowed to exercise his right to free speech.

'There is a very fine line here between free speech and good taste. As we know, free speech is not always tasteful speech.' 

He also admitted had the student been white they may have been ordered to remove the costume because it could have created racial tensions. 

On a twitter feed that appears to belong to the student who wore the controversial costume, he said: 'This story made me look so bad, this isn't what I meant by this.'  Earlier, as news broke of the reaction to the outfit, he said: 'This is bad, very bad.' 

Loudoun County Heritage School said the costume was 'tasteless' but allowed the student to wear it 

In another post the teenager said: 'Yeah I just got grounded for all this.' 

The outfit provoked different comments on Twitter, with many of the teenager's friends praising him and other members of the public supporting free expression.

Matthew wrote: 'it's a great costume! I would have done the same thing. It's a free expression. It would be a great costume for Halloween.' 

Others supported the right to free speech, but some said it violated boundaries and needed a response from the school.
