More than 30 million  people are in work for  the first time in British  history after a further fall in unemployment was revealed yesterday.

David Cameron claimed that the Government’s economic plan ‘is working’ as unemployment fell by 99,000 in the three months to October, reducing the jobless rate from 7.6 per cent to 7.4 per cent, the lowest level since 2009.

There were drops in almost every region outside the South –  especially the West Midlands, the North West and the East.

The unemployment rate fell to 0.74 per cent in the three months to October, down 0.3 percentage points on May to July

However, if the trend continues and 
unemployment falls to 7 per cent, interest rates could be allowed to 
rise by the Bank of England from their current record low of 0.5 per 
cent.

Millions of 
homeowners would then see their monthly mortgage repayments start to 
rise, although experts believe this is unlikely to happen before 2015.

There are now 2.39 million out of work after the largest quarterly fall in more than a decade.

The
 number of people in work reached 30.09 million – an increase of 250,000
 over the quarter and of almost half a million compared with a year ago.

There were 30.09 million people in employment aged 16 and over, up 250,000 from May to July 2013 and up 485,000 from a year earlier

For the first time 10 per cent of over-65s are still in work, the Office for National Statistics said

A record 1.1 million pensioners are still working into retirement years, official figures showed yesterday.

With the employment rate jumping from 9.2 per cent a year ago to 10 per cent, this equates to another 109,000 OAP workers, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: ‘People are living longer, so many want to carry on working.

However rock-bottom annuity rates combined with low interest rates on savings mean that others have no choice but to carry on working because they cannot afford to retire.’

Mr
 Cameron said: ‘There should not be one ounce of complacency because we 
have still got work to do to get our country back to work, and everyone 
back in work means greater stability for them, greater ability to plan 
for their future, greater help for their families.

But the plan is working, let’s stick at it and get unemployment down even further.’

The
 number unemployed for more than 12 months fell by 33,000 to 866,000, 
the lowest rate for a year, while youth unemployment dipped by 19,000 to
 941,000.

And the 
number claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance fell by 36,700 in November to 
1.27 million, the thirteenth consecutive monthly reduction.

The Prime Minister told the Commons 1.2 million more people were in work than when the Coalition came to power in 2010.

But Labour leader Ed Miliband seized on figures showing a record 1.47 million were working part-time.

‘It’s
 good our economy is creating more jobs, but the problem is too many of 
them are part-time or low paid or insecure,’ he said.

He
 asked the Prime Minister: ‘Do you agree it is a matter of deep concern 
that at the end of this year average wages are £364 lower than they were
 a year ago and over £1,500 lower than they were at the general 
election?’

Mr Cameron 
replied: ‘I want to see more money in people’s pockets. The only way is 
to keep on with our economic plan, keep cutting unemployment, keep taxes
 down, cut the deficit so we keep interest rates down.’

The proportion of people working in the public sector has fallen to a new record, with most new jobs now in the private sector
