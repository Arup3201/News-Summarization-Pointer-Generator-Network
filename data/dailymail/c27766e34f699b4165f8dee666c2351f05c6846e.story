There must be consistency in sentencing for those found guilty of riot-related crimes, the country's former top prosecutor said today.

Youths who are found guilty of a crime should receive similar sentences to those found guilty of the same offence, otherwise It is 'just not justice'.

Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions in England and Wales, urged judges to avoid the 'moral panic' elsewhere in society when sentencing those involved in the riots and looting.

The statement came after the news a university student who stole three or four bottles of alcohol from a Tesco store during the
riots was handed a 16 month jail term.

Rioting: Sentences for similar offences shouldn't be wildly different

Lord Macdonald called on the Sentencing Council, who have not met since the riots, to issue new guideline 'as soon as it can feasibly do so'.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'I think it's important that the courts retain their objectivity, remain dispassionate and don't get swept up in any sort of moral panic that might be existing elsewhere in civil society.

'We shouldn't be finding ourselves in a situation where people are receiving wildly different sentences for offences that seem on the facts to be relatively similar. I mean that's just not justice.'

He added that within the riots and looting there was a range of offences being committed.

He explained that someone who was not
at the scene and received a small amount of low value property later 
was guilty of a far less serious offence than someone who smashed a shop
window, stole property and then set the place alight.

He said: 'I think those differences need to be clearly reflected in sentencing,'

Lord
Macdonald added that there was the risk of a 'collective loss of 
proportion', saying that some sentences look 'very severe' and 'appear 
out of kilter with each other'.

There has been criticism over the sentencing of Jordan Blackshaw, 20, and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan, 22, who were both jailed for for creating riot Facebook pages

A 16-year-old boy from west London, accused of murdering a pensioner during the riots in the capital, has been refused bail.

The boy appeared by videolink for a half-hour hearing at the Old Bailey so his counsel Abdullah Al-Yunusi could apply for bail.

But Judge Anthony Morris refused the application and remanded him in custody to a hearing at the same court on September 9

The youth, from Hounslow, west London, is also charged with violent disorder and four counts of burglary - relating to looting at a William Hill bookmakers, a Tesco Express, a Blockbusters video shop and a Fatboys restaurant.

He appeared at Croydon Magistrates' Court earlier this week with his mother, who was also remanded in custody accused of perverting justice by disposing of the boy's clothing

A man who looted a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop during the riots has been remanded in custody.

Thomas Downey, 48, was caught by riot police carrying a box of the snacks during the disturbances in Manchester, the court heard

Downey, of no fixed address, had been released from Strangeways prison 
at 7pm before traveling to the town centre for an Alcoholics' Anonymous 
meeting.

But by 1.30am, Manchester Crown court heard, he was drunk after drinking a bottle of sherry.

In mitigation, Zoe Nield told the court Downey left prison with just £4 in his pocket.

She said: 'He can't recall the events because he was drunk but he had expressed remorse.'

Downey is held in custody for sentencing on Thursday.

The pair were found guilty of 
inciting riots, which never actually happened,  and both received 
lengthy sentences of fours years.

The
judge justified the sentences saying the pair, who pleaded guilty and 
had no prior convictions, could have caused panic in their home towns.

Lord Macdonald said new guidelines should be put in place to address sentencing for the riots.

He
said: ''It would be a very good idea if the Sentencing Council could 
meet and issue some guidelines for sentencing in this area,'

'The whole point of guidelines is to achieve consistency and fairness.

'I think the council should issue guidelines as soon as it can feasibly do so.'

The Sentencing Council said it has not been asked by the Government to amend existing guidance to deal with future unrest.

Adding:
'Were we to receive such a request, it would be considered by the 
council at its next meeting in line with its normal processes.'

Conrad McGrath, 21, an student 
studying English at Aberystwyth University was handed a 16 month jail 
term for stealing alcohol during rioting on August

Harsh? Jordan Blackshaw, 20, (left) and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan, 22, were both sentenced to four years behind bars for inciting disorder via social networking sites

He
was spotted on CCTV squeezing through broken shutters of a Tesco 
Express and admitted taking 'three or four' bottles of an unknown 
alcohol.

He dropped the bottles when police arrived at the scene

Judge Robert Atherton told McGrath, 
who pleaded guilty to burglary at an earlier hearing: 'You followed the 
example of others by squeezing under the shutter and seeing what you 
could steal.'

The 
defendant, wearing a Aberystwyth University t-shirt, nodded to the bench
as Judge Atherton continued: 'You came into the city despite the advice
of friends and your mother.

'That was stupid and you should have known better.

'You are a student at university and you have thrown away a lot. It is a heavy price to pay for such behaviour.'
