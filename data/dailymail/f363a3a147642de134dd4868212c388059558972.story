For most men, shaving is nothing more than an insignificant part of their daily routine.

But for face transplant patient Ugur Acar, the simple act of removing his facial hair marks a defining moment in his progress.

These pictures show the moment the Turkish teenager was given his first shave at Akdeniz University's School of Medicine in Antalya since his successful operation to repair his face.

Defining moment: Turkish teenager Ugur Acar gets his first shave since his face transplant operation

Great job: Mr Acar admires his cleanly shave face after having his beard removed earlier this month

The 19-year-old had been forced to grow a beard in the weeks after the procedure, the first of its kind in the country, to avoid irritating the skin.

He was then freshly shaven for the first time two weeks ago - and was impressed with the result.

He gave a press conference to update media on his condition earlier this week and was due to stay in hospital for a further two or three weeks.

'I give thanks to all my doctors. It couldn't be better,' he said earlier this month.

Mr Acar said he hopes to get married one day.

Grateful: The 19-year-old thanked his doctors for repairing his face, which was badly burned in a house fire when he was a baby

However, doctors have warned him that he cannot make facial expressions for another six months.

Dr Omer Ozkan told him: 'Don't do any mimics as nerve healing will take six months.

'You will laugh, cry and get angry after six months, OK?'

Doctors successfully transplanted tissue from the face of a 45-year-old donor to Mr Acar.

On the mend: Mr Acar speaks to the media earlier this week. He is expected to remain in hospital for another two or three weeks before recovering at home

Israfil Kurtcepe, rector of the university hospital, said specialists will be at hand if he needs any support.

He said: 'Ugur was prepared for this process, and everything went well.

'He didn't need psychiatric or psychological care. We were just there for him to make sure that he didn't need any psychiatric assistance.

'We will continue to be there for him, and we will help him adopt his new life and talk with him about his personal problems, if there are any.'
