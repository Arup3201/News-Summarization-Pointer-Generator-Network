Opta can also provide data on 'long balls', a pass aimed for a pitch position or 2nd ball rather than a specific player. 

Manchester United have taken the long-ball route even more seriously under Louis van Gaal this season.

In stats provided by Opta, it shows that the Old Trafford side have attempted 1,696 long passes after 22 games this term - 358 more at the same stage last season under former boss David Moyes.

In fact, only Burnley - who spent around the £8million mark last summer as opposed to United's £150m spree - have attempted more long balls (1,737) in the top flight this season.

That comes as a surprising revelation considering Van Gaal has spoken in frustrated terms on various occasions when his team, in his words, have been forced to retreat to a long-ball game against sides who have used that tactic against them.

Following United's win against Harry Redknapp's QPR side earlier this month he said: 'In the first half we played like Queens Park Rangers and that's not good. 

'You have to play like we usually play with the ball on the floor.'

Most recently after the FA Cup stalemate against Cambridge he told MUTV: 'I was very disappointed at half-time because we made the same error against Yeovil Town and Queens Park Rangers.

'We played in the same style of play [as the opposition] and you don't have to do that.'

QPR, West Brom and Leicester are the other sides which make up the top five for attempting long balls this season.
