Half of the United States population resides in 146 very large urban and suburban counties clustered around the nation's most populous cities.

The remaining 157million Americans are scattered through the country's 3031 smaller counties, boroughs and parishes - many of them rural

Business Insider used U.S. Census data to point out the intriguing urban-rural divide and developed a map to illustrate the point.

The map shows not only where the large cities are located, but how large their suburban footprint is.

Population centers: This is the map that reveals the 146 counties that are home to half of the country's population

Densely-populated: In the northeast, the string of heavily-populated counties runs, almost uninterrupted, from northeast Massachusetts and Boston to northern Virginia and the Washington area. Southern California counties are dramatically larger, by comparison, but also include a similar string of unbroken suburban growth

The largest 146 counties range in population from Los Angeles County - with 9.8million people - to Williamson County, Texas, - a bedroom community for Austin, with 455,000 people.

The map offers one metric to show the suburban sprawl in the country that isn't always translated by examining city or metropolitan area population

For example, the Phoenix metro area is the 13th largest in the country. Maricopa County - where Phoenix is located - is the third largest in the nation.

With 3.8million people, Maricopa 
County is home to more souls than the entire city of Chicago and more 
than any single borough of New York City - including Manhattan.

It also shows that the footprint of many cities sprawls much farther than the city itself.

Miami is home to only 413,000. Dade County, though, is the 7th largest county in the nation, with 2.4million souls. 

Detroit,
 which has made headlines for its rapidly-declining population, still 
commands high density in its home - Wayne County - and two other 
suburban counties - Oakland and Macomb.

The 2010 U.S. Census reveals that American are increasingly clustering around large cities.

1. Los Angeles County, California -  9.8M

2. Cook County, Illinois - 5.2M

3. Harris County, Texas - 4.2M

4. Maricopa County, Arizona - 3.9M

5. San Diego County, California - 3.1M

6. Orange County, California - 3.1M

7. Miami-Dade County, Florida - 2.9M

8. Kings County, New York  - 2.5M

9. Dallas County, Texas - 2.4M

10. Queens County, New York - 2.3M

1. Loving County, Texas - 82

2. Kalawao County, Hawaii - 90

3. King County, Texas  - 286

4. Kenedy County, Texas - 416

5. Aurthur County, Nebraska - 460

6. Blaine County, Nebraska - 478

7. Petroleum County, Montana - 494

8. McPherson County, Nebraska - 539

9. Grant County, Nebraska - 614

10. Loup County, Nebraska - 632

About 80percent of the nation lives in settings that government defines as 'urban' - that includes areas that don't have high enough population to make the Business Insider list.

The U.S. Census data comes as a government report shows plummeting birth rates across the U.S. have finally leveled out after decreasing for the past four years.

The number of babies born last year, a little less than 4 million, is only a few hundred less than the number in 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released on Friday shows.

This suggests fewer couples are scared away from having children because of the economy or other factors, some experts say.

One, Brady Hamilton, a statistician with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said: 'We may be on level course or potentially even see a rise in birth trends in the near future.'

The report also showed that the birth rate for women in their early 30s has also increased for the first time since 2007.

Births were on the rise since the late 1990s and hit an all-time high of more than 4.3 million in 2007.

The drop that followed was widely attributed to the nation's flagging economy.

Experts believed that many women or couples who were out of work or had other money problems felt they couldn't afford to start or add to their family.

The economy was officially in a recession from December 2007 until June 2009, but polls showed most Americans remained gloomy, citing anemic hiring, a depressed housing market and other factors well into 2011.
