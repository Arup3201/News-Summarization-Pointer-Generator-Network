A one-bedroom flat with just one year left on its lease has sold for an astonishing £550,000. 

The property in London's Knightsbridge was down to the final 12 months of a 90-year-lease when its owner died recently. 

A flurry of interest saw initial offers of around £150,000 soar, with the new owner now having to try and negotiate a new lease, which could cost a further £2million.

A one-bedroom flat with just one year left on its lease has been sold for more than £500,000 in Knightsbridge 

The property previously had a 90-year lease which had not been renewed by the owner before they died recently

At 1,012 sq/ft, it comprises a large living room with balcony, bathroom, kitchen and double bedroom.  

But the new owners will have to spend another £2million if they want to purchase another 90-year-lease with freeholders The Wellcome Trust.

Nicholas Spencer, senior sales negotiator at Henry & James, described the sale as 'very rare' and fascinating'.

He said: 'Theoretically, every leasehold flat could be in this situation, however it is very rare that it happens and is becoming more unlikely by the day.

'People simply do not let their lease run this short.

'The sale of this flat demonstrated the perfect storm. It was a long lease that had run down to its last year, an eye watering extension premium, the freeholder’s right to serve notice for possession and the tragic and unexpected death of the owner, intestate.

'The flat itself is perfect. It is a prime location, first floor, unmodernised property with beautiful proportions and outside space. 

Flats in the area of the same size typically sell for around £3million, according to estate agents Henry & James

The 1,012 square/ft flat is a 'rare sale' say experts as so few people allow their lease to run so short 

The property is a stone's throw from Harrods in Knightsbridge in one of London's most exclusive areas 

The property comes with a balcony, small outdoor space, one bedroom, living room and bathroom 

The new owner will have to spend another £2million if they wish to renew the lease for 90-years, experts said

'It was fascinating to see how this unique sale played out.'

While Mr Spencer would not reveal any details about the new owner, it is thought they were aware of the investment potential for the flat when the sale was made.   

Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property expert, added: 'I haven’t come across a house selling with one year left on the lease.

'This is very unusual.'
