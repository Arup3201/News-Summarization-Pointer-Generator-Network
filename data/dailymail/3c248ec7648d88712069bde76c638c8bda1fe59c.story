A bizarre story of a young woman who was desperate to do her bit in Australia's war effort is just one of many stories being explored about the impact of war on Australian women.

Teenager Maud Butler from the Hunter Valley coalfields caused quite a stir in 1915 when she cut her hair, dressed as a soldier and stowed away on a troopship to Egypt.

ABC News reports, the adventurous life of 16 year old waitress, is being researched by historian Professor Victoria Haskins.

Maud had stowed away on the Suevic which sailed from Sydney on 23 December 1915, hoping to get to Egypt where her brother was serving. She arrived in Melbourne on 25 December 1915

As part of her study, Professor Haskins is researching Maud's expedition which includes her initial run in with authorities.

The teenager from Kurri Kurri, rural New South Wales climbed on board a troopship waiting at the Woolloomooloo docks in Sydney at night.

The clever young woman, who even looked the part, described how she got hold of an Australian Imperial Force uniform in bits and pieces and then had her portrait taken in it.

On the day before she stowed away she went down to Woolloomooloo Bay and that's when she saw a barber to have her hair cut short.

The next evening she headed back through the Domain to where the ship, Suevic, was lying at the wharf, a sentry on guard.

'Well, I said to myself, 'here goes for up the line'. It was a hand-over-hand job, and I didn't think the boats were so tall. I got up after a struggle and crawled to a lifeboat,' she told reporters from the Farmer and Settler.

It's believed she was close to getting away with it but it was her boots that gave it away and the 16 year old was discovered by a suspicious officer two days later out at sea, who asked for identification.

'That was the trouble all through. I bought the tunic and breeches from a soldier and the putties in George Street and the cap in Bathurst Street.'

'But I could get no regulation tan boots that I could wear. I tried everywhere, but it was of no use. So I had to chance it', reported ABC News.

The officer, who hadn't worked out she was female, was going to let Maud stay but apon the request of a doctor's examination, she was forced to confess.

She was then told by the captain she was going to put on the next passing passenger liner back home.

'Then I cried for the first time; it was hard luck, wasn't it, now'? Maud was reported as saying.

Maud who was described as a 'rosy-cheeked,  healthy country girl' gave reporters an interview a few days after her return to Melbourne on Christmas Day, 1915.

She told them that she 'had a terrible desire to help in some way'. 

With opportunities little, she also told of how in Sydney she had tried to join the Red Cross, without success.

It's believed there were already hundreds of young women, both trained nurses and Red Cross voluntary aides, waiting to get the front.

Studying Maud's extraordinary exploits, Professor Haskins has received a grant to explore the impact of the war on Australian women.

'The way I am approaching it is to reconstruct as much as possible the personal stories of individual women, like Maud Butler, whose stories can shed light on what it was like for women during the war from various backgrounds', she said.
