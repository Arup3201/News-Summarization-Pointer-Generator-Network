Tiny twin babies born just a week before the legal abortion limit have made a full recovery, despite doctors warning their parents to expect the worst.

Nichola Baird, 30, from Hebburn in Tyne and Wear, gave birth to twin boys Kyle and Jake  last September.

The boys arrived just 23 weeks into the pregnancy, and were barely the size of a hand.

The current legal limit in the UK for an abortion is 24 weeks with research showing babies born before this time rarely survive.

Kyle and Jake French were born prematurely, one week before the legal abortion limit of 24 weeks

Mrs Nichola Baird, 30, and husband Colin, 42, were told to expect the worse when their sons Kyle and Jake were born 16 weeks early

But the twins were born weighing a little over 1lb each - the equivalent of a bag of sugar.

The average baby weighs about 7.5lb at birth.

The twins were born at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead, Newcastle but had to be taken to critical care units where specialists worked to save the tiny brothers' lives.

But due to bed shortages the twins had to be separated and were sent to separate hospitals.

Kyle, born at 1lb 7oz, was taken to the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough, while his brother Jake, born at 1lb 6oz, was bound for Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI).  

Mrs Baird was also taken to the RVI to undergo an emergency blood transfusion after losing so much blood.

She only got to see Kyle when he was two-weeks-old, with partner Colin, 42, splitting his time to make sure he visited both his sons.

Kyle and Jake required operations to close  valves in their tiny hears, which are closed in babies born full-term. Kyle also needed a major operation on his bowel

Mrs Baird said she went into a 'complete panic' when she realised she was going into labour so early

On countless occasions before and after the birth, the couple were told to prepare for the worst because the twins' premature birth had led to a series of complications.

Both boys underwent emergency heart surgery to close   valves, while Kyle also needed a major operation on his bowel.

Mrs Baird, a sales manager, said she was 'terrified' when she realised she was going into labour weeks before she was due.

She said: 'I went into a complete panic when I realised I was going into labour so early.

'I'm quite an organised person so to have this thrown on me caught me off guard.

'We were told to expect the worst because the babies were born so prematurely.

'The doctors said before I gave birth that babies are classed as not viable until 24 weeks so prepare yourselves for bad news.

'I felt as though they were being treated like foetuses.

'Not being able to hold your children when they are born was the worst feeling, we couldn't even touch them at first because their skin was so weak.'

Mr and Mrs Baird, who have been together for four years, were overjoyed when they were told at their 12 week scan that they were expecting twins.

Mrs Baird said it was 'extra special' when she and her husband were allowed to cuddle their sons for the first time. She said: 'They are a miracle. Looking back now, I realise how lucky we all were'

But the joy turned to fear when, just three weeks after their 20-week scan, their baby boys arrived 16 weeks early.

Mrs Baird was told that Jake would need major surgery on his bowel and had to be fitted with a stoma bag to collect his waste, at just 13 days old.

Things got worse as both babies then underwent an emergency operation at 25 days old to close their heart valves, which usually shut in the womb.

Mrs Baird said: 'Doctors gave Kyle a 50/50 chance to even survive the operation and all we could do was pray and cling on to every ounce of hope we had.

'It was never an option for us to consider what would happen if we lost them.

'We took it day by day and hour by hour.

'Afterwards, they were both left really poorly from the operations and not knowing what was going to happen was awful.

'But when I held them both for the first time, it was extra special because I had waited for so long to give them a cuddle.'

After  17 weeks in hospital, the boys were finally allowed home.

Jake was discharged on his original due date, January 12, and Kyle followed a week later.

The boys were born so early they were barely the size of a hand and weighed just over 1lb, the equivalent of a bag of sugar. They now weigh just over 18 pounds and aside from routine oxygen checks they are healthy

Mrs Baird says she feels lucky that her children are alive and thanks Royal Victoria Infirmary - one of the hospitals where the boys were treated - for their help

The pair now both weigh just over 18 pounds and aside from routine oxygen checks made by a community nurse, they are living normal lives.

Mrs Baird said she feels extremely grateful her children are alive and thanked the hospitals for their help.

She said 'They are a miracle. Looking back now, I realise how lucky we all were.

'We could have not got through the past months without the help of the Tiny Lives charity at the RVI in Newcastle.

'They gave us the support and guidance we needed when Colin and I were at our lowest, they were incredible.'
