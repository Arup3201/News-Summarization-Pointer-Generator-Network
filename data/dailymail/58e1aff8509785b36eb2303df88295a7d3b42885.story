President Obama has revealed that his older daughter Malia has gone through the teenage rite of passage by attending her first prom.

He wouldn't say whether she had a date or went with friends, joking that it was 'classified information'.

The President opened up about his daughters and how fast they are growing up during an interview that aired on Live! With Kelly and Michael this morning.

Obama says it was 'a little bit jarring' 
to see his 15-year-old 10th grader in heels for the first time, before 
adding that Malia looked beautiful.

Speaking generally about the prospect of his daughters beginning to date, he said that he doesn't think he'd been too intimidating for any boy who might roll up to the White House to pick Malia up.

The president says he and the first lady were worried that growing up in the White House would give their daughters 'an attitude' but proudly boasted that they have remained respectful, kind and considerate young women.

That result, he said, is a result of Mrs Obama's maternal instincts.

'I'm labor, she's management,' he joked about their parental roles.

'(Michelle)'s a brilliant lawyer and was a very strong professional and smart as can be when it comes to policy... but what drives her and she's passionate about is children.'

One thing he did say that his wife won't undertake is a political career of her own.

When asked by Kelly what he would say if Michelle turned to him in 10 years and said that she wanted to run for office, the President said: 'I would say where did you take my wife because I was sure there was an alien body-snatching going on.'

'One thing I can promise you is Michelle will not run for office.'

In the rapid fire round of questions at the end of the taped interview, President Obama admitted to being an intense trash talker during the basketball games he hosts at the White House, but also credits the playful banter as the reason why he feels his opponents don't just let him win.

'They will tell you that they don't let me win because I trash talk so much that it's not worth it,' he said.

'When they hit me and knock me down they get nervous.'

The most damaging incident came when the President was accidentally hit in the face with another player's elbow, sending Obama to the White House doctor to receive 12 stitches on his lip.

'He just swung around and whacked me,' the President said of the player, without revealing his name.

'I'm not sure the got invited back but I did send him a picture' of the cut, he said, with a note that read 'you're the only man who ever got away with cold clocking the President'.

The interview was timed to coincide with his Thursday announcement of a push for further study on youth concussions.
