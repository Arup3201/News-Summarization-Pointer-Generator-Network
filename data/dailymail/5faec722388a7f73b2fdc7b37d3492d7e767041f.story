Researchers tackling the illegal trafficking of desert chameleons are using barcode scanners like those used in supermarkets to police trade.

Unique ID microchips are being fitted to the six-inch long Namaqua chameleons in the Namib desert so their movements can be tracked.

The chameleons can now be read just like a supermarket barcode when a researcher waves a scanner over them.

British photographers Ann and Steve Toon, from Tarset, Northumberland, documented the unique project while on a trip to Namibia in west Africa.

A global trade supplying chameleons as pets and to collections exists with around 60,000 animals legally exported from their home countries each year.

But customs officials trying to show a chameleon is being illegally exported have found proof difficult to come by.

This is why chameleon expert Dr Krystal Tolley, of Cape Town's South African National Biodiversity Institute, is fitting the implants with Tommy Collard, a natural history guide in Namibia.

Dr Tolley says the new chips cause no harm to the wild creatures and hopes it will deter the theft of Namaqua chameleons.

She said: 'We are inserting a tiny metal piece encoded with a barcode with a syringe just under the skin.

'The chip itself is actually called a Passive Integrated Transponder tag.

'We haven't seen any side-effects. The skin is sterilised before the tag is inserted, and it's a very small piece, a few millimetres.

'It would be like having a biggish splinter. The small hole is then covered with spray-on skin glue, the stuff you get in pharmacies.'

The Namaqua is found in arid parts of Angola, Namibia and South Africa.

The chameleons spend much of their time on the ground or clambering onto sparse, scattered shrubs

Unlike most of the world's 160 species of chameleon, the chameleons spend much of their time on the ground or clambering onto sparse, scattered shrubs.

They have the typical chameleon features of well-developed legs, large, grasping feet, a prehensile tail and mobile, independently-moving eyes on the ends of 'turrets'.

But its most striking characteristic is the row of large, knobbly tubercles running along a ridge on its back, giving it a zigzag outline reminiscent of a small dragon or dinosaur.

The chameleons have a surprising turn of speed when required - but with so little ground cover, it isn't particularly difficult for poachers to locate and catch them.

As a result, policing illegal trade is difficult and traders often falsely declare that chameleons for sale are the descendants of legally-imported specimens.

Unless they can be caught in the act of smuggling, the onus is on the authorities to prove the animals have in fact been taken from the wild.

But this is where microchipping could prove invaluable.

Dr Tolley said: 'We do know that some Namaqua chameleons were shipped to Europe under 'permits' issued by Uganda.

'But this was just a ruse, because this species doesn't occur in Uganda, so they have no right to ship or issue these.'

Dr Tolley hopes the microchipping initiative will also stop valuable data about the behaviour of these little-studied creatures.

The barcodes could track long term changes in growth, size and weight.

The researchers will also track the movement of adults and juveniles of both sexes.

Little of this information exists currently so they hope the data reveals plenty of information about how the species lives.

Barcoding could also determine what sort of range size they need, their survival rates and even population size.
