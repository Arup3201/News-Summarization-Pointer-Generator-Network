Minnesota Vikings' star running back Adrian Peterson has sparked anger - after appearing to compare his child abuse charges to the situation unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri. 

Peterson, who was arrested in September for disciplining his son, four, by striking him with a wooden switch, took to Twitter after a grand jury decided not to indict police officer Darren Wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed Michael Brown. 

As the city descended into chaos, the 29-year-old told followers: 'The GRAND JURY DECIDED NOT TO INDICT ME TOO! But that changed a week LATER! MAYBE,BUT NOT LIKELY N THIS CASE' before adding, '#PUTyourTrustNGODnotINtheWORLD!'.

The remarks prompted a backlash from Twitter users with one writing, 'This is gonna get taken down real quick by your PR guy'.

Twitter user Michael G. Money said: 'Shhh not the same thing just let it ride'. Another wrote: 'Now is not a good time'.

Peterson pleaded no contest in a Texas courtroom to a misdemeanor assault charge following his arrest and was told to pay a $4,000 (£2,550) fine and perform community service.  

The child, who has not been named, was left with cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles, according to court records.

He was later suspended without pay for at least the remainder of the 2014 NFL season.

Shortly after his Tweet today, he posted another message which said: 'Others may misunderstand my good intentions, judge my words or deeds, find fault in what they truly do not understand. 

'But God Knows my heart. He knows I am learning, trying.'

The star running back posted a further Tweet a short time later after an earlier one had sparked outrage

The 29-year-old then followed it up with yet another Tweet an hour later

He followed it up with yet another Tweet an hour later, which said: 'MY HEART GOES OUT TO MIKE BROWN'S FAMILY! MY THOUGHTS & PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU! #PRAYING4PEACE.'

Ferguson descended into lawlessness, chaos and fire overnight as violent looters ran riot after a grand jury decided not to indict police Officer Darren Wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed Michael Brown.

Violence flared after the decision was announced by St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch at around 8:25pm on Monday evening, and continued throughout the evening and into early Tuesday morning.

President Barack Obama and the family of Michael Brown asked for calm. 

Angry crowds took to the streets around the Ferguson Police headquarters after the grand jury determined there was no probable cause to charge Wilson with any crime for the shooting of 18-year-old Brown this past summer.
