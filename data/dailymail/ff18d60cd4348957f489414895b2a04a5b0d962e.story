They are calling him the Mag Slayer in Sunderland now.

Scoring goals in Tyne-Wear derby victories affords you a lifetime of acclaim in these parts – do it three times and you’re talking freedom of the city.

Adam Johnson – Sunderland-born and a boyhood fan – will never have to buy a drink in town again.

Former Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi has long since been known as the Mackem Slayer. He scored seven times against the Black Cats and only Newcastle legend Jackie Milburn, with 11, has more derby goals.

Johnson, though, is writing his own piece of red-and-white history.

He volleyed the only goal in the last minute of Sunday’s contest to add to the pair he bagged in the 3-0 triumphs of the past two seasons on Tyneside.

Johnson was also part of the team which won 2-1 at the Stadium of Light last October and only he, John O’Shea and Seb Larsson have appeared in each of the history-making four straight victories over the Magpies.

So how is he enjoying his new nickname?

‘Yeah, three wins, three goals - it's great for me,’ he said.

‘I didn't know that Shola was called that to be honest. But this is a great highlight for me.

‘It's brilliant to be part of the first Sunderland team to win four in a row. We have created history. We are the team that did it. I am not sure how many more times that will happen.

‘Since I signed I have won four and drawn one. St James’ Park has been a good ground for us in recent years and for me personally it has been very good.’

It wasn’t always that way. Johnson was a 13-year-old fan when Don Hutchison and Niall Quinn scored in a 2-1 victory at St James’ in 2000.

By the time he was 25 they hadn’t won since. That changed when he was on target with a delightful curler from range in April, 2013 and his predatory prod 10 months later made it back-to-back wins at Gallowgate.

Then, on Sunday, he started and finished the breakaway which cemented his name in the fixture’s 116-year history.

‘I was a fan in those days when we couldn’t win there,’ he said. ‘But we have started a new era of our own now and it feels great.

‘For the goal Moussa Sissoko was having a go at me and then Paul Dummett tried to scissor me after I had turned Sissoko. But if you stay on your feet then you get rewarded and to go on from there and get the winner proves that.

‘When everybody jumped on me at the final whistle it was probably up there with the best feelings I have had in football.

‘To have scored the winner, in the last minute, in front of the Gallowgate End for Sunderland can never be taken away from me now.’

And no-one will ever try to take that away from him - rather, Adam Johnson the Mag Slayer might have to get used to his new nickname.
