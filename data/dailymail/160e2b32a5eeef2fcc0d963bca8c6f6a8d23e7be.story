The daughter of actress Natalie Wood has been arrested on suspicion of possessing cocaine and heroin after police were called to reports of a gunshot at her Malibu home.

Courtney Wagner, 38, was involved in a furious row with a man last Sunday when a gun went off, it was alleged today.

Neighbours called police after claiming they heard a woman screaming and the weapon discharge.

When officers arrived, they found Wagner in possession of cocaine and heroin, law enforcement sources told TMZ.

She was held on suspicion of felony drug possession. The man was arrested for the alleged negligent discharge of a firearm.

It is not believed anyone was injured in the incident.

According to an article on TMZ.com, Courtney has since posted $10,000 bail, although it is not known whether the man is still custody.

Wagner is the daughter of late actress Wood and her husband, actor Robert Wagner.

Natalie Wood drowned in mysterious 
circumstances sometime after the evening of November 28, 1981, when the 
43-year-old actress was boating off Catalina Island with Robert Wagner 
and actor Christopher Walken.

Heated argument: Courtney Wagner, pictured with her father Robert Wagner in 2007, was reportedly involved in a screaming row when neighbours heard a weapon discharge

Wagner - a former jewellery designer - was just seven years old when her mother died.

Speaking in a 2004 interview, she recounted her memory of the tragedy and coping with the aftermath.

She said: 'I don't remember very much about my mother. I do remember her laugh and 
the way she smelt, and I remember her hands - things like that that made
me feel close to her.

'(After her death) My father and I
and my sisters started travelling a lot. We went to Switzerland and 
spent a lot of time there, which I think was important.

'I think that 
everything Dad did then - like not being around this crazed atmosphere 
in LA with the paparazzi - was a good idea.

It brought us all closer 
together. And I always had compassion and respect for him for keeping 
the family together - it could easily have fallen apart.'

The mysterious nature of Natalie Wood's death prompted claims she was the victim of homicide.

Just last year Los Angeles police re-opened their investigation into her death, citing 'substantial new evidence' led them to re-open their investigation into 
her death.

But in January they announced that there was nothing to suggest foul play and ruled the death an accident.

The evening before the drowning, Wood, 
Wagner and Walken, who was Wood's co-star in the film 'Brainstorm,' had 
dinner at a restaurant on the island.

According to ship Captain Dennis 
Davernâ€™s sworn statement to detectives, the trio returned to the yacht 
and had drinks and Wagner and Walken got into an argument.

A furious Robert Wagner shouted 'Do 
you want to f*** my wife' at Walken as he smashed a bottle of wine in 
the moments before Natalie Wood fell overboard, Mr Davern claimed.

The captain told the officers when he
showed up on the open deck where Woods and Wagner had been arguing, Mr 
Davern said 'Wagner was present, and he stood near the far rear wall of 
the yacht.'

Wagner has always maintained Wood 
accidentally slipped and drowned as she drunkenly tried to tie up a 
dinghy against the boat. Police say he is not considered a suspect.

Chief detective William McSweeney said in January that cold cases like Wood's are never really 
closed and that detectives are still looking at some aspects of the 
case.
