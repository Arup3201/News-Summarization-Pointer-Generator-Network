Seeing just one waterspout is thought by many to be a once-in-a-lifetime event, but one lucky boat passenger managed to capture four in these amazing pictures.

Italian Roberto Giudici managed to take the pictures while sailing off the Greek Island of Orthoni, in the Ionian Sea, when a huge storm blew up over night.

The morning light then revealed this stunning scene of the four waterspouts, which develop in a similar way to tornadoes but are usually far weaker.

Waterspouts: Roberto Giudici captured these pictures while sailing off the Greek Island of Orthoni, in the Ionian Sea

The pictures were taken in 1999 but have only come to light after they appeared on a NASA website.

Mr Giudici, who now lives in Rennes, France, said: 'We were about a mile away from the nearest one, I asked the captain if they were dangerous as we were heading towards them.

'He looked at me and made a gesture, but he seemed to be hopeful.

'I observed this sight over the Adriatic Sea on a boat trip to Brindisi, Italy. As we departed, the weather was very summer-like with some humidity, hot and sunny.

'Cumuliform clouds developed during our excursion, but the weather didn't appear threatening. In fact, the atmospheric pressure was stable at 1,024 millibars.

Photographer: Roberto Giudici said the boat he was on actually passed through the funnels as it continued on its journey

'Suddenly, we saw a line of funnel clouds straight in front of our boat. The photo shows the most recently formed waterspout in the foreground; the oldest spout, in the background, would disappear in a few seconds.'

Mr Giudici however said these were not the only waterspouts he saw while on the boat.

He said: 'I could count at least 10 on the starboard and some on the port side and they lasted for about four minutes each.

'The photo shows actually the first waterspout as being the youngest and the latter very thin and the oldest, ready to disappear.

'Our boat actually passed through the scary funnels. The spouts were spaced about a third of a nautical mile from each other.

'This is obviously an old picture and is not even digital but I have been asked recently if it is a fake, which it is not, it has now been used on the website Earth Science, part of NASA's Earth Science Division.'

Waterspouts form at focused points over the warmer sea-water where condensation builds between the water and cloud, which contains cool, moist air.

The spouts do not pull water into the sky, they remain just above the sea forming clouds which form into twisting coils.

Nasa's Jim Foster said he believed the photograph was real.

He said: 'Waterspouts having multiple funnels, while not often photographed, occur more often than do tornadoes that have multiple funnels.

'It seems that the convective cloud systems that lead to waterspout formation, which have relatively weak circulation fields compared to tornadoes, can support more but much smaller funnels.'

Waterspouts form in a similar way to tornadoes but are often weaker than their land counterparts.

The spouts do not suck up water but instead remain just above the sea forming clouds which form into twisting coils.

The water comes from condensation building up between the warm sea-water and the cloud which contains cool, moist air.

Stronger versions can occur from mesocyclones - which are a vortex of air within a convective storm.

While waterspouts often form in the tropics they have been spotted in other areas including Europe, New Zealand, the Great Lakes and Antarctica.
