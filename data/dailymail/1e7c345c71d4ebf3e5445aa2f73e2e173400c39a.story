A multimillionaire investment banker who chose to expose details about the sordid affair that ended his marriage in a bid to avoid paying a $1.3 million debt now stands accused of stealing from his children's trust fund.

Manhattan-based Hugh Levey, 65, 'has perpetrated frauds upon various individuals and entities — the most spectacular and malicious of which was on his own wife, Wendy Levey, and even his children,' claims his ex in a new lawsuit.

'His pillaging was so extreme that he even depleted his children's trust funds', according to the filing in Manhattan Supreme Court.

Spurned wife: Wendy Levey has accused her banker husband Hugh of withdrawing more than $130,000 from his children's trust funds plus raiding $10 million from her own personal family trusts

Submitted records show that Hugh withdrew more than $130,000 from the trusts between 2001 and 2003, reports the New York Post.

He is also accused of raiding $10 million from his ex-wife's own personal family trusts. 

Last month a Manhattan Supreme Court judge ruled that Hugh must pay up the $1.3 million he owes to a Virginia investment firm called Pensmore after he lost the money in a bad investment.

Hugh had engaged in a drawn-out court battle to avoid paying during which he willingly made public documents about his 12-year affair with business partner and TV talking head Claire Gruppo.

However, instead of stumping up the cash, he used documents about his highly confidential net-worth statement, which was part of his divorce from his wife of 40 years Wendy Levy.

The paperwork showed that while Levey, who has a Harvard MBA, is cash poor, with $500 in a checking account, $200 cash on hand and no savings, he was worth $29 million.

His funds are invested in a $15 million Fifth Avenue apartment, a $5 million Greenwich home and millions in various trusts and personal items.

Yet the millionaire 'deliberately keeps himself cash poor in order to avoid judgments, a trick he learned in a personal bankruptcy in the 1990s,' the Pensmore suit said.

Meanwhile, despite being the co-founder of Gruppo, Levey & Co. he relies on his mistress, Gruppo, 61, to give him spending money.

Pensmore is now suing Levey to force the sale of $2 million in antiques, art and jewelry listed on his net worth statement to pay off the debt.

Wendy is trying to block the move, saying the personal property Hugh was ordered to auction off is her jewelry, art and antiques.
