A humanitarian worker on holiday in New York was charged $165 (£106.60) by a pedicab driver for a journey of just 0.8 miles in Midtown on New Year's Eve.

Haiti-based Red Cross employee Ken Smith, 41, was in New York with his wife Peothong and daughter Samantha, who both took the pricey ride with him from Herald Square to the Rockefeller Center.

The Wisconsin native, who has travelled throughout Asia and Africa, said the driver charged per passenger, which is illegal, and covered a sign with prices printed on it with his foot.

The visitor told the New York Post that he could have taken a helicopter ride for the price charged by the driver of the bicycle-powered vehicle.

He said: 'I felt like I was robbed.

'We saw and know most of the scams all over the planet, and, sadly, we're victims to one in our own country.'

Mr Smith reported the incident to the non-emergency 311 line.

While this ripoff was significant, Mr Smith and his family are not the first to be scammed by a New York pedicab rider.

In June 2013 a Japanese couple was reportedly charged $720 for ride from Midtown to Greenwich Village which took 20 minutes. The rider used the Square mobile card-reading app to take the fare.

With tourist scams becoming a major issue in New York a new law was passed in 2013 in an attempt to regulate fares. 

Pedicabs must display their per-minute rate on their vehicle after laws were changed in 2013

The new rules state pedicabs can only charge a per-minute rate rather than a fee based on distance or the number of passengers. 

The driver can charge whatever they like as long as it is posted on their vehicle in 28-point font. 

There are more than 800 pedicabs operating in New York, concentrated mostly around major tourist attractions such as Central Park and Times Square.
