Turkey threatened the France with retaliation after a controversial bill to make it a crime to deny the mass murder of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks moved a step closer to becoming law.

Fury: Turkish press branded Sarkozy Satan as relations between the two countries become more strained

Turkey sees the allegations of genocide in 1915 as the Ottoman Empire imploded as a threat to its national honour, insisting estimates of the scale of the killing is exaggerated.

And the country reacted furiously when France's parliament approved the legislation on Monday.

Sarkozy, whose party supported the bill, is now expected to sign the bill into law by February.

Turkish press headlines slammed Sarkozy: ‘(He) massacred democracy,’ read the banner headline of the leading Hurriyet newspaper while the Sozcu daily blasted ‘Sarkozy the Satan.’

The law has also risked more sanctions from Turkey and is complicating an already delicate relationship with the rising power.

Turkey has already suspended military, economic and political ties, and briefly recalled its ambassador last month when the lower house of parliament approved the same bill.

Support: President Sarkozy's signature making the controversial bill law is considered a formality

Turkey's Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the decision, saying the law should not be finalized to ‘avoid this being recorded as part of France's political, legal and moral mistakes.’

If the law is signed, ‘we will not hesitate to implement, as we deem appropriate, the measures that we have considered in advance,’ Turkey's Foreign Ministry said. It did not elaborate on the measures.

Armenians believe about 1.5 million 
Christian Armenians were killed in what is now eastern Turkey during the
First World War and this was part of a deliberate policy of genocide 
ordered by the Ottoman Turk government.

The majority of Turks argue that 
there was a heavy loss of life on both sides during the fighting in the 
area, and that mass killing was inevitable result of newly 
industrialised warfare.

The debate surrounding the measure comes in the highly charged run-up to France's presidential elections this spring, and critics have called the move a ploy by Sarkozy to garner the votes of the some 500,000 Armenians who live in France.

‘It is further unfortunate that the historical ... relations between the Republic of Turkey and France have been sacrificed to considerations of political agenda,’ Turkey said. ‘It is quite clear where the responsibility for this lies.’

Officials in Sarkozy's conservative government were in damage-control mode on Tuesday, appealing to Turkey's government to keep its calm.

‘As foreign minister, I think this initiative was a bit inopportune. But the parliament has thus decided. What I'd like to do today is call on our Turkish friends to keep their composure,’ Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Canal Plus TV.

‘After this wave that has been a little bit excessive, I have to say I'm convinced that we will return to constructive relations - I extend my hand, I hope it will be taken one day.’

France's relations with Turkey are already strained, in large part because Sarkozy opposes Turkey's entry into the European Union.

The law is likely to further sour relations with a NATO member that is playing an increasingly important role in the international community's response to the violence in Syria, the standoff over Iran's nuclear program and peace negotiations in the Middle East.

The Senate voted 127 to 86 to pass the bill late Monday. Twenty-four abstained. The measure sets a punishment of up to one year in prison and a fine of €45,000 for those who deny or ‘outrageously minimize’ the killings.

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan slammed the French parliament bill as 'discriminatory and racist'

For some in France, the bill is part of a tradition of legislation in some European countries, born of the agonies of the Holocaust, that criminalizes the denial of genocides. Denying the Holocaust is already a punishable crime in France.

Most historians contend that the 1915 killings of 1.5 million Armenians as the Ottoman Empire broke up was the 20th century's first genocide, and several European countries recognize the massacres as such.

Switzerland has convicted people of racism for denying the genocide.

But Turkey says that there was no systematic campaign to kill Armenians and that many Turks also died during the chaotic disintegration of the empire. It also says that death toll is inflated.

Some Turks said Turkey should retaliate in kind. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused the French of ‘genocide’ during France's 132-year colonial rule in Algeria.

‘I think our country should have retaliated in the same way after the French Bill has passed,’ Yilmaz Sesen, a chemist, told AP television in Ankara. ‘They have committed genocide in North Africa, and not too long ago either.’
