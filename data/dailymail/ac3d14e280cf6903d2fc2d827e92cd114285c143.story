Twenty eight Alabama counties have stopped issuing all marriage licenses rather than comply with a federal court order to legalize same-sex unions. 

Now 3.1million people - straight and gay alike - are caught in a tug of war between US District Judge Callie Granade and Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, who has said told counties not to comply with the federal ruling.

By Wednesday, only 23 of the state's 63 counties were issuing licenses to same-sex couples. That leaves two-thirds of the state refusing to follow Judge Granade's order. 

Sixteen counties are issuing marriage licences to only straight couples.

Just 23 of the 63 counties in Alabama have opted to obey a federal judge's ruling and begin issuing marriage licenses to gay couples

One study in 2013 suggested that just 2.8percent of Alabama's population is gay, lesbian or transgender. 

In Mobile, on Tuesday 51-year-old James Strawser and  38-year-old John Humphrey sat outside the marriage license window at the county courthouse - protesting the fact that local officials refused to open it and give them - or anyone else - a marriage license. 

'Come on, you've got a federal order. Open those windows,' Strawser said, to no avail. 

Strawser and Humphrey filed one of the lawsuits for the right to marry in Alabama. 

US District Judge Callie Granade's order overturning Alabama's same-sex marriage ban took effect Monday. Granade has been on the court since 2002 after she was appointed by President George W Bush. 

Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore on Sunday night ordered the state's probate judges to not issue the licenses, arguing that probate judges were not bound by Granade's decision since they were not defendants in the lawsuit that led to the order.

President Barack Obama, in an interview with BuzzFeed News, was asked about Moore's resistance and the comparisons some have made to Alabama Governor George Wallace's efforts to fight integration 50 years ago.

'I won't say it's a perfect analogy, but there's a core principle here that's at stake, which is we have a supremacy clause in our Constitution,' Obama said.

'My recollection is that Judge Moore had a similar problem with a federal court ruling that you couldn't put a huge ... Ten Commandments statue in the middle of your courthouse and, ultimately, federal law was obeyed and I think that the same thing will end up happening here,' Obama said.

Granade on January 23 ruled that the state's marriage ban was unconstitutional in a case brought by two women seeking to have their California marriage recognized by Alabama. She struck a second blow to the law on January 26 in the case brought by Humphrey and Strawser, who were seeking to get married.

At least 19 of the state's 67 counties had issued wedding licenses to same-sex couples or said Tuesday they would do so, compared to just seven on Monday. The exact number of counties refusing to sell licenses wasn't immediately clear.

Elmore County Probate Judge John E. Enslen said in a statement Tuesday that 'the dust has quickly settled' and it was clear same-sex marriages were allowed.

'Whether national or not, it now applies to Alabama,' he said.

Limestone County Probate Judge Charles Woodruff began issuing same-sex licenses Tuesday after seeking legal advice because of the conflicting opinions. 'I wasn't sure what the law was,' Woodruff said. 'I have never received an order from the chief justice of the Supreme Court in an email before.'

Robert Povilat, 60, and Milton Persinger, 47, were among the couples waiting in Mobile for a second day on Tuesday. They said they would return every day until they were able to get a marriage license there.

'We sat and waited all day for them to open a window,' Povilat said. 'They never did.'

Mobile County Probate Judge Don Davis said he closed the marriage-license section of his office because of 'conflicting orders' from Moore and Granade. Davis said he will keep the section closed until he gets additional clarification, which could come Thursday.

Granade has scheduled a hearing after Strawser and Humphrey asked the court to force Mobile County to issue same-sex marriage licenses. A second lawsuit filed by other couples against the Mobile County probate judge also names Moore as a defendant.

Strawser said he hoped the Thursday hearing would settle the issue, once and for all.

The case in Mobile only seeks to force that county's judge to issue the licenses. However, a lawyer for Strawser and Humphrey said she hoped Granade's decision would be 'instructive' to the other probate judges.
