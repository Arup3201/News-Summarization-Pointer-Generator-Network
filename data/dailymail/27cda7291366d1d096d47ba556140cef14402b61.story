To date the most populated planetary system that we know of is that around the sun-like star HD 10180, which is thought to have nine planets in total.

The planets, however, are inhospitable to life as we know it, ranging from hot super-Earths to gas giants bigger than Neptune.

But could there exist a system with many, many more planets than this – with dozens of them habitable? That’s what one astronomer has calculated, and he says it’s theoretically possible a system could exist with 60 worlds life could exist on.

Astronomer Dr Sean Raymond has devised an 'ultimate solar system' (shown) that could have as many as 60 habitable worlds. To create the theoretical model he considered the stars, planets and orbits that would be required to allow as many Earth-like worlds as possible to exist

Dr Sean Raymond, an astronomer at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux in Bordeaux, France has revealed how to build a so-called ‘ultimate solar system’ at PlanetPlanet.

His self-appointed task was to build a planetary system with the most habitable worlds possible that could survive for billions of years.

To do so he considered the kind of star that would be needed, the types of planets and the logistics of the orbits.

‘With the ultimate Solar System I wanted to come up with a fun idea to get people thinking about this stuff,’ Raymond tells MailOnline in an email.

‘And everyone is interested in astronomy and planets so it's a fun way to use your imagination. 

‘I don't claim to have the absolute best answer.  Still, with just these relatively simple pieces it's easy to build a very rich system!’

In choosing a star Raymond opted for one about half the size and mass of the sun at the hotter end of the ‘red dwarf’ spectrum.

This, he says, would create a system that will survive longer than our own with a fairly tight habitable zone, the area around a star within which it is neither too hot nor too cold for water, and possibly life, to form.

Next he considered what types of planets would create the most hospitable environments in a packed planetary system.

‘We want planets that are not too small, big, dry or wet,’ he writes.

‘We want planets with atmospheres, surfaces, oceans and continents.

‘This translates to worlds between about half and twice the size of Earth, with between ten times less and ten times more water than Earth.’

The first of the two planetary systems that would fit into Raymond's final design would have 24 habitable worlds. These would each be binary Earths in trojan orbits (ones that trail another) around their central star, a red dwarf smaller and slightly less hot than the sun

To date Nasa has found many potentially habitable worlds outside the solar system, but most have been so-called super-Earths that are much larger than our own world. The habitability of these planets is not well understood but, if they reside in the habitable zone of their host star, it is possible they could have liquid water

The Goldilocks zone, or habitable zone, is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal 
for liquid water to
pool on a planet's surface.

To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits.

They can calculate this by knowing the size and type of the star.

They can then estimate a region where it might not be too hot or too cold for water to form.

The final step was to find suitable orbits for the planets to inhabit.

Raymond says there are two possible configurations for a solar system packed with habitable planets.

This first is one that includes multiple binary planets, two Earth-sized planets orbiting one another as they orbit their sun.

Within the habitable zone of the star specified earlier, Raymond envisages six orbital bands, with two binary planet systems per orbit.

Each pair of systems would be known as a ‘trojan’ pair, which means one trails the other in the orbit.

In our solar system there are what are known as trojan asteroids, which trail the orbit of Jupiter.

In total this system would therefore have 24 habitable worlds. Some of these worlds would have different amounts of water and different sizes to each other but Raymond says they would all be habitable.

In the second configuration he considers a system that not only has binary planets, but gas giant planets with Earth-sized moons in orbit as well.

This is similar to our own solar system, where Jupiter has four large moons approaching the size of Earth and Saturn has one.

In such a system, to remain gravitationally stable, there would be four orbital bands.

On each would be two binary systems and one gas giant with five Earth-sized moons in orbit, again with trojan orbits.

This system would have a grand total of 36 habitable worlds.

The other component system of Raymond's ultimate solar system would have, in addition to binary planets, four gas giants each with five Earth-sized moons in orbit. In this model Raymond says there would be a total of 36 habitable worlds which, when combined with the other system, gives a total of 60

The discovery of Kepler-186f, the first Earth-sized world to be found orbiting in the habitable zone of a star, was announced back in April. This world is the best bet so far for a planet that could not only support water on its surface but life as well in some form

Raymond then says that if the two systems were in a binary star system separate by about 100 AU (100 times the Earth-sun distance), it would create the ultimate solar system with 60 habitable planets.

‘The ultimate solar system is scientifically valid,’ Raymond continues to MailOnline.

‘Each piece has either been directly observed or has been inferred from theoretical work. 

‘For example, the Earth-moon and Pluto-Charon systems are planets with nearly equal-sized moons.

‘We know of plenty of planets in the habitable zones of their host stars. 

‘And computer simulations tell us that trojan configurations might be common in planetary systems, and that large moons may form readily around giant planets (although exactly how large is debated).

But, Raymond concedes, the chances of such a system are slim, although not non-existant.

‘Packing so many habitable worlds into one system may be a bit of a stretch.

‘Having all of these pieces in the same system in the right combination is probably not all that common.’

He also says there could be theoretical systems with more than 60 habitable worlds, but for now his model is the most scientifically viable.

And he says it is possible a solar system could have up to 60 Earths

To create the model he considered the types of star, planet and orbit

The total system would be two binary stars with two planetary systems

One would have 36 habitable planets and the other would have 24

Such a system is not likely to be common but could exist, says Raymond
