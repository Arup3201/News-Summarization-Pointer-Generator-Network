A rare picture of Charles Miller, the British gentleman who arrived in Brazil in 1894 with a football under each arm and introduced the country to the sport

It is a scene almost impossible to imagine today for reasons Scottish football fans will readily understand.

A Scotsman arrives in a Brazilian port with a football under each arm, attracting quizzical looks from the locals who wonder what the spherical objects are for.

The Scot demonstrates with a flash of his skills on the ball and the Brazilians gape in awe at the wizardry on display.

Today, as Brazilian fans eagerly anticipate their country’s bid for a sixth World Cup win – this time on home soil – there is little any country, far less Scotland, can teach them about football.

But 120 years ago, this is  essentially how the world’s greatest football nation discovered the sport.

The man who stepped off the boat in Santos in 1894 was Charles Miller, son of a Greenock boatyard clerk who had left his home town to build a new life in South America.

Coincidentally, he began playing the game in Sao Paulo at the same time another Scot, Glasgow-born factory worker Thomas Donohoe, was helping to popularise it in Rio de Janeiro.

A statue was unveiled there last year to honour Donohoe’s role but historians now agree Miller was the first to organise a match played under Association Football rules in Brazil.

And, far-fetched as it may seem, it is even suggested 5ft 5in Miller’s dribbling and passing style became the blueprint for the Brazilians’ trademark mode of play.

He was too short to be any real threat in the air – but his trick of flicking the ball over his head with the back of the heel is still known in Brazil as ‘chaleira’, derived from the Scotsman’s name.

Miller’s father had left his job in Greenock to strike out on his own in Brazil in the 1860s. By the time he met and married Charlotte Fox, daughter of the richest Englishman in town, he had already landed a job as a high-powered railway engineer.

His son Charles was sent to a boarding school, Banister Court in Southampton, for a ‘proper English’ education, and it was there he first kicked a football.

On the 
pitch, Miller earned the nickname Nipper for his deftness on the ball 
and eye for goal and, at 17, he was spotted by the local St Mary’s side,
 which later became Southampton FC.

He then joined Corinthian, the legendary London amateur club, which boasted some of the best players in the world.

When Miller finished school at age 19, he had scored a remarkable 45 goals in 34 matches in his latest season and was widely expected to turn professional.

But it seemed he had a higher calling in South America.

Miller was amazed to find football was practically unknown in Brazil. The British expat community’s pastime of choice was cricket, apparently much better suited to the tropical heat.

But he did not see it that way. He waited until autumn, when the cricket bats had been put away, and seized his chance.

On April 14, 1895, on a scrubby field on the floodplains of a river in central Sao Paulo – after some cattle were moved out of the way – Miller played in the first full football match on Brazilian soil.

‘What a nice little game,’ he said later of the encounter. His Sao Paulo Railway side beat the Gas Works team comfortably by 4-2.

The Brazilian fans watched bemused as first the rudiments then the subtleties of the game were presented to them.

They seemed to get it. One local journalist was on the right lines when he wrote: ‘It gives them great satisfaction or fills them with great sorrow when this kind of yellowish bladder enters a rectangle formed by wooden posts.’

In 1901, the country’s first league was founded in Sao Paulo and at its conclusion Miller’s Sao Paulo Athletic Club – a team of expats – and Paulistano, made up entirely of Brazilians, were tied.

Son of a Scottish dad and an English mum, Charlies Miller was born in Sao Paulo less than 10 miles from the new Itaquerao Stadium

They met in a play-off for the title. After Paulistano drew first blood, Miller scored twice to lift – and drink champagne from – the first ever championship cup.

Miller was also behind rival cities Sao Paulo and Rio meeting up for the first time. But the biggest  victor of all was football.

What began in Brazil as a game for the white elite and impeccably dressed supporters who greeted every goal with cries of ‘hip hip hurray’ became a game for the masses.

Before long, the sight of children kicking anything spherical around the streets was ubiquitous.

They were infused with the rhythm, individualism and playfulness still evident in Brazilian football with stars such as Pele becoming household names.

There is no doubt about the significance of Miller’s contribution to Brazilian football. By the time of his death in 1953, Brazil had hosted its first World Cup.

‘Few have captured the imagination of an entire nation like he did,’ said a news-paper obituary.
