Call it an improvement in international relations, or simple result of the high levels of emotions and passion at the World Cup, but it seems many of the thousands of fans who have descended on Brazil are interested in scoring off the pitch as well as on.

Tinder, the dating app made famous by its ‘swipe’ – right for ‘yes I’m interested’ and left for 'no' - has reported a massive 50 per cent rise in usage in the country since the start of the tournament.

Whether fans are looking for comfort after their team loses or to celebrate a victory, they are turning to Tinder in droves in the hope of ‘matching’ with another like minded fan.

The thousands of fans in Brazil has resulted in a surge in use of the dating app

Tinder spokesperson Rosette Pambakian told Quartz, who reported the rise in usage: 'The average user spends more than one hour a day on Tinder, approximately 77 minutes, and that number is up by nearly 50 per cent in Brazil since the start of the World Cup.'

The location-based app, which only shows you people in your current vicinity, was already popular in Brazil, with usage there falling just below the UK.

It uses information from the other social media giant Facebook and allows users to make their decision on each person anonymously, opening a separate window where two user to chat only if they have both swiped right for each other.

Unsurprisingly female fans are attracting almost as much attention as the football itself

Looking at the crowds at the World Cup, it is hardly surprising that many, spurred by the excitement of the football, are feeling amorous in Brazil.

Battling the baking heat in Rio, the female fans are enjoying plenty of attention for their skimpy – but very patriotic - outfits, complete with colourful wigs, team scarfs and plenty of face paint.

With such hot high jinx going it's no wonder there's a bit more than footie going on in Brazil this summer.
