Ronnie O'Sullivan retained his Champion of Champions title in Coventry by seeing off Judd Trump in a high-class battle.

The five-time world champion looked to be cruising at 8-3 ahead before Trump roared back to 8-7 in the first-to-10 contest at the Ricoh Arena.

But O'Sullivan had enough about him to get to the line first and take a 10-7 win and a £100,000 cheque.

Ronnie O'Sullivan has a taste for victory and retained his Champion of Champions title against Judd Trump

Judd Trump didnt go down without a fight, but it was O'Sullivan who emerged victorious in Coventry 

Age is serving to make O'Sullivan better, with the Essex man, who turns 39 next month, retaining the consistency that so often eluded him in his early days.

His numbers against Trump were simply stunning, compiling breaks of 137, 78, 80, 87, 134, 139, 70, 70 and 109, but a rot-stopping 63 to go out to 9-7 proved to be the most valuable.

Trump - who made 102 and 100 himself - was rampant at that point but O'Sullivan gave himself a chance with the knock made without use of the blue or black. Even then Trump was not done and had a chance to clear on the colours to force a re-spot but went in-off the green.

Trump decided he had nothing to lose after that and took on a long red at the start of the 17th. He got nowhere near and O'Sullivan slammed in a fourth century of the match and a seventh of the week. Four of the top five breaks also have his name next to them.

The 38-year-old has been working on reigniting his passion for the sport with psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters

O'Sullivan has rediscovered the scintillating form he regularly showed in the early stages of his career 

'I just played as well as I could,' O'Sullivan told ITV4 afterwards.

'I would like to say well done to Judd as he had a great tournament. He pots so well and doesn't get worried that I didn't know what to do today.'

The revival of O'Sullivan's career is charted back to him starting working with renowned psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters.

Since the two teamed up, O'Sullivan has rekindled a previously-absent passion for a sport in which he is considered to be the greatest of all time.

'If I'd have lost I'd have said the same thing, you can't ask for more than that and you want to keep playing,' he added.

'I was happy to be involved in one of the best matches you'll see.

Speaking openly with ITV4 O'Sullivan admitted that his work with Dr Peters helped him get back to his best

'I was playing like this when I was 15, 16 and then I played rubbish for 16 years but I hung in because I'm stubborn. Since I've been working with Steve Peters I have found the form I was always capable of.

'I'm enjoying it, I hope it lasts, but when it ends, it ends.'

Trump admitted there was little he could do to stop the force of O'Sullivan.

'I take a lot of positives because the way Ronnie played is the best anyone has played. I marvelled at him making it look so easy and that's one of the best performances I've seen from anyone in any sport.'
