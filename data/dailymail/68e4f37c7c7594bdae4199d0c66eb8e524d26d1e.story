Two photographers hid in the nearby bushes and took the pictures which were published by some online media outlets.

Upset: Croatia players, including Real Madrid star Luka Modric, are refusing to speak to media after pictures emerged of them bathing nude at the team's hotel in Brazil

Angry: Croatia boss Niko Kovac hit out over the intrusive images that appeared on some media outlets

'I can't force them to be at your disposal after what you have done to them and their families,' angry Croatia boss Niko Kovac told reporters in the team's Praia do Forte training base.

'How would you feel if someone took naked pictures of you? They are adamant that they won't speak to you lot anymore and I don't know whether the silence will end tomorrow or last until the end of our World Cup campaign.

Looking ahead: Croatia will hope Mario Mandzukic will return to action when they take on Cameroon in Manaus on Tuesday

'I respect my players' opinion and I also know that you have done a very professional job so far but you blew it with this one. The whole world has seen the photos.'

Croatia play Cameroon in the hot and humid Amazon city of Manaus on Wednesday in what is a must-win game for both sides after the Croatians lost their opening Group A match to hosts Brazil 3-1 while the West Africans were beaten 1-0 by Mexico.
