When one is the monarch, one is used to being given a comfy seat in the front row.

But yesterday the Queen found herself perched several rows back as she watched the Commonwealth Games swimming heats.

She was given an ordinary plastic seat and then found her view obscured by a woman in a rather large hat.

The offending spectator was her own lady-in-waiting, the Hon Annabel Whitehead, who made matters worse by having chosen a very similar shade of green in which to dress.

Queen Elizabeth II spent most of her time at the Commonwealth Games swimming races trying to see over her lady-in-waiting's enormous hat

Her Majesty, who had been visibly enjoying herself at the hockey earlier that day, appeared to be finding it difficult to see what was going on over the head of the Hon. Annabel Whitehead

At one point, the Queen looked somewhat dejected as she sat back in her chair glumly, left. After a while, she appeared to be giving up trying to get a better angle, right

Queen Elizabeth II spent most of her afternoon trying to improve her view - which was somewhat obscured by her lady-in-waiting's enormous green hat.

As the swimming races got off to an exciting start below, she could be seen craning her neck to try and get a better view over Mrs Whitehead.

The Queen began to look dejected as she dodged around her lady-in-waiting to catch a glimpse of the heats of the men's 50m and women's 100m butterfly.

At one point, she even appeared to sit back in exasperation, as fellow spectators around her got heavily involved in the races.

The view was made difficult by her lady-in-waiting The Hon. Annabel Alice Hoyer Whitehead, who was wearing a similar - but slightly clashing - green ensemble to the Queen

The pictures were a far cry from the Queen's expressions as she watched the hockey earlier that day.

During that game, she had been seen laughing and joking with fellow spectators and getting wrapped up in the drama of the game.

But it seemed the Queen was too polite to ask her lady-in-waiting to move - and instead spent her time dodging around Dame Whitehead as she moved position.

Dame Whitehead, 71, had already risked royal disapproval by wearing a green ensemble similar to the Queen's - which actually appeared to clash.

Meanwhile, the Queen wore a green 
crepe coat by Karl Ludwig, a floral silk dress and a blue hat with green
 trim by Angela Kelly.

She also sported a thistle brooch, one of a set of four pins gifted to her by the Sultan of Oman.

The Queen looked fed up as she failed to see down to the pool and get involved in the excitement of the races

At one point, as everyone looked animated around her, the Queen appeared to look exasperated with her lack of view. She was there to watch the men's 50m and women's 100m butterfly heats

Dame Whitehead has been on the royal 
lady-in-waiting circuit for some time, having been the temporary 
lady-in-waiting to HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon 
between 1971 and 1975.

She was then an extra lady-in-waiting to HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon between 1975 and 1992 before becoming a Lieutenant of Royal Victorian Order (LVO) in 1986.

She was again lady-in-waiting to HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon between 1992 and 2002, before becoming lady-in-waiting to the Queen.

The Queen expectantly took her seat as a spectator at the Commonwealth Games, but seemed to struggle settling into the plastic chair - something in which she is not particularly well-practised

It was a far cry from pictures taken earlier in the day, in which the Queen seemed to be having a great time as 
she shared a joke with fellow spectators at the England versus Wales 
hockey game

Her majesty appeared to follow the England hockey team's struggles with fierce intensity

In 2002, she was invested as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) before becoming a Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (DCVO) in 2014.

At the swimming centre, the Queen was 
introduced to volunteers by Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond and 
Glasgow 2014 chief executive David Grevemberg.

Aquatics competition manager Helen Jacques was left in stitches when The Queen expressed her amazement at the swimmers.

The
 30-year-old Londoner, who sat next to the Queen, said: 'The Queen did 
say something funny - "They swim quite fast, don't they? It's very 
close". I said "Yes, yes, this is the nature of the sport".'
