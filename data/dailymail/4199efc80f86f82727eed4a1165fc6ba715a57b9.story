She's never been one to shy away from making a bold sartorial statement and the welcoming ceremony on Horseguard's Parade for the president of South Korea was no exception for Theresa May.

The Home Secretary, 57, looked cheerful in her brightly patterned coat as she strolled towards the ceremony with a thoroughly upstaged David Cameron and William Hague.

The coat, which made its first appearance during a House of Commons speech in 2011, was teamed with a pair of stylish patent over-the-knee boots, black leather gloves, a black clutch bag and a patriotic red poppy pin.

But there was one person at Horseguard's Parade that Mrs May couldn't completely overshadow - the Queen, who was resplendent in an elegant pink wool and silk dress and coat by Karl Ludwig and a matching hat by Angela Kelly.

By contrast, Park Geun-Hye, the first female president of South Korea, plumped for an elegantly minimal ensemble comprised of a navy coat and grey trousers accessorised with a diamond brooch.

Mrs May is famous for her penchant for fashion and love of colour, although not every look has proved entirely successful.

Most recently, she made headlines when she appeared at the Conservative Party conference in a daring tartan suit by Vivienne Westwood which she teamed with a pair of £215 Russell and Bromley flats.

She is also well-known for her love of leopard print and famously wore a pair of print kitten heels to the 2002 conference.

So well-known has Mrs May's style become, she's even inspired her own tongue-in-cheek blog entitled Fashion Moments With Theresa May.

And Theresa May isn't the only Conservative MP to mix style and a high-flying political career.

During her tenure as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher was famous for her distinctive style which usually included a pussy-bow blouse, her trademark pearl necklace and a ladylike bag.

Other female politicians known for their grasp of fashion include former French Justice Minister Rachida Dati, Laura Chinchilla, the first female president of Costa Rica, and Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt.

Patent leather might have spent the past few seasons in the fashion wilderness but this season, it's back with a vengeance as Mrs May knows all too well.

She teamed her colourful coat with a knee-length pair of patent boots, taking an easy route into a trend that isn't always the easiest to wear.

But while patent boots offer an easy way to pack a particularly fashionable punch, there are plenty of alternatives around for those who prefer shoes without the shine.

The patent leather pencil skirt has proven particularly popular among fashion mavens, with Rihanna, Leigh Lezark and fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson among those adopting it.

Spotted on the catwalk at Versace, Altuzarra and Salvatore Ferragamo among others, patent isn't for the faint-hearted but looks set to stick around well into next Spring.
