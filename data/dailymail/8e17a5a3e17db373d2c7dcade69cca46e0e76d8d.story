For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read.

In his new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - Redknapp reveals the ways in which the Premier League radically changed English football.

When we first heard about the Premier League, we all thought it was just a change of name. Division One was now going to be called the Premier League - but what a load of rubbish that turned out to be.

Once the new league started in 1992, everything about our game changed.

It became about foreign players, foreign coaches and foreign wages to keep up with the biggest clubs in Europe.

An influx of foreigners, like Paolo di Canio (right), ensured that British managers changed their ways

The days of walking in, shouting and screaming and throwing teacups at players were gone. There is no point effing and blinding at a player who can hardly speak English.

You had to talk to them, slowly, reasonably. An awful lot of British coaches ruled by fear and bullying, and the foreign players wouldn’t accept that. They weren’t used to being talked to like that, being embarrassed or humiliated in front of their team-mates.

The whole dynamic of English football has altered. During one of their rows, Roy Keane accused Sir Alex Ferguson of having changed.

Alex’s response was: ‘Of course I’ve changed. How could I have survived this long if I hadn’t changed?’

He’s right, of course. We’ve all had to change to deal with the demands of modern football.

It’s not just that players have agents, it’s that those agents sometimes have a better line of communication to the chairman than the manager. And it’s not just that the players know who the chairman is - it is that they are on first-name terms and think nothing of putting in a call if they are unhappy with anything from team selection to training.

What certainly altered was the way you tried to build team spirit. The old methods were very simple - bonding sessions, getting the lads to go out for a drink or have a day at the races.

Everybody laughs, falls about, gets into a few scrapes. A typical jolly boys’ outing, but the foreign players didn’t want to know about that.

I can remember during my time at Tottenham I took the lads to the Cheltenham races. I thought we’d have some fun, relax together, come back a bit tighter as a unit - but you would have thought I’d taken them on a prison visit.

About eight of them were looking at their watches after half an hour. What are we doing here? Why have you brought us here?

Roman Pavlyuchenko never moved out of his seat all day. Just sat there, waiting for the time to get on the coach and go home. Wouldn’t watch a race, wouldn’t have a bet, just not interested in joining in.

In the end, it has been the English footballers who have had to change because at most clubs now they are isolated. It is a different life for them now.

I remember Paolo Di Canio brought his fitness coach to West Ham. The food at the training ground changed, too.

Lunches at Chadwell Heath had barely altered since my day - steak and kidney pie, loads of potatoes, anything you could get. By the end of that first season with Paolo’s man, everyone had their own tailored, balanced food intake and a special dietician supervised that regime.

My best team for this period includes possibly the most controversial selection of my whole book: Matt Le Tissier instead of David Beckham. I know some people will think I’ve gone mad. But David was a fantastic player in a fantastic team, whereas Matt was performing heroics that built a football club.

Without him, Southampton couldn’t have stayed in the top division for so long, and without that they would not have been able to build their new stadium and its fabulous academy that saw players like Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott come through the ranks.

Le Tissier’s 10 greatest goals would stand alongside those by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo -even Diego Maradona or Pele. He was a one-man band there for a lot of the time, like Sir Tom Finney had been at Preston.

People would ask ‘Why isn’t he playing for Manchester United then?’ He was just happy to be at a club he had known since he was 16, happy to be 30 minutes away from his family in the Channel Islands.

I think he would have been brilliant at a club like Arsenal, but just because he didn’t make that jump doesn’t mean he’s not smart.

Patrick Vieira was a different type of midfield player and one every club would like to take now. He almost came to me at Tottenham from Inter Milan.

I thought it was an incredible decision by him, after he’d been such a hero at Arsenal.

I met him at his house in Hampstead and he had no fear about what people would think or what reception he would get. He had enough confidence in his ability to just brush it away.

I remember talking to Daniel Levy, our chairman, about him. He said the crowd would be hostile. I knew that - but if he had enough bottle to want to put on our white shirt after all that had gone before, I thought it said something about the man.

In the end, his circumstances changed and he decided to stay in Italy. By the time he did become available - the following January - our needs had changed and Manchester City snapped him up.

Patrick is the player Arsenal have never really replaced, but I still find it bizarre that he ended up in a blazer at Manchester City. Shouldn’t he be at Arsenal?

It is ironic that so many associate Arsene Wenger with the beautiful game, yet his Arsenal teams, with Vieira - the ultimate box-to-box midfielder - did as much as anybody to introduce real physical power into the modern Premier League.

Teams got bigger to compete with Arsenal because they were so strong. They were up there with any of the great post-War teams - the Busby Babes, Tottenham’s Double winners, Revie’s Leeds United, the great Liverpool teams, Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson - they deserve to be mentioned with any of them.
