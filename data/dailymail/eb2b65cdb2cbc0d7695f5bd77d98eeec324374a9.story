It has swept the globe dominating social media and now the ice bucket challenge has reached the animated realm - with a shirtless Homer Simpson taking the plunge. 

Producers of The Simpsons have released a clip of the loveable character being doused in icy water before the stunt spectacularly backfires.

Homer nominates Ned Flanders, drinking buddy Lenny and real estate mogul Donald Trump before trying to take the easy way out by pouring a small glass of icy water over his head.

Homer Simpson is the latest in a line of celebrities to take the plunge in the ice bucket challenge

But a curtain of water then knocks him to the ground, quickly followed by penguins, a polar bear, ice hockey players, a Yeti and an ice cream truck.

No prizes for guessing who is responsible.

A pan upwards reveals Bart cackling in a helicopter having just dropped the load on his father.

'Fight ALS', Homer says to the camera before passing out.

The ice bucket challenge began in late July when former Boston baseball player and ALS sufferer Pete Frates dared his friends to perform the task to raise awareness.

It subsequently went viral, with millions of challenge videos posted to social media accounts and a sharp rise in donations.

Many celebrities including Robert Downey Jr, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise, Patrick Stewart, Jennifer Lopez, Will Smith and George W. Bush have now taken part.

Everyone who takes the challenge makes a donation to the ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) Foundation, which heads the fight against Lou Gehrig's.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.

The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death.

When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost.

Early symptoms can include:
