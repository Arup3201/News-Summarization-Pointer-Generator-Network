A charity is under investigation after a British father-of-three allegedly used one of its aid convoys to travel to Syria and carry out a suicide bombing.

Children in Deen, based in Yardley, Birmingham, has admitted that Abdul Waheed Majeed travelled to the war-torn country with the charity in July last year.

He is believed to have later died after driving a truck packed with explosives into the wall of Aleppo prison - killing dozens of civilians and allowing hundreds of inmates to escape.

It is thought that the 41-year-old, from Crawley, West Sussex, was the first ever Briton to carry out a suicide attack in Syria.

Now, regulators at Charity Commission are investigating Children in Deen's decision to allow Majeed to join its aid convoy.

A
 commission spokesman said: 'We are aware that the registered charity, 
Children in Deen, was involved in an aid convoy to Syria in July last 
year.

'We are currently 
assessing whether there are any regulatory concerns arising from this, 
and recent media coverage in relation to this.'

During the attack at Aleppo prison on February 6, Majeed is believed to have driven an armoured dumper truck into the facility's wall.

The vehicle was draped in the flags of Jabhat al-Nusra - an extremist faction aligned to al-Qaeda and banned in Britain.

In a video later released by the group, Majeed can be seen laughing, smiling and pointing at the sky moments before he is believed to have carried out the suicide attack.

Today, Children in Deen trustee Sara 
Rathore said that between five and 10 charities were involved in two 
overseas aid convoys it sent to Syria in March and July last year.

The July convoy included 148 individuals - one of whom was Majeed, she confirmed.

'Children
 in Deen is a legitimate charity and the convoy was fully legitimate,' 
she said. 'We provided details of the individuals travelling to the 
authorities before departure.

'Some of those on the list were told they
 could not go for various reasons unrelated to terror suspicions. But 
Majeed clearly was not one of those flagged up.'

She
 added that the charity, which works in Syria, Gaza, and Pakistan, 
continues to send aid to Syria - but now does so in shipping containers.

Concern: Last month, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was deeply concerned at the threat posed by returning British jihadists

'It is more cost-effective to send aid over in containers, and takes less manpower,' she said.

Children
 in Deen, which means 'faith' in Arabic, supports three projects in 
Syria - a school, a bread factory and a women's project providing 
employment support.

On its website, it states it is 'dedicated to improving the lives of deprived children in third world countries and help break the cycle of poverty.'

It adds: 'We also provide emergency aid to disaster hit areas around the world.'

Last month, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was deeply concerned at the threat posed by returning British jihadists.

‘We have not changed the policy,’ he said. ‘We are concerned about the number of British people going to Syria for humanitarian reasons or to get involved in the war that is happening.

‘There are a few hundred people going out there.

They may be injured or killed, but our biggest worry is when they return they are radicalised, they may be militarised, they may have a network of people that train them to use weapons.’

The Charity Commission has now opened two separate statutory inquiries into aid organisations to Syria.

The commission said in August that it was monitoring Aid Convoy and an affiliated organisation called Syria Aid.
