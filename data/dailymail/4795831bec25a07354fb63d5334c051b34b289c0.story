A California woman who was arrested last year for allegedly disrupting a city council meeting by continuously clapping now says her constitutional rights were violated when she was taken into custody.

Letitia Pepper, an attorney and longtime critic of the local government in Riverside, has filed a lawsuit in federal court over the June 25, 2013, incident.

Pepper was handcuffed and removed from the city council meeting, but she was never actually charged with a crime.

Disruptive: Letitia Pepper was taken into custody for being disruptive during a city council meeting last year

In February, a spokesman for the Riverside County District Attorney's Office said no charges would be filed against the woman 'based on a lack of sufficient evidence,' the Riverside Press Enterprise reports.

Pepper's arrest came after she and other members of the audience during that particular meeting began applauding for speakers with whom they agreed.

The town's mayor, William 'Rusty' Bailey warned the audience - and Pepper specifically - to not applaud for speakers because it could dissuade others with opposing views from speaking out. 

Pepper's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and named the city, Mayor Bailey, City Attorney Greg Priamos and police Chief Sergio Diaz as defendants.

'The city of Riverside seeks to provide an environment at City Council 
meetings where free speech rights are respected and where everyone can 
feel comfortable expressing their views,' Bailey wrote in statement delivered to the newspaper through a spokesman

The mayor added that rules of conduct during city meetings are meant to 'ensure that the business of the City can be 
carried out efficiently and without unnecessary disruptions.'

Applause: Pepper and others were continuously clapping for speakers after the mayor warned her not to

Pepper, who the local paper describes as an 'activist' who has run for both mayor and for a spot on the City Council, says that the clapping by her and others was done only as speakers were done speaking, and it in no way was disrupting anyone or keeping anyone from speaking out.

On Thursday, Pepper said she felt she needed to sue 'because these guys are doing things that are illegal and they’re not 
going to stop doing it. ...What happened to me was totally wrong.'

Constitutional law expert and Dean of the University of California at Irvine Law School Erwin Chemerinsky  told the paper the city has the right to develop its own rules for its meetings. However, those rules can't violate the First Amendment to the Constitution.

'So long as the City Council ... can do its work, there’s no basis for stopping the expression,' Chemerinsky said.
