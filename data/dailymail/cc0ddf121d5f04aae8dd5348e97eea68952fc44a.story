The Shadow Chancellor said Labour would attempt to introduce the tax as soon as they took power if elected

Labour is to seek to introduce its mansion tax on expensive homes from day one of regaining power, Ed Balls suggested last night.

The shadow Chancellor said he hoped to hit better-off homeowners in the 2015-16 financial year, even though that starts a month before the May general election.

It is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, but Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough into the NHS as quickly as possible.

The coalition sought to undermine Mr Balls’s pledge to £2.5bn for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £3bn boost at the autumn statement. 

Critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next Parliament.

But Mr Balls, in an interview with the Independent, said: ‘Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.’

Mr Balls has asked the Treasury to start preparations for such a tax before the election.

The Shadow Chancellor denied this would amount to retrospective legislation.

‘A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. We will be clear what we are going to do in our manifesto. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,’ he insisted.

‘I am sure that the Treasury will be gearing up to make sure we can deliver this.’

If unable to impose the tax that early, Mr Balls said Labour would will legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year, 2016-17, ‘as a backstop’.

Labour’s mansion tax will be about £3,000 a year for homes in the £2m to £3m bracket, with far higher annual charges running into tens of thousands of pounds for more expensive properties.

The proposal has been criticised by most of the Labour MPs in the running to be the next Mayor of London, given the capital will bear the brunt of the tax.

Critics warned Labour would not be able to see the revenues from such changes so quickly after the election

The Conservatives have branded it a ‘homes tax’ and predict it will quickly be extended to cover cheaper properties to raise the forecast revenues.

Chancellor George Osborne dramatically increased stamp duty on properties worth more than £1m in the autumn statement, meaning those buying the most expensive homes face a double whammy if Labour wins power and applies an annual mansion tax on top.

The timing of Mr Balls’ announcement is aimed at out-manoeuvring claims the revenue from a mansion tax would not start flowing soon enough - jeopardising Labour’s pledge to spend £2.5bn more on the NHS than the Conservatives.

The rest of the increase in spending would come from a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds.
