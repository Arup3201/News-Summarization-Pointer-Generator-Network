Northampton will defend their serial miscreant Dylan Hartley at an RFU disciplinary hearing on Tuesday following his red card for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith.

Hartley has been banned four times in his career and another suspension could have dire consequences for his international career.

Northampton were left fuming by referee JP Doyle’s decision to send their captain off, with injured prop Alex Corbisiero claiming on television that Smith ‘deserved an Oscar’ after Hartley’s elbow caught him square on the nose following a brief grapple between the pair.

April 2007: Banned for 26 weeks after gouging Wasps’ James Haskell and Jonny O’Connor.

March 2010: Claims of gouging versus Scotland dropped when alleged victim, Ross Ford, chose not to complain.

March 2012: Banned for eight weeks for biting Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris during Six Nations Test.

June 2012: Sin-binned against South Africa in first game as England captain.

December 2012: Given a two-week ban for striking Ulster’s Rory Best.

May 2013: Eleven-week ban after being sent off for swearing.

December 2014: Sent off for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith.

Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder added: ‘The red card was disappointing. Dylan’s got to keep his arms down but he was being held. I don’t think there was any malice in it. In the nature of the game I don’t think it justified a red.

‘I think Smith went down easily, which was disappointing. It’s a tough game and Dylan plays to the edge. You won’t change him.’ 

England coach Stuart Lancaster was understood to have been incensed by Hartley’s yellow card during last month’s Test against South Africa and read the riot act to the hooker before dropping him to the bench against Samoa. 

It remains to be seen how he views Hartley’s latest indiscretion.

Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘If you strike someone in the face you are liable to get yourself in trouble. You would have thought he might have learned by now.’

Hartley’s moment of madness overshadowed a magnificent performance by Northampton who shrugged off the inconvenience of playing for 64 minutes with 14 men to beat their rivals courtesy of Jamie Elliott’s 77th-minute try.

Centre Luther Burrell was named man of the match, while locks Courtney Lawes and Christian Day also impressed as Northampton stayed top of the Aviva Premiership table.

‘We got what we deserved,’ Cockerill said. ‘Defensively we were poor and they outplayed us in the second half.’
