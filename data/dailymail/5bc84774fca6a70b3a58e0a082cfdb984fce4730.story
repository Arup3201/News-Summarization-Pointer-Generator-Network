A premature baby was found dead in his cot after becoming dangerously dehydrated because doctors allegedly failed to tell his parents how to properly tube feed him, an inquest has heard.

Ben Claydon, who was born at 26 weeks with a range of health problems, had been hooked up to a feeding tube at home to receive proteins and nutrients.

However, his parents claim his doctors failed to tell them that they also needed to give him water.

Ben Claydon, who was born at 26 weeks with a range of health problems, died of dehydration after doctors at Southend Hospital (pictured) allegedly failed to tell his parents he needed water as well as his feeding tube

Ben was born prematurely with cerebral palsy and short bowel syndrome – a malabsorption condition. He died at the age of one.

Just days before his death, he had been hit with an infection which caused him to vomit severely, meaning he lost valuable fluids.

His gastric nasal feeding tube ensured he got the protein and nutrients he needed, but his parents, who live in Southend, Essex, say they had not been told they also needed to give him water.

Southend coroner Yvonne Blake now plans to write to all hospitals in the area to ask for more advice and support to be given to families to ensure babies get the right amount of fluids.

The inquest heard Ben’s tube had been replaced by a community nurse the day before he died in July, 2010, but no concerns were raised with mother Natasha, 29.

Dr Liina Kiho, a paediatric pathologist at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, who carried out a post-mortem on Ben, found he had extremely high levels of salt in his body because of his dehydration.

She urged health workers to tell parents about the importance of giving their children water as well as their tube feed- especially if they have been unwell.

She said: ‘If there is anything in a child's condition which means they are going to lose fluid, which adds to an already vulnerable baby, it should really be taken very seriously. It can be a big challenge for a family having a child with serious medical issues who required nasal gastric feeding.

‘It comes down to the fact that the child needs to be monitored by the parents regularly and they need to know how to recognise signs of fluid loss and dehydration and notice the significance of the condition.’

An inquest was originally opened 10 days after Ben’s death but adjourned so more evidence could be collected.

Recording a narrative verdict for his death, coroner Yvonne Blake said: ‘Ben was a very premature baby with numerous medical problems. He became unwell through dehydration and this combined with his medical conditions contributed to his death.’

However, Southend Hospital, which treated Ben, insists appropriate procedures are in place to educate parents about fluids and feeding tubes.

It claims that before children are discharged, families are given unique instructions on how to care for them to ensure nasal gastric tubes continue to work effectively at home.

While fluids are needed, the amount varies for each person depending on their medical condition.

Follow up home visits are carried out by community nurses working for the South Essex Partnership Trust (SEPT) but monitored closely by staff at Southend Hospital.

Wendy Pearson, head of paediatrics, said: ‘All parents of children discharged with a naso-gastric tube are trained by hospital staff and sign a competency to ensure they know what to do before they go home. They are also given information from a consultant and dietician on the right types of feeds and volumes of fluid needed, as the requirements of each patient are very individual.

‘We work very closely with the community teams employed by the SEPT to support the parents of paediatric patients discharged with naso-gastric tubes, and the community team provides a 24 hour on call service available to any parent who has concerns or needs advice.

‘The community nursing team is also able to refer directly to the paediatric assessment unit here at the hospital if they have concerns that a child may be acutely unwell.’
