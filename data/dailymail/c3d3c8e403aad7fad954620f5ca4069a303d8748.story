An enormous monument recording the scoreline of every England national football team defeat is expected to sell for £600,000 at auction.

Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan created the untitled piece in 1999 to celebrate the England national side's regular disappointments.

Etched into black granite was every occasion the England side lost, from their 2-1 defeat to Scotland in 1874 up until Romania's 2-1 victory at the 1998 World Cup.

The enormous granite piece of art (pictured) is expected to sell for £600,000 at auction 

The artwork begins with a 2-1 defeat to Scotland in 1874 and ends with 1998's World Cup loss to Romania

The artwork, which is made of black granite set in MDF and steel, is 7.2ft high, 10ft wide and 2ft deep.

The piece starts with England's 1874 loss to Scotland and ends with its 1998 World Cup loss against Romania.

If continued until today, it would also incorporate Britain's losses to Uruguay and Italy in last year's World Cup.

Also etched onto the granite would be the team's 4-1 humiliation at the hands of Germany in 2010 and the 2006 exit on penalties against Portugal.

The piece of art will be auctioned off next week at Sotheby's New Bond Street gallery in London.

The monument is being offered with a guide price of £400,000 - £600,000, which the average England footballer could pay for with one months' salary.

CNN reported Cattelan as explaining it was 'a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death'.

Cattelan is notorious for his often satirical and biting art displays.

Perhaps his best known piece is an effigy of Pope John Paul II being crushed by a meteor.

And two years ago he made headlines when he placed a statue of Adolf Hitler praying on his knees in the former Warsaw Ghetto.

Jewish groups expressed fury at the 'senseless' decision to install the provocative artwork in the area where thousands of Jews were forced to live during the rule of the Nazi regime.

In total, around 300,000 Jews from the Ghetto died or were sent to their death in concentration camps.

The statue, entitled 'HIM', attracted a large number of visitors when it was first installed in November 2012.

The work was visible only from a distance, and the artist did not initially say what he intended viewers to read into Hitler's pose.

Organisers of the exhibition of which the statue was a part said its point was to make people reflect on the nature of evil - but others were furious by its placement in such a sensitive site.

Had the artwork continued to the current day, it would include England's 2006 World Cup loss to Portugal. Pictured is Wayne Rooney receiving a red card in the quarter final
