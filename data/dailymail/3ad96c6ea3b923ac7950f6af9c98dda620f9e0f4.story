'If you're on Facebook, you're not the customer - you're the product', says Abine security, which has created an online 'calculator' to let Facebook users see how much the site earns from them

'If you're on Facebook, you're not the customer - you're the product', says Abine security, which has created an online 'calculator' to let Facebook users see how much the site earns from them.

The more information you 'share' via Facebook - such as photos, and 'Likes' - the more you are 'worth' to the site.

85% of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising, so the more information you 'share', the more efficiently Facebook can target advertising 'at' you.

Abine's calculator asks a series of simple questions to work out how much you 'share' - and thus your 'worth'.

The calculator works out how much Facebook earns in a year from people, based on the number of friends they have, and how often they 'Like' products or services on the site

The calculator - created by security company Abine is designed to highlight the fact that Facebook's service is NOT free - and that advertising via the site is liable to increase once it floats on the stock market.

'For most normal people, this sale won’t mean a thing:  only wealthy investors will have a chance to buy in,' says Abine security. 'After the IPO, Facebook will have to take its shareholders’ wishes into consideration when making business decisions, and it will be under pressure to meet revenue and profitability goals. 

Some analysts say that Facebook will have to increase revenues by 41% over the next 5 years to meet its high valuation. 85% of Facebook’s revenues in 2011 came from advertising.

'Their  valuation depends on their advertising revenue, and their advertising revenue depends on their ability to collect even more personal information from users.'

Facebook already dominates the online landscape, according to data from Experian Hitwise.

1 in every 7 page views in the UK is to a Facebook page.

The social network accounted for 14% of all UK Internet page views in April 2012.

Facebook is twice the size of YouTube and 17 times bigger than Twitter in terms of visits from UK Internet users.Facebook receives an average of 40 million UK Internet visits every single day.'We created a Facebook Val-You calculator, which you can try out here, to demonstrate that each Facebook user holds monetary value.  That value is going to have to go up over time in order for Facebook to perform against its projected $95 billion valuation.
