After parking his car and taking a romantic stroll with his girlfriend, Tomos Williams decided to nip into a canal-side pub for a drink.

But his pint was ruined just a short time later when the 30-year-old was told his Toyota Avensis had rolled into the water.

He dashed out of the venue next to the Llangollen Canal, North Wales, to see his car submerged with only the roof showing.

Submerged: Tomos Williams, 30, dashed out of a pub to see his beloved Toyota Avensis underwater

Rescue attempts: A barge was brought in to try and release the car from the canal

Passers-by heard a loud snapping sound - 
thought to be the handbrake cable failing - before the car gently rolled
 down into the murky canal.

Mr Williams and his girlfriend Jayne Roberts had been for a romantic stroll along the Llangollen Canal in North Wales before going for a pub lunch.

Catering worker Tomos said: 'Someone came in and asked if I was the owner of a silver Toyota.

'They said it had rolled into the canal - it sort of ruined my day.'

Barges had to avoid the Toyota as it drifted across the canal near the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct beauty spot.

Retrieval: Police were eventually called to help drag the three-year-old car out of the water before it was taken to a garage to be examined

Police were called to help drag the three-year-old car out of the water before it was taken to a garage to be examined.

Mr Williams, of Caersws, North Wales, said: 'It is a write-off but at least they will be able to check to see if the handbrake cable failed.

'Another driver heard a snapping noise coming from the car so that is what I think it was.I certainly left it parked up wit the handbrake on.'

The calamity crowned a bad week for Tomos who is facing redundancy at the ready meals firm where he works in North Wales.

He said: 'I've had the worst luck this week - but I can see the funny side of my car rolling in to the canal - at least no one was hurt.'

Write off: The unlucky motorist, who is also facing redundancy this week, said the handbrake cable on the car had failed
