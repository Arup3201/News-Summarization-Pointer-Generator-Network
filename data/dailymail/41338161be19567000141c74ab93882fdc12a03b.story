An Apple Maps screen-shot of a New York City street on an iPhone screen recently posted online looks terrifyingly post-apocalyptic.

The image features a desolate stretch of road littered with rubbish and lined with ghost-like yellow cabs, perhaps shells left to rust when the inevitable zombie apocalypse struck the city.

The buildings look rundown and there are no people to speak of.

New York City: Post apocalypse or just a regular day?

'New York: by Salvador Dali,' wrote a user on Imgur.

'Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave. And consequently rising from it,' quipped another.

The Apple Maps app has been copping flack ever since it was introduced in 2012.

At Gizmodo, Brian Barrett critiqued the app less than 24 hours after it was introduced:

'Like so many things in life, Apple's horrific new Maps app would be funny if it weren't so sad. But after Apple decided to ditch Google Maps for its own troubled offering in iOS 6, users have been left with bad directions, incorrect business listings, and a missing Statue of Liberty,' he wrote.

Tidal wave: The Google Maps Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver (right), and the Apple Maps (left) version, which would have you believe it has turned sideways, and also that it's integrated with Highway 1A - which it hasn't been since 1959

Other criticisms include showing the wrong location of the Apple Store in Sydney, Australia, marking an entire city as a hospital, wrongly classifying a nursery as an airport, placing the city of Cork in Ireland inside the city of Dublin, and identifying the nearest gas station to be as far as 76 miles away from the user's location

Another potentially disastrous error in the app sent Australians looking for the town of Mildura into the middle of a national park with no water supply, 43 miles from the town. Some people required rescuing, forcing Australian police to issue a warning against using the app.

Take flight: If you were looking for Wilmer Avenue in Cincinnati, Apple Maps (left) would have you find it on the runway of the city's airport, while Google Maps (right) takes you safely to your destination

Apple Maps was top of the list ofÂ CNN's Top 10 Tech 'fails' of 2012 in December 2012.

Heads at Apple acknowledged the problems with the app and the company has been working on fixing the issues, but it seems there are still some serious problems with its 3D imaging.

'Apple made $9.5 billion just in Q2 of 2013 alone, and 11 of those dollars went into further development of Apple Maps,' opined an Imgur user in the comments section of New York's zombie street.
