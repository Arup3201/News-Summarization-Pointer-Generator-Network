Trainer Oliver Sherwood has refused to rule out a shot at next month’s Grand National with his Cheltenham Gold Cup sixth Many Clouds.

The Trevor Hemmings-owned winner of November’s Hennessy Gold Cup is a 33-1 chance for the race.

The Lambourn trainer said: ‘I am not ruling the National out but Many Clouds is having a quiet week and we will talk about it after that.

‘If you had told me at the start of the season he would be sixth in the Gold Cup I would have bitten your hand off but my gut feeling is he didn’t run his race. He jumped off sixth and finished sixth. He was beaten with a circuit to go.

‘The winner (Coneygree) is a very good horse. Like other trainers are saying about their runners, maybe he got us out of our comfort zone.’

Meanwhile, amateur rider Tom Weston, who was airlifted to Bristol’s Southmead hospital after puncturing both lungs in a heavy fall from Benbane Head in last Thursday’s Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup was expected to be released from hospital on Tuesday afternoon.

The amateur jockey, who had a spell in intensive care, tweeted: 'About to be let out to rest up at home. Big thanks to @IJF-official @CheltenhamRaces @NorthBristolNHS and all wellwishers. Feeling gd.’
