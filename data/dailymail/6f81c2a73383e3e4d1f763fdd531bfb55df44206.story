You might want to keep your fear of flying in check next time you're at an airport.

A new camera being developing in China aims to highlight highly-anxious people in the hopes of catching suicide bombers.

The device uses a stress sensor that measures the amount of oxygen in blood in various parts of the body, such as the face, to pick out suspects in a crowd.

The device was inspired by recent deadly attacks in public places in China. For instance, in March eight knife-wielding criminals in the city of Kunming, Yunnan left 29 civilians dead and over 140 others injured (pictured)

The device is currently under development at China's Southwest University in Chongqing and was inspired by recent deadly attacks in the country.

'They all looked and behaved as ordinary people but their level of mental stress must have been extremely high before they launched their attacks,' Chen Tong, an associate professor of electronic information engineering at Southwest University told Stephen Chen at South China Morning Post.

'The higher the mental stress, the higher the blood oxygenation. Our technology can detect such people, so law enforcement officers can take precautions and prevent these tragedies.'

When the body is stress it releases hormones such as epinephrine and cortisol which increase strength and concentration. 

Heart speeds up, sending more blood and oxygen to your muscles so you can take the body can take 'fight or flight' action as soon as possible. 

Chronic stress, or a constant stress experienced over a prolonged period of time, can contribute to long-term health problems for the heart and blood vessels. 

Other indicators of stress, such as changes in heart rate and facial expression, can be controlled with practice, which is why the researchers chose to focus on the level of blood oxygenation.

The camera uses something known as hyperspectral imaging which examines information across the electromagnetic spectrum and can pick out oxygen levels. The more stressed you are, the more oxygen is in your body.

Professor Tong explained that the mini-cameras would place a 'stress bar' above a person's head to help police officers monitor suspicious behaviour.

He added that device would be able to tell the difference between high-oxygen levels in the blood caused by moderate exercise, such as running, and oxygen levels caused by stress.

The technology is still at development stage and requires improvements in computing power to fit into a handheld device.

Even if the technical problems are overcome, Professor Chen says that the device will not be launched for commercial use until laws exist in China to govern its use.
