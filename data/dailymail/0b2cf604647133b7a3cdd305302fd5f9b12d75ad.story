Google Street View is great for virtually visiting local landmarks and bustling cities, but the service really comes into its own when mapping the far-flung regions of the planet. 

And the latest of these distant locations to be added is Greenland. 

It is the first time Google has captured the island and highlights include the Illulissat icefjord, the region's capital Nuuk including statues in honour of missionary Hans Egede, and the 10th century Viking settlement of Erik the Red.

Greenland is the 66th country to be added to Google's Street View mapping service and highlights include the Illulissat icefjord, on the west coast of Greenland. The Unesco World Heritage site is 155 miles (250km) north of the Arctic Circle and features the Sermeq Kujalleq, one of the few glaciers through which the Greenland ice cap reaches the sea (pictured)

Greenland is the 66th country to be added to the service since it launched in 2007.  

'Like the norseman of old, you can embark on a journey through Greenland, the world's largest island, with Street View in Google Maps,' said Alex Starns, Steet View technical program manager. 

'Although known for its sparse population, Greenland is chock full of glorious natural wonders and historical sites.' 

Google has also captured Brattahlíð, also known as Brattahild - Erik the Red's estate in the Viking colony he established in south western Greenland at the end of the 10th century. 

A reconstruction of a chapel, said to be the earliest church in the New World, stands near the original site in the town of Qassiarsuk along with a replica of a Viking longhouse. 

The settlement's ruins are in the town itself. 

Erik the Red first settled on the southern coast of Greenland in 982 during a three-year exile from Iceland.

However, these settlements disappeared towards the end of the 15th century and this was said to have been caused by the climate change and Inuit expansion.

One of the images shows the Illulissat icefjord, on the west coast of Greenland. 

The Unesco World Heritage site is 155 miles (250km) north of the Arctic Circle and features the Sermeq Kujalleq, one of the few glaciers through which the Greenland ice cap reaches the sea. 

Another image shows a statue of missionary Hans Egede in the capital city of Nuuk.

Mr Egede is said to have heard stories about Norse settlements that had  been 'lost' on the island and asked Frederick IV of Denmark to search for the colony and establish a mission in the region in the early 18th century. 

As a result, he is often referred to as the Apostle of Greenland and is credited as founding Greenland's capital Godthåb, now known as Nuuk. 

The mapping service also lets armchair explorers visit the coastal region of Tasiilaq, and the Hotel Arctic. 

The hotel is situated on the coast of the Ilulissat Icefjord and is designed to resemble an Igloo. 

It is owned by Air Greenland and was built shortly after the airport  opened in 1984 to accommodate passengers.

It has Igloo cabins  inspired by the classic Eskimo igloo in shape and design, and its on-site restaurant serves Greenlandic food such as musk-ox, reindeer, Greenland halibut, Arctic hare and wolffish. 

Google has also captured Brattahlíð, known as Brattahild - Erik the Red's estate in the Viking colony he established in south western Greenland at the end of the 10th century.

'Floating by Ilulissat, you can see why the breathtaking Ilulissat icefjord is the most popular tourist destination in Greenland. The stunning ice wall seems to defy gravity as it reaches up into the clear, blue sky,' continued Mr Starns.

The mapping service also lets armchair explorers visit the Hotel Arctic. The hotel is situated on the coast of the Ilulissat Icefjord and is designed to resemble an Igloo. It has Igloo cabins (the view from a cabin is pictured) inspired by the classic Eskimo igloo in shape and design and its on-site restaurant serves Greenlandic food such as musk-ox, reindeer, Greenland halibut, Arctic hare and wolffish

'Like the norseman of old, you can embark on a journey through Greenland, the world's largest island, with Street View in Google Maps,' said Alex Starns, Steet View technical program manager. The coastal region of Qoomua is pictured

'Greenland's wonders don't end with ice. Journeying to Brattahlid, where Erik the Red established the first viking colony in the year 982, you can imagine the history before you as you look at the reconstruction of the New World's first church.'

Another iconic place to visit is the abandoned Greenlandic Norse settlement, Hvalsey - home to Hvalsey Church. 

This is the best preserved Norse ruins in Greenland and the Church was the location of the last written record of the Greenlandic Norse in 1408.

Visiting Nuutoqaq, the colonial harbour meaning 'the old town,' features vistas, fjords and monuments to local heroes. 

'The iconic statue of Hans Egede, the Danish-Norwegian explorer who founded the nearby town of Nuuk, is a sight that's hard to miss,' added Mr Stands. 

'And for those of you traveling in country today, you'll find that Greenland's streets and neighborhoods have also come to life on Street View in Google Maps. So if you're planning a weekend getaway, explore before you go!'
