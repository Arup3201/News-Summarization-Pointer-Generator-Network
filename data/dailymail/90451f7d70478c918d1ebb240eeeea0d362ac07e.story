This is the terrifying moment a nine-year-old boy fell from a ski lift and hung perilously in the air for 45 seconds before plummeting onto the snow.

The child was on holiday at Pennsylvania's Liberty Mountain Resort when he slipped from the chair.

Incredibly, one of the adults sat with him grabbed his jacket, leaving the boy suspended 20 feet from the ground. 

Perilous: This is the moment a child was left hanging 20 feet in the air after slipping from the ski lift

Officials stopped the lift and rushed to the scene, shouting at the boy to kick off his skis.

Footage shows the boy shaking one ski off but before he could get rid of the other, the adult lost their grip and he plummeted to the mountain.

The adult in the lift can be seen flinging their arms after the child in panic as he falls. 

A team of ten paramedics skied to his side.

Crash landing: The child was told to shake off his skis before he eventually fell onto the mountain 

Panic: The adult on the ski lift can be seen craning with their hands outstretched in panic as the boy falls

To their amazement, he walked away with a minor leg injury.

Witnesses said the family did not appear to be using the safety rail.

The resort is investigating the incident. 

Adrian Delgado, who shot the video on his cell phone, told ABC News: 'At the end, they [other chairlift occupants] couldn't pull him, because it would be rocking the lift, or all three of them would fall.'

The National Ski Areas Association insists incidents like this are rare, and they have not recorded a chairlift fatality since 1993.  

Fears: Paramedics scrambled to treat the child who incredibly left the resort with a minor leg injury
