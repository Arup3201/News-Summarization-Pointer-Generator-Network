The New York subway system is notorious for its out-of-the box passengers. From train performers to the occasional drunkard yelling profanities, you never know what you're going to see.

But in this case, what drew attention was what passengers didn't see: clothing. 

That's right. On Thursday night, a drunk man was caught snoozing on the E train naked, wearing only socks and a pair of sneakers, the New York Post reports.

Snoozing: On Thursday night, a drunk man was caught snoozing on the E train naked, wearing only socks and a pair of sneakers

The post reports that in between naps, the man took swigs from a jug of Jack Daniel's as he let it all hang out on the southbound train.

Peter Davis, an editor at the Daily Front Row fashion magazine, had thought he'd seen it all but couldn't help but snap a photo of the outrageous scene.

'He was just really drunk. He would swig it and then nod out,' Davis told the Post. 'He must’ve taken four swigs in four stops.'

The post reports that the naked man rode the train for at least six stops with as many as 30 passengers on the train. 

Davis said that the man looked oblivious and didn't seem to care when he snapped the photo around 8pm.

He said that some of the other passengers seemed afraid of the man who didn't smell and was sporting a fresh hair cut.

'The one thing people did was move away from him like he was dangerous,' Davis said. 'There were a lot of blasé New Yorkers that looked — and then looked back at their iPhone as if he wasn't even there.'

Davis posted the photo to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where comments ranged from jokes about the man to concern.

In his Facebook post featuring the photo, Davis wrote 'Just spotted on the E Train. After a lifetime in NYC I thought I had seen everything...'

Some made light of the situation with comments like 'They turned on the heat on the subways today. I'm just sayin'... It was hot down there,' and 'He didn't want to take off his shoes and socks for fear of getting athlete's foot.'

Some Twitter users were more concerned, tweeting things like 'This is so incredibly SAD. His bag of life belongings must be next to him. He's probably mentally ill and tragically lonely.'

The incident seemed to be very similar to a scene from an episode of the popular TV show 'Seinfeld.' 

In a season three episode titled 'The Subway' Jerry has a strange train encounter of his own when he awakes from a catnap to find a naked man sitting directly across from his reading a newspaper.

Perhaps the drunk, naked, E train passenger is a fan.  

MTA officials were not available for comment.
