She was just 17 when she wowed judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry in the latest series The Great British Bake Off judges- all while studying for her A-levels.

Now teenager Martha Collison has landed her own column in the Waitrose Weekend newspaper alongside the likes of Pippa Middleton. 

The youngster, who was fitting in the competition between her school studies in Maths, Chemistry and Food Technology, became a favourite with the nation's amateur bakers.

The Berkshire schoolgirl made it through to the quarter finals, despite the sometimes ferocious assessments of judges, Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood.

At one point she nearly fainted because of the stress and heat of the ovens, while she was even reduced to tears when Mary delivered a withering assessment of her custard tart's 'soggy bottom'.

Her nemesis came in week seven when the éclair challenge proved too much for the drained and exhausted youngster.

'I was juggling revising with baking and it was just a bit of a car crash moment,' she said.

'When you're there on the location, it's the only thing in the world that matters.

'I never thought I'd be one of those people who cries. I thought, I'll be really strong and I just won't do it. But you just can't help it – you're just overcome with emotion because you're so tired and you've worked so hard for that one thing.

'It's a bit embarrassing, but you do cry. I think pretty much everyone cried at some point.'

However, the competition's youngest ever contestant is positively gleeful now after landing a column with the Waitrose Weekend magazine, alongside the likes of Pippa Middleton, Clare Balding, and Mariella Frostrup.

She has undergone something of a make-over to be pictured wielding a Valentine' Day cupcake on the weekly magazine's front cover as she begins a new career as a celebrity columnist and baking guru.

'I am so excited. I really can't believe it,' she said.

When on the BBC show, Martha was essentially following existing recipes, however her new column will feature cakes and buns she has created using the skills and tips that she picked up.

'It's been a learning curve, but through Bake Off I got better and better over the weeks, and I really fell in love with it,' she said.

Martha said the whole experience and having to work alongside older people was daunting, however they were very supportive and have become what she calls her 'baking family'.

'I was nervous that they were all looking at me like I was some child. Nancy asked me straight out if I was 10. But after a couple of weeks into it, I'd done some good bakes, I'd proved myself worthy to be there, and then I just relaxed and loved every minute of it, ' she said

Martha, who is a church-going Christian, said there have been some negative aspects to becoming well-known, but the competition has totally transformed her life.

Amazingly, she is spending her half-term break in Cambodia with the Tearfund charity as ambassador where she is visiting victims of child trafficking and doing baking workshops with them.

'Obviously you get some people who don't like you, and sometimes you can't help reading it because it just flashes up. But I didn't seek it out – I didn't read comments on news articles and stuff,' she said.

'Some stuff you'd see and wish you hadn't read. But a lot of mine was really positive, and whenever I went out people would stop me and tell me I'd done really well. There aren't many nicer things than people just stopping you and complimenting you in the street.'

Martha has connections with Waitrose in that she used to work part-time on the cheese counter in the chain's branch in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on a Wednesday evening and Saturday afternoon.

Martha's first column for the upmarket chain's free  newspaper will be tempting readers with a range of her own Valentine-inspired recipes, including raspberry & coconut ice cupcakes and mini berry pavlovas

She admits that all the time spent on baking and preparing for the competition distracted her from her studies. As a consequence, she says her results were okay, rather than fantastic.

'I was just happy to pass, because I hadn't really given a thought to them. Even though I tried to revise, I was thinking, what kind of biscuit scene shall I make?' she said

Martha is currently juggling her baking career with her A level studies, which will be now taken over three years rather than two.

'Bake Off has completely turned my life upside-down. I do things every day that 18-year-olds don't do, and it's just so exciting,' she said.

'I'm going to Cambodia to investigate child trafficking. And it's linked to baking because they've got a safe house on the border between Cambodia and Thailand where they teach the girls that have been rescued different skills,' she said.

She is also going to be baking with the Archbishop of Canterbury in front of an audience of 500 as part of an event to support the homeless in Birmingham.

'It's just a bit of fun. He wants to learn some skills. I'm teaching him to make a dessert that they can use in the homeless shelters of Birmingham,' she said.

Martha's column will appear in Waitrose Weekend, the chain's free weekly newspaper, once a month and she will also be sharing her recipes on Waitrose TV. The first one this weekend will be tempting readers with a range of her own Valentine-inspired recipes, including raspberry & coconut ice cupcakes and mini berry pavlovas.

Asked about her signature dish, she said: 'I always go to a good chocolate cake recipe, or nice hot cinnamon buns for breakfast – that's my family's favourite.'
