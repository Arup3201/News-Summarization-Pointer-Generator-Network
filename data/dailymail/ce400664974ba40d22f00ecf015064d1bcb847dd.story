It was a moment of horror for a Muslim man who was savagely attacked outside his mosque by a crazed assailant who shouted 'I'm going to kill you, Muslim' as he stabbed him on Sunday morning.

The NYPD identified the victim as Ahmad Bashir, 57, who was walking into the Masjid al-Saaliheen mosque in Flushing, Queens, early on Sunday morning when the attacker came up behind him.

The man said that the merciless thug sputtered anti-Muslim statements as he plunged the knife into his body in the mosque stairwell.
