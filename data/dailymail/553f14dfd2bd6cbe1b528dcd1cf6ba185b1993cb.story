This is the moment an impatient cyclist ignored red lights at a level crossing to speed across tracks, lifting his bike over the barrier after it closed in front of him. 

The man was filmed rushing towards the tracks at Chesterton Junction in Cambridge as the barrier's red lights flashed before him. 

Ignoring the signs he sped under the first barrier as it lowered, becoming trapped on the tracks when the second closed down in front of him.

The impatient cyclist was filmed lifting his bike over the barrier before jumping over it himself after speeding towards the track despite flashing red lights

He then hurriedly lifted his bike over the barrier before jumping over it himself, triggering it to be raised again. 

The man cycled off uninjured just moments before a train passed through the busy junction but was later given a caution by British Transport Police who slammed his behaviour.

'This incident at Chesterton Junction highlights the dangers of ignoring flashing lights at level crossings,' a spokesman said.

'While the cyclist was not injured, he endangered his safety and that of others with his behaviour.

'He was lucky but he could have been hit by a train or the barrier could have lifted him up.

'It is just not worth risking your life to save a few minutes.'

The spokesman added: 'BTP officers carry out regular patrols at crossings to ensure they are being used correctly.

The man then hopped over the barrier himself, triggering it to be lifted up again before the train passes

He was later cautioned by British Transport Police who said his behaviour highlighted the dangers of level crossings

'We will not hesitate to take action against anyone deliberately misusing crossings.'

About 138 trains a day travel through the Chesterton Junction at up to 75mph.

It is just a short distance away from a crossing at Waterbeach where a woman was cautioned for trying to dodge the barriers.

She tried to cycle across the tracks in September 2013 before being thrown back by the momentum of a train as it thunders past.

Seven people were killed at level crossings last year after being struck by trains either while they were walking or in their cars. 

Five were pedestrians while two were in cars at the time of their death.
