Anderson Cooper had a close call on the Gaza frontline when a rocket exploded just a few blocks from where he was reporting live.

The CNN anchor was speaking to the camera in the midst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Sunday night when a rocket exploded close to where he was standing, causing the veteran journalist to duck for cover.

He was discussing the death toll - which includes ten members of the same family - on the Gaza trip as Israel continues to hit Hamas strongholds. So far, 96 Palestinians and three Israelis have died since the conflict began last Wednesday.

Cooper has been updating his Twitter constantly as he reports from the frontline.

Following the blast, he wrote: 'Rocket from #Gaza City fired just minutes ago while I was live on @cnn. Smoke trail clearly visible behind me. 6th rocket we've seen today.'

He later tweeted: 'More rockets fired from #Gaza and reports of air raid sirens in #Ashkelon. Now, sound of call to prayers echo throughout Gaza City.'

In his latest message, the correspondent told his followers: 'Bldg hit by multiple rockets. Saw them slam into lower floors. Ran to scene. Bldg on fire. ambulance crews pulled out 1 man severely burned.'

Casualties: Injured children following an Israeli air strike on Gaza. Almost half of the 1.7million population is made up of children

In the latest Israeli airstrike today two children have been killed and several injured.

Anderson Cooper's near miss in Gaza is far from the first time the reporter has placed himself in harm's way.

During the Egyptian uprising in spring 2011, Anderson and his camera crew were attacked while reporting on the streets of Cairo. He made a follow-up report from a darkened room, in a undisclosed location, which was 'frankly for our own safety' he admitted to viewers.

Cooper has been on the ground to report during the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka in 2005 along with the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon then the Niger famine. He was also in New Orleans to report on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

As a college graduate trying to get his break in journalism, Cooper forged a press pass and sneaked into Myanmar, selling segments on the student uprising against the Burmese government to a news agency in the U.S.

Israel's Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted around 80 sites in overnight airstrikes which continued to hit the enclave during the early hours of this morning as the violence entered its sixth day.

Health officials said rockets hit two houses belonging to a single family, killing two children and a woman and injuring 30 others - half of them children.

It came less than 24 hours hours after several women and children were among 11 reportedly killed in an airstrike on a residential area as Israel expanded its targets to what it said were the homes of wanted militants.

Save the Children has called for an immediate end to the conflict between Israel and Gaza as fears grow that the situation will have a devastating affect on children who make up nearly half the 1.7 million population of the Gaza Strip

While Cooper reports from the Middle East, his talk show Anderson Live is being manned by first ever guest host Rosie O'Donnell today.

Cooper will join the show via satellite to give the latest updates from the Middle East conflict.

Shaken: The veteran anchor, who has reported from conflicts around the world, looked rattled following the explosion

Professional: Cooper kept up the rest of his report following the blast, telling viewers that the blast just a few blocks away had set off car alarms but he could not see where it had impacted

The big story: Cooper appears on the Election Night special earlier this month
