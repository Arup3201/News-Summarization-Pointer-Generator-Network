Southampton managed to avoid their worst run in 57 years with a resounding victory against Everton.

An own goal from Romelu Lukaku in the first half set Saints on their way and strikes from Graziano Pelle and Maya Yoshida then secured victory and halted their dramatic slide.

Had they been beaten by the Merseyside club then they would have crashed to their sixth consecutive defeat, matching an unwanted run set in 1957. It was certainly a motivating factor for Ronald Koeman’s men.

‘It’s typical of football that one day it’s black, the next day it’s white,’ was the Southampton manager’s assessment. ‘I’m a long time in football. The best medicine is to come back to playing like we did in the first part of the season.’

There was a sense of karma to the opener.

Referee Jonathan Moss made several iffy calls in the first half and home fans were getting on his back, but the worst decision of the lot ended in a Southampton goal.

In the 37th minute Steven Naismith delivered a terrible backpass that Shane Long intercepted, only to be clearly taken down by Everton skipper Phil Jagielka. 

The referee gave a corner when, in fact, the defender got none of the ball and all of the man.

From the resulting set-piece, however, James Ward-Prowse sent an expertly curled ball into the six-yard box and Lukaku headed into his own net.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez disagreed with the decision. ‘I felt it wasn’t a corner,’ he insisted. ‘It was never a corner. There was a debate it was a penalty, but Jagielka never saw Long and was looking at the ball. Long made the most of the contact

‘For me it’s not a penalty or a corner. I don’t think the ref is to blame though, we are to blame for the defeat.

‘We were a little bit soft, done too easily with balls into the box. It’s disappointing the way we defended our box.’

Everton have developed a nasty habit of scoring own goals at St Mary’s. Lukaku’s mishap was their third in a row, after Antolin Alcaraz and Seamus Coleman scored in their own net in Southampton’s 2-0 win in this fixture in April.

It was the sort of luck a team in Southampton’s dire form needed.And yet it always looked as though Southampton would need to score at least one more to secure victory. And that moment came in the 65th minute when Pelle finished from close range.

Nathaniel Clyne, in yet another brilliant performance down the right, picked out Long with a cross who headed the ball down for Pelle to poke it in.

They would have gone even further ahead three minutes later had Tim Howard not pulled off an outstanding stop to deny Jose Fonte. Ward-Prowse sent in another enticing delivery from a free-kick and Fonte headed towards the right of goal, only for the Everton goalkeeper to keep it out at full stretch.

But the game was put beyond doubt in the 82nd minute when Yoshida leapt to meet Steven Davis’ cross with the outside of his boot and sent the ball in via his shoulder. The manner of the last goal summed up Everton’s afternoon.

Harrison Reed, 19, was handed his first Barclays Premier League start and was a terrier in front of Southampton’s back four, shouldering huge responsibility for a teenager.

‘The key to win today was to win the battles in midfield and Reed was outstanding,’ Koeman added. ‘He showed a lot of energy and you need that to play and get the best out of yourself.’
