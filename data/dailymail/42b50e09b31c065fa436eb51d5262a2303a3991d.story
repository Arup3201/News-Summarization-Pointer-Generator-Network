In a chilling video released by extreme terrorist group the ISIS, Australians are calling on their fellow countrymen to join them in the Middle East.

The 13-minute production titled There Is No Life Without Jihad shows five extremists urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'.

Two of the militants are thought to be Australian, and one who is identified as Brother Abu Yahya ash Shami and speaks with a strong Australian accent is believed to have been killed shortly after the taping.

Words underneath his name read he 'Received shahadah fighting in the sawat in Al-Khayr (may Allah accept him)'.

The ABC report they understand the propaganda piece was filmed a few weeks ago in an unidentified location in Syria.

Another Australian, Brother Abu Nour al Iraqi says his 'reasons for coming to jihad are plenty' and 'when it comes to jihad there are two types of people.'

'Those who will fight every single excuse to come to jihad, and those who will fight every single excuse not to come to jihad,' the man says from behind a face mask.

A third man who is also thought to be Australian is pictured but does not speak, but at the close of the video ISIS assures his testimony is 'coming soon'.

ISIS,short for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and also known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), is an offshoot of terrorist group Al Qaeda.

On Friday, following reports that many Australians are involved in groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned the government has 'absolute determination' to prevent 'returning jihadis' who are a threat to the country.

Several Australian Islamists, including a convicted terrorist, have appeared in social media images carrying out bloodied executions during the two-week Iraqi insurgency.

The group are believed to be fighting with the extremist group ISIS.

Mr Abbott believed up to 100 Australians are involved in groups fighting in Iraq and Syria: 'Some of them are involved with this murderous, murderous Al-Qaeda splinter group,' Mr Abbott said, (referring to the  ISIS). 'Some of them are involved in atrocities.'

Also on Friday, extra Australian troops were deployed to Iraq to reinforce security at the embassy in Baghdad.

A spokesman for Defence Minister David Johnston on Friday confirmed that a small Australian Defence Force 'liaison element' had been sent to Baghdad to bolster security arrangements at the embassy.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott alluded to the decision when voicing his concerns about the safety of Australian staff bunkered down in Baghdad.

He said nobody should underestimate the threat posed by the ISIL, the terrorist group advancing towards Baghdad after routing government forces in the north.

'Right now our focus is first of all ensuring that our people in Baghdad are safe and that we have the capacity to remove them if necessary,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Sydney.

Also in the disturbing film which was released on Friday, three British men give their own testimonies and reach out to others back home, urging them to join the cause.

The video, which is interspersed with music and religious chanting, forms part of ISIS’s global propaganda campaign, urging Muslims to post messages of support on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. It follows the publication of its ‘company accounts’ logging assassinations, suicide missions and bombings.

Encouragement: At several points the man identifying himself as Abu Bara' Al Hindi claims joining ISIS will alleviate the stress and 'depression' of living in the West

The father of a star medical student who appeared in the chilling ISIS recruitment video and is in Syria with his younger brother says he disowns his two sons.

Ahmed Muthana, 57 from Cardiff says that if Nasser Muthana (identified as Brother Abu Muthanna al Yemeni in the video) and 17-year-old Aseel ever return to the UK, he would love to see them go to jail.

His comments came as it was revealed his 20-year-old son, was a key figure in a chilling recruitment video aimed at luring jihadists to Iraq.

Muthana has been offered places to study medicine by four universities and was due to begin his course last September. Instead he secretly made his way to Syria from his family home in Cardiff with his 17-year-old brother.

But their father, who said his sons had been 'brainwashed'  after they began worshipping at different mosques and grew beards explained: 'They don't represent me now and I don't want to see them again.

'I would love to see them go to jail if they return to the UK alive, if they ever come back.'

Propaganda: Among those speaking in the video is a man identifying himself as Abu Muthana Al Yemeni (right) - who claims to have travelled to the Middle East from Britain

This week, to the horror of his relatives, Muthana bragged of fighting for the  Al Qaeda-inspired ISIS terror group. He appears alongside two other young British jihadists in the 13-minute long, professionally shot video, which was posted online yesterday.

Named in the video as ‘Abu Muthanna Al Yemeni’, he says: ‘We understand no borders. We have participated in battles in Sham [Syria] and in a few days we will go to Iraq and will fight them, and will even go to Lebanon and Jordan, wherever our Sheikh [ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi] wants to send us.’

In a direct message to al-Baghdadi, he adds: ‘Send us, we are your sharp arrows. Throw us at your enemies, wherever they may be.’

Muthana is a former pupil of Cathays High School in Cardiff, where he was an A-grade student

After completing his A-levels, the former school council member received four offers from universities to read medicine, but did not take up any. His family said he set off for Syria about eight months ago.

Muthana’s brother Aseel was studying for his A-levels, at the nearby Fitzalan High School, and had dreamed of becoming an English teacher.

A group of 44 workers who were kidnapped by ISIS in northern Iraq have been released after four days captive, a Turkish diplomat claims.

The hostages, of various nationalities, were captured on Tuesday after militants raided a construction site of a hospital near Kirkuk.

Following days of negotiations, the deputy security chief of Kirkuk secured their release and they are now travelling to a safe house, according to reports.

The workers - believed to be from Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Turkmenistan - were captured as the extremists continued their sweep down towards Baghdad.

On Thursday, Turkey's foreign office told all citizens to leave Iraq as a further 80 Turkish nationals were kidnapped by militants.

Mr Muthana added: ‘I feel very sad. I don’t know how Nasser got out there. I found out that he had gone to Turkey because he phoned home and spoke to my youngest son.

‘He left in November. We didn’t hear anything else until now when we have seen the video.

‘I thought he had got married out there and wasn’t coming back. There was very  little I could do anyway. I didn’t think he’d got involved in jihad.’

He added of Nasser: ‘He was very kind, very quiet and was into helping people. I thought he was quite Western in outlook. He would play football and rugby with his friends.’

One man in the video, named as Abu Bara Al Hindi, claims he too is from Britain, and describes jihad as ‘the cure for depression’.

Speaking in front of the extremist group’s black flag, he asks: ‘Are you willing to sacrifice the fat job you’ve got, the big car you’ve got, the family you have?

The third British jihadist, who calls himself Abu Dujana al Hindi, says: ‘A message to the brothers who have stayed behind.

‘You have to ask yourself what prevents you from joining the ranks of the mujahideen? What prevents you from obtaining martyrdom? You are going to die anyway.’

British Prime Minister David Cameron has warned that Britain cannot afford to ignore the chaos in Iraq and Syria because of the risk that British jihadis will bring their murderous tactics back to the UK.
