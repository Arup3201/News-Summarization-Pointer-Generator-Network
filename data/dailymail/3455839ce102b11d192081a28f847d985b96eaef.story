Daniel Agger is back in his former club's colours for the first time since 2006 as the Danish defender officially completes his £3million move to Brondby. 

The 29-year-old central defender moves to the Danish side for £3million after eight years at Anfield.

The Denmark international has made 232 appearances for the Merseyside club, but has only lifted a single trophy - the 2012 Carling Cup at Wembley.

The arrival of Dejan Lovren from Southampton in the summer has seen Agger fall further down the pecking order under Brendan Rodgers.

'Liverpool have been such a big part of my life and my family's lives for so long, that leaving is extremely difficult,' Agger told Liverpoolfc.com.

'The opportunity arose for me to return home to Brondby and at this stage of my career it felt like the right decision for me.

'I wouldn't leave here to go anywhere else and that has been proven by my actions in recent seasons - I have turned down many offers to move to other Premier League and European clubs.

'I would like to thank the Liverpool supporters for the incredible backing they have given me in my time here and the warmth and generosity of spirit displayed to my family.

Case for the defenceThe Denmark international was signed by Rafa Benitez (L) for £6m in 2009

'This has been our home and somewhere we have been very happy and settled. However, more recently I have started to feel the effects of playing regularly in a league that is as physically demanding as the Premier League is, and I would not want to stay if I did not think that I was able to meet that challenge week in, week out.

'The club itself is very special and I shall remain a supporter for the rest of my life. I regard every game I played at Anfield as a privilege.' 

One person who is certainly sad to see Agger leave the club is his Danish sporting compatriot Caroline Wozniacki.

The former world No 1 tennis player, who is a devoted Liverpool supporter, posted a message on her Twitter account to express her surprise at Agger's departure.

'Woke up to the news @DanielAgger is leaving Liverpool. Don't understand Rogers didn't want to use him. Class player. He will be missed #ynwa,' she tweeted.

Rodgers wished the player well and underlined the 'unique connection' that Agger has shared with Liverpool fans during his nine-year spell at the club. 

The manager said: 'We wish Daniel and his family well for the future. We've been discussing Daniel's future with him during the close season and I know this is a decision he has reached after much soul searching and deliberation.

'Daniel loves Liverpool and the club's supporters, and has a unique connection with them.

'When we had the privilege to play Brondby in pre-season, we saw the esteem he is held in and I can understand why he would want to return there.

'On behalf of everyone at Liverpool, I thank Daniel for his service to the club and hope he finishes his career with some happy times in Denmark.'
