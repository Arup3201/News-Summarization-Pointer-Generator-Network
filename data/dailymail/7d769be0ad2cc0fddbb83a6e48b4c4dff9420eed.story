At least a dozen brides in Colorado are facing their worst nightmare after their reserved banquet hall abruptly shut down taking their thousands of dollars in deposits with them.

Stephanie Molina's May wedding is less than two months away forcing her to settle in venues she says after Excalibur Event Center in Aurora abruptly closed, taking with it her $5,000 deposit.

'He didn't really give an explanation,' Miss Molina told the Denver Channel after the manager, David Mendez, called her with the startling news last month.

Stranded: Stephanie Molina has been left scrambling to find a new venue for her May wedding after the Excalibur Event Center abruptly closed, taking with them her $5,000 deposit

Secrets: The banquet hall closed last month while allegedly only contacting some of their clients who had given them deposits that are still yet to be returned

'He just said the place was closed down, and he would need three weeks before he could give me my money back. And I haven't heard from him since,' she said.

Aimee Vasquez is also without a place to hold her August wedding's reception while short the $1,500 she put down.

'I honestly don't even know where to start anymore,' she told KDVR while on the verge of tears.

It was only on Monday that Miss Vasquez learned of the banquet hall's closing after a surprise call from her caterer.

Unlike Miss Molina, she says she never received a call from the manager.

She's since tried calling and emailing the business but says every attempt has been ignored.

Frightening surprise: Aimee Vasquez only leaned on Monday that she is also without a place to hold her August reception while short $1,500 she put down

Others: A mother, left, planning to celebrate her daughter's quinceanera is also down $2,500 deposited to reserve this venue while saying the manager isn't answering his phone

'We did our part and for him to actually not go through with it,' she stressed.

Then there's Monica Mena who put down $2,500 for her daughter's quinceanera who like the other women says she’s being ignored.

'I’m stressed, sad and mad because the person doesn’t answer the phone,' the mother told the Denver Channel.

'I still have some things to pay off for since this set me back, and I don't know how I'm going to pay for these things,' said Miss Molina.

A phone number for the business has since
been disconnected with its number removed from its Facebook and 
website. The phone number on the store’s front sign also appears 
partially peeled away by hand.

Promises: The manager of this event hall has confessed to simply being flat broke, but promises he'll return the deposits despite offering little contact to the nervous brides

Expenses: The manager told a local news station that part of the money collected from the deposits went to restoring the banquet hall, pictured

Mr Mendez confessed to KDVR this week of simply being flat broke.

'I don’t know what to do right now because I’m broke, I’m totally broke. I wasn’t expecting this problem on the all but it’s out of my hands,' he said.

Mr Mendez said most of the money taken from the women went into restoring the banquet hall that's used on certain weekdays as a night club.

He says he's going to work to return the deposits owed, even though the women say they’ve yet to hear from him themselves.

Early Thursday morning a Facebook post on their Facebook page provided a short statement to their clients.

'EXCALIBUR EVENT CENTER IT'S OFICIALLY CLOSED, DUE TO OWNERS DESITION!WE'RE SORRY FOR THE INCOVENIENCE! BUT IS NOT IN OUR HANDS!'
