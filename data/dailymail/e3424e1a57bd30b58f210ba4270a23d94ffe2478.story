The dirtiest secret of Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret may be that it’s actually a good movie.

Made-for-TV movies, especially those ripped from the headlines of high profile real-life drama, are often tawdry and flat takes on complicated situations. Look-a-like actors may add to visual accuracy of the film, but a Lifetime original movie is often just a Lifetime original movie: prepackaged, disposable, just watchable enough.

But don’t look to the recent failure that was Lindsay Lohan’s turn as legend Liz Taylor for comparison with Lifetime’s Jodi Arias film. Viewers are impressed…with how bad it isn’t.

Oddly respectable: Jesse Lee Soffer, left, plays Travis Alexander and Tania Raymonde, right, plays his murderer Jodi Arias in the upcoming Lifetime movie Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret that viewers have so far enjoyed

Though Arias murdered Travis Alexander back in 2008, her May 8 conviction is still extremely fresh. Nonetheless, Arias’ dirty little secret will be revealed, in case you didn’t already hear about it, this Saturday at 8pm on Lifetime.

According to USA Today, the film is the product of vigilance on the part of writers who sourced material from videos, court documents, and forensic evidence. And when the trial became progressively more sudsy, so did the script. And though the trial itself wasn’t originally in the movie’s script, writers were reportedly made to hurriedly add it in the eleventh hour, simply because it was too good to be missed.

'Every time Jodi Arias would open her mouth on the stand,' screenwriter Richard Blaney said, 'we would get calls asking if we could work it into the script.'

The movie’s drama—taken straight from the froth that was the Jodi Arias trial—may just be art imitating life. And the writers took great pains to write nuanced representations of the people they’re actors would soon portray.

Art imitating life? Airing Saturday at 8pm, the movie didn't need trumped up drama. 'Every time Jodi Arias would open her mouth,' said a screenwriter, 'we would get calls asking if we could work it into the script.'

‘The obvious responsibility was to speak for Travis,’ screenwriter Gregory Small said. ‘But we're not just casting aside what was going on with Jodi, either. She was a fascinating, smart, articulate woman. She seemingly had the people skills and the ability to have led a wonderful life, but some diagnosable deviance led to this.’

Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret is a ripped-from-cable-news saga of a woman found guilty of killing her former lover, motivational speaker Travis Alexander. On June 4, 2008, Arias stabbed and slashed him nearly 30 times, slit his throat and shot him in the head in what prosecutors said was jealous rage, and what Arias unpersuasively argued was self-defense, when, according to her, he attacked her.

Dirty Little Secret unearths no secrets, dirty or otherwise. Every sordid detail, it seems, has been trumpeted for years by the media, then recycled for months during Arias' trial in Phoenix that got blanket coverage on TV and in particular on cable's HLN, vaulting that network to record ratings.

Deadly beauty: The ripped-from-the-headlines movie comes just a month after Arias' murder conviction

Uncanny: Tania Raymonde (left) plays Arias (left) and the likeness is marked, though the actress had no access to the murderer, her portrayal was surprisingly nuanced

Portraying what led up to the crime, it's tucked handily between the May verdict for the murder trial and the July retrial in the life-or-death-penalty phase.

Dirty Little Secret is a pretty good film. It's a draw-you-in, sudsy melodrama stocked with guilty pleasures: romance, sex, obsession, betrayal and vengeance.

Tania Raymonde (perhaps best remembered as Alex Rousseau on Lost) is swell as Jodi, with a remarkable likeness to this sexy, young woman no man could resist, at least not Travis as he fought a losing battle with his Mormon principles to feast on this forbidden fruit.

Or, to use a metaphor straight from the film, forbidden coffee – which, as Travis explains to Jodi early on, he shuns as a Mormon because of its addictive properties.

‘I'm like coffee,’ Jodi teases him.

‘Very strong coffee,’ he agrees as he submits again.

Would Jodi approve? Arias, pictured, was tried and convicted in May for the 2008 murder of Travis Alexander. The film shows the events leading up to that crime

Jesse Lee Soffer (Jordana Spiro's jammed-up brother on last season's short-lived The Mob Doctor) makes a fine Travis – glib, blandly wholesome and all too relatable in his mission to have it both ways, relationship-wise: treating Jodi as a red-hot plaything while he nurtures a ‘suitable’ wife-worthy prospect.

Trouble arises, of course, as love-struck Jodi bridles at the strictly recreational role she plays in Travis' life. Even joining the Mormon church can't earn her an upgrade from her booty-call status.

Travis argues that he never promised more. When Jodi was gazing into his eyes, he tells her, ‘You saw lust. You saw weakness. But you didn't see love. It was never there.’

So, for a time, Travis thrives as a satisfied two-timer, while Jodi is increasingly desperate to please.

‘I just want to be the girl that he wants,’ she tells a chum.

Mind you, such an assessment of this film and its doomsday narrative is meant in no way to trivialize the real-life tragedy of Jodi Arias and Travis Alexander.

Dirty Little Secret is a step up from the reality-TV treatment the case has gotten with its more excessive coverage. The film also serves as a refreshing alternative for telling the tale, dramatized for maximum titillation while, in its tidy, two-hour package, efficiently stripping away the wretched excess.

An oddly respectable bit of fluff, this film would never be mistaken for art, which typically explores something larger than itself. But there's a lesson to be learned here nonetheless for anyone who looks beyond the tawdriness: If a lover seems too good to be true, he or she probably is. So watch your step.
