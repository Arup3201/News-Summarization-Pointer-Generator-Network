Dani Alves was caught on camera making a reckless challenge on team mate Javier Mascherano days after an angry outburst in a Spanish press conference.

A game of 'keep ball' in Barcelona's training session ended in an ugly way as Alves jumped in with a two-footed challenge on Mascherano. 

Fortunately for himself and for Barca, the Argentinia midfielder escaped without injury.

Studs up: Dani Alves leaves the floor with his studs showing as he challenges Javier Mascherano in training 

Impact: The Brazilian's challenge brings Mascherano to the ground 

He's ok: The Argentinian gets to his feet and escapes unharmed 

What was that? Mascherano looks back at the Brazilian defender after the challenge

Alves had been angered by suggestions that Luis Enrique was considering selling the experienced 31-year-old following expected signing of fellow Brazilian right-back Douglas Pereira.

‘I have two years left and I deserve respect for what I’ve achieved here,’ blasted Alves.

He was also angered by the treatment of former Barcelona manager Tata Martino in the press.

He said: ‘If we’re playing in a collective sport, the blame is ours, for good and bad.

'So people can forget writing stories like it was Tata’s fault because he had a different idea. No, for f***’s sake!

'Tata had the same idea as all our other trainers, but of course, we didn’t do our job well, and it’s Tata’s fault!'
