A drunken teenager crashed a stolen car into the front of a
£500,000 house owned by former world superbike champion Carl Fogarty as he fled
the scene of a burglary.

The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons,
stole the £12,000 Ford C-Max during a raid just five miles away before
crashing it into the luxury detached property.

The car, which ended up on its roof after smashing through
metal garden rails, a tree and a shrub, caused £3,000 worth of damage to the home
in Lytham, Lancashire.

The crash, which resulted in the Ford C-Max ending up on its roof after smashing through metal garden rails, a tree and a shrub, caused £3,000 worth of damage to the £500,000 detached home in Lytham, Lancashire

The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stole the £12,000 Ford C-Max during a burglary at a house just five miles away before crashing it into the luxury detached property which is owned by Carl Fogarty

It is not known if the Superbike champion was in the property at the time of the crash in the early hours of June 7.

Blackpool Youth Court heard how the teenager had been
drinking prior to the burglary and crash.

The youth admitted burgling a house in the early hours and
stealing the Ford’s keys as the owner’s daughter and boyfriend were upstairs.

They woke up to hear the screech of the tyres as the car was
driven away by the teenager who travelled just five miles before losing control
of the vehicle.

Witnesses told the court on Monday how they saw the youth at the wheel
of two other cars - an Audi and a BMW - before he was finally arrested.

He admitted dangerous driving, drink driving, driving
without insurance or a licence and pleaded guilty to illegally interfering with
the Audi and BMW and the theft of the Ford when he appeared in court.

Judge Jeff Brailsford told him: ‘This was massively serious
offending, dangerous driving and drink driving, over a long distance.

The teenager crashed the vehicle into a detached house (left) which is one of a number of properties owned by Carl Fogarty (pictured right with wife Michaela), who won four World Superbike Championships in the late 90s

‘You were lucky to emerge alive from that crash and lucky
not to have killed someone else - only a period of detention will follow.

‘If you were a year older you would have been at Crown Court
and would get a three or four year term in jail.’

Jim Mowbray, prosecuting, said: ‘The owner of the Ford had
left it locked in her driveway.

‘The loss of this vehicle has caused her serious problems as
it was used to transport her son around. He suffers from cerebral palsy.’

The judge heard how the offences were committed after the
teenager had been drinking at a family barbecue and then with friends in a
park.

When the defendant was arrested he told police: ‘I have been
very silly. I have been drinking and took the car.’

Gerry Coyle, defending, said: ‘My client has little
recollection of what happened - he feels, and some others feel, one of his
drinks may have been spiked.

Superbike champion Carl Fogarty retired from the sport in 2000 after a crash left with him with multiple injuries

‘He has no previous convictions - he has never been in
trouble in his life.

‘He has not got the sort of interest in cars that some lads
his age have. He enjoys joinery and has been offered an apprenticeship in that
line of work.

‘He knows he is lucky to be here and not dead or maimed for
life.’

The teenager was given a 12-month sentence in a youth
detention centre and banned from the roads for two years.

Fogarty, 49, is deemed the most successful World Superbike racer of all time and won four World
Superbike Championships in the mid to late 90s.

The Blackburn-born biker, who was renowned for his high corner speed riding style, was awarded an MBE in 1998’s New Year’s Honours List for his services to the sport.

However, he retired just two years later after a crash at Phillip Island, Australia, left with him with multiple injuries including a serious shoulder injury.

He has since enjoyed a stint as an ambassador for Ducati, who he formerly raced to success with, and now earns a living from personal appearances, endorsements and property.
