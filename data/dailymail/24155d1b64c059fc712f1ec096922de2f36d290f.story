When a Tennessee woman accidentally smashed her humble garden gnome on a sidewalk recently, she expected to pick up the pieces and throw them away.

But, instead, Heather Andrews found a beautifully carved statue of an angel fused inside the broken figure - and the mysterious discovery has got the whole town of Lynnville asking questions.

Andrews' friend regularly buys her garden gnomes as a running joke between the two, but the latest addition tragically fell to the ground and broke outside her home.

Strange find: When a humble garden gnome accidentally smashed on a sidewalk recently, its owner found a statue of an angel inside it

'My friend opened the door, and it dropped and fell. I went to pick up the pieces and noticed something inside it,' Andrews told WSMV.

Instead of being a hollow ceramic structure, the gnome had a statue inside the gnome that was formed.

Created the same time the figure was made, it's fused to the top and to the bottom of the gnome.

Some people believe the statue has the head of Jesus on a woman's body, or maybe it's an angel.

One of a kind: Intrigued as to whether any of her other gnomes contained similar surprises, Andrews, pictured, methodically broke open all her garden gnomes but to no avail

'I think the face has really intricate detail and someone spent a lot of time on the face. The anatomy on the body looks feminine to me, but I don't know. I am just biased to it, I guess,' Andrews said.

She added to the TV station: 'I just want to know where it came from, why they put it there,' she said.

Andrews lives in a small town and said a lot of her friends have seen it.

According to a sticker on the its foot, the gnome came from Target.

Curiously, this gnome was the only one to contain an inner angel.

'A lot of people are scared of it - just creeped out by it,' Andrews said.

But she's not afraid.

'We've adopted him and named him Pete,' she said.

Pete now has his own Facebook fan page, and his little mystery of why someone would go to the trouble of creating a statue no one would see, is gaining in popularity.

'A lot of people have told me that gnomes represent guardians of treasure, and maybe that's the treasure inside him,' Andrews told WSMV.
