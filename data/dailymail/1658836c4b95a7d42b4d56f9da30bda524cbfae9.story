Male train drivers in Sweden have found a novel way to work around a shorts ban during the summer months - by wearing skirts.

Drivers on the Roslagsbanan line north of Stockholm are required to wear long trousers or skirts to work and shorts are not allowed.

As a result, a dozen workers have been working in skirts to keep cool during the summer months when temperatures in their cabins can hit 35 degrees.

Cooling off: As Martin Akersten, 30, and his colleague Edward Elvefors, 32, are not allowed shorts while driving Roslagsbanan in Stockholm, they wear skirts to work

Train company Arriva has said they have no problem with men wearing skirts, saying the uniforms represent their company, no matter the sex of the person wearing them.

‘Our thinking is that one should look decent and proper when representing Arriva and the present uniforms do that.

'If the man only wants [to wear] a skirt then that is OK,’ Arriva communications manager Tomas Hedenius told local newspaper Mitt I.

‘To tell them to do something else would be discrimination.’

Dress code: Stockholm train drivers are allowed to wear skirts or trousers, whether they are man or woman, as long as they do not go for shorts

It can get really hot on the trains,' driver Martin Akersten, 30, told newspaper Aftonbladet.

'A skirt is nice and trousers are too hot.'

'Today a man in his 40s collected his uniform skirt, but other than that it's mostly us youngsters,' he added.

Arriva has announced that there will be a meeting in September to discuss future rules on uniforms - so for summer 2013, it seems to be skirts or nothing.
