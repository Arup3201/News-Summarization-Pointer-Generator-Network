Those who wish to break ties with the United States will have to pay over four times the price as more and more Americans seek to renounce their citizenship than ever before perhaps to avoid paying U.S. taxes.

The State Department once charged $450 for the service but now those wishing to say goodbye to America will need to pay a whopping $2,350.

Officials say that they've raised the price to, 'capture the real, unsubsidized cost of providing this service,' as higher demand for dropping citizenship has put a strain on consular resources, reports Yahoo News.

Crackdown: The rise in people wanting to renounce their U.S. citizenship may have to do with the fact that they are trying to avoid Obama's crackdown on hiding wealth overseas

On the rise: Those wanting to renounce American citizenship is quickly on the rise

On the up: Record numbers of Americans have renounced their U.S. citizenship perhaps due to their desire not to pay American taxes

It's not clear as to what exactly is making U.S. citizens want to break ties with the country but it could have a lot to do with the Obama administration crack down on those trying to hide wealth overseas.

Yahoo reports that between 2001 and 2008, only 3,937 people living in the United States gave up permanent resident status or renounced their citizenship.

In between 2009 and 2014 the number of people wanting to renounce their citizenship went up exponentially and reached 9,566, according to the International Revenue Service.

Since 2009, more than 40,000 U.S. taxpayers gave $6 billion in taxes, interest, and penalties.

The new fee for 'expatrians' or those willing to renounce citizenship will begin on September 12.

Though prices are going up, the number people hoping to leave the county will probably stay about the same.

Pushed for change: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas wants to make a law saying anyone who identifies with a terrorist organization should have their citizen revoked

Many of the people leaving are affluent and are hoping to avoid paying U.S. taxes and can afford to pay a bit more.

Andrew Mitchel of the State Department told Yahoo News that the fine is designed to weed out those who may not really be committed to talking the step of renouncing citizenship.

'They want to impress upon those individuals that there’s no going back,' he said.

'They’re making sure that you really, really want to renounce your citizenship.'

In addition to paying a fee, people wishing to leave the United States behind will need to go in person, overseas before an American diplomatic officer can sign an oath of renunciation.

In order to renounce citizenship a person must complete a questionnaire that asks people to say if they ever lived in the U.S., if they've gotten foreign citizenship, and how.

The questionnaire does not ask why they have decided to disband themselves with America.

Even those citizens who have fought for the extremist Islamic militant group called Islamic State or IS will not be automatically stripped of citizenship unless they fill out the questionnaire.

Not opposed: To the chagrin of some liberals, Secretary of State Hilary Clinton said she was not necessarily opposed to Cruz's proposal and that U.S. citizenship is a privilege not a right

By making it harder for terrorists to lose their citizenship, it will make it easier for Americans fighting for a terrorist group to be killed by a drone rather than lose their citizenship against their will.

Americans have placed high value on American citizenship and unless someone commits a 'potentially expatriating act,' they will not be denied citizenship.

'The Department has a uniform administrative standard of evidence based on the premise that U.S. nationals intend to retain United States nationality when they perform potentially expatriating acts, ‘an official told Yahoo News.

Some politicians like republican Senator Ted Cruz believe that people who fight for militant groups like ISIS should have their citizenship immediately revoked for fear they could re-enter the country to carry out an attack/.

The State Department met Cruz's proposal with resistance.

'We have the authority now to revoke their passports under U.S. law if the secretary makes a determination about their threat to U.S. national security.  We already have that power,' Marie Hart, a deputy spokesperson for the department, said.

'We also have the power if there’s a law enforcement request to revoke their passport if there’s an outstanding warrant or something like that.'

In 2010, Senator Joe Lieberman also tried to get the law changed so that anyone who provides support or resources to terrorists would have their citizenship stripped from them.

Hilary Clinton didn't object to Lieberman's proposal and said she would take a 'hard look' at it.

'Clearly, United States citizenship is a privilege,” she said at the time. “It is not a right.'
