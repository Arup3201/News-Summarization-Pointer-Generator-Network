Violent clashes between Indian police and thousands of people who took to the streets of the country's capital city to protest against the alleged gang rape and beating of a student have continued for a second day.

Police used water cannons and tear gas to control hordes of protestors in a high security zone in New Delhi after trouble erupted amid angry demonstrations following the alleged rape of a 23-year-old student on a bus.

Fighting broke out when furious protestors tried to storm a police barricade and reach Indian President Pranab Mukherjee's mansion and present their demands.

But while fighting continued, doctors said that the victim of the attack which sparked the protests has attempted to take her first steps in hospital.

The angry mob, who once again converged on an area which is home to several of the most important Government buildings, shouted 'We want justice.'

Footage of the clashes showed that some of the demonstrators have been injured.

One woman was dramatically pictured lying under the wheels of a bus full of protestors after police detianed them.

The demonstrations continued despite Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde promising to consider their main demand for death penalties for all six suspects who have been arrested by police following the alleged December 16 attack.

Mr Shinde had tried to reassure protestors that the Government was taking steps to better ensure the safety of women in the country.

A group of protesters met Sonia Gandhi, the governing Congress party chief, and her son and lawmaker Rahul Gandhi, on Sunday and demanded a speedy trial of the suspects.

According to the Times of India, three bonfires were lit close to India Gate, a First World War memorial.

Wooden barricades, set up ahead of Republic Day celebrations next month, were also overturned and set on fire.

The attack which sparked the protests took place last week and the victim is still in hospital recovering from her injuries where she is said to be in a critical condition.

She has undergone minor surgery and was put back on a ventilator on Saturday night after developing breathing problems, according to NDTV.

The victim is still being fed intravenously but tried to take a few steps at Safdarjung Hospital.

Doctors say that she is 'psychologically composed' following the attack.

Police banned demonstrators from entering a high security zone which houses the Prime Minister and several Government departments, after clashing with protestors all day on Saturday.

Police evicted dozens of protesters who had spent the night there.

But the ban was withdrawn early on Sunday and barricades set up to keep them away from the president's residence instead.

Protestors hurled stones and water bottles at the police cordon and pushed against steel barricades.

Only two of the six suspects, Raju and Akshay, have agreed to take part in an identity parade so far.
