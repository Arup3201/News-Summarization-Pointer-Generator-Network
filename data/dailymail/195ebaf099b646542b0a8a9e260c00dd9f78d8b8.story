Researches are refusing to hand over a
list of buildings in Los Angeles which they say are liable to collapse 
if an earthquake strikes.

Professor Jack Moehle, from UC Berkeley, previously said he would hand the list to city officials without making it public for fear of being sued.

However,
a spokesman for the Mayor Eric Garcetti said that when his office 
requested the list in order to make a head-start on tackling the 
problem, they were told they couldn't have it.

Which ones? A list of Los Angeles' buildings in danger of crumbling in the next big quake is being held back by UC Berkeley researchers

Last weekend scientists warned that a 
6.7 magnitude earthquake is almost certain to happen on the West Coast 
in the next 30 years and if it does 1,500 ageing buildings in LA could 
turn into death traps.

The research team, lead by engineering professor Moehle, looked at public records and 
did a walking survey in order to establish which properties were at 
risk.

The team found modest homes, 
millionaire high rises, and factories with outdated 
concrete constructions that had slipped through the cracks of city ordinances.

The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday
that the buildings are susceptible 
because they do not contain enough steel reinforcing bars to sustain 
them during the sideways shaking triggered by a large quake.

Neither Professor Jack Mohele, who lead the study, nor any of his team responded to requests for comment by the Times.

LA
officials have known about the dangers for more than 40 years but have 
failed to force owners to make their properties safer or to compile a 
list of endangered buildings, according to the Times.

The
Times compiled its own list using many of the same methods the 
scientists did. The newspaper had a team of reporters research thousands
of city and county records to identify older buildings.

The
reporters visited the buildings themselves, checked building 
permits and interviewing owners to see what if any quake-safety upgrades 
had been made over the years.

The
analysis concluded that more than 1,000 structures are at risk, with 
more than 50 in Los Angeles likely to fall down, putting thousands of 
people at risk.

Many of
these at-risk buildings include landmarks and 
buildings frequented by many of LA’s 40 million visitors per year—such as the Capitol Records building, Pantages Theater, the 
Hollywood Guaranty building, home to the Church of Scientology, and the 
Avalon Hollywood nightclub.

Many of the at-risk buildings were found to be in the Hollywood area, which is bisected by a fault capable of rocking the area with a direct 7.0 earthquake.

Full house: The study pointed out the historic Avalon Theater as in danger of falling down in the next quake thanks to outdated construction. It is now a popular nightclub with a capacity for 2,000 people

LA’s downtown area, full of outdated 
textile factories, is also at risk. This includes Scott Kim’s family 
business, which his family paid $5 million for 10 years ago.

‘It
went through other earthquakes, and it's still here,’ Kim told the 
Times. ‘I know back in the day they built buildings much sturdier than 
buildings today.’

However, Kim admits that no one walked him and his family through the seismic risks when they bought the place.

Two earthquakes, Sylmar in 1971 and Northridge in 1994, killed 125 people, injured more than 9,000 and toppled two hospitals, an apartment building and several freeway overpasses, including one that was rebuilt after falling during the 1971 quake.

More than 40,000 buildings were damaged across Southern California.

A 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan 
killed 6,000 and many were in concrete buildings.

Another 133 people died in a 
2011 New Zealand quake after two non-reinforced concrete office 
buildings were toppled.

A
2008 forecast gave 99 percent chance of a 6.7 magnitude quake in the 
next three decades, and 46 percent chance of a 7.5 or greater, with 
Southern California at the epicenter.

Researchers
like Thomas Heaton of Caltech’s Earthquake Engineering Research 
Laboratory worry it will take a deadly tragedy to create change.

‘We
know darn well that if a bunch of people die, there will be lots of 
stories, lots of reports, things will change,’ Heaton said. ‘But the 
question is, do we have to have lots of people die in order to make this
change?’

CONCRETE BOOM

The
City of Angels saw a massive population influx in the 1920s and a huge 
rush to build homes and business to accommodate the new Angelenos.

The era saw a concrete structures spring up en-masse, helping to pave the way toward the sprawling Los Angeles seen today.

In the 1970s, concrete towers began to line LA's famous avenues, like the historic Capitol Records building.

CONCRETE BUST

In 1971, the 6.6 Sylmar earthquake killed 52 people after the concrete structures failed to withstnd the tremor.

On such building was the 3-storey San Fernando Valley VA Hospital which collapsed, crushing patients in their beds.

The magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake in 1994 saw even more concrete structures destroyed.

As
a result of the two disasters the city tightened regulations for new 
buildings and began retrofitting older sites with steel beams.

However, attempts to force building owners to update their properties have largely been a failure.

The work is costly and owners are either unwilling or unable to foot the bill.
