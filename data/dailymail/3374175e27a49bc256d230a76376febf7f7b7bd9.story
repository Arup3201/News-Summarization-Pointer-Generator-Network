A Malaysian couple has been sentenced to death by hanging for starving their maid while she worked at their Kuala Lumpur house.

Shah Alam High Court Judge Noor Azian Shaari gave the guilty verdicts to the couple, 58-year old electrician Fong Kong Meng and his 56-year old wife Teoh Ching Yen on Thursday.

The New Straits Times reported the couple took the maid to a hospital in June 2011 but doctors declared her dead on arrival.

Judge Noor Azian ruled the 26-year old 
victim died of starvation because of the couple's failure to provide her
 with food or medical treatment.

The victim Isti Komariyah, reportedly from East Java, worked for the couple since 2008.

At her death, she weighed just 26 kilos, after dropping from 22 kilos.

The Judge said the couple's defence did not refute the prosecution's submission regarding the cause of the victim's physical condition and death.

The judge added that the couple's submission relied simply on a denial of the charge.

The trial started on July 30, 2012, with 16 prosecution witnesses called and six defence witnesses testified.

A court official said the convicted couple would appeal the ruling.

The BBC reported the case went to court after Malaysia and Indonesia signed an agreement to improve the condition of Indonesian maids in the country.

The agreement ensured maids were allowed to keep their own passports and were given at least one day off a week.

Indonesia had previously banned citizens from domestic work in Malaysia because of abuse allegations.

Guilty: The couple was sentenced to be hanged for murdering Isti Komariyah, an Indonesian maid, by starving her to death. When she died, she weighed just 26 kilos. A court 
official said the couple would appeal the ruling
