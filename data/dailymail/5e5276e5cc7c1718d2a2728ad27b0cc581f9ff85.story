He is just a few weeks away from his 93rd birthday, but Prince Philip showed he was still in fine fettle at the Royal Windsor Horse Show today.

The Duke of Edinburgh proved he was not afraid to pitch in when it came to setting up base for a packed day of equestrian events at Windsor Castle.

Despite suffering several bouts of ill-health in recent years, the Iron Duke was more than happy to reach in and fetch a number of picnic chairs out from the back of his car.

He then went on to take up his position as an obstacle judge for one of the equestrian races.

Prince
 Philip was accompanied by the Queen, who wore a 
light-coloured blouse and checked skirt as temperatures reached 25C on 
what was the hottest day of the year.

The 88-year-old Queen attends the show as a private individual and has also been seen on previous days watching the many equestrian events and browsing stalls that cover the site.

Peter
 Phillips, the son of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips, also 
attended the event, riding the carousel with his wife Autumn and daughters Isla and 
Savannah at the show's fun fair.

after he was seen carriage driving with the energy of someone half his 
age.

Like his wife, who still rides regularly at the age of 88, Philip has refused to give up the sport he loves.

In
 recent years, the prince has suffered several bouts of ill-health, 
however, the most serious of which was over Christmas 2011 when he was 
rushed into hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a 
blocked artery, which involved him having a stent fitted,

He
 was also forced to pull out of several key engagements to celebrate the
 Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 having developed a severe bladder 
infection after being forced to stand for hours in driving wind and rain
 during a celebratory river pageant.

He also spent his birthday - June 10 -
 last year in hospital after undergoing an ‘exploratory’ operation for 
unexplained abdominal pain. The results of the tests have never been 
released.

Yet aides have 
admitted it is difficult to persuade Philip to slow down, with one 
saying: ‘No one would ever dare tell him to take it easy - you might as 
well take your life in your hands.’

'The Duke cannot bear anyone making a fuss.'
