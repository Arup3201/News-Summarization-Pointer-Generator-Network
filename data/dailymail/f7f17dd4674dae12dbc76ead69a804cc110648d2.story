Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo could escape with just a two-match ban after seeing red on Saturday afternoon.

The Portuguese was sent off for kicking out at Edimar Fraga during the 2-1 win against Cordoba.

He had also slapped Jose Crespo – which went unseen by the referee – and the eventual red card wasn’t regarded as violent conduct.

Referee Alejandro Jose Hernandez Hernandez had little choice but to show Ronaldo a straight red card

Ronaldo also lashed out at Cordoba's Jose Angel Crespo prior to the kick out at Fraga

The official’s report does not contain any details of Ronaldo striking Crespo in the face.

The Spanish football’s disciplinary committee could ask referee Alejandro Hernandez Hernandez to elaborate on his brief summary.

If he chose to include the slap on Crespo, Ronaldo’s ban could stretch to three games.

The Ballon d’Or winner would then miss the trip to the Vicente Calderon in La Liga on February 7.
