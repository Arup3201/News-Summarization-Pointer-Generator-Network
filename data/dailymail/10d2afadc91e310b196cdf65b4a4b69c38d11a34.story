Alan Stubbs is closing in on his first job in front-line football management with Hibernian.

As Sportsmail first revealed on Wednesday, the Easter Road club approached Everton for permission to speak with their reserve-team manager about succeeding Terry Butcher as boss at the start of this week.

The Goodison club reluctantly agreed to Hibs’ request and Stubbs impressed chief executive Leeann Dempster during an initial discussion and has continued to tick the right boxes in subsequent talks.

Sources close to the negotiations last night described them as ‘positive’ and barring a late change of heart, Dempster will recommend Stubbs’ name to the board for approval over the weekend ahead of his unveiling early next week.

Former Easter Road No 2 Mark Venus was also interviewed by Dempsey and impressed the former Motherwell supremo.

Yet the fact he left for his annual holiday without having had notification of a decision from the club suggests he is being overlooked on this occasion.

Former Hibernian captain Ian Murray, now manager of Dumbarton, has also linked with the position but, contrary to reports elsewhere, he has not spoken to his former employers.

John Collins, Stuart McCall and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink were mentioned in dispatches following Butcher’s axing but were all non-runners.

Stubbs was quickly identified by Dempster as the identikit of the man Hibs were looking for to rebuild the club.

The former Celt is well versed in Scottish football from his five years at Parkhead between 1996 and 2001 and has made it clear that he covets a managerial job.

He was interviewed for the Everton manager’s job following Davie Moyes’ departure a year ago but chairman Bill Kenwright opted for Wigan’s Roberto Martinez.

Stubbs, who enjoyed two spells with his Merseyside boyhood heroes as a player, is well regarded within Goodison but he feels the time is now right to strike out on his own.

Provided his appointment gets across the line, his first game in charge will be a Ramsdens Cup tie on July 26.
