Applicants for a job interview with LG Electronics in Chile had the scare of their lives when the company played a cruel prank on them that has been turned into an amusing TV advertisement.

To promote just how life-like images appear on the company’s 82-inch ‘Ultra HD’ TV, LG created a fake office in which one of its screen was positioned to look like a window.

Four unlucky applicants – two men and two women – were then filmed in the fake office being interviewed for a job with the company.

Applicants for a job interview with LG Electronics in Chile had the scare of their lives when the company played a cruel prank on them that has been turned into an amusing TV advertisement

Terror in the sky? The poor unsuspecting job applicant has the fright of her life as something appears to light up the city skyline

To begin with, the interview process seems perfectly normal as the interviewer shakes their hand and starts to look at their resume.

But then the cityscape outside starts to change, the blue sky turns black, a meteor emerges from the clouds and suddenly the city explodes.

The combination of high-def images and sound is – apparently - so realistic that each of the four interviewees freaks out, panicking and screaming as they see what they think is their city being destroyed.

Next the lights go out and the poor unsuspecting victims are left in the dark for a couple of minutes to add to the drama.

The commercial starts with the fake office being created and a 82-inch 'Ultra HD' TV being fitted to look like a window

Everything appears normal as the candidates sit down to be interviewed

Suddenly the city is destroyed by a meteor and the interviewees start to freak out at what they've seen

The end of the world as we know it? The interviewee doesn't know how to react to what they've just seen

When the lights go back on, the door suddenly opens and in walks the LG team behind the prank to congratulation the poor unsuspecting targets.

The interviewee reactions after the prank are just as animated as some scream and shout, while others are quick to see the funny side of things and are probably just grateful that they haven’t just experienced the apocalypse.

It is a cruel but entertaining prank which does a highly effective job of promoting LG's ultra high-def televisions.

However, some comments online by those who have seen the ad claim the whole process was faked. They claim actors are playing the parts of applicants and interviewers to promote the company's latest television. Either way, it's not yet known which is true.

This type of marketing is called a prankvertisement and since the clip appeared on YouTube on Monday it has been viewed more than 700,000 times.

Survival instincts: Next they are plunged into darkness unsure if the world as they know it has changed forever

Everything okay! When the lights go back on, the door suddenly opens and in walks the LG team behind the prank to congratulation the poor unsuspecting targets
