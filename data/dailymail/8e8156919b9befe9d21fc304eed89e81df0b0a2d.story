She is known for her reluctance to take on the role of a traditional Westminster wife.

And Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam showed her independent spirit today as she shunned the convention of embracing her husband on stage after his conference speech.

Rather than going up to the podium to fawn over her husband, as has become tradition for politicians’ wives, Mrs Clegg, who uses her maiden name, Gonzalez Durantez, waited for him to join her on the conference hall floor.

Down he comes: Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam showed her independent spirit today as she shunned the convention of embracing her husband on stage after his conference speech and waited for him to come to her 

After waving to the hall full of enthusiastic members, Mr Clegg stepped down from the stage to hug his wife.

Mrs Clegg, 46, who is a successful lawyer, wore a business-like white shirt with an £89 yellow below-the-knee wool mohair skirt with folded front pleat from Cos and gold shoes from Spanish brand Uterqüe.

Last year, before his conference speech, Mr Clegg said: ‘I have not been successful yet in persuading [my wife] Miriam to march up to the stage and look admiringly at me.

‘But I will certainly come down from the stage and look admiringly at her, as I always do.’

Doing it her way: Rather than going up to the podium like other politicians' wives, Mrs Clegg, who uses her maiden name, Gonzalez Durantez, waited for him to join her on the conference hall floor

After Ed Miliband’s speech, the Labour leader was forced to brush off an embarrassing mishap after moving in to kiss wife Justine - who pulled away at the crucial moment.

The gaffe occurred when he brought her to the centre of the stage to wave to the crowd and cameras.

The pair managed to laugh off the mishap and later had a peck on the lips to make up for it.

During the 2010 general election, Mrs Clegg spent less time on the campaign trail than fellow leaders' wives Sarah Brown and Samantha Cameron.

She said she was too busy as the partner of a law firm and mother of three young children.

Admiring wife: Last year, before his conference speech, Mr Clegg said: 'I will certainly come down from the stage and look admiringly at her, as I always do'

What's so funny? Maria appeared to be in a fit of giggle as she listened to her husband deliver his keynote speech to delegates

In a rare interview about her personal life earlier this week, Spanish-born Mrs Clegg revealed that the Deputy Prime Minister shares the house work with her and said they tried to ensure that at least one of them was home with the children every evening.

Asked by Sky News if she was an example of how women can ‘have it all’, she said: ‘I never understand what people mean when they say “having it all”.

‘I personally have never wanted to “have it all” as a general aim. I just want to have what men have.

‘Lots of men have a successful professional life - or what looks like success to them - and they fit it together with a family and that is what I want to have.

‘There will be other women who don't want that. It is different for different women and different men.

‘But childcare is an issue, obviously. And I think that, as (Facebook chief operating officer) Sheryl Sandberg said, the most important decision of your life is who you decide to have children with."

‘There are lots of couples who share more and more (housework), there are lots of men now who are fully engaged with raising the children.’

Samantha Cameron may have earned her title as first lady of fashion thanks to her constant on-trend outfit choices but it seems that Miriam  is keen to give her a run for her money in the style stakes.

Miriam made a bold style statement today as she joined her husband at the Liberal Democrat Party Conference at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, Glasgow.

The 46-year-old showed off her slender figure in a vibrant £89 yellow skirt, which she teamed with a tailored white shirt, both from Cos, and a pair of beige suede court shoes from Spanish brand Uterqüe.

Comedown: Rather than going up to the podium to fawn over her husband, as has become tradition for politicians' wives, Mrs Clegg always waits for him to join her on the floor

Tradition: Miriam can be seen with her husband Nick Clegg celebrating last year's speech on the conference party floor

Style statement: Miriam Clegg made her way to the Liberal Democrat Party Conference with husband Nick Clegg in a vibrant  yellow skirt and crisp white shirt

The high-flying lawyer, who had obviously had a bouncy blow-dry for the occasion, appeared in high spirits as she walked hand-in-hand with her husband, who was en route to deliver his keynote speech to conference delegates.

Miriam's choice of colour is certainly bang on trend. The bright canary hue is the colour du jour this season and whether it's sherbet, buttercup or mustard, it's hard to go wrong. Plus, the midi style is the only cut to wear for AW14.

By teaming it with a tailored shirt, Miriam was also ticking off the androgynous trend, too. Her friend Samantha Cameron is also a huge fan of the style and has been sporting manly shirts over the last few weeks.

Androgynous dressing is certainly the style de rigeur. The high street has witnessed sales of trouser suits soar by 157 per cent after recent awards ceremonies such as the Baftas and the Oscars, where fashion's finest were championing the trend.

In good spirits: The 46-year-old Spanish native showed off her slender figure in a vibrant yellow skirt, which she teamed with a tailored white shirt and a pair of beige suede court shoes - a style loved by SamCam and the Duchess of Cambridge 

Style icons Cara Delevingne, Kourtney Kardashian, Madonna and Ellen Degeneres have been embracing the manly look since the start of the year.

Although the look has been a celebrity favourite on the red carpet, it has crossed over into everyday wear with sales of plain black and navy trouser suits up by 157 per cent along with white shirts increasing by 105 per cent at Debenhams.  

Bang on trend: Miriam was also ticking off the androgynous trend with her taulored shirt - her friend Samantha Cameron is also a huge fan of the style 

Bouncing along: The working mother had obviously had also had her hair styled in a bouncy blow dry for the occasion 

Out and about: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, his wife Miriam and Jo Swinson MP visit Castlehill Primary School  in Glasgow, Scotland. Mr Clegg is visiting Castlehill Primary School  to highlight  the Liberal Democrat free school meals and childcare policies

High flyer: With a successful career in her own right as a lawyer, marriage to the Deputy Prime Minister and three young children, Mrs Clegg, 46, is often seen as living proof that women are able to 'have it all'

Spanish style: Mrs Clegg chose jeans, shoes from Zara and a red printed top from Spanish brand Dolores Promesas for the visit

Bright shoes: Mrs Clegg attended an 'Inspiring Women in Scotland' event at New College in Kirkintilloch, Lanarkshire as her husband hosted his party conference in Glasgow

Flashback! Miriam also wore the bright orange shoes back in 2012

It was one of the biggest days for the Prime Minister as he unveiled plans for the Tory government after the 2015 election at the party's conference last week. So as his number one cheerleader, his wife Samantha made sure she dressed up for the occasion.

Perhaps fittingly, as her husband promised to scrap income tax, Samantha opted for an austerity-busting high street dress by Hobbs. 

The lilac Penrose Wrap dress retails for £149, but is currently in the online sale for £99. She teamed the dress with grey court shoes from LK Bennett and a healthy glow. Earlier in the week she look chic in an on-trend black midi skirt, paired with a khaki silk blouse and black heels as she arrived to watch her husband rehearse.

On arrival in Birmingham, however, Samantha, 43, embraced a more androgynous style in a pinstriped blue and white shirt, not dissimilar to the one her husband David was sporting, dark cord trousers and navy heels, the mother-of-three exuded an understated yet chic style.
