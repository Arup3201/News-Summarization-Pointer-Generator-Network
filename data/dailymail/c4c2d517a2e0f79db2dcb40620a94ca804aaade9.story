Olympic ski champ Bode Miller and his volleyball player wife Morgan Beck have confirmed they are expecting their first child together.

A rep for the athletic duo, who married in 2012, confirmed the pregnancy to People just weeks after Beck, 27, apparently revealed she was expecting while slamming Miller's ex-girlfriend online.

Miller, 37, already has a six-year-old daughter and a 22-month-old son from previous relationship.

He has famously been at war with the boy's mother, former Marine Sara McKenna, and the one-time couple cannot even agree on a name. McKenna calls the boy Sam, while Miller calls him Nate.

In November, Beck apparently accused McKenna of fishing a condom out of the trash to get pregnant with Miller's child after they met through a matchmaking service in 2012.

She apparently made the bizarre comments in a chat room for a pregnancy website.

'Girls do crazy things for money... including taking condoms out of trash cans and locking themselves in a bathroom,' read the November 18 post on TheBump.com, PageSix first reported. 

The claims were made under the username '2015mamatobe', which used a photo of Beck and Miller together. After users became aware of her identity, the image and posts were promptly removed.

At the time in mid-November, she also revealed that she was 13 weeks pregnant, which would mean she is due to give birth next May.

When the posts appeared, McKenna also joined the website to stand up for herself and dismissed the suggestion that she had used a used condom to get pregnant.

Cruel: Last month, a user on pregnancy website TheBump.com shared messages she had received from another user - believed to be Beck - apparently accusing McKenna of fishing a condom out of the trash

Growing bump: The couple, who married in 2012 and suffered a miscarriage in 2013, are pictured together on Thanksgiving. Miller pestered Beck for a date in 2012 after deciding that they were 'soul mates', she said

'Sam was conceived the old fashioned while we were on vacation in Florida,' she wrote. 'This Morgan thing has been getting a little out of control and downright scary and I would like it to stop.'  

Days before the online accusations, Miller and McKenna, who now lives in New York, finally reached a settlement following a lengthy custody battle. The details have not been released.  

Miller and Beck, who are represented by the same agent, met in 2012 after he called her and asked her out for dinner - but she said no.

When she continued to rebuff his advances, he turned up at one of her tournaments and cheered her along, which she found strange. But after the game they met and she agreed to go out with him.

He bought an engagement ring just a month and a half after that first meeting, USA Today reported.  

Day job: Morgan, 27, is a professional beach volleyball player and model from California

Record breaking: Bode Miller, a five-time world champion, is pictured competing at Sochi in February. He underwent back surgery on Monday but hopes to be back to the sport by next January

But they had many hurdles ahead of them: in early 2013, Beck miscarried their baby and the following month, McKenna gave birth to Sam.

Two months later, Miller's 29-year-old brother died after suffering a seizure. The couple call Sam 'Nate' in memory of Millier's brother.

Miller, a five-time world champion, underwent minor back surgery on Monday but has said he hopes to be back to the sport by January.

The couple lives in California. As well as Sam, Miller also has an older daughter from a previous relationship.
