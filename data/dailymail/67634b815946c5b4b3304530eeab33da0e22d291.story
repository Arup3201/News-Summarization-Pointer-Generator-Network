Banks have threatened to charge for current accounts if they are broken up to create more competition

Banks have threatened to charge for current accounts if they are broken up to create more competition.

And it is feared this would mean the poorest customers would be effectively dumped and left without an account.

The Big Five banks – Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Santander and Barclays – have held a stranglehold over personal and small business customers for years.

Consumer advocates say their domination allows them to rip off account holders by charging higher prices for overdrafts and small business loans. They also argue that customers suffer from too little choice.

Plans to break up the banks are intended to introduce more competition and create a better deal for customers.

The Independent Commission on Banking, led by Sir John Vickers, recommended the banks should be ring-fenced into retail divisions serving ordinary customers and ‘casino’ operations for City clients.

He said if that does not work they should be broken up.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected tomorrow to unveil reforms which could cap a bank’s market share to between 20 and 25 per cent, forcing them to offload branches to smaller rivals.

It is thought Mr Miliband will also call for a Competition Commission inquiry but his proposals for a market cap have been criticised by the Conservatives and Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

Giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee yesterday, Mr Carney said: ‘Just breaking up an institution doesn’t necessarily create or enable a more intensive competitive structure.’

A senior source at one of the biggest 
banks said yesterday the reforms would lead to banks either getting rid 
of their poorest and least profitable customers or charging them fees 
they can ill afford.

He said they will also increase pressure on lenders to introduce fees for all current account holders.

Currently, four in five current accounts are free, while there are more than nine million basic bank accounts for poorer customers, who are only allowed to deposit and withdraw money, but cannot have an overdraft.

These free accounts cater for lower earners, the unemployed and  those on benefits.

One executive said: ‘If you go down this route the people who will suffer will be the lowest earners. This would be a disaster for financial inclusion and mean many people will be left without current accounts.’

Shadow Treasury Minister Chris Leslie hit back, saying: ‘It’s almost predictable that banks will stoop so low as to use these appalling scare tactics to preserve the status quo and avoid major reforms of the banking sector.’

But Tory MP Mark Garnier, a member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘These simplistic, interventionist ideas show the economic illiteracy of the Labour leadership.

'It is inevitable that banks will become more selective about customers and many low earners could be frozen out of the market.’
