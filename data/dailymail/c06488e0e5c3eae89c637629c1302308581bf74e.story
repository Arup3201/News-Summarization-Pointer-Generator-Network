Manchester United teenager Saidy Janko celebrated his league debut with a stunning goal that ended Bolton's winless run and left Championship rivals Fulham looking over their shoulders at the bottom three.

Janko, who joined Bolton on loan last week as part of the deal that took Andy Kellett to Old Trafford, showed Louis van Gaal what wingers can do by smashing a right-foot shot past Marcus Bettinelli after 80 minutes to help his new club mount a deserved comeback.

'It was a miraculous goal,' said delighted Bolton boss Neil Lennon. 'Saidy is very old school, he takes the full-back on and tries to beat him.'

Fulham led after 21 minutes when Shaun Hutchinson turned in from close range but 36-year-old Eidur Gudjohnsen, captaining Bolton for the first time, levelled shortly before the interval with a clever finish from Janko's cross.

Bolton dominated the second half but had to wait until Janko's right-foot hammer to go ahead.

And in the final minute, Fulham's misery was complete when Bettinelli cleared straight to Le Fondre in and the striker finished into an empty net.

Talking about 19-year-old Janko's contribution, Lennon quipped: 'You would like to think he was happy, but you never know because he is so level-headed.

'You could see he was a bit tentative early on but once he got up and running, he put the turbos on.

While Bolton celebrated their first win in six matches, Fulham are now only five points clear of Millwall in the final relegation place and their manager Kity Symons admitted: 'We have to get our own house in order.'
