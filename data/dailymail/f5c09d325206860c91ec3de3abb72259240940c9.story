Are Manchester United out of the title race?

Honeymoon over. Not that everything been going swimmingly for David Moyes since leaving Everton for Manchester United. But things took a serious turn for worse after Wednesday night's encounter with the ex.

Vitriol and hatred poured down from the visiting fans to Moyes's right after a late winner from Bryan Oviedo condemned Manchester United to their fourth defeat of the Barclays Premier League campaign.

How the Merseysiders gloated as they rejoiced amid the billowing blue smoke of a flare with a full repertoire of songs. 'Are you watching David Moyes?', 'You're getting sacked in the morning' and, a favourite all night: 'Oh David Moyes is full of s***'.

Roberto Martinez turned towards them 
at the final whistle and offered his applause and Sylvain Distin hoisted
 match-winner Oviedo up onto his shoulders.

The
 symbolism was lost on no-one. In 11 years as Everton manager, Moyes had
 never been able to secure a Premier League win at United, Liverpool, 
Chelsea or Arsenal.

Martinez
 did it at the first time of asking and Everton won at Old Trafford for 
the first time in 21 years. 'It was more than a football game,' said the Toffees boss after ending the hoodoo.

As
 the visitors enjoyed their victory, United fans sped for the exits. 
They will wake today to the reality that the champions are languishing 
ninth in the Premier League, a dozen points adrift of pacesetters 
Arsenal.

All of their 
closest rivals won on a busy night and to make matters worse, Wayne 
Rooney collected his fifth yellow card of the season and will miss 
Saturday's game at home to Newcastle.

It
 might have been worse for Rooney. He was booked for a launching a 
shoulder into Phil Jagielka's face. As ever, on a night of frustration, 
United's talisman flirted with trouble.

Jagielka
 turned away holding his mouth and Martinez, standing close by, reacted 
angrily, although he had calmed down by the time he spoke after the 
match and agreed a yellow card was the right decision.

Up for the challenge: Manchester United ace Wayne Rooney takes a shot at Tim Howard's Everton goal

Moyes
 could offer no assurances that the mysterious groin injury which is 
keeping Robin van Persie out of action would be cured in time to face 
Newcastle, when he desperately needs a win to stay in touch at the top.

Chances are being missed and they 
look frail at the back and it will be no consolation that this 
defeat was a thrilling contest which could have been won before Oviedo 
struck in the 85th minute.

Rooney
 and Danny Welbeck hit the woodwork and, although United can claim to 
have been the better team overall. Tim Howard produced some wonderful 
saves but Everton were always dangerous on the break.

Romelu Lukaku in particular, with his muscle and fluent movement, gave Nemanja Vidic a torrid night and set up Oviedo's goal.

Jose
 Mourinho may not have been impressed with some of the thing Lukaku has 
said since leaving Stamford Bridge on loan but he cannot help but enjoy 
his progress, again assisting in a win against one of the Chelsea's 
title rivals.

Close encounter: Ryan Giggs heads over Sylvain Distin (centre) but cannot find the net

The same could be said of Gareth Barry, quietly effective as ever, filling the holes and knitting play together.

Lukaku
 lashed shot wide with only a few minutes gone and David de Gea beat 
away a fierce shot which exploded from the right boot of Kevin Mirallas.

United
 gradually built some tempo. Howard saved from Rooney and Shinji Kagawa 
and Old Trafford roared its disapproval at a couple of first-half 
decisions by Martin Atkinson, never a popular referee in these parts.

Atkinson
 did get it right when Welbeck darted into the box and took a tumble and
 the appeal went up for a penalty. The referee played on and replays 
suggested it was a good call.

Ryan
 Giggs went close, glancing a header inches wide of the far post from 
Rafael's cross and Rooney went closer still when his low effort clipped 
Jagielka and Distin and thumped into the foot of a post with the 
goalkeeper frozen.

No old pals' act: Former Everton midfielder Fellaini battles with his old team-mate Steven Pienaar

For half 
an hour before half-time, United forced Everton back and Marouane 
Fellaini grew in stature. Fellaini prowled the width of halfway, 
collecting scraps, leaning around with his giant frame, easing 
possession away from the would-be counter-attackers in blue shirts.

Yet
 he could not stop everything. Ross Barkley slipped away but his effort 
faded away from 20 yards and, on one of the rare occasions Fellaini 
allowed himself ahead of the ball, Rafael's pass was loose and Everton 
broke dangerously.

It was a 
warning of what would happen in a game so precariously balanced. low 
cross sparked a pinball routine before the interval. Rooney missed his 
kick and then had a second chance when a ricochet spun his way from 
Oviedo. Again he failed to connect properly.

Old
 Trafford pulsated. Just as United seemed to be smothering Howard's 
goal, the visitors would wriggle free and threaten on the break. Gerard 
Deulofeu had only been on a few seconds when he found himself clean 
through but unable to beat De Gea.

Howard's
 best save of the night, a reflex reaction to deny Patrice Evra's close range 
header from a corner. He could only paw it as far as Welbeck, who craned
 his neck and headed against the bar.

Jagielka
 hooked it away. If it had the look of another one of the those nights 
for Moyes, it would get worse when Lukaku swung a low cross in from the 
right, where Oviedo pounced.

It
 was a second in as many games for the Costa Rican left back deputising 
for Leighton Baines, the defender wanted by former Everton boss Moyes, who has already plundered Goodison for his coaching staff and 
Fellaini.

Little wonder they enjoyed ending the honeymoon.

MOYES GETS A SKIPLOAD OF ABUSE

David Moyes said that he expected a 'mixed’ reception from the travelling Everton fans.Well, if by mixed he meant a colourful collection of abusive chants, then we suppose he was right. The tone of their scorn was, fundamentally, that their former boss is full of rubbish, or words to that effect. Wayne Rooney was also flipped a few fiery fingers when he was taking his first corner beneath the blue contingent.

WILL BAINES BE BACK SOON?

Leighton Baines was present on the Everton bench. Currently sidelined with a broken toe, he isexpected to be out until January. The England left back was the subject of a failed approach fromUnited towards the end of the summer transfer window. There is talk of a renewed bid in the newyear. That being the case, his next outing could well be back here at Old Trafford...

MUTUAL RESPECT BETWEEN MOYES AND MARTINEZ

Moyes and Roberto Martinez enjoyed a warm exchange before the game kicked off, but the pair could not have been further apart during the contest. The Scot and Spaniard kept to the extreme edges of their technical zones for the majority of the match and thus avoided any prospect of confrontation. There appears to be a genuine respect between the two Premier League bosses.

HERO FOULKES REMEMBERED FONDLY

Respect, too, was the best way to describe the pre-game applause for survivor of the 1958Munich air disaster and 1968 European Cup winner Bill Foulkes, who died last week at the age of 81. Both sets of supporters took to their feet to pay tribute to the former Manchester United centre half who appeared 688 times for the Red Devils. That, however, was merely a momentary truce between the United and Everton supporters, albeit a most pleasant one.
