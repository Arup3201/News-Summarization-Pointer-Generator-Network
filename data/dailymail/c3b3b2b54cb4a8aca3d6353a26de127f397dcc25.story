Sensitive discussions between Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Prime Minister Tony Abbott were conducted over secure phone lines and were not monitored, the prime minister has confirmed.

The assurance was made in the wake of reports that Ms Bishop's mobile phone was hacked while she was dealing with the MH17 tragedy overseas.

The Herald Sun said Australian intelligence officials seized the phone when she returned from a trip negotiating access to the MH17 crash site in the Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed in eastern Ukraine last month, killing 298 passengers and crew.

Julie Bishop this week accused Russia of trying to shift people and equipment into eastern Ukraine by claiming there was a humanitarian crisis in the area

Australian intelligence agencies know which country those responsible for compromising the phone were from, the Herald Sun report said.

The phone was not used to discuss sensitive communications and was replaced.

Mr Abbott said he hadn't discussed this with Ms Bishop.

'It's well known that some countries do seek to, I suppose, target the phones of significant members of the Australian government. It's the sort of thing that does happen from time to time,' he told reporters in Lithgow, NSW.

'But I can assure the Australian people that the very significant discussions that Julie Bishop was part of with me and with other members of the National Security Committee in recent times were all done over secure lines.'

The suggestion that the several hundred trucks headed for eastern Ukraine could be a pretext for military intervention reportedly frustrated Russia's foreign ministry

The hacking report comes after Russia's foreign ministry hit out at Ms Bishop, labeling her comments on the Russian aid convoy to Ukraine as 'absurd' and 'irresponsible'.

Ms Bishop this week accused Russia of trying to shift people and equipment into eastern Ukraine by claiming there was a humanitarian crisis in the area.

But the suggestion that the several hundred trucks headed for eastern Ukraine could be a pretext for military intervention reportedly frustrated Russia's foreign ministry.

A statement from the Russian government department said that 'burdened by their own oversized ambitions, some members of the current Australian Government have completely lost an adequate picture of the developments in Ukraine', Itar-Tass news agency reports.

'They keep making absurd statements that the humanitarian convoy to help civilians in the south-east of Ukraine can be used as a pretext for Russia’s ‘armed invasion’ of the neighbouring country,

'Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has gone farther than others in making irresponsible innuendoes against our country even though one would think that her position presupposes building bridges between countries, not destroying them.'

Australia has imposed sanctions against Russian officials and companies over the current situation in Ukraine.

A convoy of 280 trucks is currently on its way from Russia to Ukraine.

The trucks are carrying 2,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid, including 400 tonnes of cereal, 100 tonnes of sugar and 62 tonnes of baby food.

There's also 54 tonnes of medical equipment, 12,000 sleeping bags and 69 generators headed Ukraine's way.
