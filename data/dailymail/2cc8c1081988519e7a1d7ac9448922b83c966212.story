To the wearer, they might be considered a brave, but stylish, garment.

To everyone else, they scream awful.

The red trouser - traditionally sported by the wealthy at high society events - has now infested the high street, with many a man squeezing themselves into the garment.

'Yuk', 'odd' and 't***' were all words associated with gentlemen who dared to introduce a flash of scarlet into their wardrobe, according to a YouGov survey

And it would appear that although they may be popular with shoppers, they are widely considered a faux pas by the rest of society.

A YouGov survey questioned Britons what they thought of men who donned the fiery-coloured trousers and the response showed a firm dislike from much of the population.

The study said: 'Almost half of people in Britain (46 per cent) say they don’t like men wearing red trousers, including 24 per cent of the population who 'don’t like at all' red-trousered folk.

'In comparison, just 12 per cent of Britons think well of the gentlemen in red.

'More than four in ten (43 per cent), however, either don't know or don't care about the latest addition to the regular man's wardrobe.'

YouGov's survey found that when 
respondents were asked to give the first word that came to their minds 
when they see a man wearing red trousers.

Whereas it had previously been a 
regular feature of the wealthy person's wardrobe, 'posh' was only the 
35th most-submitted word in the questionnaire.

The
 most popular submission was simply 'red', but many of the popular words
 were negative: 'idiot' was the third most popular term when asked what 
they associated red trousers with.

'Yuk', 'odd' and 't***' came in sixth, seventh and ninth place respectively.

'Clown' and 'prat' were also used to describe the bold clothing choice, but 'cool' and 'nice' also flashed across people's minds when they spotted the eye-catching clothes, the study found.

Should the sartorially-minded man refuse to bow to public pressure, he might want to consider wearing them in particular locations, if he wants to draw compliments and not catty comments.

YouGov's study said: 'Although Londoners are just as likely as the nation as a whole to dislike red trousers, a fifth of Londoners (20 per cent) do like them, making people in London twice as red trouser-friendly as people from the Midlands and Wales (10 per cent) or Scotland (9 per cent).
