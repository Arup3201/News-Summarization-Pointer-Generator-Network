A convicted robber who attended the same public school as Prince Charles has said his time at the boarding institution prepared him for prison.

Paul Macklin has compared serving time for armed robbery to boarding at Gordonstoun School in Elgin, Moray.

The 40-year-old son of a millionaire businessman has just been released from prison after serving almost a decade for threatening two police officers with a gun in 2003.

From public school to prison: Paul Macklin, who has spent nearly a decade behind bars for armed robbery says his time at Gordonstoun School prepared him for prison

Macklin has been proclaiming his innocence since his arrest and recently failed to overturn his conviction, which had previously been shortened from 15 years on appeal.

Speaking today, shortly after his release, Macklin said: ‘I never found prison particularly hard. It was just like Gordonstoun.'

Fellow alumnus Prince Charles Prince of Wales has described his time at the school as ‘a prison sentence’ and the young royal was bullied by his peers.

Macklin said: ‘I remember one disgraced aristocrat, who had been to Eton, was asked how he survived when he came home from prison.

‘He said that any man who had been to a public school or in the Army will be quite at home. For me, that’s how it was.'

Institution: Paul Macklin attended Gordonstoun School in Elgin, Moray and, like fellow student Prince Charles, compares it to prison

Fellow student: Prince Charles, pictured last week, described Gordonstoun School as 'Colditz in kilts' and contemporary pupils say he was bullied during his time there

Not a fan: Prince Charles, pictured arriving at King's Cross Station to spend Christmas in London in 1962, attended the boarding school in Scotland from the age of 13

He added: ‘You are living there eight months a year with around 50 to 60 other boys.

‘Obviously, there is not a lot of parental supervision and you have a culture of 13 to 18 year-olds who live among themselves and police themselves.

‘It creates a very independent child from an early age.’

Prince Charles attended Gordonstoun from the age of 13 and left after his A-levels.

The Prince of Wales hated his time at the boarding school later describing it as ‘a prison sentence,’ and ‘Colditz with kilts.’

His contemporaries recalled that he was bullied and lonely during his years at the school.

After rules on smoking and drinking were tightened ahead of the young Prince’s arrival, older students blamed Charles and tormented him as a result.

It was Prince Phillip, an alumnus of Gordonstoun, who decided to send Charles there and Princes Edward and Andrew followed

It is thought that the Queen disagreed and would have liked Charles to attend Eton which is closer to home in Windsor.

Macklin claimed he turned to crime after his love of adrenaline sports spiralled out of control.

He said the turning point came
after he watched the 1991 action film Point Break, the story of 
thrill-seeking surfers who commit a string of bank robberies.

Macklin first hit the headlines in 
1994, when he and another former public schoolboy Robert Cadiz were 
jailed for a total of 17 years after being convicted of conspiring to 
stage a £300,000 armed robbery.

The
pair attempted to snatch the cash from an Aberdeen City Council depot 
in Kittybrewster while armed with guns, ammunition, wirecutters and 
tools.

He made his escape by
threatening police with a shotgun and holding the weapon to a passing 
motorist’s face after jumping into his car.

He
was jailed for eight years for his part in the robbery and for 
threatening four police officers and the motorist with the firearm.

Six
years later after his release, he was convicted of pointing a gun at 
two police officers on three occasions as they followed him through city
streets.

Now having served the time, he is now challenging the conviction through the courts.

Macklin described Gordonstoun as '13 to 18 year-olds who have live among themselves and police themselves'

Principal
of the Gordonstoun School, Simon Reid, said: ‘We do not recognise the 
school that Paul Macklin is describing. Pastoral care is highly 
structured at Gordonstoun and is at the heart of everything we do.

‘Every
student at Gordonstoun has a House Master or House Mistress and tutor 
who are very involved with every aspect of their welfare.

‘Gordonstoun
works hard to make sure a culture of mutual support and kindness is 
fostered in every member of the school community.

‘We
want our students to take full advantage of the huge range of academic 
and sporting, cultural, community service and international 
opportunities on offer and they can only do that if they are happy.

‘Gordonstoun is not the tough school that the myth would have you believe.’
