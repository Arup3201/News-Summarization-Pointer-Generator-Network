Dedicated; Steven Sotloff pictured on assignment in Libya in 2013

Executed
 Steven Sotloff held joint US-Israeli citizenship but managed to hide 
his faith from his ISIS captors claims a fellow captive of the 
journalist who is now free.

The
 31-year-old kept his Judaism and his dual nationality secret from his 
ISIS kidnappers for the entire year he spent in captivity before his 
death and even managed to fast for Yom Kippur by feigning an illness.

The lengths that Sotloff went to as he practiced his faith were revealed after ISIS released grisly footage of Sotloff's beheading on Tuesday, two weeks to the day reporter James Foley was murdered in the same way by the terror group.

The
 Israeli media was aware that Sotloff had moved to Jerualem in 2008 and agreed
 to keep hidden his links to the country in case ISIS dished out brutal 
treatment to their prisoner who was kidnapped while working in Syria in 
August 2013.

'We
 refused to acknowledge any relationship with him in case it was 
dangerous for him,' said Avi Hoffman, editor of the Jerusalem Report

The
 acknowledgement that Sotloff's religion and Israeli citizenship was kept 
secret explains the huge gaps in his public biography that until yesterday went blank 
between 2005 and just before his capture as a freelancer.

During
 his captivity, Sotloff, who was devout, would use his Muslim captors 
who were praying towards Mecca to gauge where Jerusalem was for his 
daily worship the unidentified fellow captive told the Report.

Sotloff also managed to fast on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calender, which occurred in September of 2013.

'He told them he was sick and didn't want to eat,' his friend said.

Grieving: Murdered American journalist Steven Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff returns to her home in Miami on Wednesday

Sotloff, who was born in Miami, arrived in Israel in 2008 to 
become an undergraduate of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. 
according to the Times of Israel.

From
 there he went to freelance at the Jerusalem Post and the the Jerusalem 
Report and from there moved onto Foreign Policy and Time.

His editor at the Jerusalem Report in 2011-12, Illene Prusher, called him fearless.

'He was an excellent journalist, and he filed great work,' she said to the Times of Israel.

'He
 was our only guy who was filing from the region, and he was filing for a
 bunch of different places… In addition to covering Libya, he was 
covering Arab uprisings.

'I
 felt like he really cared about it, he thought it was extremely 
important. He was very conscientious, enterprising and brave.'

As a freelancer, Sotloff traveled the Arab world and eventually arrived in Syria in August, 2013.

The Times of Israel said that they knew he was Jewish, but kept it secret in case his kidnappers found out.

Sotloff wrote reports from Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Turkey and Syria.

The
 Jewish journalist - who held joint American and Israeli citizenship - 
spoke fluent Arabic and had a showed a deep love for the Islamic world 
before he was captured by ISIS militants in Syria in 2013. He was 
executed by them on Tuesday.

 31, grew up in Miami with his mother Shirley - whose parents were both 
Holocaust survivors - and father Art before attending the Kimball Union 
Academy boarding school in New Hampshire from which he graduated in 2002

He then studied at the University of Central Florida.

On Wednesday, Sotloff's mother left her Miami home without making any comment.

Shirley Sotloff briefly waved to the media outside her home in south Miami before getting into a friend's car and driven away.

The Sotloff's had received a steady stream of visitors to their home with some carrying flowers and others baskets of food.

Police have kept guard out die the home with up two patrol cars parked in the driveway.

University
 of Central Florida President John C. Hitt said on learning of his 
death: 'Our UCF family mourns Steven’s death, and we join millions of 
people around the world who are outraged at this despicable and 
unjustifiable act.'

While
 at Kimball, Sotloff was an avid rugby player and on moving to UFC began
 working for the student newspaper the Central Florida Future.

He left the paper in 2005 and began to pursue his dreams of journalism full time.

'The
 guy lit up a room. He was always such a loyal, caring and good friend 
to us,' said Josh Polsky to the New York Times. Polsky had shared a 
dormitory suite with Sotloff.

Respected:
 During his time in the Middle East, Sotloff, 31, was published in TIME,
 World Affairs, National Interest and the Christian Science Monitor

'If you needed to rely on anybody for anything he would drop everything on a dime for you or for anyone else.'

After his death on Tuesday, his friends across the world were devastated.

'A
 million people could have told him what he was doing was foolish, it 
seemed like it to us outsiders looking in, but to him it was what he 
loved to do and you weren’t going to stop him,' said his friend, Emerson
 Lotzia.

'Steve said it was scary over there. It was dangerous. It wasn’t safe to be over there. He knew it. He kept going back.'

Lotzia,
 now a Florida sports reporter, tweeted his horror after his friend’s 
execution: ‘Devastated and crushed. Steve was an amazing friend. Lucky 
to have him in my life. Heart is heavy for his family. Please keep them 
in your thoughts and prayers.’

With
 no security organizations to ensure order and an ineffective justice 
system unable to prosecute suspects, Libyans fear their country is 
slowly crumbling around them.'

During
 his time in the Middle East, Sotloff was published in TIME, World 
Affairs, National Interest, World Affairs Journal and the Christian 
Science Monitor.

Sotloff
 'is known to us as an honest and thoughtful journalist who strives to 
understand the story from local perspectives and report his findings 
straightforwardly,' World Affairs said last month.

Foreign
 Policy editor David Kenner said he would remember Sotloff 'as a brave 
and talented reporter' while colleague Tom Coghlan recalled him as 'a 
really good writer and humane journalist'.

An
 avid user of social media, he sent out his last tweet on August 3 last 
year about his hometown basketball team the Miami Heat. He is believed 
to have been kidnapped by Isis the following day.

According to his Twitter account, he was based in Benghazi, Libya, at the time.

In
 a tweet from June last year he wrote: 'Is it bad that I want to focus 
on #syria, but all I can think of is a #HEATFinals repeat?'

'Steven
 embodies what it takes to report from combat zones,' said Bill Roggio, 
managing editor of the Long War Journal, a news website for which 
Sotloff wrote in 2011 from Cairo.

'He
 has that courage and little bit of craziness that you need to take 
risks to observe and understand a story in dangerous places.'

Speaking to The Miami Herald before the apparent beheading, she insisted that Sotloff was 'no war junkie'.

He was, she said 'committed to the Arab Spring and very respectful of Islamic culture'.

Sotloff's family had previously been advised not to go public with news of his disappearance.

But a family friend wrote about Sotloff last December, saying he had gone missing on August 4 and to pray for his return.

'Steve
 Sotloff lived in Yemen for years, spoke good Arabic, deeply loved the 
Islamic world.. for this he is threatened with beheading,' friend Anne 
Marloe tweeted after the release of the first video.
