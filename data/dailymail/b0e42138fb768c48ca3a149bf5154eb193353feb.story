Children are becoming too scared to sing because they fear they will be subjected to X Factor-style ridicule, a Royal Opera House conductor has warned.

Dominic Peckham said auditions for the programme were like a '19th century freak show' that resulted in children 'crumbling' when they are asked to perform. 

Mr Peckham, who directs the Royal Opera House's youth chorus, said schools needed to do more to support children.

The X Factor has attracted a number of peculiar contestants, including Michael Jackson wannabe Michael Lewis in 2010 - but Mr Peckham fears it is making children reluctant too sing and perform

Mr Peckham said the ridicule many contestants are met with on X Factor had led to children crumbling when they are asked to perform on stage

In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, he said: 'In my experience as a youth chorus director, for years I've had children shaking their heads and just crumbling when I ask them to have a go at a song.

'You can see in their eyes that they think they are going to be no good and in many respects it's reality TV shows like The X Factor that are to blame for that.' 

'As viewers we are sponsoring a multi-million pound freak show that creates a culture where people are ridiculed for performing and expressing themselves. 

'That has now filtered down to young people who do not want to get involved with singing lessons or performing because they fear they will be laughed at.

'No one deserves that, and I have a real issue with the production companies driving us towards those freaky moments of performance. It greatly stands in the way of young people learning to sing, perform and audition.'

While Mr Peckham attacked the X Factor, he reserved some praise for the BBC's the Voice. He said the programme put greater emphasis on 'contestants' raw talent' rather than image.

The X-Factor has been widely criticised by musicians and other education experts in the past. The show is currently in its 10th year as the cornerstone of the ITV1 Saturday evening schedule. 

Musician Sting called the show 'televised karaoke', with the contestants being encouraged to 'conform to stereotypes' and saying that real musical talent was more likely to be found in pubs and clubs.

Blur singer Damon Albarn said the show created 'a mindset that suggests you can get something for nothing and that it's easy to acquire status and fame', while his band mate Graham Coxon said it was 'disgraceful'. 

At the 2009 MOBO Awards, V V Brown said: 'I don't like it - it's making kids think that they can get really famous easily, rather than working really hard to achieve something'.

James Morrison stated '[X Factor] sends out the message that you can be famous for doing f*** all and that you can succeed even if you're not a good singer'.

DJ Calvin Harris blasted the show as a 'joke' and that Cowell had a 'frightening stranglehold' of the British charts.

In a similar criticism, Noel Gallagher attacked the show for having 'absolutely nothing to do with music and everything to do with television'.

Elsewhere, psychologist Melanie Gill, who has advised the Government on child welfare, said it is impossible to know which children may be harmed by performing in front of millions of viewers.

She said: ‘It is awful that The X Factor is willing to risk the welfare of such vulnerable young people by lowering the age limit again.

‘They say they are looked after, but the reality is that their brains are not fully developed.

‘The children may look fine, but their broad grins are fake and are put on for the adults. You can’t tell what is going on inside and they don’t have the emotional strength to cope with some of the stresses a show like this brings.

‘Very often, the youngest contestants are pressured by pushy parents to compete.

‘Being humiliated in front of a mass audience and having their dreams shattered could put them at risk of depression in later life.’
