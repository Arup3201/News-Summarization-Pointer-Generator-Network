It was not so long ago that Brendan Rodgers was saying he had been made a better manager, and a better person, by Luis Suarez.

He was talking, firstly, about his unquestionable talent as a footballer but, more importantly, Rodgers referred to the inspirational power of Suarez’s personal growth last season.

So Liverpool’s manager has every right to feel cheated , as do a lot of other people. And not just cheated out of his best player for close to three months at the start of next season, either.

The consequence of Suarez’s behaviour runs far deeper than mere professional inconvenience.

FIFA
 were correct to mete out a punishment that reached beyond the 
boundaries of  international football when Suarez bit an opponent for 
the third time in his career, playing for Uruguay on Tuesday. Yet, for Rodgers, the betrayal does not stop there.

He has been personally cheated, too, because he invested emotionally in what we now know was a lie.

Like
 many in the English game, from the dressing-room to the press box, he 
was fooled into thinking he had witnessed one man’s capacity to change 
for the better.

He
 thought he had seen a journey, an epiphany, a powerful redemption. He 
thought  he was a better person, a  more valuable person, for the 
rehabilitation of Luis Suarez. He had helped. He was of use. And now it 
all seems false.

Events
 in Brazil this week will cast a shadow over the advances made by 
Liverpool last season, because it will be a while before the club can 
trust again. 

The footballer can be replaced - although not like for like - but not the faith.

All for nothing? Rodgers thought he was more valuable for rehabilitating Suarez but now it all seems false

If
 Suarez goes one month, one season, one year, unblemished, what does it 
mean, what will it matter? He will work a lifetime trying to put right 
his behaviour at this World Cup because everything he says, or does, 
from here will be met with scepticism.

No
 one will buy the sham of a reformed Suarez any more. No one will judge 
the performances, without also considering the man. For all the cant 
from several quarters about a vendetta in the British media, Suarez won 
the Football Writers’ Footballer of the Year Award at the end of last 
season, having started it suspended for biting Chelsea’s Branislav 
Ivanovic. 

As Rodgers remarked in a speech on Suarez’s behalf, it is part of British nature to forgive.

Suarez
 was a popular winner. He was respected and admired, not just for the 
exceptional quality of his play, but for his new maturity.

It
 is not just X Factor voters who are suckers for a moving back story. 
Suarez had grown from a dark soul, a player who did and said the most 
despicable things, to one who embodied the game at its finest.

He
 has always played beautifully but now had a serenity to match. No 
diving, no biting, no vile words designed to wound. He made the people 
believe. And then, when they were at their most trusting and vulnerable,
 he revealed it was all an act.

There
 will be predictable howls at FIFA’s punishment and its extension to his
 club career. Suarez, after all, was not banned from playing for 
Uruguay when suspended by the Football Association. Yet the FA is an 
organisation under the umbrella of FIFA. The  bigger body can pass its 
rulings down, the smaller body cannot pass its rulings up.

It
 is unfortunate that Liverpool, who have worked so hard at reforming 
Suarez’s unpalatable excesses, are now punished beside Uruguay - who have done nothing but indulge and excuse him, and shamefully so since last Tuesday. Yet what else was there to do?

The
 evidence was plain. If Suarez has not transgressed in English football 
since the Ivanovic incident it is only because the FA have threatened 
draconian punishment.

What option did FIFA have, then, other than to adopt the same policy?

A
 ban from international football alone would not have stopped a 
potential move to Real Madrid or Barcelona this summer. Indeed, the 
absence of regular commutes between Europe and South America would 
almost have made Suarez more appealing.

Unfortunate: Liverpool have worked hard to help reform Suarez but are now being punished

And
 what message would that send if a player who had brought the World Cup 
into disrepute then became the most expensive signing of the summer?

FIFA had to include Liverpool in their reckoning if any penalty was not to become worthless.

Is
 it enough? Some might even argue he has got off lightly. The ban from 
all competition could have lasted two years, according to FIFA’s rules. 
In the circumstances, certainly the recidivism, four months  globally 
and nine games in internationals, seems fair.

It
 is harsh enough to hurt Suarez, not so ferocious that it destroys his 
career. It leaves room for rehabilitation, enough time for the player to
 change, to grow, to be redeemed.

Whether
 anyone is interested in viewing this sequel is another matter. 
Disbelief can only be suspended so far even in horror show audiences. 
Dracula has risen from the grave? Not this time, bub.
