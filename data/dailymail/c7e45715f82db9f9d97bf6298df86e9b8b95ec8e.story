Alice Temperley has designed a new collection for John Lewis, to hit stores in September

John Lewis today announced the launch of an exciting new partnership with Alice Temperley.

The much-lauded British designer, whose intricate catwalk creations are sought after globally, has created a 60-piece debut collection for the department store that will go on sale this September.

It is to be called Somerset by Alice Temperley, the name inspired by the designer's beloved home county in the South West of England.

Temperley's debut collection for the store features womenswear and accessories and draws inspiration from classic Temperley accents, including Victoriana, bohemia, lace, military, embellishment, monochrome, chiffon, animal print and leather.

Shoppers will be able to pick up pony skin slippers, 
snakeskin belts, studded nappa leather handbags and animal print 
scarves, as well as the beautifully beaded Indian evening gowns that are
the London-based designer's trademark.

The
collection has been carefully priced to offer something to everyone - 
making it accessible to all while retaining an air of luxury.

As such, 
price points range from £29 for a scarf to £99 for a day dress, reaching
up to £1,000 for a luxurious sheepskin coat in seal grey marl.

Alice Temperley said she was 'thrilled' with her partnership with such a 'trusted British retailer'.

'We have spent the last ten years building our lines and Somerset will 
compliment our existing collections; it is a very accessible product 
that will take our aesthetic to a wider audience,' she said.

'I wanted it to be very much a 
collection of essentials and to design a collection that would provide a
feminine and functional wardrobe for women in their everyday life.

'This
collection is all encompassing, effortless and draws on our classics.'

Royal seal of approval: The Duchess of Cambridge wore Alice Temperley for the War Horse premiere earlier this year

'John Lewis is a great partner as it 
stands for quality and is a trusted staple in everyone’s lifestyle. 
Integrity is paramount and as an independent British brand, we are 
thrilled to work with a trusted British retailer.'

Jo Hooper, John Lewis's Head of Womenswear and Buying, said working with Alice provided them with a ' unique opportunity to launch and build an entirely new and exclusive brand.'

'We have worked incredibly hard on the 
quality, design and fabrication to ensure it meets the high demands of 
both Alice Temperley and John Lewis customers,' she said. 

Fans in high places: Peaches Geldof, Rosario Dawson and Pippa Middleton sat front row at the Temperley show last year

Brand & Buying Director Peter Ruis added that the collection marks a new chapter in fashion for John Lewis.

'This will be 
one of the most iconic collaborations the UK has ever seen,' he said.

The launch collection is supported by a multi-million pound advertising campaign fronted by Lily Donaldson.

Somerset by Alice Temperley will launch nationwide and online on September 4, with the second phase of partywear set to launch early October. More information on 'Somerset by Alice Temperley' can be found on www.johnlewis.com.
