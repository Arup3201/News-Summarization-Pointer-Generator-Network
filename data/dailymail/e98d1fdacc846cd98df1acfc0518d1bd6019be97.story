A heavily tattooed woman has lashed out at an Adelaide restaurant after being told she wouldn't be welcomed back if she didn't cover up next time.

Alisa Marie Giuliani, 25, was on a date at the Base bar, at the Bath Hotel in Norwood, east of Adelaide's CBD when she says she was approached by a security guard who had a word with her about her tattoos.

She has taken her disgust, following the incident to social media and says she was left feeling 'insulted' and 'upset'.

The Bath Hotel (pictured) say they didn't mean to cause any grief to the young woman but have policy and procedures to abide by

'You know what's awesome?? Paying $50 for a pizza and some cider, sitting down to enjoy your meal and the company of a lovely guy, when the security guard from the bar attached next door decides to approach you mid meal,' she posted on her Facebook page.

'He said half way through my meal and we'd been there quite while that the owners don't want people with full tattoos there,' said Ms Giuliani.

'I thought it was incredibly rude since I had been in there 15 minutes, given them my money, it was awful, poor business.'

She said her date also had tattoos and believes the comments were directed at both of them.

'I was shocked that this kind of thing happens at a bar or pup still.'

'Hundreds of people have tattoos in Adelaide, they'd be appalled to hear that happened.'

'10 years ago it was very different, I feel like discrimination like that is one step away from people with being rejected for their colour,' she said.

Ms Giuliani hit out at the Norwood hotel on social media calling them 'discriminatory jerks' and claiming they waited until after they had finished their meal to tell her.

'Do yourself a favour and boycott this s**t place,' she wrote on Facebook.

'Nobody deserves to be insulted when they're eating a meal they've paid for. And we dressed so nicely! I've never been so offended during a meal in my life. Absolute foul.'

The post received a wave of support suggesting the stance by hotel staff was very rude and many claimed it was disgusting to see a person treated in that way.

responding to some of the comments, Ms Giuliani says she had never been kicked out of a place or asked to cover her tattoos, ever, admitting she had been almost everywhere in Adelaide.

The Bath Hotel in Norwood says they hope they didn't cause Alisa Giuliani (pictured) grief but they just have to abide by policy and procedure although admit they may be behind the times

'Pathetic, I have never had problems with other guy mates who had ink in the past,' she continued on her Facebook page.

She has been humbled by the response at an incident she has labelled so ridiculous.

'So many were people horrified by it, it was shared all over Australia, shows people are shocked how sad it is,' she said

Hotel owner Tony Franzon says it unfortunate this has blown up saying the hotel simply had policy and procedure to follow.

'I think we handled it politely and not to cause the young lady any grief, we're hospitality and we need to appeal to a multiple amount of people's enjoyment,' he said.

'It's a difficult policy because everything is changing and we need to maybe look at adjusting it, to do business.'

'It's (having tattoos) become more socially acceptable than five years ago and that's a dilemma we face and the question is where do you draw the line.'

Mr Fanzon says the Bath Hotel has been a family run business for 29 years and they're certainly not here to cause anyone grief.

'The dress code is there to keep some sort of restrictions in place, unfortunately we don't allow for changing trends in fashion and maybe that's something we should review,' he said. 

Ms Giuliani hopes there will be changes and all pubs, clubs and restaurants will be less judgemental.

'Skin you can't change, it would be fantastic if the world would be more open.' 

But whether she'll consider going back there for a meal, covered up, 'definitely not'.

Ms Giuliani's Facebook friend, Ashlee Adams (pictured) had a similar experience with the same hotel years earlier and was told to leave because 'we don't allow tattooed people in here'

Ashlee Adams (pictured) also was told to leave by security at the Bath Hotel a couple of years ago because she had tattoos that were showing

The matter was made aware to South Australia's Equal Opportunity Commission who stuck up for the restaurant because it was entitled to force dress codes. 

'Dress codes, which could include restrictions on visible tattoos, are not grounds for complaint under South Australia's equal opportunity laws,' said Commissioner for Equal Opportunity Anne Gale.

'In effect, licensed venues have a right to set their own dress code,' she said. 

Another one of Ms Giuliani's Facebook friends says she also had a similar experience at the same hotel years earlier on a quiet Thursday evening.

'I was actually approached by security and rudely asked to leave midway through my meal that I had already paid for because 'we don't allow tattooed people in here',' said model Ashlee Adams.

She said after a discussion with security she was allowed to finish her dinner before being made to leave.

'It was very embarrassing and seemed a bit ridiculous considering I had been in the venue over half an hour already, had interacted with multiple staff members, spent money, and was well dressed, polite and well behaved.'

'I get having a dress code, and if they want to exclude tattooed people that's fine because it's their business and they can do what they want, but they should probably make it a little more clear and enforce that rule upon entry rather than allowing people to hand over money and order food and then asking them to leave,' she said.
