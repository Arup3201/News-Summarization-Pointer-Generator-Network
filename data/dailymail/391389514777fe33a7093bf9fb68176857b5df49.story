A piece of chewed bubblegum proves that New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez murdered his friend Odin Lloyd in an abandoned industrial park, prosecutors claim.

Hernandez, 23, was yesterday charged with shooting Lloyd five times in what was described as an 'orchestrated execution' at the disused park just minutes from his mansion in North Attleboro, Massachusetts.

Yesterday at a hearing in Attleboro District Court prosecutors said that on the night of the murder, Hernandez stopped at a gas station and bought gas, cigarettes and crucially a packet of blue cotton candy-flavoured Bubblicious bubble gum.

Murder charge: Prosecutors say a chewed piece of bubblegum can prove that football star Aaron Hernandez murdered his friend Odin Lloyd at an abandoned industrial park

Evidence: A chewed piece of bubblicious cotton candy bubble gum was found next to a spent bullet casing in the dumpster of the rental company where Hernandez had hired an SUV

Assistant District Attorney Willam McCauley told the court that the following morning, Hernandez returned the rental car to the hire company and exchanged it for a new vehicle.

The returned car was subsequently cleaned at the rental company where police went through the dumpster and discovered a bullet shell casing next to which was a chewed piece of blue cotton candy Bubblicious bubble gum.

Victim: Odin Lloyd was found dead less than a mile away from the $1.3million mansion of New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez

The casing, for a .45 calibre handgun, is understood to match those found at the scene of the crime.

Mr McCauley said that surveillance video from Hernandez's own home security cameras show two friends arriving at his $1.3million mansion with the three of them leaving at approximately 1:12 a.m., with Hernandez at the wheel.

After stopping at the gas station, Hernandez is said to have driven to nearby Dorchester where he picked up Lloyd.

Apparently, Lloyd had misgivings about the meeting and sent text messages to his family.

'Did you see who I am with?' he asked. Then he responded, cryptically, 'NFL,' prosecutor said.

Mobile phone records show that the last time Lloyd used his phone was to text his sister at around 3:23am.

He wrote 'Just so you know.'

At the moment the text was sent, 
Hernandez's car was caught on camera going down a gravel road to the 
industrial area where Lloyd's body was found before returning four 
minutes later, at 3:27 a.m.

Prosecutors claim that when Lloyd stepped out of the
 SUV, Hernandez allegedly shot him one in the chest with a .45-caliber 
pistol - knocking Lloyd to the ground.

As
 he lay on the ground, Lloyd reached up in an attempt to shield himself.
 Hernandez allegedly shot him four more times in the chest.

At 3.29am Hernandez is seen returning home with video from his own surveillance cameras allegedly showing him carrying what Mr McCauley described as a 'large black gun'.

Hearing: A member of the state's attorney's office went through the detailed evidence against Hernandez

It is believed that Hernandez, a tight end who had a $37.5million NFL contract, was angry at Lloyd because he had talked to the 'wrong people' at a nightclub.

Hernandez is being held without bail, with the judge citing the gravity of the crime as the main reason behind his decision.

Hernandez has hired two of the 
nation's top criminal defense attorneys, who maintain that the evidence 
against him is 'circumstantial.'

According to the Boston Globe,
 prosecutors revealed that Hernandez 'orchestrated' the murder of Lloyd 
because he had talked to a group of people that Hernandez 'had trouble 
with' at a Boston nightclub on Friday night.

Dead Spin reports that prosecutors have a video showing Hernandez with a handgun saying 'You can't trust anyone anymore' before making the trip to pick up Lloyd.

Prosecutors said Hernandez and his wo men picked 27-year-old Lloyd up at his house in Dorchester early Monday morning in the rented SUV.

The investigation started more than a 
week ago after semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd was found slain in an
 industrial park in North Attleborough, on the Rhode Island line not far
 from where the Patriots play.

Video emerged of Hernandez being taken 
from his home in handcuffs, which followed after Massachusetts state 
police - wearing wetsuits and armed with metal detectors - combed 
through a stream near his home yesterday.

However, the officers left 
empty-handed after turning up no new evidence in the execution-style 
murder of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd, who was reportedly last 
seen partying with Hernandez in Boston.

A Massachusetts court said yesterday it had sealed documents related to the killing of Odin.

Attleboro
 District Court officials said documents related to the case, including 
search warrants, have been impounded, meaning the public can't see them.

Trouble: The Patriots player had a connection to the victim

On
 Saturday, investigators and police canines searched Hernandez's 
$1.3million mansion for a second time. They left with several brown 
paper bags of evidence, but did not make an arrest.

Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was friends with Hernandez and was with him on Monday morning before he was shot in the head.

His
 body was dumped in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's
 luxury home in the Boston suburb of North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

Hernandez, 23, has been under intense
 media scrutiny since news of the murder broke. Police, however, have 
not named him - or anyone else - a suspect in the case.

About
 two dozen reporters, photographers and video producers were camped 
outside his house on Monday, looking for any sign of the tight end, who 
signed a $37.5million five-year contract with the Patriots last year.

According to Fox25 sources,
 a warrant was drawn up Friday morning for the arrest of Hernandez 
on a charge of obstruction of justice. But, it has not been officially 
issued or executed yet - suggesting that state police may be using it as 
bargaining chip in their talks with the defense lawyers, according to the TV station.  

Separate surveillance videos show Hernandez outside Lloyd’s home 
about an hour before the incident, and then walking into his own North 
Attleboro, Massachusetts, mansion after the shots were heard, according to the TV station.

Hernandez
 returned to his Massachusetts home Friday amid speculations of an 
impending arrest just as it was announced that he has lost an 
endorsement deal.

The 
tight end had been drinking in a Boston bar with some friends on Sunday 
night - including  Lloyd, who was found shot dead 
'execution style' hours later.

His
 body was found by a jogger in an industrial park half a mile from 
Hernandez's home. He was a semi professional football player for the 
Boston Bandits.

Amid the expanding murder 
investigation, it was announced last week that CytoSport, the maker of health 
supplements, has dropped Hernandez as the face of Muscle Milk.

‘In
 light of the investigation involving Aaron Hernandez, CytoSport is 
terminating its endorsement contract with Mr. Hernandez, effective 
immediately,’ a company statement said.

Hernandez also has an endorsement deal with Puma. The 
athletic attire giant has declined to comment on the case. 

ABC News
 reports that Hernandez's security system was 
smashed - including the surveillance videos. He also handed over his 
cell phone to investigators 'in pieces.'

This week, Hernandez was sued by his 
former friend friend and personal assistant Alexander Bradley over 
claims that he shot Bradley in the face during a fight at a Miami 
nightclub in February.

Bradley
 claims he lost one eye when a gun owned by Hernandez went off in his 
car as they drove away together following a heated argument.

five touchdowns for the Patriots.

He is spending the off-season recovering from a shoulder scope.

Hernandez,
 a University of Florida Graduate and native of Bristol, Connecticut., 
was drafted by the Patriots in 2010. He had five touchdowns for the Pats

extension, which included a $12.5 million signing bonus, the largest 
signing bonus ever given to an NFL tight end, and the second-largest 
extension ever, after teammate Rob Gronkowski's.
