Tiya Chuahan died aged 22 months after chocking on a jelly cube at Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London

Nursery staff failed to properly supervise a toddler who choked to death on a jelly cube, an inquest heard.

Tiya Chauhan, aged 22 months, fell unconscious during a ‘free flow’ play session at the Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London.

Staff did not spot Tiya had collapsed until it was ‘too late’, Westminster Coroner’s Court was told.

Matthew 
Hill, a senior officer at Ofsted, told the inquest the failure of staff 
to properly supervise play was largely responsible for Tiya’s death.

‘A child is likely to want to put it [a jelly cube] in its mouth’, he said.

Mr Hill said he did not think it was possible to supervise the children properly from the next room.

He
 said: ‘I always felt that our position, from the evidence that we had 
available, was that supervision from that room next door was not 
sufficient.’

Pressed
 by the coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox on whether the nursery had failed to 
fulfil its statutory obligation, Mr Hill replied: ‘Yes’.

‘That could be the case here, simply because Tiya managed to put something in her mouth.

‘I
 think that the conclusion that Ofsted came to is that something 
happened, there was clearly a set of circumstances at that time that 
lead to staff members not being engaged and directly supervising those 
children.

‘There certainly did not seem to be an awareness between these staff on what was due between them, in terms of their eyes being turned away from whatever was going on.

‘In Ofsted’s view there was a failure of supervision at that time and then decisions were made in terms of the ongoing registration, on that basis.’

Asked if this failure to properly supervise the children led to Tiya’s death, Mr Hill replied, ‘It certainly was a large factor in it... there was nobody there to respond to Tiya before - really - it was too late.

‘Nobody was suggesting to us that individual staff members were particularly at fault’, he added.

The toddler's father, Chetan Chauhan, wept as he gave evidence during a previous hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, which he is pictured leaving

The tragedy occurred at the nursery at around 9.40am on August 23, 2012, when the jelly was being used in a sensory game.

London Ambulance crew removed a piece of ‘jelly-like substance’ from Tiya’s airway, the inquest was told.

Tiya, who was 22-months-old, was taken by ambulance to St George’s Hospital but died later the same day.

Dicky Birds Nurseries is a family-owned business with other nurseries in Wimbledon, Raynes Park, New Malden and Surbiton.

The cause of death was asphyxiation caused by a foreign body.

The inquest continues.
