The weeping widower of a woman murdered 26 years ago testified Wednesday about a love triangle that prosecutors believe led his former lover - then a Los Angeles police officer - to kill his wife.

Defendant Stephanie Lazarus avoided the gaze of witness John Ruetten as he said he never considered Lazarus to be his girlfriend, even though they had a long sexual relationship.

'What was your understanding of the relationship?' Deputy District Attorney Shannon Presby asked.

'We were good friends,' Mr Ruetten said. 'We saw each other on and off, and on some of those occasions we had sexual intercourse.'

Staring: Lawyers outlined their cases, portraying Stephanie Lazarus, 51, seen in 2009, as either a heartbroken, jilted lover driven to kill her romantic rival or an innocent woman in a web of mishandled scientific evidence

The tall, gray-haired Mr Ruetten was overcome several times during his testimony, pulling tissues from a box on the witness stand to wipe his eyes as he spoke of Sherri Rasmussen, his murdered wife.

He also told of his friendship with Lazarus that dated back to their days as students at UCLA. There was only 'necking and fooling around' in their college years, he said.

Jurors were shown pictures of them together as college kids, including one of Mr Ruetten with his arm around Lazarus in her cap and gown at graduation.

Mr Ruetten, 53, wearing a dark business suit, testified that he met Rasmussen in 1984 at a party and they quickly became a couple.

Behind bars: Lazarus's lawyer Mr Overland said the DNA was corrupted over the decades, and a forensic dentist would testify that a bite mark does not match an impression taken of Lazarus's teeth

Resurfacing: The case was reopened in 2005 (left) and investigators followed Lazarus for months. She was finally arrested in 2009, and at the time she was a detective in the LA police department (right)

When they were engaged, he said, he felt no need to tell Lazarus because he had not seen her for months.

However,
 he said she later learned of the engagement, summoned him to her condo 
and through tears expressed her love for him. She also asked him to have
 sex with her, which he said he did but now considers a stupid move. He 
stressed that nothing changed that night.

'Here's the deal,' he said. 'It was clear she was very upset that I was getting married and moving on.'

Later,
 he said, he confessed the incident to Ms Rasmussen and told her: 'Don't
 let this mess us up. I want nothing more in the world than to be 
married to you.'

He also said he ended all contact with Lazarus, who has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Ms Rasmussen.

Mr
 Ruetten identified blissful photos of the couple's wedding on November 
23, 1985. Lazarus did not look up as the photos flashed on a courtroom 
screen.

Ms Rasmussen was killed on February 
24, 1986, bludgeoned and shot to death by an intruder at the condo where
 she and Mr Ruetten lived.

Too soon: At the time of her death, Rasumssen (pictured) had been married to Lazarus' former lover for 4 months

Prosecutors are trying to show that Lazarus sought revenge for being spurned by Mr Ruetten.

Another
 witness, retired Los Angeles police officer Mike Hargreaves, said he 
lived at Lazarus' condo for a year and recalled that she woke him once 
in the middle of the night and said Mr Ruetten had broken up with her.

'She said John told her he was going to marry someone else,' Mr Hargreaves said.

He said Lazarus, who was exceptionally fit, suggested they do 'buddy sit-ups' together and she felt better after that.

Mr Ruetten's sister, Gail Lopes, showed jurors a letter to her mother from Lazarus that was postmarked August 6, 1985.

In
 it, Lazarus told Mrs. Ruetten: ''I'm truly in love with John and the 
past year has really torn me up. I wish it didn't end the way it did, 
and I don't think I'll ever understand his decision. '

In
 subsequent years, Lazarus married and adopted a daughter. She rose to 
the rank of detective and was honored for her work in the art forgery 
section.

She was arrested in
 2009 after forensic experts, examining the file on Rasmussen's murder, 
linked her DNA to a bite mark on the slain woman's arm.
