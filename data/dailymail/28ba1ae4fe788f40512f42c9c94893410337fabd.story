His dazzling skills once lit up world football, and former Argentina player and manager Diego Maradona showed he hasn't lost his silky touches.

Maradona, 53, was invited to the stage by French Guiness World Record freestyler Wassim Benslimane, before being asked to join the juggler in some kick-ups.

Dressed in a grey suit, and in shoes not ideally suited to football, Maradona, considered by some to be the greatest player of all time, showed glimpses of his incredible talent.

Skills: Maradona showed he still has some of the ability that made him one of the world's greats

Tricks and flicks: The former Argentina star pulled off some nice touches at the freestyle event

In control: the 53-year-old still has an excellent first touch, but was eventually outshone by his partner

At one point he juggled the ball against the floor using the soles of his feet, as well as demonstrating a first touch that would be the envy of many current professionals.

Benslimane, however, stole the show, swinging the ball around his neck before doing kick-ups lying down and then tricking his partner into trying to trip him.

Maradona, who spent two years in charge of Argentina before an unsuccesful 2010 World Cup, won the tournament as a player in 1986, when he also scored his infamous 'hand of god' goal against England.
