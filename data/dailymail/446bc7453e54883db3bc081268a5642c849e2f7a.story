A holidaymaker who was delayed for more than 27 hours is taking on the aviation industry in a landmark case which could pave the way for millions of compensation claims against airline giants.

Ron Huzar, 58, from Offerton, Stockport, started legal action against airline Jet2 after his flight from Manchester
 to Malaga was severely delayed in October 2011 due to a wiring defect.

But despite Mr Huzar claiming that the delay was within the airline's control, Jet2 has refused to pay up - and instead took Mr Huzar's claim all the way to the High Court.

Ron Huzar, 58, from Offerton, Stockport, brought legal action against 
airline company Jet2 after his flight to Malaga from Manchester was 
delayed by 27 hours - but it refused to pay up

Now Mr Huzar is waiting to see whether the court sides with his argument, in a case which experts claim could affect the 'entire airline industry'.

Mr Huzar said: 'This is going to become a much bigger issue because I believe they have been getting away with it.'

If the ruling is made in Mr Huzar's favour, experts warn it could open the floodgates for complaints from up to 2.6million delayed customers a year

Mr Huzar, a company director, decided to sue the airline after he waited for more than a day for his flight with his wife and 12-year-old granddaughter.

The father-of-three issued legal proceedings but his compensation claim was turned down at Stockport County Court.

Mr Huzar refused to give up and successfully appealed the decision at Manchester County Court.

But Jet2 also lodged an appeal, citing 'ambiguity' in EU regulations for why it was avoiding paying out the compensation.

Jet2 has blamed the lack of 'clarity' in EU regulations for why it has not paid any compensation to Mr Huzar. A decision in Mr Huzar's favour would rule out a 'technical difficulty' as a circumstance beyond the airline's control

Now, the case is due to be heard at the High Court - the highest court at which the case can be dealt with in this country.

Current regulations allow passengers to claim compensation if a flight is delayed by more than three hours.

The only time that is not allowed is if the delay is caused by an ‘extraordinary circumstance’.

The
 delay to the Manchester-bound flight was caused by a wiring defect in a
 fuel valve circuit, which Mr Huzar claims is not 'extraordinary'.

Mr
 Huzar said technical faults were ‘inherent in the running of an 
aircraft’ and should therefore be considered as within the airline's 
control.

It means the case is key because it will rule out a 'technical defect' as an extraordinary circumstance.

Mr Huzar said: 'It was a total disaster from start to finish.

'Airlines are using the extraordinary circumstances argument to avoid paying out compensation.'

Kevin Clarke, an aviation lawyer at Bott & Co in Wilmslow, said the judgment would ‘set a binding precedent'.

Regulation (EC) 261/2004 requires airlines compensate passengers if their flight is cancelled or delayed.

Initially, the regulation only covered cancelled flights, but a European Court of Justice ruling in 2009 said it could apply to any delays of more than three hours.

The rules can apply to any person leaving on a flight from an EU airport, or anyone arriving at an EU airport on an EU airline.

Customers can also claim back for flights which were delayed up to six years ago.

But the delay has to be a minimum of three hours.

Customers are also only entitled to compensation if the delay was deemed to have been within the airline's control. It cannot be what is called 'extraordinary circumstances'.

The regulation does not give precise examples of what these extraordinary circumstances are but staff shortage and aircraft unavailability is deemed to be within the airline control.

Bad weather or an 'Act of God' is not deemed to be.

A technical difficulty has proved to be a grey area, with some rejected by an airline and others not.

The compensation is for the delay, not for the cost of the price ticket. It means the refund will be a standard figure, regardless of how much the ticket cost. 

He argued that the extraordinary circumstances clause was for events like the volcanic ash cloud crisis of 2010.

He said: 'The airlines are insisting on twisting what should be a very straightforward point of law.

'In Germany and Holland there have been thousands of cases settled over this very issue.

'It is widely accepted there that a technical defect is not an extraordinary circumstance under the terms of the regulation.

'This is just another instance of the airlines dragging their heels, using every excuse not to pay out to consumers.'

A Jet2 spokesman said: 'As EU legislation on passenger rights currently stands, neither customers nor the airline industry have clarity on the situation.

'We regret this ambiguity, which has caused so much confusion for travellers.

'This case, which could have a significant impact on the entire airline industry, shows that there are no easy answers.

'That’s why we are appealing the judge’s decision and are supporting the ongoing review of EC 261 to make the air travel rules fairer, clearer, and simpler to apply.

'Jet2.com’s focus is always on providing high levels of service at great prices and we take complaints very seriously.

'When unprecedented disruptions do occur, our priority is to make sure our customers reach their destination as soon as possible.'

For a three-hour flight of up to 150km, the compensation is generally expected to be £220.

For up to 3,500km, the refund would generally be expected to be £350.
