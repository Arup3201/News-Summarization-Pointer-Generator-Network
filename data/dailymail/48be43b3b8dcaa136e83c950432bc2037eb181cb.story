Michael Clarke has been named as Australia captain for the World Cup after the co-hosts announced their 15-man squad late on Saturday night.

The 33-year-old has been ruled out of the start of the six-week tournament — including his side’s opener against England in Melbourne on February 14 —following surgery on a hamstring injury.

But Clarke was still named in Australia’s squad, with the expectation he will return at some stage during the first round.

Steve Smith has been in sensational form while deputising for Clarke as Test captain, hitting centuries in four successive matches against India.

Yet George Bailey is expected to retain the vice-captaincy of the one-day side, meaning the Tasmanian will initially lead Australia at the World Cup.

Australia narrowly missed out on securing victory in the final Test against India in Sydney yesterday, with the tourists holding on for a draw after finishing the final day on 252 for seven in their second innings.

Meanwhile, Mike Hussey will not face England in their second tour match in Canberra on Wednesday.

The former Australia batsman was named captain of the Prime Minister’s XI but has been ruled out after injuring his calf playing for Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash on Friday evening.
