Hundreds of vintage enthusiasts turned back time this weekend and re-lived the rocking 1950s during the Rhythm Riot vintage festival.

The twice annual event is held at Pontins Holiday Park in Camber, East Sussex, and is nothing short of heaven for fans of the fashion, music and cars of the period.

Live Rockabilliy, Blues and Rock 'n' Roll is played throughout the three-day festival, with performances from swing bands also providing top entertainment.
