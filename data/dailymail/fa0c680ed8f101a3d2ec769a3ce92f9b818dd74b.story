This is the moment a benefits cheat who swindled £10,000 by claiming he could only walk 10 yards was caught on camera playing a round of golf.

Gordon Grear, 55, told authorities he could not walk further than 10 yards due to arthritis before being secretly filmed playing 18 holes in a charity golf tournament at Longhirst Hall Golf Club, near Morpeth in Northumberland.

Grear, from Blyth, Northumberland, does suffer from genuine medical problems due to his arthritis and began claiming legitimately from the Department for Work and Pensions in 1998.

However, he submitted a form last year saying his condition had worsened and went on to falsely claim £9,619.

Gordon Grear told authorities he could not walk further than 10 yards due to arthritis before being  filmed playing 18 holes in a charity golf tournament at Longhirst Hall Golf Club, near Morpeth in Northumberland

The 55-year-old claimed he could only walk up to 10 yards 'at best' but was seen walking unaided on the golf course in July last year. Investigators secretly filmed him covering 18 holes on the 6,446 yard golf course 

He ticked a box on the form to confirm he could only walk up to 10 yards 'at best', but was caught weeks later walking nearly 6,500 yards across a golf course during the Help for Heroes fundraiser.

A few weeks later, in July last year, he also went on to take part in and subsequently win The Three Castles Golf Tournament, which involved him playing on three consecutive days at Alnwick, Bamburgh and Dunstanburgh, in Northumberland.

Alec Burns, prosecuting at Newcastle Crown Court today, said: 'Observations were being made of him and he was recorded playing golf.

'He did 18 holes covering 6,446 yards in just over three hours.

'The defendant also won a golf tournament, having played three consecutive day of golf.'

Grear, who is married, was interviewed by investigators and said he had been told to play golf by his doctor after a knee replacement operation failed.

Mr Burns said: 'He said his condition had worsened and he was in constant pain.

'He was then shown the CCTV recording and he eventually accepted he could walk unlimited with proper pain medication.'

Grear said he had been told to play golf by his doctor after a knee replacement operation failed. However, he admitted he had failed to notify the authorities of change in his circumstances at Newcastle Crown Court

Grear pleaded guilty to failing to notify a change of circumstances and thereby claiming £9,619 he was not entitled to.

After the case, Grear said he had not deliberately fleeced the taxpayer and claimed the form asked how far he could walk without discomfort. He said he could only walk any distance or play golf after taking strong painkillers.

He said: 'There's a lot more to this than was said in court.

'I've had a back problem since a girder fell on me in a pit in 1985 and my knee was damaged playing football when I was younger.

'My knee collapsed and I fell on glass and the knee replacement went wrong, I've got a brace on my leg for the rest of my life.

'I would never deliberately defraud the taxpayer.

'The golf event at Longhirst was for the Help the Heroes charity and I felt I had to do it. There was no golf buggy available there but I did use a buggy for The Three Castles event.

'Four surgeons told me to get exercise and I was following their advice.

'I've had 11 operations and I've got two more operations to come, on my hip and shoulder.

'I've given up golf now.'

Grear was speaking after being given an 18-week suspended prison sentence with a £1,500 fine.

Recorder Davies, who had remanded him in the court cells for an hour over lunch, told him: 'Offences like this are particularly serious at a time when there is an effort to reduce the expenses on the public purse and reduce benefits being paid where they should not be paid.

'When people are suffering a reduction in living standards and income, it's particularly galling for honest people to see someone like you overpaid by such an enormous sum of money.

'You couldn't complain if I sent you immediately to prison today but there is force in the mitigation that you didn't do this dishonestly from the outset and it's right to reflect in the sentence that you do genuinely have very significant disabilities and have had medical problems for many years.'

Grear will now face a proceeds of crime hearing as the DWP tries to claw back the money.

Jonathan Pigford, defending, said: 'This is not a man with a luxurious lifestyle and there is no suggestion he has benefitted in that sense.

'His health problems are genuine and serious, he has supplied numerous pieces of paperwork going back to 1998.

'There has been surveillance of him over four months and the crucial part is a golf tournament he took part in. He says he takes a significant amount of medication and he has been advised by his doctor to exercise.

'He now has to wear a brace on his knee permanently, having almost fallen into the path of a vehicle when his knee collapsed.

'He maintains he can't walk for 10 metres before he feels discomfort. He says, in a somewhat glib comment, that he can walk forever on the medication.'
