Two brothers have been charged with sexually assaulting a boy who passed out after drinking at a party for the high school football team.

Joseph Resetarits, 18, and Anthony Resetarits, 20, were arrested separately last Thursday in Homer and Anchorage, Alaska.

The brothers face charges of felony sexual assault for sexual penetration of an incapacitated person.

The younger brother attends Homer High School and was a member of the Mariners football team until his dismissal on Thursday.

Anthony Resetarits lists his profession as a commercial fisherman.

Police were alerted to the assault by a 
nurse at a Homer hospital on September 10, according to a complaint filed in Homer Superior 
Court.

The party started late on Saturday, September 8 and continued into the next morning.

The boy arrived at the party about 10 
pm, and witnesses said he was drinking heavily. He passed out on a couch about an hour later.

The party quickly grew from a few invited guests to as many as 80 people, including many members of the Homer Mariners football team.

Some of the people at the party began
taking turns writing on the boy's body with markers before Anthony 
Resetarits shaved an 'M' into the boy's hair, an apparent reference to 
the team, it was reported.

Later, the boy's pants and underwear were removed and he was sexually assaulted, according to witnesses.

Numerous photographs were seized 
by troopers, including one showing the assault. The faces of the males 
conducting the assault aren't shown, but one teenage boy who provided the photo identified the brothers.

Friends later delivered the unconscious boy to his mother.  The teenager has 
not been named.

Fourteen high school athletes were
suspended for being at a party where alcohol is served, a violation of 
Alaska Student Activities Association ruled.

More charges could be filed as troopers continue to investigate, said spokeswoman Beth Ipsen.

The brothers were arraigned on Friday, said Kenai Assistant District Attorney Kelly Lawson.

It wasn't immediately clear if the brothers had lawyers ahead of their arraignments. Online court records did not list an attorney for either on Friday morning.

The school played Thunder Mountain High School in Juneau on Friday night in a state playoff semifinal game.

'We are working with district administration to determine the exclusion of any student involved not only from school activities, but our school campus,' Homer High School Principal Allan Gee said.
