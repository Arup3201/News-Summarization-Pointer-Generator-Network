A husband and wife are accused of raping their 13-month-old daughter during what was supposed to be a supervised visit at a children's service center, and recorded it on a cellphone - which also contained 532 images of child bestiality.

Felicia and Cody Beemer, from Trumbull County, Ohio, originally pleaded not guilty to the charges. But yesterday, Cody, 23, changed his plea to guilty on charges of rape, gross sexual imposition and four counts of pandering obscenity involving a minor.

It also emerged that he previously raped his 18-month-old nephew while they were babysitting him, which was also taped on the phone. He also pleaded guilty to that charge.

He was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 25 years on the rape charge. All other sentences will run along with the most stringent sentence.

It was when an older relative found the SIM card with the footage on it that she turned it over to police.

When they investigated, as well as the footage of the children being raped, police also found 532 images of minors either involved in or watching a 'montage of obscenity and bestiality', the indictment states.

Judge Andrew Logan said: 'This is one of
the most outrageous and despicable acts that has ever come before this 
court. We're talking about children of tender ages, newborns really 
abused in the most outrageous manner.'

Warren Law Director Greg Hicks said: 'The child is and has been in the custody of Children Services and during a scheduled visitation they are alleged to have raped the child.

'There are other allegations which we are
investigating, that there may in fact be more charges on one or both of
these individuals involving minors.'

Mother: Felicia Beemer has had four of her children taken off her, all as soon as they were born, but was allowed to scheduled visits with them, which is when she is alleged to have raped one of them

The 13-month-old daughter was taken away from the couple as soon as she was born and there is currently an investigation underway as to how they were able to harm her during a supervised visit.

Children's Services Board acknowledged they had relaxed the 
supervised visitation for the Beemers prior to the rape and caseworkers were checking in on them only in 'timed 
intervals' during the weekly two-hour-long visits, according to The Tribune Chronicle.

Questions are also being asked about why Cody Breemer was even allowed on the premises as he is a registered sex offender.

He sexually assaulted a three-year-old girl when he was a teenager, which CSB were aware of.

In the wake of this investigation, CSB executive director Nick Kerosky has resigned.

Felicia Beemer, 21, cried when she appeared in Warren County court.

She has had three other children removed from her care in the past,  including one-and-a-half-year-old Tiffany Sue Banks, who was murdered by foster mother Bonnie Pattison.

Her trial is pending.
