A down-and-out actor sent extortion letters to several celebrities, including film stars and coal tycoons, according to court documents.

An affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun claims that 25-year-old Vivek Shah was registered for handgun training classes in Los Angeles, and that he mailed letters to several affluent individuals demanding hefty sums of cash.

The Los Angeles resident was arrested at his parents’ Chicago-area home on August 10th, and is currently in custody in lieu of a detention hearing.

While none of the alleged victims are named, the Smoking Gun designates a 60-year-old man who lives in Connecticut as famed movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

A spokesman for Harvey Weinstein did not immediately respond to request for comment.

In addition, The Smoking Gun says other letters were sent out to Helen Mirren’s estate and to the home of Florida coal magnate Christopher Cline.

It was the threatening letter sent to Mr Cline that started the police’s investigation. Postal inspector Joshua Mehall testified in an affidavit that a $13million extortion letter was sent to the billionaire’s home.

Shah allegedly threatened to kill his family members if the sum was not deposited in an off-shore bank account in Cyprus, Mr Mehall said. Mr Cline, the owner of Foresight Reserves, is worth an estimated $1.5billion, Forbes magazine writes.

When federal agents looked into the threat made to Mr Cline, they discovered several other similar threats made to the wealthy elite. 

Agents were able to trace postage stamp and debit card purchases back to Shah, who was also allegedly caught on camera in a Los Angeles-area Rite Aid near his apartment buying prepaid debit cards which were then used in the extortion.

They also found a Google account opened with a pseudonym, Ray Amin, the same name as a fake California driver’s licence that he carried on him.

Typecast: Shah, right, was also cast in a 2010 Intel advert where he and a fellow actor argued over how to cut a cake

On his IMDb page, Shah is pictured with a host of A-list celebrities, including Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie, and Steve Buscemi.

His IMDb biography says that he was born in Akron, Ohio, and had several brief and often un-credited roles in TV shows like Outsourced, Bones, and Animal Witness. He also appeared briefly in 2008’s The Dark Knight as a bank hostage.

Shah also appeared in a 2010 Intel ad, where he and another man – Intel programmers – are arguing where to cut a cake shaped like an Intel processor.
