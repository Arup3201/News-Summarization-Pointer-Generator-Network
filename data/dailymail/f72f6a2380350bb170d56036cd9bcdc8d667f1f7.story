Chelsea defender Ashley Cole and Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick will not be on the plane to Rio with the rest of the World Cup squad next month, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

England manager Roy Hodgson will announce his World Cup squad tomorrow with a dramatic cull of ageing stars as he turns to youth for this summer’s campaign.

Hodgson has chosen a 23-man squad packed with young legs to cope with the soaring temperatures and sweltering humidity of Brazil. The team’s oldest members will be Frank Lampard, 35, and Steven Gerrard, 33.

Cole, 33, once seen as one of England’s ‘golden generation’, has struggled to get into Chelsea’s first team this season.

He will be replaced by Southampton left-back Luke Shaw, 18, who has garnered critical acclaim for his performances this season and become a multimillion-pound target for Manchester United.

Carrick, 32, will be forced to make way for Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, 20, tipped as one of the future stars of the squad.
