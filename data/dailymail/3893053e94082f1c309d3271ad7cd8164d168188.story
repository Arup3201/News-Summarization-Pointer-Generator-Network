A mother who spent £40,000 turning her home into a cafe could lose the property after planning permission for her business was refused.

Kym McKenzie, 52, had hoped to be able to pay for her son Ramoan, 15, to go to university with takings from the garden cafe opened at her home in Southampton, Hampshire.

She had hoped to capitalise on trade from the nearby Millbrook Trading Estate and claims that she only began work in April last year when she was told by councillors that she didn't need planning permission.

At a loss: Kym McKenzie, 52, spent more than £40,000 converting her home into a garden cafe, but could now lose her property after being denied planning permission

High hopes: Ms McKenzie, pictured inside the cafe, had hoped to put her son Ramoan, also pictured, through university with proceeds from the cafe

But she faces financial ruin after her application was refused due to a lack of safe pedestrian access.

Ms McKenzie is now unable to keep with repayments on her business loan.

She had proposed that access would be via a gate in the garden fence, which would open on to a privately owned grass verge.

But the council said it was not clear if delivery vehicles would be able to access the cafe without having a harmful impact on her neighbours.

Empty: Work on the cafe was completed in December last year, but Ms McKenzie is yet to serve a customer

Ms McKenzie said: 'I have been given no real hope that it can open. I just don’t want to lose my home.

'If they said to me I can open next week, I could have this finished and ready to go.

'I went round to all the companies here and they said they would order food from me all the time.'

Southampton City Council denies Ms McKenzie's claims that she was told she wouldn't need planning permission for business use and says that it advises people not to begin building work until an application has been successful.

The conversion of her home was completed last Christmas but nine months later Ms McKenzie's business is yet to open.

Kym’s Garden Cafe has been fitted out with thousands of pounds of kitchen goods including new tables, chairs, chilling cabinets and cooking equipment.

Her business idea was supported by Southampton Test MP Alan Whitehead.

He said: 'This was a good idea for the area and a good idea for her.

'Having got that far down the line, if anything can be done to get over the final hurdle then it should be done.'
