Ariel Castro taunted the mother of one of his victims by calling her up on the girl’s cell phone - and saying she was his ‘wife’ now.

The Today Show aired FBI interview tapes from his first interrogation which reveal that the Cleveland kidnapper phoned Amanda Berry’s mom Louwana Miller - who died in 2006 of a broken heart - but hung up before she could ask any questions.

Castro also revealed how he was once nearly caught by a girlfriend in 2002 at the start of his kidnapping when she saw a TV on upstairs in his House of Horrors in Ohio.

Confession: Police released footage of their interrogation with Cleveland Kidnapper Ariel Castro today. Castro committed suicide earlier this week by hanging himself with a bed sheet in his prison cell

Breakdown: In the interrogation, Castro shows no remorse for his crimes but does start to cry a few times

Taunting: Castro says he called the mother of Amanda Berry to tell her that Amanda was now his 'wife'

After claiming that his three victims were to blame for their own abduction he curses himself for ‘letting my guard down’ by leaving a bedroom door open which allowed them to escape.

Castro, 53, hanged himself with a bed sheet on Tuesday night in his cell at the Corrections Reception Center in Orient, near Columbus.

He had served just 33 days of a 1,000 year sentence for keeping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight captive for a decade.

'I let my guard down': Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry escaped Castro's imprisonment when he accidentally left a bedroom door unlocked this past May

The former school bus driver starved his victims and got Michelle pregnant at least five times weeks before punching her stomach until she miscarried.

He also fathered a child with Amanda, a girl of six who has now lost her father, and brainwashed them by pretending to leave the house and battering them if they tried to escape.

The interview took place soon after his arrest in May and lasts for four hours during which time he expresses no remorse but sometimes breaks down in tears.

Wearing handcuffs and a long sleeved black top, he is questioned by two police agents who take notes throughout.

Castro does not say exactly when he phoned Louwana but his recollection of the call is chilling.

He says: ‘I think I said something...that I have her daughter and that she's okay and that she's my wife now - something like that, you know, probably not the exact words’.

The call would have been before 2006 - he abducted Amanda in 2003 - because that year Louwana died at the age of 43.

Strange: On the day he was sentenced, Castro gave an odd speech saying most of the sex he had with the three women was consensual

She had been in hospital for pancreatitis but relatives have said she never recovered from her daughter’s abduction.

On the tapes Castro reveals how as the years went by his daughter born by Amanda asked him not to lock the doors in his house - something he did obsessively to keep them captive.

There were however near misses, such as when he abducted Gina in April 2004.

Castro says that there were surveillance cameras at her school that should have captured him 15 minutes before he grabbed her and that detectives ‘could have broke the case right then and there’.

Another near miss happened in 2002 when he invited a girlfriend back to his house. By then he had abducted Michelle, his first victim.

Castro says on the interrogation video that the girlfriend had ‘seen that I had a TV on in the upstairs room’.

He said: ‘And she says: ‘What is that? You have a TV on up there?’ And my heart started beating, and I was like, ‘Okay, she's probably catching onto something.’

Almost caught: Castro says he was almost caught in 2002 when he brought a girlfriend over to the house and she noticed a TV on upstairs in a bedroom where Michelle Knight was locked. His house has since been demolished

Taste of his own medicine: Michelle got the opportunity to confront her captor in court on the day he was sentenced to 1,000 years in prison - saying his hell was just beginning

At the time of their disappearances Amanda was 16, Gina was 14 and Michelle was 21.

They are now 27, 23 and 32 respectively.

Their ordeal came to an end on May 6 when Miss Berry banged on the front door of their captivity house and a neighbor pulled it open.

The police tapes reveal that Castro was angry at himself for allowing it to happen by accidentally leaving a bedroom door open.

He tells investigators: ‘I know I let my guard down’.

The police tapes include sections in which Castro talks about how he kidnapped his victims, but NBC has chosen not to air these out of respect for the girls.

They have also not aired parts in which he says how they should not have got into his car and that what happened to them should be a lesson to other children.

Whilst in jail Castro wrote a Father’s Day letter to his own children in which he says: ‘I still can’t believe what I did to put me in the situation that I’m in now’.

In 2004 he also wrote a separate note in which he talked of committing suicide and says: ‘I want to put an end to my life and let the devil deal with me.

'Let the devil deal with me': According to notes found in Castro's home, he  had previously written about committing suicide. He followed through with that thought on Tuesday when he hanged himself in his prison cell

‘I just want to crash through the window’.

An investigation is now underway into how Castro was able to kill himself in prison.

His lawyers have claimed the prison refused a suicide evaluation even though he was obviously disturbed.
