Two sisters travelling to their father's funeral died when their car was hit by a freight train after becoming 'distracted by grief at a level crossing.

The tragedy happened near the Russian city of Kursk as Natalia Lahova, 63, and her sister Lioudmila, 60, were travelling to the funeral of their father Artem.

Artem, 87, a veteran of the Second World War, was being buried with full military honours when the accident happened.

A police spokesman said: 'We have CCTV footage from the scene and it looks like both women failed to notice that a train was bearing down at the spot where they were crossing.

'The train was going at over 90 kph. The women's car was struck full on. There was nothing anyone could do for them.'

Emergency medics arrived ten minutes after the impact but both sisters had been killed instantly.

A police spokesman said a full investigation will be carried out.

'The witnesses of the accident think that it must have been the grief of the women which caused them not to notice the danger,' said the spokesman.

'Their father was a hero of the Great Patriotic War against the Germans and it is a shame they did not get to say goodbye to him before their untimely deaths.'
