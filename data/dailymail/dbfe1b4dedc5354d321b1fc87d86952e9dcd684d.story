The number of children being educated in primary schools of at least 800 pupils has risen almost fourfold in three years.

About 52,000 youngsters are currently taught in these ‘titan’ primaries, compared with 13,700 in 2010.

And 5,350 are squeezed into primary schools with more than 1,000 pupils, according to data released by the Department for Education under the Freedom of Information Act.

Not a single primary school across England housed so many children in 2010.

The rise in super-size primaries comes amid a school place crisis which this September left councils struggling to cope with the huge influx of pupils.

The Daily Mail revealed how youngsters were packed ‘like sardines’ into oversized classes, with former police stations and even factory car parks used for lessons.

A baby boom that began more than a decade ago, rising immigration and hard-up parents opting out of the private sector have been blamed for the problem.

DfE data shows ‘titan’ primary schools have become a common way to cope with spiralling pupil numbers following a lack of forward planning under Labour. 

This is despite the fact that parents and education experts fear children as young as four become ‘lost’ in these extra large schools.

Between January 2012 and January this year, numbers of pupils in 800-plus primaries rose by 48 per cent. The number in schools of more than 1,000 children more than doubled, from 2,100 to 5,350 over the same period.

There are 58 primary schools currently educating 800 or more pupils, including five that have more than 1,000. There were just 16 with 800 or more in 2010.

Other data released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed Labour repeatedly ignored warnings about the looming primary school crisis. In 2007, councils were told to slash surplus places and close schools despite the Labour government’s pupil estimates indicating a rapidly increasing primary population.

A Daily Mail survey found that one in three councils launched extra reception classes this September – part of a raft of emergency measures.

Barking and Dagenham council, East London, even admitted it was considering three-day weeks.

Professor Alan Smithers, of Buckingham University, said ‘titan’ schools may make economic sense but do not pay ‘sufficient regard to the development of our children’, adding that they can be ‘overwhelming’.

The Local Government Association found some parts of England could see nearly twice as many pupils as places in two years.
