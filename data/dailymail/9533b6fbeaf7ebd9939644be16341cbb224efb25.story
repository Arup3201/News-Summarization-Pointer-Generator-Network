Accused: Alicia Inglish has been arrested on 120 counts of suspected animal cruelty and tampering with evidence

An animal rescue boss has been arrested after police raided a shelter and found 149 starving dogs living in filthy conditions.

Alicia Inglish, 24, had been taking in unwanted pets and running Willamette Animal Rescue centre from a warehouse in Marion County, Oregon, in the U.S.

But police became concerned about the welfare of the animals after complaints from people who adopted dogs.

They found many piled up on top of each other in tiny carriers with waste dripping down from one to another.

As many as five dogs were crowded into a living area only fit for one.

Officers said there was just two bags of dog food in the entire building.

The dogs appeared to be mainly surviving on stale bread.

Many of the them were said to be severely malnourished and what little water was available was contaminated with rubbish.

Some of the dogs' eyes were sealed shut with bodily fluids while others had open sores and bald patches on their coats.

A team of 21 officers and volunteers worked through the night after the raid on Sunday to remove the dogs and assess them.

The Oregon Humane Society took in 110 dogs.

Many of the dogs were found living in cages usually used to transport animals

'This is so far and away from the perception of warmth and caring people expect in an animal shelter,' Sharon Harmon, executive director of the Oregon Humane Society, told The Oregonian. 'This is just a tragic case of neglect.'

Inglish has been arrested on 120 accusations of second-degree animal neglect and tampering with evidence.

She was reportedly arrested on Sunday morning as she pulled up to the warehouse with another four dogs.

On the group's Facebook page, which has since taken down, a plea had been posted appealing for dog food on November 10.

According to The Oregonian, it read: 'We go through about 120 pounds of 
dog food each day at the shelter so gift cards to Costco, Petsmart and 
Petco are always a big help!'

A former volunteer at the center, Christian Kidd, 23, defended Inglish saying she had been takin gin dogs from a local pound that would otherwise have been euthanized.

'We would pick up dogs sentenced to death and bring them back to rehabilitate them and try to find them loving homes,' said Kidd.

'She didn't want the dogs to die. That's all she cared about.'

Inglish is being held at the Marion County Jail on Â£190,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court this afternoon.

Marion County Sheriff's office said additional arrests are expected.
