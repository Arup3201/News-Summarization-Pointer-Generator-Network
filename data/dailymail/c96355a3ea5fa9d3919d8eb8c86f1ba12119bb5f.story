New York police officers were handing out flyers to people around New York City on Saturday urging them to upgrade their devices to Apple's new iOS7 operating system.

NYPD's Public Awareness Notice promotes the software as giving 'added security to your devices'.

The NYPD notice also urges people to register their devices with their 'Operation Identification Program'.

One
 of those given a flyer was Michael Hoffman, who posted a picture on his Twitter account showing the paper from the police that was given to him
 at his subway stop.

Attention: NYPD are handing out flyers urging people to download Apple's new iOS7 software

His tweet says: 'Four uniformed NYPD officers were at my subway stop tonight asking me to upgrade to iOS 7. Not a joke!'

The message of the NYPD flyer reads: 'By downloading the new operating system, should your device get lost or stolen, it cannot be reprogrammed without an Apple ID or password.'

The police are referring to the new iOS 7 security features, which include
 a Find My iPhone Activation Lock that asks for an Apple ID and a 
password before the feature can be disabled.

If a phone is stolen, the thief can't stop the original owner 
from being able to locate it. It will also prevent people from deleting 
data from the handset.

The software also promotes security through fingerprint recognition.

Safety first: Police in New York say the new software can help people if their devices are stolen or lost

The new iPhone 5s has a built-in fingerprint scanner that reads a users' prints using the home button.

Touch ID replaces an App Store password when buying music, apps or books.

It
 uses a 'laser cut sapphire crystal' to take a high-res image scan and 
the Touch ID software in iOS 7 determines whether the print belongs to 
the owner or not.

Apple 
reassured users that the feature is secure by explaining 'all fingerprint 
information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip' 
adding the prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to 
iCloud.

According to one comment on Gawker, 'the NYPD getting the word out about iOS 7 is a GOOD THING for EVERYONE'.

'Less petty theft for the NYPD to be diverting resources to (they have a dedicated iPhone theft task force), less of your iPhones getting stolen. iPhone theft is a VERY well-documented problem in NYC,' said the person using the name, Jaro.

Apple customers worldwide
 have been able to download the company’s latest operating system since September 18.

It is being hailed as a new beginning for the firm.

Everything
 from email to the calendar, texts, phone keypad, photos and notes look 
and work differently on the software.

Importantly,
 traditional icons have been scrapped under the redesign masterminded by 
Apple's British design chief Sir Jonathan Ive.

 to make the iPhone appear bigger, with features deliberately designed 
to take advantage of the entire screen. Text on iOS 7 appears sharper 
than on iOS 6, pictured left

Apple's iOS 7 software includes a new feature called Airdrop that lets users share photos, video and contacts simply by clicking share and selecting a fellow iOS 7 user from a contacts list

Ive introduced iOS 7 as an 'important
 new direction' when he showcased the software at Apple’s annual 
Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco earlier this year.

The
 operating system has a cleaner look than its predecessors and has been 
described by Apple’s CEO Tim Cook as 'the biggest change to iOS since 
the introduction of the iPhone.'

Its launch last week coincides with the release of two new iPhones which went on sale on Friday.

Apple's iPhone 5S is a high-end model that has a fingerprint scanner built into the phone's home button.

It also comes with a 64-bit chip designed to make switching between 
apps and using the handset and software smoother and faster.

Apple's iOS 7 has been designed to
 make the iPhone appear bigger.

Its features are deliberately designed to 
take advantage of the entire screen on iPhones and iPads.

This
 has been criticised as Apple's attempt to rival phones with larger, 
five-inch and upward screens including Samsung's Galaxy S4 and the Note
 3.

Text on iOS 7 
appears sharper, while a Control Centre on the phone allows users to 
adjust settings with just one swipe from of the screen.

information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip' 
adding the prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to 
iCloud.

Concerns were 
raised that it could lead to thieves taking drastic action, such as 
cutting off people's fingers, in order to access a phone.

Yet, Apple's sensor is 'capacitive' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse.

Additional new iOS 7 security features include
 a Find My iPhone Activation Lock, that asks for an Apple ID and a 
password before the feature can be disabled.

This
 means if a phone is stolen, the thief can't stop the original owner 
from being able to locate it. It will also prevent people from deleting 
data from the handset.

The
 firm has also made 
password manager apps redundant by introducing an encrypted iCloud 
Keychain folder that automatically and securely stores multiple account 
logins and passwords.

It can save credit card details, too. 

John
 Smith, security architect at Veracode told MailOnline: 'At launch the 
iPhone 5S fingerprint reader will only support unlocking the device and 
Apple ID logins.

'This 
does raise the bar for users who don’t currently have a device unlock 
password but enterprise users will already be required to use either a 
PIN or password to unlock their device so the improvement will be less 
significant for them.

'What
 remains to be seen is whether fingerprint authentication will be 
extended over time to protect access to the most sensitive information 
on the device such as corporate email.'
