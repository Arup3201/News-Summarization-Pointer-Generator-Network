It was the inspirational story of limbless amputee Matthew Ames who captured hearts across Australia, and now the father-of-four is getting ready to 'roll' his way through Brisbane for a 5km charity fun run.

In June 2012, Brisbane-born Matthew, suffered from a severe case of toxic shock syndrome which almost claimed his life.

The fate of Mr Ames laid with his wife Diane, who was told that her husband's only chance of survival was to have all four of his limbs removed. She told them to proceed with the operation - the first of its kind at the hospital - and he survived.

Matthew is set to 'roll' his way through a 5km charity fun run 'Bridge to Brisbane' in hope of creating awareness for Amputees and Families Support Group Qld Inc

Matthew is now in the process of being the world's first 'bionic man'. The process, called osseointegration, involves two surgeries on each limb. In the first, an implant is placed inside his bone which sits there for six months to allow the bone to grow around it. During the second stage, a bolt is fitted to the implant that protrudes through the skin.

He is currently six to 12 months away from having what he calls 'whizz bang bionics' fitted to the bolts, which include bionic hands that he can operate by flexing his biceps and triceps.

The prosthetics cost half a million dollars – $150,000 for each arm and $100,000 for each leg – and Matthew requires a new set every six years.

To fund the surgeries, the couple started a foundation, Renovating Matthew, and were overwhelmed with the response from the community, receiving enough donations to pay their medical costs for the next 10 years.

Thanks to the support from his local community and AFSGQ, Matthew  was able to begin his life without all four limbs as comfortable as possible. Now Matthew wants to help AFSGQ find the funds to survive

Thanks to the support from his local community and Amputees and Families Support Group Qld Inc (AFSGQ), Matthew  was able to begin his life without all four limbs as comfortable as possible.

But now, the government funded organization dedicated to helping amputees and their families much like the Ames family, have been given till December next year to find a new source of funding.

The Queensland health reform is in the process of stripping funds from 20 amputee support groups like AFSGQ, to further invest in medicare applicants and a St Vincents hospital.

Cossette Thompson, AFSGQ’s state coordinator told Daily Mail Australia that the government gave no reason as to why its annual $46,000 funding will soon cease.

'We came from a small office that was three metres by three metres and recently expanded to a huge community centre, so to take away our funding just as we up-sized is a real low blow,' she said.

But for Ms Thompson, who knows from first hand experience the struggles of an amputee - her father lost his left leg after being run over by a train -  the real concern is trying to find the funds to continue supporting amputees and their families.

'Just by having someone else who has been there done that and actually understand what it's like to get out of bed and get dressed with one arm or trying to get to the toilet on time.

'I did have one couple say to me that I saved their marriage because we were supporting both of them and when life was really hard we were there to support the family, ' Ms Thompson said.

Matthew and Diane Ames wrote a book about their experience, released in August this year

If AFSGQ and the other 20 organizations do not find the funding required to survive, Ms Thompson fears this reform could put Australia back into the dark ages, 'when you had your leg cut off and that was that.'

'It means that families could experience domestic violence or relationship break ups and they won't get the information or guidance services they require.'

When speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Ames mentioned that he would like to see Australians be more inclusive of those around them who struggle.

The thought of loosing AFSGQ as support, has promoted Mr Ames to participate in the charity fun run, 'Bridge to Brisbane'.

AFSGQ hopes Matthew 'rolling' in the 'Bridge to Brisbane' will create awareness of how the organization has helped amputees in Queensland.

'We want people to know we exist and hopefully businesses or philanthropy funds will come on board to help support and raise the funds,' Ms Thompson said.

Mr Ames told the Brisbane Times that 'there is already so little help for new amputees.'

The former energy and resource executive will be rolling in the 'Bridge to Brisbane' on September 7th, with two of his friends by his side.

Diane and his four children will be waiting for him at the finish line, cheering him on.

The overwhelming amount of support Matthew and his wife Diane received inspired the couple to write a book - Will to Live.

'It was a pretty difficult decision to open up with that level of detail. But I think the experience we had with the community and the consistent feedback we got about how our story had helped others, we wanted to help other people,' Diane told Daily Mail Australia.

'Out of something disastrous or something tragic, there's been some good that's come out of it and if we can share that with other people, if people take something positive from it, that would be great,' she said.
