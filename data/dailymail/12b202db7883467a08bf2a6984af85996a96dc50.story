'Clear contempt': French Economy minister Emmanuel Macron has come under fire for describing female factory workers as 'illiterate'

France's new economy minister is facing calls to quit after just two weeks in the job for calling female factory workers 'illiterate'.

Emmanuel Macron's scathing slur came just days after President Francois Hollande was accused of calling the poor 'the toothless'.

Former Rothschild banker Macron, 36, issued the insult on Europe 1 radio when asked about women workers at the bankrupt Gad abattoir near Paris.

He told listeners: 'In this company, there is a majority of women. Many of them are illiterate.

'Many of them have been told they have have no future in Gad or nearby, and they need to go and work 50 or 60 kilometres away. 

'These people have no driving licences. What can one say to them?'

The new minister was swiftly attacked for his comments by left and right wing MPs.

Right wing member Marc Le Fur said: 'The prime minister should send Mr Macron back to Rothschild.'

The Force Ouvriere union leader Jean Marc Detivelle added: 'It's clear contempt for workers.'

Macron was forced to issue a grovelling recantation later on Wednesday, saying: 'My humblest apologies go to the workers who I may have hurt with this comment for which I can never be sorry enough.'

France's anti-illiteracy group Agence Nationale de Lutte Contre l'Illettrisme estimates that seven per cent of French people read so poorly they are effectively illiterate.

Macron's remark came as part of his first major interview since taking up his job after Hollande sacked his predecessor, the maverick left-wing dissident Arnaud Montebourg.

He also said in the same interview that France was 'sick' and desperately needed pro-business reforms to recover from stagnation and 'mass unemployment'.

Hollande was expected to hold a rare and hotly awaited news conference later today as the embattled and deeply unpopular leader seeks to turn the tide on a catastrophic few weeks.

The subjects are likely to range from France's engagement in Iraq to the dire state of the economy to the president's love life - although he is unlikely to offer further enlightenment on this last topic.

Two weeks ago, former French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler claimed in her new book that her ex-lover President Hollande 'does not like poor people' and refers to them as 'the toothless'.

Embittered Ms Trierweiler, 49, who was dumped by Hollande for a glamorous actress, wrote: 'He portrays himself as a man who doesn't like the rich.

'But in reality, the president does not like poor people.

'He, a man of the left, says in private 'les sans-dents' (the toothless), and he is very proud of his humour.'

When Mr Hollande denied the claim, Ms Trierweiler said she had 'solid proof' of his comments and would use it if he ever took her to court for libel.

Meanwhile, Nicolas Sarkozy is poised to launch a bid to be re-elected as French president in 2017, insiders said yesterday.

Mr Sarkozy, 59, is set to announce this weekend that he will stand for the presidency of the centre-right opposition UMP party.

After losing the 2012 election to Hollande, he told journalists they would 'never hear from him again' and withdrew from political life.

But last year he announced that he was considering standing for re-election because the socialists were ‘ruining France’.
