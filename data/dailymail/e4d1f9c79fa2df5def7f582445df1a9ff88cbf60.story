A woman who keeps a partially paralyzed kangaroo as a ‘therapy pet’ has moved into an exotic animal park in Oklahoma so that the pair can stay together.

In the past two years Christie Carr, who suffers from depression, and Irwin have lived in several different locations in the state after fleeing her home town of Broken Arrow.

The pair left after Carr feared city officials could seize her pet as part of a dispute over licensing and insurance.

Growing frustration with city officials in her home town of Broken Arrow caused Carr to move herself and Irwin first to Claremore, then to her parents' home in McAlester and, in March, to the zoo

After staying temporarily with her parents in McAlester, the pair moved in March to The Garold Wayne Interactive Zoological Park in Wynnewood.

Carr has nursed Irwin, a red kangaroo, back to health after he was partially paralyzed from running into a fence several years ago.

The disabled pet sleeps in a bed, eats Twizzlers, wears boy’s clothes on occasion and a diaper.

Now comfortably settled in their new home, Carr has said that the move has been good for them both.

Irwin gets to interact with other people and some animals, and her emotional life has been enriched by being around all the animals.

‘Just me and him together, it's almost like he was feeding off my depression,’ said Carr, who lives in the zoo's staff house.

‘He likes people, he likes to be around people and here, there is something always going on.’

Irwin, however, can't play with the park's other kangaroo, Pluto, who lives near a pond.

Carr and zoo founder Joe Schreibvogel are scared Irwin could lose his balance and fall into the water, so they are hoping to build a new kangaroo enclosure in the future.

Carr and 3-year-old Irwin arrived at the zoo after spats with officials in Broken Arrow.

Carr's therapist had certified Irwin as a therapy pet under the Americans with Disabilities Act. But city officials initially feared Irwin could pose a threat to the public's safety.

Native to Australia, healthy male great red kangaroos can grow up to 7 feet tall, weigh more than 200 pounds and bound 25 feet in a single leap.

But veterinarians said Irwin would probably not grow larger than 50 pounds because of his injury and because he has been neutered.

Irwin has gained about 20 pounds during the past two years and is now able to hop better.

The city council eventually voted to create an exotic animal ordinance exemption that allowed Carr to keep Irwin within city limits under certain conditions.

The permit required exotic animal owners to, among other things, have a $50,000 liability insurance policy for any injuries inflicted by the animal, certification that the animal has adequate housing and meet all federal and state guidelines for licensing.

An anonymous donor paid for Carr's insurance policy.

But growing frustration with city officials caused Carr to move herself and Irwin first to Claremore, then to her parents' home in McAlester and, in March, to the zoo.

‘We called her up and offered her a place to stay and Irwin a zoo to hang out with a bunch of other animals, and they've been here ever since,’ said Schreibvogel, who founded the zoo, which is named after his brother who died in a car accident in 1997.

The park has close to 800 animals - the majority came from sanctuaries and other zoos - and 18 workers. It's a place, Schreibvogel said, where animals and humans come for a second chance.

‘Most of the volunteers here are ex-druggies, ex-alcoholics, on prison's door step,’ he said.

‘Why do people turn to drugs and alcohol? Usually because they don't fit in somewhere. Well, here these animals don't judge you.’

Schreibvogel and Carr have bonded over the backlash they've both received from animal-rights groups. They say it has helped them get to where they are.

‘Everybody has an opinion, and everybody has a right to an opinion,’ Schreibvogel said. ‘If they would have euthanized him three years ago, he wouldn't be walking around, hopping now, so not everyone knows what they are talking about.’
