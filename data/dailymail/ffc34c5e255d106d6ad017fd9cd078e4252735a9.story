A funeral service has been held for comedian James McNair who was killed in a six-car pileup on the New Jersey turnpike which left fellow comic Tracy Morgan in hospital.

Family, friends and fellow comedians gathered at the Paramount Theatre in Peekskill, New York, yesterday to pay tribute to the man known affectionately as Uncle Jimmy Mack.

During the service McNair's son sang a poignant tribute to his father, while his daughter Danita had to be supported by her brother as she passed out going by his open casket.

Remembering McNair's life, fellow performers told about his habit of paying comics out of his own pocket if an audience failed to materialise at one of his shows, and recalled how he sold bootleg DVDs to boost his income.

'If another person come here and try to sell bootleg DVDs, you need to get rid of them immediately,' joked one attendee according to CBS.

The New York Daily News reports that McNair had been saving before his death in an attempt to buy a prom dress for Danita.

During the service mourners had an impromptu collection and raised $500 for her.

Peekskill mayor Frank Catalina paid tribute to McNair's community work, saying: 'He was very serious about talking about the youth of our community. He didnâ€™t fool around when you talked about health care.'

McNair was killed in a crash early Saturday when a Walmart truck smashed into the limo bus he was travelling in on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7.

The collision injured McNair's fellow passenger, comedian Tracy Morgan, while comedians Ardie Fuqua, 43, and Harris Stanton and Morgan's assistant Jeffrey Millea, 36, were also among those injured.

Stanton, 37, was released from hospital on Monday with a severely broken wrist.

After the service, McNair's family gathered around his casket to say a final goodbye to the comedian

McNair and Morgan met while they were both working at the Uptown Comedy Club in Manhattan and quickly became friends.

Just before his death, McNair had been helping former 'Saturday Night Live' comic Morgan work on material for his new stand-up routine.

Sources close to Morgan say the 30 Rock star is still in critical condition following the accident, but is 'doing better after sustaining a number of injuries - including a broken femur, broken nose and broken ribs.

Following the hearing, Mr. Roper, 35, was released on $50,000 bail.
