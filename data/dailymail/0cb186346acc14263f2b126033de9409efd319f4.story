A young man who has spent almost a decade in prison for a brutal murder he insists he didn't commit, could be close to finally being freed.

The only evidence that linked Ryan Ferguson 
to the murder of a sports editor found strangled in his office car park
in Columbia, Missouri, was testimony from two witnesses who have since 
recanted their statements under oath.

But after nearly 10 years in a maximum security prison, the 28-year-old could finally be close to having his conviction quashed.

Hope: Ryan Ferguson, pictured with his legal team at a recent appeal hearing, could soon be released

Appeal: Ryan Ferguson has always denied that he was involved in the murder of Kent Heitholt

If his most recent appeal is upheld Ferguson, who has consistently denied being involved in the death of Kent Heitholt, could be home in time for Thanksgiving.

'It's hard to have much hope, at this point, in the justice system based on what they've done,' he told Good Morning America.

It is easy to understand his cautious optimism. Ferguson was just 21 when he was sentenced to 40 years for a murder his friend Chuck Erikson had
implicated him in, despite Erikson not remembering any details of the 
night in question.

Even after Erikson recanted his account, telling an appeals court he had lied under oath, Ferguson remained behind bars.  

'It's
scary knowing that they're not looking for the truth, they're looking 
for a conviction… I might never have a chance to get my life back 
again,' he said.

The latest step in his legal challenge came last month, when lawyers took his case to a Kansas City appeals court.

Cautious: After spending ten years in jail for a crime he says he didn't commit, Ferguson finds it hard to be optimistic

Now
Ferguson, his father Bill and rest of the family who have campaigned tirelessly to have his 
conviction overturned, are waiting to hear if the judges will grant him a
new trial.

Victim: Sports editor Kent Heitholt was found strangled in his newspaper's car park

Chief Legal Analyst for ABC, Dan Abrams, said there would be no evidence to convict Ferguson is a retrial is ordered.

A
bloody footprint and hair found at the crime scene did not match him, 
and the witnesses whose testimony his conviction was based on, later 
admitted they had lied under oath.

After spending his adult life behind bars, Ferguson is just trying to stay positive.

'I'm
going be ready for whatever life throws at me because I've been 
preparing for so long,' he said. 'I just … maintain positivity and hope 
that one day I'll wake up and I'll get a good phone call.'

He has constantly proclaimed his evidence, ever since Erikson told police they had been involved in the crime two years after
Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Mr Heitholt was discovered 
strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of November 1, 
2001.

Erikson told police the pair, who had been 17 at the time, had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question.

After reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved, saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him.

In his police interviews Erikson, who was a drug user, was unable to give details of the crime, wrongly stating that Mr Heitholt had been strangled by a shirt, or a bungee cord, before the detective questioning him tells Erikson it was a belt.

Memory loss: Chuck Erikson, who says he cannot remember the night of the murder, recently retracted his statement that Ryan Ferguson was involved

He claimed however, that he struck the editor once, before Ferguson strangled him.

'The
police threatened me to implicate Ferguson or else I would be solely 
responsible for Heitholt’s death and be charged with first-degree murder
and possibly sentenced to death,' Erickson said in an affidavit.

Despite fingerprints, a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching Erikson or Ferguson, police arrested them.

'Everything is wrong about this case, 
everything's wrong about it. It makes absolutely no sense,' Kathleen 
Zellner, who is working of Ferguson's appeal, told the court.

Ferguson stated to police that on the night Heitholt was killed, he and Erikson had gone to a bar and then he drove them home. 

When his latest appeal was denied, Ferguson told CBS: 'I just sat in this room by myself. And 
just stared at the floor ... and it's frustrating because you don't know,
even with all the facts, if you'll ever get your life back.'

The appeal last year centered around the two witnesses who had implicated Ferguson both admitting they lied.

Erikson, who is serving a 
25-year-sentence, is now saying that although he still has no memory of 
the night in question, he believes he acted alone.

Tribune janitor Jerry Trump, who said
he saw the young men at the scene, also later admitted under oath that 
he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown.

In his police interview, Erikson said: 'I could just be fabricating it all and not know. This is after reading the newspaper article in October and this is kinda what I put together with what could've happened.'

He went on to say: 'From there on I'm just presuming what happened. I'm making presumptions based on what I read in the newspaper.'

According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive, was never thoroughly investigated.

Fellow sportswriter Michael Boyd had left the office the same time as Heitholt, who was married with two children. He says that he drove off before Heitholt.

The 1991 blue Oldsmobile he was 
driving that night was never searched, and he traded it shortly 
afterwards. Police have never been able to trace it.

A forensic pathologist, Dr Larry Blum, has examined evidence from the trial for Ms Zellner, CBS said.

He claims that the tire tool Erikson said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries.

He added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes, meaning Mr Boyd put himself at the scene very close to the time
the crime was reported.

According to CBS Mr Boyd said he left the car park at about 2.20am, 
only six minutes before 911 was called.

Mr Boyd, who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime, told 48 Hours that he returned to
the car park later that night after hearing about the murder.

'I've
always felt that the system works,' Ms Zellner said, as she explained 
her determination to have him freed. 'He is absolutely innocent. ...I 
don't want to be part of a system that cannot recognize and correct an 
error.'

His family have 
gone to great lengths to raise awareness about Ferguson's case, 
including driving a car emblazoned with his picture across the U.S.

Support: Bill Ferguson has constantly campaigned for his son's release and recently drove across the U.S. in a car featuring details of Ryan's case

On the Free Ryan Ferguson Facebook page, Ferguson sent a message from his cell saying how the support has helped him through his 'hellish experience'.

'The contrast between the freedom which the open road on a beautiful day offers and the mind numbing confinement of these claustrophobic concrete walls couldn't be more harsh,' he said, in reference to the road trip undertaken to promote his cause.

Ferguson's story will be featured on Nightline tonight at 12.35am eastern time.
