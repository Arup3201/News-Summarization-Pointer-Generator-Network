Ethereal and magical, these patterns look like they could be out of a fantasy movie, but they are actually made by fireflies buzzing through the twilight captured by clever photography.

Photographer Vincent Brady, 25, shot the stunning series of images using time-lapse photography to portray the beauty of fireflies in a whole new light.

Mr Brady stacks his images - taken over a few seconds - to allow the flickering bugs to create vibrant beams of light against the still, dark backdrops.

Stunning: Photographer Vincent Brady captured these remarkable images of fireflies by using time lapse photography

Conditions: The pictures were shot in humid, night time conditions when fireflies produce a cold light from their bodies

Chemical reaction: The light is created by a chemical reaction called bioluminescence which the arthropods use mainly to attract a mate

Setting: Mr Brady managed to capture the remarkable images in the Lake of the Ozarks, in Missouri, and Grand Ledge, in Michigan

Mr Brady became interested in capturing fireflies in 2012 when he used the same technique he had previously tried to capture star trails to photograph the bugs.

He said: 'Fireflies are incredible - the more I learn about them the more interesting they seem to become.

Otherworldly: The series of images look like they have come out of a fantasy movie, but they were all taken in natural settings

Swarm: Mr Brady said he would scope out spots where he wanted to shoot during the daytime, although the fireflies often would not appear where he had hoped

Scene: The photographer said he enjoyed chasing the fireflies as he attempted to capture these impressive images

Lighting up the sky: The fireflies appear to light up the night sky as the stars stream above them in this remarkable image, taken using time-lapse photography

'I would scope out spots in the daytime to shoot, but often where I wanted to shoot wasn't where they wanted to be so I'd always scramble in the blue hour just after the sun goes down as they begin the disco to set up a shot.

'The moon was also a factor. In open areas along the lake where the only light shining was the moon they wouldn't be active as they don't like to compete with the moonlight.

'It is good fun chasing them. Cruising along the lake under the stars with the fireflies lighting up the treeline is breathtaking.'

The light fantastic: Fireflies, pictured at the Lake of Ozarks, Missouri, surround a bridge as they light up the night sky

Breathtaking: Mr Brady said it was 'good fun chasing them. Cruising along the lake under the stars with the fireflies lighting up the treeline is breathtaking'
