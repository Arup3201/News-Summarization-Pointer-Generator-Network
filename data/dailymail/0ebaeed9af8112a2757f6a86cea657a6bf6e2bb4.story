About two dozen heavily armed police officers stormed a home in Chicago's southern suburbs Wednesday to free four remaining hostages and capture two suspects, ending a standoff that lasted more than 20 hours.

The two women and two children, ages 6 and 12, still being held at the home in the small city of Harvey were freed midmorning without a shot being fired, said Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart.

Footage shot by a TV news helicopter showed officers with armor, shields and rifles sweeping in through the front door as other officers aimed weapons and took cover near two large armored vehicles that were parked out front.

Officers ran out of the house with the remaining hostages then brought out two men in handcuffs. 

Dart said negotiators were in 'constant contact' with the hostage-takers throughout the night and into the morning until a decision was made to storm the house.

Officers found the hostages on the second floor. They were unharmed.

'We were able to take everyone down without any injuries to anybody and without shots being fired,' Dart said. 

The tense standoff began after two police officers were shot while responding to reports of a burglary at a home in Harvey, a small suburb of Chicago, at 12.48pm yesterday.

The two suspected robbers took two women - one of them a nurse - and six children hostage at the house on West 147th Street and Robey Avenue, but later released four of the youngsters.

The two men initially held six children but released one after learning he had a breathing problem. They then released another three over the course of the evening

Two officers were shot after responding to calls of a burglary in progress. Darnell Keel, who has served with Harvey police for 18 years, suffered a broken arm while another officer received a graze wound

One child who has a breathing problem was released at around 6:30pm, another around 30 minutes later and a 1-year-old was let out at around 7:45 pm

Finally, at 10.30pm, the suspects released a four child, believed to be another one-year-old, according to NBC Chicago.

Officers initially believed that there were only five children in the house, but after interviewing an 11-year-old that had been let out they discovered that there were six children in total.

Darnell Keel, an 18-year veteran of the Harvey police force, suffered a broken arm after an exchange of gunfire with the suspects, while a second officer suffered a graze wound.

Mr Keel was treated in hospital but was released on Tuesday evening and is expected to have surgery at some point today, police said. 

Armed police evacuated the block around the house and have cordoned off the street. Officers with high-powered rifles have been seen, and a spokesman confirmed the state SWAT team also responded 

Harvey police spokesman Sean Howard, pictured, said police initially believed five children were taken hostage, but after questioning an 11-year-old who was released, they discovered a sixth child was also involved

Authorities said they do not know the suspects, though they have identified the victims. Officers confirmed that the woman was a nurse, but refused to say whether the hostages were related 

'We thank God that our officer was not injured more seriously than he was, and our major concern right now are the individuals inside the home, that's what we're focusing on right now, their safety,' Harvey Police Chief Denard Eaves said. 

Police spokesman Sean Howard said officers do not know the suspects though they have identified the victims. However he refused to say whether the hostages were related. 

Hostage negotiators are on the scene and are trying to get the last two children released, according to police

Officers evacuated a nearby middle school, but only teachers were in the building at the time

Officers, including a SWAT team, surrounded the home and the entire block was evacuated, affecting about 100 residents, Howard said.

A nearby middle school was evacuated, but only staff members were in the building. 

Twenty-six law enforcement agencies were assisting, Howard said, while an armored vehicle and officers in body armor with high-powered rifles could be seen in the neighborhood.
