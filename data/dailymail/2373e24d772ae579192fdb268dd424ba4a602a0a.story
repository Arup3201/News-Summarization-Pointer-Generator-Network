Four people have been arrested after a man was beaten to death at his home in a sleepy West Yorkshire village in an alleged feud between travellers.

The 57-year-old man died of head injuries yesterday morning after being found by police at his property in Thorpe, on Saturday night.

New photographs show a 4X4 vehicle was used to plough down a wall outside the bungalow and every window was smashed.

A man aged 50, a woman aged 37, and two 16-year-old males were arrested on Sunday evening on suspicion of murder.

Attack: The 57-year-old man died of head injuries yesterday morning after being found by police at his property in Thorpe, West Yorkshire, on Saturday evening

Homeowner Benny Reynolds is a well-known car trader and prominent in the traveller community. It is not thought he is the murder victim, sources said today.

The arrests were made in the Barnsley and
Doncaster areas, both in South Yorkshire, and police said today the 
four remain in custody.

Neighbour Andaleeb Naseem, 35, said: 'We heard banging and screaming and shouting coming from next door at about 7.30pm on Saturday.

'I think Benny is okay because I saw him after the attack. I don't know who has been killed.

'As the commotion was going on we told the children to stay downstairs, because they wanted to run upstairs and look out of the window onto his land.'

Investigation: Locals said a 4×4 car was used to ram down the gates and a large group of men smashed their way into the property on Middleton Road

Response: Reports were first received at 7.23pm on Saturday of a disturbance at the man¿s home in Thorpe

Directions: West Yorkshire Police mounted a major response to the incident in Thorpe on Saturday night

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said reports were received at 7.23pm of a disturbance at the as yet unidentified man’s home.

Locals said a 4x4 car was used to ram 
down the gates and a large group of men smashed their way into the 
property on Middleton Road.

It
is believed the man, who died from his injuries at Leeds General 
Infirmary, worked as a car dealer and lived with his daughters.

A murder inquiry has been launched and police urge any witnesses to come forward.

Dozens of police officers, a police helicopter and at least one ambulance were seen at the property yesterday.

Residents in the quiet village, which lies at the intersection of the M62 and M1, were shocked by the killing and police have been visiting homes to offer security advice.

Police are trying to establish if any property was stolen. A spokesman said: ‘Detectives are following various lines of inquiry and neighbourhood policing team officers are focusing patrols in the area.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
