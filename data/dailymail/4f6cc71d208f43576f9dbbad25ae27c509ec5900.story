The head of the Bolshoi Theatre and its leading dancer have blamed each other for creating the poisonous atmosphere that led to last month's acid attack on the ballet's artistic director.

General director Anatoly Iksanov and Nikolai Tsiskaridze, the principal dancer, traded accusations of intrigue and skulduggery yesterday as the investigation into the  January 17 attack on Sergei Filin, the company's artistic director continued.

Asked who he thought was behind the 
assault, Mr Iksanov told a Russian magazine: 'I have only one feeling: 
that everything which happened is a logical result of the mayhem that 
was created by Nikolai Maksimovich Tsiskaridze.

'The dumping of mud on the theatre 
and its staff, the constant intrigues and [his] confidence in his own 
impunity is the background which made this tragedy possible.'

Mr Tsiskaridze, 39, and the management
of the theatre have had a long-standing, and often public, dispute over
artistic differences and the recent reconstruction of the 188-year-old 
main building, which the dancer claimed left it 'looking like a Turkish 
hotel'.

Mr Tsiskaridze, a traditionalist, was 
one of several whom Mr Iksanov passed over in favour of Mr Filin for the post 
of artistic director in March 2011.

Mr Filin has undergone several 
operations on his eyes and face since an assailant flung a jar of acid 
into his eyes near his Moscow home last month. Doctors hope to save his 
vision.

Mr Iksanov claimed Mr Tsiskaridze had 
'crazy ambitions' and 'no one in the theatre' doubted that his alleged 
posturing contributed to the atmosphere in which Mr Filin, 42, was 
attacked.

Nikolai Tsiskaridze is one of the figures at the centre of bitter infighting at the ballet company

Principal Bolshoi Dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze was questioned as a witness in the assault on the theatre's ballet director Sergei Filin

'I'm not accusing him of this particular crime; I'm accusing Nikolai of increasing the tension in the theatre,' he said.

The principal dancer responded in a 
separate interview in the same magazine. 'Mr Iksanov has no evidence or 
right to assert my involvement in this dirty business.

'Why was there any
need to utter my name in connection with this terrible crime? There has
not been such a shameful scandal on an international scale at the 
Bolshoi for some time.'

Mr Tsiskaridze was involved in a 
dispute 2003, when he refused to back the ousting of ballerina 
Anastasiya Volochkova. 'I was told to go to out to the press and say 
that I couldn't lift her,' he said. 'But for one thing, I could lift 
her.'

Mr Iksanov said that Mr Tsiskaridze 
had lobbied to become the ballet's artistic director or to take his own 
job as general director. Previously he has described the dancer as 'like an abscess'.

He also claimed that the dancer was 
behind the online distribution of private erotic photographs of Gennady 
Yanin, the head of the company, in 2011, which forced the latter's 
resignation. Mr Tsiskaridze dismissed suggestions he was linked to the 
leak.

Backstabbing: The Bolshoi Theatre, an enduring symbol of Russian culture, is notorious for power struggles and backstabbing among dancers and directors

The general director also denied Mr 
Tsiskaridze's claims that the six-year reconstruction of the theatre, 
which ended in 2011, left it with cramped facilities and poor acoustics.

The Bolshoi Theatre in the heart of Moscow is
an enduring symbol of Russian culture and a big draw for both locals 
and foreign tourists, but has seen power struggles among both dancers 
and directors during its tumultuous history dating back more than 200 
years.

Mr Filin, a 
former leading dancer at the Bolshoi who has been in the high-pressure 
job at the heart of Russian culture for nearly two years, was attacked 
outside his Moscow apartment building as he returned from the theatre.

A
Moscow native, he joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was 
named its artistic leader in March 2011, after three years in a similar 
position at another Moscow theatre.
