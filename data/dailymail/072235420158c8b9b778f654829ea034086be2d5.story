Australian rock royalty Violent Soho cleaned up at an awards ceremony this week but because of stringent airline laws, almost didn't make it to the ceremony.

The band attempted to board their Virgin Australia flight from Brisbane to Melbourne on Wednesday to head to the AIR Independent Music Awards, when guitarist James Tidswell was prevented from boarding.

Tidswell, who with his band won Best Independent Album at the awards, was sporting a shirt emblazoned with the words 'Eat, S**t, Die'. 

James Tidswell, guitarist from Australian band Violent Soho, was prevented from boarding a Virgin Australia flight on Wednesday night for wearing this shirt

'We almost didn't make it to the awards and I guess had I put my foot down as a human being living in a free country, we wouldn't have,' Tidswell said.

Tidswell told Fairfax Media that a Virgin Airlines staff member asked him to remove the shirt due to new terrorism laws.

The lyrics, from Painters and Docker’s 1990 classic single of the same name, was deemed a 'threat' by staff, who thought the shirt inappropriate.

After turning the shirt inside out, Tidswell was allowed to board the flight with fellow band member Luke Henry.

A photo of Tidswell wearing the shirt was posted to the band's Instagram account with the caption, '[James] wasn't allowed on the plane wearing his Painters and Dockers shirt - they claim he posed a threat.'

The band posted a follow up photo on their Instagram account of Tidswell shirtless and drinking a beer at Brisbane airport after the incident

The lyrics, from Painters and Docker’s 1990 classic single of the same name, was deemed a 'threat' by staff, who thought the shirt inappropriate.

'She was really apologetic and she was to some degree shaking, she just said she feels really bad having to ask but I am not going to be allowed on to the plane in the clothes I am wearing,' he said.

'I said "are you sure?" and she said, "yes, definitely" She said it was not a thing from the company but it involved the new laws due to terrorism, and with what is written on my shirt, I would be considered a threat.'

However, a statement from Virgin claimed the ban was imposed because of the offence the shirt may have caused other passengers.

'A passenger on board flight VA326 from Brisbane to Melbourne was yesterday asked to cover a clothing item that could be considered to be offensive by other passengers,' the statement read.

'Under our terms of carriage, and consistent with many other airlines, passengers may not behave in a manner which would be considered to be offensive, or in a manner which might cause discomfort, distress, or offence to another person.'

The band has a history of wearing clothing that pushes the boundaries

Violent Soho won Best Independent Album and Best Independent Hard Rock, Heavy or Punk Album at the Independent Music Awards and have been nominated for four ARIA awards.

'After complying with the request the passenger boarded and the flight left on time.'

Tidswell said that he could not understand the reasoning behind the request, and that it seemed strange that by reversing his shirt he was suddenly no longer a threat.

'We almost didn't make it to the awards and I guess had I put my foot down as a human being living in a free country, we wouldn't have,' he said.  

The pair later made light of the incident, posting a photo of Tidswell in the airport, shirtless and drinking a beer, with the caption '[James] poses no threat. He just wants to have fun'.

'We took a photo of it because I couldn't believe it was possible to live in a time and place where that was the situation,' Tidswell told Fairfax.
