Fulham fought back from two goals down against ten man Blackpool to extend their unbeaten run in the Championship to five games.

But boos accompanied the final whistle at Craven Cottage. It did not feel like a success for the home side,who dominated completely after Blackpool’s Tony McMahon was sent off in the first half but failed to find a winner.

Manager Kit Symons, previously caretaker manager but enjoying his first game at Craven Cottage since being appointed on a permanent basis, conceded it was an opportunity missed.

‘It’s two points dropped for me,’ he said, ‘We threw the proverbial kitchen sink at them.’

Joe Lewis was the hero of the night for the visitors. The keeper made several vital saves to give his side their first point in five games and just their seventh of the season.

Blackpool manager Lee Clark, who faces a tough job to rescue the seasiders’ season after taking over this week hailed his side’s ‘heroic’ second half display.

‘The second half my lads were heroic,’ he said, ‘I don’t think many better teams in this league have more talent than fulham and we did amazingly well. Joe made some brilliant saves.’

But for a moment of madness from captain McMahon - who saw red for lashing out at Hugo Rodallega off the ball - Blackpool might have taken all three points.

‘I’ll be having a conversation with him,’ said Clark, ‘I’ve admired from afar and like him even more since I’ve got to work with him but even if hasn’t made contact it’s not good. I haven’t spoken to him yet that’s how he knows I’m annoyed.’

Most of the visiting fans had journeyed several hours to support their side in the bracing cold.

But within 90 seconds they were warmed by the sight of Ishmael Miller putting the seasiders ahead. Donervon Daniels played a ball into the box which Miller controlled with his chest before coolly poking past Marcus Bettinelli into the bottom corner with his left foot. The 6ft3in Miller, built like a heavyweight boxer, celebrated his goal with a solo samba dance.

He showed off his quick feet again in the 26th minute, hurtling into the box, sending Dan Burn the wrong and evading another two Fulham defenders then pulling the ball back to leave Jacob Murphy to tap in from five yards out. The 19 year old winger on loan from Norwich, impressed on his Blackpool debut. Murphy, an England under-20 international whose twin brother Josh remains at Norwich, is on a three month deal which the seasiders might be keen to extend.

Just minutes short of the interval Captain McMahon lost his head and lashed out at Hugo Rodallega off the ball and was shown red by referee Robert Madley, acting on information from his linesman. Blackpool manager Lee Clark asked for an explanation from the officials as they headed down the tunnel at half time.

Scott Parker pulled one back in first half stoppage time from a Moussa Dembele corner. A scuffed clearance by Daniels fell kindly to him and the 34-year-old former England midfielder beat keeper Lewis with a low drive into the near corner.

The cottagers dominated for most of the second half as they attempted to take advantage of their extra man against a tiring Blackpool. Joe Lewis kept the home side out with a few blockbuster saves, notably of a powerful George Williams effort from 20 yards and to deny Nikolay Bodurov.

Eventually, Lewis could keep them out no longer. He was helpless as he punched the ball into his own net from a Bryan Ruiz corner in the 73rd minute, although he appeared to have been pushed.

‘That was a definite foul for me,’ said Clark.
