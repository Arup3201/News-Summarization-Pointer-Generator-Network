European champions Real Madrid have signed Costa Rica's World Cup hero Keylor Navas on a six-year deal.

The 27-year-old goalkeeper, who leaves Levante for the Santiago Bernabeu, was a star performer as Costa Rica reached the quarter-finals in Brazil.

Navas, who is expected to challenge 
Spanish duo Diego Lopez and Iker Casillas for a first-team spot, made 
more saves last season (141) than any other goalkeeper in Europe's top 5
 leagues.
