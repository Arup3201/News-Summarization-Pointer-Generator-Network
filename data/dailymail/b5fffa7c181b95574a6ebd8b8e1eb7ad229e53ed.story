Andy Murray has come a long way over the past six weeks but the final frontier remains tantalisingly out of reach.

There have been three ATP titles and some courageous wins but beating one of the world's very best players is still beyond him, as Novak Djokovic showed in dismissing him from the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters 7-5 6-2.

Having competed on almost equal terms and even gone ahead in the second set, Murray completely unravelled without warning to lose 20 of the last 25 points and make it more likely that the Serb will hold off Roger Federer's challenge for the world No 1 ranking this year.

While Murray's main objective of this week – confirming a place in the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in eight days' time – was accomplished, Djokovic's personal superiority over him continues.

He has now won all four of their meetings this year and seven out of the last eight, the 2013 Wimbledon final now looking very much the exception to the rule.

That is a concern, but in the immediate aftermath Murray could look at the post US Open period with pride before taking a well-earned breather this weekend.

'The last six weeks have been fantastic, only positive, and will stand me in good stead,' he said after suddenly sliding to a 101-minute defeat. 'Novak has played incredibly well these last three or four years. I wasn't ready to play against the top few guys at the start of the year but I don't feel my game is that far away from them now.

'I was feeling okay tonight but I started rushing at the end, I can still take confidence from the last few weeks.'

At the 02 Arena event – the draw for which will take place on Monday – you could see him beating anyone in the field but it looks a stretch against the world No 1.

The impression is that Murray has to push all the way into the red line on the dial to compete with Djokovic right now, and he did that up until the unexpected denouement, when he collapsed from leading 2-1 with a break in the second.

Coming in on an eleven-match winning streak he often got the better of the longer rallies but his erratic first serve made life difficult throughout the first set, and he had to fend off five break points before succumbing to the sixth at 5-6.

With Djokovic getting increasingly agitated after missing three early break points in the second Murray broke for 2-1, only to concede his own serve straightaway. In fact it turned out to be the last game he won of the match, and he went behind 2-4 with a game of eyewatering ineptitude that included two double faults.

But six weeks on the road, and the relentless pressure that Djokovic exerts, can do that to a man and the last fifteen minutes of this encounter should not be allowed to blight a fine effort since the US Open.

Earlier, Federer had found himself blasted off the court by the scorching serve of Canadian Milos Raonic, who scored an outstanding 7-6, 7-5 victory.

Had the Swiss won, the field for the 02 Arena would have been set with David Ferrer and Kei Nishikori taking the last two places after Tomas Berdych had become the sixth qualifier in the opening match by defeating Kevin Anderson. 

But upsetting Federer put everything on hold, and when Nishikori beat Ferrer 3-6, 7-6, 6-4 on Friday night Raonic could celebrate qualification, with Canada and Japan now being represented in London.

Federer, meanwhile, was left to look on the bright side that he has the weekend off before a fortnight that will see him compete in London and then the Davis Cup final for Switzerland.
