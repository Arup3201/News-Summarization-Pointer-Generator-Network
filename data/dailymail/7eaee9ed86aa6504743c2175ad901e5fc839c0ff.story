Plenty of ancient animals that roamed the earth after dinosaurs became extinct look rather strange to our modern eyes.

And a newly-discovered ancestor of the cow, which looks a little bit like a super-sized guinea pig with a quiff hairstyle, has been unearthed in China.

Two fossilised skulls of the bizarre bovid 
were discovered in Hezheng in Gansu Province, where a number of fossils 
of ancient mammals between 23 million and 2.5 million years old have been
 unearthed since the 1970s.

Dr Shi Qinqin, of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing described the new species, called Tsaidamotherium brevirostrum, in the journal of Science China.

The genus has been discovered only once before, 70 years ago, in northwest China and the new discovery sheds light on the skull morphology of the group of species.

Tsaidamotherium was a mid-sized late Miocene bovid living between 11 million and five million years ago.

It’s most unique feature is a ‘horn-core’ apparatus that has only been seen in this area of China.

It was first observed by palaeontologists in the 1930s when two bovid cranial fragments with the strange features were spotted among deposits in the Qaidam basin.

The only ancient bovid in the basin: The sole example of the new species, Tsaidamotherium brevirostrum, is a skull with the horn-core apparatus (pictured) that was collected in the Linxia Basin close to the village of Yancanping, as well as a practically full skull of a female with a broken horn

The ‘absolutely exclusive horn-core apparatus’ of the skulls were deemed so strange they were assigned to a new genus and species in 1935.

The sole example of the new species, Tsaidamotherium brevirostrum, is a fragment of skull with the horn-core apparatus that was collected in the Linxia Basin close to the village of Yancanping, as well as a practically full skull of a female with a broken horn.

The creature has a short snout and a high nasal cavity, perhaps suited to living at high altitudes, analysis of the skeleton revealed.

Although Tsaidamotherium fossils are ‘extremely scarce’ the area in which more could be found is large in the northern part of the Tibetan plateau and could stretch much further afield.

No relative but a good lookalike: Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) which are native to South America bear some resemblance to the 'face' of the newly discovered ancient species, although they are not related as the capybara is the largest rodent in the world
