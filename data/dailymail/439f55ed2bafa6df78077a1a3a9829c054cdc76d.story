Katarina Marinkovic shakes her head in disbelief.

She is in shock, struggling to come to terms with, not just the murder of neighbour Vesna Crnobrnja, but also the fact that neighbouring houses in Flame Tree Street, Casula have now played host to four deaths in recent times.

'This street - a plane crashed into one house, it crashed and two people died and then a man hung himself in a white house while it was getting built and now this happens, it's really upsetting,' she said.

Mrs Marinkovic recoiled at the shock that a man had taken his own life inside another home which while it was being built.

'It's very sad, all really shocking, I couldn't sleep last night, I couldn't fall asleep,' she said.

'We never really spoke we'd wave here and there, she worked at the chicken shop down the road and I would get food from there and she would serve me, she was lovely, she was a nice, nice lady,' said Mrs Marinkovic.

His legal counsel, barrister Bart Vasic did not apply for bail but sought to have the matter heard at Campbelltown Local Court.

Magistrate Sharon Holdsworth adjourned the matter for December 3rd when Mr Crnobrnja would appear by video link.

Some residents of the street remained indoors today, preferring to avoid getting involved, others spoke openly about how normal the family 'across the road' seemed to them.

'We never really spoke we'd wave here and there, she worked at the chicken shop down the road and I would get food from there and she would serve me, she was lovely, she was a nice, nice lady,' said Mrs Marinkovic.

Work continued as normal at the chicken shop but Vesna's colleagues were too distraught to speak but flowers had been delivered to the store, along with condolences.

'A nice family but we didn't speak much. Tthe dog was always running around, they always had a lot of cars at the front the kids had friends coming over.

'I never really saw the husband, I never really noticed him, I always saw the wife outside.

'I feel for the kids, I saw the kids crying and I saw I think the grandfather who was crying and sobbing, it is just really, really sad.

'To think that could happen in the front yard in broad daylight, it's really upsetting, I really feel for the family.

'I can't believe four people have died across a few houses now.'
