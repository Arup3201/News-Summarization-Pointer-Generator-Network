Former Tottenham Hotspur and Germany midfielder Steffen Freund was spotted dressed as Tinky Winky from the Teletubbies during Tuesday night's 2015 World Darts Championship action.

The 44-year-old was among those getting in the mood at the Alexandra Palace, where Adrian Lewis hit a nine-darter but lost against Raymond van Barneveld, and 16-time world champion Phil Taylor took on Kim Huybrechts.

Freund was appointed as international technical coordinator under Mauricio Pochettino at White Hart Lane in August after being brought in as assistant head coach to Andre Villas-Boas in July 2012.

His current role sees the former footballer responsible for their overseas projects, the development of the club's players on loan internationally, and scouting potential future stars.

Freund played for Tottenham between 1998 and 2003, making 102 appearances in the Barclays Premier League, after spending five years at German club Borussia Dortmund.

In Dortmund he won the Bundesliga title twice and the Champions League, while in north London he won the Football League Cup.

The World Darts Championship is known for its 2,500-capacity crowd at the Ally Pally getting into the festive spirit, and it seems those in football are no exception.
