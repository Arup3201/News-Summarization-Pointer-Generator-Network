Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star went to house when ex failed to respond to her calls and texts

Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Taylor Armstrong was at the house when her estranged husband Russell's dead body was discovered, it has been reported.

The 40-year-old reality star became concerned for Armstrong's wellbeing when he failed to show up for a meeting they had arranged for on Monday afternoon and did not respond to her phone calls and texts, TMZ claim.

The website alleges that she went to the Mulholland Drive house where her ex was staying with a friend that evening, and raised the alarm with the home owner.

The owner then looked through Armstrong's bedroom window and saw his dead body hanging, TMZ claim.

According to the site, the estranged couple had been in regular contact despite her recent allegations that he physically abused her during their marriage.

Following the news of his death, Russell's 
photographer pal Tom Vickers says the father of three - who had a 
five-year-old daughter with Taylor - was struggling to cope with the 
pressures of fame, saying reality television had ruined his life.

Vickers, who forged a friendship with Russell over recent months, last spoke to him on August 4.

He told RadarOnline: 'It's terrible news. But 
during our phone call he didn't sound like the Russell that I knew.'

Vickers said Russell was depressed after Taylor filed for divorce from him amid allegations he physically abused her. 

He continued: 'I told him people don't believe everything they read and he told
 me: "It's funny how a reality show can ruin your entire life".'

In the last interview before his death, he spoke to website Rumorfix last month 
about how difficult he found it to live with his new fame, and how it 
contributed to his marriage break-up.

He said: 'The pressure of being in the TV spotlight was pretty overwhelming.

'It took our manageable problems and made them worse. We are very supportive of each other and love each other.

'I will support her as best I can moving forward.

'This is a devastating time. We had a wonderful marriage and I 
don’t want you to get the impression that Taylor and I are bitter enemies — 
we’re not.

'We have a beautiful five-year-old daughter who we both love.'

According to Radar Online, the businessman was also concerned over an alleged tell-all book, which was to include 'extensive details about Russell’s sexual indiscretions and preferences along with sordid secrets which could be deemed by some as deviant behaviour.'

His
 lawyer Ronald Richards told TMZ he was broke and had been staying at 
his friend's house on Mulholland Drive, where he was found.

He said: 'I feel bad because his credit cards weren't working. He had tremendous financial problems.

'He was also extremely bummed out about the divorce with Taylor.

'As far as a will, even if he does have a will, they don't have any assets, so I'm not sure what there would be left to leave.

'I am extremely saddened, I had no idea he was depressed.'

Ed Winter of the L.A Coroner’s Office said: 'He hung himself with no suicide note found.'

No drugs or alcohol were found in the bedroom where Russell died and he was fully clothed when his body was discovered.

His
 wife Taylor, 40, has accused him of calling her names, grabbing her, 
shoving her, pulling her hair and throwing objects at her, and had filed
 for divorce.

According to TMZ she is yet to reveal the heartbreaking news to their daughter.

Armstrong has had two separate restraining orders filed against by him.

The first was by his ex-wife Barbara and the other  came from an ex-girlfriend.

In addition, Armstrong has a criminal record, pleading guilty to battery in 1997.

Russell is survived by Kennedy, his 
five-year-old daughter with Taylor, and Aiden, a 13-year-old son from a 
previous marriage and a an 11-year-old son with former fiancee Milette 
Fields.
