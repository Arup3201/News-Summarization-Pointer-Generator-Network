A man whose New York City murder conviction was overturned after he spent over 20 years in prison is getting $3.6 million from the state.

The Daily News reports Saturday that state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman approved the payout this week in Anthony Yarbough's case.

Schneiderman spokeswoman Melissa Grace tells the paper Schneiderman has to ensure that people unjustly imprisoned get justice speedily.

Wrongly convicted: Anthony Yarbough (pictured) along with Sharrif Wilson were convicted of killing Yarbough's mother, his 12-year-old sister and another girl in 1992 and spent 20 years behind bars 

Yarbough's lawyer, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, says the state money will help Yarbough keep pursuing a lawsuit against the city. Margulis-Ohnuma says Yarbough plans to keep working at a hotel.

Yarbough and Sharrif Wilson were convicted of killing Yarbough's mother, his 12-year-old sister and another girl in 1992. A judge threw out their convictions in February based on new DNA evidence.

Yarbough and pal Sharrif Wilson were 18 and 15 when they were charged in 1992 with stabbing

Wilson's lawyer declined to comment.

'He won’t have to worry about money for quite a long time,' said Yarbough's lawyer, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma.

Yarbough's influx of cash will allow him to take a separate federal lawsuit against the city and the NYPD all the way to trial.

New evidence in the case helped to throw out the convictions in February and Yarbough filed a claim in June.

The New York Daily News reports that Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who approved the settlement this week, 'is concerned about the rights of the wrongfully convicted, and the obligation the State of New York has to ensure that people who were unjustly jailed — in some cases for decades — get some justice,' according to spokeswoman Melissa Grace.

'The office is working diligently to ensure that those who spent time behind bars get the justice they deserve as speedily as possible.'

Five months is supposedly the fastest payout an resolution for a case of its kind in history.
