There were five thousand people in Macksville, double the population of this New South Wales country town, for the funeral of Phillip Hughes. But the words of just one of them resonated around the cricketing world.

Michael Clarke proved himself more than the Australian captain as he addressed prime minister Tony Abbott and the family and friends of Hughes. He was a statesman.

Clarke was immense, as he has been ever since the tragic accident last week that rocked the cricket world and claimed the life of the close friend and team-mate he called his ‘little brother’.

Clarke made as moving and poignant a speech as any sportsman can ever have mustered. His words conveyed the perfect mix of grief, disbelief, warmth and inspiration in the still surreal aftermath of Hughes’ death at 25.

‘I don’t know about you but I keep looking for him,’ said Clarke as he gulped deep breaths and choked back tears. ‘I know it’s crazy but I expect any minute to take a call from him or to see him around the corner. Is this what we call the spirit? If so then his spirit is still with me and I hope it never leaves. His spirit has brought us closer together. He always wanted to bring people together and he always wanted to celebrate his love for the game and its people.

‘Is this what we call the spirit of cricket? From the little girl in Karachi holding a candlelight tribute to masters of the game like Tendulkar, Lara and Warne showing their grief to the world, the spirit of cricket binds us all together.

‘We must listen to it. We must cherish it. We must learn from it. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on. So rest in peace my little brother. I’ll see you out in the middle.’

The funeral of Hughes took place in Macksville on Wednesday as Australia remembered the batsman

A gathering which included the Australian team and greats such as Shane Warne, Ricky Ponting, Brian Lara and Sir Richard Hadlee applauded an Australian captain who was joined in speaking by members of the Hughes family.

Clarke was also a pall bearer at the service, as were Australian batsman Aaron Finch and South Australia’s Tom Cooper, who was batting with Hughes when he was struck on the back of his neck by a routine bouncer from Sean Abbott and collapsed at the SCG crease. The hugely popular Hughes never regained consciousness after suffering catastrophic brain damage.

Abbott was in the congregation, too, and it is the hope of the cricketing world, not least Hughes’ parents and his brother and sister, that he should in time be able to adhere to Clarke’s words and play on himself. He has already taken the small step of resuming training with New South Wales.

For now an Australian team that would have included Hughes will attempt to play on in the first Test next week against India, who were represented in Macksville by stand-in captain Virat Kohli and coach Duncan Fletcher.

There was no-one at the funeral, though, representing England. Nick Compton, a close friend of Hughes from their time at Middlesex, attended privately, as did Sam Robson, but there was no official ECB presence.

Hughes’ family wanted the majority of seats to be given to friends and Macksville residents so the ECB were told by Cricket Australia, in common with all the other Test boards, that it would be better if they attended the state memorial service that will be held at the SCG in the new year.

Instead, David Richardson, the International Cricket Council’s chief executive, represented the Test nations at a service at the Macksville Recreation Centre that opened to the song Forever Young by Youth Group and ended with Elton John’s Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me. 

Meanwhile, at the famous old SCG, which Clarke said will forever remain sacred as the ground where Hughes fell, the service was broadcast on a big screen and 63 bats were laid out on the turf to represent the score he had moved on to before his final innings was cut tragically short.

Cricket will never quite be the same after this.

Certainly there will be a huge shadow over the forthcoming World Cup in Australia and next year’s Ashes. But, as Clarke said, cricketers will play on around the world. They have to.

And the Australian captain will always be respected for his handling of a situation that no sportsman should ever find themselves in.
