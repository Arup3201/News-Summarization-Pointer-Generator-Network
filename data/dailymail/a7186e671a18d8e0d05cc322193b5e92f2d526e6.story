Simon Mignolet's fumble allowed Ludogorets to open the scoring on Wednesday night, and adds to a catalogue of unsure performances from the Belgian between the sticks this season.

Former Reds ‘keeper Bruce Grobbelaar has put the blame for Liverpool’s poor start to the season on Mignolet, who he says is 'worse than Dracula'.

'He doesn’t command his area,' Grobbelaar told BBC this week. 'I’ve likened Mignolet to worse than Dracula because at least Dracula comes out of his coffin now and then.'

Here's what Sportsmail's Martin Keown and Jamie Carragher think about Mignolet's situation.

'People were quick to defend Simon Mignolet for the opening goal, saying the ball bounced awkwardly in front of him, but he was at fault.

'Keepers warm up for such a long time these days so there must be something wrong with his preparation.

'It shouldn’t have been a surprise to him that the surface was uneven. He will know it was an awful mistake.

'He seems to have a big problem with long-range efforts - with another one hitting him in the face. Mignolet is having a tough time and he needs to do better.'

Jamie Carragher

'It's a major concern Liverpool just can't make a clean sheet now,' Carragher said, speaking on Sky Sports.

'It's another mistake for him and it's getting to the stage now... Lovren was taken out of the team tonight, he [Mignolet] probably needs the same at the moment. For his own good.

'The problem is, Brad Jones on the bench is not better than Mignolet, is that the answer?

'It's not just about a keeper, it's any player. Sometimes you think you'll play yourself out of the bad form, we've been there ourselves.

'Sometimes it is good to step back out of the limelight and let others have a go.' 

Jamie Carragher revealed his concern at Liverpool's inability to keep clean sheets this season

PS (Here's what Brendan Rodgers had to say) 

‘Hopefully it is not an issue with his confidence,’ said Rodgers, after Mignolet's recent criticism. ‘ It was a disappointment for the team because we wanted a solid start and to go behind so early very frustrating. 

‘The pitch was difficult for the outfield players and the goalkeepers; it was very bobbly, especially around the box. Thankfully it didn’t cost us overall and the players showed great character to come back.'
