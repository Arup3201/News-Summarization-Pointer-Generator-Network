Whoopi Goldberg reportedly has Rosie O'Donnell to thank for spoiling her plans to star in a new sitcom.

According to multiple reports, Goldberg was expected to exit The View after being cast in comedian Jermaine Fowler's new ABC prime-time series, Delores and Jermaine.

But when Rosie O'Donnell departed from the talk show last week, ABC network executives allegedly withdrew their offer to Goldberg in order to keep her on as the moderator of The View.

Page Six reported Wednesday that the decision was made before President's Day weekend.

Delores and Jermaine is based on the life of Jermaine Fowler. The sitcom stars the comedian as an ambitious but unmotivated millennial who moves in with his grandmother, a tough-talking, football-obsessed retired Washington DC police officer.

Entertainment Weekly reported that Danny Chun, of The Simpsons and The Office, will write and executive produce the show alongside Fowler, Avi Gilbert and Michael Rotenberg.

If the sitcom were picked up by the network for a full season, it would have been Goldberg's first series since her show, Whoopi, ended in 2004 after only one season.

Goldberg has been the moderator on The View since 2007, when she replaced O'Donnell after her first turbulent eight-month stint on the program.

On Tuesday, Goldberg addressed the remours swirling around her career plans, telling the paper that ABC has always been willing to accommodate her side projects, and that her contract with the network allows her to take on movie and TV roles.

Speaking at a fashion show in New York, the veteran talk show host revealed that she has been trying to join the cast of the new drama Empire on Fox, but ABC wants her to do another show. She did not specify whether the project in question was Delores and Jermaine.

'But it’s a lot of work to go and do two or three jobs at the same time,’ Goldberg told the paper. ‘I’m getting older, and I don’t want to work that hard. So we’ll see how it all works out.’

An anonymous source within ABC has denied that Goldberg has been pulled from the new sitcom, calling the claims' hilarious,' reported the New York Daily News.   

The View moderator also said that she was ‘very happy’ with her current arrangement.

‘I never put down the fact that I have a really good job, but I also have bosses. They make decisions,’ she added.

Rosie O'Donnell made her exit from The View last Thursday in a segment that lasted barely 40 seconds. She thanked the show's creator, Barbara Walters, for having her on twice.

She announced last weekend she was leaving. O'Donnell, who is going through a divorce and has had a heart attack, said she needed to reduce the stress in her life.

Her outsized personality brought the usual tabloid rumors of backstage strife at the daytime talk show. O'Donnell had returned to The View in September, part of a revamp aimed at stopping a ratings slide, joining Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace on the panel.
