David Weir has been named in the Great Britain marathon team for the IPC World Championships this year.

The event will be staged on April 26 at the Virgin Money London Marathon ahead of the championships themselves in Doha in October.

The four-time London 2012 gold medallist will be aiming to win his first title in British colours since the Paralympics and claim a record seventh London Marathon triumph.

He said: 'Just a second separated the top three last year and I'm sure it's going to go down to the wire again in 2015.

'The race will give me a real gauge of what I need to do between now and Rio to make sure that I can add to the six gold medals I've won at Paralympic Games.'

Shelly Woods, Jade Jones, Simon Lawson, Derek Rae and Rob Smith are the other athletes in the six-strong British team.
