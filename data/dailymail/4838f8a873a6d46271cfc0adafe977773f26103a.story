A climber died after he fell more than 100ft down an icy mountain in Snowdonia earlier today.

The unnamed man was 2,500ft high on Glyder Fawr above the Ogwen Valley when he lost his footing on the frozen slopes.

An RAF Sea King helicopter was called to the scene but despite the crew’s attempt to revive the man he was pronounced dead upon arrival in hospital.

Danger: Conditions in Snowdonia, pictured this week, has been described as 'treacherous' by local rescue teams after the fourth incident this week saw one man die in a fall

The helicopter was sent from RAF Valley in Anglesey where Prince William is based, but it has not been confirmed whether William, or Flight Lieutenant Wales as the Prince is known the base, was involved in the rescue mission.

Shortly afterwards the team were called to nearby Carnedd Dafydd where a hiking couple found they were unable to continue their holiday walk due the snow conditions.

The Sea King helicopter arrived to aid the couple, who were located on a walking route 2,000ft up in the mountains.

The crew initially struggled to locate the pair, but were eventually able to connect with their mobile phone line.

The man and woman, in their late 20s, were winched into the Sea King then flown to the mountain rescue base in the Ogwen Valley.

These are the third and fourth incidents in the past week where mountaineers have fallen victim to the icy conditions in Snowdonia.

A man from Coventry broke his arm after he slid about 300ft while descending the Snowdon Horseshoe in Lliwedd on Thursday.

Less than 24 hours earlier a 53-year-old local man fell 100ft while climbing on Snowdon mountain.

Local rescuers are warning climbers to go into the mountains over the Easter weekend due to the 'treacherous' conditions

Chris Lloyd of Ogwen mountain rescue team said: ‘Conditions are 
hazardous. There is a risk of powdered snow avalanche and there is also a
hard crust.’

'Our message is unless you are 
well-equipped and know what you are doing, please stay away over from 
high in the mountains over the weekend,' Phil Benbow, secretary of the 
Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team told the BBC.
