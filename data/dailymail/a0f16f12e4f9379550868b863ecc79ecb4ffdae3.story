It may be the busiest night of the year for fun-lovers - but Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson was safely tucked up in bed on New Years Eve - at least according to his son Willie.

Speaking for the first time since his father's anti-gay and racially offensive comments to GQ magazine, Willie, who is the business brains behind the $400 million Duck Dynasty empire, revealed that his controversial father prefers to give Holiday Season partying a miss.

Explaining that New Year's Eve isn't a big deal to his dad, Willie said that he was in bed and his wife Korie added that if he was watching anything it would be Fox News.

Speaking from Colorado, where they are skiing, Willie and his wife steered well clear of any further contentious issues which could cause the recent furore over his father's comments to flare up again.

Asked about his father's suspension and subsequent reinstatment by A&E for quoting Biblical passages which compared homosexuality to bestiality, Willie Roberston said that 'A&E and us are fine.'

'We are just glad to be back at work and ready to break in a new year and start making fun shows

'We are ready to move on and we have all learned a lot.'

Indeed, the Robertson family and A&E - which is owned by Disney and the Heast Corporation - have created a merchandising empire worth hundreds of millions since the shows launch in 2012.

Asked what 2014 held for the Roberston's, Willie said that the family and their patriarch are looking forward to 'more of the same' and will 'stick together.'

 

During their second exclusive interview with hosts Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Bill Hemmer following the ball drop at Times Square, Willie and Korie Robertson were teased about their first kiss of 2014.

As the couple indulged the Fox host, country star Luke Bryan photo-bombed the shot and tried to lean in and give Willie Robertson a kiss.

'Let me get a kiss!' Bryan said, grabbing Robertson’s face, but failing to land a smooch.

Speaking further about the future of Duck Dynasty, Korie said, 'We’ve been so blessed in 2013 that you know, I think I just hope it continues. We’re going to stick together as a family, and doing what we’re doing, and giving God the glory.'

For his part, Willie said, 'Hopefully my employees will keep up with more duck calls while I’m way. Nobody has been putting together duck calls since I’ve been gone. I have to get back and crack the whip.'

The son of Phil Robertson concluded by promising, 'I’m going take better care of my beard this year than last year. More lotions and oils. I need to get back to the beard.'

Just last week on the reinstatement of his father to A&E's Duck Dynasty, Willie Robertson took to Twitter to attempt to explain away the family patriarch's coarse views.

'Describing his dad as 'Ole Phil', Willie said that he 'may be a little crude but his heart is good. He's the Real Deal!'

And in an exclusive statement to FoxNews on Friday, the family said they were 'excited to keep making a quality TV show for our dedicated fans, who have showed us wonderful support. We will continue to represent our faith and values in a positive way through Duck Dynasty and our many projects that we are currently working on.'

'The outpouring of support and prayers has encouraged and emboldened us greatly,' the family added.

The network said in a statement last week that they planned to reinstate Phil on the reality show after discussions with the Robertson family and consultations with 'numerous advocacy groups'.

Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus two weeks ago by A&E in response to the uproar following the GQ magazine interview.

But despite consulting advocacy groups, many spoke out against Phil's reinstatement - the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination (GLAAD) issuing a statement yesterday to Fox News saying it the network is just greedy to capitalize off the hit show.

'Phil Robertson should look African American and gay people in the eyes and hear about the hurtful impact of praising Jim Crow laws and comparing gay people to terrorists. If dialogue with Phil is not part of next steps then A+E has chosen profits over African American and gay people – especially its employees and viewers,' the said.

The fourth season is set to premiere this January, and was largely completed before Phil made the statements, meaning he didn't miss a single episode of filming during the ban.

The removal of the 67-year-old patriarch from the show was lauded by gay rights organizations, but fans of the show denounced it as a violation of Robertson's right to free speech.

Conservative supporters include Sarah Palin, who wrote in a Facebook post: 'Free speech is an endangered species. Those intolerants’ hatin’ and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.'

A&E initially took action after Robertson's comments caused uproar, saying his views were 'disappointing' and that A&E has always been 'strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.'

Now, the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch's remarks.

'While Phil’s comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs, and his own personal journey, he and his family have publicly stated they regret the “coarse language” he used and the mis-interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article.

'He also made it clear he would 'never incite or encourage hate'. We at A+E Networks expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article, and reiterate that they are not views we hold,' read the statement.

The homophobic comments from the born-again Christian included such insights as, ' 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s anus.

'That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.'

He also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who’s going to heaven, hell. That’s the Almighty’s job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they’re homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I’m saying?'

GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a ‘stain’ on the network A&E which airs the show.

GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz told E! News: 'Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe.

'He clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans - and Americans - who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples.

'Phil's decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E and his sponsors who now need to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT people and families.'

In addition to his anti-gay rhetoric, the duck hunter also made dubious remarks regarding Louisiana before the Civil Rights Movement.

'I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field,' said Robertson.

'They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, 'I tell you what: These doggone white people'—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.'
