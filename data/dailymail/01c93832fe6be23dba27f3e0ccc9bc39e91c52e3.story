The armed robber who escaped from prison after his Russian lover hijacked a helicopter and airlifted him out of the jail exercise yard is appealing to have one of the conditions of his parole changed, lifting a ban on the pair from having any contact.

John Killick and Lucy Dudko pulled off one of Australia's most notorious breakouts when Dudko forced a helicopter pilot at gunpoint to land in the compound of Silverwater jail in 1999.

The infamous couple cherished the 45 days they spent together before being caught and banned from seeing each other until 2022 - when he will be 80 years old and she will be 64. The former jailbirds have not seen each other for 15 years.

Killick, who was released in 2014 after serving 15 years for a string of armed robberies, is appealing to have his 24 hour electronic ankle monitor, and the ban on seeing Dudko, removed when he appears before the NSW parole authority hearing on Friday,The Sun Herald reported.

They are are both writing books about their love affair which lasted 10 years and Killick says he wants to talk to the former librarian about the contents of her story.

Killick says his risk of re-offending has been assessed at one out of 22.

'This isn't about Lucy and I being a threat to society the moment we catch up for coffee; this is about revenge. For what happened in that prison yard … for embarrassing them,' he said. 

While Dudko spent a decade at Mulawa women's prison she sent an astounding 4,500 love letters to Killick, who was serving the rest of his time at Goulburn jail.

However, the relationship turned sour  when Dudko told him in 2005 that she had 'rediscovered' her faith and his said he didn't 'buy' most of what was written in the bible.

Two weeks later, Dudko called off their relationship.

Dudko told The Sun- Herald in 2009 that she had 'moved on' from that part of her life.

'My life was like a soap opera back then but slowly I've managed to put it all behind me," she said.

'It doesn't help to relive what happened, so I try not to.'

Killick, who completed a Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program for his gambling habit which led him to commit armed robberies in 1966, 1972, 1981 and 1985, said he would like to see his long time lover again.

'I still believe there is a unique bond there. And I would need her to look me in the face and say there is not … for me to ever believe otherwise,' he said. 

The couple planned the great escape when Dudko's visited the prison three times a week

In an interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night last year, Killick revealed just what happened on the day, and during the weeks following, he and his girlfriend made the daring escape.

In 1999, Killick was imprisoned in Silverwater jail, serving time for a series of armed bank robberies. His girlfriend, a librarian originally from Russia, went to see him in jail as often as she could.

It was during these visits the pair decided that Killick would break out of prison.

'She was visiting me all the time and you can get three visits a week and she came out three times a week. I rang her as often as I could. And we decide "look um I’m going to get out,"' Killick told the program.

In preparation for Killick's escape, Dudko took a joy ride over the site where Sydney Olympic Park was being constructed in the lead up to the 2000 Olympic Games. 

Pilot Timothy Joyce also spoke to the program, and told of the moment Killick's lover held a gun to his head

The night before the big day, Dudko ate dinner at the home of Killick's former wife Gloria, where she had been staying since her lover had been locked up.

In another curious detail, the criminal revealed his girlfirend had hired the 1975 action film Breakout, about a woman who hires a pilot to break her husband out of jail and watched it in the week before the real thing.

On March 25, 1999, the Russian librarian jumped in a plane with helicopter pilot Timothy Joyce, under the guise of another scenic tour.

Joyce recounted the moment he knew something was awry, as Dudko was paying particular attention to Silverwater jail.

'I looked over my shoulder... and as I looked back she had pulled a pistol out of her purse and she put it to the side of my head and said "this is a hijack",' the pilot revealed.

The helicopter hijacked was a Bell 47, and Joyce was tied up after he was forced to land the aircraft

From there Joyce was forced to land in the grounds of the jail, while Killick jumped in the aircraft and prison officers fired shots in his direction.

He flew the couple about 7 kilometres from the facility, before he was forced to land and tied up the pair who were now on the run.

Killick and Dudko were then forced to flag down a car and hijack it, as Killick recalled his lover admitted 'We have no car - I've forgotten the keys'.

The fugitives drove the vehicle to North Sydney station where they dumped it and jumped on a train to Goulburn, well aware they would have officers hot on their tails.

Killick was only released last year after serving time for a string of armed robberies and the helicopter escape

For 45 days the couple managed to avoid authorities, as they slowly made their way south to Victoria, changing hair colour along the way and travelling by bus and train.

Their downfall came when they ran out of money and were forced back to Sydney to reclaim money from one of Killick's criminal friends who owed him cash.

In a caravan park on the outskirts of Sydney they were cornered and arrested, and Killick was only released from jail for the daring escape last year.

In July last year, he handed himself in to Brisbane police after he lost a case to be extradited from New South Wales. Killick must now abide to extremely tough parole conditions and wears an ankle monitor full time.
