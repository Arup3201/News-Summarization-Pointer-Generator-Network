She's been caught committing a number of driving offences and it's all on camera.

The woman was driving hands-free, trying to juggle a McFlurry ice-cream whilst also picking up and checking her mobile phone on Wednesday.

And the driver did all this whilst travelling 100km/h on Melbourne's Monash freeway - one of Australia's busiest freeways, reports A Current Affair.

The woman looks at ease as she shovels ice-cream into her mouth whilst sitting in her black hatchback.

Footage then shows the irresponsible driver briefly looking away from the road, still driving with no hands, as she checks her mobile phone.

Victoria's highway patrol cop, Inspector David Griffin, says this in unacceptable behaviour.

'Look it's really disappointing, it's frustrating and it makes some of us angry,' he said.

From the shocking vision, Inspector Griffin says she will be handed a significant penalty and four demerit points from her license for holding her mobile phone.

She may also be charged for careless driving.

A Current Affairs reported that an estimated 23 per cent of crashes are caused by distractions like mobile phones.

They also revealed 28 per cent drivers admitted sending or reading text message,  55 per cent of them being women aged between 18-24.

Victoria police are investigating the matter and are trying to identify the driver.
