President Obama made time for beer and billiards in Colorado, but won't go near a humanitarian crisis in Texas, a disgusted Democratic member of Congress from the Lone Star State said Wednesday.

Rep. Henry Cuellar crossed his party to say he is 'very very upset' with Obama for choosing a photo op with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper over a chance to see firsthand how his administration is handling a flood of young illegal immigrants who have trekked to the U.S. from three Central American countries.

'He's so close to the border. And let me say this: when I saw, and I hate to use the word bizarre, but under the circumstances, when he is shown playing pool in Colorado, drinking a beer, and he can't even go 242 miles to the Texas border?'

Cuellar added that the federal government is 'holding some of the young kids from the border' at Lackland Air Force Base. 'He could at least make that trip to San Antonio,' he said.

'He either can roll up his sleeves and go down to the border, or he can just look aloof and detached and not go to the border – send surrogates down there – and say that he's got everything under control.'

'It Just floored me,' a visibly perturbed Cuellar told MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, 'because if he’s saying he's too busy to go down to the border, but you have time to drink a beer, play pool – the optics and the appearance just mean he's not paying attention to this humanitarian crisis.'

Cuellar told Fox News on Wednesday morning that the White House has already pressured him to keep quiet.

Obama will be in Texas on Wednesday afternoon and evening for Democratic Party fundraisers in Dallas and Austin. It's as close to the crisis as he's traveled since the human deluge became a public scandal.

During the first speech of his two-day trip, Obama didn't mention the border situation, saying only that his flavor of 'immigration reform' is 'supported by a majority of Americans.'

MailOnline was first to report last week that the president would steer clear of the state's besieged border with Mexico.

Arizona Democratic Rep Raúl Grijalva said Tuesday on the same network that that the Southwest U.S. border 'deserved a presidential visit.'

I think a visit by the president is reaffirming that the borderlands along the southwest border are vital and important to this nation,' he said, 'so I think a visit would be important and very symbolic.'

'This issue isn't going to go away ... while he's in Austin and Dallas,' Grijalva insisted.

Buzzfeed on Wednesday quoted unnamed Democratic members of Congress who called Obama's failure to see the border crisis firsthand 'confusing,' 'baffling' and 'a little offensive.'

Washington Post scribe Ruth Marcus added on MSNBC that 'it's a little bit weird, because it seems like he is already in a hole, and he's keeping on digging.'

Obama is behind the eight ball not only because of his casual game of pool with the Colorado governor, but also because of Republicans' claims that his 2012 immigration policy shift created the humanitarian disaster.

He declared a two-year moratorium that summer on deporting illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. Another two-year delay was announced last month.

Reports have swirled during the spring and summer that opportunistic human smugglers misinterpreted the policy to make Central Americans believe their own children could escape endemic violence and poverty by making a dangerous trip to the north.

As if a thank-you for the inspiration to come to America, some illegal immigrant children have reportedly been entering the U.S. wearing Obama-themed sneakers featuring 'Yes We Can' artwork and the president's face.

Online commentator Dennis Michael Lynch first published the photos on Facebook, later adding on his website that they came from someone affiliated with U.S. Border Patrol.

'These pictures were taken from a friend who works at the processing center in South Texas,' read a note that Lynch said he received with the images. 'These are being worn by an illegal who will soon be released into the general public.'

'For people who may think this is a fake picture, notice the shoe laces. We make everyone remove their laces.'

A few Democrats are publicly sticking up for the White House, most notably the far-left Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who said on CNN that a White House request for $3.7 billion in supplemental funding was the best course.

'The president knows Texas very well. I’m very confident he’s attending to serious issues by putting forth the supplemental,' she said.

'He’s going to meeting with local officials, some of whom I’ve already spoken to. We have been to the border, many of us. His cabinet members have been to the border. I think we will see that visit as time proceeds.'

Obama will meet with 'local elected officials and faith leaders' about the border crisis in Dallas before his first political fundraising engagement on Wednesday, according to the White House.

As that meeting began, the White House hastily announced that Obama would deliver public remarks less than an hour later about the border crisis.

He will also make time for a private sit-down with Texas Gov. Rick Perry.

NBC News reported, however, that Obama's handlers said he would 'get in the way' of Border Patrol efforts if he went.

'It's a no-win situation in some ways,' network White House correspondent Kristin Welker said Wednesday.

'If he goes there, what does he do? Does he give a speech? Does he meet with the children?'

Republicans in Congress continue to point out a connection between America's porous southern border and Obama's repeated demands for 'comprehensive immigration reform.'

Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith said Tuesday that Obama's $3.7 billion request should go unanswered until his administration spends its existing budget to secure the border.

'This isn’t a funding problem,' Smith said on Capitol Hill. 'It’s an enforcement problem. Rather than enforce our nation’s immigration laws, the president has chosen to ignore them. Instead he continues to call for massive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.'

Obama, he said, 'has no one to blame but himself for the current crisis on the southern border. He granted amnesty to illegal immigrant minors by promising not to deport those brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.

'As a result, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants are now flooding across the border.'

Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn added on CNN that for a fraction of the White House's request, Congress could repatriate each of the illegal immigrant children – in style.

'Look, for $8 million, we can put them all on a first-class seat back to their homes,' he said on the Crossfire program. 'That's $8 million. That's a first-class seat, one way, to each of their homes.'
