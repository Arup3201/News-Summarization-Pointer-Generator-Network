A couple dressed as the undead to tie the knot in their dream zombie-themed wedding.

Horror fans Jennifer Jones and Rob Blackmore shuffled down the aisle after being transformed into flesh eating creatures normally found in Hollywood horror movies.

Guests joined in with the fun of the theme dressing in suitably ghoulish attire and applying theatrical 'undead' make-up - even 'zombifying' a small child.

Warehouse assistant Rob, 31, said: 'Ever since I was a child in the 1980s and saw my first zombie film, I was drawn to them.

'When technology grew and computer games came out, the first zombie game I played was Resident Evil. From there it just escalated and I became a huge fan. I've never played a zombie game I haven't liked.'

Jennifer, 27, said: 'My mum wasn't even surprised. Everyday is like Halloween for me. She loved the idea.'

Asked whether she had ever dreamed of a white wedding, Jennifer replied: 'It was never going to be like that. We wanted to get married on Halloween anyway so it was always going to be a spooky, creepy, weird wedding.'

The couple, from Stockbridge, Liverpool, were able to have the wedding they'd always wanted after winning a competition.

Organisers gave an open invitation to footballer Luis Suarez to attend the ceremony after he bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic during a Premier League match on Sunday.

But Jennifer said she would have 'tackled him and bit him first' had the Liverpool striker turned up for her big day.

More than 250 people gathered for the unorthodox ceremony at One Mayfair in central London.

The couple had entered a Facebook competition to win a zombie wedding organised by the makers of new video game Dead Island Riptide.

They beat dozens of applicants by impressing the judges with their enthusiasm for the game series.

The ceremony was decorated as a hellish Caribbean paradise - a theme that runs through the Dead Island series of games.

Live music was provided by 'zombified' band Mariachi Mexteca, while the couple were set to whisked away for a honeymoon in the Caribbean.Â
