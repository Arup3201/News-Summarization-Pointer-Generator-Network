Scientists have been forced to invent monitoring technology to protect dolphins from being killed while swimming through military training waters, it was revealed today.

Conservationists feared the bottlenose dolphins were at risk from laser-guided missiles when their family pods swim into Ministry of Defence explosive trials at Aberporth in Cardigan Bay, Wales.

But a team of experts at defence firm QinetiQ created a special listening system to find the dolphins - and can now hear their distinctive clicking sounds from more than 20 miles away.

And thanks to the company’s Passive Acoustic Monitoring (Pam) system, when a pod of dolphins is heard entering a missile testing area, all firing is stopped to let them pass through safely.

The detection of marine life in the area had previously relied on remote camera systems and visual observations by aircrew, because nobody else can enter the area during a missile trial.

But Pam uses an underwater microphone known as a hydrophone and processing equipment to identify the sounds made by marine mammals, which QinetiQ says is robust and cost-effective.

The system has been in use for two years at the MoD testing zone, which is a conservation area and has the largest population of protected bottlenose dolphins in Europe.

They are also one of only two significant
 populations in Britain. It is an offence under existing law to 
deliberately kill, injure or disturb European marine protected species.

A People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesman told MailOnline: 'Animals do not wage war, so why should they suffer because humans do?

'Wars are human endeavours, but just 
like civilians, animals can easily become victims. For animals, there 
are no Geneva Conventions and no peace treaties - just our mercy.

'Our troops deserve the best protection, and animals deserve to be left out of human conflict.'

QinetiQ, which manages the range under a 
long-term partnering agreement, won the top environmental prize at the 
MoD’s annual Sanctuary Awards for its dolphin detection technology.

Competition
 judge Jane Hallett said: ‘This project demonstrated an innovative 
approach to an emerging issue within marine conservation.

‘It shows how defence requirements can be successfully integrated with environmental responsibility.’

The
 award citation said: 'This is an excellent example of how the proactive
 management of noise can enable the MoD to continue its business and 
conduct live explosive trials.'

A QinetiQ spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The MOD Aberporth range has a rich and diverse history of innovation and problem solving.

‘The
 development of the PAM system is an excellent example of this 
creativity and technical expertise being used to protect the natural 
resources in and around Cardigan Bay.’

Separately,
 in May, the Royal Navy was blamed for driving dozens of dolphins to an 
agonising death during anti-submarine war games.

A four-year investigation by scientists 
ruled out every other cause for the UK’s largest stranding of common 
dolphins in shallows off the coast of Cornwall in 2008.

The area was hosting a week of ‘live fire’ war games involving 20 Royal Navy ships, helicopters and submarines - including the nuclear-powered sub HMS Torbay - as well as 11 foreign vessels.

And scientists believed trials of anti-submarine warfare techniques, using a range of mid-frequency sonar devices in the water to detect hidden vessels, were the most likely cause of the deaths. But the Navy rejected the investigation’s findings.

In August, two studies were released in America suggesting US Navy training and testing could inadvertently kill hundreds of whales and dolphins and injure thousands over the next five years.

Most of the deaths would come from explosives, though some might come from testing sonar or animals being hit by ships.

According to the reports, computer models show it may kill 186 whales and dolphins off the East Coast and 155 off Hawaii and Southern California.
