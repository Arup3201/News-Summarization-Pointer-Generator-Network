A mother who put the seven-year-old boy she adopted on a plane to his native Russia with a note saying she no longer wanted him, has been sued for unpaid child support.

Torry Hansen, a 34-year-old nurse, has repeatedly failed to appear in court and at depositions involving the care of Artem Saveliev, now nine.

Circuit Court Judge Lee Russell in Tennessee ruled that she must pay child support for the boy whom she sent back to Russia alone in April 2010.

Rejection: Torry-Ann Hansen, from Tennessee, plays with her adoptive son Artem at the Vladivostok orphanage. She sent him back in Moscow alone in 2010 with a note saying she did not want him

A lawsuit filed by the adoption 
agency demanded child support and other damages that will be held in a 
trust for Artem, who now lives in a group home in a Moscow suburb.

Hansen took the little boy from an orphanage and gave him a new life with her in Shelbyville in 2009.

Less than a year later, she decided she did not want the child anymore and packed him on a ten-hour flight to Moscow with a note 'to whom it may concern' saying: 'I no longer wish to parent this 
child'.

She claimed the child was 'mentally 
unstable' and that his problems were hidden from her by Russian 
orphanage officials before she adopted him.

Heartbreak: Artem now lives at a group home in Moscow. The director of the orphanage says he 'tries to forget' about his life in the U.S.

'He
 is violent and has severe psychopathic issues/behaviour. I was lied to 
and misled by the Russian orphanage workers and director regarding his 
mental stability,' Hansen wrote.Â 

The adoption agency, World Association 
for Children and Parents, had sued Hansen for breach of contract and child support for the boy.

At an earlier court appearance on 
February 23, attorney Larry Crain said Artem was still an American 
citizen and Hansen was still legally his mother under U.S. law - although
 the adoption was revoked in Russia.

The judge will hear arguments in May as to how much money Hansen should pay to the child she rejected.

The adoptive mother was never 
criminally charged in the case that sparked outrage and caused a near 
diplomatic row between Russia and the U.S.

Hansen has moved to California, although her exact whereabouts were unknown, the court was told.

She has refused to talk to investigators since April 2010 when she sent Artem, then known as Justin Hansen, alone on the ten-hour flight with a backpack full of candy and coloring pencils.

Artem has been living for the past few months at SOS Village in the Moscow suburb of Tomilino, according to village director Anatoly Vasilyev.

Although technically an orphanage, it provides a home and family environment to children who have lost hope of being adopted.

Children aged from seven to 16 are watched over at the centre by a woman who also doubles as a teacher.

Mr Asilyev said Artem 'tries to forget about his life in the States', and that was the reason why the orphanage was not allowing the media to see him.

He added that he gets along well with other children and has almost forgotten English, preferring not to speak it.

Torry Hansen's mother Nancy recently said she did not believe Artem was traumatized by being sent home alone on the flight to Russia.

Mrs Hansen said: 'All I can say he was very happy when he was on the plane.

'Witnesses have said that he was running all around and he was happy. There were stewardesses watching over him.'
