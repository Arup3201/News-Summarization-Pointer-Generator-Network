Ronnie O’Sullivan made light of his broken ankle to clinch a 6-3 win over Peter Lines and book his place in the last 32 of the Coral UK Championship.

Sullivan was far from his fluent best at the York Barbican Centre, but still knocked in a highest break of 106 as he proved too good for his 44-year-old opponent.

His participation had been in doubt after he suggested after a first-round win over Daniel Wells that he might have to withdraw from the tournament.

But he wrote on Twitter he was 'gonna give the ankle a go' against Leeds potter Lines and the injury did not prove too great a hindrance.

The four-time UK champion moved into a 3-0 lead after a scrappy opening three frames, the highest break 54 in the third.

Lines took the fourth, but the five-time world champion turned on the style in the next, producing a run of 106.

He edged the sixth frame to move within one of victory, but Lines delayed the inevitable by reducing the deficit to 5-3 before a break of 74 saw O’Sullivan over the line.

Next up for O’Sullivan is a meeting with Ben Woollaston.

Lines, who went 3-0 down early on,  battled back to 5-3 before O'Sullivan pulled away to victory 

Earlier in the day, Neil Robertson paid a poignant tribute to fellow Australian Phillip Hughes before battling back from the brink of defeat to stay in the competition.

The 32-year-old, a big cricket fan who enjoyed making an unprecedented century of centuries on the baize last season, brought out a bat along with his cue for his second-round clash with Kyren Wilson.

Melbourne-born Robertson was joining in the appreciation of Hughes which has come from around the world of sport since the batsman’s death on Thursday.

The bat stayed out in the arena with defending champion Robertson, who at one stage looked to be heading out of the tournament but scraped a 6-5 win.

Robertson fell 5-4 behind when Wilson made 87 in the ninth frame and, when the 22-year-old English potter fluked the final red in the next, he had a clear match-winning opportunity. Yet Wilson fluffed a crucial positional shot from green to brown and a relieved Robertson was able to pot brown and blue to force the decider.

Wilson had the first chance of the all-important 11th frame, but missed a tricky red and left a half-decent chance. Robertson showed why offering him any such opening is a mistake by rattling in an 86 break to secure a pass to the third round.

Robertson later explained that carrying the bat in honour of Hughes gave him added focus at the end of his match against Wilson.

He told reporters in a press conference: 'I noticed a lot of other Australian sportsmen doing it over the weekend. It was nice to be able to pay tribute.

O'Sullivan tweeted a picture of his broken left ankle on Tuesday

'It was a really good opportunity for me to do that and show my respect to him and his family.

'I guess it made me just a bit more motivated to stick in there and try to get the win today.'

Elsewhere, Mark Allen played brutal hardball as he swatted aside Belgian teenager Luca Brecel.

The 28-year-old Northern Irishman, runner-up in York three years ago, beat Brecel 6-0 to reach the last 32.

Other winners on Sunday included Peter Ebdon, Stephen Maguire, Shaun Murphy and Ken Doherty.
