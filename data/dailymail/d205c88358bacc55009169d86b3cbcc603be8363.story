Britain's shortest double yellow lines have appeared on a city's street - measuring little over a foot long.

Two sets of double yellow lines measuring just 13 inches long apiece have been painted in between parking spaces on a residential road in Cambridge.

Cambridge County Council say the lines, which beat the previous shortest double yellows by a good four inches, are to deter drivers from encroaching on disabled parking bays.

If motorists park on the new lines they will incur a £70 fine.  But local residents say the new markings 'defy logic' and are simple waste of time and taxpayers' money.

Liz Hazell, 51, lives on Humberstone Road near Cambridge city centre, where the lines have been painted.

She said: 'It's the craziest set of double yellow lines I have ever seen.  It just defies logic as to why they bothered painting them on the road.'

Her son Nik, 21, who helped row Oxford's reserve vessel Isis to victory in last weekend's Varsity boat race, added: 'It's ridiculous. I have no idea why they have done that. You can't even fit a remote control car on it.'

Councillor Rob Dryden, a former mayor of Cambridge, also branded the new road markings 'rididulous', adding: 'Perhaps a child with a toy car could park there, but nothing else could.'

Cambridgeshire County Council said: 'This is common practice.

'I think they're cute': City councillor Damien Tunnacliffe hopes the lines will become a tourist attraction

'The yellow lines are at either end of a disabled parking bay and are there to prevent vehicles parked either side from encroaching on the disabled bay.'

Councillor Damien Tunnacliffe said he hoped the lines would become an attraction for visitors.

He said: 'I think they’re cute and could be on the tourist trail. We should get the blue badge tour guides onto it.'

The previous shortest double yellow line record was held by the city of Norwich, where residents woke up to find a set just 17 inches long in Stafford Street in 2011.

Council bosses also laid down 18 inch double yellow lines on parking bays in Highbury Crescent, North London, in 2007.

And last year Canterbury in Kent painted double yellow lines measuring just 21 inches.
