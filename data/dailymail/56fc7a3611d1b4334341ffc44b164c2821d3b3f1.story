A former Conservative candidate has resigned from the party after calling a group of feminists 'left-wing lesbo-groupies' on social media. 

Nick Morris, who describes himself as a Conservative 'activist', went on to call them 'cretins' in a later tweet.

He made the comments in response to a post by feminist campaigner @LiraelClayr who was tweeting about a campaign against male violence towards women.  

In the tweet, Mr Morris, who stood as a Conservative candidate for Sheffield Richmond in the 2004 Sheffield City Council elections said: 'Frankly I really dont care what you and leftwing lesbo-groupies think.'[sic]

He later posted: 'From what dark hole have these cretins crept from I wonder.' 

His remarks were made in relation to a project called 'Counting Dead Women' run by feminist Karen Ingala Smith that produces information about the number of women in the UK killed by their partners or sons. 

Last week she launched her Femiside Census: Profiles of Women Killed by Men - which records details of all the women murdered by men in Britain.

Twitter user @LiraelClayr, who wished to remain anonymous, told MailOnline: 'The tweet was offensive, but I wasn't overly surprised as I tend to receive a lot of abuse on Twitter. 

'The direct leap to calling a group of woman "lesbos" in my opinion was an attempt to diminish our words as if it was a shameful thing to be.

'Although I myself am not a lesbian, others included are and found it even more offensive as is their right.

'The gentleman apologised to me the next day and donated to a charity in way of that apology. I accepted the apology for myself but told him that others would accept or not accept as is their right. 

'As far as I'm aware several people are still cross about it.'  

Following a backlash on Twitter, Mr Morris hastily deleted the offensive tweets and his account. He has since resigned from the party. 

Nikki Bond, Labour party councillor in Sheffield and an active feminist, said it was 'pretty appalling'

He later issued a statement apologising for his remarks.

He said: 'It was a very foolish tweet which I have apologised for. There was no justification for it whatsoever.

'I have since resigned from the Conservative Party and the lady in question has accepted my apology.

'I've made a donation to a charity of her choice. It was sent on the spur of the moment and it certainly doesn't reflect my views. I'm deeply ashamed about my comment.' 

Nikki Bond, a Labour party councillor in Sheffield and an active feminist, said: 'Unfortunately I'm all too familiar with this kind of attitude.

'For anyone to have that kind of attitude is pretty appalling but for someone in a political role, where people are looking up to them for guidance, it is really important they do not come out with this sort of language.'
