An 81-year-old woman driver who was savaged in a road-rage attack says her assailant is less than human.

Patricia Pearson suffered a swollen lip, lumps to the forehead and cuts to her cheek as she drove to visit her husband at a care home.

'As far as I’m concerned he’s not a human being,' she said.

Usman Yasin, 30, who was sentenced to four months in prison after the attack in June this year, told magistrates at Burton, Staffordshire, that she was driving at 5mph, and claimed the frail pensioner, who is registered as disabled, landed the first blow.

Mrs Pearson relived the horror of a vicious road-rage attack which left her covered in blood and fearful for her own safety.

She said: 'He leathered into me. He got hold of my face and pulled my hair. He really set to me and was still using foul language.

'He got his hand and pushed it down the left-hand side of my face. I was bleeding then.

'He wanted to do what he wanted to do - regardless of me.'

Mrs Pearson told how she was travelling down All Saints’ Road to see her husband, Thomas, an 81-year-old dementia sufferer who lives in a Winshill Care Home, when Yasin roared up behind sounding his horn.

'My friend, Jimmy, said "there’s somebody at the back of you who wants to get around,"' said Mrs Pearson, then of Uxbridge Street, Burton, who has since moved.

'I said: "I don’t know if he’s trying to damage his car or mine".

'I could not go any faster because 
there were vehicles both sides. If I had I would have knocked people’s 
wing mirrors off.'

Yasin, of Broadway Street, Burton, eventually pulled 
in front and stopped.

'When I stopped, I got out of the car and went to his,' Mrs Pearson said.

'I opened his passenger door and leaned towards him and said "whatever is the matter with you?"'

Yasin responded with a volley of abuse, prompting his victim to say ‘less of your language’ and touched his nose with her hand.

In
the attack, which happened on June 17, Mrs Pearson sustained injuries 
including a cut on her forehead and top lip, and grazes to her face, 
cheek and elbow. She was treated at Burton’s Queen’s Hospital.

Four months after the attack she still suffers pain in her lips and neck, as well as psychological trauma.

'Now I’m a bit afraid that if I go to Burton I’m going to bump into him again,' Mrs Pearson said.

Yasin was jailed last week following a trial at Burton Magistrates’ Court. He had claimed self-defence.Mrs Pearson said his sentence was ‘neither a punishment nor a deterrent’.

'Everybody knows he will only do half.

'Half of 16 [weeks] is eight, so he will be home by Christmas,' she said.

'It’s a farce, an absolute farce - a waste of people’s money. My time was wasted and he’s now able to appeal.

'This country’s law is an ass.

'He should have been given more, [he should serve] at least three months in total.'

Mrs Pearson, a Birkenhead-born former Repton School cleaner, is in no mood to forgive Yasin.

'He’s obnoxious and should not be among the human race.'
