Jose Mourinho will continue to fret over the physical condition of his trio of centre-forwards as he plots for Sunday’s game at Manchester United.

Diego Costa did not train on Wednesday, Didier Drogba is operating at less than 100 per cent and Loic Remy came off against Maribor on Tuesday with a groin problem, although he refuses to rule himself out of the game at Old Trafford.

'I don’t think it’s too bad,' said Remy. 'I felt something in my groin. Fortunately I stopped playing because I felt something. It was a bit stiff. That’s why I prefer to come off.

Loic Remy scored the opener against Maribor on Tuesday night but was promptly replaced by Didier Drogba 

The Frenchman limped off after injuring his groin but remains confident he will be fit to face Manchester United 

'I have to care about myself and if I’m not feeling very good it’s better to leave for another player who is 100 per cent. It is frustrating because Costa is injured but I am not afraid. I don’t think it is really bad. I really hope to play again this weekend.'

Remy went for a scan on Wednesday but Mourinho has told his players he wants no injury news to leak out ahead of the game at Manchester United. He claims Costa has 'very little chance' but some will suspect kidology at play from the Chelsea manager.

Without Costa and Remy, Mourinho is likely to turn to Drogba, his 36-year-old warhorse, just back from an ankle injury and not in condition to play 90 minutes.

Diego Costa missed training on Wednesday and is a major doubt for the trip to Old Trafford this weekend

'I need time,' said Drogba. 'Before signing, I didn’t play for two or three months and then I had this injury. I need more games. But I’m training hard to be back to full fitness. I’m not fit yet but these games will help me improve.

'It’s up to the manager to decide who starts, but if you’re a player how would you feel if they say you can play at Old Trafford? You’ll be happy. To be able to enjoy these kind of moments is fantastic. We are lucky and if I play I will feel lucky one more time.'

Andre Schurrle who played at centre-forward for Chelsea at Old Trafford last year is ready to return after a virus and teenager Dominic Solanke is expected to keep his place in the squad.
