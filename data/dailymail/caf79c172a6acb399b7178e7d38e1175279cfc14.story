San Francisco's already tight housing market just got another squeeze after a tiny former earthquake shelter sold for $765,000 in October.

According to SF Gate, the 330-square-foot shack that sits on a quiet street in Telegraph Hill is one of the surviving properties built for earthquake victims in 1906. 

The US Army Corps of Engineers built the shacks in public spaces to house some of the 250,000 people displaced by the fires and quakes that struck the city. 

Shocking: A 330-square foot 'shack' in San Francisco sold for $765,000, which was $100,000 over the asking price

Floorplan: The design utilizes the space to create the illusion of separate dining and living rooms to give the home an open feel

Once those camps started to close, the Army allowed families to take the homes with them, on the condition they hauled them away themselves, which most did with the help of a mule or two. 

That doesn't mean that the new buyer is going to be living in a dilapidated shack, as this hardy home has been kept in great shape over the century it's stood in the city.

Its previous owner, an artist based in the city, recently renovated the interior, managing to economize the space without making it feel small.

Roomy: The emergency shelters were built after the Great Earthquake in 1906 and designed as simple shelters

Renovation: Many still survive, and have been given a modern update in order to keep their avant garde homeowners happy

Space: A recent renovation by the artist that owns the home tries to be economical with space without squeezing too tight

Up the staircase is where the new owner has their semi-enclosed bedroom, and a walk-in closet provides some storage space.

When the inside starts to feel like too much of a squeeze, there's an adjoining patio and a porch that's as pint-sized as the home. 

San Francisco's housing market has experienced some overheating during the last few years, as Silicon Valley's employees have snapped up the limited amount of real estate.

Living room: The space might not be enough to throw a rager, but an open floor plan gives it a great atmosphere for an intimate gathering

Cozy up: The semi-enclosed bedroom up a flight of stairs may not be to everyone's taste, but for some it will truly feel like home

Storage: A rolling door gives the walk-in closet a little more breathing room in spite of the low ceilings space at the top

Stretch out: When living in the small shack gets to be too tight, homeowners have a patio and a small elevated porch

According to the real estate site Zillow, the median price of a home sold in the city is $979,000, having hovered around $1million since it broke that record back in 2013. 

If you still have your heart set on one of the city's emergency shelters-cum-luxury properties, SF Curbed reports that a $1.15million shack in Bernal Heights went on the market earlier in the year. 

This one has a bit more space, with a garage, two full floors and ample room on the patio, as well as a solarium.
