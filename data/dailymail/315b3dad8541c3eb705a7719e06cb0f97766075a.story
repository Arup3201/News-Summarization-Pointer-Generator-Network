Is 2013 the year we finally make contact with our brothers from beyond the stars? One Youtube user certainly seems to think it's a possibility.

The user, danchek2013, has uploaded a video he claims shows footage of at at least one mysterious object zipping about over the surface of the moon.

One of the 'craft' emerges from the shadowy landscape of the moon's surface and then seemingly accelerates over the craters, before changing direction at breakneck speed and heading towards the bottom of the screen.

Intriguingly, it appears to leave vapour trails, similar to a plane, in its wake.

So are they faraway birds? Dust motes? Shooting stars? Or an advanced interstellar craft from an advanced civilization that has travelled from another galaxy to observe our planet?

Opinion is divided among the comments on the video.

Some believe the behaviour of the craft means it cannot be a human plane or flying creature

User 'King Dennis Jensen' said: 'At first I was like "meh﻿ another satellite" and then one more showed up faster than the other and it did all those swift angle movements.. Quite interesting indeed.'

Nathan5638 simply said: 'That's legit people!'

Commentor Aaliyah Martinez believes the speed of the turns bunks the idea that the vessel is of human origin.

She said: 'The g-force would in fact destroy whoever was on that craft. But we don't have that technology, so those aren't humans on the craft.'

Some, however, are a little more sceptical.

Deepcut66 called the video 'hilarious' adding: 'It could so easily be CGI (computer generated imagery).

'They are just little smudges.'﻿

David peck was a little more scathing.

He said: 'Geez, these vids are so stupid.'
