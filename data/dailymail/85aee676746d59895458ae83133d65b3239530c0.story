For Russell Brand, it seems being a self-styled anti-capitalist revolutionary really does pay the bills.

The left-wing comedian's new Revolution book has enjoyed monumental sales - earning the star and his publishers a staggering £230,000 in just 11 days.

The sales figures may further fuel his reputation as 'a champagne socialist' - a label he was given by Twitter users after ducking out of left-wing demonstrations in London on Wednesday night to head to an exclusive celebrity-packed West End party.

'Champagne socialist': Russell Brand was slammed on Twitter after ducking out of left-wing demonstrations in London on Wednesday night to head to an exclusive celebrity-packed West End party

Brand appeared on ITV's Lorraine this morning to promote his children's book , a version of the Pied Piper of Hamelin

Comic Russell Brand claims he is to record an Oasis song as a response to those who have been treating his rants like the lyrics to Blur hit Parklife.

The star has found that his Twitter messages featuring his thoughts on society have prompted others to add the word Parklife because they sound like the rambling lines of the Blur song released in 1994.

Brand said he was not offended by the mickey-taking but was planning to team up with Noel Gallagher to record a version of the hit Roll With It by Oasis, who were famously Blur's chart rivals and had a high profile battle to top the charts 19 years ago.

 

Since Dan Parker posted the tweet (top), social media users, including Nigel Farage, have mocked Brand for the wordy narrative in his book. Today the comedian failed to see the funny side as he responded to the Ukip leader

The joke, which came from Twitter user Dan Barker, was even retweeted by Nigel Farage today - and Brand quickly hit back at the Ukip leader showing a severe sense of humour failure. 

But in an interview with radio station Magic, he told presenter Jo Parkerson: 'I'm a comedian, and I make all my living out of mucking around and talking, and I've certainly tormented people in the past. So yeah, I don't mind that, I think - unless it's malicious.'

He pointed out that his sidekick from his old Radio 2 show, Matt Morgan, had similarly said 'Parklife' many years ago when he launched into a rant.

Brand went on: 'I don't know Damon Albarn particularly, but I've spoken to Noel Gallagher and we plan to respond with a Roll With It single. I'll say 'Roll with it' after every seven words.'

The comedian and actor said his old pal Gallagher would not be attending his live show at the Royal Albert Hall in London next week.

'I've not invited him, because he's not been supportive enough lately, ' he said. 'If he's seen anywhere near the vicinity, I'm going to have someone grab him by the eyebrow, tie a kite to it, and send him off into the ether.'

Official figures from Neilsen Bookscan show that the book has already sold 22,119 copies since its launch on October 23.

So far it has only been released in hardback and its retail price is £20 - although it is available at much cheaper on Amazon and other Internet sellers.

It is published by Century Publishing, whose owners Pearson PLC are the largest education company and book publisher in the world - and owners of the Financial Times. 

One publishing expert said: 'It's an awful lot of money to turnaround in such a short period.'

The book has been panned by critics who laid into the wordy comedian for his naïve and insulting views.

In the book, he questions why companies export cars, why Julian Assange is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy and compares the country's workers to Josef Fritzl's daughter.

On Wednesday night, Brand joined  thousands of masked anti-capitalist demonstrators as they descended on Westminster for a protest which saw scuffles with police.

The star - who quit drink and drugs 13 years ago - was spotted donning one of the Guy Fawkes masks widely used by members of radical groups.

Brand - who is worth £9million - said he wanted to see a 'loving, peaceful protest' and told activists: 'Stay cool, stay cool. I think you should be careful. Don't get beaten up and arrested tonight.'

He then left the protest early to join celebrities including fellow comedians Jimmy Carr and David Walliams in the West End for the press night of Made In Dagenham at the Adelphi Theatre.

Many took to Twitter to criticise the millionaire. Sophie Lak tweeted: 'Russell Brand loves a revolution but then leaves demonstration early to go to a celeb freebie party #fakeass.'

And Stephen Baker posted: 'I wonder if anti capitalism Russell Brand was driven there by his Chauffeur in the Merc? What a hypocrite.'

The star also came under criticism recently when it emerged that his film project is being backed by bankers.

Hefty profits: The comedian, thought to be worth around £9million, appeared on Lorraine today

It was revealed that Mayfair Film Partnership had raised nearly £1 million from wealthy capitalists including investment bankers and Premier League footballer Wes Brown to make the documentary about Brand. 

Investors were enticed with generous tax breaks to support the film, portraying Brand, 39, as a ‘troubled visionary’ seeking to change the world. 

He has previously called for an 'orgy of banker bashing'.

Talking about the financial crisis he added: 'When looking for the culprits look for the people who have got loads of bonuses and loads of money, they're the people that are criminal, they're the people that need to be prosecuted.' 

And in his book, Revolution, he calls for the abolition of debt and states saying: 'When people say, "the system works" they mean "the system works for me." The slags.'

He has previously declared on Newsnight: ‘David Cameron says profit isn’t a dirty word. Well I say profit is a filthy word.’ 

These trenchant positions appear at odds with his use of venture capital to finance the upcoming film as well as the hefty sum he will pocket from book sales.
