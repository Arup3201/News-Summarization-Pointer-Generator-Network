Britain's men's curling team emerged beaming as they went to collect their silver medals after a disastrous final.

The all-Scottish team had aimed to win Britain's first curling gold in 90 years.

But they were left disappointed as they crashed out of the running against a flawless Canada.

Happier: After a disastrous final, (L-R) David Murdoch, Greg Drummond, Scott Andrews, Michael Goodfellow, and Tom Brewster put on beaming smiles for the cameras as they collected their medals

Today, however, David Murdoch, Greg Drummond, Scott Andrews, Michael Goodfellow and Tom Brewster put on a united front as they waved at the crowds and smiled at the cameras.

With second place, and Team GB's fourth medal, they have at least surpassed the nation's best ever performance in a Winter Olympics, which came in Chamonix 1924.

Murdoch told BBC Sport: 'The pleasure outweighs the pain now.

Ceremony: They were led onto the stage with flowers by a fur-clad chaperone at the Medals Plaza

Success: Although the Scots had aimed to take Britain's first curling gold in 90 years, they upped Team GB's medal count to four, levelling with the nation's most successful Winter Olympics in 1924

'It was tough last night as we believed we could get gold.

'But you look back on this, to come away with silver, something we've chased for such a long time, it's been incredible.'

Team GB made it all the way to the final at the Ice Cube Curling Centre, before losing 9-3 to Canada.

They faced formidable competition with Brad Jacobs, Ryan Harnden, Ryan Fry and E.J. Harnden

Despite the defeat, curling has made great inroads in the British national consciousness.

There have been the hours of it on TV — Britain played about 30 hours in round-robin games, a play-off, semi-final and final to get their silver medal — and stories reached us of summer Olympic athletes being captivated by it.
