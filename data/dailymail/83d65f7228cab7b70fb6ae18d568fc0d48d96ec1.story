Tragedy: Popular teacher Frances Cappuccini died after giving birth to her second son Jack

A primary school teacher died after she was reluctantly persuaded to change her birth plan, a coroner's court heard.

Frances Cappuccini, 30, described as being 'hugely popular' among her pupils, died a few hours after giving birth to her son Jack by emergency Caesarean on October 9 last year.

Jack, who weighed 7lb 15oz when he was born, was given the middle name Frankie in memory of his mother.

At a pre-inquest review hearing this 
week, barrister Neil Sheldon, representing the family, said Mrs Cappuccini's death may have been avoided if her birth plan had been followed at 
Tunbridge Wells Hospital in Pembury, Kent.

Mr
 Sheldon told West Kent Coroner's Court that Frances - known as Frankie - and
 her husband Tom, 33, had elected for her to have a Caesarean section, 
but the couple were 'reluctantly' persuaded to discard their birth plan 
to allow labour to progress spontaneously overnight.

Mrs Cappuccini eventually needed an emergency Caesarean and suffered heavy bleeding afterwards. 

Although she found the strength to 
spend a few hours nursing her son, Jack, she died of a cardiac arrest soon after.

Her husband is now bringing up Jack and the couple's other son Luca, four.

Mrs Cappuccini, who was affectionately called 'Mrs Coffee' by her pupils, was a Year One teacher at Offham Primary School, near West Malling, Kent.

At
 the time of the tragedy, staff were said to be 'shell shocked' and 
decided to close the small 200-pupil village school for a day to help 
children come to terms with her death.

Mr
 Sheldon said it was 'unlikely' an elective Caesarean carried out on the evening of October 8 would have been complicated.

He added that the family 'deeply regretted' adopting a different course of action to the birth plan and spoke of the profound concern displayed by the family in witness statements given in the days following their tragic loss.

Mr Sheldon said there may be an issue concerning the extent to which parental preference for the mode of delivery could be overridden by obstetric staff at the hospital.

He suggested this could be an issue which would require further investigation.

He said other issues would be 
explored further by him at the full inquest, set for next February, 
including why a blood transfusion was not carried out sooner on Mrs Cappuccini.

Mr
 Sheldon said liability had already been admitted by the Maidstone and 
Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust and there would be a civil claim for damages.

The inquest into Mrs Cappuccini's death will take place in February

A statement released by solicitor Kate Rohde read: 'The Cappuccini family are relieved that the inquisitorial process has begun because it will give them the opportunity to understand how and why.

The inquest is set to take place between February 24-28 next year.

After Mrs Cappuccini's death last year, her school's headteacher Phillip Hunter said: 'Frankie did her teacher training with us nine years ago and stayed on afterwards.

'She was a bubbly, enthusiastic and positive person and on top of all a brilliant teacher. She was a friend and a colleague to us.'

A book of condolence was opened at nearby St Michael's Church and tearful villagers left flowers and personal messages.

Shortly after her death, Paula Botha, whose son Troy was taught by Frankie, said: 'It is such a tragedy for this to happen, and to such a wonderful person just makes it feel so much more of a tragedy.

'She was an amazing teacher and an amazing individual and we are all going to miss her very much - her family, the school children, fellow teachers, parents and friends.

One friend and former work colleague said: 'She was the most wonderful person and teacher - beautiful inside and out.'
