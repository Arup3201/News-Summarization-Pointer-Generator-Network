Bulldozers are clearing away rubble from buildings razed to the ground by Israeli airstrikes near Damascus, as Syria pledges retaliation for the 'declaration of war'.

Pictures have emerged from Syria showing the damage caused to buildings, including some forming part of a chicken farm, by an attack in Al-Hama - close to Jamraya where a research centre was targeted.

Senior government ministers in Syria warned its neighbour it risked engulfing the Middle East in conflict after carrying out airstrikes twice in the past three days.

Faisal al Mekdad, Syria's deputy foreign minister, pledged that the country would retaliate against Israel 'in its own time and way' after a weapons factory and other military facilities were bombed.

Israel claimed it was targeting Iranian weapons bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. But Syrian officials accused Israel of carrying out 'terrorist acts' on behalf of jihadi groups trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.

Israel's second raid on Syria in 48 hours signalled a massive escalation of its involvement in the two-year civil war. Video footage showed dramatic orange-flamed blasts over Damascus's skyline after weapons dumps were hit in the raids, which also killed several people.

Eyewitness Mohammed Saeed said: 'The explosions were so strong the earth shook under us.'

Syria
 said three military sites had been hit: the research centre at Jamraya;
 a paragliding airport in the al-Dimas area of Damascus, and a site in 
Maysaloun.

A statement from
 the Syrian Foreign Ministry said: 'The Israeli attack led to the fall 
of a number of martyrs and wounded from the ranks of Syrian citizens, 
and led to widespread destruction in these sites and in the civilian 
districts near to them.

'This
 leaves no room for doubt Israel is the beneficiary, the mover and 
sometime the executor of the terrorist acts which Syria is witnessing 
and which target it as a state and people directly or through its tools 
inside.'

Syrian 
information minister Omran al-Zohbi warned the attack made the Middle 
East 'more dangerous' and 'opens the door wide to all possibilities'.

He added that Syria had the duty 'to defend its people by all available means'.

Israel's main target in the latest raid was believed to be stores of Conqueror missiles in transit from 
Syria's ally, Iran, to Hezbollah militants in Lebanon.

On Friday, Israeli aircraft also hit a
 shipment of missiles near the Lebanon border, according to US and 
Israeli officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has 
repeatedly warned it would take military action to prevent such weapons 
from reaching Hezbollah, which fought a month long war with Israel in 
2006.

The Syrian regime was yesterday accused of massacring Sunni families in a campaign of 'sectarian cleansing'.

Horrific images emerged of more than 100 bodies found in the town of Banias and nearby village of Bayda, which are in the heartlands of President Bashar al-Assad's rival Shia sect.

A baby and a young girl were piled among a dozen members of one family, while other pictures show the mutilated and burned bodies of Sunnis.

The US State Department reported that pro-government forces destroyed Bayda with mortars then executed surviving families.

Local opposition groups accused the government of launching a campaign of sectarian cleansing.

The Syrian Observatory For Human Rights said about 4,000 Sunnis had fled Banias amid fears of further massacres.

The Syrian government claimed that  it had fought 'terrorist groups' and restored security to the area.

Uzi Rubin, a missile expert and 
former Israeli defence ministry official, said: 'If fired from southern 
Lebanon [the Conqueror missiles] can reach Tel Aviv. It is a game 
changer because they are a threat to Israel's infrastructure and 
military installations.'

Israel previously targeted the 
Jamraya research centre in January. Western officials have suggested 
that it is involved in chemical weapons research.

The air strikes come as the US is 
considering whether to launch military action against the Syrian regime 
after reports it had used chemical weapons against rebels.

Israeli officials say
 the targets are shipments of highly accurate, Iranian-made guided 
missiles known as
 Fateh-110s, but Syria's foreign ministry said the attacks show 
co-ordination with 'terrorists' including al-Qaeda linked militants.

The strikes had led to a number of casualties and widespread damage, it was reported in a letter sent to the UN.

'The
 flagrant Israeli attack on armed forces sites in Syria underlines the 
co-ordination between 'Israel', terrorist groups and... the al-Nusra 
Front," the statement said, referring to al-Qaeda militants fighting 
with the rebels.'

Fateh-110 missiles which carry a 
half-ton warhead is a short-range ballistic missile developed by Iran 
and first put into service in 2002.

The
 Islamic Republic unveiled an upgraded version last year that improved 
the weapon's accuracy and increased its range to 300 kilometers (185 
miles).

On Friday Israeli aircraft hit a shipment of  the missiles in Syria, according to unnamed US and Israeli officials.

Video
 footage uploaded onto the Internet showed a series of explosions. One 
lit up the skyline over the city, while another sent up a tower of 
flames and secondary blasts.

A Western intelligence source told Reuters the operation hit Iranian-supplied missiles which were en route to Hezbollah.

'In
 last night's attack, as in the previous one, what was attacked were 
stores of Fateh-110 missiles that were in transit from Iran to 
Hezbollah,' the source said.

The
 British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the scale of the
 attack meant it was beyond the military capability of Syrian rebels, 
and quoted eyewitnesses in the area as saying they saw jets in the sky 
at the time of the blasts.

Syrian television said: 'The new 
Israeli attack is an attempt to raise the morale of the terrorist groups
 which have been reeling from strikes by our noble army.'

The U.S. State Department had no immediate comment and the Israeli Embassy in Washington declined comment.

If confirmed, Sunday's attack would 
be Israel's third strike inside Syria since late January, but there was 
no immediate comment from Israeli officials.

'We don't respond to this kind of report,' said an Israeli military spokeswoman.

The
 Observatory said the blasts hit Jamraya as well as a nearby ammunition 
depot. Other activists said a missile brigade and two Republican Guard 
battalions may also have been targeted in the heavily militarised area 
just north of Damascus.

Damascus-based journalist Alaa 
Ebrahim told the BBC that one of the blasts was 'the biggest explosion' 
the city had seen since the conflict began two years ago.

He
 said residents living near Jamraya reported feeling a 'mild 
earthquake'  just before the blast, indicating that the rockets may have
 hit an underground facility.

At least 70,000 people have been killed in the bloody civil war between President Bashar Assad's regime forces and rebels.

The latest airstrikes come after  reports of 'sectarian 'massacres  near the coastal region of central Syria.

Activists said that more than 100 people, including women and children, were killed in the Sunni village of al-Bayda and the nearby coastal town of Baniyas.

The Israeli strikes follow days of renewed concerns that Syria might be using chemical weapons against opposition forces. U.S. President Barack Obama has characterized evidence of the use of chemical weapons as a 'game-changer' that would have 'enormous consequences.'
