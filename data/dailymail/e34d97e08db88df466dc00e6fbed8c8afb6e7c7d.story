Bullying and campaigns of abuse were ‘endemic’ in a secretive police union which ‘cynically exploited’ the Plebgate scandal, a damning report reveals today.

Hardline members of the Police Federation ‘disgracefully’ hounded senior officers, threatened dissenting staff with the sack and used ‘guerrilla’ tactics to halt government plans to shake-up pay and conditions, it says.

Federation chairmen and politicians - including Home Secretary Theresa May - routinely suffered ‘personalised’ attacks from militant officials determined to scupper sweeping reforms.

Important business was discussed ‘aggressively, in public, at 10 o’clock at night after a considerable amount of alcohol had been consumed’, a whistleblower told the Home Affairs Select Committee.

The cross-party panel of MPs also criticises the Federation for ‘unnecessarily’ stashing £70million of members’ money - including some in hidden so-called ‘No.2 accounts’ held by local branches - and hand back £120 each police officers.

And the committee warns if the notorious organisation - effectively a union - fails to reform, it would be ‘derelict’ of the Government not to introduce tough new laws.

Police Minister Damian Green has already fired a shot across the bows of the organisation - representing 125,000 rank-and-file officers - by ordering it to act ‘in the interests both of the police and the public’ to avoid legislation.

The scathing report comes ahead of the Federation’s annual conference in Bournemouth next week.

Members will vote on a package of reforms recommended in an independent review by ex-Home Office mandarin Sir David Normington.

The Federation is still reeling from the fallout from Plebgate which led to the resignation of Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell, its political campaigning and the Mail’s revelations about ‘extravagant’ credit card spending and off-shore accounts.

A survey of rank-and-file officers found almost 75 per cent thought the Federation did a ‘poor job’ speaking up for members and 91 per cent said it ‘should change’.

The 23-page report said the Federation had treated successive national chairmen - including outgoing Steve Williams and Paul McKeever, who died last year - ‘quite disgracefully’.

They endured ‘persistent attempts to undermine and destabilise... by bullying and personal attacks’.

In a letter written to the Federation’s 30-strong top committee, Mr Williams wrote that he had ‘continually been criticised, ridiculed and verbally ridiculed... and my integrity questioned’ over his stance on the Normington Review.

He added: ‘Whilst accepting emotions are running high in the advent of inevitable change, at times I have genuinely felt that I have been gratuitously and cruelly bullied and humiliated.’

The report said chairmen trying to implement reforms became ‘enmired in interminable, internecine power-struggles which would not have been out of place in a medieval court.’

MPs also attacked the Federation’s decision to appoint a controversial public relations firm run by former radio ‘shock jock’ Jon Gaunt - the son of a policeman- as a ‘serious error of judgment’.

The organisation secretly paid £10,000-a-month for advice on using ‘guerrilla tactics’ against the Government weeks before the Plebgate scandal.

The hostile media strategy called for a military-style ‘blitzkrieg’ to halt radical change.

In September 2012, then chief whip Mr Mitchell and a policeman clashed at the gates of Downing Street. Mr Mitchell was accused of calling police officers ‘f****** plebs’ - something he has always vehemently denied.

He has insisted the row was hijacked by Federation officials for political ends.

Keith Vaz, the committee's Labour chairman, said: 'We were shocked by the scale of bullying that we found at the Federation's headquarters'

Earlier this month, Mr Gaunt admitted he saw the Plebgate affair as an ‘absolutely fantastic’ opportunity to promote the police agenda.

But the strategy backfired because three officers who called for Mr Mitchell’s resignation following the incident have been sacked and a fourth, PC Keith Wallis, 53, was jailed for misconduct after admitting lying about witnessing the row.

Branding the contract with Mr Gaunt ‘inappropriate’, the committee said he had ‘damaged, rather than enhance’ the organisation’s reputation.

It said: ‘Mr Gaunt cynically sought to exploit the Plebgate incident as part of a manipulative media strategy which included what he described as “blitzkrieg” and “guerrilla” tactics.

This entire episode does the Federation no credit at all.’ The report follows a string of revelations by the Mail on accusations of bullying and lavish spending by the Federation.

Concerns were raised over significant amounts of money put through on corporate Mastercard credit cards, with some four-figure bills believed to have come after a conference organised by the Scottish Police Federation last November.

Officials were also accused of bullying at the Federation’s plush £26million headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey, which was built in 2007 and boasts a 55-room hotel with a bar, swimming pool and 11 two-bedroom grace-and-favour apartments.

Keith Vaz, the committee’s Labour chairman, said: ‘We were shocked by the scale of bullying that we found at the Federation’s headquarters. It rivals any popular soap opera.

‘It is disgraceful that any chairman should have been hounded out for championing long-overdue reforms.’

He added: ‘Our police service is the best in the world but its reputation has been extensively damaged by the federation suffering a sustained period of self-inflicted harm.’
