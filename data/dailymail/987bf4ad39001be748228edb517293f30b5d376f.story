A 14-year-old western Pennsylvania boy has been charged with desecrating a statue of Jesus by standing in front of it and mimicking a sex act, and then posting pictures of it on the Internet.

Bedford County officials say the court papers against the boy are sealed, because they're filed in juvenile court.

The Altoona Mirror reported authorities charged the boy through a 1972 law, which makes it a crime to desecrate a venerated object.

Charged: A boy has been charged with desecrating a statue of Jesus by standing in front of it and mimicking a sex act. He later posted a photo of the incident to Facebook 

'On or about 07/20/14 the ACCUSED took and posted pictures of himself on Facebook desecrating a statue of Jesus,' a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun said.

A second photo of the boy with the Jesus statue shows him raising his hands to the sky while standing on the statue's hands. That photo was published by The Bedford County Free Press.

A college student was prosecuted under the same 1972 law when he urinated on a nativity scene in Wilkes-Barre in January 2010.

The statue at issue in the new case belongs to Love in the Name of Christ, a Christian service organization with a branch in Everett.

Bev Patten, a spokesperson for the organization, told MailOnline that Love in the Name of Christ did not press charges in the incident.

'Our request was for prayer for the young man,' Patten said. 

Trpr. Jeffrey Petucci, a Pennsylvania State Police spokesman, told MailOnline the district attorney's office discovered the photo and forwarded it to state police in Bedford.

Based on the police investigation, the district attorney's office filed charges, he said.

Petucci said the boy did not tell investigators why he desecrated the statue.

Scene: A statue at the Everett branch of Love in the Name of Christ was desecrated in July
