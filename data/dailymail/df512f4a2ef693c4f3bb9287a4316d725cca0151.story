More than two decades ago, a 10-year-old schoolgirl threw a bottle into the sea off the coast of Hull as she embarked on a family holiday, hoping to get a response from a stranger in a faraway land.

Inside the bottle was a scrawled letter from Zoe Lemon, a youngster with a love of "ballet, playing the flute and the piano", who had just boarded a ferry bound for a holiday in Germany.

She told her prospective recipients of her pet hamster and fish, both called Sparkle, and her parents who were both teachers.

Miss Lemon, of Salford, Greater Manchester, soon forgot about her act of whimsy, eventually marrying and having a child herself.

But this Christmas she was staggered to receive a reply after 23 years.

The bottle was discovered more than 350 miles away in the Netherlands by a man walking his dog, who wrote back.

The mother – whose surname is now Averianov – was amazed when her parents called for Christmas and said they had post from Europe.

It turned out to be a reply to her letter from Piet and Jacqueline Lateur from near Rotterdam.

Mr Lateur was walking his dog in the Oosterschelde dykes, near where he and his wife live in Serooskerke, when he found the bottle with Zoe’s letter inside.

Mrs Averianov, 33, who works in a jewellery shop, said: 'It’s been a bit crazy really. My parents came to visit on Christmas day and they had this letter from Europe addressed to my maiden name, Lemon.

'The first thing I saw was my handwriting as a child and my little letter  saying who I was and about my pets and my hobbies. It made me a bit emotional.'

Since receiving the letter, Mrs Averianov has been in contact with Mr Lateur via email and asked to see photographs of where the bottle was found.

He told her: 'I am keeping your little letter on my piano. I know you are no longer a little girl but you asked me to write you so I have.'

Odyssey: The bottle's 23-year-long journey finally reached its end in Holland, 350 miles away

Mrs Averianov, who lived in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, when she was growing up, said: 'It’s amazing it was still undamaged. My dad has been looking at pictures of the area where it was found online and it looks as though there is a cove, so it could have been bobbing around there for years.

'My dad is ridiculously excited. I think he’ll be after visiting, but we have only been in contact a few days so only time will tell.'

Mrs Averianov’s father, John Lemon, 68, had encouraged his daughter to throw the message into the sea on a family holiday and now she is considering doing the same for her five-year-old son Maksim.

She said: 'I’ll probably wait until he’s a bit older and can understand and write a letter, but maybe we’ll do it by attaching it to a balloon.'

The envelope, visible through the bottle, shows Earl Willard's address and where the letter was sent from

The oldest message in a bottle washed up on a beach after 107 years and a 1,115 mile odyssey.

The green glass artefact (above) was spotted sitting on the shore of the secluded Schooner's Cove in Tofino, Canada.

The note inside is signed by Earl Willard, who was 76 hours into a boat trip from San Francisco to Bellingham, Washington, when he 'posted' his note.

The finder, Steve Thurber, caused outrage when he refused to open it and read the message inside, although he claims he is trying to preserve the contents.

The previous Guinness World Record for a message in a bottle was 98 years after Scottish fisherman Andrew Leaper found a bottle in Shetland last year.

The bottle in Scotland contained a postcard offering a reward of sixpence to the finder.

A message in a bottle sent out to sea by a schoolgirl holidaying in Cornwall has washed up in Norway nearly 20 years later.

Coventry resident Lucy Elliot, now 31, was just 12-years-old when she wrote the note in 1994 but she never expected to get a reply.

Incredibly, the hand-written message was found recently by Kurt Johnny Haaland and his wife hundreds of miles away across the North Sea in Scandinavia.

A message in a bottle written 54 years ago was discovered In an Arctic valley and may also include the last written words of a scientist who suffered a massive stroke at age 25.

The note was found under a rock cairn on Canada's Ward Hunt Island. It was written by geologist Paul T. Walker on July 10, 1959 and was discovered only last month.
