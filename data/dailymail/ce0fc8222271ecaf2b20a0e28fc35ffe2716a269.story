An epilepsy sufferer who continued driving despite his condition killed a passenger after he had a seizure at the wheel.

Peter Murdoch was diagnosed with epilepsy around 30 years ago but never told the DVLA.

He was driving with his wife and two friends when he failed to stop at a junction onto the A592 in Bowness, Cumbria, narrowly missed two cyclists and ploughed into a wall in June last year.

Passenger Elizabeth Thompson, 68, from Marlow, Buckinghamshire, died instantly of multiple injuries, an inquest heard.

Tragedy: Passenger Elizabeth Thompson died in the crash after her friend Peter Murdoch had an epileptic seizure at the wheel

She and husband Garth had been visiting friends Peter and Dorothy, of Main Street, Staveley, Cumbria.

The couple did not know about Mr Murdoch's epilepsy.

The inquest heard the four were travelling along Glebe Road, Bowness when they approached the 'give way' junction leading onto the A592 on 10 June last year.

But Mr Murdoch failed to stop or turn and instead carried straight on, narrowly missing two cyclists before hitting a wall straight ahead.

Garth Thompson told the inquest that he had noticed a change in his friend's behaviour prior to the crash.

He said: 'I was aware that he had 
become somewhat non-responsive. He accelerated and was driving faster 
than you would normally think appropriate but then slowed down and all 
seemed to be well again. Then he accelerated inappropriately when he 
came up to the junction.'

In reference to his epilepsy, Mr Murdoch told the court: 'I obviously should have contacted the DVLA but I do not remember 
anyone ever mentioning it.'

Mrs Murdoch told the inquest at South Lakeland Magistrates Court: 'The epilepsy goes back to the 1980s, and was dealt with by medication, after which his seizures were rare.'

She mentioned an occasion where he was playing squash and blacked out, leading to an overnight stay in hospital.

PC Craig Irving, a collision investigator for Cumbria Police, said all the evidence pointed to Mr Murdoch having some sort of seizure before the tragedy.

A spokesman for Cumbria Police said that after discussion with the CPS and medical experts a decision taken not to prosecute Mr Murdoch.

'We have written to the family of the victim to explain our decision and offer our condolences.'

Ian Smith, South and East Cumbria 
coroner, said the accident highlights the potential danger of taking to 
the wheel after being diagnosed with conditions such as epilepsy.

He recorded a verdict of accidental death and said he would be writing to the DVLA and Department of Transport.

'I will write about the apparent lack of importance put on notifying the DVLA about medical conditions,' he said.

'I think doctors ought to take an 
active stance in relation to anyone who may have a problem and should 
also be required to notify the DVLA.'

Explaining the decision not to 
prosecute Mr Murdoch, a CPS spokesperson said: 'There was clear medical 
evidence that the suspect suffered an epileptic seizure and was not in 
control of the vehicle at the time of the crash. Automatism is a defence
to the charges of causing death by dangerous driving, dangerous 
driving, causing death by careless driving and careless driving. As 
such, we concluded that none of these charges could be brought.

'The defence of automatism would not 
apply if the suspect had driven with the knowledge that there was a real
risk of a seizure, but blood tests confirmed that he had been taking 
his medication as appropriate, so he was fit to drive, and there is 
often no indication in advance that a seizure will take place. It could 
not be proved that the suspect had willingly driven dangerously.

'We also considered whether the 
suspect should be charged for failing to notify the DVLA about his 
condition, which is punishable by up to a £1,000 fine. There was 
sufficient evidence to prove this offence but we concluded that it would
not be in the public interest to proceed as this offence will not be 
repeated (the suspect’s licence was revoked), the driver was unaware of 
the need to notify the DVLA and the victim’s family did not support a 
prosecution.
