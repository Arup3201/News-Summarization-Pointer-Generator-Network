Alexis Sanchez has revealed he is loving life in England with Arsenal ahead of playing for Chile against Brazil at his club's home on Sunday.

The two South American nations come together at the Emirates Stadium in an international friendly, and Sanchez is delighted to be playing in the country he calls home after his £35million move from Barcelona last summer.

And having made a lightning-quick start to his Barclays Premier League career, Sanchez feels he is now well adapted to the ways of the English top flight.

'I'm well adapted to the country and the league now. I must keep on learning, though,' he said.

'I want to expand my knowledge of English football in general, and Arsenal and my team-mates in particular.

'But overall I love this league. At the end of the day, football was invented in this country, right? I live where football was invented. That makes me really happy.'
