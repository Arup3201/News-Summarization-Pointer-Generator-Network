A strange morphing ‘skin’, which looks like it may be alive, could one day be adorning the surface of cars to make them go faster.

The Smorph material, developed by scientists in Massachusetts, uses the same technique that makes golf balls cut through the air faster and straighter.

At low speeds, a golf ball’s dimpled surface reduces its aerodynamic drag in half. However, at higher speeds, the effect reverses.

The ability to change the surface of the Smorph skin in real time comes from the use of a multilayer material with a stiff skin and a soft interior

This has meant that high-speed vehicles haven’t been able to use this trick to their advantage, but now a team of MIT researchers believes they have a solution.

They have created Smart Morphable Surface, or Smorph - a material with a two-layer skin that changes its shape in real-time. 

The inner layer is flexible silicon, wrapped in a stiff outer layer. When a vacuum sucks the air out of the hollow surface, the movement of the flexible and rigid layers creates dimples in the skin.

While a ball with a dimpled surface has half the drag of a smooth one at lower speeds, at higher speeds that advantage reverses. MIT created the 'smorph' material to take advantage of this behaviour (pictured)

The ability to change the surface in real time comes from the use of a multilayer material with a stiff skin and a soft interior.

This is the affect that causes smooth plums to dry into wrinkly prunes. 

To mimic that process, MIT made a hollow ball of soft material with a stiff skin, then extracted air from the hollow interior to make the ball shrink and its surface wrinkle.

At a certain degree of shrinkage, the surface can produce a dimpled pattern that’s very similar to that of a golf ball - and with the same aerodynamic properties.

The aerodynamic properties of dimpled balls can be a bit counterintuitive: You might expect that a ball with a smooth surface would sail through the air more easily.

The reason for the opposite result has to do with the nature of a small layer of the air next to the surface of the ball. 

The irregular surface, it turns out, holds the airflow close to the ball’s surface longer, delaying the separation of the boundary layer.

This reduces the size of the wake - the zone of turbulence behind the ball - which is the main cause of drag for blunt objects. 

'Numerous studies of wrinkling have been done on flat surfaces,' says Pedro Reis, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and civil and environmental engineering.

'Less is known about what happens when you curve the surface. How does that affect the whole wrinkling process?'

The answer, it turns out, is that at a certain degree of shrinkage, the surface can produce a pattern that’s very similar to that of a golf ball - and with the same aerodynamic properties.

The irregular surface holds the airflow close to the ball’s surface longer.

This reduces the size of the wake - the zone of turbulence behind the ball - which is the primary cause of drag for blunt objects.

Because the surface texture can be controlled by adjusting the balls’ interior pressure, the degree of drag reduction can be controlled at will.

'We can generate that surface topography, or erase it,' Professor Reis says. 'That reversibility is why this is pretty interesting; you can switch the drag-reducing effect on and off, and tune it.'

The football being used at this year’s World Cup, for example, uses a similar effect; so do some track suits worn by competitive runners.

But in other uses, the ability to alter a surface could prove useful: For example, many radar antennas are housed in spherical domes, which can collapse catastrophically in very high winds.

A dome that could alter its surface to reduce drag when strong winds are expected might avert such failures, Professor Reis suggests.

The technology could one day be used on the surface of high-speed vehicles, such as this Hennessey Venom GT Spyder. Researchers believe it will help reduce a vehicle's drag

Another application could be the exterior of cars, where the ability to adjust the texture of panels to minimise drag at different speeds could increase fuel efficiency, he says.

John Rogers, a professor of materials research and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who was not involved in this work, says, 'It represents a delightful example of how controlled processes of mechanical buckling can be used to create three-dimensional structures with interesting aerodynamic properties.

The type of dynamic tuning of sophisticated surface morphologies made possible by this approach would be difficult or impossible to achieve in any other way.'
