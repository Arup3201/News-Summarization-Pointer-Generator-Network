A rescue kitten will undergo a life-threatening recovery surgery today after it underwent a routine microchip surgery last week that left him paralyzed.

Muffin, who was just six-weeks-old when Loren Slama rescued him, was taken to Downey Animal Shelter after being found wandering the streets of Los Angeles last week.

After taking Muffin home from the shelter for routine medical microchip implantation, Slama made the horrifying realization that something went very wrong.

Suffering: Muffin is just six-weeks-old and left paralyzed after a botched routine surgery last week 

Hope: Thanks to funding from generous donors, Muffin has enough money to undergo a life-threatening surgery today to remove the chip that left her paralyzed and dragging her tiny body across the floor

The chip: The microchip, an implant used to help identify pets, was meant to go just below the surface of the skin but ended up being lodged in her spine 

Microchips are  are radio-frequency identification (RFID) implants that provide permanent ID for a pet, reports Petfinder.com.

They are meant to be implanted just below the surface of the skin and are not normally painful or invasive. 

They give each pet a personal identification number and even medical histry in the case that the pet is lost. 

Chip implantation is often a required surgery for rescue pets and usually have little to no complications.

Slama said that as soon as she took Muffin home, his adorable little face started to dangle then crash towards the floor all together. She decided to get to the bottom of what was ailing her new pet after leaving the vet.

An X-ray showed that a microchip that doctors implanted as part of the routine process had gotten lodged into the kitten's spine., reportsCBS. 

Now the six-week-old Muffin has to drag its entire left side when it moves.

Loved: Loren Slama rescued six-week-old Muffin from the harsh streets of Los Angeles last week and wants her to be healthy and happy in her caring home 

Immobilized: Muffin can barely move and when she does, she must drag the left side of her body on the floor

Horrified: Owner Loren Slama says that thanks to generous donors, Muffin might have a chance at recovery after a life-threatening surgery today to remove the chip 

X-ray: X-rays show that the chip went right through Muffin's spinal cord causing debilitating paralysis

'I noticed after 30 minutes his head started to dangle and it started to kind of crash. On the X-ray it was clearly demonstrated that the microchip was inserted all the way into the spine. That’s why he was paralyzed,' Slama said.

'I was in a total state of shock,' Slama added.

Muffin has a surgery scheduled for Today at the Angels Veterinary Specialty Center where a neurologist will attempt to remove the chip.

The surgery is very risky and Muffin might die during  or shortly after but Slama has no choice if she wants Muffin to have a chance at surviving free of pain.

Slama asked Downey Animal Control to pay for the surgery since it was their doctor who implanted a microchip but they declined.

'It’s a highly risky procedure. He might die during the surgery and even a few days after the surgery.

However, we need to do the surgery because the longer the microchip stays into the spine the more damage it can cause,' Slama said.

Catastrophe: Muffin was left paralyzed but if he survives today's surgery he may have a change at a normal life

The proof: Animal Control is investigating what may have went wrong during the surgery that left a poor kitten paralyzed with a microchip implanted in his spine 

Hopeful: Today's surgery to remove the chip could help Muffin lead a more normal life after becoming paralyzed

The Los Angeles Department of Animal Control and Care released a statement about their reasoning for not funding the surgery.

'This was an anomaly. We acted in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines in terms of whether the kitten should be micro chipped for its age and size.

'We have never had an incident like this before. However, we are conducting an investigation and determining whether or not any corrections need to be made,' they said.

Despite Los Angeles Animal Control's lack of funding, Slama was able to raise money through caring donors on Youcaring.com.

They reached over their $5,000 goal.

'Dear Supporters and Animal Lovers,

WE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL!!!!! We have left the fund raiser open, since once it is closed, we will be unable to update all of Muffin's friends. NO NEED TO DONATE MORE! We are overwhelmed by your generosity. Because of you, Muffin will get the finest care with the best surgical team. Please keep Muffin in your thoughts and prayers that he survives the surgery, and lives a long, healthy kitty life. THANK YOU from the bottom of every rescuer's heart,' says the site.

Loren Slama promises to keep supporters updated on Muffin's recovery.
