A West Highland terrier became stuck on a roof because he wanted to get closer to seagulls - and had to be brought back to ground by firefighters.

Whisky the Westie climbed up to a height of 20ft and then refused to budge. The one year-old West Highland Terrier climbed out of a bedroom window when he heard screeching birds flying above the house.

But when Whisky looked down to the ground, he froze in terror and no amount of calling and encouraging from his owners Jenny and Richard Eacott would shift him.

One-year-old Whisky's owners only discovered he was missing when they heard their other dog, Jazz, barking in the back garden and staring up at the roof. They then found him trapped on the top of the roof - after apparently climbing out of their bedroom window

No amount of calling could bring Whisky down from the roof and the family soon had to call firefighters to bring him back to ground. Here the westie is pictured with the firefighters and his owner eight-year-old Jonathan Eacott

The family were finally left with no option but to call firefighters to get the little dog down from the roof of the bungalow in Felixstowe, Suffolk.

Mrs Eacott said: 'We didn’t know anything was wrong until we heard Whisky’s sister Jazz barking outside in the back garden looking up at the roof, probably shouting ‘What are you doing up there?’

'We tried calling him, even dangling ham to him, but he wouldn’t come. The fire crew put up a ladder and being a sociable little dog he came to them and they brought him down.'

The mother-of-two added: 'They were amazing and we just want to thank them so much.

'I know they are part-time on-call firefighters and their kindness was appreciated so much.'
