A police investigation has been launched following the death of an eight-month-old baby who fell off a bed.

Le'veah Stacey Herbert was found lying on top of a plastic bag on the floor of her home in Gorton, Manchester.

Her death is being treated as a tragic accident after a post mortem examination ruled out asphyxiation as the cause.

It is understood her mother Shannon has not returned to the rented property since the incident on July 6.

Neighbours have spoken of their shock and described Le'veah as a 'lovely baby'.

Claire Evans, 29, said: 'I saw the ambulance arriving. It's just tragic. She was a very friendly, smiley and happy baby.

'She was always well turned out by her mum. She seemed a nice girl. I used to see them walking past my house.'

In tributes on social networking sites, one friend said: 'Precious angel gone to soon sleep tight beautiful.'

Another said: 'Rip gorgeous, gone far to soon.'

It is understood her mother had entered her into an online 2014 Cutest Baby contest.

Police and paramedics were called to a terrace house at around 1.50pm after frantic 999 calls reporting that the baby girl wasn’t breathing.

Paramedics found she had gone into cardiac arrest and the girl was rushed to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where she was later pronounced dead.

Detectives will investigate the incident but confirmed that the death is not being treated as suspicious.

They have also said that no arrests have been made.

Details have been handed over to a coroner who has opened and adjourned an inquest, which is rescheduled for September 26.

A police spokesman said: ‘Emergency services were called to an address on Acheson Street to reports a baby had stopped breathing.

‘Paramedics and officers attended to find an eight month old baby girl who had gone into cardiac arrest. She was taken to hospital where she sadly died.

‘There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death and the file has been passed to the coroner.’
