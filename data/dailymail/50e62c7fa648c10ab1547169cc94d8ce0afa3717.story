The worried daughter of missing radio personality Casey Kasem has vowed to do whatever it takes to get her father back, and is praying he's safe, wherever he is.

Kerri Kasem, the 82-year-old's middle daughter, said Monday that she and her sister, Julie, had a 'wonderful' visit with their dad last Tuesday, just days before he was secretly moved from his out of a Santa Monica nursing home.

She claims her estranged stepmom, Jean Kasem - Casey's current wife - is responsible for the disappearance, and that the woman moved him in the middle of the night without a court order or doctor's discharge.

'I will do whatever I need to do to get my dad back!' Kerri, 35, told Closer. 'I'm praying that he is somewhere safe. I'm praying to God that he’s being cared for and that he's not getting sicker and sicker by the day.'

As of Tuesday afternoon, the 'American Top 40' host is labeled a missing person following the court's decision to grant Kerri conservatorship of her father's health.

Kerri's May 6 visit was the first time she'd seen him in five months, after an attorney helped secure them access to his room.

'They let me and my sister in to see him and it was a wonderful visit,' Kerri said. 'My dad said, "I love you."

'Dad was animated. He was smiling. He moved his arms a little bit. He knew we were there,' she added to Closer.

'When we went to leave, we said, "Dad, we'll be back soon. We'll be back soon." That's when he looked up at us and was able to say the word, "When?" We said, "Dad, as soon as we can,"' she said.

Speaking of Jean, one of Kerri's attorneys, Martha Patterson, told Closer she has no authority as a healthcare agent or Casey's wife to move him out of the facility without permission from a doctor.

'I cannot imagine someone in his condition being carried out without proper medical equipment,' she said.

Kerri added tearfully that she's 'filled with an extreme amount of worry' for her father.

Daughter Kerri Kasem had sought a temporary conservator-ship and was appointed her father's temporary caretaker on Monday

Family: Radio Personality Casey Kasem, is seen with wife Jean Kasem, daughter Kerri Kasem, son Michael Kasem and daughter Julie Kasem on January 25, 1985. The children are from another marriage

The daughter's words come after a judge ordered an investigation into the whereabouts of the comedian after an attorney for the ailing man's wife said he had been removed from the country.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy ordered a court investigator and adult protective services to find out where Casey Kasem is being treated and report back to the court.

The elderly radio personality suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, can no longer speak and has been in various medical facilities chosen by his Jean Kasem.

Casey Kasem's children had earlier complained they had been unable to see their father in accordance with an agreement with their stepmother.

Kerri had sought a temporary conservator-ship and was appointed her father's temporary caretaker on Monday. 

Her attorney, Troy Martin, said the family believes the entertainer has been taken to an Indian reservation in Washington state.

Murphy's order came after Craig Marcus, an attorney who appeared on Jean Kasem's behalf at Monday's hearing, said he did not know where the radio personality was but knew that he had been removed from the country.

'I have no idea where he is,' Marcus said.

The
 revelation brought stunned protests from Murphy and two of Casey 
Kasem's daughters, two of the entertainer's three children from a 
previous marriage.

'Your statements concern me even more,' the judge told Marcus, who declined to comment after the hearing.

Marcus said in court that Jean Kasem had every right to move her husband as she saw fit.

Murphy appointed a doctor to look into Casey Kasem's care and ordered a court-appointed attorney to find out his whereabouts as soon as possible.

Casey Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and Casey's Top 40, and was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby Doo.

As temporary conservator, Kerri Kasem will have access to her father's medical records and other reports that have previously been sealed by court order.

Kerri Kasem's case is the second one opened by one of the former host's children to try to gain access to their father and have some oversight over his care.

A previous case by daughter Julie Kasem was dismissed after she reached a settlement with her stepmother, but the daughter said on Monday that agreement has been breached.

In a court filing last week, Kerri Kasem's attorneys wrote that the entertainer has been repeatedly moved without warning and his children have been unable to see him. The complaint accused Jean Kasem of elder abuse by isolating her husband from his family.

'We've been troubled for a long time,' Kerri Kasem said after Monday's court hearing. She said Murphy's orders will ensure that the truth about her father's care comes out.

'Justice has been served today,' she said.
