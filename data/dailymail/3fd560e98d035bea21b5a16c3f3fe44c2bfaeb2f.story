A 'person of interest' has been found in the unsolved murder of a young couple who were tortured and strangled on their way home from a Valentine's dance 42 years ago.

Cold case investigators refuse to name the man that they have pinpointed in the brutal killings of Jesse McBane, 19, and 20-year-old Patricia Mann who were found murdered at a 'lover's lane' in Orange County, North Carolina in 1971.

Dubbed the 'Valentine's Day killings' the bodies were found 13 days after they had left a dance at the hospital in Durham where Miss Mann was training to be a nurse. 

Jesse McBane, 19, and 20-year-old Patricia Mann, were killed in 1971 after attending a Valentine's Day dance. There bodies were found tied up and strangled. No one has ever been charged with their killings

The couple's bodies were found tied to a tree in this secluded woodland in Orange County, North Carolina

The couple were last seen at around 11.30pm leaving the building and heading for the secluded spot.

Orange County sheriff's investigator Dawn Hunter told WRAL: 'They were probably approached by someone who made them get out of the 
car.'

Police believe that the couple, who had planned to get married, were sadistically tortured.  

Investigator Tim Horne Horne told the station: 'Evidence from the autopsy and at the scene tended to indicate that they were strangled over a period of time.

'It wasn’t one continuous pulling tight of a rope around their neck to strangle them to death.

'It appeared to be a situation where the rope was tightened, then they let it go, let them regain their breath, regain consciousness, possibly, and then they were strangled again.'

The young couple were last seen leaving this building which used to be Watts Hospital in Durham, North Carolina following a Valentine's Day dance in 1971

Miss Mann and Mr McBane's bodies were discovered fully clothed and tied up.

They were missing for almost two weeks when a land surveyor spotted their bodies tied to the base of a tree.

An autopsy report revealed that they had tight, knotted ropes around their wrists and necks, with another rope tying their bodies together.

A medical examiner said that the couple had puncture wounds to the chest but those were probably inflicted post-mortem.

The trainee nurse also had a half-inch tear in her liver which may have been caused by being punched in the stomach, according to an autopsy report.

Rumors swirled as the small community came to terms with the shocking deaths with one report that the killer could be a doctor at the local hospital.

It has long been suspected that the person who committed the brutal murders knew the remote area well.

Now police have identified a 'person of interest' in the area, who is still alive. They refused to reveal further details.
