Cheers: One in 20 people say 'nice one', while younger generations are more likely to offer a 'cool' than a thank you

For many a traditionalist, it is the most important two-word phrase in our vocabulary.

But ‘thank you’ is falling by the wayside, replaced increasingly with less formal expressions of gratitude, a poll reveals.

Although the average person will say 'thank you' nearly 5,000 times a year, one in three are more likely to throw in a 'cheers' or 'ta' where it's needed, rather than risk sounding old fashioned.

One in 20 now say 'nice one' instead, while younger generations are more likely to offer a 'cool' than a thank you.

'Merci', 'fab' and even 'gracias' were also listed as common phrases to use, as was 'much appreciated'.

One in twenty who took part in the 
poll of 2,000 people by the Food Network UK for Thank You Day, which is 
marked on November 24 said a formal 'thank you' was now not often needed
in everyday conversation.

Nick Thorogood, managing director of 
Food Network UK, said: 'When it comes to saying 'thank you', people will
always find the way that works best for them and it's interesting to 
see what the act means to different people.

'The fact that over a quarter of us 
choose to say thank you through food highlights that taking the time and
effort to say 'thanks' is still very important to us.'

A massive 95 per cent of respondents 
to the poll claimed manners are important, with eight in ten Britons 
believing their etiquette is spot on.

Having said that, more than one in ten adults said they regularly won't say thank you if they are in a bad mood.

Poor show: Inattentive service is seen as a good reason to remain tight-lipped

But despite being quick to talk up their own politeness, it seems most people are not clear on the bigger picture.

When asked if Britain was a polite country for example, opinion was split down the middle.

Most people claimed that saying thank
you was something drilled into them by their parents, but four in ten 
will utter a thank you purely out of habit.

And while eight in ten people think they
could show more appreciation, a third of respondents barely even 
acknowledge what they're doing when they say thank you.

A huge 70 per cent of those questioned 
will say thank you to a person's face without even meaning it, while a 
fifth avoid saying it when they know they should - on at least two 
occasions every day.

A total of 95 per cent claim manners are important.

Eight in ten 
believe their etiquette is spot on.

A huge 70 per cent of people will say thank you without meaning it.

A quarter of people prefer to express gratitude via social networks.

Another quarter of Britons say thank you with food - with 23 per cent cooking a meal to show their appreciation

Another 15 per cent will bake a cake.

A third will send a handwritten 
thank you note - but 45 per cent admit its been more than six months 
since they sent one.

It seems our friends and family get the brunt of our bad manners with half admitting they're rubbish at thanking those closest to them - many justifying the lack of thanks because their family 'already know I'm grateful.'

When spoken words won't do, it falls to a nice text to do the job for most people.

A thank you email is also popular, while a quarter turn to social networks to express gratitude.

And while people seem happy to say thanks digitally, six out of ten are adamant it's no easier to thank someone by email than in person.

A quarter of Britons say thank you with food, with 23 per cent cooking a meal to show their appreciation to someone. Another 15 per cent bake a cake.

A third will still send a handwritten thank you note - but 45 per cent confess its been more than six months since they bothered to send one.

It follows that 85 per cent of people will be annoyed at not getting the gratitude they feel they deserve.

It emerged that one in three believe people say thank you a lot less now than in previous generations, while most thought the world could do with showing more gratitude.

Anger is the biggest reason for not saying thank you, while poor service is seen as a good reason to remain tight lipped.
