A group of pranksters who had some time on their hands over the summer break managed to pull off an incredible golf hole-in-one under some unusual circumstances.

The Australian foursome who make up Youtube comedy group How Ridiculous were holidaying in Busselton - about three hours south of Perth in Western Australia - when they set up an underwater golf hole.

Performing a spectacular hole-in-one and capturing the whole thing on multiple cameras, the boys shared their incredible feat on their YouTube channel this week.

The stunt saw the four friends set up a golf flag 50 metres of the shore of Busselton beach in Perth

Two other members of the group tread water about 50 metres off shore swimming alongside a weighted bucket with a flag sticking out of the ocean, waiting for their mate to make the incredible hole-in-one.

Scott, who was filming the stunt with a GoPro from the right side of the flag told Daily Mail Australia the boys camp at the same spot every Christmas and after pulling of golf-related stunt at the same beach a few years back they decided to try something new.

'We thought lets do something a little more innovative, and a little more fun,' Scott said.

Taking place on a picture-perfect summer day the impressive feat is met with cheers of delight from the pair in the ocean as on other member runs in to shot to give golfer Brett a high-five.

Although the trick took over 50 attempts to pull of and more than two hours to film, that's simply part of the fun for this close-knit group of friends.

Since 2009 the foursome have been creating similar entertaining videos, which they originally shared with just their family and friends.

'We're all friends in our local church so it's a cool community thing it's shared around for a bit of a laugh,' Scott told Daily Mail Australia.

But since humble beginnings the How Ridiculous gang have claimed their very own Guinness World Record for the highest basketball shot ever made, have over 100,000 subscribers on YouTube and millions of views across all their videos.

The group also work in conjunction with charity Compassion, whose aim is to release children in developing nations from poverty.

'It stems from our faith and we are very community focused and we just got to point where when we realised we had a substantial platform, Scott said. 

'We just thought if views and subscribers and likes is all we're getting that's pretty empty.

'We want to give back and not be totally self-centred.'
