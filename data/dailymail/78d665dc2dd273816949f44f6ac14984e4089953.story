Shocking new footage has captured the careless actions of motorists and pedestrians who are gambling with their lives by ignoring the road rules and warning signs and interfering with the new light rail network.

One of the videos obtained by Daily Mail Australia shows a taxi driver turning at an intersection before slamming on the brakes to avoid colliding with the tram at Broadbeach on the Gold Coast.

In another piece of footage from Tuesday, a man is seen walking beside a tram across a bridge in the suburb of Southport, completely ignoring the 'no walking' signs.

The third filmed footage shows abother taxi driver turning blindly on to the tram tracks without checking to see the approaching tram. The drivers of the car and trams stop just in time.

Transport and Main Roads Minister Scott Emerson said no tram driver should have to be confronted with a situation where they are unable to stop.

Mr Emerson said motorists and pedestrians need to follow the road rules and not take senseless risks such as illegal u-turns, turning on red signals and jaywalking.

'You’re not just breaking the road rules but you’re also placing yourself and tram passengers in a dangerous situation and possibly risking the lives of those on board the tram.

Mr Emerson said it was frightening to watch the taxi driver who failed to see a tram travelling alongside him before turning directly into its path.

'The tram and taxi had to come to a screaming halt to avoid a collision,' he said.

'I shudder to think how the scenario would have played out if the taxi driver realised his mistake a few seconds later.

'I’m appalled to see a man walking along the tram tracks, ignoring 'no walking' signs and putting himself and tram passengers at risk of an accident. It’s not hard to imagine the pedestrian’s actions could have resulted in a fatal hit.

'I cannot stress enough that if the drivers in these clips had made their mistakes a couple of seconds later, the incidents could have resulted in serious injury or death.'

Following the array of dramatic footages, another man can be seen walking onto the light rail tracks, before realising a tram was headed towards him before he sprints through an oncoming traffic.
