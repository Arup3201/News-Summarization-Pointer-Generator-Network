He may be small but five-year-old Florida drum major Taranza McKelvin makes a big impression when he leads his marching band.

All eyes were on the youngster when he led the Glades Central band on to the pitch for the annual high school football Muck Bowl on Saturday.

Despite performing at an event that can attract crowds of up to 25,000, Taranza was unfazed as he confidently strutted his stuff with the band.

Natural talent: The school's band director says Taranza picked up the routines quickly

'That was his debut, and he took it and ran with it,' band director Charles Moorer told the Palm Beach Post.

Taranza said: 'I was nervous when I first got out into the field, but then I just performed. I love performing in front of a lot of people. It’s really exciting.'

The five-year-old only started practicing with the band in September, but was quick to learn the moves.

'What was so amazing was that he would 
catch on to most of the steps and movements quicker than a lot of the 
high school students,' Mr Moorer said.

His natural talent was evident on Saturday, as he danced, marched and strutted while blowing a whistle and wearing a white suit and burgundy cape.

The youngster first became interested in marching bands when he was four, so his parents signed him up for band camp at his local high school, according to Buzz Feed.

'His father mentioned it last year when 
he was 4 and I was very, very hesitant about it due to the big age gap 
between him and the other students,' Mr Moorer said.

But the band director's concerns soon melted away when he saw Taranza perform.

'He did his performance and the crowd just loved it,' Mr Moorer told News One.
