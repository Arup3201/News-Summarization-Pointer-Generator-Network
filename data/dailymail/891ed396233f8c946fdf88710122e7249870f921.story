The Juice People says that its Hay Fever Aid (pictured) combines anti-histamine and anti-inflammatory ingredients

For the millions of hayfever sufferers hiding indoors seeking shelter from high pollen counts, a new juice could be the key to banishing the seasonal sniffles.

One company claims they have found a healthy and tasty way to relieve the incessant sneezing,  runny nose and streaming eyes that blights sufferers' summers.

And the good news is you can blend the remedy yourself.

The Juice People, based in Covent Garden, London, says its Hayfever Aid combines anti-histamine and anti-inflammatory ingredients, offering an alternative remedy to dreaded condition.

They claim the tasty juice helps relieve symptoms, ‘without any of those drowsy drugs leaving you skipping through the summer'.

The concoction, which includes pineapple, lemon, apple and ginger, is full of vitamin C ‘to enhance its pollen-leveling effects and minimise the immune system’s response’.

According to the NHS, hayfever affects one in five people at some point in their lives and this year, the pollen count is said to be twice as high as usual.

The number of hayfever sufferers in the UK will double to reach 30 million in the next two decades as rising pollution levels trapping pollen in the atmosphere, experts have warned and 15million Britons are already battling the symptoms.

Adrianna Stoyanova, in-house nutritionist at The Juice People, advises sufferers should drink the juice every morning throughout the hayfever season, which runs from late March to September, and reach for another throughout the day if they need it.

‘The juice works as a fabulous alternative to conventional Hayfever remedies,' she told MailOnline.

'The ingredients have natural anti-histamine and anti-inflammatory properties that help to supress and relieve the symptoms of hay fever as well as aiding your body in the fight against the pollen.

‘The pineapple, apple and lemon produce a serious kick of vitamin C a powerful antioxidant that you should be taking more of throughout the summer if you suffer from hayfever.

The concoction, which includes pineapple, lemon, apple and ginger, is full of vitamin C 'to enhance its pollen-leveling effects and minimise the immune system's response,' the firm says.

‘The 
nutrients in the juice work to enhance the anti-histamine and 
anti-inflammatory effects making it the perfect daily remedy to your 
fight against hayfever.

‘Ideally
 the juice should be consumed every morning throughout hay fever season 
and a few weeks in advance if possible, then supplemented in the day if 
symptoms are particularly bad.

‘As an all-natural remedy this fights with your body rather than against it and also helps to boost energy and aid nutrition.’

Blend…

Juice all the ingredients and pour over ice.

The juice shops, which create different blends of healthy juices, such as the Green Super Power, use industrial centrifugal juicers and blenders to slowly extract the juice from fruit, while retaining its nutrients, but the recipe can be easily made at home.

Traditionally people have turned to various different natural remedies to ease their hayfever symptoms.

They include a spoonful of honey in the morning, thought to desensitise sufferers to pollen.

The theory goes that because the pollen bees collect is the heavy-grained variety, it doesn't cause problems.

Other natural remedies include chamomile tea with lemon oil and a concoction of boiled grapefruit and lemon juice, while others drink peppermint tea to relieve sinus and nasal congestion.

For those more in favour of a traditional remedy, Boots UK Pharmacist Angela Chalmers said experts are always on hand to offer advise.

She told MailOnline: 'With a range of options available to help you stay in control of your hayfever you do not have to let a tingly nose or watery eyes keep you fron making the most of the outdoors.

'You can get great tips and guidance from your local pharmacist.'
