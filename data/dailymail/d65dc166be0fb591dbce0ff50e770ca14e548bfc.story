As if the flooding and transport chaos hasn’t been bad enough already, now drivers face a new weather-related menace  –  potholes.

And it has come at a hefty price.

Motorists are paying out more than £1billion a year on car repairs to rectify the damage caused by cracks and pits in the roads.

Record-breaking wet weather from last year has resulted in an ‘enormous increase’ in the number of potholes.

Last month, an AA survey found that drivers and cyclists had to tackle an average of just over six potholes per mile.

But following December’s downpours, many road surfaces have deteriorated further.

A study by Halfords Autocentres found that 8million vehicles a year suffer steering and suspension damage as a result of poorly-maintained road surfaces – with one driver affected every four seconds.

The average repair bill is estimated to cost £135.

The figures show that last month complaints over potholes almost doubled since a year ago. 

Councils were being notified at a rate of 54 a day in December, a 60 per cent increase on the average for the year.

Blame the weather: Rain and floods in many parts of the country have cause more potholes than ever to appear on Britain's roads

The recent wet weather has made a bad situation worse. In Oxfordshire, one stretch of road was torn apart after days of heavy rain.

A long rift opened up along the Oxford Road in Hinksey Hill, exposing layers of dirt and gravel as parts of the surface sank.

With two-feet wide cracks in places, the through-road has now been sealed off by engineers.

Paul Watters, AA head of roads policy, said: ‘The wet weather has had a massive impact on our roads. Our patrols are reporting an enormous increase in the amount of potholes. The heavy rain will have aggravated those that are already there, and brought about new ones.

No through route: The figures were revealed as it emerged a landslide left a bridge connecting the tiny village of Ovington, County Durham, to a major commuter route impassable - adding ten miles to residents' journeys

Cracked: The stone bridge has been left twisted and crumbling with huge cracks in the tarmac

Inconvenience: Rain towards the end of December caused the bridge to sink down an embankment and it has been shut ever since

‘But it will also have affected the 
substructure of the road - in some instances we have even seen the base 
of the road washed away.

‘And
it is still early days. Once we have freezing weather, we will see 
frost and ice causing further damage to the road surface.

‘The full scale of the problem will only emerge in the next few months.’

Last year, the Asphalt Industry Alliance, which carries out an annual road maintenance survey, found the number of potholes filled in across England and Wales had nearly doubled in five years, to almost 1.7million.

A spokesman said: ‘What we are hearing is that the extreme rain fall that we have experienced this year has had quite a devastating effect on the roads.

‘We have seen huge areas of the country where the ground has been saturated, and this affects the foundations of the roads.

'It will certainly be expensive to repair and we would not be surprised to see increasing numbers of potholes and serious cracks as a result.’

Many local authorities have been warning motorists that potholes are on the rise as a result of the wet weather.

Following the recent flooding in the south west, councils said up to £20million is needed to repair the damage to the region’s roads.

Devon County Council estimates the repair bill will cost taxpayers £10million, while authorities in Cornwall have earmarked £7million for the damage caused by the downpours in November and December.

Counting the cost: Rectifying the damage caused 
by potholes, such as these in Hull, East Yorkshire, left, and Finchley, 
north London, right, can be unexpectedly costly, with an average repair 
bill of £135

Disparity: Some regions had far higher 
incidences of pothole damage than others. Pictured: potholes in Glasgow,
left, and Liverpool, right

Plymouth City Council also expects long-term costs of up to £3million.

Austerity measures will see road maintenance grants fall by almost £100million this year, and as a result many councils are being forced to mend rather than replace damaged roads.

Over the long term, the estimated cost to ‘patch and mend’ rather than to plan proper road maintenance is 20 times greater.

Last month ministers announced an extra £215million for councils to carry out repairs, from money put aside for roads in Chancellor George Osborne’s Autumn Statement.

The figures were revealed as it emerged a landslide left a bridge connecting the tiny village of Ovington, County Durham,  to a major commuter route impassable - adding ten miles to residents' journeys.

The stone bridge has been left twisted and crumbling with huge cracks in the tarmac.

The closure restricts access to the A67 which links County Durham to North Yorkshire.

Rain towards the end of December caused the bridge to sink down an embankment and it has been shut ever since.

Expensive: Drivers from the North East being hit hardest with a £181 million bill, closely followed by motorists in the Midlands who pay out around £175 million for repairs

The village is still accessible from the south via Hutton Magna but traffic from Winston is being diverted via Caldwell.

Residents
said the bridge, which has a 7.5ft weight limit and is listed, has been
put under considerable strain as a result of heavy farm traffic driving
over it.

Rory
Carlin from Halfords Autocentres said: 'Even hitting a small pothole 
can easily damage wheels, tyres and affect steering alignment but 
serious suspension damage is becoming a more common occurrence.

'From bent anti-roll bars to damaged 
shock absorbers, the problems are exacerbated by three factors; the 
inability of local authorities to keep pace with highway maintenance, an
ageing vehicle fleet more susceptible to damage as drivers keep cars 
for longer and component complexity, which drives up the cost of each 
individual repair.'

Some 
regions had far higher incidences of pothole damage than others, with 
drivers from the North East being hit hardest with a £181 million bill, 
closely followed by motorists in the Midlands who pay out around £175 
million for repairs.

Those 
areas where drivers are least likely to encounter costly problems are 
Wales and the East of England where the repair bills for pothole-related
damage are £53 million and £58 million respectively - though lower 
traffic density, rather than better quality of road surface, may be 
masking the true underlying threat.

Councils, local authorities and the 
Highways Agency have a duty of care under The Highways Act to take 
reasonable measures to ensure that problems such as potholes are found 
and dealt with swiftly.

However,
since the initial cost of pothole repairs is borne by the driver it is 
they who must prove the relevant authority has failed to meet this 
obligation in order to make a claim, which is time consuming and far 
from straight-forward.

Typically
any driver seeking to recoup repair costs must prove that the relevant 
authority does not have a robust system for dealing with road surface 
issues, or that it fails to meet the national recommended code of 
practice for highway maintenance.

Mr
Carlin added: 'The funding gap is hitting motorists hard. This is 
clearly not sustainable in the long term and we are currently looking 
for ways in which we can support drivers who encounter potholes whilst 
the authorities remain unable or unwilling to act.'
