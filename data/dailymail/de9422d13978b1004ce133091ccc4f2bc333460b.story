Fans will be able to report any racist abuse at Sunday’s Capital One Cup final by phoning a hotline number printed on the back of every ticket.

The instant ‘shop-a-yob’ is one of the extra measures put in place to combat racist behaviour at the showdown between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley.

The issue of racism in football has been highlighted in the past couple of weeks with incidents involving Chelsea and West Ham supporters.

There are fears it could occur on Sunday, given Chelsea fans’ history of singing derogatory chants about Tottenham’s Jewish heritage.

As a result, more than 100 specialist stewards will be inside the stadium while police spotters and detectives will be on hand to investigate any alleged incidents.

This follows talks between Wembley, the Football League, Chelsea, Tottenham, supporter and anti-discrimination organisations and Jewish community groups.

The FA’s ‘Report It!’ film, which explains how fans should react to discriminatory behaviour, will also be shown during the build-up to Sunday’s clash.

Chelsea have already warned their fans they face being banned if found guilty of anti-Semitic behaviour. And statements, which have been issued exclusively to Sportsmail, from Wembley and the Football League will reinforce that message.

A Wembley spokesman said: ‘Police and stewards will be monitoring fan behaviour outside and inside the stadium, respectively.

'There will be appropriate messaging communicated to both sets of fans at Wembley including how supporters can immediately report discriminatory behaviour via their mobile phone or tablet device.

‘Details of how to do this are also on the back of every match ticket. Anyone engaging in anti-social or discriminatory behaviour will be ejected from the ground, face arrest and a lifetime ban from attending football matches at Wembley.’

A Football League spokesman added: ‘The crowd management and security operation at Sunday’s final will be overseen by Wembley Stadium in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police and we will provide any support that is requested. 

‘As ever, the overwhelming majority of supporters will be a credit to their club, however The Football League expects a firm line to be taken with anyone engaging in discriminatory language or behaviour.’
