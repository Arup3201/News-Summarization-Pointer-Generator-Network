Suing: Prison guard Jeremy Stodghill, pictured, filed the lawsuit after his wife, Lori, died of a heart attack at St Thomas More hospital in Canon City, Colorado, along with her unborn twin boys in 2006

A Catholic hospital has defied its own long-held belief that life begins at conception by arguing that fetuses are not people in a wrongful death case.

Prison guard Jeremy Stodghill filed the lawsuit after his wife, Lori, died of a heart attack at St Thomas More hospital in Canon City, Colorado, along with her unborn twin boys in 2006.

The heavily pregnant 31-year-old was brought into the hospital's emergency room on New Year's Day, vomiting and with shortness of breath.

By the time Mr Stodghill parked his car and returned to the ER, she'd lost consciousness. Less than an hour later, she suffered a fatal heart attack and her twins died with her, having been left inside her womb.

But Mr Stodghill is arguing the twins could have been saved if doctors had performed a perimortem Cesarean section.

Despite being paged by the hospital, the on-call obstetrician, Dr Pelham Staples, who was also Lori's personal obstetrician, never arrived. Mr Stodghill recalls speaking to him on the phone.

'He said, "Well, what do you want to do? Take the babies? Take the babies?"' Jeremy told Westword.com News. 'I kept responding, "I'm not a doctor!"'

A nurse listened for fetal heartbeats but didn't hear any so the ER doctor John Pelner decided against a Cesarean section. Eventually all three were pronounced dead.

Two years later, Mr Stodghill sued the hospital, Dr Staples and Dr Pelner for the wrongful deaths of his wife and twins.

The hospital, and the healthcare provider that runs it, Catholic Health Initiatives, which operated 78 Catholic hospitals in 17 states, have argued that nothing could have been done to save Ms Stodghill.

But despite claiming to follow the 
directives of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops that states the 
sanctity of life begins 'from the moment of conception until death,' 
Catholic Health's lawyers have turned the teachings of the Church on 
their head in their defense against the twins' deaths.

They are arguing that a fetus is not a person and 'unborn persons' cannot be the subject of a wrongful death case because they do not have the same rights as those born alive.

One of the defense attorneys, Jason Langley, argued in documents filed with the Colorado Supreme Court that the judge 'should not overturn the long-standing rule in Colorado that the term "person," as is used in the Wrongful Death Act, encompasses only individuals born alive. Colorado state courts define "person" under the Act to include only those born alive. Therefore Plaintiffs cannot maintain wrongful death claims based on two unborn fetuses.'

Many Catholics are supporting the Stodghills over the church in the court battle because they believe a win for the plaintiffs would be a win for pro-life advocates.

The Catholic Health attorneys have so far won decisions from Fremont County District Court and the Colorado Court of Appeals based on this argument but in September, the Stodghill's appealed the case to the state Supreme Court. It is not yet clear whether the high court will hear the case or send it back to the appellate court.

Many Catholics are outraged, believing the stance goes against the pro-life cause
