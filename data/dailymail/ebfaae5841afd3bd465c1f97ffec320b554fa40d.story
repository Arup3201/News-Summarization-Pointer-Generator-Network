Mick Philpott and wife Mairead stood side by side in the dock for the second day in a row today accused of killing their six children in an arson attack.

People in the public gallery shouted 'fake tears' and 'scum' during the hearing at Nottingham Crown Court.

Another man walked out half way 
through the hearing and said 'disgrace' with his arms out and fingers 
pointing towards the couple.

And once again, Mairead wore a vest top which exposed the heartbreaking tattoo or intertwining roses which bears her late children's names.

The judge, The Honourable Mr Justice Charles Haddon-Cave, remanded the pair into custody after a short hearing.

The couple are charged with murder following the house fire which ripped through their home in Allenton, Derby, on May 11.

Their children Jade, 10, and brothers
John, nine, Jack, seven, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, all died in the
fire, and a sixth sibling Duwayne, 13, died of his injuries in 
Birmingham Children’s Hospital two days later.

No applications for bail were made today and a date was set for the case to be heard again.

Mr Philpott, who wore a white sports 
vest top, stared down at the floor in the dock while Mrs Philpott, who 
wore a blue sweater and her red hair loose, appeared tearful.

Yesterday, as they made their first 
court appearance, they were branded ‘scum’ and ‘b******s’ by a woman 
screaming abuse from the public gallery.

Then they were led handcuffed to the 
cells and remanded in custody as detectives continued to piece together 
how and why the youngsters came to die at their home.

Mairead, 31, had the names of her children tattooed on her right arm as she stood in the dock in a sleeveless white summer dress.

Anger: Members of the public react as a prison van, believed to be carrying the Philpotts, leaves Nottingham Crown Court after the hearing today

Emotions: People react as the van leaves the court. Inside people in the public gallery shouted 'fake tears' and 'scum' as Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead appeared before a judge

Mick Philpott, 55, shook his head from
side to side when the charges were read. He leaned forward to blow a 
kiss to one of his relatives and mouthed an obscenity at detectives 
before leaving the court.

Three weeks ago he had been hailed as a
hero credited with ‘valiant’ attempts to save the children as fire 
swept through the three-bedroom council house.

Back in May 2003, when the couple 
married in a church near Derby, with four-year-old Duwayne as a pageboy 
and baby Jade as a bridesmaid, family and friends gathered to join the 
celebration.

Yesterday some of those same people 
were among 21 who filed solemnly into Court One at Southern Derbyshire 
magistrates court to see the pair face accusations of murder.

Grief: Mick and Mairead Philpott cried at a news 
conference about the fire, which killed six of their children

Yesterday the hearing – the first time the 
couple have been brought to court since being charged – began with the 
sound of footsteps and the rattle of chains as a door swung open into 
the dock. Mick Philpott walked in first. He wore tracksuit trousers and a
sleeveless grey vest that showed off the tattoos on otherwise bare 
arms. A small, slight, man, he was dwarfed by the security guard to whom
he was handcuffed.

It took just a few paces to get from 
one end of the dock to the other but he covered the distance with a 
slight swagger, like an amateur fighter entering the ring.

Mairead was led in behind him. Even away from the female guards who flanked her, she looked tiny.

Sixth victim: Duwayne Philpott, 13, died in hospital after his life support machine was turned off

Their address was given as a Premier Inn in Derby, with their house now a tragic, blackened crime scene.

Detectives have established the fire was started deliberately with petrol at the front door.

‘Scum!’ a woman shouted from the 
public seats yards from the dock. ‘B******s! Scum!’ Twenty-one heads in 
the family seats began to bob up over the rail to identify the source of
the interruption. It was a thirty-something woman in dark glasses who 
had earlier been queuing outside with an grey-haired man in a vest.

Mick Philpott, arms folded, simply 
fixed the pair with a stare. The couple ignored presiding magistrate 
Kath Heap’s warning that she wouldn’t tolerate disruption, and police 
duly escorted them out.

No plea was entered and no application
for bail was made by the couple, who were represented by different 
solicitors. The case was sent to be heard at Nottingham Crown Court 
today.

Mrs Heap told the couple they would be
remanded in custody on grounds that they might interfere with 
witnesses, ‘and for your own protection’.

Philpott, a father of 17 children by 
five women, became known as ‘Shameless Mick’ in 2007 after demanding a 
larger house to share with Mairead, his girlfriend Lisa Willis and eight
of his offspring.
