Failed heist: Kyle Handley (pictured above) is one of the four arrested for kidnapping a medical marijuana dispensary owner and sexually mutilating him in the desert while trying to rob him

Four people were arrested and charged this week for kidnapping a man, burning him with a blow torch and severing his penis while trying to extort money they believe he buried in the desert.

In addition to 34-year-old Kyle Handley, who was arrested a year ago, police apprehended Ryan Kevorikan, 34, and Naomi Kevorkian, 33, in Fresno, California on Friday.

A fourth suspect, 34-year-old Hossein Nayeri, was arrested on Thursday in the Czech Republic and is facing extradition. He fled to Iran after the crime and was flying to visit family in Spain at the time of his arrest.

Prosecutors said the four people in their thirties carried out a plan to kidnap the owner of a California medical marijuana dispensary when they believed he was hiding money in the Mojave desert.

The plans for the kidnapping were put in motion after Handley went on an 'extravagant and expensive' trip to Las Vegas with the victim and other growers. Handley supplied the 29-year-old victim's marijuana dispensary.

When he returned from the trip, Handley told the three others that the victim  was 'extremely wealthy' and they developed a plan to rob him.

For weeks, the four staked out the victim's home and followed him on several trips he took to the Mojave Desert.

They believed he was hiding money in the desert, when in reality he was looking into an investment deal.

On October 2, 2012, the four broke into the victim's home by using a ladder to climb up to the Balboa Peninsula home's deck.

The plan: The group of four conspired to rob the 29-year-old victim who they believed was 'extremely wealthy' and his stashes of money in the Mojave Desert

Inside, they found their target as well as his roommate's 53-year-old girlfriend. They tied up both before driving them off to the Mojave Desert.

In the secluded desert, the group tortured the man in an attempt to make him reveal his hidden stash of money.

They beat him up, burned him with a blow torch and even chopped off his penis.

That's when they knew for sure there was no buried treasure.

They decided to abandon the man and woman in the desert, taking the penis with them so that it couldn't be reattached. They also poured bleach all over the man believing it would destroy any DNA evidence connecting them to the incident.

After the group drove off, the woman ran for a mile down the side of the road and eventually flagged down a police car.

According to authorities, the male victim spent 'an extensive period of time in the hospital recovering from his injuries'.

Authorities connected the four to the crime after a 'thorough extensive investigation'.

Initially, police pegged Handley because the car neighbors reported seeing outside the victim's home was registered to him.

The other three were linked to the crime through DNA evidence.

All four were charged Friday with two felony counts of kidnapping and first degree residential burglary.

If convicted, they could spend the rest of their lives in prison without the possibility of parole. Handley already plead not guilty to all of the charges last month.
