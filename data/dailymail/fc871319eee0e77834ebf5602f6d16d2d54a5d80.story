It was the first day of New York Fashion Week and the debut of Kanye West's collaboration with Adidas.

But the rapper had without a doubt the most star-studded front row of the shows so far, with the likes of Beyonce, Jay Z, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and of course, his wife Kim Kardashian sitting pride of place.

Reality star Kim was happily wedged in between her new BFF Beyonce and US Vogue editor Anna Wintour.

His biggest fans: Kim  took 20-month-old North to see Kanye's NYFW debut

The 34-year-old had brought along daughter North, but the toddler apparently grew upset ahead of the show and was taken backstage.

Her youngest sister Kylie Jenner, 17, was among the models who featured in the presentation, while pro Kendall watched from the sidelines. 

Kim, who told the latest issue of LOVE magazine that Kanye encourages her to 'dress sexier', did just that for the occasion in a camouflage mini-skirt and jacket. 

Star-studded turnout: Jay Z, Beyonce, Wintoour, Hailey Baldwin, and Russell Simmons sat with Kim in the front row for the show

The crowd kept on growing: P Diddy was also in attendance, sitting next to Jay Z

Crowd pleaser: The stars in attendance applauded the show

Kim teamed the thigh-skimming skirt and bulky coat with a tight brown top and stockings tucked into boots.

The 34-year-old left her raven locks loose and went for her signature make-up, featuring mauve lipstick, strong eyebrows and lashings of mascara.

She cradled little North in her arms, and the youngster looked adorable in a brown knitted jumper, black jeans and boots. 

Dropping in: The happy couple posed with pop sensation Rihanna, who Kanye just collaborated with on FourFive Seconds

Get army chic!

Kim Kardashian carried baby North to Kanye West's fashion show in an oversized camouflage jacket that looked almost as it if it were borrowed from her hubby.

We're not used to seeing Miss Kimmy K. in anything but form fitting designer duds, but we're really loving this loose look on her.

The reality star has definitely been bringing back this 1990's trend as of late - she was spotted in a pair of Faith Connection camouflage pants just the other day. Take a page from Kim's style files to nab her look with one of the picks from our edit below.

Both Saint Laurent and Rag & Bone make high end versions of the trend or opt for a real deal with a Rothko jacket on sale for only $73.95! Our favorite item here at Fashion Finder HQ is a Levi's mixed media camo bomber, which at $140.00 is also a style steal.

A fur coat was wrapped around 65-year-old Wintour's shoulders as Kanye sported a hooded jumper.

Meanwhile, Rihanna turned every head when she rocked up to the venue in a very bizarre black denim off-the-shoulder creation, which featured a furry panel across the chest and culottes.

The 30-year-old styled her ombre hair in waves and sported deep red lipstick and bronze eyeshadow.
