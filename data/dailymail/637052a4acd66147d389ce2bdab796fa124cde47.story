Tory councils minister Brandon Lewis admitted this morning that he had 'mixed memory' over what he could and could not recycle at home

Minister for local councils Brandon Lewis was forced to admit this morning that even he is so baffled by recycling rules he did not know what he could put in his green waste bin.

The Tory MP - who is responsible for the English and Welsh local authorities which set the complicated recycling rules  - said the key to helping people recycle was to 'keep things simple'.

Mr Lewis, the MP for Great Yarmouth, said his local council in Norfolk was 'pretty clear about what you can and can't recycle' - but then had to admit he did not know the rules himself.

He told BBC Breakfast presenter Charlie Stayt that he was allowed to throw yoghurt pots in the recycling in Great Yarmouth. 

The top Tory, who was a council leader for five years, said he was 'sure' he was allowed to recycle yoghurt pots and butter contrainers. 

But he was later forced to admit this was wrong and that his wife had had to correct him. Mr Lewis said he had a 'mixed memory'.

It came after the Mr Stayt asked him on TV this morning: 'Where you live, can you put yoghurt pots in your recycling?

Mr Lewis said: 'Yes we can actually.' But the presenter responded: 'Do you know that for sure, I’m not trying to catch you out, it is just, the practicalities are the things that trouble people most, and you know that for sure do you, you know absolutely you can put yoghurt pots, butter containers for example, the different types of plastic, you know which one you can and which one you can’t for your own area.'

The Tory minister said: 'Yes and to be fair my council which is Great Yarmouth are pretty good at educating people and making people very clear about what they can and can’t recycle.'

Mr Lewis then went on Twitter, to say that he had been on BBC Breakfast talking 'about waste collection'. He said: 'Need to be easy and regular for residents.'

He then tweeted a link to the Great Yarmouth recycling rules 'for clarity'.

But the rules state: 'No plastics other than bottles (yogurt pots, food containers, film/bags etc need to go in your grey bin).'

BBC Breakfast then wrote on Twitter: 'Seems recycling IS confusing. Minister @BrandonLewis said he could recycle yogurt pots, but has since admitted he got it wrong.'

'Great Yarmouth Council says you can't recycle yogurt pots etc.'

Mr Lewis then responded to say he had got confused - and had been ticked off by his wife for getting it wrong.

He claimed he had a 'mixed memory'. He said: 'Yep, wife already corrected me too, mixed memory re yogurt vs plastic bottles which are ok, confirms point re #keepitsimple.'

Families are often left baffled by which bins to use for their rubbish. In Stoke,  pictured here, people had to cope with nine different recycling bins

Mr Lewis later said his confusion proved why councils needed to keep things simple.

He said the councils needed to make things 'really easy' for people. Mr Lewis said: 'My experience is the best way to get recycling up is to make it really easy for people to do it.'

'We spend about £122 a month on council tax and the main thing for them is to collect our rubbish and we expect a really good service.

'Over the last 10 or 15 years councils have moved away from weekly collections and tried to force people to recycle by having less than a weekly collection and it doesn’t work.

'People need to understand and we need to make it easier for people to recycle.

'Councils can choose how they provide their services - that is an important part of localism - but they should go for the easiest ways of recycling.'

Mr Lewis appeared on the show over claims more than 100,000 tonnes of 'contaminated' recycling ended up in landfill last year, despite families carefully sorting their rubbish at home.

A Labour source said: 'It’s important to recycle our waste properly but it appears the Minister responsible has no idea what he’s doing himself.'

But Mr Lewis said: 'As you saw this morning recycling yogurt pots and other household waste can be a complicated and confusing matter. This Government is working with councils to make it as easy and accessible as possible.

'All the evidence suggests that when recycling is simple, more people do it, which is better for the environment and reduces long term pressure on landfill sites.'
