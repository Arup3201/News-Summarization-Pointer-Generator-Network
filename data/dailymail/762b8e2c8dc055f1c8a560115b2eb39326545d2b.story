The mystery over the  appearance of envelopes stuffed with cash arriving at people’s homes deepened  yesterday when more beneficiaries came forward.

Three people were known to have received the windfalls through the post, all sent second class and with the address written in the same spidery handwriting.

The only link appeared to be that they live, or had lived, in the same street in Colchester.

Shock: Lesley Quilter, 58, said she has been ¿going crazy¿ trying to work out who would want to send her £200

But another three – all from different
 roads in the town – have received cash. A total of £1,200 has been 
handed out in the past few weeks.

Dennis Barnes has had two letters – the first with £200 and the second with £100.

The 75-year-old lives in Barn Hall Avenue, two miles from Wickham Road where the acts of generosity first came to light.

He said: ‘It really is a mystery. There is no way of tracking it.

‘I used to work in the building  trade so I thought it could have  been an old customer but I can’t think of anyone.’

Charlie
 Williams, 76, a former  soldier who moved to the garrison town in 1979 
and later became a  contracts manager, found £200 on his doormat in 
Nancy Smith Close.

‘It would
 be nice to find out who it is – it would put my mind at rest,’ he said.
 ‘I do so many favours for people and I have been told by elderly  
people I’ve done bits for “When I die, I’ll leave you something”.’

Another £200 was sent to Tony Dutch, 68, of Babel Road.

Doreen Neal, 86, who received the cash in £20 notes, said the only link between the three recipients was that they had all lived in the road

The
 retired electrical engineer  said: ‘My real name is Anthony but the 
letter was addressed to Tony, so it made me think it was someone who 
knows me.

‘It definitely looks like an elderly person’s writing – I haven’t got a  clue who it is. I don’t know what  the link is.’

The
 first person to receive the money was retired office worker Doreen 
Neal, 86, who got £100 early last month. She lives around 50 yards away 
from Lesley Quilter, 58, who was given £200.

Mrs
 Quilter’s brother-in-law, Peter Dowman, who was gifted £200, used to 
live next door to her until 1979 when he moved to Fingringhoe, a village
 a few minutes away.

The mystery deepened when Mrs Quilter¿s brother-in-law, who used to live in Wickham Road, was sent £200

Checks by the Daily Mail revealed the letters appear to have been posted somewhere in a fairly wide radius around Chelmsford.

But
 there appears to be no other part of the puzzle that links the 
different people together, other than that they live in Colchester.

Mrs
 Neal said yesterday: ‘None of the new names ring a bell with me at all.
 I don’t think even Sherlock Holmes could solve this mystery.’

Royal Mail said that cash should not be posted using the standard delivery service.
