Chris Huhne was facing an inquiry 
last night after it was revealed his girlfriend touted for work boasting
she had access to Cabinet ministers.

Carina Trimingham contacted top 
lobbying companies in London suggesting she could get their clients in 
front of senior members of the Coalition.

In an extraordinary email, which she 
appears to have sent with her CV to most of the major public relations 
companies in London, the 45-year-old former journalist and PR consultant
said she had ‘excellent contacts… from Cabinet members to more junior 
ministers’.

The email, also sent in letter form, urges them to ‘make use of my skills and contacts’.

A senior PR source said: ‘I’ve seen her letter and I believe she has sent it to all of us.’

Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Mr 
Huhne has denied any wrongdoing. His spokesman said: ‘There is no 
question of a conflict of interest as Chris Huhne understands Carina 
Trimingham does not intend to accept any work that touches on his 
departmental responsibilities.’

But a senior Lib Dem source last night conceded it was ‘not sensible’ for Miss Trimingham to have sent out the email.

Labour MP Paul Flynn wrote to the 
Prime Minister to demand an investigation into whether the ministerial 
code had been breached. He said: ‘This is completely shameless. It is 
entirely wrong that she should be hawking around her contacts with her 
Cabinet minister boyfriend and his pals.’

The ministerial code states that 
ministers are responsible for ensuring that ‘no conflict arises, or 
could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and 
their private interests, financial or otherwise’.

In his letter Mr Flynn says: ‘If 
these allegations are true it suggests a very worrying situation if 
relatives, partners or others closely connected with Cabinet Ministers 
are offering their contacts to the highest bidder.’

Miss Trimingham last night defended 
her actions, saying: ‘As a former political journalist for 12 years, I 
have many friends and acquaintances in all parties.

‘I have worked in communications and 
public relations, including with the Liberal Democrats. Obviously in any
role I take, it will not involve energy and climate change and there 
will be no conflict of interest.’

Mr Huhne is already facing a  
criminal investigation into claims by his ex-wife Vicky Pryce who has 
alleged he persuaded her to take his penalty points for a speeding 
offence.

He left his wife for Miss Trimingham last year after 26 years of marriage as their affair came to light.

Miss Trimingham, who has previously 
worked as Mr Huhne’s press officer, accompanied him to this year’s 
Liberal Democrat Party conference.

Labour MP John Mann, who led 
criticism against Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox before he was forced to 
resign last month over the way he allowed his friend Adam Werritty to 
tag along to meetings, branded government links to the lobbying industry
as ‘incestuous’.

He said: ‘It is no good for Chris 
Huhne’s partner to say she won’t lobby on a particular issue because of 
his ministerial responsibility because in government that can change.

‘It puts Chris Huhne in an impossible
position. It is not in the interests of a Cabinet minister for his 
partner, or any family member, to be working in the lobbying industry. 
It absolutely should not happen.

Miss Trimingham’s attempts to find work have highlighted a loophole in the rules.

When Miss Pryce left her job at the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to take up a position 
with U.S. financial firm FTI, the move had to be vetted by the Advisory 
Committee on Business Appointments.

As a former senior civil servant she 
was barred from lobbying members of the Government for a year. But Miss 
Trimingham does not have to have any future position approved.
