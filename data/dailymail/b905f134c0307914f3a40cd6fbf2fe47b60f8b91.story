Prisons were not ready for the sudden influx of inmates that occurred following the summer riots, a report by inspectors has found.

With 60 inmates arriving in the space of a week, Feltham Young Offenders' Institute in West London struggled to cope with the demand and fights regularly broke out with those already being held there concerned that rioters had 'destroyed their turf'.

Many of those involved in the disturbances had also been abandoned by their families who had even considered moving home, shamed by their actions and affected by their communities' reactions.

The number of young offenders put on 
suicide watch increased by 200 per cent while many experienced gangs and
violence for the first time.

Feltham Young Offenders' Institute struggled to cope after the riots as 60 prisoners arrived in a week - the normal number that is jailed there in a month

Inmates baulked at scenes played out on television inside the prisons by lashing out at those they saw as being responsible for putting their families at risk.

Staff at the jail found that there was 'no central strategy to manage the unprecedented numbers of new arrivals and transfers, including those they were expecting as further arrests were made'.

In one instance there was a 'copycat riot' in the young adults' gym at Feltham but a repeat in the unit holding those under 18 'did not materialise'.

The report by prison inspectors said: 'Young people already in the prison 
had negative perceptions of those involved in the riots as they felt 
that they were responsible for the transfer of their friends to other 
prisons.

'They had seen their home areas attacked on television and were worried about family and friends there.'

Footage of the destruction sparked anger among inmates who then vented their frustration on those they saw responsible for causing the damage

Many young offenders were ostracised by their families after seeing the reaction of their communities and some have even said they want to move because of the fallout

Existing prisoners were moved to 
prevent disturbances, but 'there had been attacks on those involved in 
the riots and this was now the primary cause of fights', the inspectors 
said.

'Young people on different units had 
formed themselves into gangs and there had been fights between units.

'This included those who had not been involved in gangs in the community 
before and who had become part of the unit gang to protect themselves.

'Young people who had not previously 
experienced violence were witnessing it first hand in custody and some 
had become more vulnerable as a result.

'Although there had been no actual 
self-harming, the number of open ACCTs (assessment, care in custody and 
teamwork assessments) had increased by 200 per cent due to staff 
concerns for new young people.'

As those involved in the riots were 
dealt with swiftly by the courts, the number of new arrivals at Feltham 
hit 60 in a week, the same number it would typically expect in a whole 
month, the inspectors said.

With
increasing pressure on space, 70 people had to be moved out of the 
institution within a week with as few as two hours notice.

Most
of them were transferred 200 miles away to Hindley YOI in Wigan and 
many did not have time to let their families know about the move.

Staff
also had little information about new arrivals and the 'huge increase 
of movement across the whole of the under-18 estate' affected both 
newcomers and the settled population.

Chief
inspector Nick Hardwick said that while Feltham 'coped well' overall, 
it was important for all institutions to 'work effectively with young 
people held in custody for the first time to ensure they do not become 
caught in a gang and criminal culture'.

The
Howard League for Penal Reform also received reports that children in 
prisons had been 'advised to walk around in pairs so they were not on 
the landing on their own'.

Frances
Crook, the group's chief executive, said: 'Other prisoners said that 
the rioters had 'destroyed their turf' and beatings had been going on 
all day.

Similar to emergency services tackling the disturbances and fires, prison staff were forced to 'make it up as they went along' in the struggle to cope with the pressure

'One of our lawyers said it was difficult to hear on the telephone as screaming and shouting could be heard in the background.'

She added: 'The Government made it clear that those involved in the riots should expect to go to jail.

'Obeying
political pressure to respond quickly and punitively, the courts 
over-reacted to the civil disturbances of the summer and sent hundreds 
of children to prison, putting them at risk, blighting their life 
chances, and stretching the prison system to its limit.

Chief prisons inspector Nick Hardwick said that Feltham 'coped well' but other institutions should work to prevent young people becoming caught in gang culture

'It is shocking that there was no coherent strategy from central Government for dealing with the massive influx of children sent into custody. Staff were forced to make it up as they went along.'

Penelope Gibbs, director of the Prison Reform Trust's Out of Trouble programme, said: 'Feltham Juvenile YOI was inundated with new arrivals as a result of the riots and this report details the strain on the system.

'The system did cope, just about, but the report begs the question as to whether so many under 18-year-olds needed to be locked up on remand in the wake of the riots.'

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards violence in prisons.

'Those suspected or convicted of rioting received the same treatment as all other prisoners, and any incidents which have taken place have been minor.

'Any incidents should be seen in the context of the age and challenging nature of the population at Feltham.'

Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, added that inspectors found that Feltham was 'fundamentally safe, with good self-harm and violence management, positive staff-prisoner relationships, effective drug interventions and good healthcare and resettlement provision'.

'Feltham has a very challenging population and I am pleased that the work being undertaken to address gang issues has been recognised,' he said.

'At the time of the inspection Feltham was adapting to cope with a higher sentenced population of young people than previously. The Governor will use the chief inspector's report to develop the regime to match the young people's needs and improve activity provision.'
