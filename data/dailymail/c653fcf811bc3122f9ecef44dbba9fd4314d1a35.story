A female reality show contestant committed suicide while the cameras were rolling on one of South Korea’s most watched TV channels.

The woman, a 29-year-old bearing the surname Chun, was taking part in a matchmaking show called Jjak, which translates as The Mate, when she hanged herself.

She was found dead on Wednesday during a week-long location shoot in a house on the southern island of Jeju.

Broadcast on one of South Korea's top three TV stations, SBS, the show sees ten men and women put in the same house for one week while their every move is filmed by a crew.

The tried and tested format sees the contestant take on various challenges throughout the week in the hopes of ending up with a partner at the end of the show.

Ms Chun was found with a note where she had written that she did not want to live any more.

Jjak has been accused of bullying and humiliation in the past, by alienating contestants who do not end up with a partner by making them eat alone as ‘punishment’ for their rejection.

Ms Chun’s mother told the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper that her daughter had said that she would rather leave South Korea than have the show aired on television with the way she had been portrayed.

She had also complained to her friends that she was singled out as a ‘tragic girl’, with ‘too many scenes of me being alone... to highlight matched couples,’ Chosun Ilbo newspaper said.

The channel cancelled the programme set to be broadcast last night, and although they apologised to Ms Chun’s family, they refused to accept any direct responsibility for her suicide.

South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, with an average of 33.5 people per 100,000 taking their lives in 2010, equal to nearly 50 suicides a day.
