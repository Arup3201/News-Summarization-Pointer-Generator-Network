It seemed like a fool-proof plan: lie back and pretend you’re dead while your friends carry you through the streets, demanding compensation for your brutal murder.

And it might have worked for one crafty Chinese street vendor – only he had not counted on the effects of an unusually intense heat wave.

Indeed, the heat was so unbearable the unidentified worker appeared to miraculously rise from the dead – and promptly demand a drink of water.

A sheet-covered vendor's 'corpse' is carried on a gurney as his friends demand compensation for his 'brutal murder'

The 'corpse' suddenly flung off his shroud, sat bolt upright and begged the crowd to quench his thirst

The farcical scene unfolded in Wuhan, roughly 700 miles south of Beijing in the central-eastern province of Hubei, The New York Times has reported.

It started when a crowd of outraged ‘mourners’ carried a seemingly lifeless body on a makeshift gurney through the streets of the city.

Among them were witnesses claiming he had been beaten to death by despised ‘urban management workers’.

The body was covered with a sheet, but the witnesses insisted there was a badly beaten body underneath.

Run-ins between street vendors and 
authorities are commonplace. Several cases of conflicts ending in a 
vendor’s death have outraged the nation.

Urban
management agents – or ‘chengguan’, as they are known – are responsible
for dealing with sanitation complaints, unlicensed construction and 
illegal peddling.

The body was covered with a sheet, but witnesses insisted there was a badly beaten body underneath

Critics say their methods are heavy handed – confiscating goods and doling out stiff fines and stiffer beatings. 

With this backdrop, it’s easy to see why a crowd soon formed around the body – whipped into a frenzy as much by the injustice as by the insane heat of the day.

Scores of people were soon surrounding the body, some with their shirts off and others trying to catch a bit of shade underneath umbrellas.

The core group of demonstrators – the witnesses who had been there when the chengguan 'murder' took place - were demanding tens of thousands of yuan in compensation.

As his friends' demands fell into a sheepish silence, the newly revived chengguan victim was given a bottle of water and allowed to go on his way

But, just when their demands were reaching fever pitch, the body under the sheet started twitching.

Dramatically, the corpse suddenly flung off his shroud, sat bolt upright and begged the crowd to quench his thirst.

As his friends’ demands fell into a sheepish silence, the newly revived chengguan victim was given a bottle of water and allowed to go on his way.

It is unclear whether the local authorities intend to prosecute the man and his friends for their apparent scam, but there is no doubt that some Wuhan residents will forever check for signs of life when presented with a dead body.
