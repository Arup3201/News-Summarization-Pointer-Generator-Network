Cuba will celebrate next week’s Good Friday for the first time since the 1959 Cuban revolution, following a request from Pope Benedict during his visit to the island, according to state media.

Cuban President Raul Castro agreed to Benedict’s request to recognise the day Christians commemorate Jesus’s crucifixion and has declared the day a public holiday.

Benedict requested the holiday as part of Easter celebrations during a meeting with President Raul Castro in Havana on Tuesday, the Vatican said.

The communist government will decide later whether to make Good Friday a permanent holiday, it said.

Castro's
brother, Fidel, ended religious holidays after leading Cuba's 1959 
communist revolution, though he did reinstate Christmas to honour a 
request by Pope John Paul during a visit in 1998 - a trip that marked an
upturn in relations between Cuba and the Church.

Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi welcomed the decision by Cuba as a 'very positive sign'.

'The Holy See hopes that this will 
encourage participation in religious celebrations and in happy Easter 
festivities and that in future, the visit of the Holy Father will 
continue to bear the desired fruit to the benefit of the Church and all 
Cubans,' he said in a statement.

Benedict,
whose three day 'transcendental visit' to Cuba followed a stop in 
Mexico, urged change on the island and asked that the Church be able to 
do more in a time of potentially painful transition.

Raul Castro, who succeeded his older 
brother as president in 2008, has undertaken economic reforms that will 
include the slashing of one million jobs from government payrolls.

The
Pope spent three days visiting the island, meeting Fidel Castro at the 
end to call for a bigger role for the Roman Catholic Church in Cuban 
society.

Benedict met for about half an hour with Fidel Castro, who is a Jesuit-educated altar boy-turned-revolutionary leader.

His 1998 hosting of Pope John Paul II marked a turning point in the church's relations with Cuba.

Pope Benedict XVI used his visit to Cuba last week to criticise the 50-year-old trade embargo imposed by the U.S..

The Pope claimed the blockade, introduced after Cuba’s Communist revolution in 1959 and strengthened three years later, was an unfair burden on Cuba's people after the meeting with Fidel Castro.

The Pontiff, who has now arrived back in Rome, made the comments at Havana airport alongside current president, Fidel's brother Raul, after celebrating Mass in front of huge crowds in Havana.

He said Cubans should be ‘forging a society of wide horizons, renewed and reconciled’.

He added: ‘No one should feel excluded from taking up this exciting search by the limitations of their basic freedoms, or excused from this by indolence or a lack of material resources - a situation which is worsened when restrictive economic measures, imposed from outside the country, unfairly burden its people.'
