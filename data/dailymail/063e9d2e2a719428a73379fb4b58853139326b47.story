When Sue Burton’s teenage son Martin died from a brain haemorrhage, she and her husband Nigel made the courageous decision to donate his organs.

It was a move that saved the life of Scottish teenager Marc McCay as he lay fighting for life in hospital in a race against time for a new heart.

The couple’s gift meant that Marc, then aged 16, received their son’s heart, and is able to live life to the full.

Now, after a friendship which began with an emotional thank you letter, Marc has met the Burtons for the first time – and Mrs Burton has once more been able to feel her son’s heart beating.

Special bond: Marc McCay’s life was saved by Sue Burton’s move to donate her son’s heart

Tragic: Martin Burton died from a brain haemorrhage aged just 16. His mother said of her decision to donate his organs: ‘To stop another mother having the heartbreak of losing her son was the only good that came out of us losing Martin'

Mrs Burton, 55, who lives in Grantham, Lincolnshire, with her husband, formerly of the RAF, said: 'It was the most poignant moment, to put my hand onto Marc’s chest and feel my son’s heart beating there.

‘He reached for my hand and placed it there and it was so emotional. I shed a bucketful of tears.

‘It was so wonderful to meet Marc and his mum Linda. We have been talking through letters and emails, but to meet them both in person was amazing.’

Marc, who is now 27, has three brothers and a sister and lives in Paisley, Renfrewshire. 

He was taken to hospital as a teenager after a virus attacked his heart, causing it to enlarge dangerously.

He said: ‘I’d just returned from a holiday in Ibiza and started to feel unwell. I thought I’d just got a stomach bug but I quickly went downhill. 

'I was admitted to my local hospital but I quickly became unconscious and I was rushed to hospital in Edinburgh.’

Doctors discovered his heart was enlarged and he was immediately put on the list for a heart transplant at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle. He only had hours to live.

A donor heart became available just in time thanks to the brave decision made by the Burtons.

Their son Martin, also 16, had collapsed at home after suffering a brain haemorrhage.

He was taken to hospital in Nottingham and put on a life support machine but doctors told his parents he had suffered irreparable brain damage and nothing could be done to save him.

Mrs Burton, who also has a son Christopher, 32, said: ‘It all happened so quickly, we were just in complete shock.

‘The day before he’d been absolutely fine, until that night when he staggered into my bedroom and collapsed on the bed.

‘Just hours later he was on a life support machine and we were told there was nothing that could be done.

Reunited: Eleven years on, Mr and Mrs Burton recently met with transplant recipient Marc McCay and his mother Linda (both in centre) after exchanging letters and emails

‘We were asked about donating his organs – and as a mother it’s a decision that you never think you will have to make.

‘I can’t begin to describe the shock and the pain at losing our son. But we also knew that he had been young and healthy and it was only his brain that was damaged.

‘We knew that by donating his organs we could save other lives.’

Martin’s heart was taken to the Freeman Hospital where surgeons transplanted it into Marc.

Mrs Burton said: ‘We knew that his heart had gone to a young lad, which was very meaningful.

‘I would have given anything that day to save my son’s life, but I knew it wasn’t possible.

‘To stop another mother having the heartbreak of losing her son was the only good that came out of us losing Martin.’

Grateful: Marc  said he can't thank Mr and Mrs Burton enough for making the brave decision that saved his life 

Marc made a good recovery after his heart transplant and was allowed home after two months.

His mother Linda, 51, then wrote to the Burtons, thanking them for their decision ten years ago.

They have since written and emailed each other regularly – and finally met for the first time during a charity trip to Canada.

Mrs Burton said: ‘The trip had been organised by the Donor Family Network and we were both invited along. It was an amazing opportunity to meet for the first time.

‘When Marc stepped off the train we were waiting on the platform, and we just hugged. We were both crying, it was such an emotional moment.’

It was at their next meeting, which took place last week, that Marc took hold of Mrs Burton’s hand and placed it on his chest.

She said: ‘When I felt my son’s heart beating in his chest it was such an amazing moment and such a comfort to me after losing Martin.

‘We were very honoured to have met Marc. He’s such a lovely young man and we couldn’t have asked for Martin’s heart to have been given to a nicer person.’

Marc said: ‘I was nervous about meeting Sue and Nigel in person, but it was like we’d known each other forever. It was a very emotional moment. 

'I couldn’t thank them enough for saving my life.’
