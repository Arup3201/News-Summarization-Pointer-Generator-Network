Daniel Laurikietis, 32, has been barred from teaching for life after performing a sex act on a teenager

A drama teacher has been banned from the classroom for life after plying a teenager with alcohol and performing a sex act on her.

Daniel Laurikietis, 32, began contacting the girl through Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and text messaging when she was just 15.

After speaking to her Laurikietis, who taught at Haslingden High School in Rossendale, Lancashire, discovered the teenager had mental health issues.

But instead of referring the issues to someone who was fully qualified, he tried to help her himself, a disciplinary panel said.

Around three years after the contact began, in March 2013, he invited her to his home where they drank together and he performed a sex act on her, the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard.

A Professional Conduct Panel found his actions amounted to 'unacceptable professional conduct, that is misconduct of a serious nature that falls significantly short of the standard of behaviour expected of a teacher'.

The former teacher admitted all the allegations and that he was guilty of 'conduct of a dishonest and sexually motivated nature'.

He had already been warned by the school about 'inappropriate contact with students' by creating an alias Twitter profile six months before the incident with the girl, referred to as Pupil A. 

The panel did not specify the age of the girl when the incident took place. 

NCTL panel chairman Nicolé Jackson told him: 'You have extensively abused your position of trust in relation to a vulnerable pupil with a history of self-harm.

'You exploited that position of trust for your own purposes. You failed to treat Pupil A with dignity and mutual respect.

'Your conduct amounted to a blatant disregard to the need to safeguard Pupil A's well-being.

'Her well-being was affected and put at risk.

'You ignored the policies and practices of the school at which you were employed, despite an earlier warning.'

The panel recommended that Mr Laurikietis should be banned from the profession for life.

Accepting the recommendation, Alan Meyrick - decision-maker on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education Nicky Morgan - said Mr Laurikietis' conduct was 'particularly serious'.

He added: 'It involved a wholly inappropriate relationship with a vulnerable student that culminated in the consumption of alcohol and sexual activity.

'Whilst he has acknowledged his mistakes he has shown little regard for the effect his behaviour had on the pupil concerned.

'In all the circumstances I agree that the order should be without provision for an application to apply for it to be set aside.

'This means that Mr Daniel Laurikietis is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England.

'Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against him, I have decided that Mr Daniel Laurikietis shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach.'

The former teacher now describes himself as a self-employed actor, teacher, director and 'Semi-Professional Geek' on Twitter. 

He posted mostly about sci-fi films including Star Wars and Star Trek alongside comic book characters, and occasional posts ranging from the theatre industry to singers Morissey and Kanye West. One supporter on the site claimed he was still a 'top teacher' despite admitting the allegations.

Mark Jackson, headteacher at Haslingden High, said: 'Mr Laurikietis had already resigned from his post when these allegations came to light.

'However, we followed the correct procedure and the case was fully investigated and appropriately dealt with in his absence.

'We then referred the matter both to the Disclosure and Barring Service and the National College for Teaching and Leadership.'
