Murder detectives in Russia have discovered the bodies of two women found underneath a 'Free Pussy Riot' slogan thought to have daubed in their blood on a wall.

The message backing the recently-jailed Russian female punk band was found on an apartment wall above the bodies of a woman, 76, and her 38-year-old daughter in Kazan, western Russia.

The two women, who are said to have shared a home in the city, are thought to have died from stab wounds between August 24 and 26.

Probe: Murder detectives sealed the door to the apartment while investigating the deaths of the two women in Kazan, western Russia

An investigative committee in Tatarstan said their bodies were discovered on Wednesday.

The murder probe comes a fortnight after female punk band members Maria Alekhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were jailed for two years for a protest against Vladimir Putin.

The trio were found guilty of hooliganism after performing a song critical of the Russian President in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals.

An investigator cautioned that the killer was possibly trying to mislead police by drawing attention to supporters of the punk protesters.

It did not provide the women’s names and did not reveal details about their occupations or whether they had any connection to the band. Russian tabloid Lifenews quoted an unnamed investigator as saying that the bodies were disfigured by multiple stab wounds.

The jailed band members’ attorney said on Twitter that 'what happened in Kazan is horrible,' calling the case 'either a horrendous provocation or a psychopathic' case.

'I am sorry that some freaks are using Pussy Riot’s band name,' Nikolai Polozov was further quoted by Interfax as saying.

In mid-August, a Moscow court 
sentenced three band members to two years in jail for performing a 'punk
 prayer' against President Vladimir Putin at a Moscow cathedral in 
February.

The case has 
polarised Russians. Kremlin-friendly television networks and media 
covered the 'prayer' in mostly negative terms, and the country’s 
dominant Orthodox Church called their stunt sacrilegious. But, hundreds 
of artists, musicians and other intellectuals have signed petitions 
urging authorities to free the band members.

An
 investigator in Kazan told a Russian news agency that the murderer was 
trying to cover up the crime by attributing the murder to the band’s 
supporters.

The criminal 'was trying to avoid suspicion' by misleading police, Andrey Sheptitsky told RBK Daily.

Kristina Potupchik, a pro-Putin blogger and former spokeswoman for a militant youth group known for its violent pranks against opposition and Kremlin critics, said in a post that the band's supporters 'will not get away' after the killing. She also compared them to U.S. mass murderer Charles Manson, who also used the blood of his victims to write on the walls of their houses.

The leader of an Orthodox youth group that has accosted and assaulted Pussy Riot supporters claimed that they are capable of committing "any" crime.

'The infernal force that drives them hates God, believers and humankind in general," Dmitry Tsorionov told Interfax on Thursday. "These people are capable of committing any crime, and nothing but force and law can stop them.'

The country's dominant Orthodox Church has called the band's stunt sacrilegious but hundreds of artists, musicians and other intellectuals have signed petitions urging authorities to free them.

Several wooden crosses that stood outside Orthodox churches in Russia and neighbouring Ukraine have been toppled by people who claimed to be the band’s supporters. The band’s manager and husband of one of the jailed rockers said the band disapproved of the vandalism.

The trial, widely seen as Kremlin-orchestrated, caused an international furore. Celebrities such as Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel urged Russian authorities to free the band.

A poll released today by the state-run VTsIOM polling agency showed that one third of Russians consider the two-year jail sentence too harsh, while another 31% found it appropriate.
