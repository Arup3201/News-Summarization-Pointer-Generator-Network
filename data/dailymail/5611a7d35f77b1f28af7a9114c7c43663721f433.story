As part of a class assignment, inmates at California's oldest prison were tasked with writing their own obituaries - and the results were as startling as they were moving.

The idea was that of UC Berkely journalism professor William Drummond, who teaches a news writing class at San Quentin State Prison, just north of San Francisco. 

'I did it as a way to find out how these guys had reconciled their crimes,' Drummond told The Los Angeles Times. 

'Were they able to take a critical look at what got them in trouble?'

Penning his ending: Convicted  murderer Phoeun You sits against a fence in the exercise yard at San Quentin State Prison in California. He is one of several inmateswho wrote his own obituary for a class project

Repenting: You wrote in his obituary that, after killing someone, he would like save someone before he dies

Cambodian refugee Phoeun You came to America when he was five-years-old.

As a teenager he fell into the wrong crowd, blaming cultural differences, and soon joined an Asian gang.

When he was about 20, You got into a fight outside a high school with a member of a Latino gang.

Reeling from the fight, You went and got a gun, and set about trying to find his rivals from the fight.

Failing that, he opened fire at a random person on the street. 

'It was just a guy who looked like a gang member,' You told The Times. 

'He was close enough.'

He killed the 17-year-old boy, and bystanders were hit by bullets as well.

You was convicted of murder and attempted murder in 1996 and could spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Professor Drummond told the inmates they could make up anything they wanted for their obituary and gave them free creative reign.

Most importantly they had to figure out how they would die. 

You wrote a story about a riot breaking out in San Quentin and how he saves the life of a teacher by stepping in front of a knife.

He is stabbed to death by another inmate.

You said, having killed someone himself, you would like to one day save someone.

'My incarceration, the reason I'm here, is by taking a life. When I leave this world, I would love to leave saving a life,' he said.

Reflective: San Quentin inmate Julian Glenn Padgett, also a convicted murderer, made no mention of his crimes, instead writing that he is killed in an earthquake

Julian Glenn Padgett is serving 31 years to life for first-degree murder, arson, burglary and grand theft.

A charismatic and expressive Ethiopian Jew, Padgett has discovered a love for acting while behind bars, and has appeared in a prison production of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice.

His obituary makes no reference of his crimes.

He paints a story of himself of being outdoorsy and enjoying camping and mountain climbing trips with his friend.

Padgett died 'as a result of a massive earthquake that struck San Quentin State Prison', his obituary said. 

'Earthquakes are memorable. They're forces of nature,' Padgett told The Times.

'To take me out, it would take something like that.'

Emotional: Troy 'Kogen' Williams is serving a 70-years-to-life sentence for armed robbery, carjacking and false imprisonment at San Quentin State Prison

Juan Haines, who is serving 55 years for a string of bank robberies, also did not mention his crimes.

He skips over his death in the obituary, saying he was found dead in his cell on his 55th birthday from natural causes.

But he goes on to reminisce about his childhood and the stages in his life that were positive - where things could have been different.

Haines includes his piece 'quotes' from a classmate about how proactive a student he was in San Diego, including being class president.

'He built the treasury from just a couple of dollars, to several thousand,' the quote said.

'His biggest accomplishment was at Homecoming, our float was the biggest one, and our Junior Class Ball was held at a big fancy hotel. The seniors were somewhat jealous.'

Haines later told The Times that he was thinking about the time when he was 'on track'.

'Once I got derailed, that was it,' he said.
