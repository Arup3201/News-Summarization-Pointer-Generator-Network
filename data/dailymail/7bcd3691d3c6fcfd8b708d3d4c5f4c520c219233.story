With bubble-gum pink hair and a love of zany patterns, she certainly has a unique style.

As she was made a Dame at Buckingham Palace yesterday, designer Zandra Rhodes showed off her daring look in a bold electric blue creation.

And she says her distinctive style is one which others are keen to copy.

Dame Zandra, 74, has accused Kate Moss of ripping off her feather and triangle print design for the model’s recent Topshop collection. Both garments feature long, flowing sleeves, bohemian strip hemlines and a string-tie neckline.

Speaking about Moss’s top, Dame Zandra said: ‘Oh yes, it was a complete knock-off. I just hope that the rest of the world sees it as mine. ’ Her spokesman confirmed: ‘It was first used on a dress in 1971 and we used it again in 2003.’ 

A spokesman for Topshop said: ‘Topshop takes any allegation of intellectual property right infringement extremely seriously.’

Dame Zandra, who received a CBE in 1997, said after yesterday’s ceremony that she had not known the Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant. ‘I’ve been in LA and so busy with my collection that I haven’t paid it any attention, but I will now,’ she said.
