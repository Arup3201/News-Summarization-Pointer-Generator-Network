The elementary school in which seven children died after a monster tornado barreled through an Oklahoma 
City suburb was ready for the twister, despite not having a shelter, experts claim.

Yesterday there was growing disbelief as cost-cutting state leaders revealed that even after a devastating tornado struck the area 14 years ago, most schools in Oklahoma still had no purpose-built shelters.

And as Moore's mayor claimed that the 
death toll could have been over a thousand if so many residents hadn't 
been able to hide in underground shelters, questions were raised about if the children could have survived if they were in a shelter.

Pulled from the rubble: A boy is saved from Plaza Towers Elementary School, which did not have a storm shelter

But Albert Ashwood, director of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, told reporters a shelter would not necessarily have saved more lives at the Plaza Towers Elementary School, where seven children sheltering in above-ground classrooms were killed.

Ken
Trump, a Cleveland-based national school-safety consultant said the 
staff has been well trained in preparing for the tragedy.

'When you have any loss of life, 
especially children, it rips our hearts out. But had the community not 
had that history, the preparedness lessons learned right in their own 
back yard, the losses could have been even worse,' he said reported USA Today.

In May 1999, the area was ravaged by a
fierce tornado that killed 44. Many residents responded by building 
their own underground tornado shelters at their own expense. But, 
incredibly, school children were not afforded the same protection.

Plaza Towers Elementary School was in the direct path of this week's tornado and was reduced to a pile of twisted metal and rubble. Around half the children stayed inside, finding shelter where they could in bathrooms. Seven are believed to have drowned.

An online petition was set up by a member of the public within hours of the tragedy demanding that shelters be put in every school, apartment building and mobile home park in Oklahoma.

Glenn Lewis, the mayor of the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, claimed most schools in the state did not have special shelters except those rebuilt after being destroyed in the 1999 tornado.

'Most of the schools in Oklahoma do not have shelters. It's because of the cost,' he told CNN. 'The new ones that were hit in the 1999 tornado, they do have built-in shelters.'

He insisted that this gaping hole in the city's safety precautions would now belatedly be rectified.

'It's something that we’re definitely going to look at,' he said. 'The school system and the city are two separate entities but I'm sure we’ll be talking to them to try and get them federal emergency money to help rebuild these schools.'

Mark McBride, a state congressman who represents Moore, said he was 'just choking back tears, trying to be strong' as he helped rescuers search through the rubble.

Defending the lack of school tornado shelters, he said education already accounted for a large proportion of local government spending.

'Our budgets are stretched and education takes a lot of the money - 50 plus per cent,' he said.

He admitted school shelters 'had not been a priority' but predicted that would now change.

In an emotional speech during a press conference on Tuesday, Susan Pierce, from Moore Public Schools, said that safety was their priority.

'I would like to extend my sincere sympathies to all those who have suffered losses,' she said. 'Our hearts go out to each of you and please know we are all here with you.'

She added that while the path of the tornado was unpredictable, all storm procedures were implemented at every school site.

It comes as it also emerged 
that a storm shelter program that officials had devised for Moore was 
put on hold just months before the town was flattened by the deadly two 
mile-wide tornado.

Officials had devised a plan to help 
residents build storm shelters and applied for $2 million from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to build safe rooms in 800 
homes in Moore.

'It is the 
desire of the City to assist persons who are in Moore to have a place to
seek refuge from severe weather,' the letter read.

But
a letter which was released by the city in February and first seen by 
the Daily Telegraph shows that the program was put on hold as 
authorities tried to navigate federal regulations.

The officials predicted in the storm 
shelters should receive their final approval date of November 1, 2012.

In
the letter, the city said regulations put in place by FEMA for the 
money were a 'constantly moving target', which had slowed down progress 
at getting federal funds.

In
another complication, the federal grant program that was giving out the
money they desired allocates its funds during Presidential major 
disaster declarations, the letter said.

'Oklahoma
has had few of these declarations in the past couple of years, so there
is not a lot of grant money available,' it explained.

The statement, which was released in February on the city's website, revealed the city's frustrations.

'The
City's safe room rebate program is still "on hold", with not a lot 
changed from our update of last May,' it read. 'We've found that the 
FEMA requirements and their interpretations seem to be a constantly 
moving target, more so with the new wrinkles.'

Officials said they hoped to have another plan submitted by March, yet it is unknown if this went through.

Shelters are not compulsory in the state despite its location in so-called Tornado Alley.

Basements are rare in the state 
because of the damp soil, meaning water seeps into storm cellars and 
basements, which leads to mold and fungus.

Water
pressure can also build up due to the soaked soil, which puts pressure 
on basement walls and the concrete can eventually give way.

'People think they can dodge the bullet,' said Mr McBride when asked why schools had no shelters. 'We haven't had a major one [tornado] since 1999. We're brave and stand in our driveways watching the storms go by.'

Oklahoma's Lieutenant Governor, Todd Lamb, dismissed reports that the ground was so hard in the state that it was impossible to dig out a basement without using dynamite.

He claimed some schools used basements instead of purpose built underground shelters. But he had to admit that the basement under Plaza Towers proved to be a death trap.

'There are basements, there are shelters. But of course not everybody has one,' he said.

Neither Moore nor Oklahoma City have designated public storm shelters, and residents are told to go to their basements or storm cellars if they have them.

If they do not, they are advised to go to interior hallways and to stay away from windows.
