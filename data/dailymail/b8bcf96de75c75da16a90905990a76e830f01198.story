Arsenal have been handed an injury boost with the news that Jack Wilshere could be fit to face Galatasaray. 

The Gunners were facing a crisis in midfield after Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta also suffered substantial knocks at the weekend.

Ramsey - so often the man to drive Arsene Wenger's side forward - is set to miss a month, while Arteta will be out for around three weeks.

Wilshere was forced off against Tottenham after turning his ankle under a Danny Rose challenge

Aaron Ramsey wasn't able to shake off a hamstring problem before the break against Spurs 

That means Wilshere's potential return in the Champions League comes as a significant positive for Arsenal, who need points to get up and running in Europe. 

The situation had looked perilous on Saturday evening. 

Wilshere was eventually forced off against Tottenham in the north London derby after turning his ankle under a challenge from Danny Rose. 

He was the last of the trio to be substituted during the 1-1 draw at the Emirates. Arteta endured a calf problem midway through the first half, while Ramsey failed to shake off a tweaked hamstring. 

It was thought that the Welshman would miss up to six weeks, but the situation isn't quite as bad as first feared.
