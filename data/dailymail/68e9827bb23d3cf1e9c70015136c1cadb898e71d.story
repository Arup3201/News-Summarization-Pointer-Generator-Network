It seems that the Grinch is alive and well and living in Texas. 

A thief who apparently was not very much in the holiday spirit stole an entire lawn of Christmas decorations from the home of the Collins family in Saginaw, Texas, angering mother Kristine and devastating 6-year-old daughter Halliee.

But now, Kristine is getting her revenge, and all by taking the high road.

Payback: Mom Kristine then made a sign calling out the thief, and letting them know they broke her daughter Hallie's heart

Rather then redecorate or call the authorities, Kristine instead opted to put a sign in her yard calling out the thief - and she will be keeping it there the entire holiday season.

'I wanted the people to know that I know what they did,' Kristine toldMy Fox 28. 

'I don't want other people waking up and having their 5- or 6-year olds crying in tears over why their decorations were gone.'

Her sign calls out the thief for 'breaking a little girl's heart,' and ends by saying 'we will pray for you.'

Among the decorations stolen by the thief were numerous candy canes that lined the Collins' walkway, two spiral Christmas trees, and a light-up deer, all of which had been put outside on November 1 as is their family tradition.

But despite this setback, Kristine says the family's holiday spirit will live on.

And hopefully one Texas neighborhood will now be rid of that mean old Grinch.
