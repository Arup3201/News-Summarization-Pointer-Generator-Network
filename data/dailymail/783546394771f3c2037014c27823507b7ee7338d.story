The country’s biggest education authority has revived plans to open the first new grammar school in 50 years.

Kent County Council has asked Education Secretary Nicky Morgan to approve its plans to open a ‘satellite’ grammar school to meet demand from a rising population.

Earlier proposals submitted by the authority were rejected by her predecessor Michael Gove.

The plans emerged as London Mayor Boris Johnson described the decline of selection as a ‘tragedy’.

Kent’s proposals involve opening a grammar school in the town of Sevenoaks, which would operate as an ‘annexe’ to the existing Weald of Kent grammar nine miles away.

Mrs Morgan is expected to rule on the plans before the election, throwing the spotlight on the bitterly-contested issue of academic selection in schools.

Theresa May, the Home Secretary is already backing plans for a new grammar school annexe in her Maidstone constituency.

Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary and MP for Sevenoaks, has also supported the Kent school plan, saying it was ‘deeply unfair to parents in my constituency’ that the town did not have a grammar school.

It came as Mr Johnson added his voice to calls for an expansion of selection, telling LBC Radio: ‘I think they are a very important part of the mix in our educational system, I think that they work very well in many areas and they should be supported.

‘I think that the decision to get rid of them was a real tragedy for this country.’

Labour passed laws in 1998 banning the opening of any more grammars because of the party’s long-standing opposition to academic selection.

But the Coalition made it easier for the 163 remaining state grammar schools to open satellites to meet demand from parents for more places.

Kent’s original proposal was rejected last year because the annexe was considered too different from the ‘parent’ school.

It had planned to admit both boys and girls, despite being sponsored by a single-sex girls’ school.

Under the revised plan, the new school will only admit girls and will be more closely linked to its sponsor school.

Paul Carter, the council leader, said: ‘I am delighted that we now have a robust proposal to put to the Secretary of State for her sign-off.

‘School rolls are rising dramatically and we must be allowed to expand grammar schools in line with all other categories and types of school.

‘This is good news for parents with daughters and we will continue to work in earnest to find a solution for their sons.

‘I am also delighted by the support from Theresa May and Michael Fallon for the establishment of further grammar school provision in their constituencies.’

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘We want good schools to be able to expand but they have to do so within the law. Every application will have to be considered on its own merits.’
