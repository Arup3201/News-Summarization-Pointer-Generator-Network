With about three minutes left, Paris Saint-Germain’s social media guru was so confident the team would cruise to an easy 2-0 win they decided to poke some fun at Jose Mourinho.

The French champions may have been down to nine men after suffering four injuries — two after their last substitution had been made — but such was their superiority, there seemed zero chance of letting it slip. So, those following PSG’s Twitter account saw: ‘PSG forced to “Park the Bus” (shout out to Jose Mourinho!) in the final minutes.’

Oh how it backfired. Five minutes later, Caen had bounced off the ropes to earn a draw, PSG’s players were trudging off and Chelsea’s manager had the last laugh.

Four injuries, as Laurent Blanc admitted afterwards, are ‘hard to accept’.

As preparation for Tuesday night’s Champions League last-16 tie with Chelsea, it couldn’t have gone much worse.

Blanc sounded like a manager who had conceded defeat before a ball had been kicked.

He said: ‘If someone had told me this story, I would not have believed it. We will play bravely but there are not many solutions, with four or five injured. It’s an extraordinary challenge.’

The four definitely out of the Chelsea contest are Yohan Cabaye (adductor muscle), Marquinhos (thigh), Serge Aurier (quadriceps) and Lucas Moura (adductor).

The fifth player who Blanc alluded to is Blaise Matuidi, who is now rated 50-50 for the Chelsea game. PSG’s confidence will have taken a blow, too. They were coasting to the top of the table with minutes remaining after goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic (72 seconds in) and Ezequiel Lavezzi.

But after Aurier collapsed in a heap seconds after the final change had been made and Lucas hobbled off after receiving a knock, the nine men were pressed into a rearguard action.

They couldn’t hold out. A minute after the ‘Park the Bus’ jibe, Emiliano Sala pulled one back and Herve Bazile’s stunning free-kick sent the visitors into raptures.

‘It was a bizarre game,’ admitted PSG captain Thiago Silva. ‘I can’t understand what happened. We need to stay positive.’

Hamburg must dread their visits to Bayern Munich. A couple of years ago, Bayern caned them 9-2 and this time they lost 8-0! 

Thomas Muller, Arjen Robben and Mario Gotze all scored two, while Robert Lewandowski and Franck Ribery also netted. 

‘We lost a game, we shouldn’t mourn,’ said Hamburg coach Josef Zinnbauer.

But Chelsea should still be wary. Ibrahimovic was his usual self, scoring what can only be described as a ‘kung-fu kick’ goal after the telescopic extension of his leg to meet Aurier’s cross.

Zlatan then removed his shirt to reveal tattooed on his skin the names of 50 people the United Nations World Food Programme have helped.

Lavezzi was excellent, taking his goal well with a crisp low shot while Marco Verratti was metronomic with his passing.

Edinson Cavani, who has attracted interest from Manchester United, didn’t even get off the bench.

But if lowly Caen can expose weaknesses, you have to fancy Chelsea to get the job done.
