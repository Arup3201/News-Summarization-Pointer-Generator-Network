Europe's top leagues have stated their clearest opposition yet to changing the 2022 World Cup dates in Qatar.

The European Professional Football Leagues group says 'all scenarios on the rescheduling of the World Cup in Qatar are damaging the domestic competitions and leagues' business interests.'

Top-tier leagues face taking an eight-week mid-season break if the World Cup kicks off in November, as has been suggested by FIFA President Sepp Blatter.

The EPFL said after a board meeting on Thursday that it will give its view on moving the tournament from the hot summer months to a FIFA consultation process.

Blatter has set next March as the deadline to decide the tournament dates.

European leagues and clubs have long been expected to oppose a November-December World Cup.
