It has been four years since readers were last sucked into the mysterious world of Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon.

But he will reappear in May when Dan Brown releases his new novel, based on the hidden clues in medieval poet Dante’s Inferno.

His first book since The Lost Symbol in 2009 is named after Dante’s poem and will be set in Italy.

Its title was revealed on Mr Brown’s website in puzzle form.

Every time a Twitter user tweeted ‘#DanBrownTODAY’ a tiny piece of the puzzle appeared, until a mosaic was created spelling out ‘Inferno’.

Like The Da Vinci Code, which was based on theories about the secret history of the Mona Lisa, Inferno will examine the deeper meanings of Dante’s poem and its influence on modern life.

It is thought the author could inflame religious controversy – as he did with The Da Vinci Code when he suggested Jesus and Mary Magdelene had had children – by expanding on Dante’s criticism of church leaders.

‘Although I studied Dante’s Inferno as a student, it wasn’t until recently, while researching in Florence, that I came to appreciate the enduring influence of Dante’s work on the modern world,’ Mr Brown said.

Inferno (Italian for Hell) is the first part of Dante Alighieri's 14th-century epic poem The Divine Comedy. 

It is an allegory telling of the journey of Dante through Hell, guided by the Roman poet Virgil. 

In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine circles of suffering located within the Earth. 

The Divine Comedy represents the journey of the soul towards God, with the Inferno describing the recognition and rejection of sin.

‘With this new novel, I am excited to 
take readers on a journey deep into this mysterious realm…a landscape of
codes, symbols, and more than a few secret passageways.’

The author’s editor Jason Kaufman 
said: ‘When we turn the first page of a new Dan Brown novel, we step 
into a world that seamlessly infuses fascinating history, art, symbols 
and puzzles.

In Inferno, we have the added 
excitement of following Robert Langdon back to the heart of Europe, 
where he becomes entwined in a mystery that has global ramifications.’

Four million copies of Inferno will initially be published in the UK, the US and Canada on May 14.

The book will be the fourth in the 
series featuring protagonist Robert Langdon, which started with Angels 
and Demons in 2000, followed by The Da Vinci Code in 2003 and The Lost 
Symbol in 2009.

Mr Brown has sold more than 200million copies of his novels, including 80million copies of The Da Vinci Code.

The son of a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Brown was born in 1964 in Exeter, New Hampshire, and raised on a prep school campus where he developed a fascination with the paradoxical interplay between science and religion. 

These themes eventually formed the backdrop for his books.

He is a graduate of Amherst College, a private liberal arts college in Massachusetts, and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he later returned to teach English before focusing his attention full time to writing.

His novels, including The Da Vinci Code which has become one of the best selling novels of all time, is the subject of heated debate among readers and scholars. 

In 2005, he was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine, whose editors credited him with 'keeping the publishing industry afloat; renewed interest in Leonardo da Vinci and early Christian history; spiking tourism to Paris and Rome; a growing membership in secret societies; the ire of Cardinals in Rome; eight books denying the claims of the novel and seven guides to read along with it; a flood of historical thrillers; and a major motion picture franchise.'
