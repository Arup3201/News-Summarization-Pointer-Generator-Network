When a hungry mother-of-two bit into a tasty chicken, bacon and lettuce sandwich from Tesco, she got a mouthful she wasn't expecting.

Katie Crabtree was shocked to discover a hairy creature that appeared to be a rodent inside the pre-packaged snack she had bought from a branch of the supermarket chain in Stockport.

The horrified 31-year-old only spotted the ‘furry object’ after swallowing part of it - thinking it was a piece of burnt bacon.

Horrified: Ms Crabtree (pictured) only spotted the animal - thought to be a rodent - after swallowing a piece of it, thinking it was just burnt bacon

She said: 'I took a bite and saw this big black thing in it - but I thought it was just burnt bacon and swallowed it.

'Then I saw there was something horrible in the sandwich.

'It was black and had hair - and I could see a little paw. It was horrendous.'

Ms Crabtree said the shocking discovery made her feel sick.

'I can’t eat another packaged sandwich because I just think of that horrible thing,' she said.

She accused the supermarket giant of 
trying to ignore her after she followed up her initial complaint with 
the store and head office.

'I chased it up a few 
times with the store and head office but nobody seemed to know what was 
happening,' she said.

'In the end they gave me a £10 voucher.

'I think they’ve fobbed me off. They 
need to find out what happened to this sandwich in case something needs 
to be done where it was made.'

Complaint: Ms Crabtree claims Tesco tried to 'fob her off' after she complained about the grizzly discovery. The supermarket chain has apologised and sent her a £10 voucher

Tesco sent her an apology letter and said it would investigate, as well as offering her £10 in compensation.

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We take any case of this kind very seriously.

'Sadly, on this occasion, our food safety procedures didn’t work as they should have done.

'We have apologised to our customer and are urgently investigating the matter with our supplier.

Snack: A Peruvian women takes a bite from a roasted Guinea Pig

Guinea pigs are popular snacks in Peru.

The rodents are killed, stripped of their fur, and roasted on a spit - in scenes that would be sure to horrify many Western pet owners.

Once the animals have been cooked to a crisp, street vendors arrange them into various poses - decorating them with strips of vegetables to make it look like they have tongues and eyeballs.

Guinea pig has been an important dish in the Andes highlands for thousands of years, and is a dish eaten in many South American countries.

In Cusco, Peru, a common guinea pig dish is called chiriuchu.

The name means 'cold food' in quechua, the language of the Incas, and it centres on guinea pig (known locally as 'cuy'), and also includes a portion of chicken, dried salt-beef, blood sausage, sea-weed, toasted maize, cheese, fish eggs, hot pepper and a potato and herb tortilla.

Chiriuchu is typically eaten at local festivals, especially during Corpus Christi, where it is available from street-side stands.

The dish is so popular, locals have even appealed to UNESCO for it to be declared part of the Cusqueñan cultural heritage.
