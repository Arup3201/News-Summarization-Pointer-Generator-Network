Police in Washington D.C. say they found no dangerous materials at the National Air and Space Museum after a suspicious briefcase was found near an unconscious person in one of the galleries.

All streets were reopened earlier this afternoon and the building is once again open to visitors.

Smithsonian spokeswoman Becky Haberacker says all visitors and staff were evacuated onto the National Mall about 12:45 p.m. Wednesday.

The building remained closed to the public until mid-afternoon.
