An unsuspecting Reddit user was left shaking when billionaire Bill Gates revealed he was her online secret Santa.

The lucky 25-year-old, known only by her username calid7, received a Marvel Comics supervillain helmet, a book and a giant poliovirus stuffed toy from the Microsoft founder, as part of the Redditgifts gift exchange.

'I can not believe it,' calid7 wrote. 'I am literally shaking right now I AM IN SHOCK (someone get me a blanket!).

This is not the first time Bill Gates  has been involved with the online present exchange

'The amazing human being Bill Gates sent me a Loki Helmet which I have been dying to own ever since the first Thor movie came out!!

'I also got an amazing coffee table book of gorgeous pictures of Africa (somewhere I desperately want to go, its on my bucket list!) with an inscription and a giant microbes polio virus stuffed animal!'

In the post uploaded on December 17, calid7, who loves 'just about everything to come out of the UK', said the horns were cracked but she is sure she can fix them.

A donation was also made in her name to Shot@Life - a project providing life-saving vaccines to children. 

She added: 'I can't even begin to describe how incredible it makes me feel knowing that he made this donation in my name!

"I always donate what I can for charities, which is never much cause money is always extremely tight, it really makes me glow!'

This is not the first time the world's richest person has been involved with the gift exchange, which began connecting internet strangers around the world in 2009.

Last year, 24-year-old Reddit user Rachel, who posts under the username NY1227, received a $40 travel book and a $25 stuffed cow, along with an undisclosed donation to the non-profit Heifer International. 

It seems calid7's cat was also pleased with the gifts. The Reddit user wrote: 'MY cat thanks Mr. Bill gates for the best christmas gift ever, a mountain of paper to play on! She absolutely loves it...'
