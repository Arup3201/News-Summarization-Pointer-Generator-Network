Three people have been arrested in Oklahoma after one was shot in the back during an alleged Bigfoot hunting quest in a case that has baffled police.

It all started on Saturday night when a man called 911 saying that he'd accidentally shot his friend.

The pair claimed to have been on a Sasquatch hunting expedition on the corner of 177th East Avenue and Tiger Switch Road in Rogers County.

One of the men, Omar Pineda, told police he flinched after hearing a 'barking noise' and accidentally shot his friend in the back.

'When you start off with an explanation like that do you believe anything after that?' Rogers County Sheriff Walton told Oklahoma's News 9.

Adding to the inconsistent stories, Pineda's wife, Lacey Jane Pineda, 22, told police that someone else had shot at her husband.

Proof? There is still debate over the existence of the Sasquatch and grainy photos such as this one are often dismissed as hoaxes. This latest story has done nothing to add any light on the existence of Bigfoot

Hardly hunting territory: The Bigfoot hunters claim to have been here, on the corner of 177th East Avenue and Tiger Switch Road, when they were searching for the Sasquatch, resulting in one being shot. Police do not believe their story

Police say that drugs and alcohol may been involved.

The men met emergency responders at a QuikTrip convenience store near Interstate 44 and 161st Street after the shooting.

Pineda, 21, was arrested for reckless conduct with a firearm and obstruction.

Deputies also arrested Perry Don James, Pineda's father-in-law.

James threw his son-in-law's gun in a pond on the property because he is a convicted felon and was afraid to have the gun on his property, the Sheriff said.

James, 53, was booked on complaints of felon in possession of a firearm and destruction of evidence.

Deputies arrested Lacey Jane Pineda as well for obstruction because of her account of events.

Believable? There is no shortness of images mocking up what Bigfoot might look like should he exist. The Sasquatch hunting craze was reignited recently after new 'evidence' was found. However the findings turned out to be bear hair

The shooting victim was not charged and is expected to survive.

Walton said they will continue to investigate the incident.

'It probably was an accidental shooting,' Walton said.

'Our efforts now are to locate the weapon that was used.'

Whether the group were hunting or not, the Bigfoot search craze was recently reignited after scientists claimed to have found evidence the creature exists.

However the 'evidence' turned out to be the hair of a rare species of bear.

That doesn't seem to have stopped avid hunters from continuing to try and find the elusive Yeti.Â
