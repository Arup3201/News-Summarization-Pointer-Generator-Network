A monument chronicling 124 years of England's footballing hurt by listing every defeat suffered by the team between 1874 and 1998 has sold at auction for a staggering £425,000.

Starting with a 2-1 defeat to Scotland, the magnificent granite sculpture charts more than a century of England's footballing failures, finishing with a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Romania in the 1998 World Cup.

The gloomy untitled piece was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan and was being auctioned by Sotherby's as part of their Bear Witness art sale, which has already generated £26.5 million. 

The granite sculpture details all of England's losses between 1874 and 1998

The piece, created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, has fetched an incredible £425,000 at Sotherby's

Among the most memorable defeats will be Diego Maradona's Hand of God goal at the 1986 World Cup

Space remains for a few more of England's more recent losses to be added

Mr Cattelan said: 'Carved into it are all the defeats of England's national football team. I guess it's a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death.'

Among the defeats etched into the enormous black structure is the infamous 2-1 loss to Argentina in 1986, immortalised by Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal, and the shock 1-0 to the USA in 1950.

It was first exhibited in 1999 and its sale comes in the wake of one of England's worst performance at an international tournament in recent memory, after they crashed out of the 2014 World Cup without a single win.

Mr Cattelan is known for his satirical art pieces and is the mastermind behind other works such as a sculpture depicting Pope John Paul II being hit by a meteorite. 

Defeat by Germany after Gareth Southgate's penalty miss at Euro 96 is a late entry on the list

Fortunately for England's current stars, their disastrous World Cup campaign came too late to make the list
