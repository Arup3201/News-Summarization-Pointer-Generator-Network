A convicted murderer had his trial thrown out of court today  after he spoke of a letter alleging a sexual relationship with the assistant district attorney.

Danny Hembree, 50, was on trial for the second of three murders he is suspected of having committed.

Hembree was sentenced to death on 
November 18 last year for the 2009 murder of Heather Catterton, 17, and has been held at 
Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Eruption: Shellie Nations, Randi Saldana's sister, screamed 'You killed my sister' at Danny Hembree who is on trial for her murder in Gaston County, North Carolina

He was back in court today accused of the murder of Randi Dean Saldana, 30, who was also murdered in 2009. 

During the murder trial for Miss Catterton, Hembree said he had strangled 
Saldana in the basement of his mother’s Gastonia, North Carolina home, but that it was 
an accident after a marathon of sex and crack cocaine.

Miss Saldana's burnt remains were found lying in a dirt road in Kings Mountain State Park. Hembree is also believed to have killed Deborah Ratchford, 30, whose body found in 1992.

During a police interrogation, Hembree admitted to killing two other women, though he now says that he was 
lying to distract authorities and cover up other crimes.

Sickening: At the end of his first murder trial in November, over the killing of 17-year-old Heather Catterton, Hembree blew a kiss to the courtroom

The court proceedings ended in disarray today after the prosecution questioned the Death Row inmate about a letter he wrote.

According to Wscotv.com,
Hembree said: 'What I am wondering about is are you going to show the 
letter about the sexual relationship between me and (Assistant District 
Attorney) Stephanie (Hamlin) that the attorney general sent in here the 
other day?'

He claimed that Ms Hamlin was biased against him because he left her for Heather Catterton's sister. ADA Hamlin said the story is a lie.

However Hembree’s defense attorneys withdrew after the allegations today and the judge declared a mistrial - to which the prosecution objected.

Hembree then objected saying he was having problems with his attorneys.

According the TV station, Miss Saldana's sister Shellie Nations then screamed out across the court room: 'Well I object to you killing my sister!'

She was removed from the room by officers.

Earlier this year, Hembree sent a letter to a 
local North Carolina newspaper boasting about his 'life of leisure' 
behind bars.

Taunting his Miss Catterton's family, 
Hembree wrote: 'Is the public aware that the chances of my lawful murder
taking place in the next 20 years if ever are very slim?

'Is the public aware that I am a 
gentleman of leisure, watching color TV in the a/c, reading, taking naps
at will, eating three well-balanced meals a day?

'I
am a man who is ready to except [sic] his unjust punishment and face 
God Almighty with a clear conscience unlike you cowards and your 
cowardly system.

'Kill me if you can, suckers. Ha! Ha! Ha!' he wrote to the Gazette.

He was found guilty of killing
the 17-year-old girl  - a crime both his sister and son do not 
believe he committed.

'I got a call from the father of the 17-year-old that he murdered, in tears,' District Attorney Locke Bell said at the time. 

'He said that this is tearing the family to shreds. This is ripping the wound open.

'(The father) said, "He murdered our daughter, got the death penalty and now he's just sitting in jail laughing at us!"'
