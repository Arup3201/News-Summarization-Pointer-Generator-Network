Missing: Dylan Redwine vanished the Monday before Thanksgiving while he was spending the day with his father Mark in Vallecito

The mother of the Colorado teen that has been missing for a week, says she suspects her ex-husband could be involved in the boy's disappearance.

Dylan Redwine, 13, vanished the Monday before Thanksgiving while he was spending the day with his father Mark in Vallecito, during a court ordered visit.

But his mother, Elaine Redwine, says she fears her ex-husband could have done something to drastic, as they argued over custody of the boy.

'I was married to Mark for a lot of years, and I know the way he reacts to things,' she told ABC News.

'If Dylan maybe did or said something that wasn't what Mark wanted to hear, I'm just afraid of how Mark would have reacted,' she added.

The couple are divorced and and the mother believes her husband was angry that she was appointed the boy's primary custodian.

'I don't think Mark treats him very well,' Elaine Redwine said.

'I would not put it past Mark to have done something to remove Dylan from the situation. You know, like 'if I can't have him, nobody will."'

Scuba divers have now been enlisted to search for the missing 13-year-old boy who disappeared during a court-ordered visit with his father.

The biggest break in the case came when police dogs traced the boy’s scent to the edge of Vallecito Lake, but the scuba teams failed to find any further clues during their search on Sunday.

They will continue through Monday using boats equipped with sonar tools that will help scan the depths of the lake.

Dylan lives full-time in Colorado Springs with his mother and brothers but was in Vallecito to spend time with his father at the time of his disappearance.

His mother Elaine says Dylan was unhappy about having to make the trip, but that he would not have run away from home.

'Dylan
wouldn't have left willingly,' Elaine Redwine said on Friday during an 
interview at the home of a friend. 'If there was any way to communicate 
he would have called.'

The 
boy's father Mark Redwine told investigators he last saw his son on 
Monday morning around 7.30am before leaving the home to run errands.

He said his son was gone when he returned four hours later.

A
neighbor who knows Dylan told police he saw the boy walking along a 
road in Vallecito the afternoon he went missing but thought nothing of 
it until hearing the police reports.

In addition to the scuba team checking the lake, police are still pursuing other options, including a scenario where Dylan ran away from home with the help of a friend.

Local station KMGH reports that a postal worker saw a boy matching Dylan’s description walking in Vallecita with another boy about his age.

His childhood friends from Bayfield, which is just over 20 miles from the area where Dylan's father lives, suggested an alternative theory that police are also looking into. They believe that Dylan may have tried hitchhiking to go see them in his old hometown, during which he was abducted.

Police say they haven't ruled out foul play.

'We know some people are upset that we are even considering the possibility that Dylan may have run away. But we are working for Dylan and we owe it to him and to his family to consider every possible scenario that could have caused him to drop out of sight for a week,’ Dan Bender, La Plata Sheriff's office spokesman told KMGH.

The missing boy is 5 feet tall, weighing 105 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and fair complexion. He was last seen wearing a blue-and-white Duke Blue Devils baseball cap, black Nike T-shirt and black Jordan tennis shoes.

Dylan was picked up Sunday by his father at Durango-La Plata County Airport, his mother said on Friday. Dylan announced his arrival in a text message and ended it with an emoticon expressing a scowl, she said.

‘I don't know if you can see this and I know you're not a big reader, so I will keep this short. We are all in Durango looking for you. I AM HERE and I will never give up looking for you. You are my ray of sunshine and the best kid a mother could ever have,’ she wrote in a Facebook post.

Mrs Redwine added that the boy's father rarely exercises his right to see his own son, and she added that it would be out of character for Dylan to suddenly want to take a walk in the woods.

'Dylan is a generational kid and tech savvy,' she said. 'He wouldn't have gone to the mountains to pitch a tent or build a fire.'

Mr Bender said that the search expanded on Saturday morning to include Bayfield, a town south of Vallecito.

‘I think that anyone who has a child can understand how devastated the family is,’ said La Plata sheriff Duke Schirard.

‘There's always hope until facts prove otherwise,’ he told the station.
