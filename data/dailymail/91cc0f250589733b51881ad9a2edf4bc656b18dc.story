The World Cup is the trophy that everybody footballer dreams of cradling in their arms.

And even Jamaican sprint star Usain Bolt by the looks of it.

Bolt, an avid Manchester United fan, posted a picture on his Instagram of him holding a replica of the famous trophy, with the message: ‘Since I have the World Cup all wrapped up safe in my arms...I wonder which lucky country I will give it to?hmmmmm #WorldCupFever #WhoWillWin #LuckyMe.’

Earlier this year the 27-year-old refused to rule out a sensational call-up to Jamaica's national football team after posting an image of a newspaper story on Instagram.

Reacting to a story in The Jamaica Star, which claims he is ready to accept manager Winfried Schafer's offer of a place in his World Cup 2018 qualifying squad, Bolt took a picture of the page and uploaded it with the message: 'Jamaica how we look? Hmmm..A we say to the world and anything possible.. #SeriousFace #ReggaeBoyz #ForeverFaster #FutureOption #MadTalent #AnythingPossible'.

Bolt has previously spoken of his desire to play for Manchester United.

The sprinter once begged Sir Alex Ferguson for a trial with Premier League champions United.

He said: ‘I know I could make a difference. I’d be the fastest in the team - but I can play as well.

'If Ferguson called me up and said, "OK let’s do this, come and have a trial", it would be impossible for me to say no.'
