Letters exchanged between Hewitt, then General Secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties, and Keith Hose, the chairman of PIE were discovered

Further evidence of the link between a civil liberties organisation and a child sex lobbying group emerged last night, as letters between Patricia Hewitt and the Paedophile Information Exchange were discovered.

The letters between former Cabinet health minister Hewitt, then General Secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties, and Keith Hose, the chairman of PIE were discovered in an archive at Hull University.

In December 1975, Hose wrote to Hewitt asking her to consider PIE's views in its policy on the age of consent, which included decriminalising sex with children as young as four.

His letter was written on PIE notepaper and the letterhead featured a logo of two barelegged children sitting on a rock.

The letter from the PIE chairman said: 'As a member of the NCCL Gay Rights Sub-Committee it has come to my notice that the next meeting of the NCCL Executive Committee is to consider NCCL policy in relation to "Ages of Consent" for sexual activity.  

'Paedophile Information Exchange has produced some evidence for the Criminal Law Revision Committee on this subject and I have enclosed two copies with this letter in the hope that the ideas contained in our evidence might help the NCCL Executive Committee reach a decision.'

Hewitt responded to Mr Hose, in a typed letter on yellow paper seen by The Guardian: 'Thank you for your letter of 16th December. My apologies for the delay in acknowledging. 

'We have found your evidence... most helpful and I think it has certainly been taken into account by the people preparing our evidence.'

The archive includes a NCCL briefing note that argues that child pornography should not be outlawed in the 1978 child protection bill, the Guardian reported.

It also records how Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman, who started at NCCL in 1978, personally urged changes to the bill that year telling MPs 'images of children should only be considered pornographic if it could be proven the subject suffered'.

Miss Harman she said the paedophile group 'had been pushed to the margin' before she began working there

The exchange of letters comes after the Mail can reveal that in 1979, an edition of Magpie, PIE’s official journal, carried the NCCL appeal for new members in an appalling ‘Year of the Child’ edition.

The Mail can also reveal that former health minister and NCCL general secretary Patricia Hewitt shared a conference platform with PIE leader Tom O’Carroll in 1977.

Ms Harman and her MP husband Jack Dromey say PIE was banished before she became the NCCL’s legal officer in 1978.

But disturbing new evidence contradicts this claim – and reveals further embarrassingly close ties between the NCCL and the paedophile group campaigning to legalise sex with children.

Miss Harman she said the paedophile group ‘had been pushed to the margin’ before she began working there.

Yet, during the year after she took up her post, the NCCL advert appeared in PIE’s April journal.It ran inside a shocking 24-page special edition of the magazine – the cover of which shows a picture of a young boy wearing only a small pair of shorts as he plays tennis.

It invites Magpie readers to ‘join the NCCL’ and boasts that the organisation is ‘working to protect and extend human rights in the UK’.

The appeal for new members and donations was published after a feature titled: Child porn, a heterosexual viewpoint.

Earlier this week Miss Harman  belatedly expressed ‘regret’ – but refused to apologise – for PIE being allowed to forge links with the NCCL

Details of the new links came as O’Carroll claimed the two women ‘didn’t even try’ to remove the paedophile group from the NCCL in case it harmed their careers.

The three senior Labour figures all held 
key roles in the council – which astonishingly granted ‘affiliate’ 
status to the group of predatory paedophiles that was calling for the 
age of consent to be cut to just four.
