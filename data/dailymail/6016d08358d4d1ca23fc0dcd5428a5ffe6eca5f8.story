It is the new Nordic-style drama that has everyone gripped.

Dubbed the 'Broadchurch of the Arctic,' the much-anticipated Sky Atlantic series Fortitude tells the tale of a close-knit community that has never previously experienced a violent crime, dealing with a grisly and mysterious murder.

With Arctic Norway providing the spectacular setting for the programme, tourism bosses are expecting a surge in visitors seeking out the icy perfection featured in the show. 

Fortitude, Sky Atlantic's gripping new drama, was inspired by the real-life Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard

Fortitude, which stars Michael Gambon and Stanley Tucci, premiered on January 29 to great fanfare after being dubbed the 'Broadchurch of the Arctic'

In the winter, temperatures in the breathtaking archipelago can reach as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius

The Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard takes centre stage in the show, with travel companies jumping on the opportunity to offer fans unique ways to explore the dramatic landscape.

Dogsledding and learning to mush your own husky team are among the outbound activities that make Svalbard a key adventure destination, along with snowmobile safaris or even hiking and kayaking in the summer months.

Along with adventure tourism company, Basecamp Explorer, guests can experience the unspoiled grandeur

During a week-long trip in March - to see the solar eclipse - travellers will stay at the Basecamp Trappers Hotel (pictured)

Situated in Longyearbyen, the hotel is made of drift wood, tar paper and other recycled materials

The Basecamp Trapper's Hotel, situated at the heart of Longyearbyen, the largest settlement in Svalbard, is made of drift wood, tar paper and other recycled materials, is Spitsbergen's first lodge.

Set up in 1998, it's since expanded to five eco-lodges and 16 individually decorated rooms, that offer a perfect starting point for arctic adventures that are mindful of ecological principles.

There, guests can witness the Northern Lights - through the hotel's glass ceiling - and explore abandoned mining towns.

Travellers will also have the opportunity to spend four nights at Spitsbergen's Ship in the Ice, the world's only ice-bound hotel.

The 100-year-old schooner, Nooderlicht, is frozen in the Tempelfjorden each year.

Located 60km northeast of Longyearbyen, it's accessible only by snowmobile or dog sled from mid-February to mid-May, dependent on ice conditions.

Travellers can also stay at Spitsbergen's Ship in the Ice - the world's only ice-bound hotel

On the day of eclipse, March 20, guests will observe the phenomenon before taking to the snow for an active afternoon of seal and polar bear-spotting

Ship in the Ice has 10 well-equipped cabins with a total of 20 beds, as well as lounges, a fully-licensed bar and a well-appointed restaurant. 

On the day of the eclipse itself, March 20, guests will observe the incredible phenomenon, followed by a lunch with sparkling wine and an afternoon spent seal and polar bear-spotting. 

That evening, a festive four-course dinner will also be served - but don't worry, though the breathtaking Norwegian archipelago can see winters as cold as minus 30 Celsius, this meal will take place indoors.
