A seven-year-old is recovering after suffering from a very rare form of childhood ovarian cancer.

Niamh Brown was diagnosed with the cancer, which affects just a handful of youngsters in the UK, earlier this year.

She underwent surgery to remove the tumour at Manchester Children’s Hospital and also lost one of her ovaries, but after gruelling chemotherapy she is now thought to be on the mend.

Niamh Brown was diagnosed with a rare childhood form of ovarian cancer at the age of seven

Her mother, Julia, said: ‘She was diagnosed at the beginning of the summer holidays after she started showing signs of early puberty.

These are tumours which develop from the granulosa cells, normally in the ovaries, and are malignant.

In boys, they can occur in the testes but this is extremely rare.

Granulosa cells' major function is the production of sex hormones, such as FSH.

The most common symptom in girls is the early onset of puberty.

The prognosis tends to be good, especially if the cancer is caught early.

‘The first thing I noticed were her mood swings, she turned into a teenager overnight.

‘The tumour they found was the size of an orange.

'I was told when it's in your stomach, your bowels move around so it can be masked.

‘But she was lucky it protruded, it looked like a pot belly and the GP was soon on the ball.’

Niamh had a rare juvenile granulosa cell tumour.

These tumours, which develop from the granulosa cells, normally occur in the ovaries, as in Niamh's case, and are malignant.

Granulosa cells' major function is the production of sex hormones.

The most common symptom in children is the early onset of puberty.

The prognosis tends to be good, especially if the cancer is caught early.

Niamh, who lives in Hyde, Tameside, with Julia, her father Darrell, and siblings Matthew, 10, and Martha Rose, eight-months, battled bravely through her treatment and only got upset over one thing.

‘The only thing she cried about was missing gymnastics. It's everything to her, she just adores it,’ said Mrs Brown, 36.

Niamh (pictured with her father, Darrell) is now recovering and her prognosis is thought to be good. Her parents have been told she should still be able to have children when she is older

She is still unable to join in gymnastics but instead devotes her time to helping cancer charities.

She was recently guest of honour at a charity event organised by Tameside Gymnastics Club which raised more than £900.

Mr Brown, 28, a chauffeur, said: ‘She's not been fazed by the cancer at all. 
She's such a bubbly girl - always laughing and smiling. She's a little 
soldier.’

Niamh’s 
prognosis is now good and her parents have been told the illness should 
not affect her ability to have children when she is older.
