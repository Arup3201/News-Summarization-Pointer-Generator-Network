'Sheer greed': John Mulholland, is published widely in academic journals, billed the NHS for work that was never done

A leading heart expert’s career is in tatters after he was convicted of a million pound fraud against an NHS trust.

John Mulholland, who has an international reputation and is published widely in academic journals, billed the NHS for work that was never done.

He and several colleagues were employed by Basildon Hospital in Essex, which they jokingly referred to as ‘Bas Vegas’ – a reference to the gambling resort of Las Vegas.

But while they were being paid full-time salaries, they were moonlighting at other NHS trusts.

Over four years, the fraudsters were overpaid by about £420,000. Private work they did at other hospitals netted a further £700,000.

The court heard how the defendants reminded each other in emails about doing ‘face shows’ – turning up to work from time to time to stop other staff becoming suspicious about their whereabouts.

They worked as clinical perfusionists – specialists who operate heart and lung machines during procedures including cardiac surgery. Opening the case in May, prosecutor Shaun Collery told jurors: ‘This is in many respects a sad case.

‘It involves one of the perfusion medical teams at Basildon Hospital engaging in a fraud.

‘They provided significant services to the public and were rewarded by a salary but it was not enough. They started to earn more by doing less and engaging in activities which stole from their employer, the public purse and from you.’

Basildon Crown Court heard Mulholland, 41, Ann Clements, 51, and Martin Oliver, 37, all of east London, and Tom Cumberland, 42, of Penge, south-east London, were directors of a private company they set up called London Perfusion Science Ltd (LPS).

Each was contracted to work up to 37.5 hours a week for Basildon and Thurrock University NHS Foundation Trust. But between February 2007 and November 2011 they were paid for 14,000 hours they did not work – 45 per cent of the time they claimed for.

Instead, they were boosting their incomes at other hospitals.

Mulholland, who graduated from Edinburgh University and was chief perfusion scientist at Hammersmith Hospital in west London, submitted false time sheets.

Probe: Police were called in by the health service’s fraud investigation department after the fraudsters movements were tracked electronically

When bosses became suspicious they tracked the colleagues’ movements through an electronic security system, which monitors staff entry to the car park and building.

Police were then called in by the health service’s fraud investigation department.

Six people were subsequently charged with conspiracy to defraud. All denied the offence and two non-directors of LPS were acquitted.

The four found guilty on Wednesday will be sentenced next month and face up to ten years in jail.

None is employed by Basildon Hospital currently.

Speaking after the convictions, Crown Prosecution Service deputy head of fraud Andrew Penhale said: ‘Unlike other private health work, which is legitimately undertaken by senior health professionals with the full knowledge of the NHS, this was fraud, pure and simple.

‘These defendants held respected roles in their profession and exploited the trust and responsibility given to them to dishonestly make money through sheer greed.’

Basildon and Thurrock Trust said the group had ‘cheated the NHS out of scarce resources’.

It added: ‘We have now introduced strict controls to try to prevent such fraud occurring again.’
