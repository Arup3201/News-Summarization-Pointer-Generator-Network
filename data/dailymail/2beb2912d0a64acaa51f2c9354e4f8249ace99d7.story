A self-styled adventurer is to spend a year living on a melting iceberg off the coast of Greenland to try to draw attention to climate change.

In spring next year Alex Bellini, 36, will find a suitable iceberg off the north west of Greenland where he will remain until it melts.

He hopes his stunt will raise awareness of the impact of global warming, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently warned is 'widespread and consequential'.

Predictions by the World Resources Institute, based on IPCC data, suggest even in a best-case scenario that 24 per cent more of the global population will face shortages of renewable water by the 2080s compared to the 1980s.

Mr Bellini, who is from northern Italy but is based in the UK, has already run more than 14,000 miles worth of marathons, and rowed solo across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

But his one-man global warming campaign could be his most-difficult yet.

He will live in a Kevlar-reinforced survival capsule provisioned with 661lbs of dried food. He will be mostly alone, but for periods of the year hopes to invite writers and broadcasters to stay to raise awareness.

His equipment will be powered by a rowing machine-powered generator, which will allow him to keep in touch with the outside world without contributing to global warming himself.

When the iceberg becomes too dangerous to remain on, he will cast off into the ocean, drifting aboard his capsule until he is rescued.

He told Motherboard: 'My objective is reporting and investigating, by means of scientific methods, the entire lifetime of an iceberg. I want to prove how the pace of ice-melting has dramatically accelerated over the last decades.

'We’ll also play the symbolic card: the adventure of a man floating adrift on an iceberg will come to represent the condition of the whole humankind going adrift on an endangered planet.'

Mr Bellini says his goal is to encourage others to take action as well. In a YouTube video where he outlines his plans he says: 'On the iceberg, I will be generally alone, but for short periods of time I will be meeting with writers, bloggers, environmentalists…

'I dream that this will become the era of responsibility, where each of us can take on his version of responsibility to try to reverse this trend.'

But he said that his aim is not to be labelled as a new kind of environmentalist, telling Adventure Journal: 'I am and will always be an explorer.

'In this new mission I wish to become the bridge between the researchers and the rest of the world, and I hope I will help all those who will follow the adventure understanding the urgent need for action and for a greater sense of responsibility.'

Most of the time he will be alone, but he will sometimes be joined by writers
