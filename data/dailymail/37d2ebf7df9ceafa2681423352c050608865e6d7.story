The basketball rivalry between these Kentucky schools is so intense, even the mascots were duking it out on the court.

The mascots from Louisville Male High School and duPont Manual High School were supposed to pretend to fight at halftime, but the staged bout turned into a no-holds-barred grudge match as the crowd cheered them on.

It began with the Male Bulldog charging across the court at the Manual Ram, who reacted by trying to strike the bulldog with a two-legged drop kick.

The kick may have landed, but it wouldn't knock the bulldog down, and the mascots began trading punches and trying to wrestle each other to the ground.

The oversized animals eventually knocked each other down and were rolling around on the court before the scuffle is broken up.

Although a bulldog and a ram do not normally encounter each other in nature, the rivalry between Male and Manual has gone back more than a hundred years, as both schools were established before 1900.

The game eventually resumed, and Male came away with the victory over Manual 63-45.

A video clip of the fight made its way to YouTube by Friday night, which has just under 5,000 views - and counting.

In the video comments, there was a snippet of the rivalry, and both sides of the coin accused each other of a lack of class.

WDRB reported that even though the fight was broken up at center court, tensions between the two schools boiled over in a brawl outside after the game, resulting in several suspensions.

The fight went on for a good 20 seconds before an adult broke up the mascots as they rolled around on the court
