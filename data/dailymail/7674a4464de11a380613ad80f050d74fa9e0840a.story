AÂ  thug who beat his ex-girlfriend and mother of their daughter to death with a dumbbell is facing life behind bars after being found guilty of her murder.

Jack Wall, 22, attacked pretty hairdresser 19-year-old Amelia Arnold in a fit of anger, hitting her with a dumbbell eight times.

He then dumped her body in a nearby wood, popular with local families and dog walkers.

The body of Miss Arnold, who was described by her parents as a 'fantastic mum', was not discovered until four days later, close to the home they shared in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.

After dumping her body in woods in Travellers Lane, Hatfield, Wall disappeared.

Wall flew in to a rage during a row on November 8 after their relationship had broken down.

A post-mortem examination carried out on the victim revealed Miss Arnold died as a result of head injuries.

But he later handed himself in following an appeal by Hertfordshire Police, and was charged with her murder.

He denied the charge, instead admitting the lesser crime of manslaugher, and during his trial attempted to argue he had not intended to kill his former lover.

But a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court, London, convicted him on Friday and he now faces life behind bars.

Clues: Police set up a cordon at Miss Arnold's house to find evidence, but did not discover her body until four days after she disappeared

Following the verdict, detective 
inspector John Arthur, from Hertfordshire Police, said: 'Amelia had been
the victim of physical and mental abuse. She was controlled by Jack Wall, who was a bully.

'He cruelly and brutally took Amelia's life leaving their daughter without a mum.'

Mr Arthur paid tribute to Miss 
Arnold's family, adding: 'Not only have they tragically lost Amelia, 
Jack Wall has put them through the harrowing ordeal of having to listen 
to evidence in court, which they did with great dignity.

'We understand it can be extremely 
difficult for victims to seek help, but I would like to reassure anyone 
suffering this form of abuse that cases are dealt with sensitively and 
robustly by police and would urge victims to come forward to report any 
incidents.'

Disappearance: The teenager from Stevenage was missing for four days before police discovered her body in a wood

Miss Arnold's family paid tribute to 
her at the time, describing her as a 'fantastic mummy' who 'touched a 
lot of hearts in her lifetime.'

Another man, Joseph Potter, 41, from 
Sycamore Avenue in Bletchley, earlier pleaded guilty to assisting an 
offender and obstructing a coroner.

Both men are due to be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court tomorrow.
