A 90-year-old woman who shattered her pelvis in a fall was forced to wait six hours for an ambulance to take her to hospital. 

Barbara Hedley, who lives alone, was found lying face down by her neighbour crying in agony. 

After the alarm was raised at 5.45pm on August 29, guidelines stipulate an ambulance should have taken Mrs Hedley to hospital within 90 minutes.

But the widow, who said she feels she was treated like a 'dog', did not arrive at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital until after midnight.

Barbara Hedley, 90, from Beeston Regis, near Sheringham in north Norfolk, was left in agony waiting for an ambulance for six hours after falling at her home and shattering her pelvis 

Mrs Hedley, of Beeston Regis, near Sheringham in north Norfolk, said: 'I took a very dim view of all this having been in the trade for many years and to be treated like I wished I was dead.

'I don't think you would have treated a dog like that.'

The former ward sister at Mundesley Hospital, Norfolk, added: 'I have never suffered so much pain in my life.

'I will never forget it.'

Her neighbour Gina Mackenzie, 68, rushed to help after the 90-year-old pressed an emergency help-line button.

But it was more than two hours before a rapid response paramedic arrived and more than six before Mrs Hedley was taken to ambulance by a crew.

Mrs Mackenzie said she repeatedly called to find out if an ambulance had been sent.

A paramedic finally turned up after 8pm in a rapid response vehicle.

'The paramedic told us that if an ambulance had not arrived by 11pm we should phone 999,' said Mrs Mackenzie.

But with no ambulance she rang again at 11.15pm.

'Again it was confirmed that an ambulance was on its way coming from a very long way away but without blue lights,' said Mrs Mackenzie.

It was 12.15am before an ambulance arrived, by which time Mrs Hedley had been lifted into her bed.

Mrs Hedley added: 'I never want to go through that again.

'I couldn't move because of the pain in my leg and I knew I had fractured it.'

The former nurse said she feels she was treated like a 'dog'. She said: 'I never want to go through that again. I couldn't move because of the pain in my leg'

Norwich-born Mrs Hedley trained at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital before starting her career as a nurse in 1948.

She moved into her current home in 1980, her husband Walter died four years later and she has lived by herself ever since.

'One of the biggest fears I have is falling over,' said Mrs Hedley.

An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said Mrs Hedley had been conscious and breathing so the incident was graded as a 'green call' as it was not life-threatening.

Di Chan, senior locality manager for the ambulance service, said: 'I'd like to apologise to the patient for waiting as long as she did to be taken to hospital.

'A paramedic attended her two hours after the call but an ambulance crew was not available to visit her until much later.

'I am heartened that she was pleased with the level of care given when we attended.

'We are looking at this patient's case and will visit her to discuss what happened.

'We're working hard to get more ambulances on the road, recruit hundreds of new frontline staff, upskill staff, and save money to reinvest and improve patient care so that patients get a quicker response and a level of service they expect.'

Health Minister and North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb said: 'The impression I get is there has been a reduction in the horror stories, but this case demonstrates there is still a long way to go.

'There are still failings, which are unacceptable and I think renewing the ambulance fleet and recruiting hundreds of student paramedics will bear fruit.

'But it will take time.'

Between April and August this year, there were 164 instances in north Norfolk where response times to non-life-threatening patients were breached.

This was just under 4 per cent of all calls.

Ambulance services across the UK categorise each call according to how serious the patient's condition is.

The aim is to ensure the most serious, life-threatening calls are dealt with first.

The categories are nationally agreed, by the Department of Health and each ambulance service across the UK are measured according to required targets.

- Red 1

The most serious category, Red 1 is reserved for those patients who have suffered traumatic life-threatening injuries or those who are displaying the signs of suffering a heart attack or cardiac arrest.

An ambulance is expected to reach a patient within eight minutes.

Where possible two ambulance crews are dispatched to Red 1 calls - commonly a rapid response car, who can make initial assessments and start to treat the patient at the scene, followed by an ambulance, who can transport the patient to hospital.

Ambulance services across the UK categorise each 999 call according to how serious the patient's condition is. The aim is to ensure the most life-threatening calls are dealt with first

- Red 2

The second most serious category is for all other life-threatening emergencies. Examples include patients who have suffered a stroke, with serious symptoms or those who are struggling to breathe.

Similarly to Red 1 ambulance crews are expected to reach the patient within eight minutes of the 999 call being logged.

For both Red calls the response times are set out as national requirements rather than recommended times.

The guidelines dictate that an emergency response - usually in the form of a rapid response car - will reach 75 per cent of these calls within eight minutes.

Where onward transport to hospital is required, 95 per cent of life-threatening calls will receive an ambulance capable of transporting the patient within 19 minutes of the request being made.

- Green 1

These are serious but not life-threatening calls, for example diabetic problems or a suspected stroke with no serious symptoms.

A Green 1 call requires an emergency response within 20 minutes.

- Green 2

Also deemed serious but not life-threatening, Green 2 calls can include suspected fractured arms or legs, or a patient who has fallen and maybe immobile.

These calls require an emergency crew to be on the scene within 30 minutes.

- Green 3

These are non-emergency calls which require an on-scene response within 60 minutes or an assessment over the phone from the clinical support desk within 20 minutes. A patient who has suffered a suspected overdose, but is showing no serious symptoms, or someone who has suffered a non serious injury would be classified as a Green 3 call.

- Green 4

These are the least serious calls, which require emergency crews to be sent to the scene within 90 minutes or a telephone assessment within an hour.

Minor scalding, a fall with no apparent injuries or someone in pain, but showing no serious symptoms would be classed as a Green 4 999 call.

Response times for Green calls are recommended and are set locally rather than being national requirements.
