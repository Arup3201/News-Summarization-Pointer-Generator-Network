The UK is heading towards a triple dip recession with the bad weather threatening to tip the economy over the edge, a leading forecaster warned last night.

Official growth figures due on Friday are expected to show the British economy shrank in the final quarter of last year.

Many experts predict there will be another fall in the three months from January to March, plunging the nation into its third recession in five years.

The UK is heading towards a triple dip recession with the bad weather threatening to tip the economy over the edge,it has today been warned

‘We are sliding towards a triple dip recession in my view,’ said Peter Spencer, the chief economic adviser to the influential Ernst & Young Item Club, that uses the Treasury’s own models in its forecasting.

‘The snow is not helping. When the economy is bouncing along the bottom anyway, a bout of bad weather can easily tip it into negative territory,’ he added.

Snowfall over much of the country is likely to hurt the economy because wintry weather deters shoppers from heading to the High Street and also affects internet shopping because deliveries can be delayed, Spencer said.

But the worst impact is on construction and on supply chains, where companies find it hard to make up for lost ground.

‘If supply chains are hit and production lines disrupted, then it can have awesome effects,’ he said.

‘Then you have costs to business of people not getting into work due to transport problems or illness.’

'An episode of severe bad weather is definitely significant enough to turn a flat growth figure into a falling one.’

Economists define a recession as two quarters in a row of negative growth.

Dismal growth numbers from the Office for National Statistics on Friday will add to the pressure on the Chancellor George Osborne to abandon the Bank of England’s inflation target in order to boost growth.

Many economists believe that the Bank should break with its single-minded focus on the 2pc inflation target – which it has not met for several years in any case – and take on a broader mandate to stimulate the economy.

New governor Mark Carney suggested in a recent speech he might favour a target that included growth as well as inflation.

‘The inflation target is well past its sell by date, which it reached at the turn of the millennium,’ Spencer said, adding that the UK is doomed to at least two years more of sluggish growth if the Bank and the Chancellor do not take a different approach.

Critics, however, fear it could send out signals that the Bank has turned soft on inflation, with potentially ruinous consequences for pensioners and others on a fixed income.

The Item Club forecasts growth of just 0.9pc for the whole of 2013 with a slow revival to 1.9pc in 2014 and 2.5pc in 2014.

Spencer said the government’s ‘mid-term report should read “could do better”’ and urged more infrastructure spending and investment in the housing market.

The UK crawled out of recession in the third quarter of last year but other  economists also fear it is hurtling back into a slump.

Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said that a dip in growth in the fourth quarter of last year would in part be due to an unwinding of the ‘Olympic effect’ that boosted the economy over the summer.

But he added: ‘There is significant concern that the weakness goes deeper than that and the UK is headed for a genuine “triple dip”.

A wave of bad news on jobs and consumer spending has hit the economy in recent weeks.

Employees in the shadow of the axe include 800 staff at  Honda’s Swindon plant, 1,300 at collapsed camera chain Jessops,  760 at movie rental business Blockbuster and more than 4,000 at HMV.

Employment overall has remained strong despite the downturn because firms have been holding on to staff in the hope of a recovery round the corner. There are fears the growth in private sector jobs could go into reverse if an economic revival fails to materialise.
