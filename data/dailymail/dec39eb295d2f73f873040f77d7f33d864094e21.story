They're the latest in a rolling series of documents to be released by National Archives and the Clinton Presidential Library, which are expected to total more than 30,000 pages this year.

But the most recent insights into the Bill Clinton White House may just be the most entertaining.

The documents - which have previously been exempted from disclosure requirements because they involve appointments to federal office and confidential advice to the former President - feature jokes Clinton had drafted into speeches but decided not to say when came time to deliver.

Of particular amusement are some references to his former Vice President, Al Gore, and independent rival, Ross Perot, according to CBS News.

Barrel of laughs: New documents released by National Archives and the Clinton Presidential Library have revealed untold jokes that were drafted into speeches by Bill Clinton during his presidency.

The disclosure exemptions of the documents expired in 2013, 12 years after Clinton's run as president.

The National Archives notified representatives of Clinton and President Obama of its intent to disclose the records.

Lawyers have been reviewing the records to determine if new exemptions should apply.

'Some of my friends in Hollywood have started working on Home Alone 3. But their negotiations broke down with Macaulay Culkin. So, now, they're asking for George. I figure, why not? With a little make-up he might look old enough for the part.'

- Joke about Clinton advisor George Stephanopoulos

One of the best of the 'untold jokes' of former US President Bill Clinton (L) refers to his former Vice President Al Gore (R)

'Did you see Ross Perot on TV last Sunday? .... You're in a minority. Boy, I never thought I'd say that to this crowd.''Ross Perot says Federal employees get all these special privileges... like free rides on the subway. Heck, everyone knows all Federal workers use chauffeured limousines.''I've got to hand it to Ross, though. A guy with BILLIONS, asking people to send him 15 dollars each. It's not a bad investment. You get this really neat decoder ring.'

'I know you've been hearing that there are some unorthodox goings-on in the Oval Office. You've heard... that I let photographer Annie Liebowitz bring in a boom box to play rock and roll full blast.. that an Elvis impersonator came in and sang 'All Shook Up'... that Paul Begala came this close to showing a room full of people his jockeys. I want to set the record straight. They were boxer shorts, Fruit of the Loom.'

Butt of many jokes: Ross Perot was an independent U.S. presidential candidate who ran against Bill Clinton

'Sometimes journalists get too carried 
away pronouncing judgments ... Just listen to what the press is saying 
about that cult leader in Texas: 'crazed for attention' ... 'driven by a
 messianic complex' ... Don't you think you guys have been a little 
tough on Ross Perot?'

- Joke crossed out from Clinton's remarks at the 1993 Radio and TV Correspondents Association Dinner

'For starters, I apologized to 
Walter Mears for a crack I made last year at one of the media dinners, 
when I said I could go over the heads of the media because of Larry 
King. And Walter said: 'Big deal, Mr. President. We can go over your 
head to Hillary'. '

- Joke crossed out from Clinton's remarks at the 1994 Gridiron Dinner

No one's safe: TV anchor George Stephanopoulos was a longtime Clinton advisor

'It's an honor to share this dais with 
so many important political figures: Governor Bush, General Powell, 
Senator Lott, and Mr. Forbes. I spent Inaugural week surrounded by 
people who want me to succeed... tonight I'm surrounded by people who 
want to succeed me.'

'Which reminds me, I can't stay too late. I'm starting to get nervous about leaving Al Gore alone at the White House.'

- Joke from Clinton's remarks at the 1997 Alfalfa Club Dinner, with zinger about Al Gore removed

As everyone knows, tonight's program is not what was originally planned. Jon Stewart is here because Rosie O'Donnell cancelled, and I stand before you because Colin Powell couldn't make it.'
