Threatened: A Texas family with several grandchildren who are terrorized by wild hogs has reached out to the Campbell family for help in the latest episode of American Hoggers

Help: One of the young girls is seen on the leg of her grandfather as they explain their problem with the hogs that threaten their children's safety

'I love children. I sure don't want no kids getting eat up by some wild hogs,' said 64-year-old hog catcher Jerry Campbell in the latest episode of American Hoggers on Wednesday.

With over 50 years’ experience, Mr Cambell and his family specialize in hunting the area's growing feral hog population estimated in the state to be at three million.

Costing Texas annually $50 million in damages, the invasive species of pig regularly terrorizes residents and ranches.

As the programme states: 'Anything that weighs up to 400lbs, runs at 30 mph and eats its own young is no joke.'

Assessing: Jerry Campbells, with over 50 years of experience hunting hogs, is seen meeting with the family at their home which he describes as being up against some of the worst swamp country he's seen

Caught: After a hunt through the home's surrounding marshes, a 260lb wild hog is seen after its capture by the Campbell family

'In the woods, it's scary,' one of the tiny blonde granddaughters tells Mr Cambell hoping to help convince him of the seriousness of their problem.

There to help, Mr Cambell describes that family's house being up against some of the worst swamp country he's seen.

After tracking the hogs around their home, the episode concludes with a whopper of a catch.

Seen posed over the animal's body, the family shows the final kill of a 260lb hog that had once ran free in the family's backyard marshes.

The American Hoggers episode helped kick off the show’s second season this week.
