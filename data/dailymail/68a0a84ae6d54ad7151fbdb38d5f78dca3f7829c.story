Just when a girl has her high-heel sashay perfected, along comes an escalator.

Moments earlier this young lady had been click-clacking confidently along in her stilettos.

But all it took was one step on the escalator for her day to go seriously downhill – or make that uphill.

Somehow her heel became caught on a step and although she battled gamely to free herself, she eventually toppled backwards and was carried in a rather undignified fashion all the way to the top.

'Reverse plank': A woman gets onto an escalator at London Euston station unaware of what is about to happen

There she goes: But the woman's heel became caught in the step of the escalator and she fell over

Moving on up: The CCTV video issued by Network Rail today shows the woman being carried up the escalator

Still going: The incident happened after the woman fell over backwards onto the escalator and was dragged up

Nearly there: The woman eventually got to the top of the escalator, still without having managed to stand up

Recorded slips, trips and falls at Britain’s railway stations from April 2011 to March 2012 from Rail Safety and Standards Board

Network Rail released CCTV images of 
her unceremonious journey at London Euston in a campaign to urge 
commuters to take extra care over Christmas.

More than 3,000 people slipped, tripped or fell at railway stations in the past 12 months.

Luggage is often a culprit, with incidents involving people lugging suitcases and bags up by 70 per cent in seven years.

The woman’s fall from grace  happened
 back in April.

But rail bosses believe such slip-ups can  be a seasonal
 hazard at Christmas time, when commuters are often travelling home from
 parties.

Helped by a gallant passer-by when she got to the top, the woman  was none the worse for her ordeal by escalator.

Robin Gisby, from Network Rail, said:
 ‘A combination of more people carrying Christmas shopping, trailing 
wheelie suitcases, wet and windy weather and people travelling late 
after festive parties make December a time where we see more people take
 a tumble.

‘Please plan ahead so that  you don’t
 end up rushing to catch  your train – falling over could be  a 
miserable end to an enjoyable evening.’

Another clip in the video, filmed at Leeds station in West Yorkshire and named ‘the mad dash and crash', sees and a woman fall head-first into the platform as she is running to catch her train.

The third video, also filmed at Leeds and called 'the pole dance crunch', features two women in party dresses twirl around a pole before falling face first and sprawling onto the platform.

VIDEO: Could it be you? Be careful in your heels this Christmas!

Almost 1,500 incidents from April 2011 to March 2012 involved people slipping on the concourse, 1,120 saw them fall down stairs and around 900 on the platform. There were 512 falls on escalators.

More than 400 people fell when running, 
while incidents involving luggage now account for a fifth of the total 
at 614. More than 400 incidents involved a person who was drunk.

'It’s always important to remain aware of
 your surroundings, particularly at this time of year when more of us 
are out shopping and partying'

Assistant Chief Constable Alan Pacey, British Transport Police

Last December saw 322 incidents, accounting for 10 per cent of the total, and Fridays were the most common day for a slip, trip or fall to occur - with more than a third between 5pm and 2.30am.

Assistant Chief Constable Alan Pacey of British Transport Police said: ’It’s always important to remain aware of your surroundings, particularly at this time of year when more of us are out shopping and partying. We will be supporting rail staff, especially during the evenings, to help them ensure everyone has a safe and secure journey.’
