An Air New Zealand stewardess has been warned after a boozy flight from the United States carrying All Blacks.

The off-duty flight attendant straddled All Black Israel Dagg on the flight in a kind of sky high lap dance, Fairfax Media reported.

'Any suggestions of an off duty crew member performing any kind of dance are not correct,' Air NZ cabin crew general manager Leeanne Langridge said.

The airline had completed an investigation into events on the flight, she added.

'One cabin crew member returning to New Zealand as a passenger has received a written warning after their behaviour did not meet our expectations.'

Seven off-duty crew were on the flight which brought the All Blacks home from their northern tour in November.

The airline investigated after reports the off-duty crew got drunk, abused fellow staff and cuddled All Blacks on the flight.

Landridge told Fairfax some of the crew were temporarily banned from drinking alcohol while travelling as passengers. 

There has apparently been a string of similar incidents involving some of the younger members of the Air New Zealand team.

Dagg has just married girlfriend Daisy Aitken in the Hawke's Bay.
