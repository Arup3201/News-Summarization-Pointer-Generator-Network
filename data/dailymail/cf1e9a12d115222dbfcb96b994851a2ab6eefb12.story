A psychotic mother smothered her baby after her marriage hit a crisis and she began using cannabis heavily.

Carly Jacques developed post-natal depression three months after giving birth, when her husband confessed he had made one of her best friends pregnant during an 18-month affair.

Jacques started taking cannabis – at one point using £60 worth of the drug every day or two – and developed mental problems.

'Illness rather than wickedness': Carly Jacques (left) smothered her seven-month-old baby, Skye, after suffering delusions. She was found by her husband Mark (right) clutching their daughter on the sofa of their Leicester home

By the time she smothered daughter 
Skye, when the infant was seven months old, she was suffering from 
delusions and had become convinced neighbours were out to harm her and 
the child.

Yesterday the 32-year-old  customer 
services manager was made the subject of a hospital order after a judge 
ruled she needed to be given treatment rather than punishment.

Jacques had previously admitted the 
rarely-used charge of infanticide – defined as the killing of a child 
under the age of 12 months by their mother, but who at the time of the 
act was of disturbed mind, having not fully recovered from the effect of
 giving birth.

Following the case, her mother, Julie
 Tame, said: ‘Carly was a fantastic mum. Her husband cheated on her with
 one of her best friends and that triggered her mental decline. He 
destroyed her world.’

The couple had been married five years but had been together since Jacques was 18.

Leicester Crown Court heard that 
following her husband Mark’s confession in March last year, Jacques 
began showing symptoms of post-natal depression and turned to cannabis.

Downward spiral: Mrs Jacques developed depression after learning of her husband's affair with another woman and then triggered delusions by smoking large amounts of cannabis

She started to suffer delusions, suggesting there was a body in her attic and she was being filmed in her home.

Her GP prescribed Prozac and referred her to a counsellor.

The court heard that the night before Skye died in October, Jacques had been smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol at a party.

When her husband woke up  at their 
home in Leicester the following morning, he went downstairs to discover 
Jacques clutching the ‘obviously blue’ body of their daughter.

She was holding a blade in her hand 
and said: ‘What have I done?’ She then slashed her own wrists as her 
husband – who was not in court – struggled to disarm her.

Jacques then slashed her neck with a carving knife before she was again disarmed and taken to hospital.

Skye suffered no visible injuries and the cause of death was given  as smothering.

Jacques needed 40 stitches for her 
injuries. Police arrested her in hospital on suspicion of murder and she
 admitted what she had done. She told police: ‘I just thought we could 
go to sleep and we would both be safe.’

The court heard Jacques had tried to commit suicide the week before she smothered her child.
Mary Prior, defending, said Jacques was ‘a good mother’ but it was clear
 that what caused the tragedy ‘was the admission from her husband of an 
affair’.

Sentencing her, Judge Michael Pert QC
 said: ‘I am satisfied that what led you to that terrible act was 
illness rather than wickedness.’

Jacques was made the subject of a Section 37 Hospital Order. She was also handed a Section 41 Restriction Order.

This means doctors must first seek permission from the Ministry of Justice before Jacques can be discharged from hospital care.
