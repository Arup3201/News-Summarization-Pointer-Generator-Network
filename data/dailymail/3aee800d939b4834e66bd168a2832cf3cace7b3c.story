Wealthy financial executives are using an 'elite' Gumtree service to buy and sell luxury items, including Rolex watches, private jets and even a £10million oceanfront mansion in Miami.

The £11,500-per-year computer network, run by financial information company Bloomberg, is so exclusive that it can only be accessed using a fingerprint scan.

The Bloomberg Professional service, on which the buy-and-sell service is featured, was originally created to allow its 320,000 finance users to see live updates from the stock market.

 wealthy financial executives by finance information company Bloomberg (file pic)

But the company expanded its system to 
feature new 'lifestyle' channels, which allow the traders, wealthy 
stockbrokers and hedge fund executives to buy and sell a range of luxury items.

According to The Times, under one function, known as Posh, there are six sections which feature classified adverts for hundreds of extravagantly-priced items.

The listings - which are featured under sections called travel, cars, property, boats, services and merchandise - include items for sale such as Porsches, Ferraris and designer watches, from the likes of Patek Philippe, Rolex and Breitling.

The platform operates in the same manner as the more well-known Gumtree, allowing users to upload listings of their items for sale with a price tag and enabling buyers to scroll through and filter results.

However, the items listed are of much more exclusivity than the average Gumtree adverts, with items up for sale also including diamond rings, sports cars and even multi-million pound homes.

The most expensive item listed is a multi-million dollar lodge on Key Biscayne, an exclusive island south of Miami beach.

dollar six-bedroom lodge on Key Biscayne (above) - an exclusive island 
south of Miami beach - which can be snapped up for just over £10million

The 'Posh' function of the system, is split 
into six categories including travel, property, cars, merchandise and 
services and shows items for sale such as Audis, Porsches and boats

With a price tag of just over £10million, the
 privately-gated mansion boasts six bedrooms, six bathrooms, a rooftop 
garden complete with an infinity pool, a spa, a gym, outdoor showers, 
unrivalled panoramic ocean views, a four-car garage and an internal 
lift.

The property 
section also includes an advert for a £2.75m townhouse in Kensington, 
west London which has four bedrooms and boasts about being within close proximity to ‘St 
Paul’s, Bute House and Latymer Upper Schools’.

As well as using the network to sell property, others are also taking advantage of it and using it as a rental platform.

One advert offers a two-and-a-half acre five-bedroom property for rent in the Hamptons, New York.

While claiming to be just 'six minutes from the town, close to the beach and near the best night life in the Hamptons', the property is available to rent for either £10,000-per-week or £5,000-per-weekend.

Those with a bit more cash to splash can rent the mansion for the whole of July for £35,000 or for August at a cost of £40,000.

Another rental listing offers a stay in a lodge at the Ritz Carlton Club in Aspen for £400-per-night.

fingerprint scan. Items for sale include a Porsche 911 Turbo (above,

Designers watches are among the most popular items for sale, with one Rolex Gold Daytona being listed for £14,000 - which the buyer claims is a 25 per cent discount from its UK retail price.

Based in London, the seller claims pictures are available on request and states that the watch 'can be viewed in the city'.

While most of the items are high-end luxury, there are a couple of listings which offer slightly more affordable options.

The
 cheapest item available on the site is a gift card for Gap, which is up
 for sale for just over £10. With about £15 credit on the store card, 
the user claims to be selling it because 'I don't shop here'.

Another 'cheap' item listed for sale is a set of black car mats for a C-class Mercedes, priced at £100, The Times reported.

There are also some rather more unique items and services for sale on the site.

According to Buzzfeed, one user, from Hong Kong, offers his wife's 'seriously sexy knee-high python-skin boots' for sale. 

The seller has listed the Christian 
Louboutin boots with a price tag of £850 and claims his wife has never 
worn them because 'they are four sizes too big' for her.

Designer watches are among the most popular items for sale on the financial platform, 
with one Rolex Daytona (above, file picture) being listed for £14,000 - 
which the buyer claims is a 25 per cent discount from its UK retail 
price

Giving his reason for selling the item, the user claims the boots are 'exceptional to look at on the mantlepiece, but they were made to be worn and gaped at'.

He claims pictures are available on request via WhatsApp.

The system appears to have spread worldwide, with listings appearing from various different countries.

As well as plenty of goods available from the UK and US, there is also a 15th century Italian castle for sale for £15.8million, an estate with a ten-bedroom mansion in Majorca for £11.5million and a 'beautiful dressage horse' costing £27,500 from Amsterdam.

A Geneva-based stockbroker told The Times that the service was 'reasonably well-known' among Bloomberg users.

As well as Posh, the service includes Dine, which provides restaurant reviews, and Fly, which can be used to check flight departure times.

Hotel, which will specialise in hotel reviews, is due to be added next year.
