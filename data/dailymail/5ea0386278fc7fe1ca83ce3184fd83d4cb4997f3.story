Four have-a-go-hero Brits sailing a converted warship to Africa on what they describe as an 'anti-piracy' mission have been arrested off Senegal.

Armed marine commandos boarded their decommissioned fast attack gun ship Defender, which has two fearsome-looking cannons, and took them into custody in Dakar.

The Senegalese authorities said the four - all ex-UK servicemen - were detained on suspicion of 'illegal activity'.

Farcical: The gunboat Defender, pictured impounded in Tenerife, was being crewed by four British ex-servicemen on an 'anti-piracy' mission,Â  It has now been seized by Senegalese authorities

The group, led by former Royal Navy 
submariner Chris Enmarch, had already had the 127ft Defender 
impounded in the Canary Islands.

The Spanish were suspicious that the 
vessel was registered as a pleasure craft and confiscated their British 
flag and ordered them to remain in port in Tenerife.

But after five weeks on the island the crew gave the authorities the slip - only to be impounded a second time five days later.

The group are reported to be heading to the pirate-infested Gulf of Guinea where they planned to offer security to oil rigs.

They insist they are 'not mercenaries' and their boat has no working weapons or ammunition.

They left Cornwall on April 16 and before departing Mr Enmarch, from Penryn, said they were going on an anti-piracy mission.

He said they were heading to Senegal 
'to discuss with the authorities the possible use of the Defender as a 
deterrent against illegal fishing boats.'

Defender, which is no 
longer on the UK Ships Register, was built in Lowestoft in the mid-1970s
 for the Sultan of Oman's navy in the Gulf and decommissioned in 2002

The crew, which also includes Andrew 
Bayliss from Saltash, Cornwall, first ran into trouble off Tenerife on 
April 23 when their ship blew a gasket.

They were forced to stop in the 
resort of Los Cristianos where they were boarded by Spanish Civil Guard 
officers who refused them permission to stay there.

The vessel was then escorted 50 miles to a berth in the island's Santa Cruz port by a Spanish navy warship.

Officials are understood to have been
 suspicious that the formidable looking vessel, which flies the British 
flag, was registered as a pleasure boat.

The Spanish ministry of defence said 
an inspection revealed 'irregularities in the paperwork of the boat and 
its crew, as well as deficiencies in safety equipment'.

Mr Enmarch, 53, who bought the boat 
in 2011, was fined 40,000 euros because its waste systems did not meet 
standards set for pleasure vessels.

The ship's British pendant was removed and it was placed under the custody of armed Civil Guards.

One report in Spain said the Defender was actually en route for Nigeria.

Mr Enmarch accused the Spanish 
authorities of making a 'fuss about nothing' and said the cannons on his
 boat were 'just for show and totally unusable'.

But in the early hours of May 31, 
while the guards were called away, the Defender set off with the fine 
allegedly outstanding and five days later it was intercepted off 
Senegal.

Colonel Abdou Thiam, spokesman for 
the Senegal Army, said the ship was being held in Dakar and four British
 former members of the armed forces had been arrested.

Sources identified Mr Enmarch and Mr Bayliss as two of the arrested men.

A second Army spokesman said the ship
 had been detained over suspected 'illegal activity' but refused to 
disclose further details.

The Foreign Office said: 'We are 
aware of the arrest of four British Nationals in Senegal. We stand ready
 to provide consular assistance.'

The 135 tons Defender, which is no 
longer on the UK Ships Register, was built in Lowestoft in the mid-1970s
 for the Sultan of Oman's navy in the Gulf and decommissioned in 2002.

After buying the ship in 2011 Mr 
Enmarch told the Maldon Chronicle newspaper: 'Defender's task will be to
 deter any pirates intent on boarding the many ships that pass the East 
African coastline.

'One look at her should be enough to send them looking for easier targets.

'She will be manned by handpicked 
ex-Royal Marine Commandos and run as a professional naval ship, obeying 
the rules of engagement.

'Our primary task will be to protect 
oil platforms which are towed close to the coast of East Africa, and a 
number of oil companies want to hire Defender to look after their 
interests.

'We are not mercenaries; this is 
strictly a business venture similar to other British private protection 
firms which operate in Iraq and Afghanistan.
