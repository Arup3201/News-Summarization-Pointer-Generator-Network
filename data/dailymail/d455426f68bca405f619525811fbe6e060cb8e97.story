He has proved he is absolutely brilliant with a tennis racket but when it comes to dealing with the luggage, Andy Murray leaves that to his girlfriend Kim Sears.

The US Open champion has arrived back on British soil to cheers following his historic win in New York on Monday night and was mobbed by fans.

The tennis ace flew into Heathrow’s Terminal 5 at around 9am with girlfriend Kim and was greeted by British Airways staff and excited members of the public.

Murray, dressed in jeans and a hooded 
top, was photographed by waiting media and posed for pictures with 
holidaymakers and airport staff as he collected his luggage.

But it was left to Kim to wheel the trolley while the Scot took the plaudits for becoming the first British man in 76 years to win a major singles title when he beat Novak Djokovic over five sets in the US Open final.

However, it is claimed that his loyal girlfriend's love and support over the past seven years will be rewarded, as Andy could be set to propose.

A source close to Murray said he would be taking a few days out following his arrival in London.

He will take some time to rest and 'get his head right' before deciding what to do next, the source said.

Murray admitted before leaving New York that he was not sure what reaction his new status would bring on his return.

He said: 'It's something that will probably take a bit of getting used to. It's not something I've always been that comfortable with.

'I spoke to (coach) Ivan (Lendl) a couple of times during the year and he asked me, 'What worries you?'.

'I said that I worry what might happen if I win a major, how my life might change, because I want it to be the same.

'He said he felt the same thing but all that happens is you get more people congratulating you and you get nicer tables in restaurants and to play on all the good golf courses for free.'

Murray has laughed off talk of a knighthood but the question of how Britain will honour the champion remains.

A golden post box already stands in his hometown of Dunblane following his victory at the Olympics, and his local authority is in talks to offer him the Freedom of the City of Stirling

'The whole community will want to congratulate Andy on his first gland slam title and on the glorious, warrior-like way he won it,' said Stirling Provost councillor Mike Robbins.

The Scot's odds of becoming BBC Sports Personality of the Year have, meanwhile, been slashed.Murray will next compete at the Japan Open on October 1, according to the schedule on his official website.

He will be defending the title after beating Spaniard Rafael Nadal in Tokyo last year, where he also took a victory in the doubles tournament alongside older brother Jamie.

The US win completed a successful few months for the 25-year-old, who followed a Wimbledon final with Olympic gold.

Following his US victory Murray hailed the effect Britain’s magical sporting summer has had on the country.

He said yesterday: “Being around the Olympics and seeing how the nation came together, from the public to the athletes to the press, everyone was just right behind it.

'Sport has been this huge part of my life since I was a kid and it’s been the best summer of sport in my lifetime and I’m sure in most people’s. It’s been so much fun and I’m just happy I was able to contribute towards it.'

It is not yet known whether Murray will take part in a parade for Scotland’s Olympic athletes in Glasgow on Friday.

With his thrilling five-set US Open victory, Andy Murray is assured of a place in the tennis history books.

His epic triumph also brings the promise of more immediate material rewards, however.

Experts yesterday predicted that by ending the nation's 76-year wait for a Grand Slam men's singles champion, Murray's career earnings could now top £100million – making him one of Britain's richest sports superstars.

His four-hour, 54-minute win over Novak Djokovic was worth almost £1.2million in prize money alone. But that will be dwarfed by the riches set to flood into the 25-year-old's bank account.

Coupled with his Olympic Gold medal-winning defeat of Roger Federer last month, the US Open result will see major international sponsors clamour for a piece of 'Brand Murray'.

The importance of Murray's commercial interests was clear to see immediately after the match had concluded, when Murray looked agitated as he tried to find a watch provided by one of his sponsors.

On-court microphones caught the British number one saying 'I don't have it, I don't have it' as he pointed at his wrist.

Limping in pain, he called out from the court to his girlfriend Kim Sears, who was wearing an expensive-looking timepiece herself: 'Have you got my watch? I don't have my watch.'

Luckily for the tennis star, the watch - a Rado D-Star Automatic Chronograph worth £2,580 - was found in time for him to wear it as he received the trophy.

Only three months ago, he was announced as an ambassador for watchmakers Rado - a sponsorship deal reportedly worth a seven-figure sum.

Speaking after the match, Murray was full of relief. Despite his Olympics triumph in London last month, the boy from Dunblane was the underdog heading into the match, having lost in four Grand Slam tournament finals.

'Right now, there's a lot of relief and I'm still buzzing a bit from the match - the atmosphere out there was unbelievable,' he said.

'It would have been a tough one to lose so I'm so, so happy I managed to pull though in the end.

'The body's hurting a bit but it was worth it.'

The windy conditions helped Murray in the early stages but Djokovic fought back once it had started to die down. However, the Scot revealed he took a toilet break before the start of the decider to regain his composure.

'The wind calmed down towards the end of the second set and I had to change the way I was playing a bit because he was then dictating more of the points and he started going for it a bit more.

'I was still playing the same way as when it was windy and I was kind of guiding the ball a little bit and was only reaching the middle of the court.

'At the beginning of the fifth set I went to the toilet and I said to myself: "For one set, just give it everything you've got".

'I got lucky in the first game with a net on the break point but I settled down after that.'

His early considerable lead, and a chance at history, slipping away, Murray dug deep for stamina and mental strength in an effort to outlast his Serbian rival.

'Novak is so, so strong. He fights until the end in every single match,' Murray said. 'I don't know how I managed to come through in the end.'
