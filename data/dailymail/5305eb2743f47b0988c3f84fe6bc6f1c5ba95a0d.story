If you thought tending to plants on Earth was tricky, then try growing them in the hostile environment of space.

That’s exactly what one scientist from Virginia is hoping to do using meteorite soil to grow everything from asparagus to potatoes.

If the study proves successful, it could help humans grow their own food in space, helping in the quest to colonise other planets.

Dr Michael Mautner has attempted to grow plants in nutrient-rich meteorite soil. ‘A variety of soil bacteria, algae, and asparagus (pictured) and potato tissue cultures grew well in these asteroid/meteorite soils and also in Martian meteorite soils,’ Dr Mautner reported

At nearly £14,000 ($23,000) to send a kilogram of food into space, cosmic cuisine doesn’t come cheap.

But Dr Michael Mautner isn't the only one looking at space farming as a possible solution to getting food into space. Nasa currently has plans for a 'space farm' and is already experimenting with growing lettuce on the ISS.

As well as cutting costs, Nasa is hoping a 'space farm' will deliver a lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions.

It could also provide something called ‘horticultural therapy’ for astronauts to reduce stress, alleviate depression and improve their overall general health.

The work is part of the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink LED lamps. Nasa claims that after extensive testing on plants on Earth, it doesn’t expect zero-gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants. 

As one of the world's only ‘astroecologists’, Dr Michael Mautner thinks it is entirely possible to, in the future, directly grow certain plants on other planets.

This will be vital for a future colony to survive on Mars, he claims.

The privately-funded Mars One mission plans to  have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Meanwhile, Nasa believes putting man on the red planet will be possible by 2030.

But one of the biggest challenges is providing food to sustain astronauts. Currently its costs nearly £14,000 ($23,000) to send a kilogram of food into space.

The ability to grow cosmic cuisine will cut these costs and provide astronauts with ‘horticultural therapy’ to reduce stress.

Dr Mautner from Virginia Commonwealth University researcher told Motherboard that meteorites often contain phosphate, nitrates, and even water that plants can feed on.

To grow the plants, Dr Mautner ground up meteorites to create something closely resembling soil.

Dr Mautner’s (pictured) experiments are at an early stage. For instance, he has not yet considered the lack of oxygen on other planets or gravity conditions

‘A variety of soil bacteria, algae, and asparagus and potato tissue cultures grew well in these asteroid/meteorite soils and also in Martian meteorite soils,’ Dr Mautner reported.

His plan is to eventually find several different plants and extraterrestrial soil types that provide the best conditions to farm in space.

‘Given the estimated amounts of asteroid materials shows that these resources can support trillions of humans comfortably in our solar system, and eventually, in billions of other solar systems throughout the galaxy,’ Dr Mautner said.

Dr Mautner’s experiment are currently at a very early stage.

For instance, he has not yet factored in the lack of oxygen on other planets, or the varying gravity conditions.

But, he believes, this is the first step to providing the tools needed for humans to better explore the solar system and beyond.

‘Life on Earth is fragile, endangered by nuclear proliferation, genetic misengineering, runaway climate change or major asteroid impacts, and limited by depleting resources,’ Dr Mautner said.

‘Eventually, Earth will become uninhabitable by the expanding sun. In contrast, life in many independent worlds in space can secure life for trillions of eons.’
