An artificial - and very lifelike - ear has been built by scientists using a 3D printer and cartilage from sheep.

The organ was designed by plastic surgeons to make it look as likelike as possible.

Researchers from Massachusetts then grew the required number of cartilage cells to fit custom models under the skin of lab rats.

Wire was added to the moulds to give the implants their shape and make them bend and flex like human ears.

Scientists are now preparing the ear for clinical trials in the hope they could be used in transplant operations.

As the technology is customisable, the 
scientists claim they could eventually use the process to produce 
realistic looking ears for individual patients on a 'rapid timescale.'

The ears were built by Thomas Cervantes, from Massachusetts General Hospital, and his colleagues.

A 3D digital model was created 
and designed with help from a facial plastic surgeon to make sure the 
shape and proportions were correct.

The
 resulting model was printed and cast in polydimethylsiloxane, a special
 silicone compound, to create a mould which was then split along the 
outer contour, resulting in two pieces.

These moulds were filled with cow collagen, the naturally occurring protein that gives skin elasticity and strength.

Researchers then harvested ear cartilage cells from sheep.

The researchers from Massachusetts worked with a plastic surgeon to create the 3D mould. It was filled with cow collagen while the team grew enough cartilage cells inside rats to replace the collagen in the mould. Wires were then added to help maintain the shape of the ears

Scientists
 at Princeton University have created a breakthrough bionic ear that can
 'hear' radio frequencies beyond the range of normal human ears.

The researchers used a radical 3D printing technique to create the ear with the electronics of a hearing aid inside it.

They
 say it is a major step towards creating 'cybermen' such as those seen 
in the Terminator films, which combine living cells and electronic 
circuits.

Earlier this 
year, doctors from Cornell University used 3D printing to create a 
prosthetic ear using cells of cartilage, similar to the ones created in 
Massachusetts.

A solid plastic mould was printed and then filled with high-density collagen gel.

The researchers then added cartilage cells into the collagen matrix. 

For
 the prototype, they used cells taken from cows, but could in theory use
 cells of cartilage from elsewhere in the patient's body. 

These cells were implanted under the skin of lab rats and the team then spent three months growing enough cartilage inside the rats to replace the cow collagen used in the moulds.

The
 researchers said that the modelled ear had enough definition in the 
curves and lines to be recognisable even once a layer of skin had been 
applied to it.

'All the implants were well tolerated,' said Cervantes.

'The implants with wire resembled a human ear, whereas implants without wire were flattened and distorted.

'The surfaces of both were white, glistening and grossly resembled cartilage.

'The constructs with the embedded wire framework had significantly improved size and shape fidelity, compared with those without the framework. The implants were flexible.'

The same team previously carried out a proof of concept study on mice using cartilage cells in an ear-shaped collagen mould, but this was only analysed in 2D.

The researchers said: 'The technology is now under development for clinical trials, and thus we have scaled up and redesigned the prominent features of the scaffold to match the size of an adult human ear and to preserve the aesthetic appearance after implantation.

'We also employed more rigorous methods to analyse the fidelity of the ear geometry after implantation.'

They added: 'These quantitative shape analysis results have identified opportunities to improve shape fidelity of engineered ear constructs.'

Each year thousands of children are born with a congenital deformity called microtia, when the external ear is not fully developed.

Many have an intact inner ear, but experience hearing loss due to the missing external structure.

The findings feature in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

Once the cartilage in the mould had fused and set, researchers put the ear through various stress tests to analyse its flexibility. A layer of skin was also applied to make the ear look more lifelike
