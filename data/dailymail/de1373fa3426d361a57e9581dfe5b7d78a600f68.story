Lotus have confirmed they are to run Mercedes power units from 2015.

The long-term supply arrangement comes as no surprise as Lotus have long been linked with a switch to Mercedes.

The deal brings to an end a long-standing agreement with Renault, who recently made clear Red Bull were their number one team, effectively pushing Lotus to one side.

As Lotus have struggled badly on track this season, partly via design faults and partly by being let down by the Renault power units, they will be hoping for a change in fortune next season.

Formula One team Lotus have announced that, from next year, they will use Mercedes-Benz power units  

With the contract announced ahead of this weekend's inaugural Russian Grand Prix, Lotus CEO Matthew Carter said: 'We are pleased to have been chosen by Mercedes AMG High-Performance Powertrains in a significant long-term deal.

'We intend to return to the front of the field with the goals of winning grands prix and being a strong championship contender once more, and we see this new agreement as one step towards this aim.

'The Mercedes-Benz power unit has shown good performance on track and it is our goal to marry this motive force to Enstone's chassis expertise.

'It is our desire that the new car heralds a new era of success for Enstone.'

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff said the deal was 'strategically important for Mercedes-Benz'

The agreement means Mercedes will again be supplying three teams in 2015 - Williams, Force India, along with Lotus - as well as running their own works programme.

For Mercedes, Lotus replace McLaren as the Woking-based marque return to Honda, with the Japanese manufacturing giant back in F1 for the first time in seven years.

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff said: 'It was strategically important for Mercedes-Benz to continue to supply three customers throughout this generation of power unit, in addition to the primary focus on our Silver Arrows works team.

Lotus, ending their relationship with Renault, will take McLaren's place as Mercedes' customer 

'It was therefore clear we would be looking for a new customer from 2015.

'Lotus F1 Team is an impressive organisation that has delivered competitive on-track performances in recent seasons.

'We are pleased to welcome them to the Mercedes-Benz family and look forward to building a productive  working relationship in the years ahead.'
