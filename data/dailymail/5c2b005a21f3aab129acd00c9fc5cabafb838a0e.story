The truth is one I have only recently acknowledged, but I am in no doubt now that it is universal: if you have a husband, you should also get a shed.

All married men need one — a place where they can do important things such as tinker with perfectly functioning bikes, read comics and drink Thermos tea (for an average of around 26 days a year, as one recent report conservatively estimated).

For years, ‘heading to the shed’ has been a technique for escaping ’er indoors. But while men may have always been allowed to think it’s their idea to get a shed, I now realise it’s women who really drive the plan.

Hilary Boyd is more than happy to let her husband lock himself away in the shed while she gets on with writing

Sheds, I have discovered, are essential places in which to contain a husband. And for every man who’s smugly congratulating himself on breaking out for some sneaky man time, you can bet there’s a wife breathing a huge sigh of relief at having him out from under her feet.

I think I may have struck upon the cure for our soaring divorce rate which, tellingly, is particularly prolific among the over-60s — the age that retirement sets in and couples suddenly find themselves permanently, and seemingly maddeningly, rubbing shoulders under one roof.

Simply make sure he has a mini, felted roof of his own.

Until recently I wasn’t lucky enough to have a shed in my life. So my husband of 41 years, Don, was on the loose. And as a selfish writer who works from home, this spelt disaster.

I am the sort who needs total quiet and isolation when I’m writing. I am in awe of writers who work alongside their partners. Maeve Binchy wrote side by side with her husband, Gordon, in the same room; twin typewriters next to each other. Can you imagine?

Don and I used to settle ourselves at opposite ends of our one-and-a-half-bedroom flat in North London, and I still couldn’t manage it. The ‘half’ was my office, and Don — a crazy film-maker type — had an office in town where he went daily.

But modern technology meant he could do a lot of his work — running an online arts website — from home.

This meant the Boyd family scenario during the week went as follows: ‘Are you going into work now?’ I’d say, ever-so-casually after breakfast, at around 9am.

‘Yes,’ Don would say. ‘I’ve got a meeting at 11am.’

A t that point, I would retreat to my office and pretend to start writing. In reality, I’d be sitting waiting for sounds that he was going — the blessed shout of goodbye that meant I could start scribbling in peace.

Not because he was making a noise as such, but because he was there, lurking. After a while, I’d pop back out. ‘How’s it going?’ I’d ask, nonchalantly.

‘Fine,’ he’d reply.

‘Are you off soon?’ I’d persist.

Then he’d look hurt. ‘OK, OK, I’m going in a minute. I don’t see what difference it makes me being here — I’m not making a sound.’

And another row would ensue, me incoherently trying to explain why his silent presence was as annoying as nails on a blackboard.

I’m sure anyone reading this is probably feeling sorry for Don right now. And fair enough. I was being a bit of a harridan, wanting to chuck my husband out of his own home. But I couldn’t write with him there, not in that tiny space — and it became crucial to the harmony of our relationship and ongoing success of my career that this chucking out issue got sorted.

So, this year, we made the momentous decision to move out of London — where I’ve lived for more than six decades — to find somewhere bigger, more peaceful, where Don could have his own office at home.

Still, at the back of my mind, I was worried. Wouldn’t it be the same as in the flat: Don in his new office, me in the next room, itching to have the house all to myself?

As soon as we stepped through the door of any potential home, I immediately scanned the bedroom situation to see if there would be enough separation. And mostly there wasn’t.

Then we walked into this small cottage by the coast in West Sussex, and I spied the answer to all our problems: a shed. Hallelujah! A converted garage across the small garden, already kitted out as an office, and a thousand miles away from the lovely spare bedroom — my space — in the attic.

We decided to take it straight away.

And here we are, four months later, settled into our new place near the sea. Don still goes up to London a couple of days a week, but the time he is at home is happily spent in our marriage-saving shed.

Now and again I’ll take him a cup of tea, sometimes even make him lunch, and encourage him in his latest endeavour.

All I need to do now is make sure he never, ever retires.
