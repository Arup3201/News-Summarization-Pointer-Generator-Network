Perhaps it explained his restless manner on the touchline. Jose Mourinho is not at ease when his defence springs a leak. It doesn't happen often, but it disturbs him when it does.

It happened at Tottenham and again at home to Bradford. Add to this, the nerves of an intense tie between two clubs who have grown to share an intense dislike of each other over the last decade.

This was snarling Jose on full power, disputing every decision, picking fights, pressurising officials. He was deep into another complaint to fourth official Phil Dowd when Branislav Ivanovic scored in the fourth minute of extra-time.

Mourinho will be worried about the defensive issues that have began to sneak into his side's performances 

He missed the goal. But here was a show for his team, a sign that they would have to scrap and fight for this one. This would not be about making friends with attractive exhibition football.

Diego Costa did not need telling twice. Nor did Gary Cahill. After starting 30 games for Chelsea this season, Cahill watched from a seat behind the manic figure of his manager.

This attitude underpinned five major trophies during Mourinho's first spell at Stamford Bridge and he turned it up in pursuit of the first silverware of his second spell.

Having conceded 20 goals in the first five months of the season – including three in a quite bizarre win at Everton back in August – Chelsea let in 10 in the first six games of 2015.

There were five at Tottenham, four against Bradford and there might have been more than one at Anfield last week. Cahill was there for them all; something of a common denominator, you might say. And last night he paid the price.

Having been one of the successes of Mourinho's first season back at the Bridge, he was axed as the manager tried to add pace and mobility to his back-four, a specific reaction to Raheem Sterling at centre-forward. Filipe Luis ahead of Cesar Azpilicueta was a similar concession to Liverpool's style and strengths.

Defensive solidity has always been a trademark of Mourinho's Chelsea teams, but there have been tiny cracks appearing. Last week at Anfield, Sterling unsettled his team; too quick and mobile for Cahill on the equaliser. There were other situations, too, which might have led to goals.

Chelsea escaped with the tie level but one of Mourinho knew he has always been a coach with the ability to notice a problem and react.

Out went Cahill. It may only be a temporary issue at this point but it will reverberate within the England camp, where the Chelsea centre-half has been earmarked as one of Roy Hodgson's on-field leaders, and vice-captain. Moreover, there is not a great wealth of alternatives.

Hodgson will watch with interest to see if this is the start of Zouma easing past Cahill in the pecking order at Stamford Bridge. Or perhaps a sign that the Chelsea boss will target a long-term central defensive upgrade in the transfer market. Zouma certainly did not give the impression of a finished article on only his tenth start for the club he joined in the summer. He signed a year ago from St Etienne but completed the season in France.

At the age of 20, this was a big test of temperament as much as ability. John Terry gave him an extra-long pre-kick-off man-hug and a word of advice. Zouma has all the physical requirements to be a successful centre-half in England. He is enormous, brave and quick across the ground, cutting a figure like a young Sol Campbell.

But there was an early error of judgment on half-way, when he was drawn under a high ball and released Sterling with a glancing header. He had the pace to recover as Sterling skipped past Terry on the edge of the penalty box.

Steven Gerrard unzipped the Chelsea back-four with pass between Zouma, on the right of the centre-halves, and the right-back, which was Willian at the time, since Ivanovic was elsewhere, still deciding how to divide his attention between wing-back Alberto Moreno and the more advanced threat of Philippe Coutinho.

Mourinho missed Ivanovic's goal in extra-time becuase he was complaining to fourth official Phil Dowd

Ivanovic was erratic in the first-half although he would ultimately make amends with his goal. Nemanja Matic was not at his best and Mourinho was upset by the reluctance of his central midfielders to pass the ball forward, quickly on the turnover of possession, and turned his despair to his staff as they often opted to play towards their own goal.

Injuries to Cesc Fabregas and Luis Filipe will worry him but the way Liverpool's attacking players troubled Chelsea will also eat away at Mourinho with Manchester City here on Saturday and Paris St Germain waiting in the Champions League. He will enjoy the clean sheet, but it will not fool him.

Thibaut Courtois saved well from Moreno who collected the splendid Gerrard pass, as he did when Philippe Coutinho glided past Zouma, on the half-hour. There were still big holes in the Chelsea defensive unit. More clinical finishing by Liverpool and they would have been behind at the break.

There may be issues in Chelsea's defence at present, but Thibaut Courtois remains a rock in goal 

Courtois was quite immense throughout, and his early saves bought Mourinho time to adjust and stabilise the team. The home team were stronger in the second half, more successful at breaking up Liverpool's rhythm in the midfield and cutting the supply to the fluent forwards.

They were helped by the general mood of dissent which simmered on the pitch and off it, where the Chelsea boss picked a fight with Rodgers' sidekick Colin Pascoe and Costa with whoever he was nearest to.

Chelsea were not watertight but they protected their clean-sheet with great spirit - and they are going to Wembley with a goal from a defender.
