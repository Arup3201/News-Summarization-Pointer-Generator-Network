With these charming sculptures made of butter, it’s easy to see why artist Vipular Athukorale’s reputation is spreading fast.

But be careful not to warm to them too much, or they’ll be toast.

The sculptures measure up to two feet long and take months at a time to make.

They include a vintage Rolls-Royce and a scene from Little Red Riding Hood.

The latter last week won the food art award at the Culinary Olympics, an international cuisine competition held every four years in Germany, although presumably it was a knife-edge decision.

Mr Athukorale, 49, needs a smooth touch when painstakingly crafting the scenes using tiny scalpels.

He said: ‘I started making butter sculptures nearly 30 years ago when I was working as a chef.

'I’d always been into art, and loved studying sculpture at college, when I heard about someone modelling scenes out of butter. I thought it sounded like fun.’

The father-of-one from Belgrave, 
Leicester, begins by creating a basic structure out of stainless steel, 
before covering the wire in butter and moulding it into shape.

As
 long as he keeps the artworks out of direct sunlight, and away from 
radiators, they can last for years – although they have to be stored in 
plastic cases to keep the dust off.

He said: ‘Once I start sculpting, I am totally absorbed in it.

Enough to melt the heart: The sculptures are amazingly finely detailed

'I have a little room in our house dedicated to sculpting, and once I’m in there, my family know not to even try to get my attention until I’ve finished.

‘My wife is very patient and understanding.’

He added: ‘I’m pleased the competition went well, and that I’ll have some time off before I start my  next sculpture.

‘I might stick to jam on my toast  for a while though – I’m a bit sick  of butter.’
