The family of a man who was killed in a tragic road accident along with two of his children have revealed their heartbreak after the killer driver was told by a judge he could be out on parole by 2016.

On June 4 last year, Shaun Zagar was in the car with his children, Kaleb, 6, and Zara, 5, in regional NSW near the town of Casino, waiting for the bus which would take them off to school for the day.

'I can just imagine they were just sitting in there in the car, minding their own business, waiting for the bus. This bullet from nowhere came out and just T-boned them,' Shaun's father Andrew Zagar told A Current Affair.

Andrew and Julie Zagar have spoken of their heartbreak after the man who killed their son and two grandchildren could serve just two years behind bars

The 28-year-old father of three and two of his children, his eldest son Kaleb just a day away from his seventh birthday, all had their lives claimed by the tragic crash.

This week the driver of that car Malcolm Joseph Harris was handed his sentence, one the Zagar family are outraged by.

For the accident which flipped Shaun's car and rolled it over a fence before it came to rest almost 30 metres away, Harris could serve just two years behind bars.

The Northern Star report Harris, was sentenced to five years behind bars for two counts of dangerous driving occasioning death and one count of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm.

The 37-year-old also received an extra three years, four months jail, with a non-parole period of two years, for another charge of dangerous driving occasioning death. He is eligible for parole in March 2016.

When the family heard the sentence handed down in court, they were in shock according to Andrew: 'We just shook our heads in disbelief. We thought "what, there must be some sort of mistake"', he revealed.

At the time of the fatal crash Harris is said to have had an array of drugs in his system, was driving unlicenced and with an undiagnosed epilepsy condition.

He also left his own daughter - a passenger in his car - with brain damage.

Harris pleaded guilty to the deaths of Shaun, Kaleb and Zara Zagar, as well as driving under the influence, driving without a licence and the charge relating to his epilepsy condition.

But the Zagar family are planning to appeal the case, meeting with prosecutors on Friday to discuss their options.

'You get life for taking marijuana into Bali. And you've killed three people and I know it might not have been intentional but he got in that car of his own free will', Shaun's mother Julie Zagar told the program.

Andrew said when he saw his son's killer in court this week, Harris mouthed the words 'sorry' across the room at him. However Andrew said that didn't change a thing, as his family were serving a life sentence.

'You've destroyed our family, why did you do this you selfish mongrel? You selfish bloody mongrel', he said.

The Daily Telegraph report that Attorney-General Brad Hazzard is investigating the situation following the public outcry. Andrew said Harris's sentence sent a weak message to the community.

'It's not sending a strong enough message to offenders who do these things. It's not sending a strong enough message to say think, before you actually jump into the car.'

Kaleb and Zara's mother said in a statement to A Current Affair 'He's given us a life sentence so he should have to serve one too. I have to go the rest of my life without seeing my first born son or my only daughter.'

The couple also had another son together.
