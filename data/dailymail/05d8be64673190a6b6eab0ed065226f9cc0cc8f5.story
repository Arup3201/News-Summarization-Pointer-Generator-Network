Arsene Wenger says that the imminent arrival of David Ospina will see the goalkeeper challenge Wojciech Szczesny for the No 1 jersey at Arsenal.

The Gunners have agreed a a £3.2million fee with Nice for the keeper who starred for Colombia at the World Cup - helping them to reach the quarter-finals before losing to hosts Brazil.

It was believed that the 25-year-old was brought in to provide cover for Szczesny, but Wenger insists that performances will dictate who claims the position.

'You know at the start Szczensy will be 
the No. 1, then again we'll be down to performances and, if Ospina shows
 that he is better, he will play,' he said.

Ospina will join Alexis Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy as new signings at the Emirates next season, while the club has also been linked with a move for Porto's £35 million-rated defensive midfielder William Carvalho.

Wenger believes that Arsenal can now compete at the highest level of the transfer market to mount a sustained challenge for the Premier League title this season.

Speaking at a press conference ahead of his side's pre-season friendly with New York Red Bulls, Wenger agreed that Arsenal were looking to repeat the success they have enjoyed in the past.

'That's what our target is but still I think we have been very consistent," he said.

'It was a very different period because we built a new stadium and had to pay it back. We survived at the top level but we want more.

'We are now on an even ground with the other clubs than we were five or six years ago.'
