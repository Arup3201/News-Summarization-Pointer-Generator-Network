Police have launched an investigation after a 15-year-old boy was this morning found dead in an alleyway of unknown causes.

Leon Cudworth was found by a passer-by in a litter-strewn side street in Oldham, Greater Manchester, on Saturday, police said.

Officers also said that a post mortem into his death had been inconclusive.

Grim: Officers were called to reports of a body discovered off Ripponden Road in Oldham at 8am, police said

Tributes have been paid to the teenager as police launch an investigation to discover how he died.

Teigan Heselwood wrote: 'RIP Leon, you were amazing! Can't believe you've actually gone! Just shows God only takes the best! You're with the angels now, love and miss you millions baby! Rest in paradise.'

Stacey Campbell wrote: 'RIP. So young, thoughts are with his family and friends.'

Alex Burbidge wrote on Facebook: 'Literally one of my best mates, Iâ€™m missing you like hell already.

'From all the boys, we love you and thereâ€™s not a day you wonâ€™t be in our hearts.

'That hug you gave me when I was with you last night will be the most important memory I will ever treasure, love you big man.'

Rhiannon Murphy said: 'RIP Leon, my thoughts go out to your family and friends. You were a lovely lad.'

Chief Superintendent Chris Sykes, from 
Greater Manchester Police, said there was nothing to suggest any 
wrong-doing at this stage but police 'cannot rule out third party 
involvement'.

Forensic investigators had today cordoned off the spot where the boy was found, erecting a tent to prevent the weather hampering efforts to gather evidence.

Adele Mills, who works in nearby Taylor's Bakers, said the body was spotted by a neighbour when they opened their curtains this morning.

She said: 'We got here just before 8.30am but our boss was already here - he got here about 5.30am and there was nothing there then.

'One of the residents up here has opened the back curtains and seen the body then notified police.'

Diane Woodhead, 40, whose home is just a few doors down from the alleyway, said: 'It's certainly a shock, it's not every day there's a body found at the back of your house.'

Police crime scene investigators get tools from their van:  Investigators were fighting strong winds and damp conditions in their efforts to ascertain just what happened to cause the boy's tragic and untimely death

Mr Sykes said: 'The death of this young man will be a big shock to the community and we have launched an investigation to find out the full circumstances of what happened.

'We are currently treating his death as unexplained. While there is nothing at this stage to suggest any wrong-doing, we cannot rule out any third party involvement, and we await the outcome of a post-mortem due to take place later today.

'We have increased our patrols in the area to offer reassurance to residents and would ask if anyone has any information or concerns that they come and speak to us.

'In particular we are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area overnight into the early hours of the morning on Saturday, February 15.

'If you saw or heard anything suspicious I would urge you to get in touch with police straight away.'
