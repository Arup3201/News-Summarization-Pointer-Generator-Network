George Clooney has taken striking British barrister Amal Alamuddin – who represents WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange - to meet President Obama at the White House, MailOnline can reveal.

In a move that will provoke yet more questions over his close friendship with the human rights lawyer, Oscar winner George, 52, took Miss Alamuddin to the private screening of his latest movie Monuments Men last week, in a group that included his parents Nick and Nina Clooney.

The stunning brunette is currently representing Assange - who has made no secret of his anger at President Obama's White House - in his extradition proceedings with Sweden.

The Oscar winner and the lawyer were 
said to be looking extremely close at the event, and although it's not 
known whether Miss Alamuddin met President Obama, Clooney is pictured 
standing by the Commander-in-Chief.

Just hours after the small screening on
 Tuesday, February 18, Clooney and Miss Alamuddin were pictured 
standing intimately together at the Round Robin and Scotch Bar at the 
Willard Hotel in Washington D.C. in a group that included Clooney’s pal and 
co-star Matt Damon and his wife Luciana, and fellow actor and co-star Bill Murray.

An onlooker at the bar told MailOnline: 'They looked very much together, George had his arm around her and she appeared to be a girlfriend.

'They were in a small group of about 10 people, it's really a small venue and there were maybe only about 30 people in the bar, and they were sitting at a table off to the side.

Bizarrely, the group can all be seen wearing mardi-gras style necklaces in the snapshot.

Miss Alamuddin was not on the official White House guest list that was issued last week.

However, in pictures seen by MailOnline, Miss Alamuddin - who donned a slinky black dress for the night - beams as she sips on champagne while having her hair done ahead of the screening, with Luciana Damon and Lysa Heslev looking on.

The presence of Julian Assange's lawyer 
in the White House, even on a movie star's arm for a private screening, 
is bound to have put the White House on tenterhooks.

Last June, Assange attacked President Obama and the White House in an open letter over its treatment of fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden.

When asked about Miss Alamuddin's presence at the screening, the White House press office had no official comment.

However,
 two White House sources told MailOnline that Miss Alamuddin came to the
 event with Clooney, according to their colleagues who were present.

One said she and Clooney were the 
talk of the junior staff on the next day since they had been seen 
cozying up to each other as they arrived, walking behind the star's 
parents, Nick and Nina Clooney.

The film follows an allied group, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, tasked with finding and saving pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler during World War II.

And the official guest list from the White House shows just what an intimate screening it was. Invited were Clooney, his parents NIck and Nina, Bill Murray, Matt Damon, Grant Heslov, Robert Edsel, writer of the book The Monuments Men and Harry Ettlinger, a surviving member of the original Monuments Men group.

Bill Burns, Deputy Secretary of State, was on the list as was Heather Higginbottom, Deputy Secretary of State and David Wade, State Department Chief of Staff. They were joined by Richard Stengel, Under Secretary of State for Public Affairs, Evan Ryan, Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs and Bill McHugh, Secretary of the Army.

Sara Bloomfield, Director the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, was invited as was Rabbi Jack Moline, Agudas Achim Congregation, Susan Hildreth, Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services and David Ferriero, Archivist of the United States

No romance, really? George Clooney denied dating Amal Alamuddin after the couple were pictured together at dinner in London in October. His spokesman said: 'He wants Amal to be able to prosecute cases without being hassled because she had one dinner with George and four others'.

Miss Alamuddin, who works from 
London's Doughty Street Chambers, specialises in international law, 
human rights, extradition and criminal law.  She speaks three languages -
 French, Arabic and English - and was voted No. 1 on London's Hottest 
Barrister list of 2013.

She
 has been appointed to a number of UN commissions including as adviser 
to Special Envoy Kofi Annan on Syria and her high profile human rights 
cases have included representing  former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.

She
 is currently representing Assange in his extradition proceedings with 
Sweden. The Australian hacker and rogue online publisher is currently wanted for questioning in Sweden in a sexual assault case.

When
 the UK’s Supreme Court turned down his appeal of an order to enforce 
the European arrest warrant against him, Assange fled to the Ecuadorian 
embassy in London. Ecuador granted him political asylum in June 2012.

If
 he should leave the embassy, the British government will likely send 
him to Sweden. From there, Assange fears, he could be extradited later 
to the United States to face even more fearsome charges.

His
 U.S. criminal case stems from his 2010 decision to publish a collection
 of American diplomatic cables – the largest cache of classified 
documents ever made public at once – on the WIkileaks website.

Assange
 received the material from Bradley Manning, an American soldier who was
 later convicted of violating the federal Espionage Act. A judge 
sentenced Manning last year to 35 years in Fort Leavenworth military 
prison, although he could be paroled in just eight years.

The
 day after his sentencing, the disgraced Army private announced that he 
had changed his name to Chelsea, and that he wanted to live as a woman.

From
 his sanctuary in the Ecuadorian Embassy, Assange wrote an open letter 
last June on the occasion of his first anniversary in hiding, slamming 
the Obama White House for its treatment of the fugitive NSA leaker 
Edward Snowden.

'The word "traitor" has been thrown around a lot in recent days,' Assange wrote. 'But who is really the traitor here?'

'Who
 was it who promised a generation "hope" and "change," only to betray 
those promises with dismal misery and stagnation? … Who is it that 
promised to preside over The Most Transparent Administration in history,
 only to crush whistleblower after whistleblower with the bootheel of 
espionage charges?’

Oscar winner Clooney and Miss Alamuddin were first pictured together after enjoying dinner at the Berners 
Tavern in London last October and then seen sharing a cab as they left 
the restaurant.

However, 
just days later, Clooney was at pains to stress he was still single 
after splitting with long-time love Stacy Keibler last summer.

After
 being linked with actress Katie Holmes and Croatian model Monika Jakisic as well as Miss Alamuddin, 
Clooney told People magazine in October: ‘Three different stories in three weeks. I
 should be an athlete. But, no of course, it's all made up.’

According to Clooney's spokesman, Stan Rosenfield, the actor finally felt moved to put a stop to the gossip.

‘George
 wants this Monika crap to stop. He wants Katie to get a break, and he 
wants Amal to be able to prosecute cases without being hassled because 
she had one dinner with George and four others … I even asked George if 
these [rumors] were true and he said he never comments on his private 
life, but in the interest of stopping the harassment of all three of 
these women, he felt he should.'

A source close to the actor 
added: "George is not dating, nor has he dated Monika in several years, 
nor is he dating Katie Holmes – he simply hugged her at a premiere – nor
 is he the new boyfriend of Amal, who he is working with on a 
[surveillance] satellite program over Syria.’
