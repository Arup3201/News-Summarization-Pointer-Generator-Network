In court: Deputy headteacher Gareth Williams, 47, of Cardiff, has pleaded guilty to 31 sex offences

A deputy headteacher who used a spy camera to film youngsters going to the toilet for sexual kicks also downloaded more than 16,000 child abuse images, a court heard today.

Gareth Williams, 47, of Cardiff, appeared at Newport Crown Court in South Wales to plead guilty to 31 sex offences.

They included eight offences of voyeurism relating to 'filming a person doing a private act in order to obtain sexual gratification', 21 counts of making indecent photographs of children and two of possessing child pornography.

Disgraced Williams was arrested earlier this year, where he confessed in court to three charges.

While he was remanded in custody, police carried out further investigations and uncovered more offences - dating from 2006 to January of this year.

Wearing a blue jumper, he today appeared via video link from HMP Parc in Bridgend where the remainder of the charges were put to him.

As each offence was read out, Williams kept his head bowed and answered ‘guilty’ to each count.

Prosecutor Michael Jones said the total number of indecent images found on ‘various devices’ came to 16,237 while South Wales Police’s hi-tech crime unit found a further 679 ‘voyeuristic files’ belonging to Williams.

The case was adjourned so the Probation Service can complete a detailed report on the defendant - which includes a psychiatric evaluation.

Judge Rhys Rowlands ordered for that report to be completed by May 15 - and sentencing would take place either the following day or after the weekend on May 19.

At an earlier hearing, magistrates were told Williams placed a pinhole camera in a house so he could look at the genitals of children as they went to the toilet. The school cannot be named for legal reasons.
