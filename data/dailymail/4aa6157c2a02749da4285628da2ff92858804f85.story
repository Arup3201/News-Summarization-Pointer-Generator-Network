Whilst most members of The Saturdays have been settling down and raising babies, one of its number is focused on taking her success up a notch by carving out a career in fashion.

Front row regular Mollie King, who has been quietly creating a new grown-up style for herself, has now been snapped up by High Street brand Oasis to be their first ever ambassadress.

Mollie has unveiled the 'Loved By Mollie' a/w13 collection - a 45-piece capsule range from the brand's new season styles that has been handpicked by the well-dressed singer.Scroll down for video

Fresh new face: The Saturday's Mollie King has been unveiled as the first ever ambassadress for High Street store Oasis

The clothing line, which lands in stores today, features the 26-year-old’s personal fashion favourites and includes oversized coats, fitted leather skirts, pretty pastels, and floral prints.

Speaking at an intimate dinner at the Soho Hotel last night, a spokesperson for Oasis told MailOnline that the collaboration was a ‘natural progression’ for the singer, who has championed the High Street label for years.

Model pooch: Mollie's pet pup, Alfie, also starred alongside her in the new campaign, which she said was 'so much fun'

Speaking about her exciting new venture, Mollie told MailOnline: ‘This is so exciting for me. I’ve always been an Oasis girl, it’s one of the few brands that suit my personal style and I’m a regular shopper.

‘For my first edit, I wanted to select key trend pieces for the season that I truly love but I had to be brutal as I wanted everything to be perfect.

‘I think I’ve chosen a perfect day-to-night selection and have had so much fun along the way.

‘I absolutely love the coats; my favourites are the camel and the black with faux fur snood.’

Mollie, who was dressed head-to-toe in her new edit, revealed that her beloved pooch, Alfie, joined her on the shoot – and even features on the new Oasis shopping bags.

‘It was so much fun working with Alfie but we did the shoot just as lunch arrived so he was trying to eat everything in sight,’ she told us.

Hash Ladha, Oasis COO said: ‘Mollie has always loved and worn our collection so we definitely feel she is the perfect, natural brand fit.

‘She embodies the spirit of the Oasis customer and has an effortless sense of style. Her “Loved By Mollie” edit is perfectly curated and we are excited to be working with her!’

The Surrey-born singer also stars in a new fashion film for the brand, which sees her giving style tips to a student who models some of the key looks.
