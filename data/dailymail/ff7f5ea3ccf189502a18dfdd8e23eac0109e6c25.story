While a blanket of mist shrouded parts of Britain's countryside this morning, autumnal light elsewhere captured the spectacular display of the season's vivid colours.

An early morning cold snap delivered beautiful scenes of a misty dawn during sunrise across parks in the country - a sign the bitter chill of winter is not too far away.

And the season's crimson and gold colours of turning leaves spectacularly framed the historic 17th century Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire.

Dog
walkers were pictured meandering in the autumn mist at dawn break at Hollow Pond in East London this morning.

Meanwhile, 300 yards out to sea off the coast of Northumberland at 
Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, a sculpture of a man and woman was pictured during sun rise.

The giant bronze figures standing on the new breakwater and looking out to sea, with birds seen flying in the horizon, created a striking image.

Elsewhere a Red Deer stag roared in the early morning light in Richmond Park, London - a sign of the start of the autumn 'Rutting' season.

During the season stags can be heard roaring and barking in an attempt to attract females known as bucks.

The larger males can also be seen clashing antlers with rival males.

The Met Office said Britain has been experiencing ‘very autumnal weather’ with places today seeing some cloud and patches of mist and fog.

Dan Williams, spokesman for the Met Office, said: ‘It is quite murky over a lot of areas and we are expecting a fair bit of cloud today.

‘Tonight we are expecting a band of rain to move up to through the south west of England over into western areas, with heavy rain and weather warnings  out for tomorrow for the western parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland.’

On Friday there is another set of 
weather warnings for eastern and northern Scotland and as high as 80mm 
of rain is expected on higher ground.

Mr Williams added: ‘Over the next few
days we won’t be experiencing the fairly cold frosty nights and below 
freezing temperatures that we have seen already.

‘Temperatures could drop as low as 2 
or 3 degrees but during the day it will be 14-16 degrees, with temperatures a bit 
cooler at the weekend.

‘We will stay with the autumnal theme over 
the weekend with some light showers, it will be a bit breezy and there will be some bright spells –
a typical autumnal mix.'
