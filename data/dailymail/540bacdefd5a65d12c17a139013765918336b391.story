This is the shocking CCTV footage which shows a BMW heading towards two toddlers being pushed in buggies by their fathers.

The heart-stopping image shows the moving car just metres away from the group, who were waiting at the crossing of a busy road junction in Leicester with their fathers.

One-year-old Oliwier Baczyk was killed at the scene and two-year-old Zofia Tabaka died later after they were thrown into the air by the impact.

This CCTV footage captures the second ahead of the collision which killed the two youngsters. The BMW car, circled right, can be seen heading directly towards the two buggies, circled left

It is believed the BMW hit a Mini Cooper before mounting the kerb and hitting the youngsters but it is not yet clear what caused the crash.

Two pedestrians, who were with the children at the time of the crash, are believed to their fathers. Both men, aged 29 and 28, suffered minor injuries.

A 40-year-old woman and a 61-year-old
man were arrested in connection with the incident, which happened at 
the junction of Narborough Road and Braunstone Gate in Leicester at 
9.52am yesterday.

They have since been released on police bail pending further inquiries.

A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said the accident involved a dark BMW and a red Mini Cooper.

Businessman Bob Young, whose CCTV cameras captured the crash, said: 'They were waiting for the lights to change when the BMW hit the Mini and it careered off the road, mounted the kerb and crushed the kiddies.'

Floral tributes and messages have already begun flooding in at the scene where the tragic collision happened.

Builder Dave Marsh, 38, told yesterday how he tried to save the two children after witnessing the crash.

He said: 'We were working on the shop front and the window was out and we heard an almighty smash.

'We looked out and this BMW had gone into the pedestrian lights where people wait to cross.

'We could hear this man screaming. I 
ran over and the first thing I saw was the baby boy on the floor. I 
shouted "somebody get an ambulance".

'He was just like a rag doll, he wasn't moving at all. He was lying awkwardly and had been knocked clean out of the pushchair.

'He was bleeding a lot, he had a nasty crack on his head.

'Other people had got to the little girl so I stopped with the little boy and held his hand and tried to make him comfortable.

Tributes to the two children, one who died at the scene and another who died later in hospital, have already been left at the scene

Flowers and cards with messages of condolence have been left at the scene following the tragic news of the toddlers' deaths

'Other people got coats and blankets to put over him to keep him warm.

'Someone who knew first aid came over and checked him.

'He was still breathing and I stopped with him until the paramedics arrived.

'When I got there, the father was sitting on the floor in a dazed shocked state.

'The mother arrived when all the paramedics were there and she went with them in the ambulance.

'She has been back with some flowers today with some of the family and the police.

'It's absolutely tragic really. If they were three steps back then they would have been fine.'

Karzan Nasroullah, who runs a car wash 20 yards from the scene, said he heard a loud bang as he arrived for work.

He added: 'I looked round and saw two men and two little children lying in the road.

'I
was stunned at first, then walked towards the children. It was awful to
see. A woman came out of a shop with blankets, then the ambulance and 
police arrived.'

Another 
trader, Bob Young, said: 'It’s awful what happened. Everyone is very 
upset. Builders working in a nearby shop ran to help, they didn’t 
hesitate for a moment.

'They were magnificent. They helped the injured the best they could until the ambulances arrived.'

Police appealed for information to try to find out the exact circumstances of what happened.

Detective Sergeant Mark Watling, of 
the force’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'If anyone 
witnessed the incident or the events leading up to it and have not yet 
spoken to the police we would urge them to contact us.'

Anyone with any information is asked 
to contact Leicestershire Police on 101 or, alternatively, contact 
Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
