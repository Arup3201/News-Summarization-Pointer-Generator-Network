An otherwise dull congressional hearing heated up briefly on Friday, as a Florida congressman told the top Health and Human Services 'preparedness' official she should quit, before ranting about the chance of contracting Ebola from a dirty airplane – and then abruptly leaving to catch a flight.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee heard testimony from a panel that included HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Nicole Lurie, two Pentagon officials and the Homeland Security Department's inspector general. 

Lurie gamely kept a straight face.

'Yeah, the plane! They've been on the plane,' snapped Rep. John Mica. 'They might have barfed on the plane!'

Dr. Nicole Lurie, the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, sat puzzled while the congressman leapt from topic to topic and wondered aloud about who's in charge

'These people are coming by planes,' said GOP Rep. John Mica of Pennsylvania. 'When some plane comes in from Africa, or transits through and has passengers from there, what are we doing with it? The plane?'

'With the plane itself?' a puzzled Lurie asked.

'Yeah, the plane! They've been on the plane,' snapped Mica. 'They might have barfed on the plane, there might be excrement, there may be vomit, there may be body fluids.'

'There are protocols for cleaning the plane,' offered Lurie.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention insists that Ebola is transmitted only through contact with bodily fluids. In some cases, however, the deadly contagion can remain alive on inert surfaces for a period of minutes.

Mica explained that his concerns stemmed from a global avian influenza crisis nearly a decade ago.

'I want to know the protocols are there in place! I've seen the equipment that we have, and the Centers for Disease Control actually got some of them,' he told Lurie.

'It's a heating device that heats the plane to 140 degrees to kill the germs, and that's what we used in the bird flu. Are we doing anything like that to make sure those planes aren't little Ebola transporters?'

After a brief pause, Lurie shifted gears.

'Mr. Mica, you sound upset, and I'm sorry for that,' she said. 'But we will make sure you get the protocols for cleaning the plane.'

'I'm not upset!' Mica insisted. 'I'm a happy boy.'

Forget about screening the passengers: what about the planes? Mica flipped out at the idea that the Ebola virus could hop from a person to an airplane or lavatory seat and then onto another passenger

Lurie had told the committee in her opening statement that 'Ebola is a dangerous disease, but there is hardly a reason for panic. There is an epidemic of fear, but not of Ebola, in the United States.'  

'"This isn't a panic. It's to be prepared",' Mica parroted back to her.

Tom Lehrer, 1959

When Pennsylvania Republican Rep. John Mica referred to 'Be Prepared' as 'The Boy Scout's marching song,' his unique choice of words pointed to a 1953 song by humorist Tom Lehrer (video below) about how a scout can fulfill his motto by carrying condoms and hiding his marijuana stash: 

Keep those reefers hidden where you're sure that they will not be found / And be careful not to smoke them when the scoutmaster's around,

For he only will insist that they be shared.

Be prepared!

---  

If you're looking for adventure of a new and different kind / And you come across a Girl Scout who is similarly inclined,

Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared.

Be prepared!

Grabbing a copy of a Homeland Security inspector general report that found stockpiles of equipment and medicines that could be helpful in fighting Ebola had been allowed to expire or fall into disrepair, he fixed his gaze on Lurie.

'Now, are you in charge of being prepared?' he asked.

'I am in charge of being prepared,' Lurie repied.

'Okay, then I think you need to turn your resignation in. Have you read this report? Have you read this report about preparedness that the IG – do you have some authority over preparedness?'

Lurie told him that as an HHS official, she has no authority to oversee disease preparedness measures undertaken by another cabinet agency.

'Then you don't have the authority to do the job?' a near-manic Mica sputtered. 'Who has the authority to do the job? ... Is that your job or somebody else's?' 

'You told me you're responsible for preparedness,' he shouted minutes later. 'Now if that's not your responsibility, is it the new guy's?'

Mica was referring to White House Ebola Response Coordinator Ronald Klain, and made his point with a colorful reference to a 1950s song by humorist Tom Lehrer about a Boy Scout packing condoms and hiding his marijuana.

'Does he have the ability to go in and make certain that we are prepared? It hasn't hit here yet. But what you want to do is be prepared' – '"the Boy Scout's marching song, Be Prepared",' he said.

Lurie  managed to crack only a single momentary smile.

As he finished his interrogation, Mica got up to leave while the hearing continued. 

'I have a plane to catch,' a room microphone picked him up saying. 

'Have a safe flight,' offered committee chair Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican. 'It'll be about your twelfth in four days.'
