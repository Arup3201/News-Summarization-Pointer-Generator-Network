A music teacher has lost a staggering 11st over the past year, after being inspired by his mother.

When his mother and father both lost weight as part of their recovery from life threatening illnesses, Simon Router, 38, from Luton, was inspired to address his own size.

At his worst eating upwards of six takeaways a week, Simon’s weight had reached 28st by the time his father Trevor, 67, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2012.

Simon at his heaviest weight of 28st (pictured) would often eat up to six takeaways a week 

Simon, who used to eat three sandwiches for lunch alone, split several pairs of trousers at his largest 

Simon was ultimately inspired to lose weight after seeing his mother Valerie not only survive cervical cancer but also lose 7st (Simon and Valerie before their weight loss, left, and today, right) 

As he underwent radiotherapy to shrink the tumour, Simon’s mother Valerie, 62, discovered she had cervical cancer and began chemotherapy.

During his recovery Trevor began to exercise with a trainer suggested to his through the Stroke Association, and as well as aiding his recovery, saw him lose 2st.

Valerie, who has now been given the all-clear, also began to use the personal trainer allocated to Trevor during his rehabilitation process, dropping an incredible 7st.

Seeing his parents, who had been overweight for years, turn their fight for life into an opportunity to improve their overall health and lose the excess weight, gave Simon the inspiration he needed to tackle his own eating issues.

‘I had known for years my weight was a problem. I’d split a few pairs of trousers over the years but was very very lucky I hadn’t had any major health problems from my size.

‘I had a really tough summer, with both my mum and dad becoming ill. It was one thing after another and I finally though enough is enough.

Simon, having completed the swimming portion of a triathlon, lost the weight through a rigorous exercise regime and by totally overhauling his diet 

‘Watching my mum’s amazing recovery was so inspirational for me, and I was soon booking up her trainer to help me with my weight loss.

Simon’s personal trainer quickly put him onto a high protein, low carbohydrate diet which alongside his rigorous exercise regime helped him to lose such a substantial amount of weight.

In total Simon has now lost 11st, dropping from 28st to 17st.

‘My health and fitness are through the roof. I just completed the HSBC relay triathlon and I’m doing a sprint triathlon in two weeks.

In total Simon has now lost 11st, dropping from 28st to 17st (pictured) and hopes to lose more as he continues his training 

‘With all the extra training for that I’m guessing I’m going to lose another few kilos. The weight is just falling off me.

A key factor in helping Simon with his new diet and weight loss programme was his use of protein supplements.

‘My personal trainer recommended I try out the PhD Nutrition whey protein shake range which helped me to re-build my protein levels after a hard training session,’ he explains.

Breakfast: Big bowl of cereal, typically crunchy nut cornflakes

Snacks: Several sausage rolls 

Lunch: Two or three Tesco sandwich meal deals consisting of a sandwich, crisps or chocolate bar, and drink

Dinner: A takeaway like fish and chips

 

Breakfast: 3 boiled eggs, 2 rashers grilled bacon, 2 grilled tomatoes, grilled mushroom, banana, apple, pint of water and a green tea

Snacks: PHD Diet Whey protein shake

Lunch: Grilled chicken breast, peas, carrots

Snack: Nuts and fruit

Dinner: Grilled chicken and veg. Plus another shake after training 

‘The shakes also worked as the perfect alternative to snacks; where I would usually grab a chocolate bar, or a bag of crisps, I instead made a PhD Belgium chocolate shake which, staved off my hunger and gave me the chocolate kick I was craving.’

Simon’s mother and father –whose tumours growth has been successfully stopped by radiotherapy- are continuing their own new healthy lease on life.

‘They are incredibly proud of what I have achieved,’ Simon says.
