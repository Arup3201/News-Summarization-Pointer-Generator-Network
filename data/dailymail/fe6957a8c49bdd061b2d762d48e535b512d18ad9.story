Anyone suspected of being a potential sex offender could have their internet use curbed and be banned from spending time with children without ever being convicted of an offence.

Sexual Risk Orders will be handed to anyone who 'poses a risk of sexual harm' in Britain or overseas and will last for at least two years.

Ministers said it was vital to making it easier for police to monitor sex offenders and would mean the UK has some of the toughest powers in the world.

Under the new regime police or National Crime Agency (NCA) officers will be able to apply to the magistrates' courts for a new Sexual Risk Order aimed at limiting the activities of individuals who they judge to be a risk but have not charged with an offence.

A range of restrictions can be applied to individuals under the powers, such as limiting their internet use, stopping them from being alone with a child under 16 or preventing travel abroad.

And breaching the order could see a person jailed for up to five years.

Policing and criminal justice minister Damian Green said: 'The UK has some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders.

'Today, we are going even further by giving police and National Crime Agency officers the power to place greater restrictions on any person they judge to be a risk.

'Our proposals support the Childhood Lost campaign to tighten the law on sex offenders and make it easier for police to monitor them.

'This is part of ongoing work by the Home Office led national group to look at how the police and other agencies can better identify and deal with sexual offending, ensuring victims are at the heart of the criminal justice system.'

The proposals, tabled in the Antisocial Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, also include a new Sexual Harm Prevention Order which can be applied to anyone convicted or cautioned for a sexual or violent offence, including where offences are committed overseas.

The Sexual Harm Prevention Order lasts a minimum of five years and has no maximum duration, while the Sexual Risk Order lasts a minimum of two years and has no maximum duration.

Both orders will have a lower risk requirement and their remit will be wider, meaning foreign travel restrictions can be applied.

The new measures replace orders that can currently be imposed on sex offenders who have been convicted, cautioned, warned or reprimanded for an offence or those who pose a risk.

Individuals will be able to appeal against the order and the police or the person concerned are able to apply for the order to be varied, renewed or discharged.
