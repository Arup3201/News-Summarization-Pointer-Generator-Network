Victim: Three-year-old Joseph Seevaraj died of tonsillitis after a 'gross failure' by an out-of-hours GP service

With his thick, dark hair and big brown eyes Joseph Seevaraj was the most angelic-looking little boy.

The energetic three-year-old loved nothing more than giggling his way through his favourite film,

Madagascar — a cartoon tale about a gang of zoo animals who escape captivity.

But today, his ability to deliver a convincing — ‘almost scary’ — impression of a lion can only be a cherished memory for his parents Jean and Nicola Seevaraj.

Because at the age of three years, one month and 19 days, Joseph died of tonsillitis: a death that could, and should, have been avoidable if not for a terrible failure by a German-born and trained out-of-hours GP.

‘If we had been able to see our own GP, who knew us, he would have known whether we were over-anxious parents or whether we had a legitimate concern,’ says church minister Jean, 37, of Hove, near Brighton.

‘If we had been able to speak to our family GP that weekend, I believe Joseph would still be alive.’

The family’s story is a damning indictment of failings in the out-of-hours system — raising particular concerns about the reliance of private providers on foreign doctors, who may have language difficulties and who may not have trained in the UK.

It was in January 2008 that Joseph began to suffer with the symptoms of a cold. The family visited their GP and Joseph was treated for conjunctivitis, but a couple of days later, he was still very unwell.

‘He had foul breath and when I looked on the internet I saw it could be a symptom of tonsillitis,’ says Jean. ‘When I looked in his mouth there were white spots on his throat, another symptom, so I called the GP, but there was a message saying that because it was out-of-hours — it was a Saturday — to call Brightdoc.’

Jean duly phoned the service, part of South-East Health Ltd, which was formed in 2006 following the merger of two smaller out-of-hours providers.

After speaking to a nurse and later a doctor, the worried parents took Joseph to an out-of-hours medical clinic at Royal Sussex County Hospital, also run by Brightdoc. They did so, and he was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics.

The couple took their son home, but the next day he began vomiting and suffering with diarrhoea, symptoms they now know can be an indication of blood poisoning, a rare complication of severe tonsillitis.

Concerned, they rang Brightdoc that evening. Jean relayed Joseph’s symptoms and was told a doctor would call back. It was 11pm when Dr Tilo Schippers phoned.

Jean told the doctor — who trained in Germany — he was concerned his son was dehydrated and unable to retain the drugs. He asked if he should take him back to hospital.

But Dr Schippers — who, Jean says, 
seemed to struggle to understand some of what he was saying — insisted 
there was no need to panic.

Jean will never know for sure whether language difficulties had an impact on the doctor’s decision to tell him not to worry, that it wasn’t necessary to take Joseph for further medical treatment. But privately he suspects there was an issue.

‘Whether or not he fully understood me, I’m not sure,’ he recalls.

‘I do know that I struggled to get my point across about Joseph’s condition, whether that was because of difficulties understanding the language or because he was at the end of a shift, probably a long one, I don’t know. But I do know that at the coroner’s inquest questions had to be re-asked and rephrased several times for him to fully grasp what was being asked.

‘If there is an issue with language, then that person should not be taking calls from patients where they have nothing to rely on other than what is being communicated verbally to them.’

But then, the couple had no reason not to put their faith in the doctor. ‘He was a professional,’ Jean says. ‘We assumed he knew what he was doing.’

Reassured, they settled Joseph in a travel cot in their bedroom and hoped that his condition would improve by morning.

‘We moved him into our room because we wanted him close at hand,’ says Jean. ‘The last time I saw him alive was at 3.30am. I gave him a bath because of his diarrhoea, and then put him in his cot . . .’

Jean woke to the piercing sound of his wife’s screams at 7.30am.

‘She was frantic,’ he says. ‘I knew something terrible had happened. Joseph’s eyes were open, but he wasn’t responding to anything she did. It was the worst moment of my life.’

At an inquest into their son’s death, a coroner said Joseph had died because of a ‘gross failure’ by the out-of-hours GP to provide basic medical attention. She criticised him for failing to take proper notes, and for, fatefully, flouting guidelines that state a patient who has contacted the service three times and is continuing to deteriorate should be assessed in person.

The inquest was told that had Joseph been taken to hospital, the septicaemia that claimed his life could have been treated.

For Jean and Nicola, who have three daughters and a baby son, the ordeal of Joseph’s death continues with the knowledge that Dr Schipper, who left the UK after their little boy’s death, returned in 2010 and has been able to continue working here, despite the coroner’s coruscating remarks.

‘There are clearly still holes in the out-of-hours system,’ says Jean. ‘I sincerely hope lessons can be learned so no other family has to go through such a devastating experience.’
