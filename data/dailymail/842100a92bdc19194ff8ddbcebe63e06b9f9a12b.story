Two Little Boys, by convicted paedophile Rolf Harris, was included in a Radio Times Christmas number one poll

Radio Times chiefs have come under fire for including a Rolf Harris song in a poll to find the nation's favourite Christmas number one.

The convicted paedophile's 1969 hit Two Little Boys, which topped the charts for six weeks, was withdrawn from the magazine's online vote after bosses admitted their mistake.

Readers had demanded the removal of the song, as victims called for a boycott of 84-year-old Harris' works.

Tonya Lee, who was abused by Harris when she was 15, told The Sun: 'I absolutely support the removal of Rolf's songs, art, TV shows or anything that he has been involved in.

'I would let any organisation know that using any of this is supporting a paedophile and supporting his disgusting behaviour.

'If any companies support Rolf or those of his ilk, I encourage the public to take a stand and boycott the product or publication.' 

The Radio Times poll, launched on November 28, included the likes of Boney M's Mary's Boy Child, Do They Know It's Christmas by Band Aid and Slade's Merry Xmas Everybody.

It is not known if the song, about two boys who grow up to fight in a war, received any votes.

Among the festive chart-toppers was the song by Harris, who was jailed for five years and nine months earlier this year for 12 indecent assaults against four girls - including one aged just eight - between 1968 and 1986.

Two Little Boys, which was re-recorded in 2008 to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of the First World War, was Harris' only UK number one and was Margaret Thatcher's favourite song.

He gave an impromptu live a cappella performance of the song at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 while Stevie Wonder's band was preparing. Lenny Henry was booed by the crowd for cutting Harris' second verse short.

Radio Times admitted the song was included by mistake.

A spokesman said: 'We thought it was inappropriate to include a recently convicted sex offender on the list.'

Harris is serving a prison sentence of five years and nine months for 12 indecent assaults against four girls, including one aged just eight, between 1968 and 1986
