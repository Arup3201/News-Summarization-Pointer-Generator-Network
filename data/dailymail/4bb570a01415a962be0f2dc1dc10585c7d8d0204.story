The trial of six young Iranians accused of 'hurting public chastity' after they danced around to Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy for a YouTube video has started in Tehran. 

Amnesty International UK's Head of Campaigns, Champa Patel, condemned the trial and told MailOnline: 'Arresting people for dancing in a video tribute to a song called Happy is taking things to a new level of dark irony even for the authoritarian Iranian authorities.

'Iran already stamps all over freedom of expression, banning the use of satellite dishes, filtering the internet, and jailing journalists, artists and film directors. The authorities should stop persecuting these people and drop this ludicrous case against them.'

Veiled: The three women from the video were seen veiled in the interrogation footage

The friends were arrested in May after police took offense at the video, which shows three men and three unveiled women dancing in the streets and on the rooftops of Tehran.

A description for the video said: 'We have made this video as Pharrell Williams' fans in 8hrs, with iPhone 5S. 'Happy' was an excuse to be happy. We enjoyed every second of making it. Hope it puts a smile on your face.' 

Williams protested the arrests on Facebook, posting: 'It is beyond sad that these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness.' 

The video titled 'Happy in Tehran' features the group dancing in various locales just as in the original and is one of hundreds of covers of the hit made by fans around the world.

But after the video hit YouTube and racked up close to 200,000 views with the help of Western news sites like the Huffington Post, authorities hunted down its stars, interrogated them in footage seen across the country and threw them in jail, though they were later released on bail.

'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia according to the ISNA news agency.

Dismay: Pharrell expressed his sadness at the arrest of the young Iranians

The Grammy award winning singer weighed in on the controversy.

'It's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness,' Pharrell tweeted, with a link to a New York Times blog story about the arrests.

The arrests came despite the three men and three women trying to dial back their fame by setting their video to private when they realized it had angered Islamic authorities.

'Following a series of intelligence and police operations and after coordinating with the judiciary, all the suspects were identified and arrested,' said Sajedinia.

Their interrogations showed the women veiled and angry officers asking questions. Sajedinia said they 'confessed to their criminal acts.' 

Islamic law stipulates that women must cover themselves in public. The video appears to show three women dancing exuberantly to the hit on Tehran rooftops, sans headress.

The move came at a perplexing time since Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke publicly in support of loosening the state's cencorship of the internet.

'We ought to see (the Internet) as an opportunity. We must recognise our citizens' right to connect to the World Wide Web,' said Rouhani according to the official IRNA news agency.

'Why are we so shaky? Why have we cowered in a corner, grabbing onto a shield and a wooden sword, lest we take a bullet in this culture war?' he said in a speech earlier this year.

He also posted a message that appears to offer support for the accused: 'Happiness is our people's right. We shouldn't be too hard on behaviours caused by joy.'

In an interview with IranWire in April prior to the arrests, one of the women explained that the video was meant as a celebration of Iran and to show that young people there have fun like they do anywhere.

'Despite all the pressures and limitations,' she said, 'young people are joyful and want to make the situation better. They know how to have fun, like the rest of the world.'
