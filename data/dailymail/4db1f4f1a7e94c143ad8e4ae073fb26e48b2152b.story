With her long blonde hair, perfectly made-up face and petite frame, Natasha Payne, 51, looks every inch the glamorous athlete.

But her looks don't tell the whole truth. Less than eight years ago, she was living the life of a naval officer under the name she was born with - David.

Now living as a woman with her girlfriend Mary Watson, 26, in Newcastle, Ms Payne says her life has changed for the better which has allowed her to pursue another passion - for pole-dancing.

New lease of life: Natasha Payne, 51, says she is overjoyed by the success of her pole-dancing career

Indeed, so good is Ms Payne, she took bronze for Team GB in the over-50 category at last year's World Pole-Dancing Championships.

'I competed as a woman against dancers from all over the world,' she reveals in an interview with Closer magazine. 'I was amazed when I won bronze - I'd come a long way from the confused boy I used to be.'

Ms Payne's life has changed immeasurably since coming out as transgender in 2008. After joining the navy and marrying aged 27, she went on to have a son and, outwardly at least, appeared to be living a happy, normal life as a devoted husband and father.

But when Ms Payne, who says she had always felt trapped in the wrong body, plucked up the courage to tell his wife of his feelings, things began to go wrong.

'She was shocked but sympathetic,' she says. 'It was hard for her to accept and the relationship broke down three years later.'

After leaving the Navy in 1999, she remarried but her new wife was uncomfortable with her desire to live as a woman and in 2008, the couple divorced.

Single once more, Ms Payne decided the time had come to begin living as a woman full time - a decision that her McDonalds manager girlfriend Mary completely supports.

Miss Watson also encouraged her to begin pole-dancing - a move which, says Ms Payne, has since given her confidence a real boost.

'I began going to classes to keep fit and I loved it so I started performing in local clubs,' she enthuses. 'The response was amazing - I had straight men flirting with me.'

Delighted: She says she is thrilled at her success and says it has given her a huge confidence boost

Four years on, Ms Payne's pole-dancing career is going from strength to strength and she says she's never been happier.

'Mary is proud of my dancing and comes to watch me sometimes,' she says. 'My son has seen me perform too and supports me because he knows it makes me happy. I hope it'll become an Olympic sport.'

And if it does, Ms Payne's name will undoubtedly be the first on the team sheet.
