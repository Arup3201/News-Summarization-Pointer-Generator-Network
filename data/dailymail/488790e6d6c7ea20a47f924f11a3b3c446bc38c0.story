These vintage photographs capture a lost New York City, where streetcars barreled down Third Avenue, the Empire State Building was the tallest in town - and five cents could get you a a bag of fresh-roasted peanuts.

Taken by legendary photographer Todd Webb in 1946, the collection of black and white images show the bustling docks of Manhattan, the skyline prior to its ever-rising glass-walled skyscrapers - and the people who called the city home.

Webb was about 40 years old when he set out on foot around the city with his camera, having just returned from a posting as a Naval Photographer in the Second World War.

Daily Mail online sent out photographer Edwin Torres to replicate present day photos of Todd Webb - and revealed where the Big Apple has undergone incredible transformation in the past 70 years - and where it has stayed, magically, unchanged.

On the docks: The East River docks were once thronged with trade ships like in this scene from the Fulton Fish Market Wharf. Today, the fish market is gone and South Street Seaport abandoned while work on a $1.5billion redevelopment project has stalled��

Right, the view of downtown Manhattan from the Empire State Building in 1946 and, left, the view in 2015 from the Empire State Building. Today's viewpoint is at a slightly higher angle as Todd photographed from the 49th floor which is now office space. The current observatory is on the 86th floor

As well as the iconic sights and architecture of the metropolis, Webb's images also took in locals around his Harlem neighborhood, and working folk in downtown Manhattan around Chinatown and the Battery Park.

The images have been dusted off from the archives and published in a limited-edition collection,21st Editions.

According to photography experts, Webb, who won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1955, was notable in getting to know the subjects of his portraits before shooting - sometimes spending days talking to people before taking a picture. 

In an introduction to the images, Harvard professor John Stauffer wrote how Webb was also an unusual photographer for his time, taking an interest in picturing African-Americans and interracial friendships.

Although 1946 was blighted by the death of his mentor, photographer and modern art promoter Alfred Stieglitz, Webb - who died in 2000 - remembered it as one of best and most productive years.

Right, traders on Suffolk Street near Chinatown in downtown Manhattan. Although the store name in the 1946 picture is not visible, the 2015 shot reveals that Streit's has supposedly been open since 1925. And while transportation may have moved on from carts to forklifts, the street remains one-way, 70 years later

Right, the intersection at 2nd Avenue and East 50th Street shows the Chrysler Building, not yet surrounded by other Midtown high rises. Left, the Chrysler is obscured today by multiple tower blocks and the traffic now flows in one direction downtown

Old smokey days: This collection of photographs by Todd Webb has been republished - the above showing the New York City skyline in 1946, when the Empire State Building (right) and Chrysler building (center left) were still the tallest two structures in the metropolis

The photographer found these boys on a street in Harlem, and asked them to pose for him. Todd Webb often spent days coaxing subjects to be part of his iconic images 

Pals: This photograph, called 123rd Street (Boys with Toy Gun) shows a black child and white friends playing in Harlem. Webb's writings show how he despised racism - describing seeing 'Whites Only' signs on a visit to the segregated South 'hard to take'

This photo, called 'The Circle,' LaSalle at Amsterdam, shows a group of black and white children playing together around a burst waterpipe

Harlem scenes: These photographs a hat store in Harlem's 125th street, and the nearby offices of The People's Voice, a weekly black newspaper, with a local standing outside. The paper had just moved offices

Working man: Taken close to Battery Park in downtown Manhtattan, this image shows a local tradesman selling roasted peanuts on the street for five cents a bag

Fine motor: This image shows the car of Lamar Perkins, a prominent Harlem citizen and New York state's assistant attorney general

To Brooklyn: Todd Webb took this photograph the first time he walked over the Brooklyn Bridge - with only enough film for six frames. When he returned the next day with more, officials were enforcing a photography ban - so he had to turn back

The Brooklyn Bridge today looks much the same - but the still wooden path has been marked out for cyclists and walkers

The images show yesteryear NYC transportation, including the image to the left of the now-demolished Third Avenue El train metro line, with a street car running underneath. To the right, a photograph taken at the interaction of Second Avenue and 50th Street shows the Chrysler Building standing tall, not yet surrounded by other midtown high-rises

The intersection of Second Avenue and East 50th Street (which shows the same scene as above, right). The Chrysler building is now obscured by apartment blocks

From the docks: The photographs show how Manhattan's ports and piers still thronged with trade ships. This is the scene from the Fulton Fish Market Wharf

Today, the fish market is gone and South Street Seaport abandoned while work on a $1.5billion redevelopment project has stalled

Famous: This image, published in Fortune magazine, shows the view of downtown Manhattan from the Empire State Building - then the highest view in the city. The same vista would now be dominated by the World Trade Center's Freedom Tower

Today's viewpoint from the Empire State Building is at a slightly higher angle as Todd photographed from the 49th floor which is now office space. The current observatory is on the 86th floor

Towering: This photograph, taken at the intersection of Madison Street and Pike Street, shows the view south towards the Manhattan Bridge

Commerce: This image shows traders on Suffolk Street, near Manhattan's Chinatown. There are street markets, pushcarts parked end to end in front of the endless rows of small stores

This is the same location from Todd Webb's 1946 photograph on Suffolk and Hester streets where shoppers purchase goods from a street cart in front of the corner store

In 2015, many of the sights that Webb photographed have been erased or blocked by towering buildings
