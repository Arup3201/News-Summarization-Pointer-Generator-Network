The lawyer for Marion 'Suge' Knight says a video of a confrontation that ended in a fatal hit-and-run appears to show the former rap mogul was ambushed.

Attorney David Kenner says he briefly reviewed the video obtained from a Compton burger stand, Tam's Burgers, and claims that the footage supports Knight's claims that he feared for his life that January night.

Knight, 49, struck two men with his truck on Jan. 29 in the confrontation that left 55-year-old Terry Carter dead and Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan seriously injured.

'In my estimate, what some of the video shows is that Mr. Knight was called there as part of an ambush to kill him, and what he did in driving out in the manner and way in which he did was to avoid being killed,' Kenner told the New York Daily News.

He said that the alleged ambush involved five or more men and Knight left 'the only way he could without being killed.' 

Kenner said Wednesday that his firm has only had one day with the video but believes it will aid Knight's defense of murder, attempted murder, and hit-and-run charges.

The attorney declined to discuss the video in detail, but TMZ reports that unidentified sources say the video shows Sloan -- whose foot was mangled in the incident -- pointing a gun at Knight shortly before the hit-and-run.

Sloan's lawyer told the Daily News that the gang member-turned filmmaker was not in possession of a firearm of any kind at the time of the incident and the report is inaccurate.

Police say that Knight never left the truck and appeared to intentionally hit the victims before fleeing the scene. 

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed that it has received video footage related to the incident, according to the Daily News, but could not comment on the video's details.   

Chest pains: Knight, pictured in court on Feb. 3, complained of having chest pains after his appearance and was rushed to the hospital where doctors discovered he had blood clots

Rap Sheet: Knight faces a long sentence in this case, and has a lengthy rap sheet spanning back to 1987

Knight remains in jail and has pleaded not guilty. 

The rap mogul was out on bail in a separate robbery case and after he was charged in the hit-and-run incident his $2 million bail was revoked as authorities believed he was a potential flight risk and could intimidate witnesses.

Tam's Burgers: The hit-and-run took place at Tam's Burgers (photographed) and was reportedly the result of an argument 30 minutes before between Knight and others on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton' 

Knight is the co-founder of Death Row Records, which once boasted Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg as its artists. 

Authorities say the hit-and-run was the result of an argument 30 minutes before between Knight and others on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton.'

Details about the video were first reported by TMZ.
