The Taliban immediately claimed responsibility for the blast in the city of Jalalabad, stating it was in revenge for the burning that has caused an outcry in Afghanistan, triggering a wave of demonstrations and killings.

About 40 people have been killed in protests and related attacks since the incident became known last Tuesday, including four U.S. soldiers - two gunned down by a supposedly trusted Afghan driver in a secure ministry in the heart of the capital Kabul.

Powerful: The bomber drove up to the gates of the airport - which serves both civilian and international military aircraft - shortly after dawn and detonated his explosives in a 'very strong' blast

NATO, France, Britain and the U.S. 
have pulled their advisers from Afghan ministries out of concern that 
the anti-foreigner anger might erupt again.

President Barack Obama has apologised
for the burning of Korans that had supposedly been used to pass 
messages between prisoners inside the giant US base at Bagram, 40 miles 
from Kabul.

In a bid to restore order, Afghan 
President Hamid Karzai has urged calm, calling on his countrymen not to 
allow insurgents to capitalize on their indignation to spark violence 
but protests and killings have continued.

High alert: Guards stepped up security after the attack, which insurgents said was revenge for U.S. troops burning copies of the Koran

Destruction: Among the dead were six civilians, two airport guards and one soldier. Another six people were wounded

The suicide bomber yesterday drove up
to the gates of Jalalabad airport, which primarily serves international
military aircraft, and detonated his explosives in a 'very strong' 
blast shortly after daybreak, said provincial police spokesman Hazrad 
Mohammad.

Among the dead were six civilians, 
two airport guards and one soldier, he said. Another six people were 
wounded, he said. At least four cars were destroyed in the blast.

NATO forces spokesman Capt. Justin 
Brockhoff said that no international forces were killed in the attack 
and that the base was not breached by the blast.

Afghan officials, including the 
defence and interior ministers, cancelled planned visits to Washington 
this coming week so they could remain in Kabul for consultations about 
how to quell the violence.

The Taliban has claimed 
responsibility too for the murder of the two US officers saying they 
were helped into the compound by supporters because of the outrage over 
the burning of the Korans. No one has yet been arrested for the 
killings.

Eight shots were fired at the men - two at the first victim and eight at the second, the official said.

The groundswell of anger over the 
burning of the Koran, which Muslims revere as the literal word of God, 
has highlighted the challenges ahead as Western forces try to quell 
violence and bring about some form of reconciliation with the Taliban.

The United Nations also scaled back 
its operations, moving its international staff from an office in the 
northern city of Kunduz that was attacked during protests Saturday, the 
organisation said in a statement.

The evacuation was ordered 'to put in
place additional arrangements and measures to make sure the office can 
continue to operate in safety,' the UN said, adding that the move is 
temporary and that staff will be relocated within Afghanistan.

Despite the pullback, the commander 
of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan said that the partnership with 
the Afghan government was as strong as ever.

'We are steadfast in our desire to 
support our Afghan partners, and will use the extensive range of our 
resources to eradicate this heartless insurgency,' General John Allen 
said in a statement condemning the Jalalabad bombing.

The incident prompted NATO, Britain and France to recall hundreds of international advisers from Afghan ministries.

The advisers are key to helping 
improve governance and preparing the country's security forces to take 
on more responsibility ahead of the drawdown of Western forces planned 
for 2014.

The U.S. Embassy warned of a 
'heightened' threat to American citizens in Afghanistan and many 
Westerners are on 'lock down', meaning they are not allowed out of their
fortified compounds.

'Tensions are running very high here.
I think we need to let things calm down, return to a more normal 
atmosphere, and then get on with business,' Ambassador Ryan Crocker 
said.

'This is not the time to decide that 
we are done here. We have got to redouble our efforts. We've got to 
create a situation that Al Qaeda is not coming back.'
