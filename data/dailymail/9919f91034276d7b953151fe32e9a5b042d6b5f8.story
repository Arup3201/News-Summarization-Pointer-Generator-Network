A British aid worker kidnapped in north east Afghanistan last month has been freed after a dramatic SAS rescue mission authorised by Prime Minister David Cameron.

Helen Johnston, 27, a nutritionist from Stoke Newington in London, Kenyan national Moragwe Oirere and two Afghan civilians were rescued during an early morning raid by members of the elite special forces unit.

All four hostages work for Medair, a humanitarian non-governmental organisation based near Lausanne, Switzerland and were kidnapped on May 22 in Badakhshan province.

Badakhstan: The hostages were held in a mountainous region close to the border with Tajikistan

Heroic: The SAS were helicoptered to the cave where the hostages were being  held and stormed it, killing the kidnappers and releasing all four captives alive

The dramatic raid took place at 1am in Shahr-e-Bozorgd district, in a large forested area near the Tajikistan border called Koh-e-Laran.

According to the Daily Telegraph, SAS soldiers, working with the ISAF's Joint Special Forces Group, were transported by helicopter to the cave where the hostages were being held.

They then stormed the cave and freed the hostages.

Mr Cameron confirmed all four 
hostages were rescued safely, no British troops were injured and five 
Taliban and hostage-takers were killed.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed: 'They are all now safe. Helen and Moragwa are receiving support from British Embassy staff in Kabul.

'The two Afghan aid workers are returning to their families in Badakhshan.'

It was recently revealed the SAS would stay on in Afghanistan after British troops withdraw in 2014

The Prime Minister spoke to Ms Johnston shortly after she arrived at the British Embassy in Kabul following the successful rescue attempt.

During their brief conversation she thanked Mr Cameron for efforts of all those involved in bringing her to safety.

The Prime Minister was told the operation had been a success at around 2am. He then stayed up to speak to military commanders on the ground and thank them for what they had done.

This morning he also spoke to the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Commander and Deputy Commander of ISAF in Afghanistan to thank them for their efforts.

The Special Air Service (SAS) is an elite special forces and counter terrorism unit of the British Army.

Based in Hereford, England, 'The Regiment' is widely regarded the best of its kind, the SAS has become the model for a number of special forces across the world.

It was constituted in 1950 and has been involved in every major conflict that Britain has taken part in since.

The SAS were first deployed in Afghanistan in 2001 
and have carried out covert work uncovering Taliban bomb factories and 
identifying the location of key enemy figures for air and ground 
attacks.

Their weapon of choice is the Canadian-made C7 rifle, which replaced the M16, and is ideal for close quarters combat.

Last month it was revealed the SAS 
will stay in Afghanistan after British troops withdraw in 2014, to 
conduct counter-terrorism operations against the remnants of Al Qaeda.

Speaking
 after learning of her rescue, Miss Johnson's parents Philip and 
Patricia said: 'We are delighted and hugely relieved by the wonderful 
news that Helen and all her colleagues have been freed.

'We
 are deeply grateful to everyone involved in her rescue, to those who 
worked tirelessly on her behalf, and to family and friends for their 
love, prayers and support over the last twelve days.

'We greatly appreciate the restraint 
shown by the media since her abduction, and ask that they continue to 
respect our privacy at this special time.'

The
 Prime Minister gave the go ahead for the rescue mission to take place, 
and said today such decisions were 'extraordinarily difficult' and 
'never rushed into'.

But he said he decided the risks to the workers' lives were getting greater.

He revealed he had spoken Ms Johnston's parents and brother, and the aid worker herself, adding: It's just a huge joy that they are finally going to be re-united and they are all healthy and all well.'

Mr Cameron also paid tribute to British troops involved in the rescue.

Revealing the mission involved a 'long route march" without being discovered, he said:

'It was an extraordinarily brave, breath-taking even, operation that our 
  troops had to carry out.'

'I pay tribute to their skill and dedication.'

'Above
 all, on this weekend of all weekends, we should say a enormous thank 
you to the incredibly brave forces that took part in this operation.

'We
 will never be able to publish their names but the whole country should 
know we have an extraordinary group of people who work for us who do 
amazingly brave things.'

Relieved: David Cameron gave the go-ahead for this morning's rescue of Helen Johnson, who had been working for a Swiss-based aid organisation

He added that the rescue should serve as a warning to terrorists across the world who take British citizens hostage.

'They should know if they take British citizens as hostage we do not pay ransoms, we do not trade prisoners,' he said.

'They can expect a swift and brutal end.'

The aid workers were abducted by a group of armed men during a visit to relief project sites in Badakhshan, Medair said.

 A British hostage was killed in Nigeria in March when an attempted rescue involving UK special forces ended in tragedy.

Chris McManus, working in the country as a building firm contractor, was killed alongside an Italian colleague as Nigerian troops and British Special Boat Service commandos launched a failed mission in west Africa.

The UK national had been held by terrorists associated with Islamist extremist group Boko Haram since May last year after being kidnapped from his apartment by gunmen.

Prime Minister David Cameron was criticised when it emerged that Italian authorities were not notified about the covert operation until it was under way.

Aid worker Linda Norgrove died during a mission to rescue her from hostage takers in Afghanistan in October 2010.

Ms Norgrove, 36, was killed by a grenade thrown by a US soldier during the operation, although Wiltshire coroner David Ridley did not blame him or his comrades for the tragic mistake.

Three Afghans captured with her were released unharmed a few days later.

Since the kidnapping, the charity kept a lid on publicity which it felt could jeopardise efforts to secure a release.

Spokesman Aurilien Demaurex said the aid workers would now be reunited with their families.

'We are really, really happy,' he said.

'Medair
 is relieved that our colleagues are safe. We are immensely grateful to 
all parties involved in ensuring their swift and safe return.

'The staff members are on their way 
to be reunited with their families. We ask the media to respect the need
 for the privacy of our employees and their families.

'Medair
 would like to thank everyone for their encouragement and support during
 this very difficult period. We are also very grateful for the 
overwhelming messages of support from local Afghan communities.'

According
 to its website, the organisation has worked in Afghanistan since 1996, 
providing relief to vulnerable and isolated communities.

Despite
 recent events, a spokesman said the charity was committed to continuing
 its work 'which relies on us working safely within local communities, 
wherever they may be.'

Before she was posted to Badakhshan, Miss Johnson studied at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine before her posting to Badakhshan.

She was interviewed by the Evening Standard last November about her work in the region.

Describing life in the region as 'gruelling' and physically tough, she said: 'It can be frustrating and hard, but there is no doubt that there is a 
fundamental need for us to be here. Too many children are suffering for 
us not to be.'

General John R Allen, commander of the International
Security Assistance Force, said the rescue mission showed the coalition's
commitment to defeating the Taliban.

'First, I would like to thank the Afghan Ministry of
the Interior and Minister Mohammadi for their tremendous support throughout
this crisis,' he said.

'Second, this morning's mission, conducted by coalition
forces, exemplifies our collective and unwavering commitment to defeat the
Taliban.

'I'm extremely grateful to the Afghan authorities and
proud of the ISAF forces that planned, rehearsed, and successfully conducted
this operation.

'Thanks to them, Ms Helen Johnston, Ms Moragwe Oirere,
and their two co-workers will soon be rejoining their families and loved
ones.'
