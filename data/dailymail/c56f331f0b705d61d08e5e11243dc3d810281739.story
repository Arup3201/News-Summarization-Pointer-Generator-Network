Iker Casillas claims to have learned from the  mistakes he made for Real Madrid and Spain towards the end of last season.

The goalkeeper was at fault for Atletico Madrid's goal in May's Champions League final and also made costly errors as Spain crashed out of the World Cup at the group stage this summer.

Ahead of Real's Super Cup clash against Sevilla on Tuesday, 33-year-old Casillas admitted his usual high standards had dropped.

'I haven't been at my best in the last few games for Real Madrid and Spain, but I have analysed and learned from them,' the stopper told Soccerway.

'I have been through worse moments in my career. You go through good moments and bad moments. Everything is temporary. I have not been at the level I was when maybe people became spoiled.

'You have to grin and bear it and face up to situations like this. I have always done so and I am not going to hide now.

'I understand that when you play for Real Madrid you are always being watched and your name is talked about when things are good and when they are bad.'

Attention: Casillas understands Real Madrid players will always be scrutinised playing well or badly
