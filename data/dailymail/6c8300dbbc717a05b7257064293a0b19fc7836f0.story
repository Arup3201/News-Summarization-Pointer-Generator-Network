The Obama administration said Monday that U.S. diplomats are working behind the scenes to make it difficult for NSA leaker Edward Snowden to find safe harbor in any of the nations that have offered him asylum.

Snowden has received a temporary travel document to fly to Caracas, Venezuela, and both Bolivia and Nicaragua have also offered him political asylum, but White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters during his regular briefing that the United States will do what it can to stop him.

'The United States has been in touch via diplomatic and law enforcement channels with countries through which Mr. Snowden might transit or which might serve as final destinations for Mr. Snowden,' Carney said.

U.S. diplomats, he added, have 'made very clear that he has been charged with a felony, or with felonies, and, as such, he should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than travel that would result in him returning to the United States.'

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden will be pursued no matter which country gives him safe harbor

It's not clear whether the Obama administration is hoping a Latin American nation will double-cross Snowden and offer him up to Washington after he arrives from Russia.

But the U.S., Carney said, is still working to persuade Moscow to short-circuit the process and turn the fugitive over before he can leave Moscow's Sheremetyevo-2 airport.

Still stuck: Edward Snowden made one of the biggest US intelligence leaks in history. His pleas for asylum have finally been accepted in three Latin American countries, but leaving Moscow is proving problematic

'While we don’t have an extradition treaty with Russia, we believe that there is a strong legal justification for Russia to expel Mr. Snowden, and given that he is wanted here on felony charges, that he should be returned to the United States,' Carney told reporters.

Russia, too, seems interested in finding Snowden a destination.

'He needs to choose a place to go,' insisted deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov.

But
sources say Snowden will not be allowed to board the only Aeroflot 
plane that offers direct connections to Caracas, a regular service to 
Cuban capital Havana.

The 
routing overflies both the EU and the US and there are fears the plane 
will be denied rights to Western airspace, and forced to land, leading 
to Snowden's arrest.

The direct distance from Moscow to Caracas is 6,175 miles but last night it appeared too far for Snowden.

Indeed, unless Russian secret services
actively connive with his escape by a clandestine route, it is looking 
hard to see how he can flee Russia.

'Venezuela
is waiting for an answer from Snowden. This, perhaps, is his last 
chance to receive political asylum,' said Russian MP Alexei Pushkov, 
seen as close to the Kremlin.

Otherwise his only option would be to remain in Russia and accept glamorous spy Anna Chapman's offer to marry him, he joked.

Venezuela
president Nicolas Maduro has vowed to  grant asylum to Snowden, to 
protect him 'from the global persecution of the empire', meaning the US. 

Sticky situation: Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has vowed to grant Snowden asylum, but getting to Caracas involves a logistical and political nightmare that the Obama administration is trying to make even more difficult

With
Russia getting publicly impatient with the US whistle-blower's presence 
in its transit zone, his escape route is a logistical nightmare.

'Instead
of going west to Venezuela, his obvious option is east to Vladivostok 
and then across the Pacific to Caracas,' said one source.

It would mean Russia allowing him to formally enter its territory, which so far it has refused to do, unwilling to upset the US.

Denied: An Aeroflot Airbus A330 plane heading to the Cuban capital Havana takes off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport July 6, 2013. Sources say Snowden won't be allowed onto the only direct flight to Caracas, via Havana, Cuba

Roundabout: Russia's Sheremetyevo airport outside Moscow where Snowden remains in flux. With a western flight blocked, he may have to fly 14,000 miles across the Pacific to reach Caracas

This
would also involve a 14,200 mile detour and a routing that would bring 
him close to the US state of Hawaii posing a risk to any private plane 
willing to take him on a route where there are no scheduled services.

'The
only solution is to smuggle him on board a military or diplomatic 
plane, but even then the US last week managed to ground the president of
Bolivia's plane when they thought Snowden was on board,' said another 
source.

President Evo Morales was subject to an humiliating delay at Vienna after his jet was refused permission to overfly the airspace of France, Portugal, Italy and Spain.

The Bolivian leader has since offered Snowden asylum as has Nicaragua.

That's about enough: Russian MP Alexei Pushkov has expressed the country's growing annoyance with, and unwillingness to tolerate, Snowden's presence

Halted: Bolivia's Evo Morales said he would grant asylum to Snowden. Morales and other Latin American leaders expressed outrage over the recent grounding of the president's plane, which the U.S. believed carried Snowden

Fighting the power: Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega confirmed his country received an asylum request from Edward Snowden and said he would grant it if 'the circumstances allowed it'

White House spokesman says Snowden has been 'charged ... with felonies, and as such he should not be allowed to proceed in any further travel'

Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua  has offered asylum, but his path to the Americas may force him across the Pacific to avoid U.S. and EU airspace

The 30-year-old also won't be allowed aboard the most direct flight from Moscow via Havana, Cuba
