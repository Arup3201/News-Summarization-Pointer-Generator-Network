The basketball star who led UConn to a decisive victory in the NCAA men's basketball championship last night has created as much buzz off the court as on it with his comments about college athlete poverty.

Senior Guard Shazbazz Napier is now being put forward as an outspoken critic of the treatment of college athletes, and critics say his experience is evidence of the need to overhaul the college system.

The athlete complained in a recent interview with Fox Sports that he is so poor he can't afford food beyond that offered by his school's cafeteria service. 

'We as student athletes get utilized for what we do so well. We are 
definitely blessed to get a scholarship to our universities, but at the 
end of the day, that doesn't cover everything,' Napier told FoxSports.

Critic: UConn's Shabazz Napier was named Outstanding Player as his team took the NCAA Championship. He has been outspoken in criticizing support for college athletes

Hungry: Napier scored 22 points in the game as well as taking six rebounds. He has complained he often goes to bed hungry because he can't afford food

'We do have hungry nights 
that we don't have enough money to get food and sometimes money is 
needed.'

'When
 you see your jersey getting sold -- it may not have your last name on 
it -- but when you see your jersey getting sold and things like that, 
you feel like you want something in return.'

'To some credit, you feel like you want something in returnâ€¦ Like I 
said, there are hungry nights that I go to bed and I am starving. So 
something can change, something should change,' Napier said.

And on Monday night as his team crushed the Kentucky Wildcats, Napier was still acknowledging his complaints.

'Ladies and gentlemen, you're looking at the Hungry Huskies,' said the man named Most Outstanding Player. 

'Two years and hungry. Hungry Huskies!'

Bright career ahead: This was Napier's last game as a college student

Celebration: Napier told the crowd they were the 'Hungry Huskies'

Local politicians supporting a move to unionize college athletes are putting him forward as an example of a need for action.

Last month, the National Labor 
Relations Board ruled that football players at Northwestern have the 
right to form the first ever labor union in college sports.

The ruling will now be voted on and the school is appealing the decision.

But it hasn't stopped campaigners who are now demanding a similar option for students at public universities like UConn.

Public schools are governed by state labor laws and therefore may face an additional legislative burden.

'He says he's going to bed hungry at a
 time when millions of dollars are being made off of him. It's obscene,'
 State Rep. Matthew Lesser said.

'This
 isn't a Connecticut problem. This is an NCAA problem, and I want to 
make sure we're putting pressure on them to treat athletes well.' 

Supported: Connecticut point guard Shabazz Napier, left, with head coach Kevin Ollie, said he sometimes can't afford food as a student athlete. His comments have been backed by local politicians

Last night Napier's criticism was being reconsidered in light of his success on the court.

In
 the final game of his college career there was never a moment in the 
game that the Huskies trailed Kentucky, taking their rivals down 60-54.

Napier scored 22 points and grabbed six rebounds while teammate Ryan Boatright drained 14 points and had three assists.

This is the fourth national championship for UConn. They have never lost a title game. 

The outspoken player also used his 
post-game interview to hit out at the NCAA's decision to ban his team 
from the 2013 postseason due to poor academic standing.

Should state law prove to be a barrier for Connecticut's college athletes to form unions at public schools, State Rep. Patricia Dillon said she would propose legislation to allow for their unionization.

'We shouldn't be preventing them. They should have that voice,' Dillon said. 'If state law is the barrier, then we should remove it. It 
should be up to the players.'

Dillon may not have a chance to introduce a bill this year as only four weeks remain in the legislative session.

Big change: Napier is hopeful efforts to form a student athlete union at Northwestern will lead to unions at other schools

UConn spokesman countered that Napier is given food as part of his athletic scholarship.

'Shabazz Napier, like all our scholarship athletes, is provided the 
maximum meal plan that is allowable under NCAA rules. UConn does not 
have a cafeteria devoted specifically to student-athletes, but they have
 access to the same cafeterias which are available to all our 
students,' Phil Chardis wrote.

The university's athlete handbook notes that students with a meal plan have access to all-you-can-eat dining facilities open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Lori J. Pelletier, leader of the state's labor union, believes there is good cause for a college athletes union. 

'Many of these athletes end up injured and no longer have the 
opportunity for an athletic career. These athletes deserve to be 
protected from career-ending injuries just as any 'worker' is covered. 
The ruling by the NLRB will allow for serious discussion on how we treat
 these performers,' the Connecticut AFL-CIO executive secretary 
treasurer wrote. 

Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations leaders said it has yet to be determined whether state law permits student athlete unions and that college athletes have yet to petition the board seeking a ruling.
