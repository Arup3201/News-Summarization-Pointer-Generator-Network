Thief: Amanda Mann, an estate agent lettings manager, denied 17 charges of theft involving £7,500. She spent some of the cash on breast reduction surgery and designer shoes

A woman who stole from her employers and spent some of the cash on breast reduction surgery and designer shoes has been jailed for two years and three months this morning.

Amanda Mann, an estate agent lettings manager, of Rhuddlan, near Rhyl, Wales, denied 17 charges of theft involving £7,500 but was previously convicted by a jury.

The prosecution alleged that she had been responsible for stealing a far larger amount - in the region of £90,000.

The judge, Mr Recorder Timothy Petts, told her today that he was convinced that she had stolen more than the amount in the charges, but it was impossible to say how much.

The trial heard how Mann, 43, spent money on Jimmy Choo shoes and on breast reduction surgery at a cost of £6,000.

Mold Crown Court was told today that she still denied any thefts, protested her innocence, and blamed others for taking the money.

Mann worked for Fletcher and Poole estate agents at Conwy and was promoted to lettings manageress ten years ago.

Most tenants paid in cash and Mann dealt with banking. She’d been regarded as a friend by her employer but there had been 'systematic siphoning off of money' which should have gone to the company.

Application fees paid by tenants had been stolen, commission fees paid by landlords hadn’t been passed on, and deposit payments had also vanished.

Mann had been suspended then sacked in 2011 and police called in.

Bank statements showed Mann had £17,000 debts but periodically deposited large sums of cash. She had lived in a flat above the office and paid £300-a-month rent in cash.

Owen Edwards, defending, said that his client had settled a £5,000 personal injury claim which could be used for compensation and said if she was allowed her liberty more money could be paid over from her earnings.

He suggested that the inevitable prison sentence could be suspended because his client, a woman of good character, suffered from depression. There had also been huge delays in the case being dealt with, he added.

But Mr Recorder Timothy Petts told Mann that it had to be immediate custody.

He said that it was a small, family-run, friendly firm where everyone was trusted in the handling of cash.

'Over a period of time you systematically abused that trust and treated cash receipts as your own,' he said.

It was a breach of 'a high degree of trust' where she was the manager, it went on over a three and a half year period, when she 'systematically and deliberately' stole from her employer. It was only brought to an end when she was caught.

She had tried to cover her tracks and disguise what was happening and blamed others by making 'wild allegations' which were entirely false.

The offences had caused considerable damage to the business and its reputation and her thieving continued when others were being made redundant and when the owner was undergoing cancer treatment, he said.

'This was a considerable period of thieving. Only immediate custody is appropriate,' he said.
