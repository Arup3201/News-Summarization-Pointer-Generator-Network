This is the moment a hapless thief is arrested by bouncers after he tried to steal from a car parked outside their training session.

Nathan Webb, 39, slipped inside the unlocked Vauxhall Astra parked outside The Training Hub in Manchester city centre in an attempt to grab a sat-nav.

But owner Danny Rose, a trainee doorman who was taking part in a session on how to use handcuffs, was watching from inside the building and rushed outside to stop him.

One of the trainee bouncer's is then seen approaching the car, where Webb is inside trying to take a sat-nav

He called for help from the centre manager - Marcus Gentles, a bouncer with 16 years’ experience – who was able to apprehend him with the handcuffs he had been using during the lesson.

CCTV footage shows Mr Gentles leaning into the driver’s seat, where Webb was sitting, and detain him as the trainees look on.

He held Webb inside the classroom for 15 minutes until the police arrived.

He was charged the next day and appeared before magistrates in Manchester where he pleaded guilty to theft from a motor vehicle.

Mr Gentles, a former Fusilier from Oldham, said candidates on the 10 candidates on the training course thought the incident had been staged as part of the session.

‘It was just so funny. He’s come up to a building that is teaching doormen how to arrest people - and has tried to steal from them,’ he said.

He opens the door as other trainee bouncers, who were learning how to use handcuffs, come rushing out 

‘I said to him, “Are you stupid mate? There are big signs outside”.

‘He said, “You’ve got to take a chance, mate”.’

His training centre works with Get Licensed to offer Security Industry Authority (SIA) approved sessions for would-be doormen and he has been doing the training for five years.

Webb is taken into classroom where he waits for police to arrive. He was charged the next day and pleaded guilty to theft from a motor vehicle

The 40-year-old said he taught candidates to make citizen’s arrests using handcuffs because police were increasingly over-stretched and often took up to 20 minutes to attend an incident.

He added: ‘People slag off the police but when you work in the industry you see how under-funded and over-stretched they are. That’s why we are now doing the arrests ourselves.’

Webb is due to be sentenced later this month.
