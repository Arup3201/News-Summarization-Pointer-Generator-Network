Rihanna has successfully won her bid for Topshop to pay her legal costs of £1.5million after the fashion chain used her image on a T-shirt (pictured)

Topshop has been ordered to pay Rihanna's 'startling' £1.5million legal bill in a further blow to the fashion chain after she won a ban on using her picture on its T-shirts.

The 26-year-old singer sued Topshop's parent company Arcadia for £3.3million after the sleeveless 'tank-top', which featured a photo taken during a video shoot, appeared in stores in 2011.

She was awarded the payout following a two-year legal battle last month and today at the Appeal Court successfully defeated a bid to pay her own estimated £919,000 legal costs from the trial.

Lawyers for Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group argued that there was 'no proper basis' for forcing them to pay up the bill along with their own costs.

Last month they lost their appeal and were faced with an increased legal bill from the pop star, estimated at £1.5million - as well as their own estimated £500,000 bill. 

But, today, appeal judges Lord Justice Richards, Lord Justice Kitchin and Lord Justice Underhill ruled the costs order was 'reasonable' and dismissed the challenge.

The legal battle was over a T-shirt featuring a photo taken during a video shoot for Rihanna's hit We Found Love in 2011.

Her legal team successfully argued her fans, who saw her as a fashion icon, would have falsely thought she had endorsed the garment sold by the high-street fashion store.

In July 2013, High Court judge Mr. Justice Birss found the store guilty of unlawfully passing off her image, and ordered them to pay her legal costs, even though he found the size of her bill 'startling' and 'somewhat surprising.'

But Arcadia, whose own legal costs for the trial amounted to just £350,000, had asked the three appeal judges at a hearing last year to overturn the orders.

Their counsel, Geoffrey Hobbs QC,said the judge had erred in law. But Lord Justice Kitchin said today that after careful consideration 'we are unable to accept that the judge fell into error.'

Lawyers for Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, which owns Topshop, argued that there was 'no proper basis' for forcing them to pay up the bill along with their own costs but appeal judges dismissed the challenge

He added: 'It follows that the appeal on costs must be dismissed.'

Rihanna, who was described as a 'style icon' by the trial judge, had claimed an estimated £3.5million in damages for the wrongful use of her photograph, described as 'unflattering'.

However an inquiry as to damages and profits made by Topshop have yet to be heard.

She also sought the return of any unsold T-shirts, but the court heard all 12,000 which started at £22 but reduced to £5 each, had been sold, and only five were left and kept for the legal action.

They were hung on clothes rails in court as Mr. Hobbs told the judges the T-shirts were like a canvas carrying words and images.

Lord Justice Kitchin said last month that Rihanna had an enormous reputation and goodwill and people might have bought the T-shirt thinking she had an association with it.

He said if Roger Federer's picture was on a tennis racket or Rory McIlroy's photo on a golf club people would think they endorsed it.

In his judgment, unanimously backed by the other two judges he dismissed Topshop's appeal.

He said there could be a 'false belief' by customers that the 'world famous pop star' had endorsed the T-shirt's bearing her image.

The court found that 'a substantial number of purchasers are likely to be deceived into buying the T-shirt because of false belief that it has been authorised by Rihanna herself.'

Because of her current tie up with high street rivals River Island it was found that the Topshop T-shirt would be damaging to the style icon's goodwill and a loss to her merchandising business.

'It also represents a loss of control over her reputation in the fashion sphere,' ruled Mr. Justice Birss.

The Barbadian star, who lives in America sued the Arcadia Group in her full name of Robyn Rihanna Fenty and did no appear in court.

The judge said the multi-millionaire has sold over 30 million albums and 120 million singles, and won over 200 awards including five prestigious Grammy awards.

The Appeal Judges agreed that it was 'right and fair' to grant her a permanent injunction after being told that Topshop had failed to promise not to use her image on T-shirts in the future.
