This artistic bird hoped to attract the attention of passing females by decorating his home with colourful fruit and discarded rubbish.

The Brown Gardener spent up to ten months building the intricate tent-like home - known as 'bower' - using twigs.

He then scoured the surrounding woodland for fruit, clothing, junk, and leaves and arranged them in neat piles outside.

Colourful: The Brown Gardener spent up to ten months building the intricate tent-like home and filling it with colourful objects

Some of the items - in bright shades of blue, yellow, pink, orange, and purple - are likely to have been stolen from rivals.

Photographer Konrad Wothe, 61, watched as the bird puffed out his chest and broke into bird song as part of an ellaborate mating ritual.

Females look for the most attractive arrangement and partner before nesting nearby and returning to the bower to mate.

Konrad, from Penzberg, Germany, snapped the scene in the rainforest of the Arfak Mountains, in West Papua, Indonesia.

Hard work: The birds spend months decorating the 'bowers' in Indonesia

He said: 'The bowers are not nests - they only serve to attract females.

'The colourful berries, flowers, and rubbish in the birds' gardens are also placed there to please a female.

'One male copulates with as many females as he can get, and the females build their nest and raise their chicks alone.'

He added: 'It was a three day hike to get there and I then photographed the birds from a hide for more than one week.'
