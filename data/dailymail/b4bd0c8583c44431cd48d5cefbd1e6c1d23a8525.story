One of the most deprived towns in the country today started to hand out free school breakfasts.

A total of 12,000 primary school pupils in Blackpool, Lancashire, will get the free start to the day amid fears they are arriving at classes starving.

The pilot scheme will last three months and will cost taxpayers £700,000, with deprived local authority Blackpool Council backing it.

Most important meal: Pupils at Devonshire Primary School can now enjoy a breakfast of fruit, toast, yoghurt and juice for free

The breakfasts include fruit, cereals and yoghurt and pupils must arrive 30 minutes before their first class to be fed.

Children at Devonshire Primary School were among some of the first to make the most of the breakfast scheme.

Shannon Wright, 9, from Layton, said: 'I thought it was a really tasty breakfast. It’s a nice to eat breakfast with my friends.

'We don’t always have time for breakfast at home so it will be good for my family.'

However, a spokesman for local 
government union UNISON said: 'We feel the money could be better spent 
saving jobs at this council.'

Free: The scheme is open to all pupils to remove the stigma that having free school meals sometimes bestows on children

But council leader Simon Blackburn says being properly fed will allow students to focus on their studies.

He said: 'The launch of this scheme is the culmination of a great deal of hard work to ensure that the children of Blackpool get the best possible start to their day and are able to maximise their ability to succeed in school.

'There will be no discrimination between those families that can afford it and those that cannot, every pupil will be able to start their school day fed and ready to learn.

'It is really important that as many parents as possible take up this new service - it was save them cash every week that they can spend elsewhere in the local economy, and makes a huge collective effort to get our kids in school bright and early, and ready to learn.'

He hopes the pilot scheme will eventually include secondary schools and universal free lunches.

The council says the idea is supported by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) and welcomed by the Children’s Society, whose research suggests the scheme is much needed.

A Children's Society survey of teachers about hunger at school found that nearly half of those surveyed found that children are often hungry during the school day and two thirds of the teachers surveyed stated that staff provide pupils with food or money if they have not eaten.

Help: Headteacher Neil Hodgkins, shown dining with pupils, said staff had reported some children were 'lethargic' through hunger

One teacher who took part said: 'Last 
month [I] found two girls sat on [the] toilet floor sharing one’s packed
lunch because other [girl] had no lunch money.'

Headteacher at Devonshire Primary School, Neil Hodgkins, applauded the scheme, saying: 'We see children in the morning who are lethargic and struggle to concentrate because they haven’t eaten properly.

'This scheme will help a lot to address those problems.'
