Killed: Kristen Fonseca, pictured, was struck in the back of the head and killed while jet skiing in Hawaii

A 16-year-old California girl has been killed in a horrific jet ski crash as her mother and step-father looked on.

Kristen Fonseca, of Valcaville, was struck in the back of the head by Australian tourist Tyson Dagley who was driving recklessly and died in hospital the next day.

Authorities said Dagley, 20, was standing up on his jet ski and posing for videos and photographs for his girlfriend before ramming the pretty teen on August 5.

They also said he was going 40 miles per hour - four times the speed Kristen was traveling at.

Dagley is being charged with third degree negligent homicide, a misdemeanor.

If convicted he faces a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a $1,000 fine, but Kristen's parents believe the punishment should be tougher.

'As far as I'm concerned that is not 
enough, that individual was operating the Jet Ski in a totally unsafe 
negligent manner,' her step-father, Mario Cantone, told Fox 40.

The family is now suing Dagley, claiming they 'have suffered horrible emotional pain, suffering and distress' after witnessing the horrific crash, which took place at Keehi Boat Harbour on the southern coast of Oahu, about five miles from Waikiki Beach.

They are seeking an unspecified amount of damages, including medical and funeral expenses.

According to investigators, Dagley was standing on his rented watercraft before it hit the teenager's jet ski from behind. He was allegedly looking at his girlfriend, who was taking photos and filming him, and not paying attention to where he was going.

Dagley's girlfriend Natasha Ryan, 21, is
charged with hindering his prosecution after she told investigators he 
was sitting down and looking straight ahead before the collision, and 
that she didn't see the crash.

However, a forensic computer examiner
recovered two deleted videos from the memory stick in Ryan's camera 
which showed the crash.

Court documents said that in the video, Dagley appears to be standing on the watercraft and that someone is heard yelling 'watch out.'

Ryan was released on $500 bail and is shown in her mug shot to be extremely distressed.

The young man, who suffered spinal injuries and a concussion in the crash, said he deeply regretted the accident and prayed Kristen would be OK before hearing of her death.

'Ever
since I was in the hospital I prayed everyday, just to the family, and 
prayed that everything was going to be okay with the girl,' Dagley, who 
has now been in custody a week, said in court.

Court documents say Dagley was heard at the scene saying, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't believe what I did. I'm so sorry.'

The 20-year-old carpet cleaner's family have traveled from Crestmead, Queensland, to Hawaii to support him.

Dagley's distraught father, Alan Dagley, told Australian newspaper The Courier-Mail from a Hawaiian hotel room that he feared his son would not return home with him.

'The maximum penalty is a year in jail, so we're trying to prepare ourselves for the worst and go from there,' he said.

'We know they (the victim's family) are hurting and we couldn't imagine being on their side. Tyson was saying to us that he wished it was him.'

Mr Dagley said the young couple had been saving for nearly two years for the holiday.

'Tyson and Natasha had been saving very well to do this (the holiday) all by themselves,' he said.

'He's very scared, he's still not 
that well with the injuries he got through his neck, head and shoulders.
He's a good kid, he hasn't got a bad bone in his body, he wouldn't hurt
anyone and that's the honest truth, he's so kind-hearted and accidents 
happen.'

His lawyer, Walter Rodby, told KHON 2 Dagley was 'depressed' about what happened.

'I mean let's face it. He came here 
for a vacation, now he's locked up, in can you imagine in OCCC with some
of Honolulu's finest,' he said.

In
a lawsuit filed on Monday in Honolulu's circuit court, the Fonseca 
family also names Aloha Jet Ski, the company that rented the watercrafts
to the pair, as a defendant.

The suit claims employees did nothing to prevent Dagley from driving recklessly.

An employee who rented the jet ski to 
Fonseca's family and Dagley 'failed to give any instructions or warnings
about driving at excessive speeds' before handing the man control, the 
papers state.

A Honolulu 
judge denied Dagley's request to reduce his $100,000 bail at his 
arraignment on Tuesday, considering him a flight risk.

The young man requested a jury trial on the misdemeanor charge. His next court date is August 23.

At a vigil back in California on Sunday, friends and family of the aspiring nurse shared memories, lit candles and let balloons into the sky.

Kristen was due to begin a work placement as a nurse at Kaiser Permanente in Vacaville on Wednesday, said her step-father, who, along with the rest of her family has returned home.

'She was excited about that. She just hated to see people in pain or hurt,' he said.

Her classmates were struggling to come to terms with the loss of the bubbly teen.

'Just to know she’s not coming back, it’s still unreal for all of us,' Lyna Jackson, a friend of Kristen's, told Fox.

Another friend, Halie Cunningham, said: 'It's really hard to deal with right now but we'll get through it. We all came out here to support her and her family and her mom.'
