The man who was Tory Treasurer when the party accepted almost £500,000 from corrupt Polly Peck tycoon Asil Nadir, said last night that David Cameron was under a ‘moral duty’ to give the money back.

As Nadir began a ten-year jail term for looting almost £29million from the collapsed company, Lord McAlpine, a scion of the construction dynasty, said the cash should be paid to Nadir’s creditors, some of whom lost their life savings.

‘It is tainted money and it shames the Conservatives if they hang on to it. They have a moral duty to give it back,’ he said.

The money was paid to the Tory Party between 1985 and 1990 when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party.

Senior figures from Lady Thatcher’s administration last night insisted that she would repay the money if she was still leader of the party.

Nadir, 71, was one of Britain’s most prominent businessmen in the 1980s, only to become one of the most notorious fugitives from justice when he fled Britain for northern Cyprus in 1993 while awaiting trial.

His conviction at the Old Bailey on Wednesday prompted immediate calls for the Tories to return the estimated £440,000 they received from Nadir’s collapsed Polly Peck company.

Touche Ross, the Polly Peck administrator, has written a letter to Tory HQ claiming at least £365,000 can be identified as money stolen from the company by Nadir.

The Tories last night indicated that they would hold on to the cash – worth £860,000 in today’s figures – even though the then party chairman Norman Fowler told the Commons in 1993: ‘Obviously if it is proved that the money was stolen it will be returned.’

The intervention of Lord McAlpine, speaking to the Daily Mail from his home in Venice, will ratchet up the pressure on the party to surrender the cash. He said: ‘When Asil Nadir gave the first donation to me, his Polly Peck company had just won a Queen’s Award for Industry.

‘He was a dashing figure who was admired across Europe for his business flair. No one thought for a second that he was bleeding his company dry through illicit means.

But frankly the moment he fled the country in 1993, to avoid criminal charges, it was obvious to me he was a complete conman. Frankly, the Tories should have given the money back in 1993.

‘But today the case is even clearer. There is a moral imperative for the money to be returned. The money was not Asil Nadir’s to give although we thought it was at the time.

‘Therefore the Tory Party has a duty to return it. It will speak volumes about the character of the modern Tory Party if they don’t do the right thing. I trust that David Cameron is an honourable man.’

Lord McAlpine, who was Tory Treasurer from 1975 when Lady Thatcher became leader until her fall in 1990, said: ‘I can tell you this: If Margaret Thatcher was still leader of the party I am absolutely certain she would have ordered the party to repay the lot. I can hear her barking down the phone: “Alistair, we can’t keep that man’s money”.’

The same view was echoed by Lord Powell, who was Lady Thatcher’s private secretary at Downing Street, at the time of the dealings with Nadir.

Lord Powell said: ‘My gut instinct tells me that Mrs Thatcher would have wanted that money repaid.’

However, former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said too much time had passed and that it would not be possible to show that the donated money had been stolen from Polly Peck.

Sir Malcolm, who was in the Cabinet under Lady Thatcher  and is still an MP, said: ‘It is very difficult to pick and choose when you are talking about money that was so many years ago. Asil Nadir was a rich man and had a great deal of personal wealth.

‘One would need to know a lot more about where the money came from before one could think about whether it should be handed back.’

From other Tory grandees there was a conspicuous silence. Former Cabinet members such as Lord (Cecil) Parkinson and Lady (Gillian) Shephard declined to comment.

When Nadir fled to Cyprus, the then prime minister Sir John Major said: ‘If it proves to have been dishonestly obtained and dishonestly remitted to us, then of course we will return it.’ Sir John was overseas and not available for comment.

Meanwhile, a Labour MP has written to Conservative co-chairman Baroness Warsi to demand the party hands the Asil Nadir cash back.

Simon Danczuk, MP for Rochdale, wrote: ‘The conviction of Asil Nadir raises the matter of his donations to the Conservative Party.

‘Sadly... the initial response of the Conservative Party, very soon after the conviction of Asil Nadir, was to say that the money would not be repaid.’
