Woody Allen, who faced sexual abuse allegations from his adopted daughter last month, is back on the big screen playing a pimp.

The actor-director stars in new movie Fading Gigolo as the owner of a failing New York bookshop who bizarrely finds himself organizing a threesome between his dermatologist, her friend and his employee Fioravante (played by the movie's writer-director John Turturro) for the price of $1,000.

The film, which also stars Sharon Stone, Sofia Vergara, Vanessa Paradis and Liev Schreiber, is due to be released on April 18 at limited theaters in the U.S.

The role is surprising as it is rare for Allen to star in a movie that he has not written and directed.

The sexually-charged film is likely to leave many movie-goers feeling uncomfortable following recently renewed allegations against Allen, 78, by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow that he molested her when she was seven years old.

Last month, Miss Farrow insisted she will not be 'silenced' by Allen and renewed her allegations in a New York Times blog.

Woody Allen's adopted daughter Dylan Farrow has accused him of sexual abuse

She wrote: 'I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set.

'Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.'

Woody went on to defend himself against the allegations, publicly denying being a child abuser and accusing his ex-partner Mia Farrow of being spiteful and malevolent via a letter published in the New York Times, which he said would be his 'final word' on the matter.

In the letter he raised the findings 
of a panel of experts used during the investigation into the claims, who
 found no evidence of abuse.

He
 said: 'Of course, I did not molest Dylan. I loved her and hope one day 
she will grasp how she has been cheated out of having a lov­ing father 
and exploited by a moth­er more interested in her own fester­ing anger 
than her daughter’s well-being.'

Allen was never charged with child sex abuse. He insists that his former partner Mia Farrow 'implanted' false memories into Dylan's consciousness to pay him back for falling in love and marrying Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn.

Mia and Woody were still together when he fell for Miss Previn, when he was 56 years old and she was around the age of 19.

Allen's new film goes touches on familiar themes of his multitudinous projects including repressed sexuality, sexual perversions and late-in-life disappointments.

There are jokes about his character's attempt at a threesome in the Seventies, failed sexual encounters and Vergara being a 'miracle of physics'. 

In one scene, Allen's character wanders a lingerie store admiring panties and suspenders while in another he openly ogles women in the park to bring home for his 'ho' Fioravante to have sex with.

Fading Gigolo, with its cast of A-listers, is due for limited release in the U.S. on April 18

Woody initially faced sexual abuse allegations over Dylan Farrow in 1992 during a custody battle with his former partner Mia Farrow, but they were later dropped without charge.

Allen received his 24th Oscar nomination at this year's Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay for his 2013 film Blue Jasmine.

The movie's lead actor Cate Blanchett received the Best Actress award for her role as narcissistic down-on-her-luck socialite Jasmine.
