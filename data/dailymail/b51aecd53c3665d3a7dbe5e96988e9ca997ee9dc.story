An Atlantic City casino has sparked a racism row after serving a special menu of fried chicken, collard greens and macaroni and cheese on Martin Luther King Jr's birthday.

The Borgata, which also features a luxury hotel and spa, was branded stereotypical and 'seriously racist' by hundreds of social media users after it unveiled the $24 menu last Thursday.

However, many others claimed that political correctness had run amok, saying that the food options were a 'tasty tribute' to the celebrated African-American pastor and civil rights activist.

Sparking debate: On Monday, professional poker player Shaun Deeb posted a photo of the controversial birthday menu on Twitter, alongside the caption (pictured): 'This is what borgata is serving. #isitracist?'

Speaking to AP, Joe Lupo, senior vice president of the Borgata, said The Metropolitan restaurant chose dishes that were among King's favorite foods, as documented in numerous historical sources.

'Our general manager of the restaurant is an African-American female who wanted to come up with the menu to celebrate and honor Dr. King,' said Mr Lupo.

'We allow our managers to run their restaurants. She did research and came up with an authentic recipe. It's very clear these were his favorite foods.'

A 2008 article in the Knoxville News Sentinel quotes a contemporary clergyman, Rev. G.H. Williams, a guide at the Martin Luther King Jr National Historic Site in Atlanta. 

Reply: In response to Mr Deeb's tweet, a Twitter user named Damola said: 'Yes but it also sounds delicious'

In agreement: Meanwhile, Karol Markowicz tweeted: 'Ummmm, yes'

Under control: The Borgota's press team replied to users with the tweet (pictured): 'We intended to honor the weekend by offering some of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's favorite foods as reported by many sources'

Leading a tour of King's childhood home, Mr Williams said: 'A favorite meal was the Sunday feast of fried chicken, collard greens, black-eyed peas and corn bread.'

Advertised as the Martin Luther King Jr. Special, the $24 menu consisted of fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, sweet potato casserole, collard greens and homemade pecan pie.

On Monday, professional poker player Shaun Deeb posted a photo of the New Jersey-based restaurant's menu on Twitter, alongside the caption: 'This is what borgata is serving. #isitracist?'

The Borgota's press team replied to users with the tweet: 'We intended to honor the weekend by offering some of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's favorite foods as reported by many sources.'

Mr Lupo later said the casino's restaurants offer menus geared toward other holidays, including Chinese meals at Chinese New Year, and Mexican food on Cinco de Mayo.

The Atlantic City NAACP did not immediately respond to a request by AP for comment.
