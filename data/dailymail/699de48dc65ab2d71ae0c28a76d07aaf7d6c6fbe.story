The police today unveiled its latest weapon to tackle dangerous driving – a Formula 1-inspired speed machine capable of more than 200mph. 

But the Caparo T1 won't be chasing down speeding motorists with officers instead using the vehicle to help them get their road safety messages through to motorists. 

Decked out like a police car, the Caparo T1, which was paraded at the 2013 Le Mans race, can do zero to 60mph in just 2.5 seconds.

Caparo loaned police the sports car to display at their stand at the Autosport International at the NEC in Birmingham. 

Superintendent Paul Keasey, head of Central Motorway Police Group, said the motor show was a perfect opportunity for police to 'engage with motorists who are interested in performance cars'.

Mr Keasey said: 'These are exactly the kinds of people who, in ordinary circumstances, we might never get to meet or chat to and so this event allows us to perhaps share our road safety vision in a setting where many car enthusiasts are receptive to what we've got to say.'

He said it was important that motorists make the distinction between motorsport and 'posing a risk to others by driving at speed on the highway'.

Police were also letting motorists try their 'ever-popular beer goggles', which help illustrate the dangers of driving while under the influence of alcohol.

Sergeant Rob Barker, who is one of the officers attending the exhibition, said taking a high-spec vehicle to the show really helped police breakdown barriers with motorists. 

He said: 'People literally flock around them and it gives us a great opportunity to meet and engage with car enthusiasts and hopefully get them to understand where we are coming from when we enforce road safety laws.

'Excess speed, using mobile phones, drink driving and not using seatbelts are a few of the topics we discussed.'
