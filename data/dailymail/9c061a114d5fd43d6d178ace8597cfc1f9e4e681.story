Manchester United midfield prospect Ben Pearson is in talks to join Barnsley on loan.

The youngster joined United in 2004 and has worked his way through the ranks.

Pearson had hoped to break into Louis van Gaal's senior squad from the Under-21 side this season following the example set by James Wilson.

In September, Pearson said: 'The manager has played a few youngsters already. Tyler (Blackett) has been playing regularly and Reece James has played.

'A few of the lads were involved against MK Dons and, hopefully, all of us can come through. The manager has done it previously at Ajax and Barcelona and I hope he can do it here.'

Pearson was named United's Young Player of the Year in 2013 and could be set to get first team opportunities at Barnsley.
