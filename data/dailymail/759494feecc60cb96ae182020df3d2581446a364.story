President Obama has enlisted the help of Hollywood A-listers, TV stars and professional athletes to join an ambitious new campaign to fight sexual assault on campus.

Amid a renewed focus on violence against women, Obama kicked off the ‘It’s On Us’ initiative Friday particularly aimed at encouraging men to take a stand.

Mad Men star Jon Hamm; Kerry Washington of Scandal fame, Nashville’s Connie Britton and NBA player Kevin Love are some of the familiar faces appearing in a public service announcement along with the president.

The campaign encourages everyone to consider making it their personal responsibility to stop sexual assault and to intervene when they suspect a woman can't or won't consent.

The constellation of stars featured in the sleek PSA also includes actresses Rose Byrne and Mayim Bialik; comedian Joel McHale; musicians Randy Jackson and Questlove; TV and radio personality Ryan Seacrest, and hip hop artist Common.

As part of the 30-second video, the celebrities look into the camera and recite the words: ‘it’s on us stop sexual assault, to get in the way before it happens, to get a friend home, say did not blame the victim; it’s on us to look out for each other, to not look the other way; it's on us to stand up, to step in, to take responsibility; it's on us, all of us, to stop sexual assault.’

At the end of the clip, President Obama appears on the screen and says: ‘learn how and take the pledge at itsOnUs.org.’

The campaign officially kicked off Friday afternoon at an event in the White House, which featured an appearance by sexual assault survivor Lilly Jay who introduced Vice President Joe Biden and shared her personal experience of being raped at Amherst University as a student.

‘Recalling rape always hurts,’ she said, adding that having ‘allies’ on your side can make a world of difference. ‘They help carry the heavy truth that colleges can, and should, be safer.’

With an estimated 1 in 5 college women experiencing an attack, Obama decried ‘the quiet tolerance of sexual assault’ and called it ‘an affront to our basic humanity.’

Research has shown most victims know their attackers, alcohol or drugs are often involved and only 12 per cent of college women report the attack to police.

The Obama administration has been raising awareness of the problem this year, ahead of a midterm election in which Democrats are counting on a strong turnout by female voters.

In January, Obama launched the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault that recommended action campuses could take to protect victims.

The U.S. Department of Education for the first time publicly exposed the list of colleges under federal investigation for their handling of sexual assault complaints.

The latest effort has a particular focus on reaching men on campus.

‘You don't want to be the guy who stops a friend from taking a woman home,’ Obama said, while arguing it is men's responsibility to do so.

Biden was even more blunt in his message to men. ‘Step up!’ he said. "Be responsible. Intervene. You have an obligation to make a pariah of those on campus who abuse another person.’

Violence against women has taken on a new prominence recently amid controversy over the NFL's handling of domestic assault involving its players.

Obama said society, including sports leagues, too often sends the message that women aren't valued. And with recent sexual assault scandals of their own, the nation's military academies are among the collegiate partners in the campaign, Obama said.

The campaign is supported by partners who plan to help spread the message, including nearly 200 colleges and universities, the NCAA, several collegiate athletic conferences and media companies with reach among students.

The NCAA plans to promote anti-assault messages on screens at their championship events. Video-game maker Electronic Arts will encourage fans to pledge to support the campaign through its online platforms.

And media giant Viacom will promote the messages on websites, including for music channels MTV, VH1, BET and CMT. 

Visitors to the Itsonus.org website are asked to turn their social media profile pictures into the campaign logo badge.

They are asked to use their name, email address and zip code to pledge ‘not to be a bystander to the problem but to be a part of the solution.’

The information is collected by Generation Progress, the youth arm of the liberal Center for American Progress advocacy organization with close ties to the White House.

The Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women will also award over $6million to 18 colleges with grants to develop comprehensive campus sexual assault prevention and response programs.
