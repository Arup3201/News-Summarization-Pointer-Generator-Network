In different circumstances, Steven Naismith’s national anthem of choice might have been the Land of My Fathers, rather than Flower of Scotland.

The talented Everton forward has emerged as a key tenet of Scotland manager Gordon Strachan’s squad. Yet, with his father having been born in Wales, he had options when it came to his allegiance as a youngster.

All very topical given the issue which has dominated the build-up to Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier between Scotland and Republic of Ireland.

Scotland's Steven Naismith says he could have played for Wales as his father was born there

Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy are Scots playing for Ireland. James Morrison, Russell Martin and Chris Martin are Englishmen playing for Scotland.

Born and reared in Ayrshire, however, there was never any genuine prospect of Naismith accepting the invitation to become the Scotsman who played for Wales.

‘I was playing for Scotland Under-19s and my father was born in Wales, so I could have played for them — but it wasn’t something that crossed my mind,’ revealed the 28-year-old.

‘I was enjoying playing for the Under-19s and growing up it never crossed my mind that I could play for Wales. It was probably brought to my attention by them chancing their arm and thinking it might be an opportunity.

‘I always thought about playing at Hampden. But don’t get me wrong – everybody’s circumstances are different.

‘If there’s a chance for somebody to have an international career and maybe go to a major tournament, would you give that up just because you weren’t born in that country?

‘Everybody’s different and so are their circumstances. I was fortunate that I had played for Scotland since I was 17 and everybody knew about that.

‘And I knew if I did well for my club and the international team, I would progress.’

It helped that there was no pressure from his father to have a change of heart.

‘My Dad sees himself as Scottish,’ Naismith explained. ‘He was born in Wales but he was only there for a few weeks so there wasn’t anything to debate.’

For others, the decision was less cut and dried.

The furore over McGeady and McCarthy has provided the main backdrop to a game dominated by intricate sub-plots and side shows.

Both players were entitled to play for Ireland by virtue of a grandparent. McCarthy, it should be said, was also ignored by the SFA for some time — a fact which can hardly be overlooked by prospective boo boys.

Most of the English-born players in the Scotland squad are also eligible under the grandparent rule. Were the decision his, Naismith would draw the line at parents.

‘Those are the rules so if it can improve your team, and it has improved our team, we’re happy about it,’ he continued.

‘I personally think there should be a cut- off — not distant relatives. But those are the rules at the moment and every country in the world is doing it so I don’t think there’s any point in debating it. We wouldn’t have too many complaints about it.’

Asked if having a Scottish or Irish grandparent is simply too tenuous, the former Rangers player nodded. ‘I think it could get changed a bit to, maybe use the word, tighten it up a bit,’ he said. ‘That’s my view personally. Then again, who am I?’

The subject is never likely to arise in an Everton dressing room where some of his closest colleagues play for the Republic.

Seamus Coleman will be detailed to mark Scotland dangerman Ikechi Anya and, in a sobering assessment for those who think home advantage will be enough to beat the Irish, Naismith says of his club-mate: ‘For me, he’s the best right-back in Europe.

‘He’s probably the most down-to-earth guy I’ve ever met in football and it’s great to see how he’s just going to be a superstar.

‘Nothing fazes him. He just goes about his business. He does everything exactly the same as when he was back in Sligo. That’s a fantastic quality to have.

‘He gets everything he deserves because he is such a fantastic player. He is so humble and works very hard to get where he is.

‘Darron Gibson (in midfield) shouldn’t be underestimated, either. They’re definitely quality players and they are going to be a threat.’

The likelihood is that Martin O’Neill will line up with a 4-1-4-1 formation geared towards throttling the life out of Scotland’s 4-2-3-1. The former Celtic manager’s emphasis on set-pieces is also familiar enough to supporters in this country.

Yet Naismith sees no benefit in dwelling on what Ireland will do. Buoyed by the performances in the opening three qualifiers, the striker says Scotland now have the luxury of concentrating on their own abilities.

‘Scotland is in a fantastic position at the moment,’ he said. ‘What’s going on is really enjoyable for everyone in the squad and that’s showing in our performances.

‘The manager will highlight what Ireland’s positives and weaknesses are. But it’s mainly what we’re going to do and that’s the way it should be.

‘It’s the hardest group and we’ll need to be great all the way to get through, but we’re capable of it.’

Highlighted by Scotland legend Graeme Souness as a ‘proper lad’ who mixes quality with a ferocious work ethic, Naismith was flattered by the remarks.

Yet he knows, and accepts, there is one area of his game – identified by Souness as Scotland’s achillies heel - he needs to improve.

Four goals in 31 caps for his country is an improvement on Steven Fletcher’s one in 16. In comparison with Robbie Keane’s 65 goals for Ireland, however, it’s small beer.

‘On the goalscoring, all the forwards are at fault,’ Naismith acknowledged. ‘I don’t have a good scoring record for Scotland and think I should do better.

‘Fletch is probably the same and I’m sure Shaun Maloney has said he should score more.

‘In this day and age, it’s not about one guy scoring.

‘On the other hand, if we make it to the major tournament and Fletch hasn’t scored a single goal, I won’t care as long we’re there. I don’t think he’d care, either.’
