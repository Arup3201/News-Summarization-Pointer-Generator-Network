It is the most advanced paper plane ever created - and can even be controlled by an iPhone.

Created by U.S firm Power Up toys, the PowerUp3 is an add-on gadget for homemade paper planes that gives them a small motor and propeller.

When connected to the PowerUp app, the smartphone is used as a remote control to fly the plane wirelessly - and a single charge can last up to 10 minutes.

Any paper plane can be fitted with the PowerUp motor and a propeller connected to a carbon fibre shaft, pictured left. The plane can then be controlled via Bluetooth using an app on a smartphone, right, which shows the plane's altitude. Power Up's motor can run for 10 minutes on a single charge

The £30 kit, which goes on sale next month, has a Bluetooth receiver built-in so it can communicate wirelessly with the iOS app.

'Pilots' can control the height of the plane, and make it turn left or right, using their handset and the app even gives information such as the plane’s altitude.

However, there is one snag - users still need to provide they own paper plane, although the firm helpfully supplies instructions for making what it claims is the ultimate design.

The kit, which clips onto the plane, has a motor connected by a carbon fibre shaft to a propeller. 

‘Just build a plane out of a piece of standard paper, attach the motor, and open up the app on your phone - it'll fly for up to ten minutes on a single charge,’ the firm said.

It also encourages owners to experiment with their own designs for planes.

‘At PowerUp, we strongly encourage experimentation, and part of the fun is tweaking your airplane designs to achieve the best results.’

The firm added the gadget is made of a highly durable carbon fiber composite, so it will not break with normal use - however, it warns ‘that does not mean it is indestructible!’

The £30 kit doesn't come with paper planes included but PowerUp has created an instructional video, pictured, on how to build the most aerodynamic paper aircraft that will fit the motor and propeller
