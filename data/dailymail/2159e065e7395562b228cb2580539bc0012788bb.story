Watford player Alexander Merkel had to fight off a four-strong gang of robbers at his home

A top footballer was attacked by a gang of robbers on mopeds who battered their way into his home and stole a bag from him.

German international Alexander Merkel, 22, has been renting a house in Hampstead while on loan to Championship side Watford.

A four-strong gang - who are believed to be behind a spate of similar attacks - were all dressed in black as they tried to smash down his front door with their mopeds.

The Kazakhstan-born footballer opened the door at 10.30pm on May 2 and was immediately attacked by two of the men.

After a struggle in which they failed to force him to part with his wristwatch, they grabbed a bag of his and fled.

The two main attackers got away on mopeds which were driven by their two accomplices.

Mr Merkel, who has previously played for Milan and Genoa in Italy, has been renting the house while on loan to Watford from Italian club Udinese.

A neighbour, who heard the men trying to break their way in, called the police.

He said : 'I heard a commotion outside and went to have a look. Two mopeds with four people on the back were outside a neighbour's front door.

'One of the guys tried to kick it in but bounced off in a rather comical fashion. They then tried to ram it with their scooters.

'It looked like they knew which house they wanted to get into - it's quite concerning.'

Another 
resident, who heard shouting and the revving of engines said: 'It really was
 quite scary. We spoke to the victim afterwards and he looked quite 
shocked.'

The raid, at Mr Merkel's home not far from Hampstead High Street, follows similar moped raids in nearby Hampstead Garden Suburb

The gang is believed to have struck in another street nearby an hour earlier.

Merkel, who drives a Maserati, joined Watford on loan in January and played with them until the season ended. He scored his only goal of the season in a 3-0 win against Barnsley.

A friend said today that the player was currently on holiday. He added: 'Luckily they did not manage to take very much and he is fine.'

Detective Constable Andy Palmer, from Camden Police, said: 'I am sure this gang is known to certain members of the community so I would urge them to contact police before someone is seriously hurt.'

He said the two main suspects were aged between 18 and 25. One was 6ft tall, of slim build and with an Irish accent. The other was 6ft 2in and of medium build.
