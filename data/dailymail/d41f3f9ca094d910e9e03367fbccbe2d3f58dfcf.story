LeBron James has ended speculation over his future after announcing that he will re-sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers as a free agent after leaving Miami Heat last season.

King James is returning to Cleveland four years after an acrimonious split announced on national television that saw him bolt his hometown to take his talents to South Beach.

The announcement caps weeks of speculation over where the two-time NBA champion would go after his contract with Miami expired following this year's NBA Finals loss to the San Antonio Spurs.

James told the magazine that despite finally getting the elusive rings he craved while with the Cavaliers, he felt leaving Northeast Ohio was never permanent, and compared it to college.

'My relationship with Northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball. I didn’t realize that four years ago. I do now.'

He also expressed regret over 'The Decision,' an interview televised across the country on ESPN in which he announced which team he would sign with as a free agent by saying 'I'm going to take my talents to South Beach and join the Miami Heat.'

James admitted he would have done things much differently if he had them to do over again, but that he still would have left for Miami.

He explained in the essay that he left Cleveland 'seeking championships' and won them, but that Cleveland hasn't had one in a long time and his goal was to bring the title home.

'I always believed that I’d return to Cleveland and finish my career there,' he said.

He believed this despite Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert posting an angry letter on the team's website ranting that James betrayed the team and its fans.
