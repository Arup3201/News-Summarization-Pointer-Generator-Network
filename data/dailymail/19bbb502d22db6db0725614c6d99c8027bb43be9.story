A garbage man allegedly pretended to be his dead twin to scam $580,000 from welfare authorities over two decades.

Thomas Murphy's twin Robert died a day after they were born in 1992, but Thomas, of Queens in New York is accused of taking up his identity 20 years later.

Thomas - who earned close to $80,000 a year in his role as a sanitation worker - allegedly started the scam in 1994.

The 52-year-old was only caught by facial-recognition technology at the state Department of Motor Vehicles which discovered that Thomas' face was also on the license he got in Robert's name, authorities said.

For reasons that are unclear their father, also named Robert Murphy, asked for and received Social Security cards for both boys in 1973, according to court papers, reported the New York Post.

Posing as his dead twin, Thomas allegedly claimed he suffered from depression and then qualified for Social Security disability benefits in his brother's name.

He also received government housing subsidies and food stamps, again as Robert - using some of the allegedly illegally gained money to rent a separate apartment, where he introduced himself to neighbours as 'Robert Murphy,' said officials and local residents.

'I had no idea he was cheating the system. He went by 'Robert,' ' said his former landlord.

'Not once did he ever mention having a brother. He paid the rent on time, but you never saw the guy. 

Owen McShane, the DMV's director of investigations, said his office has uncovered thousands of illegal licenses with the facial recognition technology, but none involving a twin using his sibling's image for alleged welfare fraud.

'This is the first case,' he told the New York Post.

He said that after DMV investigators noticed the similarities in photos, they checked with Social Security and learned that Robert was dead.

Thomas was arrested on charges including grand larceny, fraud and identity theft.
