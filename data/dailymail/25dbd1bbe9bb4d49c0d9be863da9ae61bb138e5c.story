The future looks bright for a dark corner of England which has been named one of the world's best places to gaze at the night sky.

A 370,000-acre expanse of rural Northumberland has won coveted protected status, the largest to do so in Europe, in a backlash against the light pollution which thwarts stargazers in towns and cities.

Astronomers hope it will encourage a new wave of 'stargazing tourism' to the zone, which skirts Hadrian's Wall and will be named the Northumberland International Dark Sky Park.

The zone, which includes parts of the Northumberland National Park and Kielder Water & Forest Park, on the Scottish border, has already been the focus of a fervent campaign to preserve the night sky.

In 2008 a team of dedicated volunteers opened of the Kiedler Observatory, one of the most modern in Britain charged with getting ordinary people excited about stargazing.

Astronomer Royal for England Sir 
Martin Rees said: 'I'd like to offer warm support to this development. 
It is a further boost for Kielder Observatory and stargazing throughout 
Northumberland National Park.

'All humans, everywhere in the world and throughout history, have looked up at the sky and wondered at it. This
 experience is now denied to most people, because of the background 
light in towns and cities.'

The US-based International Dark Skies Association (IDA) granted the zone Gold Tier Dark Sky Park status, the highest possible.

Such parks, which include Death Valley in the U.S., have stringent rules to halt the spread of light pollution including the promotion of sophisticated outdoor lighting to residents.

The bid for protected status took two 
years and was spearheaded by Northumberland National Park Authority, 
Kielder Water & Forest Park Development Trust and Kielder 
Observatory Astronomical Society.

TV impressionist Jon Culshaw, an amateur astronomer, said: 'The site of Kielder observatory is a truly magnificent dark sky area.

'Having filmed an episode of The Sky at Night there, it was incredible witness light levels fall to such a depth that you would swear the stars were casting shadows.

'It's a sad thought that such genuinely dark sky sites are becoming increasingly rare.

'We must value them, preserve them and ensure they can be enjoyed by as many visitors as possible who may take in the majesty of a spectacularly non-light polluted night sky.'

Elisabeth Rowark, chairman of the Northumberland Dark Skies Working Group, said: 'We have worked so hard together to reach this tremendous day for everyone committed to securing protection for England's largest area of starry skies.

'We do not want to turn off the lights, but rather encourage better lighting using the latest technology. This is the start of a new chapter for Northumberland where quite literally the sky is the limit.'

Cllr John Riddle, chairman of Northumberland National Park Authority, added: 'Starry nights, tranquil villages, rolling hills and forests are all part of the Northumberland experience that visitors love. This move will reclaim the night and protect this rich legacy for future generations.'
