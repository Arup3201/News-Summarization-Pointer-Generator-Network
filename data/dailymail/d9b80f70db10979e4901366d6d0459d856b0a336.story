Janay McFarlane was shot once in the head last Friday night in North Chicago. McFarlane, the mother of a three-month-old boy, was in the Chicago suburb visiting friends and family.

Earlier that day, McFarlane's 14-year-old sister was just feet away from Obama at Chicago's Hyde Park Career Academy, where the president spoke about gun violence.

The president discussed the worrying 
number of shootings, which have taken place in the city, and the tragic 
death of another young girl, Hadiya Pendleton, 15, an honors student who
was murdered in a case of mistaken identity days after performing in 
his inauguration.

Destini
returned to her family's South Lowe Avenue home on Friday evening with 
the president's words still echoing her ears, Pendleton's parents had 
also been there to hear his speech.

Gun control: Students of the Hyde Park Career Academy attended a speech by the President on gun crime on Friday. Destini Warren was a member of the audience hours before her sister, 18, was shot dead

'What
happened to Hadiya is not unique, it's not unique to Chicago, it's not 
unique to this country. Too many of our children are being taken away 
from us.' the President said.

'Last
year there were 443 murders with a firearm on the streets of this city.
65 of those murders were 18 and under that's the equivalent of a 
Newtown every four months...These [gun control] proposals deserve a vote
in Congress.'

Earlier this week, Destini took to Facebook to 
speak of her family's griefÂ  as they became the latest Chicago home to 
be torn apart by gun violence.

'We
have Baby Jayden to remember Janay my sister's last words were "My Baby
... My Baby . I just wish I cam have her back or at least to say 
goodbye, she wrote. 'I need her. I finally figured out that I'm not 
dreaming she's actually gone. My whole world is upside down.'

The
two sisters excitedly discussed the President's visit in Destini's room
the night before, she was sitting on a bench a short distance from the 
President when he spoke.

Janay McFarlane was due to graduate in
June and had plans to become a chef. She was due to go prom dress 
shopping with her mother
