Winning $55,000 on the lottery would be enough for most people.

But within 24 hours, Cary Collings bought another scratchcard on the way to cashing in his ticket - and won another $200,000.

The 61-year-old can count himself among the luckiest men in America after winning the life changing sum.

Cary Collings, 61, says he will continue working despite winning the life changing sum in just one day

Collings bought his first card on Thursday as he filled up his car at the River Road Food Mart on River Road in Puyallup, Washington.

He scratched it off at the traffic lights and realised he had scooped $55,555 on the Red Hot 5's.

The following day he stopped to try his luck once more.

After celebrating with a pizza bought three Bring on Bens scratch tickets and won $200,000 with the first one.

Collings has played WA Lottery since it launched in 2004 but those two tickets were the first time he had ever won a significant amount.

Collings said he will carry on working at Auburn Boeing branch despite his winnings.

He is still not sure how he will spend the money but has earmarked some of it for repaying a debt.

He is not the only person to win the lottery twice.

George Traykov, a Bulgarian property developer who lives in Essex, beat odds of one-in-438million when he picked up a Â£160,873 EuroMillions prize this year to add
 to the Â£1million sum he won in the Millionaire Raffle in September 
2011.

Mr Traykov, who never picks his own 
numbers and always plays the lucky dip, was so laid back about his 
second big money win that he didn't even claim it until two months after
 the prize draw in November.

Last year, Joseph Sylvester, from Arlington, hit the jackpot twice in three months.

He won the $100,000 top prize in the Lottery's Cash 5 game on April 3, and then matched all five numbers again in the July 3 drawing.

The previous year, Delma Kinney won a $1million prize playing the 
instant game Super Millions to add to the $1million he won on a previous instant game.

In 2008, Mr Kinney won $1 million playing a previous instant game.
