The cheers back in Wales were drowned out by boos around Murrayfield as Warren Gatland’s side secured a controversial victory over Scotland to get their RBS 6 Nations back on track.

Following a passionately fought contest, referee Glen Jackson found himself in the firing line after he blew the final whistle with time seemingly still running on the clock.

Scotland skipper Greig Laidlaw was adamant that his team should have been given the chance to take one last kick-off and go for the win, following a try from Jon Welsh in the dying moments that narrowed the deficit to just three points.

‘From where I was sitting, there was time to take the kick,’ said Laidlaw. ‘Whether we would have gone on to score, that’s a different matter. The majority of the stadium seemed to feel the same.’

Ironically, Jackson used to play under Scotland coach Vern Cotter during his days as a fly-half for New Zealand side Bay of Plenty. But the Kiwi offered no favours to his former boss.

‘I’m sure others will look at the referee’s performance and decisions,’ said Cotter. ‘We will send something through that will help them (in their assessment).’

The dispute brought a sour end to a fierce contest, with the metronomic boot of Wales full back Leigh Halfpenny ultimately proving the difference after both sides scored two tries apiece. Following an anonymous performance against England in round one, emphasis in the Welsh camp had been on go-forward initiative.

It took less than a minute for Jamie Roberts to make his first charge into the No 10 channel, but there was an over-eagerness as Jonathan Davies was turned over and Richard Hibbard mis-fired at the line-out. Wales dominated initial territory and possession, capitalising with a Halfpenny penalty, yet the tables were quickly turned.

Alex Cuthbert was left isolated after a lateral run and he was turned over by fly-half Finn Russell. Richie Gray recycled, allowing Stuart Hogg to step on the gas and run under the posts from inside his own half.

His try was converted by Laidlaw, who followed up with a penalty. Wales had been criticised for unnecessary kicking against England but they used the boot more effectively in the Scottish capital. The high-ball skills of Halfpenny, Dan Biggar and Liam Williams provided a dangerous attacking weapon and the trio challenged well for up-and-unders in Scottish territory.

Rhys Webb was pulled down just short after a fine take by Halfpenny, who subsequently had the chance to narrow the deficit with a second penalty. Then Biggar was taken out in mid-air by his opposite number, Russell, and Wales took the sting out of Scotland’s momentum with a penalty while a yellow card came for the Scottish No 10.

Wales launched a pivotal pitch-length counter-attack. Cuthbert made the initial surge, Williams kept the move going and sent Webb clear for his second try of the competition. Jonathan Davies joined Russell in the sin-bin for a second mid-air collision, but Gatland felt the initial incident was far more serious. ‘My initial reaction was the first one was red and the second one I am not sure,’ said the Wales coach.

Urged on by the home crowd, Scotland looked to seize the half-time initiative but Wales killed off a 13-man driving maul and, after some dazzling footwork, Hogg was denied a certain score following a tackle by the equally brilliant Halfpenny.

With Russell returning to the fold shortly after the break, Laidlaw edged his side back with three points following an excellent turnover by Alex Dunbar on Roberts. The kickers exchanged further penalties, before Williams had a try ruled out just before the hour. Following a rare missed kick by Halfpenny, the Scottish defence was eventually breached. Gatland had kept faith in his Lions and, after his yellow card, Davies went some way to repaying that when he ran a fine line off Biggar. The centre evaded the attention of Matt Scott and stepped inside Hogg to pull his side clear.

Scotland, meanwhile, failed to turn their pressure into points. Laidlaw turned down a kick at goal, while Mark Bennett had a late score chalked off for a forward pass. Welsh crashed over for the last-minute score and Russell eventually kicked the conversion, but Scotland were left to rue lost time.
