Stunning murals estimated to be nearly 1,500-years-old have been discovered buried with a Chinese warlord and his wife.

The orate drawings were painted on the wall of a doomed tomb  in Shuozhou City, about 200 miles (330 kilometres) southwest of Beijing.

Their original colours are  largely preserved - the murals are in a remarkable condition given their age.

Discovered: A colourful, well-preserved mural tomb, where a military commander and his wife were likely buried nearly 1,500 years ago, has been uncovered in China

Condition: The domed tomb's murals was discovered in Shuozhou City, about 200 miles (330 kilometres) southwest of Beijing

Preservation: The original colours are largely preserved in the spacious tomb which opens out at the end of a passage

Researchers estimate that the murals 
cover an area of about 860 square feet (80 square meters), almost the 
same area as a modern-day bowling.

Although some of the pictures are damaged due to the age, many of the depictions are remarkably well preserved.

One of the images shows a battle scene as two men hold out black batons and spar.

Another one of them depicts a horse pulling a carriage along followed by a several other horses - again it looks like a battle scene.

In the tomb, items such as pottery figurines, pottery models and glazed ceramic vessels were also found when it was unearthed in 2008.

Impressive: Although parts of the mural are missing due to the wall cracking the tomb is generally in a good condition

Coverage: Researchers estimate that the murals cover an area of about 860 square feet (80 square metres), almost the same area as a modern-day bowling lane

Burial: Archaeologists believe the couple buried at the site consisted of a military commander, in charge of the Shuozhou City area, and his wife

Archaeologist Liu Yan, who reported the discovery, said that the tomb had been robbed three times before he got to it.

Most of the grave goods, including 
the bodies, were gone and thieves were making preparations to steal the 
murals too, but they were halted after the discovery.

'Tomb robbers had already made preparations for removing the murals. The blue lines that were drawn to divide the murals into sections for cutting and the gauze fabric used for reinforcing the murals before detachment still remain on the surface of the walls,' said Yan reported the Huffington Post.

The structure of the tomb, murals, and tomb furnishings suggest that the tomb was built in the late Northern Qi Dynasty.

Archaeologists
believe the couple buried at the site consisted of a military 
commander, in charge of the Shuozhou City area, and his wife.

Shuozhou is a city in the north of Shanxi Province in North China, located on the upper reaches of the Fen River.
