Wesley Sneijder was a late withdrawal from Holland's starting line-up for their third-place play-off match against Brazil, after picking up a hamstring injury during the warm-up.

The 30-year-old, who forced his way back into the Holland set-up after being dropped by Louis van Gaal last year, had appeared in all six of their games at the World Cup before the Brazil match.

The experienced playmaker has appeared at three World Cups for his national side and it has been 17 matches since Holland last played a World Cup match without him (in 2002).

Sign of things to come? Sneijder went down clutching his right leg during the semi-final defeat to Argentina

He went down holding his right leg 
during extra-time of Holland's semi-final defeat to Argentina on 
Wednesday, though he recovered from that to complete the game.

The attacker was one of the two Holland players to miss a penalty in the shoot-out against Alejandro Sabella's side.

Sneijder
 began limping minutes before kick-off against the host nation at 
Estadio Nacional in Brasilia, which prompted Van Gaal to replace him 
with Jonathan de Guzman in the starting eleven.

The injury will be closely monitored by Sneijder's club side Galatasaray, with the Turkish season set to start next month.
