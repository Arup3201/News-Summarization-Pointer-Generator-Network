A burglar was caught red-handed after he broke into a house that had been fitted with secret cameras, which had been rigged by police.

Andres Balog, 26, forced his way into the property in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, and stole jewellery and £10 in cash.

His entry triggered special motion-sensor cameras, which then filmed his every move inside the ‘capture house’.

Footage released by police shows Balog snooping around and rifling through bags in the living room and hallway.

He then appears to look directly at a hidden camera in the kitchen before he is seen rummaging through cupboards.

Balog, of no permanent address, was identified just over a week later when officers recognised him as he was brought into custody on suspicion of a separate offence.

He was jailed for four-and-a-half months after he admitted the burglary on January 12 when he appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court last Wednesday.

After the 
hearing, Detective Sergeant Nicki Addison, from West Midlands Police, 
said: ‘Houses, sheds, garages and outbuildings can all be fitted with 
this portable and easy to install equipment, meaning any property in a 
burglary hot spot area can be quickly converted to capture thieves.

‘By
 informing the public of the success of these capture houses and 
revealing just a snippet of our capabilities, the message from us is 
two-fold.

‘Firstly we are sending a clear warning to criminals that if they commit burglary in the city they will be caught.

‘Secondly, the people of Wolverhampton can be reassured that we’re working on innovative ways to protect them.’

DS Addison added: ‘The capture houses are only one thread of a continuing drive to reduce burglaries and increase the number of offenders brought to justice.

‘We also work to help people avoid becoming victims of burglary in the first place by regularly offering crime prevention advice and encouraging people to register their property through the online property recording website www.immobilise.com.’

West Midlands Police have a series of capture houses spread across the region in a bid to catch thieves red-handed.

And the force say the tactic has helped see burglary rates fall by 57 per cent in Wolverhampton during the last ten years.
