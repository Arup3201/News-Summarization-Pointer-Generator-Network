A little-known Canadian actress is to portray Casey Anthony in a movie chronicling the controversial murder trial that led to the shock acquittal of America's most hated mother, it was revealed today.

Holly Deveaux will play the 26-year-old, who has been vilified by the public after a Florida jury found her not guilty of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee.

And West Wing star Rob Lowe will play prosecuting lawyer Jeff Ashley, whose book Imperfect Justice is the basis for the movie titled Prosecuting Casey Anthony, which begins filming today.

Oscar Nunez, best known for his part as Oscar Martinez on the U.S. version of The Office, will portray her defence attorney Jose Baez.

It is the biggest project yet for Miss Deveaux, 19, who - despite sharing a resemblance to Anthony - has so far only starred in the Canadian TV series Baxter.

She beat Kristen Stewart, Alyssa Milano and Jennifer Love Hewitt to get the part for the movie, which - due to cost - is being shot in the Canadian city of Winnipeg rather than the trial location of Orlando.

However, the Toronto-born actress's role will actually be relatively limited because Lifetime producers plan to rely heavily on news footage to give the film a documentary look.

The film's writer Alison Cross told the Orlando Sentinel: 'It’s not our intention to make a movie that tries Casey Anthony for the third time.

'She was tried in court and she was tried by public opinion.'

However, it emerged yesterday that Anthony will appear in court again after being found in hiding in Florida by investigators who subpoenaed her for a defamation case.

She is being sued by Zenaida Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter 'Zanny the Nanny' who Anthony initially told police had kidnapped Caylee. Anthony admitted fabricating that story.

It later emerged that Anthony, whose acquittal last July has been compared to the infamous OJ Simpson case, did not know anyone by that name and the real Miss Gonzalez is not even a nanny.

Now Miss Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008.

After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool.

It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release from Orange County Jail.

Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter.

She was convicted of four counts of lying to police and is now on probation on an unrelated cheque fraud conviction.

The defamation trial is set to begin at the start of the New Year. But, as Anthony had not been seen in public, lawyers for Miss Gonzalez feared she might go missing and decided to track her down.

They staked out her home for several days without Anthony appearing to be served a subpoena. Eventually, the defendant's lawyers intervened and said she would attend the court hearing.

'Our investigation team had her whereabouts pinned down,' Miss Gonzalez's attorney Matt Morgan told People magazine.

'Their backs were against the wall, so her attorneys said that they would accept service on her behalf.'

Despite going into hiding, Anthony had not entirely shied away from publicity.

In October she appeared in a video diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes for herself', although failed to mention Caylee.

It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptised again in a bid to  symbolise a new beginning.

However, this apparent new devotion to faith has not stopped her revealing a string of racy photographs of herself.

Anthony has been in hiding in Florida since she was acquitted last July in one of the most controversial verdicts since the OJ Simpson case.

She was released from prison after a jury found her not guilty of killing her daughter Caylee in 2008, after the toddler's remains were found in woods near Anthony's family's home.
