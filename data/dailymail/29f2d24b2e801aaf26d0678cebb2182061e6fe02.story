A memorial to police chokehold victim Eric Garner was damaged by fire on the day which celebrates civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

Garner's daughter Erica posted on her Twitter account that the site, which had candles and flowers remembering the 43-year-old Staten Island father, had been burnt down on Monday night.

Police said  that 'candles under plexiglass' were the cause of the accidental fire, the New York Daily News reported.

The memorial to Eric Garner was burnt down Monday night after a vigil to the late Staten Island father.  Above, the site was full of candles and flowers in early December, after a grand jury refused to indict the police officer that put the 43-year-old  in a chokehold

Twenty-four-year-old Erica posted Monday that she thought the fire had been set by 'evil people' and said the act was 'really sick'.

She later said that she wasn't accusing anyone of setting the fire.

Ms Garner called for an investigation into the incident and said the setback to the memorial 'only makes me stronger'.

A fire department spokesman said the blaze was an accident.

Thirty firefighters were able to close it out around 20 minutes after being called at 10:24pm Monday night, the Staten Island Advance reported.

Eric Garner's death from a chokehold by NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo in July brought national attention to the relationship between police and black men.

Garner was  pinned to the ground by police in the incident captured on video, in which he can be heard repeatedly saying 'I can't breathe'.

His death was ruled a homicide by the New York City medical examiner.

A subsequent non-indictment of Pantaleo by a Staten Island grand jury in December sparked a continuing series of protests against alleged police racism. 

The jury's decision followed on another controversial non-indictment of a white officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri.

The memorial to Garner, next to where he was confronted by police for selling loose cigarettes, is being rebuilt by his daughter.

A sign placed on the site Tuesday says, 'They burnt it down but will never wash the blood spilled.'' 

Erica Garner has also been involved in leading protests against police brutality under the slogan 'Black Lives Matter'.

She held a vigil of about 100 people with Rev Al Sharpton to honor her father on a day remembering a leader in African-American rights. 

Monday's holiday, which falls near the Nobel Peace Prize-winner's birthday, saw protests in numerous US cities repeating Dr King's call for racial equality, including a march of more than 1,000 people in New York.

A petition for President Barack Obama to invite Eric Garner's family to the State of the Union address gathered more than 49,000 signatures, though the relatives were ultimately did not attend Congress to see the speech.
