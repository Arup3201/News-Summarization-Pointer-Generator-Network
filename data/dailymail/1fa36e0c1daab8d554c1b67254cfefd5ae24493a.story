A British Muslim convert accused of travelling to Pakistan for terrorism training discussed targeting Royal Wootton Bassett, a court today.

The Wiltshire town, where mourners turned out to pay their respects to troops killed in Afghanistan, was among possible targets allegedly talked about by Richard Dart, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told.

Other targets he is accused of discussing include officers from MI5 and MI6.

Muslim convert Richard Dart, aka Salahuddin Al Britani, is one of four British Muslims charged with terror offences who was remanded in custody today

Dart, from Broadway, Ealing, and two 
other men, have been charged with preparing for acts of terrorism 
between July 2010 and July 2012.

The bearded 29-year-old, who wore 
green Islamic robes under a black fleece jacket in court today, appeared
 in a BBC documentary last year about his conversion to Islam.

He appeared alongside Imran Mahmood, 21, of Northolt, west London, and Jahangir Alom, 26, of Stratford, east London.

While Alom lives in Stratford where 
the Olympics will be held, Scotland Yard said none of the alleged 
offences was linked to the Games.

As well as the terrorism training 
allegation, they are accused of travelling abroad to commit acts of 
terrorism and advising and counselling the commission of terrorism acts 
by providing information about travel to Pakistan, terrorism training 
and operational security while there.

Also at the hearing at Westminster 
Magistratesâ€™ Court in London was Ruksana Begum, 22, of Islington, north London who was allegedly in
 possession of terrorist material.

Howard Riddle, the chief magistrate, remanded all four in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on July 31.

All four were arrested
 between July 5 and 7. They will appear at The Old Bailey on July 31.
