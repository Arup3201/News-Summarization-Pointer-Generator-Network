Agatha Christie's inspiration and a favourite hideaway on the coast of Devon, Burgh Island Hotel, will after all be fitted with 200 controversial solar panels following dramatic objections from locals. 

The proposed set of eco-panels have been described by a former owner as 'horrific' and a neighbour as 'a monstrous carbuncle on an old friend' during the development application process. 

But it has finally concluded with Bigbury-On-Sea parish council being over-ruled by its 'big brother' South Hams District Council, who have approved the addition.

The historic Burgh Island Hotel will have 200 controversial solar panels fitted after council gave approval

Fierce opposition by a former owner and local parish council was over-ruled by South Hams District officers

One person in opposition to the  changes claimed the 'Miss Marple' and 'Murder on the Orient Express' author would 'turn in her grave' at the thought of the 1930s Art Deco hotel near Sidmouth being 'scarred' by the 21st century solar panels.

But planners thought otherwise and have granted permission to current owners Tony Orchard and Deborah Clark to go ahead with the £50,000 project after they submitted revised plans. 

They say the panels would enable the hotel to produce 10 per cent of its heating and lighting bill from renewable energy - sustainable for the environment and their business.   

Mrs Clark said: 'The parish council of Bigbury has always been very hostile to anything we've proposed for Burgh Island. I think their opposition to this plan was borne out of malice.

'We're really pleased that common sense has prevailed. This is not a solar farm to sell energy to the grid, this is a small array to make our business more resilient to energy market fluctuations. It will help cut our energy bills by 10 per cent.'

Mrs Clark said she had considered a wind turbine for the island but instead went with a plan to use state-of-the-art solar panels from Exeter-based company SunGiftEnergy.

The beautiful island served as inspiration for the novels by legendary crime author Agatha Christie

The hotel was frequently visited by Christie, who used the setting as inspiration for a number of her novels including 'And Then There Were None' and 'Evil Under The Sun', a Hercules Poirot mystery.

Several local residents said the panels, which will be fitted on disused tennis courts, would spoil the beauty of the hotel. 

South Hams planning officers' report said: 'The sensitivity of Burgh Island is fully acknowledged.

'The proposed solar array would actually represent a very minor change to it. Any harm caused by the proposed development to the character of Burgh Island and its famous listed hotel is considered to be very slight.'

Mrs Clark said the panels should be in place by April once the finances for the scheme have been secured: 'This is a rational decision which we always thought would be made, correctly, on the grounds of public policy, political guidance, best practice and - most importantly - the desirability of sustainable energy for our country.

'Devon, and the West Country, are at the forefront of the sustainable energy drive and will be its standard bearer into the next decade.

'There are more homes and businesses using solar energy in the South West than in London.'

The project had received support from the National Trust and English Heritage, she said.

'We feel strongly that sustainable energy is best practice where ever it can be employed, even in the context of listed buildings.

'In this, we are following a modern and progressive path that would have been recognised by the original pioneers of Burgh Island in the 1920s and '30s.

'Burgh Island was one of the founder members of The Green Tourism Business Scheme, taking a Bronze award at its inception in 2003 and holding Gold since 2010.'

Parish councillor Rose Owen said while she agreed with the 'need for sustainability and finding alternative methods of producing power' the area is one of 'outstanding natural beauty.'

'It's a historic island so it is totally inappropriate and out of place,' she said.

Former owner Tony Porter, who sold the island in 2001, previously stated he was 'horrified' by the proposal and said the panels would have appalled Agatha Christie.

'We spent 16 years doing everything we could to restore it to its former beauty,' he said. 'Now this green island sleeping in the sun is going to be scarred by this horrible shiny thing. It will be visible from miles away. It is going to glint in the sun and spoil the whole thing.'

Mrs Clark says the council's decision was 'rational' after the Bigbury parish's hostile opposition to plans

The solar panels will be fitted on a disused tennis court and be obscured by hedges, says Mrs Clark

Mrs Clark says the panels will be non-reflective and be obscured by hedges.  

Hubert Ashton, whose home overlooks the island said: 'This would be a monstrous carbuncle on an old friend. It would be ruinous for the beauty of the island.'

Stuart Watts, of Bigbury Parish Council, said: 'As a feature the island is known around the world so this is bound to prove controversial and stir up a huge amount of interest.'

A spokesman for South Hams Council said: 'I don't think this type of planning application has been put forward for the island before, but every application is looked at individually on its merits.'

Burgh Island is about 820ft from Bigbury-on-Sea, and accessible by foot at low tide or by a sea tractor.
