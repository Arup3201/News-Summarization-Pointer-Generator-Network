Portugal may have been without superstar Cristiano Ronaldo but it was not less of a shock as they slumped to an embarrassing 1-0 defeat at home to Albania in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier. 

After a miserable World Cup campaign, which saw them bow out in the group phase, the hosts failed to bounce back as stunning volley from Bekim Balaj early in the second half decided the match. 

Even without Ronaldo the likes of Fabio Coentrao and Nani - who was the provider of their most encouraging moments - lined up for Portugal in the Group I clash, but couldn't muster a response.

Nani, on loan at Sporting Lisbon from Manchester United, whipped in a number of dangerous crosses and fired wide from inside the area as his side took the ascendancy without converting.

Greece 0-1 Romania

Germany 2-1 Scotland

Georgia 1-2 Republic of Ireland

Denmark 2 - 1 Armenia

Hungary 1 - 2 Northern Ireland

The home fans were silenced by a moment of magic seven minutes into the second half when Odise Roshi's cross from the right came in behind Balaj, who impressively rifled a right-footed volley on the turn into the bottom corner from 15 yards.

Ricardo Horta hit the post, Nani headed over from close range and Coentrao had a shot fumbled by Berisha, who also tipped over a shot from Andre Gomes, as Portugal chased the game and Albania held on. 

Perhaps an even greater shock was averted when Finland went 1-0 down to the Faroe Islands when Christian Holst found the back of the net just before half-time in their Group F meeting. 

Rosenborg striker Riku Riski came to the rescue though, first to equalise and then secure the lead before Roman Eremenko put the result beyond doubt late on. 

Hero: Romania's Ciprian Marica (left) celebrates scoring from the spot to take the lead against Greece

In a rematch of their World Cup qualifier Romania exacted revenge on Greece in their Group F opener. 

Ciprian Marica scored a 10th-minute penalty before being sent off by English referee Mark Clattenburg. 

But  Romania managed to hold on without him for a 1-0 win that gives them the best possible start to progress from a group including Northern Ireland and Hungary.

Denmark were spared another home embarrassment at the hands of Armenia as goals from Pierre Emile Hojbjerg and Thomas Kahlenberg secured the Scandinavians a come-from-behind 2-1 win in Group I.

Playing a nation who had pulled off a famous 4-0 victory over them at Parken during World Cup qualifying in 2013, the Danes looked set to be humbled by the Armenians in Copenhagen once again when Borussia Dortmund midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan's strike put the away side 1-0 up in the 50th minute.

However, Hojbjerg levelled 15 minutes later with a long-range effort, and with 10 minutes of the contest to go substitute Kahlenberg headed home the winner.
