If handed a floppy disk, most teenagers today wouldn't know what they were looking at.

But for those who work in the government, the storage devices used in early computing are alive and still very much in use.

According to a report in the New York Times, the Federal Register is still receiving couriered documents on floppy disks and CD-ROMs, despite technology existing that would digitize the process.

Get with the times: Some government agencies are still using floppy disks to submit paper work to the Federal Register

A branch of the National Archives, the Federal Register is the daily journal of the U.S. Government which prints public notices from government agencies.

Despite most computers not being able to process floppy disks, the staff at the Federal Register is still receiving some documents in floppy disk form because certain agencies haven't updated their technology.

The Federal Register Act requires agencies to submit documents on paper, CD-ROM or floppy disks - and there's even an option to create an digital signature and submit information over email.

Some agencies have updated to the new email system, but others haven't yet because it's expensive.

Flash drives or SD cards are ruled out, as they are not mentioned in the act.

Important documents: The Federal Register - the daily journal of the U.S. government - is a branch of the National Archives

The Register would like the law updated to include flash drives or SD cards, but until it's changed they are forced to continue accepting floppy disks.

'Some agencies move forward with technology, and that great. Other agencies aren't ready to go this year, maybe not next year,' Jim Bradley, assistant public printer for the Government Printing Office, told the New York Times. The Government Printing Office publishes the print version of the Register.

'You've got this antiquated system that still works but is not nearly as efficient as it could be,' said Stan Soloway, chief executive of the Professional Services Council, which represents more than 370 government contractors. 'Companies that work with the government, whether longstanding or newcomers, are all hamstrung by the same limitations.'
