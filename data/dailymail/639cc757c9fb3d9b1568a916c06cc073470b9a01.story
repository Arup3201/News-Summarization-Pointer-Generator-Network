Microsoft's next-generation Kinect sensor is able to detect and monitor a person's heart rate from around four feet away - without touching them.

As blood passes through a person's body, the skin changes colour ever so slightly and the new Kinect camera can recognise these changes to establish how fast the blood is pumping.

By knowing the speed of the blood, the camera can then determine how many beats per minute the heart needs to make in order to reach that speed.

As blood passes through a person's 
body, the skin changes colour ever so slightly.

The new Kinect camera
 can recognise these changes in colour in a person's face to establish how fast the blood is pumping.

By knowing the speed 
of the blood, the camera can then determine how many beats per minute 
the heart needs to make in order to reach that speed.

The feature is set to be used while players use fitness apps, but could also be used to measure how scared someone is during a film, for example.

Microsoft unveiled its Kinect sensor as part of its Xbox One event in June. The sensor will be sold with the new console and both are available from 22 November.

As well as the heartrate monitor, Microsoft's sensor has an increased 'field of view' that is now 60 per cent wider than the current Kinect.

It can read up to six skeletons at once, compared to the current two, and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better.

This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example.

The second-generation Kinect sensor is also able to see faces, track eye movements and detect expressions, although the range of emotions is limited to happy, neutral and disinterested during the beta release.

It is additionally said to be better at recognising features and body movements in the dark and dimly lit rooms because it uses what's called active infrared (IR).

IR works in a similar way to thermal imaging and is used in night-vision goggles, for example.

Other improvements that have been made include being able to tell which muscles are in use while the player uses a fitness app, for example, as well as the bodies orientation, pictured

Other improvements that have been made include being able to tell which muscles are in use while the player uses a fitness app, for example, and determine how much force is being applied when throwing a punch in a boxing game, or when jogging on the spot.

The stronger pressure on a muscle, the stronger the colour, which range from red for a 'stressed' muscle through to green when a muscle is relaxed.

Force is reflected in circles that appear around the limb throwing the kick or punch; the larger the circle, the stronger the force.

It can also track a person's orientation.
