A mother has released harrowing footage which shows the moment her motorcyclist son was killed instantly in a 97mph crash.

David Holmes, 38, was killed in June last year when a car turned into his path on the A47 in Honingham, Norfolk, where the speed limit is 60mph.

The devastating moment was captured on the camera which he wore on his crash helmet. Mr Holmes's last word, uttered seconds before impact, was 'whoa'. 

Now his mother Brenda, 62, has decided to release the footage in a bid to stop others going through the same agony of losing a family member.

A mother has released harrowing footage showing the moment her motorcyclist son was killed in 97mph crash on the A47 in Honingham, Norfolk

The devastating moment was captured by the camera which he wore on his crash helmet. The car is seen turning into his path as Mr Holmes drives along the road

The last word that he utters seconds before the impact - 'whoa' - can be heard on camera 

The retired nurse wants both motorcyclists and drivers to be more aware of each other on the roads, to stop more crashes like this taking place.

She said that the driver - who has since admitted causing death by careless driving - did not see the motorcyclist, but that Mr Holmes, who was driving nearly 40mph over the speed limit, also did not have time to take 'evasive action'.

She said: 'I want to be involved in this campaign because I feel something positive can come out of his loss.

'If we can prevent one accident; one family going through what we have been through then David would not have died in vain. It is not easy to do but I hope somebody benefits from seeing it.' 

Mr Holmes was travelling back from King's Lynn, Norfolk, where he had been with colleagues.

He overtook several cars on his powerful bike in the minutes leading up to the fatal crash. He was thrown from his Yamaha FJR1300 into the trees and pronounced dead at the scene.

Speaking about the crash, his mother said: 'I know he rode fast that day. He loved speed and motorbikes. 

'The driver did not see him and turned right across his path. David did not have time to take evasive action.'  

In the video, Mrs Holmes tells how her son, who worked at the British Antarctic Survey and had recently returned from The Antarctic, was first bought a motorbike for his 16th birthday.

She said: 'We brought it back home in the back of his Dad's truck, He was jumping up and down with excitement. It was fabulous. A lovely, lovely memory.

His mother Brenda, 62, has agreed for the footage to be released as part of a police road safety campaign

'Although his father said he wishes he had never bought him that first bike, I would not have deprived David his 22 years of riding.'

She said he was 'the most wonderful son' and was described by his friends as a 'gentleman and a legend'.  

Chief Inspector Chris Spinks, head of the Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit, said he was 'confident' that the clip would save a life.

In just three days, the video, recorded on the motocyclist's camera, has been watched by almost 4.5million people. 

He said: 'David's family have always been of the belief that if this video could save just one life then it would be worth it.

'Unfortunately, we'll never know if we have achieved this but I'm confident, with the level of interest that we will.'

Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pictured, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving

In April this year, Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving. 

He was subsequently ordered to perform 130 hours of unpaid work. His driving licence was also suspended for 18 months.

The court heard Austin admitted he had not seen Mr Holmes before making the turn. 

In passing sentence, Judge Veits said no one had suggested Austin had been driving dangerously, but he had made a mistake that 'sadly' too many other drivers also make, of 'simply' not seeing the motorcycle.

Headded: 'Nothing I can impose can turn the clock back and undo the tragic consequences of the accident that sadly took away the life of Mr Holmes. I only hope the family of Mr Holmes can now move on as this case is concluded and attempt to rebuild their lives.'
