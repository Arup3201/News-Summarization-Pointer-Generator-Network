Crisis club Blackpool are finally closing in on a keeper after launching a move for Joe Lewis from Cardiff.

Though it is understood to be a loan deal, rather than a permanent transfer, under-fire chairman Karl Oyston will be relieved to have ended the search for a number one, so close to the start of the new season.

Cardiff’s 26-year old former England Under 21 keeper, signed from Peterborough two years ago, is expected to arrive at Bloomfield Road on a season-long loan in the next 24 hours, provided there is no last-minute hitch.

On the move: Cardiff goalkeeper Joe Lewis is on the verge of a season-long loan move to Blackpool

Oyston will be desperately hoping it does go through after an embarrassing lack of senior players led to calls for his head from exasperated Blackpool fans, who have seen their club installed as the bookies’ favourites for relegation.

The Tangerines have boosted their squad with the permanent signings of Jacob Mellis, Peter Clarke and Tomasz Cywka, plus the loan capture of West Brom's Donervon Daniels.
