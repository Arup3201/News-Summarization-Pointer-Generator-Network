If Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were looking for a follow-up story four decades on, then this could be a very helpful new source.

More than 36 years after Richard Nixon told a secret grand jury about the Watergate scandal, his testimony was ordered to be released by a judge because of its significance in American history.

Stanley Kutler, who has written several books about Mr Nixon and Watergate, put in a request with others to unseal the testimony given by the former president on June 23 and 24 in 1975.

Mr Nixon was questioned about the 1970s political scandal that resulted from the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington D.C.

The scandal caused him to leave office in August 1974 and he remains the only U.S. president to resign. It also resulted in the indictment, trial, conviction and jailing of some of his top officials.

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that special circumstances, especially the undisputed historical interest in Mr Nixon's testimony, far outweighed the need to keep the records secret.

‘Watergate significance in American history cannot be overstated,’ Judge Lamberth wrote.

‘The disclosure of (his) grand jury 
testimony would likely enhance the existing historical record, foster 
scholarly discussion and improve the public's understanding of a 
significant historical event.’

Judge Lamberth added that the scandal continues to attract both scholarly and public interest – and it is right to reveal the testimony despite the fact that grand jury proceedings typically remain secret.

President Barack Obama’s Justice Department had opposed releasing the testimony, citing privacy interests of individuals named in the testimony - but Judge Lamberth said these were minimal.

He said Nixon died 17 years ago, many other key figures likely to be mentioned were deceased and most of the surviving figures have spoken publically or testified under oath about their involvement.

Allison Zieve, director of the Public
Citizen Litigation Group and the lead attorney for those seeking the 
testimony, said this will be a significant step toward completing 
Watergate's historical record.

‘President Nixon's knowledge of the 
events and role in the cover-up remains a subject of speculation for 
historians, journalists and others,’ she said.

Mr Nixon answered questions about the 
18-and-a-half minute gap in a White House recording of his conversation 
with a top aide after the break-in, according to news reports at the 
time.

He also reportedly talked about altering White House tape transcripts turned over to the House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment inquiry.

Other subjects included using the Internal Revenue Service to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes.

Mr Nixon's grand jury transcript will not be released immediately because the government will have the opportunity to appeal.

Government lawyers are now reviewing the ruling.
