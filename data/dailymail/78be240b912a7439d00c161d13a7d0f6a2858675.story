Imbalance: Woman spend 18 per cent more of their time on activities including housework and childcare in comparison to men (file picture)

For any worn-out mothers stealing a 
glance at this story in between vacuuming the living room, sorting out 
the washing and cooking dinner, it will probably come as little 
surprise.

British women do 
more unpaid housework and childcare than most other women around the 
world, according to research – devoting more time to domestic duties 
than the industrious Chinese.

In
 a week, British women spend an average of 11 more hours on household 
matters than their husbands do, while putting in three hours less in 
paid work.

In China, women 
invest eight hours more a week in housework than their husbands do, 
while the men give an average of three hours more to their jobs.

The
 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development puts the UK at 
19th place out of 28 in its table of gender equality in household 
chores.

Couples in countries
 including the United States, South Africa, Finland, Estonia, Ireland, 
Hungary, Poland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, 
Slovenia, Austria, Belgium and Denmark all split the housework more 
evenly than we do.

Meanwhile,
 Italy – which has one of the lowest birth rates in the western world – 
has the biggest gender gap when it comes to carving up chores. Italian 
women clock up 21 hours more per week than men on housework.

They
 are followed by Japan (21 hours), India (18 hours), Spain (15 hours), 
New Zealand, Turkey and Canada (all 14 hours), Korea (13.5 hours) Mexico
 (13 hours) and France (12.5 hours).

On average, women put in 31.5 hours a week of unpaid work across the nations belonging to the OECD. Men do just 21 hours of unpaid work, but put in more hours in their day jobs – 33.7 against women’s 24.5.

The
 Better Life Index report concludes: ‘Women continue to bear the brunt 
of household tasks despite their increasing participation in the labour 
market.

'As time is a scarce resource, more time devoted to unpaid work 
often means less leisure, with negative consequences on wellbeing.’

It
 warned that ‘large responsibilities for household work impinge 
directly on women’s decisions to participate in the labour market, the
 hours they put in and their investment in human capital, reinforcing 
gender inequalities in access to economic opportunities and resources’.

It
 also leads to the ‘double burden of holding a job and looking after the
 family [which] can generate time deprivation and stress, with negative 
effects on life satisfaction and health’ for women.

Unsurprisingly,
 women were also more likely to have less time to spend on having fun 
and looking after themselves.

Catching up: Men are sharing more of the household chores, but are more likely to multitask by watching sport while looking after the children

Those with children were described as the 
most ‘time poor’.

Every child generated a reduction in discretionary 
time for women of 2.3 hours a week but just 1.7 hours for men across the
 OECD.

Researchers also 
found women were more likely to multitask by carrying out two domestic 
tasks at the same time, such as cooking and childcare.

Men, on the other
 hand, would combine one chore with a ‘leisure’ task, such as ‘looking 
after the children while reading the newspaper’.

‘As a result, men tend to associate more positive feelings with multitasking than women do,’ the report concluded.

But
 overall women in the OECD countries are spending less time on housework
 than they were a decade ago, dropping 2.6 hours a week while bumping up
 their time at the office by one hour.

Men’s
 paid work, meanwhile, has decreased by 4.5 hours a week and they have 
increased the time spent on domestic chores by two hours.

Women
 are also now more likely to hire cleaners, nannies or childminders 
while buying more ready meals or eating out to cut down on the amount of
 time spent on unpaid household tasks.
