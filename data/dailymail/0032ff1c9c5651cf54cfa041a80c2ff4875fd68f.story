Everton appear to be on the brink of announcing their second summer signing as Ferencvaros midfielder Muhamed Besic has joined the club's pre-season trip to Thailand.

Besic, 21, represented Bosnia-Herzegovina in the World Cup and has been a target for Everton boss Roberto Martinez as he looks to add to a squad which he guided to a fifth place Barclays Premier League finish last season.

Although Besic will not feature in a friendly against Leicester in Bangkok, Martinez is pleased to have the former Hamburg man in amongst his current squad.

On the move: Everton are closing in on the Â£4million signing of Bosnia international Muhamed Besic

International: Besic, who signs from Hungarian side Ferencvaros, appeared at this summer's World Cup

'The next few days will allow Mo to meet the players,' the Spaniard told Everton's official website.

'But more importantly it is an opportunity for him to get into optimum condition ahead of the new season.

'I
 am looking forward to introducing him to the Everton fans when we come 
back but first I would like to thank Ferencvaros for the way in which 
they have approached the negotiations.

'They have been very understanding at this point and we have enjoyed a good working relationship.'

Once
 the deal has been confirmed, Besic will become the second summer 
acquisition for Martinez, joining Gareth Barry at Goodison Park after 
the England international made his successful loan move to the Toffees 
permanent at the start of the month.
