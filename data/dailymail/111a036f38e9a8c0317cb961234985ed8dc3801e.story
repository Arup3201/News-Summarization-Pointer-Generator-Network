These errie pictures show how a once-magnificent  orphanage backed by stars of the silver screen has been left to rot for a decade after plans to turn into a clinic for paedophiles were blocked by the local community.

Grade Two listed  Silverlands was once an orphanage home to 60 destitute children and supported by the likes of Noel Coward, Sir Laurence Olivier and Richard Attenborough.

The ornate chandeliers that hangs precariously from the ceilings and the mahogany panelling now are the only hints of the house's former grandeur.

Despite,its glamours past the property in Chertsey, Surrey, now has boarded up windows and mould growing on the walls, as nature threatens to reclaim it.

'I wanted to photograph an abandoned orphanage because of the idea behind it,' said online blogger Stacey Louise, 21, who explored the abandoned property with her partner Tim Barber, 31.

'I liked the fact that the place children were left at has now been left itself - almost as if the building has become an orphan.

The Neo-Georgian entrance hall has survived the years of neglect and the staircase leads to what were once the bedrooms of the orphans house there

'A place that once was filled with children and some happy times now alone and lost, hidden from people and forgotten.'

Silverlands was originally built in 1814 by Surrey brewer Robert Porter, before being largely rebuilt by its second owner Vice Admiral Sir Henry Hotham.

The three storey home was extended by its third owner Sir John Brunner, who lived here between 1907-8 and 1919, and was believed to have added the grand Neo-Georgian panelled entrance lobby and library.

It became home to the Actors Orphanage in 1938, who aimed to board, clothe and educate destitute children of actors and actresses. The Fund's first President was the eminent actor, Sir Henry Irving.

Two years later the children were evacuated to New York following the outbreak of World War II.

The orphans, thanks to Noel Coward, were sent to the Edwin Gould Foundation in New York, where they stayed for the entire conflict.

IN 1945, the Actors Orphanage Fund returned to Silverlands after the Germans surrendered to Allied forces. In the early 1940s a nursing school was also established at the site to train staff for nearby hospitals.

In 1956 Laurence Olivier took over as president of the Fund and Richard Attenborough served as his deputy. Together the pair introduced many changes at the home. 

They instigated changes, including the old dormitories being partitioned into individual cubicles each furnished with a new bed, small bureau and mirror. 

The children were divided into 'family groups' each containing a mixture of boys and girls of different ages and placed under the supervision of house parents. 

Each group had its own sitting room and dining room. The children were also allowed to choose some of their own clothes, listen to pop music, and hold or attend Saturday night dances. 

The Ministry of Justice had planned to turn Silverlands into a clinic for paedophiles in the late nineties, but were forced to abandon their plans following opposition from local people

In 1958 facing rising repair costs the orphanage closed its doors, but the nursing school remained until the 1990s. 

The site lay empty until the late nineties when the Ministry of Justice announced plans to turn it into a clinic for paedophiles and sex offenders.

The proposal was met by strong opposition from the local community and the proposals were eventually abandoned in 2002 after a series of candle light vigils.

Silverlands has been left to rot ever since.

The entrance hall to Silverlands, dates back to the early 20th Century and is in a Neo-Georgian style, with full height panelling

Despite years of neglect the elaborate early 20th Century Neo-Georgian entrance hall, with fall height panelling, remains, as does the main stair case, which features carved oak balustrades.

One ground floor rooms has an Adam-style plastered ceiling and columns dating back to around 1845, another has early 20th Century dado panelling, doorcase.

 'I tried to visit the abandoned orphanage a couple of years ago and ended up being chased out by security guards and the police,' said Mr Barber, who captured the images in the middle of the night.

'Going back was always on the cards, this place has always been on the 'to do' list because of what it was and what it once had meant to so many people and families.

The walls inside one of the gathering rooms have started to crumble after years of neglect.

Mould appears to be growing on the walls of this hall. Photographer Tim Barber said: 'To me, these pictures capture a time that has been long forgotten.'

'What was particularly astonishing was the centrepiece of the building where the huge grand oak staircase stood with beautiful ornate chandeliers hanging over it.

'The inside was very grand and, in its day, would have been very impressive.

'To me, these pictures capture a time that has been long forgotten.

'The people who walked the corridors and stairs have long since left and nature has started to consume what is left of the building.

'I see a place whose purpose has become void and now is destined to be forgotten by the world.'

Silverlands has been left rotting ever since.
