A former Mob associate who spent over a decade posing as a cattle rancher in Idaho has been convicted in a string of federal charges, including the attempted murder of a man who became the boss of the New England Mafia.

Enrico Ponzo was convicted in a racketeering indictment after a month-long trial.

Prosecutors said Ponzo teamed up with a faction of mobsters that wanted to stop Francis 'Cadillac Frank' Salemme from becoming the boss of the Patriarca crime family.

Prosecutors said Ponzo teamed up with a faction of mobsters that wanted to stop Salemme from becoming the boss of the Patriarca crime family, the New England branch of the Mafia.

Ponzo was convicted of being one of the triggermen who shot at Salemme in 1989 as he walked into a pancake house in Saugus, north of Boston. Salemme survived the shooting.

Ponzo fled in 1994 and wasn’t captured until 2011, when authorities found him in Marsing, Idaho, where he owned a handful of cows on a small ranch and neighbors knew him as Jay Shaw.

In opening statements to the jury last month, a prosecutor said Ponzo was an associate in the Patriarca family who participated in extortions, assaults and attempted murders while rival factions were vying for control of the organized crime group in the late 1980s and early ‘90s.

Prosecutors said Ponzo re-invented himself after he fled Massachusetts, first as a large-scale marijuana distributor in Arizona, then as a cattle rancher in Idaho.

Ponzo’s lawyer, however, said he was not a made member or an associate of the Mafia. The defense also challenged the credibility of the government’s witnesses, including mob figures who made deals with prosecutors for reduced sentences.

Ponzo’s lawyer, John Cunha Jr., also told the jury that Ponzo left Massachusetts because he believed he was on a hit list created by a mobster whose son was shot to death.

Cunha said he plans to appeal.

'The jury worked hard. They obviously gave great care since they found him not guilty on a number of things as well as guilty on other things,' he said. 'Nevertheless, it’s a disappointment.'

Verdict: Enrico M Ponzo, left, who was known as Jay Shaw was found guilty and will be sentenced in March

Ponzo was convicted of being one of the 
triggermen who shot at Salemme in 1989 as he walked into a pancake house
in Saugus, north of Boston. He was acquitted of several other charges.

Ponzo fled in 1994 and wasn't captured until 2011, when authorities found him in Marsing, Idaho.

With his East Coast accent and tales 
of living in New York, Ponzo lived under an assumed name, Jay Shaw.

He stood out when he moved to the tiny farm
town but he was friendly enough, even helpful, to his neighbors, and they never suspected him of having a dark secret.

After
about a decade of living the quiet life of a would-be cattle rancher, 
his past closed in on him one day in 2011 as he was negotiating a 
purchase of hay near his 12-acre ranch.

Massachusetts authorities had caught up with him, more than 16 years after he disappeared.

His real name was Enrico Ponzo, and he was wanted on numerous federal charges in a racketeering indictment, including the 1989 attempted murder of Francis 'Cadillac Frank' Salemme, who went on to become the boss of the Patriarca crime family.

His former neighbors in Idaho have been watching news coverage of the trial over the last month. Some are still stunned that the novice rancher they knew was accused of being mixed up with mobsters in Boston.

'It was almost unbelievable,' said 
farmer Bob Briggs, who was talking about hay with Ponzo when he was 
arrested. 'People couldn't understand why and what for and how come.'

In
Idaho, where he had lived for a little over a decade, Ponzo owned a 
handful of cows and spent a lot of time with his two young children.

'He
told me he was from New York and that he had been in the Army,' said 
Briggs, who farmed land across from where Ponzo lived and got to know 
him.

In August 2010, Ponzo's longtime girlfriend Cara Pace left with their kids and moved to another state.

'It
almost killed him,' Briggs said. 'He took care of them, he fed them, he
did everything for them. He was just devastated when she took the 
kids.'

Ponzo was wanted for the attempted murder of Francis Salemme, a mob boss turned government informant who is now believed to be in the witness protection program

Six months later, Ponzo was arrested.

'It was almost unbelievable,' Briggs said. 'I sure had him pegged wrong.'

Prosecutors
said Ponzo was a mob associate who teamed up with a faction of mobsters
that wanted to stop Salemme from becoming the boss.

In a 1997 indictment, Ponzo and 
Vincent Marino are named as the triggermen who shot at Salemme as he 
walked into an IHOP in Saugus, north of Boston. Ponzo was among 15 
people indicted by a grand jury investigating organized crime.

During
the late '80s and early '90s, Ponzo and his co-conspirators 
participated in extortions, assaults and attempted murders while rival 
factions were vying for control of the crime group.

Ponzo will be sentenced in March.
