Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton checked out of Lenox Hill hospital in Manhattan this evening, three days after giving birth to a new baby girl named Charlotte.

Chelsea beamed as she exited the Upper East Side hospital, cradling little Charlotte swaddled in a maternity ward blanket, and flanked by husband Marc Mezvinsky.

The former first daughter wore a bright blue and dress for the special occasion, paired with royal blue flats. 

First-time grandparents Bill and Hillary Clinton stood behind their daughter, proudly smiling and waving to the crowd gathered.

Someone in the crowd watching said, 'God bless you, man' to the former president, who mouthed back, 'thank you'. 

Before the former first family left the hospital, a member of their security team put a booster seat in one of the family's black SUVs.

Little Charlotte will have a room waiting at her parents lux $10million apartment just a few miles south in the Flatiron District, near Madison Square Park.

For the next few days, it's likely Charlotte will be doted on as first-time grandparents Bill and Hillary have cleared their schedules to bond with the latest member of the Clinton clan.

The former president and his potential candidate wife arrived separately at the hospital today, waving for cameras as they made their way inside to see their daughter in her plush maternity suite - which reportedly costs thousands of dollars a night.

It came as political allies - who had been hoping for an appearance - accepted that the new birth takes priority. 

New Hampshire state senator Lou D'Allesandro today confirmed to CNN that Hillary had pulled out of a fundraiser tomorrow, telling the network: 'Baby came, family first'.

Chelsea Clinton and husband Marc Mezvinsky are taking their new baby girl home today to their $10million flat in Manhattan's fashionable Flatiron District.

The couple bought the home in the beautiful Whitman Building, near Madison Square Park, just a year ago - relocating from their last $4million apartment just a block away.

The $5,000-square-foot apartment occupies an entire floor of the building, and comes with four bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, home office and den.

The interior of the home is lit with natural light, thanks to the floor to ceiling windows that look over the nearby greenspace.

The Mezvinsky's also have their own 252-square-foot terrace to baby proof.

Other amenities of the building little Charlotte is not likely to take advantage of include a residents-only gym, full-time doorman and refrigerated package room.

Bill has already bowed out of a scheduled appearance to help Senator Mark Udall at a fundraising  event in Colorado. 

Both Democrats are locked in tight re-election battles with their Republican challengers. He has been travelling around the country to help the party this year. 

Chelsea gave birth at 7.03pm Friday night, and announced the news a few hours later. Bill and Hillary met their granddaughter for the first time the following day, and shared photographs of them cooing over the baby, declaring themselves 'over the moon'.

'We are in love': Chelsea Clinton posted this picture of her holding Charlotte with new father Marc Mezvinsky standing behind her

Moments before, Chelsea had shared the first picture of her daughter, which showing her cradling the baby next to her husband, investment banker Marc Mezvinsky. 

The couple, who married in July 2010, announced in April that they were expecting their first child.

Bill and Hillary had been publicly gushing for months at the prospect of becoming grandparents, though Chelsea's exact due date had been kept quiet.

In a recent TV interview, former President Bill said: 'I hope by the first of October, I'll be a grandfather.' He has since been proved right.

Last week, Hillary Clinton also excited fans as she told a crowd at political steak fry in Indianola, Iowa: 'Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch. So don't be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage.

'I want to babysit any chance I get,' she added.

When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.

'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders,' she added.

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.'
