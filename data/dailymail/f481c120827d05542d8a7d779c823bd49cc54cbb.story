They are 13 little bundles of fluff, all wriggly and bursting with mischief.

Their coats are so soft it is like stroking silk. By the time they've grown up, however, things will have changed dramatically for this landmark litter of Bergamasco puppies.   

For soon, they will look just like mum and dad. And that means spending the rest of their lives like a pile of raggedy old mop-heads sewn together on legs. Which, it transpires, is precisely what nature intended.  

Landmark: Chris Walker's dog Ella gave birth to a litter of 13 Bergamasco puppies - a record

'Bob Marley': Bergamasco puppy Winston, left, and its siblings all have silky soft fur now, but when they are fully grown their fur will resemble dreadlocks just like this adult Bergamasco, right

The rare breed was originally used to safeguard sheep in the Italian Alps. That coat might bear an uncanny resemblance to the one Rolling Stone Brian Jones famously sported in the 1960s, but up there in the mountains, it just as essential a part of the dog's wardrobe as a fleece is to a lamb.

Not only does it keep Bergamascos warm and dry, it camouflages them against the terrain.

Rare: The litter of Bergamasco pups are seen at feeding time

The unique dreadlocks – far more Bob Marley than Bob Martin - are matted so tightly they also protect against predators such as snakes, which struggle to penetrate the six-inch long felts.   

Okay, so it makes them look a little like living compost heaps, or a character out of the Muppets. But the lucky 13 born two months ago to the splendidly named:  Ella av Villrosebakken of Calshair (that's her in the black outfit) are ambassadors for an important new generation of the breed. 

There were estimated to be only around 30 dogs in the UK, and no guarantee that they would endure in this country.

Even with less stringent 'pet passport' restrictions on bringing dogs into Britain, it can still take years to import one.

Record: Bergamascos like Itchy (front) and Joel love children and are highly protective towards them

Snug: Two of the sleepy puppies stretch and yawn in a basket

Baker's dozen: Chris Walker gives puppy Isabel a peck - Ms Walker's dog Ella increased the UK population of Bergamascos by almost 50 per cent with her litter of 13

There is currently a three to four year waiting list of hopefuls waiting to pay around £1,000 a pup, and some have already given up. 

Then along came Ella's remarkable baker's dozen – the first UK litter for at least six years.

It was a record breaking achievement that increased the population by nearly 50 per cent at a stroke.

'When we looked at the scan of Ella we could tell there were five in the womb, maybe six,' said proud owner Mrs Chris Walker.

'When she gave birth, the first puppy was breeched. After that, they just kept on coming. No-one ever expected 13. I feel very honoured.'

Plans to mate Chris's other bitch, Biaga, were thwarted by medical difficulties, so she now acts as auntie to the pups.

Instead, the 13 were the product of a mating between Ella and the magnificent Jude, owned by breeder and Bergamasco expert Reyna Knight.

At present they have the run of a large, oak-beamed conservatory at Chris's barn-conversion home on the edge of Plymouth, Devon, which she shares with the dogs and her surgeon husband Alasdair.

On the prowl: There is a waiting list of between three and four years for a Bergamasco like Elizabeth

Playful: Homes are gradually being found for the 13 adorable puppies

Distinctive: Sunshine, who has light brown fur with black patches, plays in the garden

When we arrive the puppies are sleeping. Not for long though. Several seem to find my leather boots irresistible to eat (although not as attractive as photographer Lucy Ray's  ponytail, which seldom has fewer than two puppies chewing it as she gets down to their level with a camera).

Trying to line up 13 puppies proves to be as easy as balancing 13 rugby balls end-up on a slope.

Every time you think you've got one in place, it tumbles off somewhere else.

The one Chris calls Cheeky delights in living up to her name. Marshmallow, also known as Adolf (he has one undescended testicle) likes to eat cameras.

Itchy (he scratches) has gone behind a screen for a poo. Several hours later, as the pups get sleepy, photographing them becomes marginally easier, although it's still nothing short of chaos.

Meanwhile mum and auntie are doing flying carpet impersonations in a field as they bound off for a walk.

Soon, however, peace will descend once again in the Walker household.

Adult: Plans to mate Ms Walker's other bitch, Biaga, were thwarted by medical difficulties, so the dreadlocked dog now acts as 'auntie' to the pups

Shaggy: Impressive adult Bergamasco Biaga jumps for a ball, displaying its dreadlocks to full effect

The puppies are gradually being found homes. One will go a trainee minister in Scotland; he plans to take the dog with him on pastoral visits to his flock.

Another is heading for a family with an autistic son. Bergamascos love children and are highly protective towards them.

A third is earmarked for a woman who loves dogs but is allergic to them. She discovered she is completely immune to the Bergamasco's unique coat after spending the day with Biaga, Ella and her litter.  

And the next generation of Bermascos? That's clearly going to be another chapter in what could, with luck, be a long running shaggy dog story.
