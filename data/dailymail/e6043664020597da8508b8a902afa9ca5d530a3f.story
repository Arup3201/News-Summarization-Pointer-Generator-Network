The NHS has been forced to spend £1m on super-sized CT scanners to deal with the escalating obesity crisis.

The new machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat - and the weight they can take has nearly doubled from 25st (160kg) to 47st (300kg).

Around 65 per cent of people in England are now overweight or obese - and the NHS already spends an estimated £5.1billion a year treating obesity-related illnesses.

CT scans use X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body.

More detailed than standard X-rays, the scans can produce images of 
structures inside the body, including the internal organs, blood 
vessels, bones and tumours.

The new super-size machines also scan at twice the speed than conventional ones, The Mirror reported.

This is significant as patients are usually required to hold their breath during the scan - since chest movement can affect the image - and some obese people can find it harder to hold their breath.

A recent report on CT scanners compiled by Siemens Healthcare found that over the past two decades, the weight allowance of imaging tables has increased by 88 per cent.

X ray generator power, which contributes to scanners providing a good quality image despite the patient’s size, has increased by 380 per cent - from around 50KW to 240KW .

The size of the bore, where the patient lies, has increased from 70cm to 80cm.

Commenting on the report, Russell Lodge,
 CT Business Manager at Siemens Healthcare, said: 'The number of 
bariatric patients being referred for CT scans has more than doubled in 
the last 25 years and this is predicted to continue rising.

A computerised tomography (CT) scan uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body.

CT scans are also sometimes known as CAT scans, which stands for computerised axial tomography.

During a CT scan, which is painless and takes five to 10 minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned, patients lie on their backs on a bed.

The scanner consists of an X-ray tube that rotates around the body and the patient is usually moved continuously through this rotating beam.

The X-rays are received by a detector on the opposite side of the body and an image of the scan will be produced by a computer.

The images produced by a CT scan are called tomograms and are more detailed than standard X-rays.

'We have witnessed a growing need and 
demand for obesity provision from hospital imaging departments across 
the country to ensure patients of all sizes can gain access to the 
treatment they need.'

One large hospital in the North East of England recently purchased a £1m super-sized scanner, according to The Mirror.

Figures released earlier this year by Public Health England revealed this is the fattest region, where 68 per cent are overweight or obese.

And in June, a Freedom of Information request found rising obesity levels are forcing health bosses to spend millions of pounds adapting hospitals and buying specialist equipment to handle larger patients.

Money is being been spent on reinforced beds, wider corridors and even larger morgue fridges as a result of the obesity epidemic.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'The rapidly expanding size of CT scanners is shocking, but sadly, not surprising.

'But it is absolutely tragic that as a nation we are becoming so fat we are having to redesign medical equipment.'

Two years ago it was reported that NHS hospitals had been forced to ask zoos and vets to scan patients who were too obese to fit into hospital scanners.

The Royal Veterinary College said at the time that its CT scanners, customised for horses, could be 
used to accommodate patients weighing 30 stone or more but they would 
need to get a special licence to scan humans.
