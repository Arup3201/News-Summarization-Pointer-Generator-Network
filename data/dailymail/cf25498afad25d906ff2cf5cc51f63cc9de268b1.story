It is one of Angelina Jolie’s favourite photographs, an inspirational and iconic image of defiance and pride in the face of danger.

Taken by award-winning British photojournalist Tom Stoddart at the height of the Balkans war in a suburb of Sarajevo haunted by snipers, the woman walks tall in her heels and best clothes refusing to cower to the gunmen of Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic who daily picked-off their targets from the hills above the city.

Make-up was unobtainable in the besieged and shattered Bosnian capital, yet Meliha Vareshanovic had somehow made her own lipstick and eye-liner and would daily walk through the frontlines clutching her handbag, past the sandbagged positions and local defence forces in a remarkable example of the human spirit in adversity.

'You will never defeat us': Meliha Vareshanovic walks proudly and defiantly to work in the dangerous suburb of Dobrinja during the siege of Sarajevo in Angelina Jolie's favourite photograph

Haunting images: Sarajevans run for cover during shooting in 'Sniper Alley' in 1992, when award-winning British photojournalist Tom Stoddart immersed himself in the action at the height of the Balkans war

Joyful moment: Sedija Katica, who lost both legs after being hit by a grenade, plays with her five-year-old daughter, Amra, near the frontline in Sarajevo in 1994

Tears of anguish: A mother prepares to send her confused child out of Sarajevo on a bus promised safe passage by the Serb forces during the siege in 1992

In a city of desperate people who 
braved the streets behind sniper blankets, Vareshanovic stood out among a
population whose clothes and faces were scarred by war.

Such
was the impact of the photograph that it is said to have ‘inspired’ 
Hollywood star Jolie when she was making the acclaimed and controversial
film Land of Blood and Honey. A large print of the photograph hung on 
the wall of her suite as she edited the film.

Inspiration: British photojournalist Tom Stoddart (left) chronicled the everyday bravery of people in war zones, inspiring Angelina Jolie (right, with an elderly Bosnian woman). The actress visited post-conflict Bosnia as a special envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 

Thousands
of visitors to London are now seeing the photograph as part of a free 
open-air display near City Hall on the south side of the Thames, which 
runs throughout the Games.

It
is among 78 photographs - 74 black and white, four colour - taken by 
Stoddart on assignment around the world over the last two decades, which
form the exhibition created with the participation of the International
Committee of the Red Cross ICRC, to highlight their Health Care in 
Danger campaign.

Stoddart
said: ‘The world’s nations are joined together in a wonderful sporting 
festival whose motto is "swifter, higher, stronger". I hope that people 
visiting the exhibition will leave with a greater determination to 
understand and help those with little access to clean water, food and 
medicines who, through no fault of their own, cannot run more swiftly, 
jump higher or be stronger.’

Bright lights: RAF Greenham Common, near Newbury, Berkshire, in December 1983, when armed guards and dogs patrolled the barbed wired perimeter fence as campaigners tried to stop the deployment of nuclear missiles

Defiance: A lone demonstrator rests as police form lines to protect a coking plant at Orgreave near Sheffield. The 'Battle of Orgreave', in which up to 5,000 miners fought with police, was one of the most violent episodes of the 1984 miners' strike

Illicit trade: A pile of ivory confiscated from poachers by Kenyan Game Wardens valued at $3million. This picture was taken in Nairobi in July 1989

Breaking down barriers: The first section of the Berlin Wall is pushed down by the hands of crowds of determined people on the morning of November 10, 1989

Revolutionary spirit: Inmates demonstrate about poor conditions on the roof of Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow in 1990

Disturbing: With the Chinese athletes and gymnasts dominating much of the Olympics and topping the medal table, emotive photographs taken by Tom Stoddart of youngsters training in the 1990s are proving of particular interest to visitors

Haunting: Promising young gymnasts are taken away from their homes - their parents can see their children as little as once a year - and put into strict training camps, sharing accommodation and working on repetition exercises for hours each day

History in the making: A supporter at a 1994 ANC rally in South Africa peers from behind a sign bearing the image of their President Nelson Mandela

With the Chinese athletes and gymnasts dominating much of the Olympics and topping the medal table, stunning but disturbing photographs taken by Stoddart of youngsters in training in four major cities are proving of particular interest to the 5,000 from around the world visiting the display each day.

Promising young gymnasts are taken away from their homes – their parents can see their children as little as once a year – and put into strict training camps, sharing accommodation and working on repetition exercises for hours each day.

The haunting photographs taken in the 1990s capture perfectly the lengths the training programmes go to in order to create Olympic champions – and the apparent pain the youngsters endure.

A YouTube site has been created for visitors to the display to post comments and, with the Olympics at the uppermost of the nation's thoughts, the Chinese images have drawn particular attention.

Other works attracting comment are 
Stoddart’s pictures of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the historic 
election of Nelson Mandela, the aftermath of the tsunami and the 
devastation of Lockerbie.

However,
for many it is the images from the Balkans – Stoddart spent four years 
there during the conflict and was badly injured when caught in the 
fighting – that have resonated with visitors.

One
graphic picture that stays with many is of a mother, her face stained 
with tears as, desperate that her child should escape Sarajevo, she 
reaches up to give her little boy to a stranger on a bus allowed through
the front lines. She doesn’t know whether she will ever see the boy 
again and it is a heartbreaking moment of uncertainty with which any 
parent could identify.

In fact, the story had a happy ending as both survived and now live in Australia.
