Accident victim Emma Stephens

One lazy Sunday morning back in July, Emma Stephens slipped while climbing out of the bath - landing teeth-first on the bath rim.

'I didn't have time to put a hand in front of my face,' she recalls. The fall smashed one of Emma's bottom teeth into pieces, while a top tooth came out completely. Three teeth next to it ended up embedded high in her gums.

Emma, 44, her partner Karl and her two children, aged 11 and seven, were staying at her mother's house in Hertfordshire. Hearing the crash, Karl raced upstairs and hauled her out of the bath.

'It wasn't until I saw his face that I realised it was serious. My mouth was full of blood - I couldn't string a sentence together,' recalls Emma, who works for a telecommunications group. 'I was in such a state of shock that I didn't really feel the pain. But it was still terrifying.'

Things would only get worse - the ambulance took 40 minutes to arrive, and was turned away from the local A&E. 'The doctors said we needed to go a hospital with a specialist clinic,' she says.

Although there are no official figures on how many people damage their teeth in accidents or assaults in the UK, it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of people each year have their teeth chipped, broken or pushed out of place.

A recent audit based on 1,384 patients has revealed there is woeful confusion nationwide over what to do when someone loses a tooth - with nothing like the strict protocols that exist for treating other medical emergencies, such as broken bones.

This lack of clarity - as well as little specialist training for dentists - is leaving patients in pain and with disfiguring injuries, says Serpil Djemal, a consultant in restorative dentistry, who established the UK's only adult- dedicated dental trauma unit, at King's College Hospital, London.

According to the new evidence, which was collected by Miss Djemal, half of patients who experience some sort of dental trauma remain in severe pain and suffer disabling stress and embarrassment for weeks afterwards.

Yet there are very simple measures we could all take that could dramatically reduce the impact of someone losing a tooth. The first of these, says Miss Djemal, is never to discard a tooth that's been knocked out.

'Pick it up - avoiding the root - get rid of any obvious dirt by licking it or running it under water, then put it back in the mouth as close as possible to where it belongs,' she advises.

'Minutes count here. When a tooth is knocked out, the nerves and blood vessels are severed; the blood supply to the live tooth is cut. But delicate cells on the surface of the root of the tooth are capable of re-attaching themselves to the jawbone - as long as they're not damaged.'

If putting the tooth back within minutes of the accident is out of the question, putting it in milk will maintain the correct fluid balance in the root, and will help the cells to survive for longer - possibly up to six hours. 

'A knocked-out permanent tooth is one of the few real emergency situations in dentistry,' says Dr Peter Day, consultant in paediatric dentistry at Leeds University. 'The public needs to be made aware of how to proceed immediately following these unexpected injuries.'

Next week, Miss Djemal will launch a charity called Dental Trauma UK, which aims to ensure everyone knows what to do if they lose a tooth. Its slogan is: 'Pick it, Lick it and Stick it.'

'Putting a tooth back in the gum could save the tooth,' she says. 'If bystanders, paramedics and doctors at A&E all know how important this is, it could mean that far more teeth are saved.'

The charity will also begin a major educational programme for dentists - with extra training, online material and an accreditation programme, so people can check that their local dentist has the expertise to treat dental trauma. 'The urgent care patients need can only be provided by local dentists,' says Miss Djemal.

'While all undergraduate dentists learn about reimplantation and managing dental trauma, they'll get no more than a single lecture on the subject. The vast majority will never see a case involving a knocked-out tooth during their training.'

Indeed, research led by Dr Day has shown that out of 200 children treated at five dental clinics after a tooth had been knocked out, only 25 were re-implanted.

'Children are advised not to have implants until their jaw is fully formed, which normally happens by age 18. Without a tooth or implant in place, the bone in the jaw begins to deteriorate - with a permanent impact on their dental health,' he adds.

Emma was lucky. Her partner Karl knew from his rugby-playing days that a knocked-out tooth was worth saving.

Emma says: 'I saw it in the bath and was going to throw it away. But Karl took it downstairs and put it in a glass of milk, which he brought along to the hospital.

'I was still too shocked to ask what on earth he was doing.'

After being turned away by A&E, Karl drove Emma to the maxillofacial clinic at Northwick Park Hospital, 20 miles away, where doctors put the tooth back in her mouth - fixing it in place with a splint. 'I never for a moment thought the tooth would re-root. But it did. If Karl had not been so quick-thinking, I'd have had to live with a missing tooth or spend £2,000 on an implant.'

The expense of dental work isn't the only consideration.

'Once a real tooth takes root, it has the same chance of surviving for longer than an implant,' says Miss Djemal.

She also advises patients to keep a decent photograph of their smile. 'A selfie will do perfectly,' she says. This is so knocked-out teeth can be reimplanted in the right position.

'An X-ray can provide this information - but only if the tooth is still straight and the damage is relatively minor,' she explains.

Emma was referred to the dental trauma service at King's College Hospital 24 hours after her accident - and was surprised to be asked if she had a selfie.

'Karl had a picture of me on his phone, with my face full-on and with a big smile.'

It provided all the information the dentists needed.

That day, Emma had five hours of reconstructive surgery. The knocked-out tooth was repositioned, the teeth that had been pushed into the gums were pulled back in place and the smashed bottom tooth was replaced with a tooth-coloured filling built up over the original root.

Since then, Emma has had regular root-canal work to repair some damaged nerves.

However, not all patients receive treatment so quickly. When Carlota Berruezo, 33, fractured two top teeth and pushed a third into her lower gum after going over the handlebars of her bike this summer, it took nearly a fortnight to get the emergency treatment she needed.

Carlota, a strategic consultant who lives in South-West London, was told by her local A&E that as her jaw was not broken, she should see an emergency dentist.

But after five different consultations over 12 days, Carlota was still in agony - with one tooth stuck in her gum - and unable to close her mouth.

'I spent £1,000 on various investigations and X-rays, as well as having one piece of broken tooth taken out and the nerve underneath it removed,' she says.

She was incorrectly told the only way to get the stuck tooth back in place was by wearing a fixed brace for a year - at a cost of £18,000.

Finally, one dentist told her about the King's College clinic, where the stuck tooth was manoeuvred back into position at the first appointment.

'In the last four months, I've had the other teeth restored, and root-canal work to repair the nerves. I'm pretty well back to normal.'

Emma's teeth have also been fully repaired. 'For several weeks, I was living on shakes and soft food because the teeth felt insecure, even though they were all held in place. I lost a stone.'

Now, she feels lucky to have landed on her teeth. 'Anywhere else on my head and I might not have been here,' she says.'
