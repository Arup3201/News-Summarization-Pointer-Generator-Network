The sound of fireworks exploding could be heard around the neighbourhood in the city of Makhachkala, in Russia’s south-western Republic of Dagestan, while debris was sent flying into the sky. 

Footage of the dramatic blast was taken by Natella Ankudinova, 38.

She uploaded the video onto VKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook.

She said: 'I live opposite the petrol station in a high-rise block of flats and always appreciated the view but never realised that I would get a first-hand view of something so dramatic.

'It was actually a bit too close for comfort but there were no consequences for my home.'  

Police confirmed four people had been hospitalised with severe burns as a result of the fire. 

An investigation has been launched to discover the cause of the blast.

Several cars were also destroyed in the flames.
