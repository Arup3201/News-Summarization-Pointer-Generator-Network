Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has got mud all over his face - as he posted a photo on Twitter standing outside a health spa with a face mask on.

The forward was in a dressing gown with his arms aloft as he enjoys his time off following a dismal World Cup for Portugal.

He posted a picture of himself and his girlfriend Irina Shayk about to board a helicopter earlier in the week as he relaxes on holiday.

The former Manchester United ace is currently relaxing on holiday with Russian beauty Shayk ahead of the new season.

Last season's La Liga top goal scorer has been afforded some extra time off before he starts pre-season training with Spanish giants Real Madrid due to Portugal's early elimination from the World Cup.

The 29-year-old was pictured leaving Greek island Mykonos with several members of his family early last week.
