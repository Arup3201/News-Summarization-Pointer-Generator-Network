It's arguable that the Capital One Cup is the premier domestic competition in terms of throwing up stories. MK Dons thrashing Manchester United, Bradford beating Arsenal and Northampton winning at Anfield on penalties all spring to mind without digging too deeply. 

That tradition of shocks is almost certain to form part of Micky Mellon's team talk when Shrewsbury Town entertain the might of Chelsea next month. Shrewsbury’s annual wage bill is understood to be about £1.4million, more than 125 times smaller than their visitors' – which stands at £176m. 

Eden Hazard’s new £200,000-a-week contract would see him earn more in two months than the entire squad in Shropshire.

The League Two side have earned their night. Shipwrecked Blackpool were dispatched easily back in August before top flight Leicester City couldn't find a way past their lowly visitors in round two. 

In fact, that is something all three higher ranked sides - Tuesday's scalp Norwich City included - failed to do: score against the Shrews. 

Jose Mourinho would do well not to take their trip to New Meadow lightly. This is a club on the rise, well set up by Mellon and steely at the back. 

If they were to pull something else off, it would be comparable to that freezing December night at Valley Parade two years ago, the shootout at Anfield and even more impressive than United's mauling in Milton Keynes a month ago. 

Mellon was brought in over the summer as Town revamped themselves into a club able to bounce straight back into the third tier following relegation. 

They've done it very cheaply, too. 

Top goalscorer James Collins was brought back from Hibernian for a nominal fee in the summer  while Andy Mangan, his partner, cost nothing. Not a bean.

The same can be said for Jayson Leutwiler, James Wesolowski, Mickey Demetriou, Cameron Gayle, John-Louis Akpa Akpro, Nat Knight-Percival and Scott Vernon. The list goes on. Seventeen (17) new players. 

Cesc Fabregas (celebrating at Manchester City on Sunday) cost Chelsea £30million from Barcelona

Diego Costa (scoring against Swansea City earlier this month) was a £32million capture from Atletico Madrid

Compare that then to Chelsea. £32million on Diego Costa. £30million on Cesc Fabregas. A fair wedge on substitute Loic Remy, too. 

The total amount splurged by the London club stood at £92.5million.  

The tie will not be as lucrative as might be thought, there is no prize money, but a £125,000 cheque for what should be a live television game will be gratefully received by a club who lost their League One status last season.

‘Hopefully we can give a good account of ourselves on and off the field and people will come back and see us more often,’ chief executive Matt Williams told Sportsmail. ‘With my business head on I’d have preferred to be away at Stamford Bridge with 40,000 people. But from the point of view of the chairman, supporters and players we’re absolutely delighted it’s at Greenhous Meadow.’ 

Almost 10,000 supporters will be crammed into Shrewsbury's small New Meadow ground 

These sides are worlds apart, and the competition pits them level. It does not matter that the Blues have lifted the trophy four times before or that Shrewsbury's greatest achievement was reaching the semi-final in 1961. 

They've never played in the first division and the only silverware won comes from topping the third tier (1979) and fourth (1994). There isn't even a Johnstone's Paint trophy in the cabinet. 

A trip to League Two opposition for Chelsea may provoke thoughts of agricultural football and a pitch to match – but Shrewsbury provide pristine conditions and a positive style of play.

‘The stadium is immaculate, like the day we moved in,’ said Williams. ‘It doesn’t matter Chelsea are coming to town, it could be Accrington, no disrespect, but we want to do it right off the field.

‘On the field we like to get it down and play. We know we’re a country mile away from Chelsea in terms of the ability they have but our lads will relish it. Some of our lads have the ability to play in the Premier League or Championship.

‘We want to give a good account of ourselves. We don’t want it be a cricket score. We want people to see what we do and come back.

‘We are heading in the right direction after last year’s disappointment. Our manager is very proactive. There are one or two of us who call him Micky Mourinho.

‘He is a great manager with a great future in the game. His attention to detail and organisation is among the best I’ve ever worked with.

‘I’m sure the club will make sure there is a nice glass of red wine in his office for Jose after the game.’

This will be their night, with almost 10,000 crammed in baying for another upset. Mourinho should take a strong enough outfit not to become another name etched on League Cup's growing list of casualties.
