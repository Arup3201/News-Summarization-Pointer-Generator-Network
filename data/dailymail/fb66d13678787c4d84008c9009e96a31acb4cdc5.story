Cheerleader: Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said public opposition to GM foods had softened

Consumers no longer care about the issue of GM crops, the Environment Secretary claims.

Owen Paterson insisted genetically modified products should be cultivated and manufactured in Britain and said they would cut costs for hard-pressed shoppers.

Mr Paterson, a Government cheerleader for the technology, which Britain has resisted, said consumers had accepted a move to allow shops to sell meat from animals raised on GM feed, suggesting public opposition had softened.

He added: ‘It is impossible to detect. If an animal, a chicken or a pig, has eaten GM material, you can’t tell. The fact that the public didn’t react to that was very interesting.’

His latest intervention prompted an 
angry response from anti-GM campaigners, who accused him of 
misrepresenting the evidence and taking voters’ views for granted.

Mr
Paterson, in an interview for political magazine, The House, said 
consumers had happily accepted a move to allow meat from animals fed on 
GM animal feed, suggesting controversy had dimmed.

‘I thought it was 
very interesting when some of the main retailers [Tesco and others] felt
that they could no longer tell their consumers that they were selling 
meat products which had not consumed GM material at some stage because 
nearly all our animal feed now has contained some GM.

‘Of course it 
is undetectable, it is impossible to detect. If an animal, a chicken or a
pig has eaten GM material, you can’t tell. I thought the fact that the 
public didn’t react to that was very interesting.’ The minister insisted
that GM had been grown across much of the rest of the world for many 
years and there were no reports of any adverse impact.

‘There are 17 
million farmers cultivating 170m hectares which is 12 per cent of the 
world’s arable land, which is seven times the surface area of the UK and
not a single person has come to me with a report of any health 
problem,’ he said.

‘The fact that every single member of the House of
Commons has been on holiday to America and has come back happily, 
healthy and sane shows that this is a technology which can feed the 
world. It’s not the only solution but it is a very valuable technology.’

The Environment Secretary, who is thought to want GM products 
widely available on supermarket shelves by the end of the decade, added:
‘It would be good to grow some GM crops in this country because some of
these products would be cheaper which helps our consumers, who are 
under a lot of pressure. We all know the cost of living and the cost of 
food has become an issue.’

He also claimed there were ‘massive 
environmental gains’. ‘There are huge reductions in spraying... there 
would be massive savings in pretty strong chemicals which we spray the 
whole time, huge savings in diesel, huge savings in compaction of soil, 
there’s no doubt about it. That’s a straight help to agriculture.’

Mr
Paterson also saidn ‘agritechnology’, which covers GM crops and 
conventional crop manipulation, represents a major business opportunity 
for Britain and was an industry in which the country should become a 
world leader.

‘We have top class research institutions... when I was 
in Germany I was talking to other companies and I would love them to 
come here.

'This doesn’t have to be GM. We are looking at a 
conventional wheat development which could increase the yield of wheat 
by 25 per cent, I would love that to be done here.

Criticism: Opponents of Mr Paterson said adopting GM food could harm Britain's reputation

‘I would like the 
UK to become the leading nation in Europe for agritechnology. I would 
really like to go a whole step further.’

Mr Paterson insisted that 
products were being cleared by watchdogs for human consumption, but then
blocked across Europe because of political resistance.

‘Time and 
again, products pass through the very rigorous scientific process and 
then get stuck at the political level. So we are talking at member state
level to other member states to see if we can get this moving. Because 
at the moment Europe is going to fall further and further behind,’ he 
said.

Mr Paterson caused controversy earlier this month when he said 
millions of children in the developing world are ‘dying or going blind’ 
because GM crops, some of which are desgined to boost vitamin content, 
have not been more widely adopted.

Dr Helen Wallace, of GeneWatch, 
which campaigns to ensure any use of GM is in the public interest, said:
‘There would be a massive disadvantage to Britain’s reputation for good
farming if we grew GM crops in Britain.

‘The evidence shows that GM 
crops which are resistant to weedkillers actually increase the amount of
spraying which harms wildlife. Polls show that the public wants meat, 
milk and dairy products fed on GM animal feed to be labelled. Then we 
would have a better gauge of whether people actually want to buy it.

‘I
think Owen Paterson will be surprised by the reaction if he tries to 
have GM crops grown in this country. There are still very many people 
who are strongly opposed to this technology, and growing them here would
cause a big backlash.’

Due to the controversy when GM technology 
was first adopted in the 1990s, there are only a handful of products 
containing GM crops currently available on British high streets.

Currently, there are no commercial GM crops in Britain, but livestock is commonly reared on imported GM feed.

But
the Prime Minister, the Government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Mark
Walport, and Science Minister David Willetts have all voiced support 
for GM. The scientific community also overwhelmingly supports its wider 
use, with experts insisting each product must be judged on its merits 
rather than damning a whole technology.
