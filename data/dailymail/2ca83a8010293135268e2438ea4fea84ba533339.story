It sounds like a plot straight out of Hollywood.

But the reality was a lot grimmer for two teenage boys who faked an arrest in Port St Lucie, Florida, as a cover for allegedly stealing $20 of Yu-Gi-Oh!-themed game cards.

According to a police report, Brandon 
Rhoads, 17, posed as a plain clothed policeman and strolled into a 
Walmart store with a gun in a holster, flashing a wallet with a badge to
store manager Laura Dougherty, 52.

The teenager then 'arrested' his underage friend, 14, before marching him out of the store with the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.

However, the pair caught the eagle eye of Dougherty, who followed them out of Walmart and watched Rhoads unlock a set of toy handcuffs from his friend's wrists.

The duo bolted when they realised Dougherty was following them.

nabbed the two teenagers as they ran across a car park. Rhoads was 
carrying a black wallet containing a badge and silver toy handcuffs. 
Officers also found a pellet gun that Rhoads had thrown into bushes.

Rhoads
was charged with impersonating a police officer, a felony and resisting
an officer. His friend was charged with theft and resisting an officer.
