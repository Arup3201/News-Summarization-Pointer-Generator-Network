Rescued: Pocket with Karla Barricella before she headed off to live her new life

An emaciated, skeletal pitbull puppy dumped alongside her equally malnourished brother in a New Jersey park last month has found a new home this week after recovering.

Pocket and her brother Bugsy were found by a jogger in Paterson having been dumped, near death on a baseball park.

When animal control officers arrived to take the dogs away they found six month old Pocket standing over her brother protecting him and trying to comfort her struggling sibling. Sadly Bugsy died a day later at Paterson Animal Control.

The puppies both weighed 14 pounds instead of a healthy 50 and the veterinarian who examined them said they had noth been subjected to an 'extreme, extreme case of neglect.'

Despite the death of her sibling, Pocket returned to health and gained 11 pounds in two weeks and has been sent to a new home weighing more than 25 pounds.

Karla Barricella of Bergen County adopted Pocket after reading about her case in a newspaper.

Her last dog, a rottweiler, died two years ago and Karla told NBC New York that she is now ready to be a dog owner again.

'My heart opened up again,' said Barricella to NBC New York.

'The love -- you can just feel it. She is the sweetest, dearest animal ... and I will give her the warmest, dearest home in the world.'

Karla's son, James, said that his mother is sure to spoil Pocket.

'Her dogs get more presents at Christmas than we did as kids because she takes good care of them,' said James Barricella to NBC New York.

Meanwhile, authorities have said they are still searching for the suspects who abused and abandoned Pocket and Bugsy.

A $1,000 reward is being offered for information.

'There's no such thing as bad animals in the world. There's bad people that allow it to happen,' John DeCando of Paterson Animal Control said when the pups were found. 'This has got to stop.'
