Despite experiencing a 'baptism of fire' in charge of Tottenham, Tim Sherwood says he only has his mind on managing again after this season.

The 38-year-old will leave the club at the end of the season having failed to impress Daniel Levy after Andre Villas Boas' sacking in December.

And Sherwood admits he 'couldn't do without' management, playing down reports of a future as an assistant.

'I have,' said Sherwood after being asked whether he had enjoyed his time at the club. 'It's been an honour to manage this great football club.It's been different, it's an an experience like no other.'

'Unless you've ever stood in that technical area and had the expectation of the whole football club then you don't really know what it's like to be a manager.

'I've enjoyed it and perversely I've enjoyed the pressure. I'm not sure I could do without it now.'

As well as denying he had talks over a No 2 role, he also rejected claims he would be interested in the Norwich job, calling it disrespectful.

Tottenham travel to play West Brom this weekend, and despite the hosts needing points to secure their Premier League survival, Sherwood insists the match is just as important for his side.

'Any other club's need can't be greater than ours. We need to win. We've got five Cup finals left and I think we can take maximum points from those games.'

One worry for Tottenham, and possibly England, is the fitness of Kyle Walker.

The right-back has been out of action in recent weeks with a pelvic problem, and his manager says that although the injury is worrying, he is sure he will still make the plane to Brazil to play in the World Cup this summer.

'We're concerned immediately because he's not fit and it would be very doubtful if he were fit for next week.

'He's still got  a lot of time before the World Cup and Kyle is one of the best right backs - I'm sure he'll be on the plane even if he doesn't make an appearance for Tottenham before the end of the season.'

Louis Van Gaal is the favourite to be made the next permanent manager at White Hart Lane, but Sherwood has been consistent in refusing to talk about the future of the club.

'It's just about me concentrating on the game and today I'm concentrating on the game tomorrow. I think those questions are not for me to answer. Its just for me to worry about football matches and hopefully trying to win the next five games for Tottenham.

'That will iron itself out in due course. For me to worry about preparing the team, like I've done this week. We had a good week's training and we're really going to West Brom on the front foot and trying to entertain those great Tottenham fans and get three points.

'The speculation has never eased since I came in. I've always fended off the questions. I don't see a difference from the first hour to now.'
