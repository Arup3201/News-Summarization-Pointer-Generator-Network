A Colorado couple whose wedding comes just a year after the murder-suicide of the groom's parents is inviting the whole community of 12,000 to their joyous event in the hope of creating happy new memories for themselves and the town.

Teneil Jayne is marrying Keith Appel, whose mother Chris Appel was found shot dead by his father Larry Appel on July 11 last year. Larry Appel's body was found in the living room with a gunshot wound to the head and a .22 caliber handgun by his side.

The wedding is to be held at Steamboat Springs High School's football field at 11:30am this Saturday, the same place a memorial service was held for Appel's parents last year.

New start: Keith Appel and Teneil Jayne, pictured here with two of Appel's children, have invited the town of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, to attend their wedding at a local high school football field this Saturday

'I'd love to see the whole town there,' Teneil Jayne toldÂ Steamboat Today.

The wedding is a bright spot at the end of a difficult year for the family.

Come one, come all: The wedding invite for Keith Appel and Teneil Jayne's nuptials on Saturday doesn't require any RSVP, but the couple expect a huge turnout for the event

Keith Appel believes financial distress 
was at the root of his parents' problems, culminating in the horrific 
events of July 11 2012.

'They were the greatest people in the world, and financial times just ate them up,' Appel told Steamboat Today.

Happy together: Jayne and Appel are hoping their wedding can create happy memories that outweigh the painful ones of the past

They'd initially planned a small beach wedding, but Appel and Teneil Jayne say that the community was so supportive of them after the tragedy they wanted all of their friends and neighbors to be there on their big day.

'We really feel like a good, strong 
marriage is well-rooted in the community, and we have a lot of friends 
and family in the community,' said Jayne.

After the ceremony, there will be a reception at the Rusted Porch Restaurant, where guests can buy lunch and dessert for $5.

'Even if you don't know us, it's still a celebration with a cheap lunch,' said Jayne.
