Huge differences in the face-to-face teaching time students receive at Britain's top universities have been exposed by new official figures.

Some undergraduates – paying tuition fees of £9,000 a year – get fewer than half the hours of lectures, seminars and tutorials than others studying the same subject at another university.   

Critics say the disparities mean many are getting a 'very raw deal' and accuse some universities of  failing to offer value for money.

The new figures, compiled from statistics on Government website Unistats, show that one of the widest gaps involves undergraduates studying history at York University, who spend just eight per cent of their course in lectures and seminars, with the rest in 'independent' study.

This is fewer than 100 hours a year 'contact' time with academics and works out at a cost of nearly £100 an hour.

But if they are reading the same subject at University College London, they will receive more than  triple the face-to-face teaching hours, at a rate of about £28 an hour.

In other examples, politics students at Leeds University and theology students at Sheffield spend ten per cent of their time in face-to-face teaching – about 120 hours of  lectures and tutorials a year – while their counterparts at Liverpool and Manchester enjoy double that.

At some newer universities, where the ability of the intake is more mixed and teaching takes priority over research, contact time tends to be greater.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: 'Some students are getting a very raw deal.

The temptation of these universities 
is to free-up staff to concentrate on their own research, which tends to
 be more lucrative than teaching.'

Anthony
 Seldon, the master of leading independent school Wellington College, 
Berkshire, said: 'The majority of students have a tremendous time at 
university and are appreciative of that.

'But increasingly we hear of 
disappointment in the low level of demand placed on them and the lack of
 quality time with academics and personal attention.'

One
 history student in his second year at York said: 'We all left school at
 the same level but friends at Oxbridge and other universities are 
working much more intensively than us – but we pay the same fees.'

The
 lack of face-to-face teaching on some courses has been one of the 
biggest causes of complaints by  students.

'However, official figures 
have become available only in recent months on the website after 
Ministers insisted families had the right to make comparisons before 
choosing a course.

York 
University's history department said it offered one-to-one  drop-in 
sessions and dissertation supervision with academics that was not 
reflected in the statistics.

Leeds
 said its courses 'deliberately involve independent study alongside 
teaching from some of the most respected academics in the world' to 
allow students to 'think critically'.
