There are a number of hand gestures used around the world that people recognise, regardless of what country or language they're being used in - such as tapping your wrist to ask for the time, or writing in mid-air when asking for the bill.

However, the rise in technology is seeing an number of new, tech-related gestures achieving similar global recognition, according to research from HP.

For example, the European study found  89 per cent of people can correctly identify the finger swiping motion for 'the next page' - and this exceeded the 83 per cent of people who identified the gesture for asking for a drink.

Tech firm HP asked 6,000 people across UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Russia to identify nine hand actions. They included traditional, everyday gestures such as OK, established tech gestures, including 'texting', and more contemporary gestures, such as 'next page' and 'scroll down' pictured

HP surveyed 6,000 people across the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Russia, and asked each participant to identify nine different actions.

The first three were traditional, everyday gestures including the OK sign, made by pressing together a thumb and index finger, raising an imaginary glass to ask someone for a drink, and tapping a wrist to ask for the time.

The next three were established technology gestures including holding an imaginary telephone to the ear to signify ‘call me’, tapping a thumb rapidly to mimic texting, and typing on an imaginary keyboard when discussing emails.

Respondents were then asked to identify three actions based on modern touchscreen hand gestures, namely swiping to the next page, scrolling, and zooming out.

The vast majority of people in the UK correctly identified gestures for calling someone and typing an email (97 per cent and 88 per cent respectively), while 81 per cent also correctly identified the ‘scroll down’ gesture.

James Morrish, HP's chief technologist for printing and personal systems in UK and Ireland said: 'This study shows how new technology is paving the way for new immersive ways of interacting with our devices.

As expected, established gestures such as 'What's the time?' had one of the highest recognition rates, pictured bottom. The sign for OK was recognised in 86% of cases, but people in France and Russia also thought it was the sign for zero

There were cultural variations in the understanding of 'zoom out', pictured. In the UK, recognition rate dropped to 18% while France (37%) Spain (18%) and Russia (30%) also found the 'zoom out' gesture harder to identify. Respondents from Italy and Germany fared better, with 95% and 89% respectively

'We used to learn to ‘speak’ our computer’s language, but today gesture-led technology intuitively works in conjunction with our natural language and movements.'

There were some cultural variations in the understanding of the ‘zoom 
out’ gesture, however.

In the UK, the recognition rate dropped to 18 per cent, while France (37 per cent) Spain (18 per cent) and Russia 
(30 per cent) also found the ‘zoom out’ gesture slightly harder to 
identify.

In addition, just under a third (30 per cent) of the UK sample
 said that they didn’t know the meaning of the ‘zoom out’ gesture.

Respondents from Italy and Germany fared far better, with 95 per cent and 89 per cent getting it right respectively. 

When it comes to drinking, Germans and Britons most commonly mimed a large glass when asking for a drink. In France, the most common drinking gesture was the 'wine bottle' mime. Italians used a mixture of large glasses and wine bottles, while Russians additionally used a short glass gesture, pictured

Gestural communication expert Dr. Peter Collett said: 'The findings suggest some gestures can give 
rise to ‘iconic confusion’.

In the case of the zoom out command, for 
example, the fingers actually come closer together, not further apart, 
which looks like they’re depicting a narrower, not a wider, perspective.

'It’s quite likely that the inherent contradiction of this gesture will 
slow down its spread, even in countries where touch screens are widely 
used, until such time as the gesture manages to gain a proper foothold'.

The study also found age does not significantly impact a person's ability to recognise new tech gestures with only a two per cent difference in success rate between the over 65 age group, and participants aged 18 to 24.

'This is a story about the constant evolution of humanity and what we are seeing is a snapshot of a deeply fascinating process, as it happens,' added Dr. Collett.

'The younger generation has an inherent understanding of touch technology, and their influence extends to people who are much older. In no time at all ‘touch tech’ gestures will become a part of a universal convention.'
