A woman accused of faking cancer is standing trial for falsely claiming she was raped by two men. 

Sara Ylen, 38, of Lexington, Michigan, has admitted using make-up to make it look like she had been attacked. 

James Johnson, a retired detective sergeant for the Sanilac County Sheriff Department, gave evidence yesterday at St Clair County Court, in Michigan, and said he had never heard a victim provide so much detail when he interviewed her after the alleged assault.

According to Johnson, he interviewed her on September 26, 2012, but wasn't able to find records of her attending Port Huron Hospital after the alleged attack which he said 'troubled' him. 

He later met with Sanilac County Medical Examiner William Starbird and discovered her bruising had been wiped off.

James Grissom, who spent 10 years in jail after being convicted of raping Ylen in 2003, was also present in court yesterday. 

Grissom was released in November 2012 after new evidence showed Ylen had made other accusations of rape.

Michigan Supreme Court subsequently granted Grissom a new trial.

According to The Times Herald, he said: 'It's strange. Last time I was coming down to this courtroom I had handcuffs on'.

St Clair County prosecutor Mike Wendling has requested that the case is dropped due to the length of time between the alleged attack and the discovery of new evidence.

Wendling has also asked that the case is reassigned because his office's link with Ylen during the Grissom case.

Ylen is charged with filing a false report of rape and tampering with evidence. 

She asked for her anonymity to be lifted when she told her story in a newspaper. 

She also faces fraud charges in Sanilac County following an investigation by Michigan State Police who investigated Ylen's cancer claims in May 2012 and discovered none of the doctors she listed had diagnosed her with cancer.

Her trial related to fake cancer claims begins on February 4. 

The trial related to false rape claims continues today.
