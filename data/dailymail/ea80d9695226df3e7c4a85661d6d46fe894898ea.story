She's tipped to play Anastasia Steele in the upcoming film adaptation of EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey, and has even admitted she'd be excited to take on the role.

And to give us a sneak peek of how she might look in the on-screen trilogy, British actress Felicity Jones, 29, has undergone a dramatic, wintry make-over.

The petite star of Like Crazy and Chalet Girl - who is also the face of Dolce & Gabbana make-up - took part in a photo shoot for InStyle magazine with make-up artist Dele Olo.

Admitting that she's 'always loved Sixties French films and Brigitte Bardot', the tiny Londoner channeled the Gallic beauty with ethereal make-up accentuating her enormous green eyes and bee-sting lips.

Jones, who lives in east London with her artist boyfriend Ed Fornieles, began acting as a child with a starring role in the TV adaptation of Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch.

She went on to play Emma Carter in The Archers on Radio Four's, while also finding time to complete a degree in English at Oxford University.

Talking about her make-up routine, the actress - who says her favourite look is 'a strong eye and nude glossy lip' - explained: 'I use SPF every day, then apply foundation, mascara, eyeliner and blusher. I always take my make-up off at night and moisturise.'

Speaking about her love of D&G, she said: 'I was always really passionate about their designs, so it was exciting when they asked me.

'There’s such a sense of theatre in getting glammed up; it’s like putting on a play or short film. And I love the make-up from this current collection.'

LUXE LASHES

'Lashes are a fun way to play with texture, 
whether you go for natural, coloured or dramatic ones. Before you apply them, dust a soft wash of 
shimmery peach eyeshadow [Olo used Dolce & Gabbana The Make Up's 
Animalier Collection] over the lid and do the same once the glue has 
dried to create a seamless finish. For the lips, mix balm and gloss for 
hydration and subtle shine.'

Tip: if you don’t like wearing falsies, load up on at least four coats of mascara.  

BOLD BROWS

'Big,
defined brows really complement these looks. They perfectly 
frame the fluttery lashes and give the metallic textures and dewy skin 
more of an edge. Once you’ve applied your foundation, take a clean 
cotton bud over your brows to remove any residue. Next, brush up your 
brows to help locate any sparse areas, then take an eyebrow pencil in 
the same colour as your brows to fill in any gaps.'

Tip: Use soft, 
feathery strokes and a clear setting gel to keep your brows in place.  

PLATINUM EYES

'A
strong eye and nude lip is very Sixties, but this has a modern feel 
thanks to the textures. Blend a powder eyeshadow over the entire lid, 
take the colour up over the crease, out into a wing shape, then down 
along the lower lash line. You can enhance the colour by applying cream 
eyeshadow over the top. For the lips, use a creamy nude lipstick, then 
add lots of clear gloss.

Tip: 'Match your manicure to your pout with high-shine nude nails,' says shoot manicurist Kim Treacy. 

SHEENY SKIN

'This
look is so pretty and fresh for this time of year, as it prevents 
winter skin looking dull and flat. It isn't about creating a tan, it's 
about adding shimmer and iridescence. Begin with liquid foundation – 
warm it up on the back of your hand first, so it melts into your 
complexion and creates an almost second skin. Next, you want to 
highlight and accentuate your features, so apply a pearlescent cream or 
powder over your cheekbones. Finish the look with mascara 
and a strong, dark eye.'

Tip: Only use blotting powders if essential – 
you need that extra sheen in the winter.
