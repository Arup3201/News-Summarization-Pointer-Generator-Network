Iranian experts are planning to 'reverse engineer' the U.S. drone captured by its armed forces in a bid to recover data and mass-produce a superior version of the aircraft.

Tehran has been flaunting the capture of the downed U.S. drone which 'violated Iran airspace', with experts saying the drone could now be reproduced through reverse engineering.

Gen Hossein Salami, deputy head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard, said on state television that the violation of Iran's airspace by the U.S. drone was a 'hostile act' and warned of a 'bigger' response.

Officials in Iran even believe they can 'mass produce' the captured bat-winged stealthy RQ-170 Sentinel and build a 'superior' version following its crash on December 4.

Parviz Sorouri, the head of Iran's parliamentary national security committee, said today: 'Our next action will be to reverse-engineer the aircraft.

'In the near future, we will be able to mass produce it ... Iranian engineers will soon build an aircraft superior to the American [drone] using reverse engineering.'

Iranian officials say a Revolutionary Guards cyber-warfare unit hacked the aircraft's flight controls.

Sorouri said Iran experts were in the 'final stages of cracking (the drone's) code'.

He also denied accusations from the U.S. that Iran didn't have the technology to replicate the drone, and that it would only be able to do so with Russian of Chinese help.

He added: 'we will not need Russian or Chinese cooperation' to copy the drone.

'They will definitely not be involved. This great defensive capability is reserved for us, and we are not ready to share it with others.

'We will use this capability as a deterrence. And I doubt the Islamic republic would share this technology with other countries.'

last Thursday of Iranian military officials inspecting what it 
identified as the RQ-170 Sentinel drone.

Gen
Salami called its capture a victory for Iran and a defeat for the U.S. 
in a complicated intelligence and technological battle.

'Iran is among the few countries that possesses the most modern technology in the field of pilotless drones. The technology gap between Iran and the US is not much,' he said.

Broke down: US officials say Iran had nothing to do with the drone crashing to earth. They contend it simply malfunctioned

Officers in the Guard, Iran's most powerful military force, had previously claimed that the country's armed forces brought down the surveillance aircraft with an electronic ambush, causing minimum damage to the drone.

American officials have said that US intelligence assessments indicate that Iran neither shot the drone down, nor used electronic or cybertechnology to force it from the sky.

They contend the drone malfunctioned. The officials had spoken anonymously in order to discuss the classified program.

But Gen Salami refused to provide more details of Iran's claim to have captured the CIA-operated aircraft.

'A party that wins in an intelligence battle doesn't reveal its methods. We can't elaborate on the methods we employed to intercept, control, discover and bring down the pilotless plane,' he said.

Â  The European Union 'definitely' will not impose sanctions on OPEC member Iran's oil exports because such a measure would harm the global crude market, Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi said on Sunday.

EU leaders called on Friday for more sanctions against Iran by the end of January, in an effort to increase pressure on Tehran over its disputed nuclear program.

'Our policy is sustainable supply of oil to Europe... Iran is a major oil producer and any sanctions on our oil export would harm the global market,' Qasemi told a news conference.

Last week, EU foreign ministers agreed to develop new sanctions on Iran's energy, transport and banking sectors.
