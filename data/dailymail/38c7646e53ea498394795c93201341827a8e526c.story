Ricky Walden continued his love affair with China as he won the International Championship in Chengdu, beating Mark Allen 10-7 in the final.

It was the Chester player's third ranking title, all in China after winning the 2008 Shanghai Masters and 2012 Wuxi Classic.

It capped a fine week for Walden, who hammered Robert Milkins 9-2 in his semi-final after previous wins over Lyu Chenwei, David Morris, Zhou Yuelong and giant-killers Joe Swail and Jamie Burnett, who had beaten Neil Robertson and Judd Trump respectively.

Ricky Walden claimed the International Championship in Chengdu after storming to the final 

Breaks of 59 and 64 helped him into a 3-1 lead at the interval in the first session but Allen levelled after a 113 break in frame six.

The next four were shared, Allen with a 52 in frame nine, and though Walden moved two clear with the help of an 85 break in frame 12 Allen responded with 68 and 74 to leave the match poised at 7-7.

The Englishman found another gear, though, with an 85 in frame 15 followed by a 103 to move within one frame of victory.

And he clinched the frame in two visits, a 54 putting him on top before a 62 saw him capture the £125,000 first prize. Runner-up Allen collected £65,000 towards his world ranking.

Walden said: 'I couldn't be happier. It was a tough first session today, and then I got better in the second session.

'It's a dream come true to win this event. All three of my titles have come in China and I love playing here.'

He told worldsnooker.com: 'I've not thought about the money. It was just so important for me to get my hands on the trophy. The money is just a bonus. My wife will find a good place for it.'

For Allen, who overcame Mark Williams 9-8 in a thrilling semi-final, it was a third defeat in four ranking finals this season. He won the Paul Hunter Classic in Furth but was beaten at the Riga Open and Shanghai Masters.

He said: 'I didn't come here to finish second. I'll probably look back in a few months' time and think I've had a great start to the season but I've lost three out of four finals and that's not good enough. It's something I have to work on.

'I need to go back to the practice table and keep working. I'm obviously doing the right things as I have got to four finals. I just need to turn them into victories.'
