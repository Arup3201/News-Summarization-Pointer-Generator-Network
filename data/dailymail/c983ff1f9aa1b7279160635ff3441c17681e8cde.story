to Utah Beach on Normandy's coastline

They proceeded to knock out German soldiers and cannons at Brecourt Manor that were firing on allied forces.

Mr Heffron was among 13 men who helped destroy an enemy battery and managed to obtain detailed maps for the German command post - a major coup for the allied forces.

killed 15 German soldiers and took 12 more as prisoners, helping to save
 countless American lives from the crushing cannon fire.
