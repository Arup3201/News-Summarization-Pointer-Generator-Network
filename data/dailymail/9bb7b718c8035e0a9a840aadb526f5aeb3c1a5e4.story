'I would order it': Speaking in Australia, Obama said he would send in the army if ISIS got nuclear arms

Barack Obama has said he would order the U.S. army into ISIS territory if they got a nuclear weapon.

The President and Commander-in-Chief was adamant that ground troops would be necessary if the United States were to discover the terror group had nuclear capabilities.

Obama conjured the nightmare scenario to illustrate that circumstances do exist in which  the United States military would enter a ground war with ISIS.

Previously the President - along with other military figures - has been keen to downplay the prospect of a 'boots on the ground' situation in Iraq of Syria.

But, speaking at a news conference in Australia today, the President insisted he would personally order the operation should the U.S. uncovering the terrifying intelligence.

He said: 'There are always circumstances in which the United States might need to deploy U.S. ground troops.

'If we discover that ISIL  had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands, then yes, you can anticipate that not only would Chairman Dempsey [the top U.S. general] recommend me sending U.S. ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands, but I would order it.'

ISIL (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) is the White House's preferred way of referring to ISIS. 

Around 1,500 U.S. troops are due to be deployed in Iraq already, but their duties are only to 'advise' Iraqi forces, and they are not expected to get involved in actual combat.

General Martin Dempsey said last week that military chiefs are 'considering' recommending that the President send combat troops in.

The President's words follow confirmation yesterday that ISIS killed another American hostage - Peter Kassig - in its latest propaganda video.

Responding to news of the former U.S. Army Ranger's death, Obama said he 'was taken from us in an act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity'.

He said the terror group, which calls itself the Islamic State, 'revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction.'
