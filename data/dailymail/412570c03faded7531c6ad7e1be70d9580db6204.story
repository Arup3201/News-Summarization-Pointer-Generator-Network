A woman was today caring for her baby born on the roof of a submerged medical centre amid the devastation of Typhoon Washi, which killed more than 1,000 in the Philippines last weekend.

Annaliza Tumanda gave birth to her daughter, Aizee, at the height of the storm and flash floods that destroyed their home in the southern region of Mindanao.

Today she was at a government run shelter, where aid workers are battling to head off a humanitarian disaster in the wake of the tempest.

'With God's will, we survived,' she told the Associated Press. 'It was like a miracle.'

Flash floods had forced Mrs Tumanda, her husband and their three children - aged between three and eight - to flee their home in the city of Cagayan do Oro late on Friday night.

In the lashing rain and fierce winds, the family swam through the floodwaters to a nearby three storey house, the strain and shock sending Mrs Tumanda into labour.

Rescuers from the Filipino police were able to reach them in the disaster zone on Saturday morning, and brought her through the devastation to the roof of a nearby medical centre.

On top of the submerged clinic, Mrs Tumanda gave birth to a healthy 6.6lb baby girl. She is now just another of the 640,000 who have had their lives ripped apart by the disaster, according to United Nations estimates.

In many ways, their battle has only just begun. A senior UN official today warned that outbreaks of disease could ravage survivors packed in their thousands in evacuation centres.

About 45,000 displaced are inside makeshift refugee camps, most of them in worst-hit Iligan and Cagayan de Oro cities in the southern Mindanao region.

Another 266,000 are being assisted outside the temporary shelters. Aid workers were rushing in relief supplies, but a lack of running water is a major concern.

Soe Nyunt-U, the UN's humanitarian coordinator on the scene, warned poor sanitation and hygiene in the shelters posed a grave risk of incubating a cholera-type virus.

Appealing for international aid, Mr Nyunt-U told reporters: 'We must improve this situation at the soonest possible time to avoid disease outbreaks that will further compound the hardships of the people already weakened by hunger and grief from loss of family and friends.'

Local authorities and grieving relatives are moving ahead with dozens of burials each day.

Local funeral parlors no longer accepting bodies, overwhelmed with the masses of dead still being retrieved from the sea or mud almost a week after the disaster.

The two cities struck by the tropical 
storm were home to nearly a million people and nearly 30,000 homes are 
thought to have been destroyed.

'It
was as if the cities were hit by an inland tsunami,' Mr Nyunt-U told 
reporters in Manila, the Filipino capital. 'Entire areas were completely
flattened.'

He added: 
'Debris from houses, buildings and other structures that had been 
destroyed by the storm was all swept out to the sea, leaving huge areas 
devoid of all traces of habitation.'

Mr Nyunt-U has appealed to the international community for $28million in aid for the region.

He said he was hopeful donors and foreign governments would respond to the appeal despite the global economic crisis.

An appeal launched following a 2009 typhoon that killed about 500 people in Manila collected only half the funds needed.

'It's the Christmas season and the willingness of the international community is high,' Mr Nyunt-U said. 'No country can stand alone.'
