Naomi Wilkinson, 50, a star of British theatre design, was found dead in her Islington home in November last year, eight months after her artist husband Paul Mason took his own life

A grief-stricken theatre designer killed herself because she felt unable to live without her husband who had committed suicide months earlier.

Days before her death, Naomi Wilkinson had sent a text message to her dead husband Charles Mason’s old phone, which read: ‘I don’t think I can do this any more.’

Miss Wilkinson, 50, who created sets for the English National Opera, was found dead beside photographs of her artist husband after inhaling toxic fumes.

St Pancras Coroner’s Court in London heard that the couple had been inseparable for 25 years but Mr Mason had committed suicide last March after a ‘depressive episode’. Miss Wilkinson was heartbroken by his death, and wrote letters and messages to him most days.

The court heard she was found in the basement of her Islington home on November 19 next to the photographs and a rose in a vase.

A note left for her family said: ‘Don’t feel sad, you have all done so, so much to help me, but I don’t want to live without Charles. I am so lucky to have had such a beautiful love xx.’

Her brother Anthony Wilkinson had gone round to check on his sister after she had stopped responding to his calls and messages.

He said his sister had been ‘devastated’ after her 50-year-old husband killed himself but had seemed to be improving.

He last saw her in Dublin a few days before she died, where she had enjoyed herself with her brothers and had seemed fine.

However, as she was leaving, she remembered one of their favourite songs and wrote the text message saying: ‘I don’t think I can do this any more.’

Mr Wilkinson added: ‘She was seeing a 
bereavement counsellor and was trying to deal with it but the note 
showed she did not want to live without Charles.’

Coroner Mary Hassell recorded a verdict of suicide as a result of ‘acute carbon monoxide poisoning’.

Miss Wilksinson grew up in West Sussex and married Mr Mason, a successful sculptor, in 1991. They did not have any children.

In
 2009, she designed costumes and sets for the critically acclaimed 2009 
production of Peer Gynt at the Barbican. She went on to work at other 
theatres including the Lyric, Hammersmith, the Sheffield Crucible, the 
Abbey in Dublin and the English and Scottish National Operas.
