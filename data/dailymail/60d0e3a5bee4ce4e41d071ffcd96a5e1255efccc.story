Saudi Arabian women will be forced to hide behind a screen when they take their place in the country's main advisory body.

A Saudi official says a screen will separate men and women on the Shura Council, which advises King Abdullah, when women join it for the first time.

King Abdullah made the decision to allow women to join the Shura Council, which is expected to reconvene early next year, but appears to be making a compromise with the nation's hardline Islamists, who oppose growing women's rights in the highly-segregated country.

Abdullah has pledged to allow women to vote and run in the next municipal elections in 2015. But Saudi women still face many restrictions, including a ban on driving.

The official, quoted in Al-Watan newspaper on Wednesday, says an internal communications network will allow men and women to communicate despite the barrier.

King Abdullah has insituted a number of reforms to the strict rules governing women in the oil-rich kingdom.

This summer Saudi women were allowed to compete in the Olympic Games for the first time.

Olympic bosses said the country could be disqualified for gender discrimination after it appeared to block female athletes from taking part, but the country relented.

Saudi Arabia is also planning to build a new city exclusively for women as it bids to combine strict Sharia law and career minded females, pursuing work.

It is thought the Saudi Industrial Property Authority has been asked to bring the country up to date with the rest of the modern world with the controversial city, which is now being designed with construction to begin next year.

It is hoped it will allow women’s desire to work without defying the country’s Islamic laws.
