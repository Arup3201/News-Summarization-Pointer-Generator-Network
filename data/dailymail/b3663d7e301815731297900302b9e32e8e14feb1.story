Runaway: Bernard Mr Jordan, a former Navy lieutenant, travelled alone from his care home in Hove, East Sussex, to the ceremonies in France

The veteran who escaped carers to go to the 70th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy is to be awarded the freedom of his home city.

Bernard Jordan, 89, is to be rewarded for his 'spirit and determination' after his audacious trip 'captured the imagination of all generations'.

Mr Jordan, a former Royal Navy lieutenant, made headlines after he travelled alone from his care home in Hove, East Sussex, to the commemoration ceremonies in France.

With his medals hidden under his coat, he slipped past carers, took the bus to Brighton station and caught the train to Portsmouth, where he boarded a ferry to Caen, Normandy.

Although he had no accreditation for the main event, he was allowed in and ended up sitting within 100 yards of the Queen and other world leaders at the poignant anniversary.

Brighton and Hove mayor Brian Fitch is recommending that Mr Jordan, who is himself a former mayor of the city, be awarded the freedom of Brighton and Hove - the highest honour the city can bestow.

He will join First World War hero Henry Allingham, the former world’s oldest man, and Olympic 800m gold medallist Steve Ovett in being awarded the city’s freedom.

Mr Fitch said he had invited Mr Jordan to the mayor’s parlour for a meeting to plan the city’s Armistice Day celebrations in November.

'I will be putting it to the council we should honour our heroes like Bernard Jordan who captured our imagination with his fantastic and successful effort in getting to Normandy against all the odds,' he said.

'It’s that spirit and determination that led Britain and its allies to liberate Europe from the tyranny of the Nazis.

'It’s not often you get the opportunity to give the city’s highest honour to someone who has served as a councillor but I feel that it’s really fitting to honour him in this way.'

Mr Jordan will celebrate his 90th birthday next week. The reports of his disappearance last week led a missing person's search with police checking hospitals, bus firms and taxi companies.

The hunt was only called off when a woman he met in France called up staff at The Pines care home to tell them where he was. Mr Jordan said he had expected to be in trouble, but instead carers gave him a hero’s welcome.

'I just wanted to go over and join in with the commemorations,' he said. 'Being a veteran myself, this was important to me and it meant the world to be there.

'I met some great characters - from old veterans to dancing girls - and I loved every minute. It was worth it.

'It was such an exciting experience - it was a smashing event but it is marvellous to be back.'

Since Brighton and Hove City Council was formed in 1997, the freedom of the city has been awarded to five people.

Flight Lieutenant Marc Heal, from Brighton, who rescued 29 injured troops during missions in Afghanistan, received the honour in 2011.

Burmese politician and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and local government reporter Adam Trimingham also have the honour.

Once nominated, a freeman would have to be a full council decision, requiring at least two-thirds to vote in favour.

A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said: 'The Freedom of the city is reserved for recognition of a person’s contribution to the city and local community over a period of time.

'They will usually have a local connection.

'Nominations are considered by our Leaders Group - the leaders of all three of our political groups - when they meet monthly.'

But the award must agreed by the full council before it can be bestowed
