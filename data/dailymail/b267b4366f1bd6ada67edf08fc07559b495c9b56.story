A collection of impressive jewels worn by the Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida at the height of her fame is to go under the hammer.

Twenty three of the star's Bulgari gems, worn at landmark moments during her career, are set to be sold at Sotheby's in May as part of the auction house's Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale.

The jewels, which were highlights of the international touring exhibition Bulgari –
125 Years of Italian Magnificence, include a 
Bulgari cushion-shaped diamond ring weighing 19.03 carats from 1962, a pair
of natural pearl and diamond pendants from 1964 and a diamond 
necklace/bracelet from 1954.

guide price of £163,000, and an emerald ring, estimated value  from the 
collection of actress Gina Lollobrigida set to be auctioned off for 
charity

collection of gems. The emerald earrings and brooch she wears here are 
to be sold in the auction

The actress, known fondly in her heyday as La Lollo, was a great collector of fine jewellery. Some she bought for herself, some she was gifted by admirers - of which there were many.

In an interview with Sotheby's magazine she said she adored the craftsmanship of each piece.

'I love the stones – the pearls and emeralds – because they are natural, the raw products of nature.

'Then there is the skill of the artist involved, the craftsmanship of turning these beautiful stones into works of art. Each one is like a sculpture.'

A pair of natural pearl and diamond pendants dating from 1964 are expected to fetch between $600,000 and $1m when they go under the hammer in May

Firm favourite: The actress was particularly fond of the pearl drop earrings, wearing them dozens of times over the years

Lollobrigida, who came from humble beginnings, rose to fame in the Fifties and Sixties and was one of the most popular actresses of the time, starring alongside Anthony Quinn n The Hunchback Of Notre Dame and Frank Sinatra in Never So Few.

A contemporary of Marilyn Monroe, when the two actresses were introduced in the U.S., Monroe confessed that she was often referred to as 'the American Lollobrigida'.

Today the multitalented actress, now 85, is a photojournalist and sculptor working out of her studio near Carrara, Italy.

Passion: Lollobrigida, again in the £635,000 ($1m) pearls, collected fine jewellery, saying she loved the 'craftsmanship' and detail of the pieces

The Magnificent Jewels sale also includes important diamonds including an 
internally flawless cushion-shaped diamond weighing 27.90 carats, a rare Kashmir sapphire ring weighing 11.71 carats 
and an impressive sapphire and diamond pendant-brooch weighing 43.27 
carats.

The Noble Jewels section features a cushion-shaped Fancy 
Yellow diamond jewel, weighing nearly 75 carats, formerly in the private
collection of His Late Imperial Majesty Sultan Ahmad Shah Qajar (b.1898
- d.1930), together with an important pink diamond and diamond necklace
set with a light pink brilliant-cut diamond weighing 6.93 carats and a 
circular-cut diamond weighing 34.78 carats.

Also featured is a 1965 Bulgari gem set 
and diamond necklace from a European Royal family. 

Ahead of the high profile sale, 
set to take place at Sotheby's Geneva on 14 May, highlights of the gem 
sale - including some of the Lollobrigida collection - will be on show 
at Sotheby's London, Hong Kong, New York, Rome, Paris and Zurich.

A portion of the proceeds from the sale will go to benefit stem cell research.

Dazzling: A pair of pear-shaped emerald and diamond Bulgari earclips has a top estimate of £130,676 ($200,000) while the emerald ring has an estimate of £117,608 ($180,000)

Luxe accessories: A diamond Tubogas wristwatch and Piaget evening bag, both with estimates of £9,000 ($13,782)
