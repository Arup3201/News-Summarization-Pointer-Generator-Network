Holding hands and smiling for the cameras, Tony and Cherie Blair were pictured heading for a night out together at the Chiltern Firehouse restaurant in London yesterday.

Clinging to her husband's arm, Cherie was grinning from ear to ear as she headed into London's trendiest new restaurant which has also welcomed the likes of Kate Moss, Harry Styles and Lily Allen.

The date-night outing is the latest effort by the pair to present a united front in the face of claims of a close relationship between Mr Blair, 60, and Wendi Deng, the former
 wife of Rupert Murdoch.

Tony and Cherie Blair were spotted in Marylebone, London, yesterday evening while heading for a meal out in the city's trendiest new restaurant

The pair were heading for Chiltern Firehouse, run by head-chef Nuno Mendes, which has become a favourite hang-out spot for the likes of Harry Styles, Kate Moss, Rita Ora and Lily Allen

It is the third time the pair have been seen in public together following allegations of Mr Blair's close relationship with Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng

Working his trademark 'relaxed' look made famous from his time as Prime Minister, Mr Blair stepped out in an open-necked checkered shirt with matching navy blue suit.

He also appeared to be wearing a Jawbone UP fitness band on his right wrist, also worn by the likes of Chancellor George Osborne, which measures heart-rate, calorie intake and the amount of sleep you get each day.

Mrs Blair meanwhile wore a floral-print dress teamed with a red trenchcoat and a thick silver necklace and matching bracelets.

The likes of Cara Delvigne and Suki Waterhouse have also been spotted walking through the doors

The Chiltern Firehouse also encompasses a hotel and club which has attracted the likes of Gary and Danielle Lineker (pictured leaving the club with friends)

The latest London outing comes after the couple were seen at LAX airport in Los Angeles last month after both giving talks in Beverly Hills at the Milken Institute Global Conference, a four
 day event looking at solutions to global social and economic 
challenges.

On that occasion Mrs Blair -  even though it looked slightly awkward - rested 
her face on the former Prime Minister's shoulder as they walked through 
the California airport to catch their departing flight.

Last month Mrs Blair, 59, was 
photographed looking glum on a break in Spain's Marbella, but yesterday 
she beamed as she arrived wearing a blue mac, a polka dot
 shirt and white trousers carrying a Louis Vuitton bag.

Mr
 Blair, 60, his hair thinner and more grey than when he was in power, 
wore a dark grey suit with a red tie and also looked more jovial.

Claims around Mr Blair's relationship surfaced after media mogul Mr Murdoch said he divorced his wife because of claims she was close to the former Prime Minister.

Last month Murdoch, 83, confirmed he was prompted to file for divorce 
by claims of Miss Deng's closeness to the former Labour party leader.

Murdoch
 said friends had kept him in the dark over alleged meetings between the
 pair at Murdoch's Californian ranch while he was away.

He told Fortune magazine: 'Well, you know, everybody was talking about these things and never telling me anything.

'But then I
 was told two pretty circumstantial things about the ranch. I was in 
Australia. When I got back, I naturally asked staff and it opened up,' Mr Murdoch added.

'That's the story. And then, you know, a week later I filed. As soon as I could find a lawyer.'

Although
 he did not name Mr Blair, his comments tally with claims in Vanity Fair
 magazine linking Mr Blair to at least two suspicious trysts at the 
ranch with Miss Deng.

It
 was alleged in February that Miss Deng, 45, had written notes to 
herself in which she praised Mr Blair's 'good body', his 'really, really
 good legs' and his 'butt'.

In a list 
of reasons why 'I'm so missing Tony', Chinese-born Miss Deng later 
gushed about his 'blue eyes which I love', it is claimed.

Mr
 Blair, who is godfather to one of Murdoch's daughters, has always 
denied any affair but has not spoken publicly about the claims.

He and Cherie have been married since 1980 and have four children; Euan, 30, Nicky, 28, Kathryn, 26, and Leo, 13.

Murdoch said he went straight to a divorce lawyer after hearing claims Blair and Miss Deng had met up while he was away

They
 were together at Euan's marriage to Suzanne Ashman at All Saints parish
 church in Wotton Underwood, Buckingshire, last September.

Mr Blair's travels 
the world in his new roles as business consultant and public speaker.

In
 the last year he has been seen disembarking from a £30million private 
jet at in Bangkok, Sardinia and New York state, and the top-of-the-range
 Bombardier Global Express private jet has also been seen in 
Switzerland, Ukraine and Israel on dates which matched Mr Blair’s 
visits.
