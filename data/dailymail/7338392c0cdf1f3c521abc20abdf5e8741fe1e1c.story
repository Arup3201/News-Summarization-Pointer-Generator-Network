Whenever things are going well at White Hart Lane, Tottenham's supporters rise as one to remind their great rivals they are back in the game.

'Stand up if you hate Arsenal' reverberated around this great arena after Tottenham scored their second and third goals in this Europa League play-off. That's what four wins on the spin can do to you.

No manager in Tottenham's history - and they've had a few in recent years - has got off to a start like this. Long may it continue.

Ratings by NEIL ASHTON at White Hart Lane 

This turned into an open training session against AEL Limassol, an exercise in possession and penetration as Mauricio Pochettino's team sailed into the group phase. 

The bigger picture is the Barclays Premier League and Sunday's fixture with Liverpool. Last year they lost 5-0 against a rampant Liverpool side at White Hart Lane and that cannot happen again. They owe Brendan Rodgers and his team.

Here, against opposition with limited ability and even less ambition, they were in cruise control. Harry Kane, who missed a first half penalty, Paulinho and Andros Townsend scored their goals. In truth it could have been many more.

'Our philosophy is to play football, to work hard, to play on the grass and at the moment the players are happy,' admitted Pochettino.

'That is important. Now we need to prepare for Sunday's game against Liverpool because it will be very different. 'They invested a lot of money, but we have chosen a different route.' They certainly have, but for now they can reflect on another impressive performance in front of those demanding supporters at White Hart Lane. Kane's chance came early, taking responsibility for Tottenham's first penalty when Kyle Naughton was taken out by Limassol keeper Karim Fegrouch in the sixth minute.

Spot of bother: Pulpo Romero saves Kane's spot kick early in the first half

It was a stupid, clumsy challenge that could easily have ended with a red card. In the event, he was forced off with an injury after seven minutes of treatment.

Kane missed his chance, blasting the ball straight at Limassol's substitute keeper Pupo Romero when the penalty was finally taken in the 13th minute.

'It is possible to miss penalty, that's not important,' claimed Pochettino.

'It is better for him to play and score. He showed character and the personality to recover. He's a very good player.' At times he looks it. Despite the disappointment, he was undeterred and so were Spurs. Kane had a couple of chances before the break, failing to even hit the target when he cottoned on to Aaron Lennon's clever backheel. 

Making sure: Paulinho scores Spurs' second goal of the night to put them in the driving seat

Job done: Paulinho celebrates his second half goal that put Spurs 4-1 up on aggregate 

He got there in the end, scoring in the 44th minute when Paulinho provided the incisive pass for Kane to streak into the box unmarked.

His finish, neatly taken off the instep of his right boot, was warmly received by the supporters inside White Hart Lane.

They see Kane as one of their own, a young man who has come through the youth ranks and sent on a tour of Championship teams to gain experience.

He signed a new five year contract earlier this month, a sign that his new manager likes what he sees in his young brood.

Spot on: Andros Townsend makes no mistake from the penalty spot as he makes it 3-0 on the night 

Marching on: Paulinho and Townsend celebrate as the winger scored his penalty 

Tottenham’s manager made nine changes from Sunday’s 4-0 demolition of QPR and their route into Friday's Europa League draw was never really in doubt.

The insurance policy, the first team players who have helped Tottenham to win their opening two games in the Barclays Premier League were on the bench. Just in case.

On the pitch they had three players - Paulinho, Moussa Dembele and Sandro - in the centre of midfield demanding the ball into their feet from Hugo Lloris. Paulinho scored their second, moving through the gears and finishing sweetly beyond Romero at the start of the second half. He deserved his goal for this assured performance.

Going close: Sandro has an unsuccessful shot on goal during Spurs' win

Job done: Kane celebrates at the end of the game as Spurs won 3-0

On to Aaron Lennon. The Tottenham winger deserved more from his majestic chip, beating the keeper from 18 yards only to see his effort deflected wide for a corner.

Still, they had time for one more. Kane stepped aside when they were awarded another penalty and Townsend, recalled to the England squad yesterday, made no mistake.

On Sunday, when Liverpool are back in town, they will discover just how far they have come.
