Radamel Falcao is set to make his Manchester United debut after a season-long loan move from Monaco

Radamel Falcao only spent one season at Monaco after a big-money move from Atletico Madrid

Porto 1-0 Braga, Europa League final - May 2011

A scrappy Europa League final at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin was settled by the Colombian's header just before half-time. Falcao adjusted his body by flinging his legs in the opposite direction, and guiding a header into the top corner.

The next three are in no particular order, but they were all special. Falcao scored a hat-trick to help his team brush aside the Champions League winners. His first was an excellent chipped finish past Petr Cech into the far corner, beyond the reach of a scrambling David Luiz.

In the 18th minute, Falcao doubled his tally and Atletico's lead on the night. He cut inside Ashley Cole onto his left foot and picked a spot in the top far corner beyond Cech's reach.

Falcao completed his hat-trick just before half-time with a clinical finish. His first touch left Ramires - who is no slouch - trailing in his wake before slotting the ball home under Cech in front of the ecstatic Atletico fans at Monaco's Stade Louis II.

Barcelona 4-1 Atletico Madrid, La Liga - December 2012

Although Barcelona came back to record a resounding victory, Falcao gave an experienced defence all kinds of problems in the first half. He threathened with a header that hit the post early on before latching on to a through ball and rolling his shot wide of the far post. But, on the half hour mark, Falcao left Sergio Busquets trailing in his wake before an exquisite chip over Victor Valdes to give Atletico the lead.

America Cali 1-2 Atletico Madrid, friendly - May 2012

This goal came on Atletico's mini tour of Colombia at the end of the 2011-12 season. It needs little explaining. A corner came in, and Falcao smashed it into the top corner with a stunning scissor kick.

Porto 4-1 Maritimo, Portuguese League, April 2010

Another one that needs little explaining. The striker shows just how athletic he is by thumping an overhead kick into the far corner.

Monaco 2-1 Lyon, Ligue 1 - October 2013

After soring seven goals in his first seven Ligue 1 games for Monaco, Falcao entered the match against Lyon at Stade Louis II on something of a drought by his lofty standards. He had gone three games without a goal, but scored the winner against Lyon with another brilliant chip that left goalkeeper Anthony Lopes completely stranded.

That goal is No 1 on the following video... Falcao's top five goals for Monaco in 2013-14. 

Porto 5-1 Villarreal, Europa League - April 2011

Porto trailed 1-0 at half-time in this semi-final showdown, but mounted an excellent response in the second half at the Estadio Do Dragao. Falcao scored four of his team's five second-half goals, including a diving header where he flew through the air and picked his spot in the bottom corner.

Atletico Madrid 4-2 Valencia, Europa League - April 2012

Falcao looked to have lost his way after cutting inside having initially been set free with a through ball. But the Colombian took another touch to get the ball out of his feet before firing into the top corner, with the help of the crossbar, from outside the penalty area.
