The men of the Bridgeport Sound Tigers changed their names to honor the children murdered in the Sandy Hook school massacre as they took to the ice last night.

The hockey team donned all black uniforms with the names of the 20 schoolchildren who tragically lost their lives when Adam Lanza forced his way into the school and began firing.

Before the game, the team lined up on the blue line to observe a moment of silence for the children and the six adults who were also gunned down in the shooting.

It's not the first time the Sound Tigers, a minor league affiliate of the New York Islanders, have stepped up for the community since the shooting.
