A medicine stockpiled by the Department of Health to hand out to millions of Britons during a flu pandemic may not even work, MPs warn.

Some £424million has been spent on supplies of Tamiflu since 2006, yet there is no clear evidence available that it is effective.

A flu pandemic, which relates to an epidemic crossing a large geographical area, is considered by the Government to be a far deadlier risk to Britons than a terrorism attack or weather catastrophe. However, we may have little protection against it.

Stockpiled: A box a Tamiflu and loose capsules of the drug. But ministers have been warned the drug may not work

A report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee accuses NHS watchdogs of not demanding enough evidence from drugs firms on the safety of their products before allowing them to be used by British patients.

NICE decides which drugs are used on the NHS and the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approves them for public and private use. The MPs' report accuses both of just 'taking manufacturers' word for it' that drugs work.

If that is the case, millions of patients could be taking medicines which are ineffective and may have potentially dangerous side-effects.

Tory MP Richard Bacon, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee, said: 'The full results of clinical trials are being routinely and legally withheld from doctors and researchers by the manufacturers of medicines.

'This has ramifications for the whole of medicine. The ability of doctors, researchers and patients to make informed decisions about treatments is being undermined. This is of extreme concern to this committee.

'There is still a lack of consensus over how well the antiviral medicine Tamiflu, stockpiled for use in an influenza pandemic, actually works.'

Tamiflu is made by Swiss firm Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland

The Department of Health bought Tamiflu from Swiss drugs manufacturer Roche. It was widely distributed among GPs and private companies during the 2009/10 swine flu scare but very little was used because the pandemic never materialised.

Officials calculated that the drug would reduce the likelihood of death and complications such as pneumonia by up to 50 per cent but the new report warns that this was based on 'judgment' rather than 'evidence'.

The report says that the MHRA only looked at a handful of trials on Tamiflu, nearly all which were actually funded by its manufacturer, Roche.

And in 2010, the Government had to throw away £74million worth of the drug which had been distributed across the country because health officials had forgotten to tell people how to correctly store it.

Tamiflu is meant to be kept at temperatures below 77F (25C) but the Department of Health did not include this guidance with the supplies. When the stock was sent back to Whitehall after the scare had passed, officials were forced to dispose of it in case it was no longer effective.

The MPs also warn that only half of clinical trials are ever published and positive results which show drugs to be effective are twice as likely to be made public than negative ones.

Richard Stephens, a cancer patient who has taken part in five clinical trials, said: 'Patients have a right to know that the medicines they are being given are the best available.

'How can we have informed choice if somebody is keeping back the information we need to make the choice?

'Patients participate in clinical trials because we expect the information to be of use to other patients. It is downright immoral to keep recruiting sick people to them if you aren't going to make all the results known.'
