Discovery: The body of 34-year-old Karl Law, from Fareham, Hampshire, has been discovered in a river in central Prague, three weeks after he went missing 

'The body found on Sunday was Karl. I thank everyone for their support,' Ms Collins, who has son Lenny, three, with Mr Law, wrote on her Facebook page. 

The body was found in Vltava river, close to Jiraskuv Bridge in Prague's city centre on Sunday, but was so badly decomposed police said DNA tests were required

Mr Law, who would have turned 35 on December 4th, vanished during his cousin Lee Cross's stag party in Prague last month.

His friends saw him for the last time on Saturday November 15th about 11:30 PM in Prague's Old Town. 

'The man had been in the water for three to five weeks, and it is not possible to do a proper identification because of the body's condition,' Police spokesman Andrea Zoulova said. 

The body found  in the river Vltava in the Czech capital was severely decomposed and is estimated to have been in the water for three to five weeks, which could fit with Mr Law who disappeared on November 15th

It is not possible to confirm ID without a DNA test but family who have seen the clothes found on the body say that they do not match those Mr Law was wearing when he disappeared 

Family say they do not believe the body is Mr La

'But there is a very real possibility that it might be the missing British citizen which is one of scenario's the investigators are considering.'

Mr Law's death was confirmed hours after his mother Sue arrived in Prague to join the hunt for her son. 

Relatives including Karl's brother Craig, 30, had put up posters on subway stations and lap-posts around the city to try and locate him.

Ms Collins has told the couple's son Lenny that his father was away on a fishing trip on behalf is supermarket giants Asda.

When the body was first discovered, Mr Law's cousin Steve Stock, who was called to Prague police to identify Mr Law's clothes, said he was convinced that it was not Mr Law as the clothes did not belong to his cousin.

Tributes to Mr Law have been flooding in on the Facebook page 'Please help find Karl Law in Prague' since the news broke of his death

Bekki Piper wrote: 'Thinking of everyone that knew him, especially his son, heartbreaking news. RIP Karl.'

Claire Short said: 'Thoughts with Karl's family friends, Amanda and her little boy.'

Jeanette Muldoon wrote on Facebook: 'So sorry to hear the awful news. You as a family have done so much to find him. Your love for him is indisputable.'

A post-mortem is being carried out to determine the cause of death.
