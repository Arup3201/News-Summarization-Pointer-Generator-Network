A young boy has credited his pet Labrador with protecting him for a crippling condition that affects his nervous system.

Brad Oliver has a rare disorder which means his heart races every time he stands up or becomes excited – this alters the blood supply to his brain, causing him to pass out.

But, three-year-old Fudge, a golden Labrador, instinctively knows when Brad is about to fall ill and has kept him out of harm’s way on countless occasions.

Brad Oliver, 11, has a rare condition which means his heart beats too fast when he moves meaning the blood supply to his brain is compromised and he is in danger of fainting. Fudge sits by him when his heart is beating too fast to warn him not to stand up

Brad, who turns 11 next week, has postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) which causes dizziness, fainting, tiredness, palpitations, shortness of breath and headaches.

He suffers up to 200 blinding ‘ice pick’ head pains a day as well as nausea and blurred vision.

Brad, from Chudleigh, in Devon, is so vulnerable, he has to be taught at home and to remain constantly in temperatures of 18 - 21C because a sudden change of temperature could cause him to fall ill.

His heart can race dangerously if he eats any number of common foods including meat, dairy, fish and bread.

Fresh strawberries are one of the few things he can enjoy and his mother, Katrina - widowed while pregnant when her husband was killed in a car crash - can travel up to 50 miles a day to find the four punnets a day he eats.

‘Brad was seven days old when his heart first went funny, he went stiff then limp in my arms and we ended up in hospital,’ said Mrs Oliver.

‘Now he has to wait two hours before 
getting up each morning and we have to pace his whole day. If we don’t, 
Brad can be knocked off his feet for over three weeks.

‘I think sometimes life throws things at us to make us stronger.’

If Brad blacks out, Fudge finds his mother, Katrina, to warn her. Fudge is not trained to help Brad - he is just a pet who happens to have an instinctive ability to help the child

But Brad’s life changed for the better three years ago when Fudge came along.

He chose the runt of the litter because she had the ‘waggiest tail’.

‘She kept diving for him,’ said Mrs Oliver.

‘At four-days-old she started acting a bit strangely, sitting across his legs and not wanting to get off.

‘She wouldn’t let Brad get up so we moved her and shortly afterwards Brad collapsed.

‘We realised later this had developed into a pattern, Fudge knew when Brad was going to have an attack.

‘Even if he was upstairs being poorly in bed and I didn’t know, Fudge would be at the bottom of the stairs crying.

PoTS is an abnormal response by the autonomic nervous system to becoming upright - the autonomic nervous system is in charge of all of the automatic bodily functions, such as sweating and digestion.

The condition causes the heart rate to increase and alters the blood supply to the brain.

There are many causes -  pregnancy, viral illnesses, surgery, rapid growth spurts and bed rest - but, in some cases, no cause can be found.

Some patients are severely disabled by the condition while others have mild symptoms.

Symptoms include:

Symptoms can be triggered by excess heat, eating, standing up, dehydration, alcohol and exercise.

‘A couple of times she came up to me to let me know I’m not moving fast enough.

‘It’s
 also happened when Brad’s been in the downstairs bathroom and he’s 
become unwell. Fudge will go running up to the door crying.

‘Brad used to end up in hospital a lot with concussion because he’d fall and hit his head, but now Fudge either cries or puts her paw on his arm warning him to sit down.

‘She just guards him the whole time and you know he’s not well. When she’s happy and running around we know Brad is in a good place too.

‘She doesn’t miss an occasion. When Brad had a loop recorder implanted to monitor his heart, it showed afterwards that every time he’d been extremely tachycardic [his heart has been beating much too fast] I’d entered ‘F’ into the manual log I kept and that meant “Fudge”, she had known he wasn’t well.

‘Sometimes I worry about her because it’s like she’s always working all the time although of course she’s never been trained to do this, it’s purely instinct.

‘Even if Brad goes out cold Fudge will let us know if it’s serious or he’ll come round by the way she’s laying by his feet, she just won’t leave if he’s bad.

‘When Brad’s going to collapse she tends to pin him down but if he’s about to have a head pain she’ll paw him more or go and sit beside him and give a little nudge, it’s really strange.

‘She helps him in so many ways.

‘The one disadvantage for Brad is that he can never lie about feeling unwell to get out of doing things because Fudge gives the game away.’

Howard Liebermann, a partner at the Kingsteignton Vets Practice where Fudge is looked after, said: ‘It’s not uncommon for dogs to be trained to predict when people might be at risk of an epileptic fit, but Fudge is the first dog I know of who has taken it on themselves to become a child’s protector like this.’

One of the reasons the Olivers decided to talk about their plight was to help raise the profile of Syncope Trust and Reflex Anoxic Seizures (Stars) – the charity which has helped them.

Mrs Oliver said: 'It was only through the group that Brad was given a diagnosis and referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital. Ever since it has been on hand to provide advice and practical support.

'They are a fantastic charity, a lot of people get misdiagnosed with epilepsy when in fact it’s a type of syncope.

'Quite rightly the big cancer charities are well known but not Stars, nor Syncope or Pots – yet more people die of heart conditions than cancer.

'No one really knows how many people live with it and to raise awareness would be fantastic, it might help find a cure.'

Shy Brad admitted that Fudge was his best friend and a ‘good dog’. He had one message: 'Make sure you love life.'
