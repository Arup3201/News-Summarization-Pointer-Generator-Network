Some chimps like to monkey around but others prefer to sit about contemplating life like this chap who recalled Auguste Rodin's statue of The Thinker. 

The primate was snapped deep in thought in Sri Lanka last September and looks just like the bronze cast made famous by French sculptor Auguste Rodin in the early 20th century.

Amateur photographer Thasan Sakthi, 65, from Grays, Essex, was delighted when he saw the shot after spotting the ape acting just like a human.

 Thasan said: "I liked the way the monkey was sitting on a food tray with his hand on his face. The expression on his face looks more like a human.

"I was shocked to see its behaviour so I took some pictures of the monkey and its mother as well.

"I like to tell a story through my pictures and this picture gave me that pleasure to do that."

Thasan has traveled the world with his trusty Nikon D700 and D800 cameras since retiring. 

Thasan added: "I always like to travel and I went to some exotic places this year to take pictures - that's what I like to do most of the time.

"The first time I put this picture on show at my camera club the judge liked it and gave it the highest score that he could and I got a good response from people online too."
