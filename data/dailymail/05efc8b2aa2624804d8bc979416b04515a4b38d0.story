A group of pranksters managed to trick more than a dozen art lovers into thinking that a cheap print from IKEA was a valuable work of modern art.

Dutch YouTube jokers lifehunterstv took a £7(10 euro) print and placed it in an art museum in Arnhem, and asked visitors what they thought of the 'painting' and how much it could be worth.

Several art fans praised the IKEA print, with some valuing it to £1.8million(2.5million euro), before being told of the hoax.

Funny guys: A group of Dutch YouTube jokers took a £7 print from IKEA and placed it in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem

The team from lifehunterstv placed the cheap canvas on display in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem, and asked art lovers for an appraisal.

They told visitors the painting was done by famous Swedish artist 'IKE Andrews', and, according to the pranksters, all of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie.

The video shows presenter Boris Lange talking about the painting to a number of visitors, who call the cheap print 'modern' and 'shocking'.

One man praises the print for its 'constructiveness of things on top of each other, inside each other'.

Another  visitor, a man in a flatcap, beard and glasses, claims he can 'clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism', adding that the artist has a 'beautiful spirit'.

When asked how much they believe the artwork to be worth, one guesses 'over 1,000 euro', while another says: 'If you could buy this for 2.5million euros, I'd do it.'

'The whole day everyone thought our "painting" amazing,' the team behind the prank says. 

'When the people talked about that this image is a symbol of the painters spirit, and that it could be worth a 200,000 euros or even 2.5million euros it made us laugh inside!'

When the pranksters told the art fans about their IKEA hoax, a majority saw the funny side, but, lifehunterstv reveals, not all were pleased about being duped.  

'The last two guys couldn't even say one word as a reaction and just walked away with red cheeks. We could feel the awkwardness'.

Hit a nerve? Two men who had praised the painting were so offended when told that it was a cheap IKEA print that they left without a word 

This comes just days after IKEA customers in the Netherlands were stopped from organising a mass-game of hide and seek.

A whopping 19,000 people signed up to a Facebook group promoting a game at IKEA's Amsterdam branch next month, and another 13,000 signed up for a game in the Ikea store in the city of Utrecht.

But the Swedish retail giant has bad news for folks wanting to hide among its room-like furniture displays: The numbers signing up are getting out of hand and the events have been blocked.

'We have contacted these pages on social media and humbly asked them to have their hide and seek games somewhere else,' IKEA spokeswoman Martina Smedberg said Tuesday.

Ms Smedberg added that IKEA does not want to be a spoilsport, but safety comes first.
