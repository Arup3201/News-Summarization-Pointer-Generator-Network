In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday night the Australian businessman accused of masterminding an international paedophile ring revealed he is writing a journal that will serve as a confession for his alleged depraved crimes. 

Speaking from behind bars to 60 Minutes' Tara Brown, Peter Gerard Scully, 52, was evasive, non-committal and vague throughout the interview. But Scully hoped that the journal he was writing would help explain his mental state and the motivations behind his actions.

He was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, and killing another young girl, leading to calls for the reintroduction of the death penalty.

Relaxed and in control throughout the interview, Scully kept referring to a journal that he was now writing in prison and that the reasons for his horrific actions that he details in it could only be explained by a psychiatrist.

'What I'm looking for is the real reason why I took that road and what drove me to that, because in Australia I wasn't like that,' he said.

However, for every direct question Ms Brown had, Scully had an equally opaque answer. 

'I don't want to get into any of that... Are we almost done? Because we seem to be going round in circles,' he said at one stage.

Asked by Ms Brown if he had any remorse for his actions he said that he did, but could not say exactly when he felt this.

'That's a good question. There's different degrees of remorse when you finally realise what you have done,' he said. 

‘At what point do you have remorse? I can't answer that honestly yet.'

When pressed on why he did what he did his only answer was to 'ask the psychiatrist that question'. 

'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Ms Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 

Ms Brown went behind bars to face Scully in a prison in Cagayan de Oro in the country's south, where Scully is currently being held, and will be tried at the same location, facing life in prison if found guilty. 

Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.  

The father-of-two slipped out of Melbourne after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences and fled to Manila in 2011 where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. 

Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. 

Videos seized in the Philippines last week, including one called 'The Destruction of Daisy', allegedly show a 13-year-old girl being forced to perform 'horrific' acts of whipping and torture with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. 

The 60 Minutes team was on the ground when Scully was arrested after the remains of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon and authorities, who had been keeping the 51-year-old under surveillance, swooped on his house.

'We went inside his house of horrors, right into the heart of darkness to understand exactly why it was so important that he was taken off the street,' said Ms Brown.

Scully is accused of feeding a global market of paedophilic videos, charging up to $10,000 for footage of children being tortured and abused by other underage victims. 

Ms Brown claimed that several of the young girls who were groomed by Scully became partners in his video ring, falling 'into his net, manipulated to become girlfriends and later accomplices', including Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez.

'Part of me feels sorry for them, but I can't understand taking it to the next step into torture and possibly murder,' she said. 

Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, allegedly approached two cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie.

She offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house.

Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them.

The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task.

'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened,' Scully said earlier in the week

Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators.

It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other. 

'You don't want to overuse the word monster, but that is what he is. He is the face of global perversion' said Ms Brown.  

'This story is so confronting, it's a story about all lines being crossed, not just once, but repeatedly. We are talking about the sexual abuse of an 11-month-old, and the misery and lead up to the alleged death of another,' she said.

Ms Brown said that Scully, a father of two grown children, claims to have remorse for his crimes.

'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened. That is something to talk about in the court which is the proper forum. There's nothing I can do to change what they [the girls] said,' Scully told The Sydney Morning Herald earlier in the week.  

Ms Brown said that as a mother of two young boys she is very aware of how 'innocent and trusting young people are'.

'It adds to the tragedy. It's almost beyond belief that there is something so dark within some people and when they act on that it's the most innocent that are their victims,' she said.

'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.

Scully said that he isn't concerned about being sentenced to life in prison.

'If I get sentenced, I get sentenced. That is something out of my control,' he said.

'I get bigger than Ben-Hur and people get interested. There is nothing I can do about it, so why worry about it?' Scully said.  

The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death.

'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said.
