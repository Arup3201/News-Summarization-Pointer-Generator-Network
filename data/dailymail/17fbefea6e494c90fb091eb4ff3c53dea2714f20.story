A new batch of Australian anti-drinking videos encouraging young people to hold back on the booze is actually doing more harm than good, experts warn.

The DrinkWise videos form part of a new anti-booze campaign designed to detract young people from hitting the bottle. The online ads, posted to YouTube, feature a man in a suit promoting drinking as a classy social activity only to be enjoyed in moderation.

Drunks are portrayed as 'dickheads' and the message that drinking ruins reputations, is an unattractive social norm and inhibits men's appeal to the opposite sex is a recurring theme throughout.

It is implied that sober men are more appealing to mothers, and this is a reason why men shouldn't get drunk

The mostly minute-long 'Classy as F***' videos  attempt to offer tips on how to be an 'experienced' drinker rather than an 'amateur.' One video even implies sober men have a better chance of sleeping with older women.

'There's a place for mothers,' the narrator says, before cutting to a scene of two mothers propped up in bed alongside the man in the suave suit.

But the sleek, black and white animated ads may be having the opposite affect of their good intentions. Results of a university study show that young people actually felt the urge to drink after viewing one of the 'How To Drink Properly' advertisements.

The downsides of drinking are not as unappealing as the videos aim to make out. Researchers say one in particular is encouraging young people's drinking habits.

The campaign CEO has defended the videos saying they are hitting the mark with their intended audience

Professor Simone Pettigrew, who co-authored a letter published in the Medical Journal of Australia, said: 'What DrinkWise is touting as being helpful is just reinforcing their sales.'

What's worse, she said, is that the videos are online and are likely to be watched by children. The study by Prof Simone Pettigrew and her team at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia showed about two thirds of the 40 people who viewed the ad said the animation format appealed to them, as did the humour and swearing.

She said while the video's message of discouraging people from drinking too much is helpful, it fails to inform people how much 'too much' actually is.

'The video fails to tell them more than four drinks is binge drinking,' Prof Pettigrew said. 'They think 10 beers is OK.'

But DrinkWise CEO John Scott said the campaign was achieving its aims. 'We are weeks into a three-year campaign, but we are confident we have hit the right mark,' he said.

He said a DrinkWise study of more than 750 young people had changed their behaviour after seeing the video. 'It shows the campaign is doing the right things. We are speaking to young people for the first time in a language in which they can start to understand the moderation message.'

In one of the advertisements offering anti-drinking tips, the narrator says people should consider against forking out on a loan to pay for more shots at the bar
