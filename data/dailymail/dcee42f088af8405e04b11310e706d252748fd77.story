The first and only racehorse to belong to the Countess of Wessex has been put down following a tragic accident.

Prince Edward’s wife Sophie was told the news shortly before she joined the rest of the Royal Family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch the Trooping the Colour last Saturday.

By contrast with other members of the Royal Family, the Countess appeared saddened and deep in thought at moments.

Three-year-old bay colt Zilber shattered his pelvis in a freak accident while training at Newmarket early that morning.

Sophie was telephoned by trainer Ed Dunlop, who told her the horse had been put down.

The Countess is said be ‘very sad’ about the death. The Royal Family and close friends have offered her sympathy over what is seen in racing circles as ‘very bad luck’.

Mr Dunlop said: ‘It’s very sad for the Countess and everyone else involved. It’s a very sad day whenever you lose a horse.’

In a common arrangement in horse-racing, the Countess had leased Zilber, worth at least  £30,000, in a partnership with her friend, the Countess of Derby, and Mandy Koukash, wife of leading British racehorse owner Dr Marwan Koukash.

The loss of Zilber is a blow for the Countess and her plans to become more deeply involved in horse-racing. Married to Prince Edward for 15 years – the couple celebrated their anniversary on Thursday –  she picked up the racing bug from her mother-in-law, the Queen.

The Countess has even acquired her own racing colours: a purple and yellow diabolo strip worn by her jockeys.

Adam Kirby was wearing the racing silks when the Countess watched him and Zilber finish third in the Alex Scott Maiden Stakes at Newmarket on April 16.

Zilber had been taken out at 7am last Saturday from the trainer’s La Grange stables. After a walk and warm-up, Zilber set out for a brisk canter in the Al Bahatri gallops when he fell.

While most horses can recover from a fractured pelvis, a vet judged the injury so severe the horse had to be put down.

A spokesman for Mr Dunlop added: ‘It was extremely unlucky. It is a freak occurrence. The result is unfortunate and a sad first experience for the Countess of Wessex. The staff who look after him are very upset.’

Later that morning, wearing an elegant, white-lace Bruce Oldfield dress, Sophie joined the Queen and other members of the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace.

A Palace spokesman said: ‘The Countess of Wessex was part of a partnership who leased Zilber.

‘The horse was sadly put down on veterinary advice. The Countess was informed last week.’
