Re-live all the drama here 

Jack Wilshere has taken to Instagram to welcome his England team-mate and new Arsenal signing Danny Welbeck to the team.

Welbeck sealed a £16million move from Manchester United to Arsenal in the closing hours of transfer deadline day on Monday and Wilshere seems delighted to have 'another English lad' in the Gunners squad.

He wrote: 'Big welcome to my boy Welbz....great player for a great club! Another English lad! #Gooner'.

The pair are currently on international duty with England as Roy Hodgson's side prepare for the friendly match against Norway on Wednesday ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland on Monday.  

Welbeck, told he could leave Old Trafford after failing to impress Louis van Gaal since the Dutchman’s arrival this summer, was originally offered on a season long loan deal for a bargain £3m. 

But the 23-year-old was determined to force a permanent move to give himself a fresh start and that helped Arsenal force down United’s original £18m asking price before settling a five-year contract for the player.

Return: Welbeck has scored 20 league goals for United in 90 appearances since 2008

Wenger had several times claimed he wasn’t in the market for a new striker, despite losing last season’s top scorer Olivier Giroud until after Christmas through injury.

But that emerged as a smokescreen as he made failed overtures for first Loic Remy then Radamel Falcao, before turning his attention to Welbeck.

And with Tottenham put off by the size of the numbers involved, Arsenal officials worked late into the night to complete the formalities.

Mesut Ozil was one of several Arsenal stars to tweet their delight at Welbeck's signing, saying: 'I'm glad to welcome you, Danny! wish you as much goals as possible! #WelcomeWelbeck #NewStriker #No23 #COYG'.  

Fresh start: Welbeck has enjoyed previous loan spells with Preston North End and Sunderland

Wenger has long been an admirer of Welbeck and has considered a move for him in the past, but he had always viewed the United man as a player who is best suited to playing on the flanks, posing a goal threat from wide.

Sportsmail can reveal that Wenger originally had Welbeck earmarked as a possible replacement for Lukas Podolski, who was set to leave Arsenal earlier this summer. But with the Gunners so short of striking options following Giroud’s serious ankle injury, the Germany forward will be asked to play in a central role.

Welbeck, who has 26 caps for England at the age of 23, has eight international goals. He has scored 20 league goals in 90 appearances for United since 2008. 

Goals: Falcao has been prolific throughout his career, earning several big money moves
