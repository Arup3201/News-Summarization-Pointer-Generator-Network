Russia's Ekaterina Makarova reached her second successive grand slam semi-final on Tuesday, defeating third seed Simona Halep in straight sets in the Australian Open.

Makarova, who lost to eventual winner Serena Williams in the last four of the US Open last year, needed just 69 minutes to overpower Halep 6-4, 6-0 in the day's first quarter-final on Rod Laver Arena.

Neither player had lost a set in the previous four rounds but it was Makarova who always looked the most likely winner, racing into a 3-0 lead with two breaks of serve as Halep committed a string of unforced errors.

The 23-year-old Romanian did recover one of the breaks to register her first game and held to trail 2-4, but could not find another breakthrough as Makarova made the most of her swinging left-handed serve.

The No 11 seed Makarova, 26, then cruised through the second set to set up a semi-final with either second seed Maria Sharapova or seventh seed Eugenie Bouchard.

'It's a great feeling, I'm so happy that I came through,' Makarova said in an on-court interview.

'She is a tough opponent and I lost to her (in their only previous meeting) two years ago. She never gives up, she is always fighting and every point is long.

'It was really tough and I am happy that I stayed solid and in my game.

'I was used to being in quarter-finals (in grand slams) so now I have to get used to being in semi-finals.'

Halep admitted she lost belief in the second set, adding: 'I practised very well in the morning, but maybe I was a little bit too stressed before I started the match. I had a bad day but she played well and everything was in for her so she deserves to win.

'I'm really sad a little bit now that I could not play my tennis, my game, but that's tennis and I have to look forward to the next tournament.

'I cannot say (it was) pressure. Just I was a little bit stressed. I don't know why. I had experience from last year of playing quarter-finals, so it doesn't mean that I felt pressure.

'But sometimes you cannot manage the situation, just mentally because during the points maybe I didn't fight very well today. I just lost my concentration to win the points, to win the match. So I didn't believe any more in the second set, and that's maybe why I lost 6-0.'
