QPR have been charged by the Football Association with failing to control their players during the 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw against Manchester City on Saturday.

Rangers players were incensed when referee Mike Riley denied striker Charlie Austin two goals in the eighth minute - the first for offside and the second for an infringement by City goalkeeper Joe Hart.

An FA statement read: 'It is alleged that in or around the 8th minute of the fixture, the club failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion.

Joe Hart stumbled slightly in his run up before appearing to give the ball straight to Austin from a free-kick

Hart had actually caught the ball with his standing foot, meaning that he had played the ball twice in the box, and had to retake the kick as a result

QPR players were incensed with referee Mike Dean after seeing two goals disallowed inside a minute

'The club has until 6pm on 17 November 2014 to respond to the charge.'

Austin did eventually score a goal that counted in the 21st minute to put QPR ahead but two Sergio Aguero goals sandwiched an own goal from Martin Demichelis as the spoils were shared.

Harry Redknapp's men were not the only side to be charged with his offence on Thursday, as Sunderland also had action take against them from the FA after their players reaction to the award of an Everton penalty on Sunday - which Leighton Baines scored from.
