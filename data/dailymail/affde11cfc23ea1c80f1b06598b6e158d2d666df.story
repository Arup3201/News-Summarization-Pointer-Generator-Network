Controlled explosions have been carried out on ageing detonators, which were found near to the Army's biggest training centre.

The detonators were discovered as police carried out extensive searches around the Marne Barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire following reports of an explosion in the early hours of this morning, which resulted in a six-mile stretch of the A1 being closed for most of the day.

However, police have stressed that the detonators were not the cause of the sound of the earlier blast, which still remains unexplained and a mystery.

Officers have also ruled out any link to terrorism and have confirmed that the closed stretch of carriageway has now reopened.

Police were called to the barracks at 3am this morning after staff there reported that they had heard an explosion.

There were no other reports of damage in the area and police found no obvious signs of an explosion.

The searches included experts from the North East Counter Terrorism Unit, explosive detection dogs, the National Police Air Service and military search personnel.

Witnesses also described seeing police vans, a police dog vehicle, ambulances, and military cars at the scene, where armed officers were also stationed.

But despite their investigation they were unable to find anything which may have cause the sound of the explosion. 

And now police have defended their decision to close a six-mile stretch of the A1 near to Catterick for most of the day.  

Superintendent Dave Hannan of North Yorkshire Police said: 'We are satisfied that the call to the police was made with good intent.

Armed military officers (pictured) were positioned at the road closure, which is near Marne Barracks 

A statement from the Highways Agency said the closure of the carriageway had led to a 40-minute delays

Witnesses said that those living in the area were woken up by a loud bang at about 3am this morning

'We appreciate that members of the public will ask why the road had to be shut for so long.

'In view of the location of the suspected explosion, the source of the information, the current threat to UK security and a report a few hours earlier of a vehicle seen in suspicious circumstances outside the barracks, we were not prepared to take any chances with people's safety and had to carry out a very extensive and thorough investigation.

'Officers have worked throughout the night and day to identify and locate the driver of the vehicle and we are now satisfied that he was not connected to the reported explosion and we have now eliminated him from our enquiries.

'We thank the driver of the vehicle for his patience and cooperation. We have also ruled out any link to terrorism.

A spokeswoman said the police were taking 'all precautions' because of the location of the reported explosion

'I again extend our thanks to members of the public who were caught up in the congestion for their patience and understanding. Their safety was our prime concern.

'We may never find out what the source of the explosion was, however, following the search and investigation I am now satisfied that there is no threat to members of the public.

'A number of possibilities have been looked into, however, there is no information or evidence to say this reported explosion was a criminal or deliberate act.'

On the Ministry of Defence website, Catterick Garrison is described as the army's 'largest training establishment'. It covers 2,400 acres and 20,000 acres of training land.

The Garrison is situated just a few miles from the A1 and includes Marne Barracks near Catterick Village and the outstations of Ripon, Dishforth and Topcliffe.

Catterick Garrison provides a base for Headquarters 4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East which forms part of 1st (United Kingdom) Division.
