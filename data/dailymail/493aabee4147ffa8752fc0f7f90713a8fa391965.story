Wes Morgan had a night to forget as Leicester remain rooted to the bottom of the Premier League following a 3-1 loss at home to Liverpool on Tuesday night.

Morgan endured a torrid display against the Reds' attack before being sent off for hauling down Rickie Lambert in the second half.

In contrast, his opposing skipper Steven Gerrard put in fine performance as Liverpool's mini-revival continued.

The 34-year-old gave his side a 2-1 lead with a trademark finish, to cap a brilliant display against the Premier League newcomers.

LEICESTER (4-4-2)

Kasper Schmeichel 5 

Glaring error for the third goal, and should have given a penalty away after bringing down Steven Gerrard.

Ritchie De Laet 5 

Dealt well with Sterling, but final ball should have been better.

Wes Morgan 4 

Sent off and looked sloppy all evening.

Referee Lee Mason (centre) had no doubts in his mind that Morgan (right) was the last man after his foul

Marcin Wasilewski 5.5

Stood up to Lambert and impressed with physicality.

Paul Konchesky 5 

Solid but it’s no wonder his former employers let him go…

Riyad Mahrez (centre) was busy against Liverpool but lacked a killer ball in the final third to hurt their defence

Riyad Mahrez 5

Cut in well from the right-hand side but again final ball was lacking.

Esteban Cambiasso 5.5 

Classy in midfield and still possesses that engine.

Matty James 5 

Good industry but Gerrard got away from him at times.

Jeffrey Schlupp 5

Good pace down the left but wasn’t in the game enough.

Jamie Vardy 5.5

Ran his socks off and troubled Martin Skrtel and Kolo Toure in behind.

Leonardo Ulloa 6.5

Great play for the opener and kept the defenders occupied.

Subs

Marc Albrighton 5

Replaced Konchesky with 10 minutes to go but had little time to make an impact.

LIVERPOOL (4-2-3-1)

Simon Mignolet 5.5

Had another poor game, scoring an own goal and should have been punished by Esteban Cambiasso for a sloppy clearance prior to that.

Manquillo 5 

Failed to impress in the first half and was replaced at half-time by Alberto Moreno. 

Martin Skrtel 6

Solid in defence overall but looked nervous when Leicester pressed for an equaliser. 

Kolo Toure 6

A decent performance from the veteran defender who deserves to keep Dejan Lovren out of the team on current form. 

Glen Johnson 6

Decent outlet going forward for the visitors, but lost possession that led to the hosts opener.

Jordan Henderon (left) scored Liverpool's third goal in their 3-1 victory at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday

Jordan Henderson 7

Industrious in midfield as always and took his goal well. 

Lucas 7

Solid anchor in Liverpool's midfield which gave the defence extra stability. 

Adam Lallana 7 

Took his goal really well in what was arguably his best performance in a Reds shirt. 

Adam Lallana (centre) scored Liverpool's equaliser in the first half with a sweetly-struck left-footed strike

Steven Gerrard 8 - STAR MAN

Who says the Liverpool skipper is a fading force? Scored the goal to give Liverpool the lead with a trademark finish. 

Raheem Sterling 7 

Another good performance from the England winger who was involved in everything positive they did. 

Rickie Lambert 7

Provided the knockdown for Lallana's goal. Seems to be growing more and more as a Liverpool player.

Subs

Alberto Moreno 5

Came on at half-time for the ineffective Manquillo but failed to make a major impact.

Joe Allen 5 

Replaced Lallana with 15 minutes remaining but was largely anonymous.

Dejan Lovren 

Came on in the 90th minute. Had no time to make any contribution.
