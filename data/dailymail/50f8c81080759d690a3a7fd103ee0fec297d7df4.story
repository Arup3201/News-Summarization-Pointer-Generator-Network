The sole survivor of the elite firefighter team that perished battling a raging wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona last week paid tribute to his fallen brothers with a heartfelt prayer.

At a memorial held Tuesday in Prescott, Arizona, Brendan McDonough took the stage in front of a packed arena of about 8,000 people to recite 'The Hotshot's Prayer.'

The prayer, which was written for all Hotshot crews across the U.S., references the dangers the firefighters take when tackling fires in their early stages.

The Hotshot's Prayer: Brendan McDonough, the sole-survivor of the June 30 incident that killed the other 19 members of his crew, recited a special prayer at the Tuesday memorial

Moved: Biden said he felt a connection with the lost men due to the firefighters who once 'saved my life.'

Scout: McDonough survived the fire because he was acting as the crew's lookout. He warned them of the changing weather, but the men just couldn't get out in time

Packed: Tim's Toyota Center in Prescott, Arizona was filled with those who came to honor the departed  

'When I am called to duty, Lord to fight the roaring blaze, please keep me safe and strong, I may be here for days.'

The prayer also speaks to the constant possibility of death.

'For if this day on the line I should answer death's call, Lord, bless my hotshot crew, my family, one and all.'

At the end of his recitation, McDonough's voice broke as he thanked the massive crowd gathered.

'I miss my brothers,' he said.

The
memorial on Tuesday was the last of a series of vigils since the 
firefighters' tragic death on June 30, battling an out of control 
wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona.

Family
members and politicians alike came together to honor the lives of the 
nineteen firefighters whose lives were taken in the fire.

Grieving: McDonough is embraced by Prescott, Arizona Mayor Marlin Kuykendall, while Gov Jan Brewer looks on

When I am called to duty, Lord ...To fight the roaring blaze ...Please keep me safe and strong ...I may be here for days.Be with my fellow crew members ...As we hike up to the top.Help us cut enough line ...For this blaze to stop.Let my skills and hands ...Be firm and quick.Let me find those safety zones ...As we hit and lick.For if this day on the line ...I should answer death's call ...Lord, bless my hot shot Crew ...My family, one and all.

McDonough was the lone survivor of his team, because he was assigned to keep watch of the blaze.

When McDonough saw that the winds were changing and driving the flames to wrap around his team, he warned the crew.

Unfortunately they weren't able to escape fast enough.

As a last resort, the 19 firefighters retreated to make-shift shelters. All 19 perished in what was  the largest loss of firefighters battling a wildfire in 80 years, and the most killed in a single incident since 9/11.

The Granite Hotshots were an elite unit of firefighters dispatched to battle wildfire's in their early stages. There are other Hotshot teams, mostly in the Western U.S., totaling about 110 men in teams of 20.

At the service, each individual firefighter was honored and their family given an American flag. Memorials were set up to honor each of the fallen. Inside the arena images of each Hotshot killed were hung with their uniforms, helmets, boots and single white rose next to each image.

Outside the arena another tribute was set up with pictures of the fallen, each with an American flag of their own and purple ribbon with his name. A granite marker read: 'In honor and recognition of all wildland firefighters across this great nation. Duty - Respect - Integrity.'

Speakers at the event included Vice President Joe Biden and Arizona Gov Jan Brewer.

Against the backdrop of the departed's pictures, Gov
Brewer talked about the great pride she had in the men who lost their lives.

'Of course our hearts are filled with profound sadness today, but they're also filled with great pride,' Brewer said. 'How wonderful is it to know that Arizona was home to 19 men like those we honor today.'

She praised the men as heroes who tragically died before their time.

'They
were protectors defending out communities, safeguarding our friends, 
family and strangers alike. They were 19 heroes gone at the turn of the 
wind,' she said.

Team: The Granite Hotshots were just one unit of many Hotshot crews that battle fires in their early stages across the U.S. Other hotshots came out to attend the Tuesday memorial

Firefighter legacy: Los Angeles County Fire Captain. Joe Woyjeck and his wife receive a flag for their lost son Kevin Woyjeck, a member of the hotshot team

Remembered: Each firefighter's picture was displayed as well as their uniforms, helmets and boots

Musical salute: Bagpipers played a tribute to the fallen men

Console: Two unidentified women embrace at the ceremony

Roses: A single white rose was placed next to each of the fallen firefighter's pictures

Vice President Biden spoke at the 
event because he felt a bond with the men due to previous experience 
with firefighters who 'saved my life.'

Biden
was referencing several incidents where firefighters stepped in to aide
his family. First, in the 1972 car crash that killed his wife and 
daughter. His two sons were also in the car but survived because 
firefighters stepped in to break open the vehicle.

'I
don't have the privilege of knowing any of these heroes personally, but
I know them,' Biden said. 'I know them because they saved the lives of 
my two sons.'

Biden also 
talked about how firefighters took him to the hospital when he suffered 
an aneurysm in 1998, and how firefighters saved his wife Jill when 
lightning struck their home. 

McDonough
shook hands with the president who called his fellow Hotshots 'men of 
uncommon valor' while thanking God that one crew member got out alive. 'These
men were some of the strongest most disciplined, tenacious, physically 
fit men in the world. An elite unit in every sense of that phrase,' 
Biden said.

"There's an old saying: All men are created equal, and then a few became firefighters," Biden said. "Thank God for you all."

To the families of the fallen, Biden spoke about the heroism their sons, husbands and brothers showed in the face of danger.

'The 19 
who fell were not only heroes on Sunday June 30, 2013, to you the 
families. They were heroes long before we knew their names.'

Other
attendees at the event included Homeland Security Secretary and former 
Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano, Interior Secretary Sally Jewel, 
Senator John and Cindy McCain, Senator Jeff Flake and Representative 
Paul Gosar.

Individual funerals for the men will begin later in the week.
