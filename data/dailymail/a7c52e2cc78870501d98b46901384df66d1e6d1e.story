The ex-boyfriend of a young mother-of-two has today being charged with murder after she was strangled and her body was dumped in a caravan.

Jade Watson, 22, was found dead when paramedics were called to a property in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on Monday evening.

Miss Watson, who worked in a fish and chip shop in Bradford, has two children Jacob, four, and two-year-old Ella.

children’s father Daniel Tonge, 28, is said to be ‘distraught’ their 
mother has been killed and is dreading telling the toddlers of her 
death.

Daniel’s brother John
Tonge, 35, laid flowers outside the scene yesterday and said: 'I’ve 
known Jade for about eight years, she was a lovely lass and a great mum.

'Daniel
and Jade were together for five years and had two lovely kids together,
who they both adore. Jade’s mum is looking after them at the moment.

'James
Gray is Jade’s on-off ex-boyfriend. I don’t know what she was doing at 
his house and what happened there, I only know she has ended up dead and
James was arrested.'

Mr Tonge said his brother is devastated.

'Daniel
is very quiet, he is in shock and knows he is going to have to tell 
Jacob and Ella their mum is not here anymore,' said Mr Tonge.

'I’m distraught myself and cannot believe this has happened.'
