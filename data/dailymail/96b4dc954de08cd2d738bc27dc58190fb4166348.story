A man is battling to overcome his bizarre fear of ketchup which has stopped him enjoying normal meals for his whole life.

Lee Sentino, 24, has a physical reaction to all types of sauce or condiment, and refuses to eat any 'wet foods'.

The barman from Manchester says he starts gagging, feels sick and breaks out in a cold sweat when he is confronted with ketchup, gravy, custard or HP Sauce.

Fear: Lee Sentino pictured eating dry pasta because he is terrified of all sauces and condiments

He does not remember when the crippling phobia started, but whenever he was growing up he had to be given special dry meals by his family.

'I don't really know why I had this phobia but I used to joke that my mum chased me around the house with a bottle of Heinz ketchup,' Mr Sentino said.

'I would eat like everyone else however my food has to be dry. If my family were having lasagne, I would have a separate meal.

'I could eat a good old-fashioned roast dinner, but I had to eat it without gravy.

'When presented with something I didn't want to eat it I would gag and feel as if my body would reject it if I were to consume whatever it was.'

Mr Sentino has lived with the fear for more than decades, but has become increasingly embarrassed by having to make a fuss whenever he ate in public.

'I never seen any counsellors about the issue because I presumed it would be fine to live like this forever,' he said.

'I've had a fair number of comments about it from people over the years and this only served to heighten my anxiety about it.

Terrifying? Surprisingly many people claim to be scared of ketchup, such as spin doctor Alastair Campbell

'It has been difficult to go to restaurants as most, if not all, of the menus wouldn't be suited to my needs.

'I remember the time I went to an Italian restaurant and just asked for a bowl of pasta. When I close my eyes, I still see the woman's look of confusion and disgust.'

In the past year, Mr Sentino has become to fight back against his phobia, and has begun to eat food such as pies and some puddings.

'The thought of gloopy bottled sauces like ketchup and brown sauce still make me feel queasy, similarly custard is too much for me - I would rather just steer clear,' he said.

While the fear of ketchup will strike many people as inexplicable, there are in fact many people who claim to have an uncontrollable revulsion to the sauce.

One of the celebrity sufferers is former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who recently revealed that a mild fear of ketchup is called 'saltomaphobia' while an extreme reaction is 'equusmortusphobia'.
