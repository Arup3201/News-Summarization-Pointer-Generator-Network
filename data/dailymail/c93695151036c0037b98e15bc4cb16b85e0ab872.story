A woman who soared to 19 stone after being bullied at school for having a gay mother has shed almost half of her body weight and is now looking for love.

Christine Roberts, from Telford, Shropshire, began comforting eating after her parents split up and her mother announced that she was a lesbian.

Weighing 19 stone at her heaviest, Miss Roberts was bullied because of her mother Sue’s sexuality.

'Kids at school said I was gay because she was,' said 23-year-old Miss Roberts, who is now eight stone lighter.

'I knew it wasn’t her fault, it’s just how she was. They would cyber-bully me using a fake profile of me to tell other girls from school that I was in love with them. It was really hard.'

The bullying caused Miss Roberts to reach for the biscuits and by age 16, she was size 26.

Aged six, Miss Roberts’ parents split and her and her sister, Lisa,  who is now 20, stayed with their mother, now 54.

However, the Marks and Spencer supervisor said back then she did not understand what had happened.

She said: 'We went and stayed with mum’s ‘friend’ then. But it was actually her girlfriend.

'It wasn’t until I was ten that I fully understood what was happening.'

When children at school discovered her mother was a lesbian, Miss Roberts said bullies used it to pick on her and she found comfort in food.

'I’d eat three packets of biscuits in one go while I was doing my coursework - I just couldn’t stop,' said the 23-year-old.

'Then I’d nip out and buy packets of sweets.

'At home I’d have huge portions at dinner and make out I hadn’t eaten all day.'

By the time she was 16, Miss Roberts weighed more than 19 stone.

'It was a non-stop cycle. I’d eat because I was miserable, then feel guilty and eat more to try to feel better.'

Miss Roberts would eat several packets of biscuits a day and regularly have takeaways with friends.

She said: 'We’d get a Chinese or have a greasy pizza together.

'But they weren’t getting fat because they would only have two slices. 'I ate half the pizza by myself.'

When Miss Roberts turned 18, she became even more self conscious.

'I’d organise nights out with friends then cancel because I felt so uncomfortable,' she said.

'On the rare times I did go out, I felt like I was getting funny looks.

'I wouldn’t go to the bar on my own.

'I’d just sit down all night.

'I’d had so many men shout out "oi fatty" in the street. I’d never been in a relationship and I never thought I’d find a man.'

After getting a retail job in HMV that year, 2009, Miss Roberts lost two stone from being active at work.

She said: 'I was walking around all day and it just happened naturally. It made me think I could change.'

In September 2012, Miss Roberts and her sister decided to move hundreds of miles from their home in London to Telford, Shropshire.

'I decided it could be a brand new start in every way,' she said.

'We moved in December so we decided for our New Year’s resolution we’d both get into shape.

'Although my sister was a healthy weight anyway, it really spurred me on.'

So in January 2013, Miss Roberts joined up to the Dukan Diet.

'I’d seen it online while looking for different diets - people said the results were so quick,' she said.

For the first ten days, Miss Roberts ate nothing but protein. She had two poached eggs for breakfast, Quorn chicken fillets for lunch and chicken breast with egg white for dinner.

She said: 'I lost 13lbs in that first week and it felt amazing.'

During the second phase, she could also eat non-starchy vegetables on alternate days.

Christine said she is hoping that now she has lost weight, she will find true love

After losing four stone in six weeks, Miss Roberts could reintroduce other foods but had to have a protein-only day once a week.

Miss Roberts also burned calories by doing cardio at the gym three or four times a week, followed by a 30-minute swim.

She is now 10st 7lbs, a size 12, and her confidence has soared. Miss Roberts said: 'This diet has been life-changing.

'I’ve changed my hair colour and have lots of new friends. Now I go out on a weekend and I’m first on the dancefloor, not sat in the dark corner anymore.

'I get chatted up at the bar and love it. I’ve been on plenty of dates and it’s great to know men find me attractive. You’ve got to love yourself before anyone else can love you. I hope I’ll find "the one" now.

'I’m never going back. It really is a lifestyle change.'
