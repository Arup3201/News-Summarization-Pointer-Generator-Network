Troubled former swimming star Grant Hackett has been photographed half-naked and panicked in the foyer of Crown Casino in Melbourne.

Pictures have emerged of Hackett, shirtless and barefoot as he desperately searches for his missing four-year-old son.

A witness told the Herald Sun the former Olympic champion was in the foyer of the Casino, asking if anyone had seen his son Jagger.

Jagger had gone missing from the hotel room the family was staying in. He was later found safe and well by Crown Security within the casino complex, according to reports.

It is unclear where exactly Jagger was found, but it is understood he was not on the gaming room floor or on any licensed premises.

Hackett reportedly awoke in the early hours of Saturday morning when he realised his son had disappeared.

According to reports, Hackett was unable to locate the child in the room or the nearby corridors and ran into the foyer half-dressed asking for help.

Hackett, who lives in Sydney, picked up Jagger and his twin sister Charlize and took them to Crown, where he regularly stays when in Melbourne.

The former Olympic freestyle champion lives in Sydney following a nasty divorce with the twinsâ€™ mother, Candice Alley.

The marriage ended in 2012, with Hackett later admiting in an interview he was rliant on Stillnox sleeping pills towards the end of his swimming career.

Hackett also made headlines back in October, 2011 when he trashed the penthouse apartment he was staying in after Derby Day celebrations.

Crown Casino has been contacted for comment.
