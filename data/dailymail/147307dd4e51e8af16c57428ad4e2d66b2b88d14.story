From Warwick University's rowers to Nigel Farage's mother, stripping off for naked charity calendar has become something of a British Christmas tradition.

Now rugby stars from Division One team Ealing Trailfinders have stripped off in a bid to raise money for the Jack Fishwick Discretionary Fund.

Like the now notorious Stade Francais calendar, the photos feature plenty of oiled abs and biceps, although unlike in the French version, local footballers were not invited to join in.

Helping out: Fullback James Love, dubbed 'the Blonde Bombshell', is among the players to appear 

According to fullback James Love, 27, who has been dubbed 'the Blonde Bombshell' by his teammates, all the players were keen to get involved. 

'The boys were all hoping to be involved and had their fingers crossed that they would get to be in the shoot,' he told MailOnline.

'In March, a good friend of the club and former player Jack Fishwick had a life changing injury on the field and is now quadriplegic.

'The boys decided to produce this calendar to raise money towards his rehabilitation and recovery, so it is a great cause.'

Happily for Mr Love and his fellow players, stripping off in front of one another proved trouble free and all appeared to enjoy the experience.

'Being rugby players, it's not unusual for the boys to be naked in front of each other,' he said. 'Being in front of the camera did separate the men from the boys though.

'Some of the boys milked it but others not so much. All in all, it was enjoyable day with lots of laughs, baby oil and some horrific blue steels.'

Proceeds from the calendar will go to support the ongoing care required by Mr Fishwick, who was injured in a rugby accident in March.

According to the club, Mr Fishwick, 27, who played for Ealing Trailfinders between 2010 and 2013, is fighting hard but has a long road to recovery ahead. 

'So far the calendar has been received very well,' added a delighted Mr Love. 'The photos and the overall design are really professional and the lads are happy with how the shots came out.'
