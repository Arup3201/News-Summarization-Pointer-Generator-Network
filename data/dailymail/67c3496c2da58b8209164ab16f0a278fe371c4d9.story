Scarred: A month after the attack, Mr Griffin's scar is healing and he is able to eat solid foods again

A diver says he is lucky to be alive after being attacked by a six-foot conger eel 25 metres below the surface.

Jimmy Griffin from Galway was attacked by the giant eel while diving off the coast of Connemara.

The 48-year old, who is the owner of the famous Griffin’s Bakery in Galway city, suffered a severe bite to the face when undertaking his first dive in two years last month.

He had to undergo surgery for two and a half hours and is grateful to plastic surgeon Padraig Regan for helping him.

A vastly experienced diver with over 200 dives completed in his 20-year diving career, Mr Griffin was left stunned when he was blind-sided by the eel 25 metres below the surface.

'I didn’t see it until it had attacked me. It was an awful shock and I had to wrestle it off my face,' he said.

“It managed to knock my regulator out of my mouth during the attack, so the first think I had to do was get that back and keep it calm. Thankfully I managed to keep myself under control.'

First instincts when under attack at that depth must be to immediately return to the surface, but Mr Griffin was thankful that his vast training kicked in instead.

'I knew I had to remain calm, that was the most important thing. I returned to the surface gradually to avoid the bends and I managed to get back into the boat.

'I knew by a few of the people that were on the dive with me that it was a pretty bad bite.

'To complicate things I had driven my young daughter and my Polish mother-in-law out to the beach for the day so I had to make plans to take care of them, but once I knew I was going to Galway hospital I knew things would be okay,' he said.

His wife Bogna and his teenage son were holidaying in Poland but rushed home when the incident happened.

The award-winning baker had to survive on baby food for several days because his mouth was so sore.

'My mouth was torn apart inside and it has been extremely tight. It has been a slow recovery.

Unusual: The unprecedented attack is not in keeping with Conger eels' behaviour. Mr Griffin has both internal and external stitches (left) on his cheek to tighten the skin around his mouth

'I have a huge amount of internal stitches as well as external stitches,' he added.

After being subject to such a strange occurrence, Mr Griffin began to look into the history of attacks by Conger eels and he says he is yet to find a precedence.

'They are usually afraid of humans and shy away from life. They usually stay in their holes and come out during the night. We think this one must have been blind or something to attack me like that.

'I’ve had a good look online and I cannot find any other incident of someone being attacked by a Conger eel. And the fact that it happened in open water means it really was a freak incident.

'But it won’t put me off. I won’t hesitate in going diving again. It’s funny, it was two years since my last dive and for that to happen is strange. But I’ll give it a go again at some stage I’m sure,' he said.
