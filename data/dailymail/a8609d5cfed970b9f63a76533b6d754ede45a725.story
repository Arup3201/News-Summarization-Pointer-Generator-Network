Navarrete-Gonzalez is expected to survive but when he is released he will be placed in custody under suspicion he murdered his son.

Police say when they arrived at the home they found the child in bed covered in stab wounds, reports NBC.

Police say Navarrete-Gonzalez called police to tell them his son was dead but did not mention how he died.

'That was all he said,' said Darin Schindler of the Ventura Police Department of the call.

Ventura police told the Ventura County Star that Navarrete-Gonzalez shared a three or four bedroom home with several families and that the child's mother lives at a different address.

The mother was not present at the time of the stabbing. 

The eight to ten residents who resided in the home were unaware that anything had happened until police arrived.

The crime allegedly occurred in the father's room and he was the last one to see the victim before he died.

Neighbour Gill Surmont said she knows several of her neighbors but didn’t know anyone in that home.

'It’s just really sad,' she told The Ventura County Star, tears streaming down her face.
