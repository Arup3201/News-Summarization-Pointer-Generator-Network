A police officer today accidentally revealed plans to seize Julian Assange 'under all circumstances' if he steps outside the Ecuadorian embassy.

The document - headed 'Restricted' and 'Decisions - Supporting Rationale' was carried by the officer and made clear their determination to arrest the WikiLeaks founder should he leave the building in central London.

The top-secret paperwork, captured by Press Association photographer Lewis Whyld, was recorded at a briefing and appears to order police to make the arrest if Mr Assange attempts to leave in a diplomatic bag or vehicle.

It suggests he should be arrested if he emerges from the embassy 
either with a 'dip' (diplomat), in a 'dip' car, or even if he is 
smuggled out in a 'dip' bag.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The 
document is one officer's notes from a briefing. Our objective is to 
arrest Julian Assange for breach of bail. Under no circumstances would 
any arrest be made which was in breach of diplomatic immunity.'

Mr Assange, who has been in the building for two months, is wanted for questioning in Sweden over claims of sexual assault.

He is refusing to travel to 
Scandinavia amid fears he will be extradited to the United States over 
his controversial website.

Ecuador granted the Australian political 
asylum last week.

The UK government has made it clear 
Mr Assange, who denies the allegations, will be arrested if he steps 
outside the embassy after jumping bail.

Ambassadors from several South American countries went to the embassy today.

An embassy spokesman said: 'This 
display of support for the Ecuadorian Government by South American 
ambassadors is a clear indication of the level of support Ecuador has 
amongst countries in America and a clear statement opposing the UK 
Government's threats against the integrity and sovereignty of its 
embassy in London.'

The British Government has 
threatened, under a 1987 Act, to enter the embassy and arrest the 
41-year-old, but Foreign Secretary William Hague has said there is no 
intention to 'storm' the building.

At a briefing inside the Ecuadorian 
residence, an official said: 'The best thing to do is for the Government
 to withdraw the threat.

'The
 Foreign Office has been contacting many South American countries in the
 past week indicating they wanted to open conversations again with the 
Ecuador government - but they have made no approach.'

The
 official said withdrawing the threat to enter the embassy was not a 
condition of talks being held, but it would be an 'indication of good 
faith'.

Ecuador's president has said the 
diplomatic row 'could be ended tomorrow' if Britain gave the activist 
safe passage to South America.

Rafael Correa said: 'This could end 
tomorrow if the UK grants safe passage, or it could go on for months and
 years if Mr Assange can't leave the embassy of Ecuador in London.'

The daily cost for the round-the-clock police guard of the embassy is £50,000 charged to the UK taxpayer each day Mr Assange remains in the Ecuadorian Embassy

The Foreign Office confirmed 'formal 
communication' had been sent to diplomats from the South American 
country which granted the Australian political asylum last week, but 
would not reveal the contents.

Ecuador yesterday expressed 
optimism that a 'compromise' could be reached with the UK and called for
 fresh talks over Mr Assange’s future.

The South American country has insisted that Mr Assange can stay at their embassy there for 'as long as it takes' to resolve his future.

'He can stay here for eight years... two centuries.

'However long he wants,' said one diplomat.
