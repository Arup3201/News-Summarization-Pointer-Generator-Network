A former girlfriend testified Tuesday that an Army soldier on trial for murder told her to expect 'a lot of money' just hours before his pregnant wife was suffocated to death during a sex game — leaving him to collect $500,000 in insurance and benefit payments.

A military judge heard a second day of witness testimony in the court-martial of 22-year-old Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, who faces an automatic life sentence if convicted of killing his wife, Sgt. Deirdre Aguigui, at their apartment on Fort Stewart July 17, 2011.

He is also charged with causing the death of their unborn child.

Samantha Thacker said she met Aguigui in 2010 as he spent the summer training in Arizona. She said they had already started a romance by the time she learned he was married, but said he promised her a divorce was pending.

Thacker said they were still in close touch a year later, and on the day Aguigui's wife died, he had sent her text messages.

'One of them said he was coming into a lot of money and I would never have to work,' Thacker said on the witness stand. She said when she later learned Aguigui's wife was dead, he said if she was killed in a car crash.

Prosecutors say Aguigui's rocky marriage and the hefty insurance payout prompted him to kill his wife, who was about seven months pregnant.

A former Army buddy testified Monday that Aguigui told him that he handcuffed his wife during sex and suffocated her by putting a plastic bag over her head.

Aguigui has pleaded not guilty. Under questioning by his defense attorneys, Thacker noted Aguigui's text message didn't specifically mention his wife or insurance money.

Army investigators say Aguigui told them he had woken up from a nap to find his wife dead on the couch. Paramedics found marks on her wrists, but no other obvious wounds.

Military police found a pair of handcuffs on the couple's bed, along with a number of other sex toys scattered around the room.

Aguigui told them he had cuffed his wife during consensual sex earlier in the evening, before he nodded off for a nap, said Justin Kapinus, the Army's lead investigator on the case.

'He stated that she enjoyed being tied up and that night they used the handcuffs,' Kapinus said. 'He said she enjoyed having her hands behind her back and laying on the handcuffs.'

Aguigui is already serving a sentence of life without parole in a Georgia state prison after he pleaded guilty last year in a double slaying that occurred nearly five months after his wife's death.

Civilian prosecutors say he used the $500,000 in insurance money to buy guns and bomb-making parts for an anti-government militia group called F.E.A.R. (short for Forever Enduring Always Ready) that Aguigui formed by recruiting disgruntled soldiers.

Civilian authorities say Aguigui ordered the deaths of former soldier Michael Roark and his girlfriend, Tiffany York, in December 2011 to protect the group and its plans.

F.E.A.R members had stockpiled assault weapons and bomb components and discussed plotting attacks on a crowded landmark in nearby Savannah, poisoning the apple crop in Washington State and even assassinating President Barack Obama.

Aguigui and three other soldiers were jailed about a week after Roark and York were shot to death in rural Long County near Fort Stewart. More than a year passed before the Army charged Aguigui in his wife's death in April 2013.

Pfc. Michael Burnett has also pleaded guilty in the deaths of Roark and York. The two soldiers accused of firing the killing shots — Pvt. Christopher Salmon and Pfc. Michael Burnett — are still awaiting trial.

Friends of the Army couple testified during a pre-trial hearing last week about constant fighting in their marriage over Aguigui's drug use and infidelities by both husband and wife.

Deirdre Aguigui, 24, was about seven months pregnant when she died, and friends said her husband had questioned whether the child was his.

Isaac Aguigui called 911 on the evening of July 17, 2011, saying he found his wife unconscious and unresponsive on the couch, with chunks of a potato she'd eaten for dinner in her mouth, Kapinus said.

When she died, Deirdre Aguigui had small cuts and abrasions on her wrists and investigators found a pair of handcuffs on the bed, according to the Army criminal investigator.

The bed was also covered with sex toys, leg restraints and other paraphernalia. The investigator said Isaac Aguigui told investigators he and his wife had used the handcuffs and other items during sex a few hours earlier. Kapinus said he suspects the bedroom scene was staged.

He said, 'It seemed excessive.'

Aguigui's friend Michael Schaefer testified that Aguigui at first told him his wife died from a blood clot.About a month later, after they had been up all night using cocaine, they got into an argument.Schaefer said he asked his friend point-blank what really happened to his wife.

'He told me he had strangled her with a bag,' Schaefer said. 'He handcuffed her, put a bag over her head and strangled her' while also sexually assaulting her.

An autopsy failed to reveal whether an attack, illness or some other cause killed a pregnant Army soldier whose husband is charged with killing her, a military medical examiner testified Tuesday.

Two days after Mrs Aguigui died, an autopsy conducted at the southeast Georgia Army post found bruises on her wrists, arms, head and back, as well as bruising inside her mouth.

But there was nothing to indicate what caused most of the injuries and none were fatal, said Lt. Cmdr. Lisa Rivera, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy.

Rivera found no tell-tale signs of illness, allergies or toxins. She even ruled out rare disorders linked to pregnancy such as bubbles in the blood and infections of the uterus.

Rivera's testimony sets up a case of dueling expert opinions that could prove be key to the trial, which will be decided by a military judge instead of a jury. Prosecutors charged Isaac Aguigui with murdering his wife last year after a Georgia state medical examiner offered a second opinion and concluded his wife died from asphyxiation while being choked or smothered.

Dr. James Downs was scheduled to testify later.

‘In my opinion, while there are a constellation of blunt force injuries, I did not find definitive evidence of asphyxia in this case or any other cause of anatomic death,’ said Rivera, who insisted she couldn't even determine if the woman was killed or died from natural causes.
