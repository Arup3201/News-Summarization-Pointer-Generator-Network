Could Saturday Night Live be coming to an end? 

The popular sketch comedy program is in its 40th season this year, and ahead of the show's highly anticipated special on February 15 to mark the occasion, creator Lorne Michaels is sharing who his favorite cast members have been, the A-list actors who auditioned for roles and he turned down and what the future holds for his show.

This as he suggests that when he steps down from his post, it may be the end for the show.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Michaels, who started the show when he was just 30-years-old, was asked what would happen when he left, and said; 'I don't know. I'm going to keep doing it as long as I possibly can because I love it and because it's what I do.' 

He then added; 'But there is more niche stuff [now]. Us doing Update and giving it 10 minutes in a 90-minute show was a big deal, but Comedy Central and Jon Stewart, none of that existed then. So things have fragmented.' 

Then he did something he seldom does in interviews, and revealed some of the young talent he passed on who would go on to become huge stars.

'Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell There were lots of people who you'd see how brilliant they were, but you knew on some level that it wasn't going to work.'

The same goes for Lisa Kudrow, who he said came at a time where there were already two similar women on the program, Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks.

There is one star whoever who seems so perfect for the show, it is almost unfathomable that they passed. 

'I wasn't at the Jim Carey audition, but somebody who was there said, 'I don't think Lorne would like it,' and they were probably wrong, but it doesn't matter.,' explained Michaels.

'Or maybe they were right — who knows? No one gets it all right.'

Among the A-list stars who auditioned and were not cast on the show are Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell (above)

As for his favorite cast members, it seems that Michaels has a big soft spot for Kristen Wiig and Will Ferrell, especially after the two returned to the show even after finding success in movies. 

This only helps the show he explained, but also endears them to their fans.

'They also have a pact with the people who watch the show: They were there, they loved you at the beginning, they told everyone else about you and they showed up for everything you did,' he explained.

'So you have to make sure that you honor that.'

And if Michaels does step down soon, there is one name almost everyone has talked about running the show - Tina Fey.

The former head writer for the show, who still turns up at least once a season, has been asked about this in the past, and said; 'I feel like Saturday Night Live is so defined by Lorne's taste and his sensibility. He is the center of that show, and I think it should just — when he wants to stop, it should just stop.'

Michaels has won Emmys and Peabodys for his shows, and created Saturday Night Live when he was just 30

As for the anniversary special, the lineup of past talent that will perform is remarkable, and includes, in addition to Fey, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, Chevy Chase, Jimmy Fallon, Will Ferrell, Martin Short, Tina Fey, Molly Shannon, Mike Myers, Andy Samberg, Bill Murray, Amy Poehler, Dana Carvey, Kristen Wiig, Dan Aykroyd, Chris Rock, Garrett Morris, and Maya Rudolph.

And those are just the former cast members.

Among the former hosts stopping by are; Emma Stone, Derek Jeter, Kanye West, Paul McCartney, Melissa McCarthy, Jerry Seinfeld, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson, Jim Carrey, Peyton Manning, Taylor Swift, Betty White, Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin, Paul Simon, Justin Timberlake, Christopher Walken, and Steve Martin.

And last, but certainly not least, even Sarah Palin herself will be there.
