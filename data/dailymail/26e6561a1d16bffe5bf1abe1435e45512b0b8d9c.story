The best of the Bar? Patrick Hennessey, a former Army officer, has topped a list of the most attractive barristers in Britain

They're used to vying for victory in the courtroom but now Britain's top legal brains have another competition on their hands.

A list of the 21 most attractive male barristers in Britain has become the talk of the Bar following its publication online by two anonymous women who 'love a man in a wig'.

Patrick Hennessey, based at 39 Essex Street chambers, tops the list, with the Oxford-educated former Army officer described as: 'Like Prince Harry but with brains'.

Behind him at number two is Harvard-educated Derrick Dale QC, known as 'a charmer of the old school variety who is more suited to the silver screen than the bar', while the number three spot taken by Nick Wilkinson, a divorce specialist who is dating Prince William's ex-girlfriend Olivia Hunt and is the son of the Court of Appeal's Lady Justice Hallett.

Justin Ageros, number 20 on the list, is said to be 'a manly man - like a fire-fighter stuffed into an M&S suit.'

It's not just the younger men who come out triumphant in the latest battle of the legal egos.

Orlando Pownall, 60, place ninth, is described as: 'a silver fox who has spent his life at the criminal bar fighting the good fight.

'He’s like Victor Lazlo in Casablanca, but with sex appeal.'

For the sake of equality, the list will soon be followed by a compilation of the most attractive female barristers, the founders said.

Mr Hennessey, who served with the Grenadier Guards and published books about his time in Afghanistan, told The Lawyer: 'Most unusually for a barrister, I’m speechless.

Orlando Pownall, 60, makes the top ten, left, while Justin Ageros at number 20 is described as 'a manly man'

'It’s a tremendous honour and very reassuring to know that if the current misconceived and ham-fisted attempts at reform end up breaking the justice system altogether some of us at least have a sporting chance in an even older profession.'

Mr Dale told the Daily Telegraph that he was flattered and had been deluged with emails since the list, entitled Your Barrister Boyfriend, appeared on Tumblr.

Daniel Mount QC, who was ranked as the fifth most attractive barrister, told The Lawyer that he had competition for his wife's gaze from further down the list in the shape of Rory Dunlop.

'I just can’t say how enormously proud I am to have made this list,' he said.

'For any barrister this is the pinnacle. Unfortunately my wife says she prefers number 17.'

The American women behind the site conducted extensive research by poring over photographs of male barristers on their chambers' websites and picking the brains of friends in the know to judge their personalities.

On their Twitter feed @BarristerHottie, they urged people to send in nominations for further additions to the list as well as their own encounters with the top 21.

One of the women, a 31-year-old writer and art historian, told the Telegraph that the list started off because she and her friend fancied dating a barrister.

'Ideally, they are attractive, intelligent, articulate, they can command a room and they ought to be honourable,' she said.

14. Raj Desai of Matrix Chambers

15. Peter Head of 11 Stone Buildings

16. Michael Gration of 4PB chambers

18. Alexander Learmonth of New Square Chambers

19. Joseph Moore of 1 Garden Court

21. Christopher Martin of 2 Bedford Row

'In reality a lot are rather dull, so we thought this was a fun way of finding the nicest ones around.'

Her partner in crime, a journalist using the pseudonym Ivy Williams after the first woman to be called to the Bar, told the newspaper:
 'We didn't want to go for bankers because they come across as rather 
horrible, I'm afraid.'
