He might have been ‘held together by tape’, but that did not stop Greg Rutherford adding the Commonwealth title to his Olympic long jump gold on Wednesday.

This was the one he really wanted, after all; the title that Rutherford felt he needed to silence all those who have unfairly labelled his achievement on ‘Super Saturday’ two years ago as ‘lucky’.

That is why he had been talking about these Games since winning at London 2012 and why he has overcome the ruptured hamstring that nearly forced him to quit athletics, 36 pain-killing injections and a damaged left knee to pursue his dream of winning in Glasgow.

Even on Tuesday Rutherford’s therapist, Andy Burke, had to drive up from London to treat his left hamstring.

‘This is one of the best feelings of my life,’ said Rutherford, who won a silver medal four years ago in Delhi. ‘People are always going to write you off. The Olympics came as a shock to some people, but I had been working so hard for that moment in London.

‘This year I have probably been working beyond hard to make sure that I could win a major title again.

‘I considered quitting at one point with my hamstring, so the fact I have managed to win a major championship is just amazing.’

Even in the minutes before his victory on Wednesday, BBC pundit Michael Johnson’s criticism that Rutherford ‘had a little bit of a chip on his shoulder’ prompted British 200m runner James Ellington to spring to Rutherford’s defence.

Johnson ‘just slates our athletes’, Ellington wrote on Twitter. ‘There’s being honest and being disrespectful.’

But Rutherford’s performance demanded respect last night. His winning distance was 11cm down on his leading jump in London and 31cm less than the new British record he set earlier this year, but the manner of his victory was deeply impressive.

Rutherford really thrived on the crowd’s warm reception in an arena where his great-grandfather, Jock, played football for England 106 years ago. The 27-year-old responded to South African Zarck Visser taking the lead by jumping 8.20m in the third round, earning the right to parade around Hampden Park with a St George’s cross.

It was only the second time Jerusalem has played in this stadium this week, following Dan Greaves’s victory in the F42/44 discus. England needed another gold medal in track and field after winning five silvers on Tuesday night and their Olympic champion — the only one of the ‘Super Saturday’ trio to compete in Glasgow — duly provided it.

However, a heptathlete called Jessica also won a medal as Rutherford triumphed. With Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill missing these championships after giving birth to her son, Reggie, earlier this month, it fell to Jessica Taylor to continue England’s proud tradition in the women’s multi-sport event. The 26-year-old won bronze and set a new personal best of 5,826 points.

Taylor, who is trained by Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s coach Mike Holmes, was third going into the final event, the 800m, and made sure she finished ahead of Jamaican Salcia Slack to clinch the bronze medal behind champion Brianne Theisen-Eaton of Canada.

There was disappointment, however, for Martyn Rooney in the men’s 400m final. The 27-year-old seemed to go off too slowly, leaving himself far too much to do in the final straight as he finished fourth.

Kirani James, 21, added Grenada’s first Commonwealth gold to his Olympic title by beating Iwan Thomas’s 16-year-old Games record with a winning time of 44.24sec.
