A former boyfriend of Calvin Klein who was arrested on Tuesday morning for allegedly stashing cocaine in his underwear and attacking a man wanted to go on a big 'last night out' before attending rehab, it has been revealed.

The 69-year-old fashion designer had reportedly arranged for his troubled on/off lover Nicholas 'Nick' Gruber, 22, to be flown out by private jet to The Meadows clinic in Arizona.

Klein had attended the same facility for his drug problems in 2003 and had arranged to foot the monthly $35,000 bill for his paramour.

He had also arranged to pay for Gruber's private jet transfer, in fear that if the porn star flew commercial he would be tempted to drink alcohol, according to the New York Post.

Klein has also previously paid the rent for Gruber's luxury West Village penthouse apartment for two years and forked out thousands when the model needed plastic surgery after sustaining a skiing injury.

Gruber also suffered from bulimia, which Klein helped him through

The 22-year-old was arrested at his apartment on Tuesday after the big night out, when a 20-year-old victim told police he suffered a cut to the face during an early-morning fight with.

The man told the New York Daily News
 that following the altercation, he considered going home, but decided 
to call the police after seeing blood on his face.

When officers arrived on the scene 
shortly before 5 am, they said Gruber tried to avoid getting handcuffed 
by waving his hands in the air.

Police also observed that Gruber shoved his hand down his pants in what appeared to be an attempt to hide something, sources told the Post. 

According to the New York Post, the model and gay porn star was later strip-searched at the 6th Precinct in Manhattan, where police reportedly found cocaine stashed in his underwear.

Gruber gained notoriety after being seen at social events in the Hamptons and around Manhattan in Klein's company. 

According to multiple reports, the two dated for nearly two years before seemingly growing apart in January.

Klein, 69, has not publicly acknowledged the relationship with the much younger man.
