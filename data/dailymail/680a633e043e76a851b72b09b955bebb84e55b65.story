A top fashion journalist has sharply critiqued the Kardashians' fashion line in her new book, comparing the clothing to cheap Halloween costumes.

In Hijacking the Runway: How Celebrities Are Stealing the Spotlight From Fashion Designers, author Teri Agins recounts a 2013 visit to a Sears store in Yonkers, New York, during which she examined the Kardashian Kollection items on display.

'I rifled through the racks and pulled out a leopard V-neck dress with skinny straps that was a mini in the front and dipped down to floor length in the back,' she writes.

'The print looked rubber-stamped on, and the fabric was full of static and thinner than a negligee; it had the quality of a cheap Halloween costume.'

Ms Agins, a longtime fashion reporter for the Wall Street Journal, adds: 'Even if it had been for a Halloween costume, I would have rejected it as too tacky.'

She also adds that clothing from the line that had looked untouched two weeks before was now surrounded by signs that said '50per cent off.'

Ms Agins writes that the saleswoman told her Kardashian Kollection was a brand that 'typically arrived on the sales floor marked down 50per cent.'

'When I commented that the "sale" price reflected the true value of the shoddy collection, even the saleswoman couldn't disagree,' she continues.

Kim, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian launched Kardashian Kollection at Sears in 2011, featuring clothing, intimate apparel, swimwear, accessories and home goods.

Ms Agins says she had a similarly low opinion of the reality TV stars' offerings when she saw them at a launch event the previous year.

'If I had to grade on a kurve - the fact that Sears offered so little that was appetizing - well, then the Kardashians were C-.'

However, Ms Agins initially had higher hopes for the line.

In a recent interview with Elle, she said she was 'surprised how the Kardashian brand at Sears, which started out with so much promise, just kind of descended into really shoddy merchandise.'

'Apparently it’s still selling. Sears itself is a retailer that’s not that strong, so it’s kind of not surprising,' she added.

'But I remember seeing those clothes at the beginning, and I thought that they looked really, really cute.'
