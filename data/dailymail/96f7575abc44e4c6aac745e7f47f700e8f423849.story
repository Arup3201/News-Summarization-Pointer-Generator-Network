A girl, eight, escaped the horror that came down on her family as a man living with them is accused of killing her father and sister, and critically injuring three other relatives.

The young girl ran to safety hiding behind a trailer  during the shooting that took place on Friday at her family home in Mississippi, according to WJTV.

The father, Jermaine Sims Sr., 31, and daughter Jamiyah Sims, nine, died on Friday morning while in hospital.

The mother, Victoria, 29, their six-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter survived but were in critical condition, said Capt. Clint Earls. Police did not release the children's names.

Jimmy Lyons, 32, lived in the Sims' home and is accused of shooting the family, and faces two counts of murder and three of aggravated assault. He is being held in the Lincoln County jail.

The bloody survivors crossed a usually busy two-lane highway to ask for help, said neighbors who called 911 after waking early Friday to find the mother and two children at their door.

'It was like out of a horror movie,' said Donna Davis, 39. 'I still see that little girl's face in my mind.'

The bloody survivors crossed a usually busy two-lane highway to ask for help, said neighbors who called 911 after waking early Friday to find the mother and two children at their door (above scenes from the shooting at the family home) 

A woman who said she is the grandmother, Ethel Brown, told WJTV that Jamiyah was shot five times in the head.

The mother, who was reportedly shot in the back several times, was taken to Southwest Mississippi Medical Center for treatment.

The two other children who were injured during the shooting are at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, all with gunshot wounds, according to the Clarion-Ledger.

The father's cousin, Ray Sims, said his relatives were helping Lyons by allowing him to live with them in their home.

He said: 'It's hard, we don't have the answers. Right now we're trying to maintain and remain strong.

'You never think this can happen to your family and when it does it just takes you by surprise.' 

Brookhaven Police Chief Bobby Bell, who said  this is the worst shooting he has seen in his 35-year career, also said Lyons has already admitted to the shootings.

He said: 'We have evidence that we have collected from the crime scene to send to the crime lab, and we're going to have to interview the survivors of this situation once they're able to talk to us.'

The shooting reportedly followed an argument between Jermaine Sims and Lyons, but he did not know what the argument was about, according to Capt. Earls.

Earls said there do not appear to have been any other witnesses.

'The only thing we are waiting on is getting some of the victims in well-enough health to where they can shed some light on what caused the incident to erupt,' Earls said.

Police said a call about 12.20a.m. brought police to the neighbors' home, where they found Victoria Sims and two children outside, wounded. 

Inside the Sims' home they found Lyons, who was not injured, and Jermaine Sims and Jamiyah.

Linda Davis, 65, John Davis, 41, and Donna Davis said they did not understand what had happened or who did what at the Sims' house because so many people were talking at once before an ambulance arrived.

The shootings took place in an area about a mile south of downtown Brookhaven: inside city limits but rural in nature, its large yards studded with pine trees.

At one point, Linda Davis (above) said, the six-year-old boy reached up to his face and said, 'Oh, half my ear is gone'

The younger Davises and their 10-year-old daughter, Heaven, live in a white-and-beige trailer home next to Linda Davis' small cream-colored house. 

Both are located across the highway, about 100 yards away from the Sims' brown, wood-frame house.

The Davises said they often saw the children getting on and off the school bus or riding bicycles in the yard, but did not know their neighbors.

Donna Davis said that when she answered her door, someone kept saying, 'We've been hit.' There was so much blood, she said, that she thought they had been hit by a car.

'The little boy, he was half under the porch like he was trying to hide from someone. He was screaming for help,' she said, pointing to the rickety-looking wooden steps leading to the trailer door.

At one point, Linda Davis said, he reached up to his face and said, 'Oh, half my ear is gone.'

John Davis said the boy's wounds included cuts on his face, as if he'd been attacked with a knife.

Donna Davis said that, while they waited for an ambulance, she hugged the girl to keep her warm.

'She kept saying, 'I want my mama,'' Donna Davis said.
