A jilted husband bludgeoned his wife to death with a hammer before stabbing himself 28 times, a coroner has heard.

David Connaughton, 60, killed his wife Julie after researching murder on the internet by typing 'When someone p***** you off, is it worth killing them?' into a search engine website.

A coroner heard Connaughton discovered his wife was planning to divorce him before carrying out the vicious attack, in which he hit her at least 22 times.

David Connaughton, 60, attacked his wife Julie, 57, with a hammer after discovering she was planning to divorce him

He then killed himself with a knife after covering her face with a bag, Chesterfield Coroners Court has heard.

Police officers discovered the couple, who had been married for nine years and both had grown up children from previous relationships, on their bed at their home in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, after Mrs Connaughton's daughter Emily Corless raised the alarm.

Detective Constable Tony Owen said: 'We got a call from Emily Corless saying she was trying to get in touch and couldn't open the bedroom door and was concerned something had happened.

'Officers forced the door which was blocked by a large piece of furniture and found two deceased people in the room.'

A post mortem report stated Mrs Connaughton, 57, had suffered at least 22 blows to her head and had cuts and fractures to her head, hands and arms.

Connaughton, who had worked as a carer, had 28 stab wounds and was found with a knife between his legs.

Mrs Connaughton's daughters Emily and Nicola Corless said their mother was 'kind, caring, loving and bubbly'

The report found he had died hours after Mrs Connaughton and her injuries preceded his and were consistent with defence wounds.

Mrs Connaughton had spoken to solicitors in July 2013 about getting a divorce and the couple had discussed the breakdown of their marriage.

Det. Con. Owen added: 'We knew Julie and David were having marital problems and were almost leading separate lives.

'We were aware she had started a new relationship and, from speaking to family, David had anxiety and was concerned he was losing Julie and would be made homeless.'

The hearing was told that in the weeks leading up to the attack, Mr Connaughton had researched murder online.

Mr Connaughton barricaded himself and his wife in a bedroom at the couple's home in Chesterfield, Derbyshire before the attack

Police checked a computer used by him, which revealed searches for websites about divorce and homelessness - along with two search questions about killing, including: 'When someone p***** you off, is it worth killing them?'

Det. Con. Owen added: 'For some reason he chose that night to go into the bedroom with the knife and the hammer and barricaded the door and attacked Julie before killing himself.'

Police believe Connaughton covered his wife's head with bags from her business, Julie's Fashion House, so he did not have to see her while he was dying.

Assistant coroner Paul McCandless told the hearing that Mrs Connaughton had died from head injuries and her husband from stab wounds and their bodies were found on August 16 last year.

A coroner concluded Mrs Connaughton's death was as a result of an unlawful killing and her husband's death was as a result of suicide

He added: 'The injuries sustained by Mrs Connaughton are so serious and so repeated and so extreme - with clear evidence of her defending herself - it all points to someone having set about her while their intention can only have been to kill her.'

He explained that Connaughton most likely caused his injuries to himself after barricading them both in the bedroom and attacking her while she was either asleep or about to sleep.

Mr McCandless said: 'Due to the degree and overwhelming number of injuries there can be no issue about Mr Connaughton's intent to bring about his death as an extreme and deadly reaction to the crossroads they had reached in their relationship.'

The coroner concluded Mrs Connaughton's death was as a result of an unlawful killing and her husband's death was as a result of suicide.

Mrs Connaughton's heartbroken daughters Emily Corless, 29 and Nicola Corless, 34, said after the hearing: 'Mum was a kind, caring, loving and bubbly person who lived for life.

'We miss her more every day. We thought she would always be around, she didn't deserve any of this.'
