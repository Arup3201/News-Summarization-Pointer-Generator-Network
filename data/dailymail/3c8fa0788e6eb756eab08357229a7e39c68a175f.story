An artist has created a series of gruesome anatomical sculptures stripping family favourite cartoon characters down to their bare bones and internal organs.

American designer Jason Freeny, 43, claims his gruesome versions of the likes of Papa Smurf, Barbie, Hello Kitty and Family Guy star Stewie Griffin, were designed to reveal the inner character of some of the world's most famous fictional faces.

But fans of the sculptures should be prepared to pay a hefty sum if they want to take one home, with most characters costing several thousand pounds on Freeny's Moist Production website.

Intricate: Freeny says his favourite sculptures are the ones with interesting skeletal systems, such as his macabre adaptation of a Barbie doll (right)

Expensive: The sculptures do not come cheap, with some of them on sale for as much as £5,000

Collectable designer pill fobs can be yours for just £5 each but many the one-off sculptures will set you back at least £600, with some going for as much as £5,000.

Freeny said: 'I created these sculptures to discover what these characters look like inside, specifically the grotesque skeletal systems.'

'My favourites are ones that have interesting skeletal systems and I'm hoping to make larger versions of these in the future.'

'It's always great fun designing them because I think it makes the characters feel a lot more life like when they've got a full body rather than being a hollow plastic shell.'

All of the figures are hand made and unique, with many of them are currently on display in New York.

The
 artist, from Silver Spring in Maryland, also designed the Brain Cube 
Puzzle - a handheld game with a skull-bearing twist on the famous 
Rubik's Cube.

Freeny studied Industrial Design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York but began experimenting with anatomical drawings and sculptures while working for MTV

Spending most of the 90's traveling the globe as a muralist and theatrical designer, he joined MTV's Special Events department in 1997 as a freelance designer.

While there, Freeny helped design and create stage sets, props, and custom artwork for MTV Networks live events and trade productions worldwide. His most recognizable contributions were his custom trophies created for MTV's 'Rock-n-Jock' series and 'TRL Awards' televised events.
