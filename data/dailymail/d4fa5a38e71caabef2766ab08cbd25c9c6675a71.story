The Highways Agency is imposing emergency speed limits on pothole-riddled roads rather than repairing them.

Temporary speed limit signs have appeared alongside miles of badly damaged carriageway.

In some places signs and bollards have been there for weeks, but there is no evidence of repair work taking place.

The RAC alerted its patrols to the trend last week after it emerged that miles of the M11  in Essex have been subject to a reduced speed limit because of surface damage.

A RAC spokesman said: ‘This is a first from our point of view. We need to get it stopped.’

Last summer, the Highways Agency, which is responsible for motorways and trunk roads, introduced ‘less prescriptive’ road maintenance contracts.

Responsibility for maintaining major roads is split into 14 areas managed by private firms, and their contracts allow more flexibility in dealing with repairs. But it is feared the move will lead to a lower quality of road maintenance.

Shadow Transport Minister Jim Fitzpatrick said: ‘Reduced speed limits add to congestion and to the frustration of the motoring public, who want to see the roads in a decent state of repair.’

The harsh winter is blamed for causing roads to become especially damaged this year. At the same time, Government departments have been ordered to make cut-backs.

The Highways Agency said last night it had invested £420 million in road improvements last year.  A spokesman added: ‘We have always carried out repairs where they are most needed and we will continue to do this.’

Britain’s councils, who look after smaller roads, are facing a £10.5 billion backlog of pothole repairs after a harsh winter. Local authorities warn that road networks could be ‘brought to their knees’ by more bad weather.

Other roads with stretches subject to long-term restrictions include the westbound A12 in Essex between Ingatestone and Brentwood and the A11 south between Attleborough and Thetford in Norfolk.
