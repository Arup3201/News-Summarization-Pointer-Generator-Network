Artefacts: A half-smoked cigar belonging to Isambard Kingdom Brunel is to go on public display for the first time, along with the case the celebrated British engineer used for his 40-a-day habit

A half-smoked cigar belonging to Isambard Kingdom Brunel is to go on public display for the first time, along with the case the celebrated British engineer used for his 40-a-day habit. 

One of the most ingenious and prolific engineers in history, Brunel oversaw the building of 25 railway lines, more than 100 bridges and three ships - and was rarely seen without a cigar between his lips.

Now his famous cigar case, containing one last half-smoked cigar, will go on show at the new Being Brunel museum, due to open in 2016 at the Brunel-designed ss Great Britain in Bristol. 

Both items are part of a large collection of nearly 1,000 Brunel objects which have been donated to the ss Great Britain Trust by collector Clive Richards, along with Brunel's personalised pen knife and school reports.

They will join more than 14,000 artefacts, including the University of Bristol Brunel Collection and the ss Great Britain Trust Collection, which will go on show at the new £7million museum.

The case, which is stamped I.K.B. Athenaeum Club Pall Mall, reflects Brunel's passion for cigars and fine things.

A member of the Athenaeum since 1830, Brunel wrote of his membership and visits to the club in his diaries.

The case could hold 48 cigars in two separate compartments, along with a small document wallet for stamps and business cards, all of great use for members of the club.

As well as being a personal possession, the cigar case is also a prompt to the famous photograph of Brunel in front of the chains of the ss Great Eastern, smoking a cigar in his muddy trousers and boots, depicting a man of action and determination.

The well-worn penknife is engraved with the initials I.K.B. and was manufactured by George Butler and Co. of Sheffield, around 1840.

It has a horn handle and an array of useful tools such as a tin opener, blade, saw, hook, spike, drill, corkscrew, metal toothpick, tweezers and a device for removing stones from horses' hooves.

Brunel was known for his hands on approach and enterprising nature and would have found the penknife a very useful companion, especially in the days of surveying the route of the Great Western Railway (GWR) on horseback.

Also going on display will be an example of the Thames Tunnel peep show - a memento of a visit to the world famous tunnel, where Brunel was employed alongside his father Sir Marc.

Peep show souvenirs became increasingly popular not only in England but also in the continent, and this highly-decorative example, published in Germany, depicts two scenes within a series of hand coloured concertina lithographs.

On the top is a view of the activity on the Thames while the bottom scenes feature delicate hand cut figures of men, women and carriages travelling through the completed tunnel.

As each panel unfolds the viewer's gaze is invited deep into this engineering marvel, which was to open up a world of opportunities for a young Brunel.

'I have always admired the work that the ss Great Britain Trust does to conserve the ss Great Britain and protect Brunel's legacy,' said Mr Richards.

'Being Brunel will secure the Brunel Collections for the whole nation and I'm proud to be a part of that.'

Mr Richards and his wife Sylvia have also pledged £500,000 to the Being Brunel project to commemorate the engineer who died of a stroke at 53 in 1859, after suffering with kidney problems for several years.

Brunel had launched the ss Great Britain in Bristol in 1843 as the world's first great ocean liner. The iron-hulled steamship was most experimental steam ship of her time and revolutionised travel and set new standards in engineering, reliability and speed.

After being left to rust in the Falkland Islands she was rescued and returned to Bristol in 1970, where she has been painstakingly restored and transformed into a popular tourist attraction.

It will be joined by the new museum in 2016, where visitors can enjoy interactive displays and  experiences such as walking into Brunel's brain, and going back in time to visit the restored Grade II* listed Brunel Drawing Office.

The Heritage Lottery Fund has awarded £4.75 million to the project, while the ss Great Britain Trust has contributed £350,000 towards the £7million target, and is fundraising another £1.4 million.

Matthew Tanner, chief executive of the ss Great Britain Trust, said: 'Being Brunel will engage people of all ages by looking into the mind of a genius who was also a very human and interesting person.

'Clive Richards' magnificent Brunel Collection is particularly rich in telling the human side of the Brunel story, and will inspire visitors to understand him, and be excited by what he achieved, and perhaps what they themselves might be able to achieve too.'

Brunel's famous Clifton Suspension Bridge

Over the course of his relatively short life, from 1806 to 1859, Brunel was responsible for building over 25 railway lines, more than 100 bridges, eight piers and docks, and three enormous steamships.

He was a stand-out even in a field which included greats like George Stevenson - so-called father of the railways - and Thomas Cubitt - who helped build large parts of London, including Finsbury, Islington and Belgravia.

He constructed the Great Western Railway, linking London to Bristol, built the famous Bristol Meads Station, and designed five revolutionary suspension bridges including the Clifton Suspension Bridge over the River Avon.

While he is best known for his work on the railways, he was also an accomplished ship builder.

He built the the 'Great Western', which launched in 1837 and was the first steamship to ferry regular passenger journies across the Atlantic Ocean.

The 'Great Britain', launched in 1843, was the world's first iron-hulled, steam-powered passenger liner to use a screw-propellar, which made it far more efficient.

The 'Great Eastern', launched in 1859, was designed in cooperation with John Scott Russell, and was by far the biggest ship ever built, but was so expensive it drove its owner into bankruptcy.
