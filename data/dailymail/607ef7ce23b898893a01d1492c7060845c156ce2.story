A drugs gang that flooded a county with drugs has been jailed for a total of 167 years after they were found with huge amounts of cash, heroin and cocaine.

In total, 36 people were involved in the gang which operated in Lancashire. Pictures released by police show £200,000 in piles of cash and bags containing £1.5million of the class A drugs.

Lancashire Constabulary carried out a series of arrests where they found bundles of cash including one haul of £51,240 in a Range Rover.

This cash - £51,240 - was taken from a Range Rover that was pulled over in south Lancashire

This Asda bag full of cash worth £51,240 was also taken from the Range Rover. It was made through the sale of a kilo of cocaine

Another £29,920 in cash was recovered from a vehicle driven from Bradford through Greater Manchester on the M60

A kilo of cocaine with a street value of £100,000 was recovered from another house while £18,650 was taken from a van driven by two gang members on the M6.

Another £30,000 was seized from a vehicle on the M60 near Manchester.

The gang operated mostly in the towns of Blackburn and Preston but they also dealt drugs in Cumbria, Merseyside and Cheshire.

A series of trials have taken place over the last 18 months with the final sentencing at Preston Crown Court last week.

During that hearing, Tahier Chand, 34, from Huddersfield, was jailed for five years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin.

Detective superintendent Lee Halstead 
said: 'Operation Oak has dismantled a network of drugs gangs responsible
 for the supply of over £1.5million worth of cocaine and heroin across 
northern England and has resulted in the recovery of huge sums of cash.

'As a result these people, who did 
not have a legitimate income, led comfortable and in some cases quite 
affluent lifestyles, acting as negative role models to young people.

'This was at the expense and misery of
 other residents in the community, whose lives were blighted by the 
effects of drug dealing and associated violence in their neighbourhoods.

'This has been a large scale 
investigation and we have worked closely with officers from our 
neighbouring forces and the Crown Prosecution Service.

'Together, our actions have prevented a
 significantly large amount of drugs from reaching the streets of 
Lancashire helping to make the county a safer place.'

Other defendants included: Suhail Vohra, 32, from Blackburn; Babar Qasam, 34, from Blackburn; Asrer Khan, 29, from Preston; Neil Scarborough, 32, from Preston; Brett McWilliam, 22, from Barrow-in-Furness; Gary Rowlands, 28, from Barrow-in-Furness; Roman Moscicki, 30 from Slough; Rahman Miah, 29, from Bradford and Jonathon Nicholls, 31, from Tarbuck, Liverpool.

Joanne Cunliffe, Crown Advocate from the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit added: 'The fact that 36 individuals have been brought to justice for their involvement in the large scale supply of Class A drugs across the north of England is a testament to the close partnership between the CPS, Lancashire Police, Cumbria Police and other neighbouring forces.

'From the early stages of this investigation, the prosecution team provided guidance and advice to the police and tirelessly worked with them to build a strong case against each defendant.

'As a result we have successfully secured their convictions and dismantled a prominent source of drugs in our region and surrounding areas. The message is clear, we will not tolerate the supply of drugs on our streets and we are wholly committed to prosecuting those responsible.'
