Aston Villa defender Chris Herd has joined Championship side Wigan Athletic on loan until the end of the season. 

The Australian international has not played for the Villans since December 2013 and spent time on loan at Bolton earlier this season. 

He said: 'I'm very happy to sign and get the deal done until the end of the season.

'Everybody has made me feel really welcome and it's been really nice so I'm looking forward to getting out there and playing.

'It's a great club, a Premier League club but unfortunately that's not where the club is at the moment but it's somewhere where it belongs.

'I've played against Wigan a few times; it's always a tough game and it's a great club with great honour.'

Wigan manager Malky Mackay has signed Australian international Herd to bolster his side's defence

Herd hasn't played a competitive game since October but he's raring to go and feels he can bring a lot to Malky Mackay's side.

'I'm a team player and I've been out on loan a few times as a young lad,' he added. 'I'm 25 now so I need to be playing regular first team football and hopefully I can do that here.

'I'm going to bring a lot of energy to the team, I can play in a number of positions and I'll play wherever the manager wants me to play – I can't wait to get out there.'
