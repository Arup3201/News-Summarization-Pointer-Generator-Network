New York is used to being home to the stars, and Frank Lampard and David Villa add football glamour to the city that never sleeps.

Chelsea icon Lampard and former Barcelona star Villa - both Champions League winners - are the two marquee stars for fledgling MLS side New York City FC.

And the Spaniard has wasted no time in meeting his new team-mate, posting a snap with Lampard to his official Instagram account with the message 'With my new @nycfc teammate Frank Lampard!!! Con mi nuevo campanero!!!!'

Villa and Lampard attended the Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night to observe the friendly between Premier League giants Liverpool and Manchester City which Brendan Rodgers' side won on penalities.

The duo will be in action first when the MLS season kicks off early next year, but former Stamford Bridge midfielder Lampard has already spoken about his wish to make an imprint with the new side.

'It's a great vision. I spoke to the people who are leading this and they want to build something special,' he said.

'New York City is an amazing city, the MLS is a great league and it's improving all the time so for me it was just a win-win to come over here and get a different chance, a different league and I want to try and do well.

'They sold a great story to me about how this club's going to be so I can't wait.'
