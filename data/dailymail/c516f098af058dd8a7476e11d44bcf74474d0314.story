Vesta is the second-largest object in the asteroid belt - 320 miles across - and is being probed by a hi-tech robot 'surveyor' that will then move on to its bigger 'sister' asteroid Ceres.

New views sent back by the probe, Dawn, this week, reveal an object more like a planet than an asteroid - and scientists say they now consider it a 'transitional body' between the two.

The Dawn spacecraft has been beaming back images since July - the latest show a rugged surface is unique compared to the solar system’s much smaller and lightweight asteroids.

The latest pictures from Nasa's Dawn probe show that the moon is 'more like a planet' than an asteroid, scientists revealed on Monday

Impact craters dot Vesta’s surface along with grooves, troughs and a variety of minerals.

'Vesta is unlike any other asteroid,' said mission co-scientist 
Vishnu Reddy of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in 
Germany. The new findings were presented at a meeting of the American 
Geophysical Union in San Francisco.

This image using color data obtained by the framing camera aboard NASA's Dawn spacecraft shows Vesta's southern hemisphere in color, centered on the Rheasilvia formation - the different colours reflect different minerals in the surface.

Rheasilvia is an impact basin measured at about 290 miles (467 kilometers) in diameter with a central mound reaching about 14 miles (23 kilometers) high. The black hole in the middle is data that have been omitted due to the angle between the sun, Vesta and the spacecraft.

Most asteroids resemble potatoes, but Vesta is more like an avocado with its iron core, Reddy said.

and the thousands of asteroids

Asteroids are remnants from the birth of the solar system some 4.5 
billion years ago around the same time as the formation of the rocky 
planets including Earth. Studying asteroids can offer clues about how 
our planetary system began.

Instead of returning to the moon, NASA has decided to land astronauts on
a yet-to-be determined asteroid as a stepping stone to Mars.

The mission has yielded a mystery. Before Dawn arrived at Vesta, 
scientists predicted that the surface would harbor a volcano. There’s a 
hill on Vesta, but researchers said there’s no evidence of lava flow or 
volcanic deposits.

Williams said it’s possible the volcanic materials are buried, so the team will keep looking.

Powered by ion propulsion instead of conventional rocket fuel, Dawn will
study Vesta for several more months before cruising to an even bigger 
asteroid, Ceres, where it will arrive in 2015.
