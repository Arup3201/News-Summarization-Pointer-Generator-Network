End of the road: Comedian and actor John Cleese, 74, will not perform any silly walks in Monty Python's reunion shows - because he has a dodgy knee

It sounds like an excuse Basil Fawlty might use... 

John Cleese will not perform any silly walks in Monty Python’s reunion shows – because he has a dodgy knee.

The Ministry of Silly Walks, which was first broadcast on the Flying Circus in 1970, saw Cleese striding in and out of meetings in a series of government-approved walks.

But now aged 74 and having suffered problems with his knee, Cleese can no longer perform the energetic routine.

And confirming the sketch will be absent from the reunion line-up, Michael Palin, 71, said on Monday night during a talk at the National Theatre: ‘John won’t be able to do the silly walks because of his knee.

'When we were doing the show in New York in 1976 he did not want to do the silly walks then as it is very hard work. We have thought about getting a ballet dancer in.’ 

Referring to Cleese’s expensive mulit-million divorce from his third wife, before he married his fourth, Jennifer Wade, 42, in 2012, Palin joked: ‘John has not been able to get his leg over since the alimony.’

Among the well-known acts which will feature in July’s shows are the Spanish Inquisition sketches, known for catchphrases including ‘Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition’.

And there will be clips of late Python Graham Chapman, who died following a cancer battle in 1989.

And Palin also revealed that the ‘fish-slapping dance’ which ends with the comic falling into a lock after Cleese clobbers him on the head with a halibut, will be shown – albeit on television screens.

He said of the sketch, which first appeared in Flying Circus: ‘You will see me hit by a fish but it will be on a large screen unfortunately. We did that sketch in Teddington Lock and I am very proud of that fall.’

No doubt recreating the stunt on stage would have been rather trying for the cast, who have a combined age of 361.

And Palin went on to admit he and his fellow Pythons – Cleese, Terry Gilliam, 73, Terry Jones, 72 and Eric Idle, 71 – have also struggled with the number of costume changes during rehearsals.

Palin said: ‘I am a little bit apprehensive as we have not done anything together for a while and it is going to be a big show, we have dancers and god knows what else.

‘We have got to go off and do costume changes. I have about ten costume changes including one in drag and one as a Spanish cardinal. When you are over 70 they clearly take a bit of time. I am just hoping we can get through it.’

The reunion tour will see the comedy troupe perform a number of dates at London’s O2 Arena in July and marks the first time they will be on stage together in 30 years.

It was announced last November, with tickets selling out in 45 seconds, and comes after several failed attempts to reform by the group.

The Pythons were last seen together in 1983’s The Meaning Of Life and Palin admitted they remain fiercely competitive, as he joked: ‘if anyone does anything individually that fails then we all love that’. But they reportedly realised it was ‘now or never’ to get back together.

Palin said they were also motivated by the money at stake from the 20,000 tickets sold, which cost up to £495 each.

He said: ‘John (Cleese) wanted more money
 for his divorce settlement. I think it is his fourth wife. I have not 
seen him for two weeks, he might be married again.

‘Terry kept going on about his mortgage in Highgate and a guy called Jim Beach, who was the manager of Queen, asked “Why don’t you do the O2, you can make your money back”. And everyone said yes.

‘There was not that much debate. The prospect of making jokes again was never a problem as we all pull together but it was the business and lifestyle that we have differences over. Comedy is a lovely thing to do with the guys. We said yes and now we are stuck with it.’
