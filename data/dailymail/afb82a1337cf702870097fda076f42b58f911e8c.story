Christmas is coming soon, it must be, our Cheryl has just turned on the lights in Oxford Street and all the big budget adverts are on TV. 

John Lewis launched their tear-jerker TV ad about Monty the Penguin this week – and clearly it's worked because the Monty soft toy has already sold out.

The fact that this stuffed Penguin has already flown of the shelves (I do realise that Penguins don't actually fly) got me thinking that you've got to go early to get the must-buy Christmas presents and so this year for the first time ever I'm going to be prepared, and get my pressies sorted before the rush.

Spencer tries out the latest must-have boy's toy, the AirWheel 

And so here is my plan to catch the must-buy gifts this year…

The best boys' toy for Christmas 2014 is without a doubt the AirWheel. This is the present that every gadget-nut will want. 

It's a self balancing electric unicycle and it's going to revolutionise the personal transportation market. 

It has a top speed of 12mph (a pretty swift running pace) and you can go on roads, pavement, sand or dirt tracks and it's easily portable. It's easy to learn how to ride – no harder than riding a bike and I go everywhere on mine.

You can see my riding one in this video below and prices start at £424.99 at www.yesss.co.uk

The self-balancing gadget is said to revolutionise travel 

 

For the lady in your life – you simply cannot go wrong with diamonds. And at fine diamond jeweller vashi.com you can get a classic Diamond Circle Pendant for only £269, or some diamond hoop earrings from £299 – it would cost you four times that in Bond Street. 

Or if you are really putting the boat out you could splash out £2,370 for round cut solitaire 0.95 carat diamond Side Stones Engagement Ring in platinum. But I don't think I'll have need of one of those for quite some time yet.

Spencer has taken advice from his co-star Binky and will opting for lingerie for the lady in his life this year

If you are not quite ready for the expense of precious stones then there is always the option of some opulent boudoir lingerie - I've taken some advice from my Made In Chelsea colleague Binky on this who tells me that Bluebella has a great range with designer styles at high street prices. 

Apparently the Lexi bra and briefs (£30 & £15 respectively at Bluebella.com) are very seductive, but to avoid accusations that this is basically a back-handed present to yourself, try buying some luxurious sleepwear like the Alexandria Chemise (£38 at Bluebella.com) as well.

Every year there's always a few dodgy Christmas sweaters knocking about and if you would rather avoid wearing one, I suggest you leave some heavy hints that any menswear gifts should be bought from theidleman.com – every single garment on this website passes the pub test. 

Spencer recommends the Idle Man's Christmas jumper selection for a tasteful take on the tacky trend 

This is the most important quality control for any young man, which means that even the most festive numbers here would not make you the butt of your mates' jokes down your local watering-hole.

TheIdleMan's Bellfield range of sweaters is the acceptable face of Christmas jumper. Bellfield Asio Jumper With Mountain Jacquard (£40 @ theidleman.com)

For mum's, aunties and wives who are looking to age gracefully, you will be doing them a massive favour by investing in a CACI Microlift. 

Spencer says that the Caci microlift is ideal for mums who want to age gracefully and for an extra special gift there is an Exclusive Swarovksi Crystal version

This home-use beauty gadget firms and tones the face and gets rid of wrinkles. Clearly this has to be given tactfully, carefully stressing that it has been given so that the beautiful matriarchs in your life remain so, and not that they need to use it in the slightest.

CACI Microlift £350 at Harrods.com, and for those with serious wedge there is an Exclusive Swarovksi Crystal version for £760 also at Harrods.com

For dads – why not try to get the old fella to take care of himself a bit more with some male grooming products – like the Lab Series. If he is old school and resistant to moisturizing then cleverly style it as the latest post shave balm. Lab Series Shave Razor Burn Relief Ultra 100ml (£24.65 at escentual.com)

Happy shopping everyone,

Lots of love, Spencer.
