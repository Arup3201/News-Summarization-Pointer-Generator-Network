With her hand resting on her growing baby bump and her face betraying the strain of her impending murder trial, the pregnant US teenager accused of murdering her socialite mother was back in court in Bali today.

Heather Mack, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, negotiated a media scrum as they arrived at for their latest hearing in Denpasar on the Indonesian island.

The pair, both from Chicago in the US, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and stuffing her body in a suitcase. They face a firing squad if they are found guilty.

Seven-months pregnant Heather's baby bump was clearly visible as she sat pensively waiting in the courtroom for proceedings to commence.

Dressed in matching orange prison vests and white shirts, Mack and Schaefer were handcuffed to each other as they arrived at court.

The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of today's appearance 

They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua.

The accused are being tried separately with the same judges and prosecuting teams at the Denpasar District Court.

Prosecutors charged them with premeditated murder, which carries a maximum penalty of death.

The couple's lawyers said last week that the prosecutors' indictment contained inaccuracies that could lead to multiple interpretations of the suspects' activities and the crime scene, raising questions of whether other people had entered the victim's room and killed her.

Lawyers for Mack claim the killing was not premeditated and that she hid in the bathroom while her mother was bludgeoned to death in her hotel room.

They also object to the citing of communications between the defendants on cellphones as evidence of premeditated murder, arguing that cellphone communications are prone to manipulation.

Based on these arguments, they asked the judges to annul the indictment.

But in their response today, state prosecutors told the court that their case is fully qualified according to the law.

'Our indictment as well as charges are very clear,' said chief prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya. 

'Let's prove it through witnesses' testimonies and evidences in the next hearings.'

In their indictment, prosecutors said the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not endorse their relationship and that Mack once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000 before their visit to Bali.

It said that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur.

Schaefer is black, as was Mack's father, James L. Mack, a highly-regarded jazz and classical composer who died in 2006.

Schaefer is accused of battering von Wiese-Mack with the iron grip of a fruit bowl. Security camera footage showed the victim earlier having an argument with him in the hotel lobby.

Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, the indictment said. 

They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did.

Presiding Judge Made Suweda postponed the trial until Monday where the judge panel would decide whether or not to proceed.

Mack will continue to be under medical observation while in Kerobokan Prison because she is pregnant and due to give birth at the beginning of April.

She has pledged to keep her baby daughter with her in prison when she is born, despite sharing a cell with six other female inmates. 

Mack has already named her unborn child Stella after a family member, according to the baby's lawyer, Vanessa Favia. She is due to give birth on April 1. 

Mack is expected to remain behind bars for at least two years while her case proceeds through the Indonesian legal system - assuming she is not freed before then.
