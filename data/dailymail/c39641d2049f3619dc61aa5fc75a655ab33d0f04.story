A reverend has called on Mitt Romney to give up Mormonism because the religion is prejudiced against African-Americans, Native Americans and the Jewish community.

Reverend O'Neal Dozier, who has been a vocal supporter of Rick Santorum, said black voters will never stand behind the former Massachusetts governor because of his beliefs.

The pastor has planned a news conference tomorrow at the Worldwide Christian Center Church in Pompano Beach, Florida.

Reverend Dozier stated: 'The Mormon religion is prejudiced against blacks, Jews and the Native American Indians.

'These allegations are substantiated and validated by the writings of the former prophets and seers of the Mormon church.'

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints banned African-Americans from becoming priests until 1978. Last month, the Church stated: 'We do not tolerate racism in any form.'

If he wins the Republican presidential nomination, Romney will be the first Mormon to run for the White House.

Institution: The Mormon temple in Salt Lake City, Utah is the largest in the church

Reverend Dozier received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Religion and Philosophy from Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida. 

He is also a Vietnam War veteran who played professional football in 1974 for the Chicago Bears. 

The married father of three daughters has also written a book, Who’s On The Lord’s Side Politically - a faith-based guide to political action.
