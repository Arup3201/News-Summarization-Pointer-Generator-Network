Rising numbers of British pupils are attending boarding schools despite inflation-busting rises in fees (posed by models)

Rising numbers of British pupils are attending boarding schools despite inflation-busting rises in fees as parents demand wraparound childcare, it has been revealed.

The majority of boarders are full-time but around one in 13 are ‘flexi’ which means their families pay for overnight stays whenever they need them as they juggle busy working lives.

This short-term measure is most common among younger boarders, with around four in ten having ad hoc sleepovers at school.

The growing popularity in boarding comes even though full fees have reached £9,596 a term or £28,788-a-year - up 4.3 per cent on last year. This rises to as much as £11,168 a term or £33,504 a year in some London boarding schools.

The Independent Schools Council surveyed 1,209 member schools and found a 4.6 per cent increase in UK-based boarders, from 43,919 last year to 45,958. Overall, the proportion of boarders rose by one per cent from 66,585 last year to 67,221.

This brought the total number of ISC boarders across the country to 68,453, taking into account pupils in those independent schools that did not take part in the study last year.

There was a 0.2 per cent fall in day pupils among the schools surveyed in both years, leading to no percentage change in numbers in ISC schools (504,362) compared to last year.

However, the total headcount figure currently stands at 511,928 due to the number of new schools joining the ISC since the survey was carried out last year.

The ISC report reveals that 83.7 per cent of boarding pupils are full boarders; 8.4 per cent are weekly and 7.9 per cent are ‘flexi’. Among seven and 11-year-olds boarders, over 40 per cent are ‘flexi’ boarding.

Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council and former headmaster of Harrow School, said: ‘Although flexi boarding is still the minority of boarders, quite a lot of families find that they don’t want to commit to full-time or even weekly boarding.

‘They prefer their children to board when it suits the family. There’s all sorts of reasons why it could be very attractive to some parents - if one of them has to suddenly go and work abroad for a few days or if there’s a mismatch between different children’s holidays.

‘These flexi boarders tend to be from parents who live near the school, can see the benefits of boarding, they want to continue seeing their children and they prefer a flexible arrangement. They’re basically paying for it daily.’

Referring to the seven to 11-year-old flexi boarders he added: ‘What it reflects is the fact that the older the child becomes, the more confident the parents are about full-time boarding.’

Mr Lenon said that the impact of high boarding fees is ‘significantly ameliorated by the fact that all boarding schools offer quite large numbers of bursaries’.

A night’s occasional boarding typically costs between £25 and £60, according to The Good Schools Guide.

It says that Prior Park College in Bath charges its flexi boarders £45 but levies an £85 fee on any weekly boarder who wishes to spend Sunday evening in school.

Some schools, such as King’s College, Taunton, Somerset, offer day pupils’ one free-night of boarding a week.

The guide adds: ‘Before you rub your hands at the thought of a cheap baby-sitting service we should caution that it excludes weekends, unless the child is involved in a school or house event. ‘

Hilary Moriarty, national director of the Boarding Schools’ Association, added: ‘Yes, it’s an expensive option, and there will be parents who will work very long hours in demanding jobs to be able to make such an education available to their child.

‘But there will also be hard-working parents who find that boarding is an excellent answer to the problems of childcare out of school hours.

‘Older children in particular may find short school days leave them with time on their hands that they cannot use productively. The structured evenings and weekends in boarding schools provide a wealth of opportunity, with facilities and staff on site, to do more than the normal school curriculum and have fun at the same time.’

Meanwhile the report said that over the last two decades there has been a ‘shift towards co-education at ISC schools and a reduction in the number of schools that cater exclusively for either boys or girls’.

The number of single-sex girls schools ‘has not fallen as fast as the number of single sex boys’ schools over this period’, it adds.
