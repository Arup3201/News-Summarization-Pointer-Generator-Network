A call girl has scrapped plans to start up Shetland's first ever escort service on the islands due to a lack of business.

A woman named only as Honey, a 46-year-old Brazilian, is believed to have started offering her services earlier this year in the main port in Lerwick.

She wanted to start a full time business called Magnificent Shetland Escort and charged £180 an hour. But she only had two emails in six months.

Vice: The harbour town of Lerwick in Shetland where Honey is believed to have been offering her services

She said: 'I don't know if I could pay my bills if I stayed. I have a lot of local clients. 

'If they are married, they are worried about putting something in the back of their wives' minds.'

According to Honey, Shetlanders would often travel to Aberdeen, where she is based, because they were worried members of the community might find out. One even travelled to Norway to see her.

Last week she sought to reassure the community about the nature of her work telling The Shetland Times that she is 'a very professional lady'. 

She said: 'I just don't want people to think I'm a drug addict that's come to Shetland or that I'm selling someone else or trafficking girls.'

Honey was visiting the isles around once every three weeks and would normally stay for a long weekend.

Most of her clients were rich oil workers, often from Aberdeen, she said.

The sex worker added that she knew of two local prostitutes on the islands but she was concerned others might arrive in the near future.

Councillor Andrea Manson, 54, was shocked to discover the vice trade had reached Shetland and said such services was an exploitation of women.

Prostitution is not against the law in 
Scotland but loitering or soliciting for sex in public is considered to 
be antisocial behaviour and can warrant an ASBO being issued.
