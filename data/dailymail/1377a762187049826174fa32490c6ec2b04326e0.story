Worrying: Experts hit back at figures showing GP funds have dropped to 8.4 per cent of the budget

Patient care is being put at risk as the amount of NHS budget being spent on general practice is now the lowest on record, experts warn.

Just 8.4 per cent of the service's allowance is put into doctors' surgeries - down from 10.3 per cent in 2005.

This is despite the fact that more than 90 per cent of the service's care is through doctors' surgeries.

It is a worrying change that could have a dramatic impact on waiting times, forcing patients into overcrowded accident and emergency wards, the Royal College of General Practitioners warned.

In a study with the National Association for Patient Participation, the RCGP attacked the leaders of the NHS for sending mixed messages about their priorities.

Polls carried out for the RCGP over the summer found 70 per cent of GPs fear waiting times will worsen over the next two years.

At least 80 per cent said they no longer had resources to provide high-level patient care and 47 per cent said they have had to withdraw some patient services.

Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the RCGP,  said: 'During the last nine years, GPs across the country have had to cope with a growing and an ageing population, in which more and more people have been affected by multiple, serious long-term conditions - and yet funding for general practice has been slashed.

'On the one hand, the people who run the NHS across the UK say they want more people to be cared for in the community. On the other, resources have relentlessly drifted away from community-based health services towards more expensive hospital-based care.

'The flow of funding away from general practice has been contrary to the rhetoric and has happened in the absence of any overall strategy as to how we spend the NHS budget.

'The share of the NHS budget spent on general practice has slumped to the lowest point on record.

Cutting queues: The RCGP claims low funds for general practices will worsen the already crippled A&E queues

'The various NHS bodies and governments who decide how we divide the NHS funding cake in the UK have inadvertently allowed a situation to develop in which funding for general practice is being steadily eroded. With services now at breaking point, it's time to come up with a plan to turn the tide.'

The RCGP and NAPP are launching a new campaign, Put Patients First, Back General Practice, calling on the Government to increase NHS spending on general practice across the UK to 11 per cent by 2017.

They claim the campaign could enable GPs to offer shorter waiting times for appointments, more flexible opening hours and more online services.

Dr Baker said: 'We need to increase our investment in general practice as a matter of urgency, so that we can take the pressure off our hospitals, where medical provision is more expensive, and ensure that more people can receive care where they say they want it - in the community.'
