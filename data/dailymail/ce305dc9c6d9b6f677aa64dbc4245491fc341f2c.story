Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul sent a strong signal Tuesday to 2016-watchers that Benghazi isn't dead as a presidential campaign issue, slamming former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for failing to prevent the 2012 terror attack in the Libyan port city that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other American personnel.

'We have to defend ourselves,' he told a conservative audience at a summit hosted by Heritage Action for America. 'We also have to defend our diplomatic missions around the world.'

'I put a lot of blame at the feet of Hillary Clinton for not defending the embassy – or the consulate – in Benghazi. I think she did a terrible job. And I think that it's inexcusable, basically, when you're asked for security that you not provide it.'

Paul added in a calculated barb at Clinton, who is the Democratic Party's presumptive 2016 front-runner, that protecting American assets 'is the job of the Commander-in-Chief, and that is the job of the executive branch.'

HILLARY'S WAR: Sen. Rand Paul has said that if he had been president when the Benghazi terror attack occurred, he would have removed then-Secretary Clinton from her post

The Benghazi attack, a carefully planned paramilitary assault on America's diplomatic compound and a nearby CIA annex facility, came on the 11th anniversary of the far deadlier 9/11 terror attacks on the U.S. mainland.

Republicans in Congress have never let the issue go, hosting a ricocheting series of Capitol HIll hearings in a handful of different House committees before consolidating their gripes last year into a single investigative panel helmed by South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy.

With Democrats in control of the Senate until last week, however, Congress's upper chamber saw little action on the controversy that bombarded the entire Obama administration, for a time, with unrelenting partisan barba.

Paul and a few other hard-charging GOPers, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have taken every opportunity to be heard on Benghazi, including Tuesday's quick departure into partisan cage-fighting.

Clinton led America's diplomatic corps when the terror attack erupted, and later enraged Republicans by suggesting in Senate testimony that it made little difference whether it was planned or spontaneously erupted.

Her expected White House run could be complicated by unresolved questions related to the scandal. 

Paul's comments came a day before he is scheduled to barnstorm through the early presidential primary state of New Hampshire, making six meet-and-greet stops on Wednesday in the space of eight hours.

On Tuesday the Kentucky senator was answering a question about America's proper role in arbitrating disputes in the Middle East.

'I think that no matter what we do, we have to defend ourselves,' the senator said. 'So printing cartoons – it shouldn't engender people murdering you. So we do have to protect ourselves. France has to defend themselves.'  

Paul is seen as a small-government Republican whose potential presidency would resist the temptation to intervene in global conflicts.

'I don't want to be in the middle of the "long war." he said Tuesday, 'because I don't think there really is an answer in this long war and that much of this war should be left to be fought by the Middle East.'

But 'we can't leave our embassies unprotected,' he added, resuming his swipe at Clinton. 

'So we have a couple of choices: We either come home completely, and bring everything home, or we defend our embassies and our interests. At this point, what I would say is that we defend our interests.' 

DEVASTATION: The 2012 attack killed four people including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, and was carried out by an al-Qaeda-affiliated group called Ansar al-Shariah

A senior aide to another Republican senator told DailyMail.com that Paul is having a hard time threading the needle.

'Rand is fighting a losing battle,' the aide said. 'You can't tell one audience that we have to isolate ourselves and then tell another one that Hillary Clinton wasn't tough enough on Libyan terrorists. It's not credible.' 

But Paul's camp is insisting that he won't waver on Hillary.

The senator 'believes Mrs. Clinton’s dereliction of duty and indifferent response to the tragic events that occurred in Benghazi are utterly inexcusable,' RANDPAC communications director Sergio Gor told DailyMail.com

'As he stated during her appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Paul would have removed Secretary Clinton from her post' if he had been president at the time.

'Senator Paul declared Libya as "Hillary's War," Gor added, 'due to her desire to act unilaterally without Congressional approval or authorization, thus circumventing Congress.'

But the senator finds himself triangulated between condemning both the kind of proactive Middle Eastern nation-flattening that characterized the George W. Bush administration, and the more reluctant participation that has marked Barack Obama's time in office.

'Every time we've gotten involved to topple a secular dictator, it's been replaced by chaos and the rise of radical Islam,' Paul said. 'And that would be in Hillary's war in Libya; that would also be in the Republican war in Iraq.'

'HILLARY'S WAR': Sen. Paul took time during his Q&A on Tuesday to Bash Hillary Clinton over the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks

Paul signaled a willingness to grab hold of Republicans' hard line on Islamist terror, less than a week after a dozen staffers of the Parisian humor weekly Charlie Hebdo were slaughtered over cartoonish depictions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad. 

'Printing cartoons,' he said, 'shouldn't engender people murdering you.'

He staked out less emotional territory, however, by outlining what he said was 'a war going on between what I call civilized Islam and barbaric Islam.'

'Some conservatives like to criticise the president and say, "Why is he being so nice to Islam?" I think sometimes what he's trying to do is point out that there's a difference.'

Believing that 'everybody in Islam is an enemy of the United States,' he warned, assumes a future that includes 'a horrific, terrible kind of war with, you know, a billion people hating America.'

'I don't think that's true. I think the vast majority of Islam is peace-loving and civilized. But if it's 5 or 10 per cent of Islam, that's a lot of people.'
