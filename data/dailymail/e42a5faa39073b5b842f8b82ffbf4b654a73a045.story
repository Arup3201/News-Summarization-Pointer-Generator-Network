There has been a 50 per cent rise in the number of Britons donating their organs after death since 2008 (file picture)

The number of Britons donating their organs after death has risen by 50 per cent since 2008.

There were just over 1,200 donors in 2012, up from 800 four years earlier.

The organs they provided allowed the number of transplants to rise to 3,100.

The increase has partly been credited to specialist nurses who have difficult conversations with bereaved families about the prospect of their loved one’s organs being donated.

There are now 250 organ donation nurses working in hospitals throughout the UK who sensitively approach relatives shortly after patients have died.

Despite the rise in donations, Britain still has one of lowest rates in Europe and an estimated 1,000 patients die each year waiting for a transplant.

Senior doctors are calling for an overhaul of the system which would see everyone being a potential donor unless they specifically requested otherwise. Ministers are considering introducing the policy in Wales in two years’ time but there are no plans for a similar move in England.

Experts are also concerned that some families are overruling patients’ wishes by refusing to allow their organs to be used. Last year there were 125 cases where relatives intervened even though individuals had signed the NHS Organ Donor Register.

Although families do not have a right to object, doctors often agree not to take organs to avoid dispute. Experts on the Organ Donation Taskforce, a panel set up by the Government, want a law change to ensure patients’ dying wishes to become donors are always respected.

The number on the Organ Donor 
Register has reached a record 18.6million – nearly one in three of the 
population. But the rate of donations is still woefully low compared 
with most of Europe.

Each 
donor has the potential to help up to nine people by giving their heart,
lungs, two kidneys, pancreas, liver, small bowel and two corneas.

Elisabeth Buggins, chairman of the Organ Donation Taskforce, said the rise in donations was a ‘phenomenal achievement’.

She
added: ‘It’s a very sensitive time for the families. It’s also true 
that donor families gain a great deal of comfort in the longer term from
the decision to donate their loved one’s organs.

‘I know families who keep a letter telling them where the organs have gone in their jacket pockets as a comfort they take with them every day.’

Dr Vivienne Nathanson, director of professional activities at the British Medical Association, said: ‘The BMA believes that an opt-out system, as part of an overall package to increase donation, would increase rates even further and save more lives.’

She added: ‘The BMA is very pleased that there has been a 50 per cent increase in deceased organ donation since recommendations were set by the Organ Donation Taskforce in 2008.

‘The whole transplant community has worked tremendously hard to achieve this.’

Sally Johnson, the NHS Blood and Transplant’s director of organ donation and transplantation, said: ‘Although I am delighted that we have made such big advances in the UK, we can and must do more.

‘We need a transformation in donor and family consent to organ  donation because the UK’s family refusal rate remains one of the highest in Europe.

‘Without that, there is only a limited amount more the NHS can do to offer further hope to those on the waiting list for an organ transplant.’ 

The sharp rise in organ donation is largely due to the creation of a network of specialist nurses who support bereaved families and discuss the possibility of organ donation with them.

Specialist nurses are one of a number of recommendations made in 2008 by the Organ Donation Taskforce, following a decade of almost no increase in the number of donated organs.

The taskforce also pushed for the creation of specialist organ retrieval teams and wider promotion and campaigning around the importance of organ donation.

Giving and taking: The number of organs being donated is at an all time high

These recommendations have led to a sharp increase in organ donors across the UK – a rise of 49 per cent rise in England, of 16 per cent in Wales, of 74 per cent increase in Scotland and an astounding 82 per cent increase in Northern Ireland.

Consequently there has been a 31 per cent boost in the number of people receiving a life-saving or enhancing organ transplant since 2008.

‘This is an outstanding achievement that few thought possible at the time this ambition was set,’ said Bill Fullagar, chairman of NHSBT. ‘It is the result of the hard work and dedication of staff in hospitals and communities across the country.

‘We must also share our heartfelt thanks with every family who, at a great time of sadness, supported their loves one's wish to donate their organs and transform the lives of up to nine other people.’

Despite the increase in organ donors, the numbers of families refusing to grant consent remains among the highest in Europe, and NHSBT is calling for more to be done.

In addition to this, lack of organ donation awareness amongst the black and Asian community particularly needs to targeted, according to the NHSBT.

Despite being three times more likely to need a transplant, only three per cent of this section of the population is on the organ donation register.
