Bungling architects in Brazil gave new meaning to the word 'public convenience' - after building bathrooms in a new arts centre with transparent glass walls.

The £800,000 public building in Ponta Grossa, in Brazil's southern state of Parana, was unveiled this week and is covered entirely in glass.

But designers apparently forgot about the loos, which are on the ground floor and give passers-by an unobstructed view of everything happening inside.

With the toilets facing outwards, anyone doing their business would look out onto a busy pedestrian walkway used by university students.

Locals are puzzled by the design and wondering if it's a mistake, or meant to be cutting-edge architecture.

Fitness instructor Rafael Teleska said: 'It's just crazy - I would never use a toilet like this.

'Didn't the architect realise that everybody passing by could come and see?'

Student Lorena Max said: 'Did they so it on purpose to get publicity?  If not, it's the worst planning blunder ever.'

The building also has two emergency exits on the upper floors that open into thin air.

Some locals in Ponta Grossa said they would rather cross their legs and wait than use this toilet in full view of passers-by

Diego Bech told Brazil.dispatch.com:'It's so Big Brother Brazil.  So totally wrong.  Only in Ponta Grossa do these things happen.'

The
planning secretary for Ponta Grossa, Joao Marcal, told Brazil's Globo 
G1 website that the building 'obviously needs some adjustments' and that
the contractor will be responsible for fixing the problem.

The building will house a music school when it opens next month.
