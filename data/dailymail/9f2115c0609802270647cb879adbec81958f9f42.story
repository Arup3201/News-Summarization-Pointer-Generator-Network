A rare white tiger has died after it was bitten by a highly venomous black cobra, which hid inside its cage in an Indian zoo.

Keepers at the Kamala Nehru zoo in Indore, Hyderabad, went to check on two-year-old tiger Rajan in his enclosure on Saturday morning.

The tiger had been brought to the zoo just a month ago as part of a breeding programme for the rare animals.

Rare white tiger Rajan, who was discovered unconscious in its cage at Kamala Nehru zoo in India after being bitten by a venomous cobra 

But when zookeepers opened the door, they found the tiger unconscious, and bleeding from the nose and foaming at the mouth.

Vets were called but they were unable to save the big cat, who was declared dead, with a post mortem examination revealing a poisonous snake bite as a cause of death.

Now zoo officials believe that the cobra somehow found its way into the tiger's enclosure and the two animals began to fight.

The snake then bit the tiger unleashing its venom, which killed the rare animal.

Vets battled to save the two-year-old big cat, pictured, who had only been at the zoo for just over a month, but he unfortunately died 

However, the cobra was also injured in the clash and has been left paralysed with animal experts battling to save it.

Uttam Yadav, the zoo's director, told the Hindustan Times: 'It appears that the tiger had a fight with the snake and died after the snake bit the big cat.

'We found an injured cobra inside of the tiger's cage. When we checked on the tiger it was unconscious. I assume the tiger and cobra had a fight in which the cobra would have bitten and killed the tiger.'

Now the zoo are putting measures in place to make sure snakes are unable to enter the tiger enclosure.

Dr Yadav added: 'As part of precautionary measures, the authority will put thin wire mesh across all the cages, build trenches and put board at some part of cages to block the entry of crawling animals inside the cages.'

The black cobra, which had fought with the tiger and unleashed its venomous bite, which ultimately killed the big cat 

The Indore zoo now only have three white tigresses called Diya, Shivani and Sita.

The park has more than 65 cages and as many as 452 different animals and is one of the most visited attractions in in Hyderabad.

The tiger's death comes after a man was killed by a white tiger after allegedly jumping into its moat at another Indian zoo.

The man, named locally as Maqsood, is said to have been under the influence of alcohol when he climbed into the white tiger enclosure at New Delhi Zoo in September.

Witnesses say the 22-year-old entered the enclosure despite several attempts by zoo security to keep him from the tigers.
