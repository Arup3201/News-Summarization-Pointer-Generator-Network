Venezuela's government is implicating the U.S. ambassador to Colombia in a plot to destabilize President Nicolas Maduro's rule.

Leaders of the ruling socialist party on Wednesday presented what they said were emails written by ousted lawmaker Maria Corina Machado to members of the opposition.

In one dated March 23 Machado describes how Kevin Whitaker offered his support to the opposition and indicated 'new steps'.

At the time Whitaker oversaw Andean affairs at the State Department.

Officials didn't say how the emails were obtained.

A State Department spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the allegations are baseless and an effort by Maduro's government to distract attention from grievances fueling anti-government protests.

The accusations come as U.S House of Representatives is set to vote on imposing sanctions against Venezuelan officials.

Fourteen Democratic members of Congress were voicing opposition to authorizing unilateral U.S. sanctions against Venezuela ahead of a House vote on Wednesday.

The bill instructs the Obama administration to compile a list of human rights abusers in the Venezuelan government, freeze their assets and ban them from the United States.

Foreign relations committees in the House and Senate have overwhelmingly approved it.

Administration officials are opposed. They say sanctions risk undermining mediation efforts in Venezuela and straining relations between the U.S. and Latin American partners.

The Democrats led by Michigan Rep. John Conyers wrote a letter to President Barack Obama on Tuesday backing his administration.

They also urged an exchange of ambassadors with Venezuela after a four-year hiatus. Violent unrest has gripped Venezuela for months. Forty-two people have been killed since February.

In Caracas, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro welcomed the Democratic lawmakers' initiative, saying he hopes 'there is a bit of wisdom' in Washington.

'Thank you for taking this initiative to try to raise awareness and stop, with the conscience of the people of the United States, stop any insolent madness,' the socialist leader said Tuesday night in his radio and television show, In Contact With Maduro.

'Any law that is approved in the United States Congress to sanction Venezuela is spurious,' he added. 'We will not recognize it.'
