The severely injured daughter of a woman found dead at a hotel has died days after her mother's body was discovered.

Nicola McDonough, 23, was found bleeding in a corridor only yards from her seriously hurt mother  Margaret, who died on Friday.

Police had been desperate to speak to the young woman, to solve the mystery of their injuries. But after four days in a critical condition, she lost her fight for life.

Mother and daughter: Nicola McDonough, 23, died three days after Margaret, 52, died in hospital in Greenock

Officers confirmed that both women suffered ‘slashing’ injuries but they were not stabbed.

Detectives said they were not looking
 for a ‘third party’ in relation to the incident, which happened at a 
Premier Inn hotel in Greenock, Renfrewshire, on Friday.

Divorcee and foster mother Mrs McDonough, 52, died shortly after being admitted to the Royal Inverclyde Hospital, Greenock.

Her charity worker daughter spent 
days battling for her life at the same hospital, with relatives, 
including her father Thomas McDonough, keeping a bedside vigil.

Detectives were waiting for her 
condition to improve to interview her for answers. But last night it was
 reported that she, too, had died.

Police in Scotland, who will now have to establish by other means how the tragedy unfolded, yesterday outlined details of the women’s movements before the incident.

and mother, right

They appear to have  travelled to 
Dunbartonshire before checking in to the Greenock hotel, which is barely
 17 miles from their Paisley home.

The women arrived there at around 
3.50pm on Thursday, left a short time later and then returned between 
12.30am and 1am on Friday.

Police were originally investigating 
whether or not a third party had been involved in the tragedy but now 
say they are not looking for anyone else.

Detective Inspector David Wagstaff of Police Scotland said: ‘At present we are keeping an open mind on the circumstances.

‘However, we can confirm that we are 
not looking for any third party at this time. I would urge anyone with 
information, however, insignificant it might seem, to get in touch with 
police.’

Officers want to speak to anyone who 
saw their car, a red Suzuki Swift registration SL56 CBF, in the Paisley 
or Greenock area last Thursday and  Friday.

Mr Wagstaff added: ‘We are still piecing together the last known movements of Margaret and Nicola.

‘Our enquiries have revealed that 
after last being seen in the Paisley area around 9am on Thursday, both 
travelled to the Balloch area and we have a sighting of them around 11am
 in Carrochan Road, Balloch.

‘Were you in the Balloch area on 
Thursday morning? Did you see the red Suzuki Swift? You may have 
information that could assist us.

‘I would also ask anyone who may have
 seen either Margaret or Nicola or their car in the Paisley and Greenock
 area during the course of Thursday and Friday to get in touch. I’d 
particularly like to speak to any of their friends or acquaintances.

‘Were they in touch with you on 
Thursday by phone, face-to-face or via text message? Did they let you 
know about any plans they had made?’

Mr Wagstaff continued: 'I need information from the local communities of Renfrewshire, Inverclyde and Balloch as these are the areas that we know Margaret and Nicola travelled to.'

Mrs McDonough, a foster mother, is believed to have been considering adoption after taking in a girl and boy, aged two and five.

But the children have been removed by social workers.

The former Liberal Democrat candidate
 stood in elections for East Renfrewshire Council. Her candidate profile
 states: ‘She sees first-hand the needs of very vulnerable children in 
her care and their families, and would like to be able to take some of 
that knowledge into the decision-making processes of the council.

‘She also has interest and experience
 in looking at special educational needs for young children to ensure 
that all children reach their full potential.’

Detectives combed the hotel for evidence but say they are still treating the incident as 'unexplained'

A friend, who did not want to be 
named, said: ‘She was a wonderful mum of five grown-up children and I 
expect that is why she decided to become a foster mother, because she 
wanted to carry on looking after children.

‘I remember seeing her in the bank recently with one of her foster children, who was having a huge tantrum.

‘I told her she had her hands full but she was completely calm. She took it in her stride, she was a natural mother.’

The mother and daughter had apparently booked a single night stay at the Premier Inn not far from their home

Mrs McDonough is believed to have 
remained single after her divorce seven years ago. She remained in the 
family home and had five grown-up children, including Nicola.

The others are Kevin, Michael, 
Matthew and Margaret, who are all believed to have kept a vigil beside 
their sister’s hospital bed.

Nicola McDonough recently graduated 
with a social work degree from the University of West of Scotland and 
worked for charity Cosgrove Care, which helps children and adults with 
learning disabilities.

Tributes were last night left for her
 on social networking sites, where only hours before, friends had been 
urging others to pray for her recovery.

One person, Nicole Wallace, wrote: 
‘Thoughts go out to the McDonough family and friends.  Absolutely 
heartbreaking news. Rest in peace, Nicola and her mum.’

Gemma Mullin wrote: ‘RIP to such a lovely girl. So sad to hear, and thoughts are with your family.’
