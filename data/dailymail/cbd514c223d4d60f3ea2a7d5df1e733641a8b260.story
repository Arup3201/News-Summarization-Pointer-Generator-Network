A British psychic who shot to fame on TV shows stabbed his four-year-old twin daughters then leapt out of a window, it is claimed.

Graham Bishop, 58, has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly attacking his daughters with a kitchen knife then stabbing himself at a hospital in Denmark.

Bishop’s wife, who is her 20s, called police who kicked down the door in the room where his daughter Natalie, who has a long term illness, was being treated.

The psychic, who has appeared in Danish TV shows, then jumped out of a window at Rigshospitalets paediatric centre, in Copenhagen and suffered injuries in the fall.

Natalie, now four, was born with aneurisms in her stomach and suffered paralysis on her left side and blindness. She was in a critical condition after the alleged attack

Bishop, who emigrated from Swindon, Wiltshire 12 years ago, was today being kept under police guard at hospital where he is being treated.

His two daughters were in a critical condition in intensive care but they are now improving, police said.

Police inspector Lau Thygesen from Copenhagen Police told the Copenhagen Post after the incident: ‘We are treating it is a family tragedy.’

Bishop claims to be a psychic healer who can cure people when he is possessed by the spirit of a German physician called ‘Dr Karl’.

He has appeared on Danish television shows such as ‘Klarsyn’, ‘Åndernes Magt’, ‘Troldmandsskolen’ amd ‘Ånderne vender tilbage’.

Bishop claims that Dr Karl is his ‘main spirit guide’ who uses the psychic’s body to help heal people in need.

He claims to have healed his daughter of blindness, and cured large numbers of people across the world by laying his hands on them.

His website gives a profile of his daughter, which describes how seven aneurisms were found in her stomach after she was born.

She had emergency treatment and had suffered brain damage, causing her to lose her sight and movement down her left side.

Bishop
writes on his site: 'After no improvement with these, I asked Spirit 
for help, even that it was a risk my own life (I was in a very bad state
of health myself), but what father would not do that for his child ?  I
went into trance and Spirit Dr Karl was able to restore her sight and 
correct the paralysis, unfortunately he was not able to repair the 
kidney.'

Alter-ego: The 19th century German physician called 'Dr Karl' Bishop claims he can channel

It continues: ‘The
first time Spirit Dr Karl undertook healing using my body was in 1992, 
since which time he has helped many thousands of people across Europe 
and the USA.

‘He told them 
his name was Dr Karl and he was born in 1848 into a family of doctors in
Prussia (now part of Germany). He showed a keen interest and skill from
a very early age and performed his first ‘’unofficial’’ operation on a 
person at the age of 12 years.’

‘Since I ‘’woke-up’’ to my own awareness and realised the depth of spiritual knowledge and abilities I have, my whole life changed in ways I could never have imagined.

‘For many years the spiritual things were second place to my successful career in computing, over the years the balance shifted and in 1995 the spiritual became the focus of my work and life.

‘All of my life I felt a bit of an outsider and I have experienced many things that seemed to have no practical explanation.’

A Foreign Office spokesman told the Mail Online: ‘We are aware of the hospitalisation of a British national in Copenhangen on August 12.

‘We stand ready to provide consular assistance if necessary.’
