Shoppers in Birmingham are the nation’s biggest buyers of violent video games, according to new research.

Comparison website PriceSpy.co.uk analysed how many violent video games were bought over the past 12 months across 44 UK cities and towns to see which region bought the most.

Birmingham topped the list ahead of Newcastle and London, and PriceSpy found their results roughly correlated with the areas of the UK that have the highest crime rates.

Sweden-based comparison site PriceSpy found people in Birmingham bought the most violent games, including GTA V, pictured, and Battlefield 3, over the past 12 months. Newcastle was in second place, with London making up the top three

All the games considered violent had a 
Pan European Game Information (PEGI) age rating of 16 or 18 and included
words and phrases such as ‘Extreme violence, ‘Multiple, motiveless 
killing’ and ‘Strong language’ in their descriptions.

The full list included Grand 
Theft Auto IV and V, Battlefield 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Dead 
Space 3, Saints Row 4, Hitman: Absolution, God of War: Ascension, Dead 
Island: Riptide and Mortal Kombat.

Sales data was analysed between October 2012 to October 2013 from 44 UK cities and towns.

Birmingham and London both scored in the top five least peaceful areas in most recent UK Peace Index. 

Figures
from UKCrimestats.com also found London, Birmingham and Newcastle 
all rank in the top ten constituencies with the highest crime rate in 
the UK - in first, fifth and tenth place respectively.

These
findings are in contrast to those in lower crime areas such as Oxford, 
Cambridge and Reading, where online shoppers were revealed by the study 
to have bought fewer violent video games.

In fact, Reading not only topped the list for 
buying the least violent video games, it also came 42nd out of
44 in the UK’s crime hotspot league table.

The study also found a correlation between the cities that bought the most violent games, that included Hitman: Absolution, pictured, and the amount of crime in those regions. Gamers in Reading bought the fewest violent games and ranked 42nd out of 44 on the crime league

Erik Lorentz, Head of Communications at PriceSpy.co.uk, said: ‘The shopping data we have access to gives us a fascinating insight into online consumer shopping trends across the UK. 

'From Southampton to Stockport - we were curious to see which areas snap-up the most violent video games. It will be interesting to see if new releases like Call of Duty Ghosts will top the charts in the run up to Christmas.

‘As we compare the prices of over 20,000 video games, we would always advocate that shoppers follow strict PEGI age classifications, especially when purchasing for younger gamers.’
