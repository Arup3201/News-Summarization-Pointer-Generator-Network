A mother-of-two who lost her life to bowel cancer has become an internet sensation after her heartbreaking last blog about her battle with the disease was viewed more than two million times.

Charlotte Kitley began to record her experiences after being diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2012.

Since starting the blog last year, the 36-year-old from south west London had described going through various treatments and the impact of the disease on her life.

But it was her final blog, posted by her husband Richard on the day she died, that received the most overwhelming response.

Charlotte Kitley's final blog has been viewed by more than two million people since her death on September 16. The 36-year-old was diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer in 2012 and faced two operations to remove tumours from her bowel and liver, 25 rounds of radiotherapy and 39 bouts of chemotherapy

The emotive goodbye message to her husband and their two children Lucy and Danny, has been viewed more than two million times, since last Tuesday.

In it, Mrs Kitley, wrote: 'As you read this, I will no longer be here. 

'Rich will be trying to put one foot in front of the other, to get by, a day at a time, knowing I will no longer awake next to him.

'I have so much life I still want to live, but know I won't have that. 

'I want to be there for my friends as they move with their lives, see my children grow up and become old and grumpy with Rich. 

'All these things are to be denied of me.

'But, they are not to be denied of you. So, in my absence, please, please, enjoy life. 

'Take it by both hands, grab it, shake it and believe in every second of it. Adore your children. 

'You have literally no idea how blessed you are to shout at them in the morning to hurry up and clean their teeth.

'Embrace your loved one and if they cannot embrace you back, find someone who will. Everyone deserves to love and be loved in return. Don't settle for less.'

Her final words read: 'When you close your curtains tonight, look out for a star, it will be me, looking down, sipping a pina colada, enjoying a box of (very expensive) chocolates.

'Good night, Good bye and God bless.

'Charley xx'

Mrs Kitley began her blog, which featured on the Huffington Post, in 2013.

Since her death, her husband Richard said he has been overwhelmed by the level of support he has received.

He has now set up a Just Giving page in her memory, raising money for the charity Bowel Cancer UK.  

Mrs Kitley was diagnosed two weeks after running a half marathon in October 2011 after complaining of back ache.

The mother-of-two prepared a heartbreaking final blog, which was uploaded by her husband after her death 

She wrote in her blog: 'I went to the doctor, but with no real explanation, it took another three months until I met with a back specialist. 

'As a matter of routine, he sent me for an MRI. Following a slight suspicion within my pelvis, I was then sent for an ultrasound and a CT scan. 

'The following day, the back specialist called to see me.

'I don't remember much of the meeting, other than the words 'suspicious mass'.

'I've since been told that given the location of the tumour, I wouldn't have experienced any of the usual signs, such as blood in my poo or stomach ache. 

'My tumour was compressing against my spine, hence my back pain.' 

Further tests led specialists to diagnose Mrs Kitley with stage four bowel cancer, which spread to her liver following her diagnosis.

She faced two operations to remove tumours, the first from her bowel and the second from her liver.

In addition, the mother-of-two faced 25 rounds of radiotherapy and 39 bouts of chemotherapy.  

The treatment worked in clearing Mrs Kitley's bowel cancer but the number of tumours in her liver increased from three to five. 

In November 2011, she was told the cancer had already spread to her lungs. 

She said in her blog: 'I was told it was unlikely any further treatment would be effective and I had around six months to live. 

'It was time to get my affairs in order and spend time with my family. 

In her last blog, Mrs Kitley, wrote: 'In my absence, please, please, enjoy life.'Take it by both hands, grab it, shake it and believe in every second of it. Adore your children.' Pictured is her husband Richard and the couple's two young children Lucy and Danny

Bowel Cancer UK is raising awareness about the type of advanced, stage four bowel cancer, Mrs Kitley suffered.

The Time For Guts campaign is a call to improve survival rates and support those people diagnosed with the disease - the UK's second biggest cancer killer. 

Out of the 41,500 people diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the UK, around 3,800 are diagnosed with advanced, stage four bowel cancer. 

In addition, about half of the 9,800 people diagnosed at stage three will go on to develop advanced bowel cancer.

Fewer than one in ten people diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer will survive for more than five years, compared with nine out of ten people diagnosed at the earliest stage of the disease. 

'I asked if I would make it to my daughter's fifth birthday and was told I would be lucky to get to her third.'

Twenty-two months after being given six months to live, Mrs Kitley passed away on September 16. 

Deborah Alsina, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK said: 'We are all completely devastated and saddened by Charlotte's death. 

'She was such an inspiration for other people with bowel cancer and through her beautifully crafted blog, created a big following among the online community.

'While bowel cancer is thankfully relatively rare in younger people like Charlotte, around 2,100 people under 50 are still diagnosed with it each year, often late. 

'That's why we launched our Never Too Young campaign, to improve the diagnosis, treatment and care of younger bowel cancer patients and to raise awareness among younger people and health professionals. Early diagnosis really does save lives.'
