A firefighter died battling a six-alarm condominium fire and his body was saluted by a line of rescue workers as it emerged from the ruins draped in an American flag.

Stanley Wilson, a 28-year veteran of the Dallas fire department responded to the blaze early Monday morning as smoked poured from the condo complex.

Around 100 other firefighters also answered the call. They at first offensively met the fire head on, but took a more defensive stance once the size and speed of the flames became evident.
