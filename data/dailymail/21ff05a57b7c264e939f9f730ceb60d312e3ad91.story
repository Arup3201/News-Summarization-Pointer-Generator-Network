Tycoon: Michelle Mone has wrested control of her business empire from the hands of her former husband Michael after agreeing to buy his share

She left him amid furious claims he had an affair with one of their lingerie designers.

Now underwear tycoon Michelle Mone – creator of the Ultimo push up bra – has wrested control of her business empire from the hands of her former husband Michael after agreeing to buy his share for an estimated £24million.

The pair, who divorced last month, said they had finally put an end to a year-long legal wrangle today with an ‘amicable agreement’.

Mrs Mone, 41, confirmed her former husband left the company they founded together in a statement, saying: ‘I’m delighted after a tough year this has all come to an end.

‘Michael has left Ultimo today. My focus is my children & growing Ultimo to the next level.’

According to public accounts, Mr Mone, 45, owned just under 48 per cent of the £50million company’s shares – one more than his wife – meaning she may have had to pay him almost £24million to gain control of the business.

Mrs Mone called an end to their 20-year marriage in December 2011. Months later, she claimed he cheated on her with an Ultimo designer, saying: ‘You have to trust your team but there was a lot of deceit and lies – it changed the whole company.’

The businesswoman reportedly hired a private investigator to photograph her husband with the woman, later identified as Samantha Bunn, 31. She later sacked the pretty brunette, who received a £10,000 pay off last year after threatening to launch a case for unfair dismissal.

Mr Mone denied cheating, saying: ‘Prior to our split, there was no relationship. If anyone is saying that is the reason for the split, that is untrue.’

The pair founded their lingerie firm, called MJM International, from a spare bedroom in 1996 and launched the first Ultimo bra in 1999.

Modelled by stars including Penny Lancaster and Rachel Hunter – as well as Mrs Mone herself – its cleavage enhancing qualities proved a huge hit with millions of women.

Its popularity was boosted in 2000 when Julia Roberts wore one of the bras for her role in Erin Brockovich.

Mrs Mone embraced the limelight as the company’s public face, and boosted her profile with TV appearances on Masterchef and The Apprentice. In 2010, she was awarded an OBE for her contribution to business.

Meanwhile, Mr Mone, an accountant, preferred to stay in the background, managing the company’s finances and production line.

She later claimed he was furious when she lost six stone and started modelling her own range, saying: ‘He was appalled I’d posed in my underwear. He didn’t speak to me for days.’

The pair, who have three children together, have now put their luxury home in Thorntonhall, Lanarkshire, up for sale.

In a joint statement today, they said: ‘We are both saddened that our marriage has broken down, however we are pleased to confirm that we have reached an amicable agreement on all matters. 

‘We wish each other all the best as we embark upon the next chapter of our lives and, as parents, are committed to continuing to work together in the best interests of our children. 

‘This has been a difficult time for all involved and we would ask the media to please respect our privacy.’

Mrs Mone’s spokesman did not reply to a request for comment yesterday.

Mrs Mone posted a picture of her lawyer on Twitter, saying: ‘Ha my lawyer is exhausted. I can’t thank you enough Tony Caplan x’

She added: ‘Ha he’s also very expensive, but he’s worth it. I can’t tell you how happy I am for my family & team at Ultimo.’
