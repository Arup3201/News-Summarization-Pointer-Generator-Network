A former TV weatherman has been found guilty of sending hundreds of sexually explicit texts to a teenage boy.

Rob Lopicola, 43, was found guilty yesterday on one count of using text messages to solicit sex and another count of computer pornography and child exploitation, and could now face up to 20 years in jail.

Lopicola, who worked at WPTV-Ch. 5 in West Palm Beach until his unexplained exit in 2006, was acquitted of another charge of having oral sex with the then-15-year-old in October 2010.

During his trial Lopicola dismissed the messages he sent in the months after the alleged meeting as 'fantasy fun', claiming they were part of a harmless 'fetish'.

But state prosecutor Michael Kugler heavily criticised his two-hour appearance on the stand, telling jurors Lopicola had used his on-camera skills to 'schmooze' them.

Lopicola said he had met the boy through a classified advert on Craigslist, and believed he was over 18 when he started messaging.

The presenter, who also spoke about his battle with alcohol addiction, said he thought the boy was pretending to be young for the sake of the fantasy.

Lopicola is also facing a separate charge of unlawful sexual activity with a 17-year old

However Ms Kugler pointed out that, whether Lopicola knew the boy was underage or not, he had still committed a crime.

Kristy Militello, defending Lopicola, said that the boy had encouraged him by sending flirtatious text messages back, and criticised the teenager for deleting the messages from his phone.

The boy, now 18 and attending a school in Georgia, said he sent the messages out of loneliness and denied suggestions he was trying to set Lopicola up.

Lopicola, who remains in custody in Palm Beach County Jail, is also charged with unlawful sexual activity with a 17-year-old in a separate case which will be heard on Monday.

A weekend forecaster for nearly eight years, Lopicola covered some of the biggest weather events in the past decade, including hurricanes Frances, Jeanne, and Wilma in 2004 and 2005.

'I have spoken in front of a lot of people when I was a weatherman,' Lopicola told the jury. 'I'd get a little nervous â€” but this is a terrible feeling.'

Sentencing has been adjourned until December 6 when Lopicola faces between 34 months and 20 years in jail.
