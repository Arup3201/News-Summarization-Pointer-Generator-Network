The body of Garrett Elsey, 22, from Alberta, Canada, was found at a waste treatment facility in Bristol

A Canadian student was crushed to death in the back of a bin lorry before being found at a waste facility, it has been revealed.

Garrett Elsey, from Alberta, was discovered at a recycling plant in Bristol a day after arriving in the UK to start a masters degree in international security.

Police are trying to work out how he ended up in a communal waste bin that was then picked up and taken to New Earth Solutions last Thursday Morning.

He is believed to have been out on a night drinking with a friend from Canada he used to play rugby with.

The friends went their separate ways after the drinking session - but Mr Elsey somehow ended up in a communal bin kept behind closed doors next to the Jacobs building in Jacob's Wells Road.

Police sources have now confirmed that the popular 22-year-old may still have been alive when he was picked up on the lorry's collection round.

Avon and Somerset police have said further investigations are needed before the cause of death can be officially confirmed, but it is understood his injuries were caused by crushing.

Force spokeswoman Claire Stanley said: 'We have provisional findings, however further investigations need to take place in conjunction with the coroner.

'This may take time, which means we cannot confirm cause of death at this stage.'

An inquest is likely to be opened later this week and adjourned for several months for information and evidence to be gathered.

Mr Elsey’s family still have many burning questions they want answered.

It is believed the student arrived in 
the UK on Wednesday night, but the airline lost his luggage. His uncle 
Brent said he sent a text message to his parents to say he had checked 
into his new digs and all was well.

His body was found in a bin in Clifton, Bristol, a day after going out with a friend

The bright 22-year-old had recently completed a degree in history and political science at Ottawa’s Carleton University and had posted on his Twitter web page of his excitement at moving to study at Bristol University.

His parents were given the shocking news of his death last Thursday, by officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Bristol police had identified him from his passport and the fingerprints he gave when he entered the UK.

Paying
 tribute to Mr Elsey, his uncle said: 'He was always happy. He was a 
very hard worker. He always tried to do the best that he could. He was 
not afraid of any kind of challenge and was very successful at most of 
the things he put his hand to.'

The 22-year-old's body was discovered at New Earth Solutions, Avonmouth

A bin lorry from New Earth Solutions, similar to the one in which Garrett Elsey was crushed to death.

Residents at the Clifton apartment block were horrified by what appears to have happened.

Communal bins at Belgrave Road and Park Place, Clifton, and Brandon Villas, Hotwells, were also among nine areas cordoned off by police, who then narrowed down their investigations to the communal bins store at Jacobs Building, next to West End car park.

A woman who lives there said: 'It was a complete shock - the circumstances are a bit concerning really.'

Another resident added: 'It’s grim.'

Nobody from May Gurney has been available for comment.
