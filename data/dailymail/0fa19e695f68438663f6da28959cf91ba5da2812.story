A woman has been dubbed 'the human kebab' after she survived being skewered by a steel rod through the entire length of her body.

Wu Xingxian, 42, was working at a construction site in Duchang county in south China's Jiangxi province when a wooden plank on which she was standing broke.

She fell 20ft on to a steel rod below that penetrated through her left thigh, went through her stomach and chest and exited at her neck.

Wu Xingxian, 42, was rushed to the No. 1 People's Hospital in the city of Jiujiang where doctors took this X-ray

'I didn't know a steel road had gone into my body. I just felt there was something on my neck and I tried to touch it.

'When people told me a steel rod had gone right through me, I didn't dare move any more and I felt quite scared. I thought I was going to die.' Wu said.

She was rushed to the No. 1 People's Hospital in the city of Jiujiang.

According to the doctor, Yuan Xiangyang, the two metre-long steel rod had penetrated almost the whole length of Wu's body.

Lifesaving operation: It took a team of surgeons five hours to remove the rod from Wu's body

He said: 'It looked pretty bleak, the rod had caused severe internal damage and was also right next to her heart.'

By the time she reached the hospital, Wu had lapsed into a coma, which was a good thing according to the doctor.

'If there had been any movement, the patient's arteries would likely break and the patient would die instantly from massive blood loss.'

He led a team of surgeons in a five hour operation to remove the rod from her body. If she avoids infection, she should make a full recovery.

Dr Yuan added: 'This should by rights have been a fatal injury. I would not have expected her to live through it, but luckily she did. She is an extraordinary woman.'
