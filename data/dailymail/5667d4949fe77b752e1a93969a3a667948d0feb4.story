To celebrate the release of LEGO The Lord of the Rings, MailOnline talked to the game's Executive Producer, Nick Ricks, on what it takes to build their most epic game yet.

1. What made you want to take on The Lord of the Rings?

Nick: 'We have always have been passionate about bringing incredible stories to a younger audience, and few tales fit the bill more so than The Lord of the Rings.

'The opportunity to re-create Middle-earth, with its vast array of heroic characters, stunning locations and menacing villains, has been something we’ve discussed for a long time.

Happy family: Expect to meet all of the characters on your journey around Middle-earth.

'However, we were conscious that to do justice to these well-loved tales would be an incredible challenge. It’s only now that our tools and technology have advanced sufficiently to enable us to create a LEGO Middle-earth that meets everyone’s expectations (including ours).'

2. Is this your most ambitious LEGO project  yet?

Nick: 'Without a doubt. The game comprises of eighteen levels, covering the major sections of all three films; from the battle on the slopes of Mount Doom, through to epic recreations of Helm’s Deep, Shelob’s Lair and many more.'

'Additionally, there are more than eighty characters to find and collect, so in these aspects alone we already have a LEGO game of unrivalled scope.

'However, on top of this, the players will be able to explore all of LEGO Middle-earth, where dozens of side-quests can be unlocked and LEGO Mithril bricks can be found and forged into new magical items. All in all it adds up to the biggest game we’ve ever created.'

3.Talk me through the development process. Have you used the books as inspiration, too?

Nick: 'The first thing we do whenever a new game is started is to understand what elements are unique about the property.

'What makes The Lord of the Rings different from say Batman or Harry Potter...? For us the core of the Lord of the Rings story is a sense of a quest or journey: both a physical journey; from Hobbiton to Mordor, and an emotional one; with the characters fulfilling their destinies. Once established we attempt to distil these elements into game-play.

Pixel perfect: Gandulf is instantly recognisable, and audio is taken directly from the movies.

'The sense of a physical journey has been captured in the creation of LEGO Middle-earth itself. By basing the gameplay in an open world, the player really does need to embark on this journey, having to travel to key locations (such as Weathertop of Edoras) where they can engage in “traditional” action-adventure levels.

'This way the journey, encompassing all of the astounding locations and intricate side-quests, truly becomes an integral part of the gamers’ experience.

'The sense of the emotional journey is encompassed in the new “Treasure Trove” feature. As the characters continue on their quest, so they grow and realise their full potential.

'Sam and Frodo begin as meek and mild Hobbits, but end up with the nobility of Middle-earth bowing down to them, or Strider the Ranger must confront his destiny and become Aragorn the King.

'To emulate this we reward the player’s progression with new powers and abilities that are accessed through the Treasure Trove.

'So, for example, Legolas is gifted the Bow of the Galadhrim, Frodo gains the Light of Elendil. These amazing magical items grant new powers and abilities to the player’s characters, emulating the progression they take in the fiction.

'Once these foundations have been set, so the corresponding game mechanics can be prototyped and implemented, alongside the crafting of the levels and environments through which the characters will travel.

'Part of this process is reviewing both the theatrical and written fiction for sources of further inspiration, so fans of the books will notice references that were not included in the films.'

4. What has been the biggest challenge so far?

Nick: 'Amongst the many significant challenges we’ve faced making LEGO The Lord of the Rings the greatest has been the realisation of the Middle-earth itself.

'The creation of a seamlessly streaming open world was vital to capture the sense of the epic journey, which we identified as being at the heart of the story.

'The player begins their quest in Hobbiton and from here, the snow-capped peaks of the Misty Mountains can be seen, and players know that they can journey to there without interruption.

Watch your step: Legolas traverses a snowy peak. Environments are a mixture of organic and LEGO materials.

'Once across the mountains and into the lands of the Rohirrim so Edoras, Isengard and even the glowering Eye of Sauron, endlessly gazing out atop Barad-dûr, can be seen and reached.

'This provides a sense of immersion unparalleled in a LEGO game, and justifies the tremendous investment gone into its creation.'

5. The graphics are stunning. How have you achieved this with the aging consoles?

Nick: 'I’m delighted that you think so; we’re all very proud of what we’ve created. Naturally, with the award-winning production design of the movies as basis, we had a terrific head start.

'But, whilst locations such as Weathertop or Minas Tirith are recognisable from the films, there are hundreds of other locations that the team have had to conceptualise and build from scratch.

'Here their commitment and dedication has come to the fore, to ensure that all of LEGO Middle-earth looks as fantastic and vibrant as people would expect.

'One advantage that the current generation of consoles does offer is that the hardware is very familiar to us.

'As such the team are able to squeeze every last drop of processing power to ensure that the lighting, environments, audio (to name just a few) are as stunning as you’ve already noted.'

6. Any news on downloadable content?

Nick: 'With a story of this scale, with such a diverse collection of heroes and villains, there were some that we could not fit into the main game.

'Characters like Smeagol, Corsairs of Umbar and many others from the films are available as DLC, as are others taken from the written fiction, such as Prince Imrahil, the Barrow-wight and Glorfindel.

My precious: A frustrated-looking Gollum takes some time out in the marshes.

'Additionally, we’re also able to offer some characters that are unique to a LEGO Middle-earth, so we have a Mini-Balrog or Sauron in his fair '2nd Age' guise.

'Moreover with the “Treasure Trove” feature, the team have also been to create a DLC pack of weapons and magical items that are both devastating and humorous in equal measure.

7. Does the soundtrack stay true to the films?

Nick: 'Indeed. One of our ambitions was to re-create the cinematic feel of the movies – after all this is the first time we’ve adapted an Academy Award winning film in LEGO form!

'As such, the inclusion of Howard Shore’s score is essential in transporting the player to Middle-earth right from the very first screen.

'On top of that we’ve also included the actual theatrical dialogue, voiced by the original actors, and had it spoken through the mouths of the LEGO mini-figs.

'We pondered long and hard over this decision, as in most of our previous games the characters have mimed or used simple grunts. But as soon as we trialled it what were immediately convinced of its efficacy.

'Having such world-renowned actors like Sirs Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee delivering their lines greatly increase the drama, as well as providing the story’s narrative in clear and concise fashion.

'However, in no way does this detract from the charm and irreverence normally associated with our games, in fact it has provided a whole new medium for LEGO humour.'

8. What have you done to expand areas only hinted on in the movies?

Nick: One of the many successes of Peter Jackson’s adaptations was his ability to conjure up the agelessness of the world.

'In the written fiction, even the Sun and the Moon are relatively new to Middle-earth, and for millennia races and civilisations have risen and fallen.

'We strived to re-create this timeless quality into the game as well. As the player explores all of the secrets of Middle-earth, so they’ll discover ancient castles long abandoned, hidden caves and ruined dungeons.

Fierce: Orks are your main foes, but along your quest, you'll encounter other beasts, too.

'We were eager to bring this timeless quality across in the game, as we know older gamers will appreciate the depth it brings, and younger gamers will be introduced to it for the first time.

'I hope it will spark their interest in The Lord of the Rings, and inspire them to read the novels and watch the films as they grow older.

'It’s an immense privilege, and great responsibility, to introduce this world to a younger audience. and, if they do go on and enjoy the broader fiction, the LEGO games and toys will have framed their experience, and introduced them to the story in a familiar and fun way.'
