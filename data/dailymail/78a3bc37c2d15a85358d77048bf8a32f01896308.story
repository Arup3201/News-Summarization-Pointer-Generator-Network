Former New York City mayor RudyÂ Giuliani says the Mafia put out a $800,000 contract to kill him within weeks of taking office.

The 69-year-old said that during his time in office the price on his head fell, with a second member of the Mafia offering only $400,000 near the end of his term in 2001.

He told Oprah's Where Are They Now? show that despite the threats from organized crime gangs, what really scared him was Islamic extremists.

Threats: Rudy Giuliani says two members of the Mafia put out contracts to kill him

'Part of why I didn't worry about the Mafia was because there was a certain rationality to their kind of 
violence. This other kind of violence is completely irrational 
violence,' he said in an interview that aired on Sunday.

'When we start talking about Islamic extremist terrorism - that worries me more, because they are suicidal,' he added.

The U.S. attorney said he made lots of enemies during his two terms as mayor.

'I don't think anybody prosecuted more Mafia members than I did. Certainly, no one sent them to prison for the 
lengthy periods of time than I did,' he said.

Mr Giuliani claimed in the interview that the Sicilian Mafia offered $800,000 to kill him during his first year in office and, near the end of his term, a Mafia member jailed for 100 years put out a $400,000 contract on him.

'I kind of felt bad that I went down in value - I started at 800, I went down to 400,' he said, making light of the situation.

The former mayor, who was in office at the time of the 9/11 terror attacks, said he was proud at the way New York coped.

'Tourism set a record last year - 50 million people,' he said, during an interview filmed as he walked down the city streets.

'Fifty million, which shows you that even though we were attacked, even though there was threats of attacks, people know how to process it correctly. They realize it's a small, small risk in comparison to the wonderful things you can do here.'

Mr Giuliani said it was hard readjusting to everyday life after his mayoral term came to an end, saying that he would jump every time he heard sirens.

As well as returning to his career as a lawyer, the former mayor has founded Giuliani Partners, which offers advice to governments and private companies on how to deal with terrorism and crime.
