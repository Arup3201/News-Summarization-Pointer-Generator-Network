Former Australian Test spinner Greg Matthews has slammed the Australian team for the way they reacted when Virat Kohli was hit in the helmet by a bouncer on day three of the first Test against India in Adelaide on Thursday.

A rising short-pitched delivery from Mitchell Johnson hit Kohli in the head as he tried to duck out of the way. The India captain was immediately surrounded by Aussie players checking whether he was OK.

But although it was an understandable response considering the circumstances of Philip Hughes' recent death, Mathews believed that it's time to get back to playing the game.  

'If I was disappointed with anything it was the over-reaction,' Matthews told News.com.au.

'Umpires running in from everywhere, players converging, Mitchell getting a back rub and four guys around him holding his hand...

'It’s a Test match. It’s tough cricket out there, you want people getting on with it.

'Sure if he was badly hurt let’s go up and make sure he’s OK. But he ... stood up and shook it off.

'Watching the umpires and everyone converge just highlighted something we need to move past.'

However, Nathan Lyon's heart skipped a beat when it happened.

The Australian spinner said the sound made by Johnson's bouncer on Kohli's helmet was similar to when Hughes was fatally hit.

Lyon sought out his Australian teammates Shane Watson, David Warner and Brad Haddin - the quartet were playing for NSW when Hughes was felled while batting for South Australia a little over a fortnight ago.

'Your heart skips a beat,' Lyon said.

'Especially for the four guys out there, I know I went to everyone just to ask if they were okay because it's something that you don't want to see again, when we were out there with Phil's incident.

'And today that sound was pretty familiar.

'That is why we all ran in there quite quickly just to see if he was okay, that is the main thing.

'It's something that you don't want to see ever again, what we saw with Phil.' 

Johnson reacted immediately to check on the Indian skipper's welfare, as did several Australian players including Haddin, Warner, captain Michael Clarke, and Steve Smith.

The test match has been dedicated to late batsman Hughes, Australia's 13th man, who died two weeks ago today after being struck in the neck by a bouncer. 

The incident, just before lunch, is the first time a batsman has been struck in the head since the tragedy took place a fortnight ago at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

Kohli went on to make 115, guiding India to 5/369 at stumps in reply to Australia’s first innings score of 5/517 declared.

Words of encouragement from the Aussie skipper Michael Clarke for paceman Mitchell Johnson, who was noticeably shaken up after his delivery struck the Indian captain on the helmet

Earlier, captain Clarke surprised most by taking the field after Australia's declaration.

The Australians called a halt to their first innings, leaving Smith unbeaten on 162, his highest Test score.

Rain and bad light restricted the second day to 30.4 overs, with Thursday's play starting half an hour earlier to make up some of the lost time.

Clarke, despite battling a chronic back injury which put him in hospital after day one made 128 after retiring hurt on the opening day.

The skipper didn't take part in Australia's warm-up drills ahead of the third day's play but took the field when play started

Clarke has shifted from his usual slot in slips, fielding instead at mid-off.
