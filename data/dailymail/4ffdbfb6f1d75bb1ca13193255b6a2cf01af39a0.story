As a teenager with Hot Gossip, she sang I Lost My Heart To  A Starship Trooper – and this week Sarah Brightman will announce she is to become  a cosmonaut herself.

Ms Brightman, 52, plans to join a Russian Soyuz spacecraft going to the International Space Station (ISS).

The trip is said to be costing the star, who was once married to Andrew Lloyd Webber, about £5 million – although one estimate has put it as high as £20 million.

Russian space agency sources said that the world’s biggest-selling soprano, who is worth £30 million, secretly visited Moscow last month and ‘successfully completed all the necessary medical  tests and checks’.

Ms Brightman’s flight is likely to be in 2014 or 2015 and she will undergo at least six months of intensive training at Russia’s restricted Star City, where all cosmonauts are prepared for flights.

She is likely to spend between ten days and two weeks in space.

On its return to Earth, her space capsule will parachute down to the steppes of Kazakhstan.

She will be the eighth fare-paying passenger, but only the second woman, to go to the ISS.

Several astronauts reportedly have volunteered for the yearlong mission.

Sarah is the world's richest female classical performer.

An English classical crossover soprano, actress, songwriter and dancer, Brightman is famous for possessing a vocal range of over three octaves.

She has also sung in many languages, including English, Spanish, French, Latin, German, Italian, Russian, Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
