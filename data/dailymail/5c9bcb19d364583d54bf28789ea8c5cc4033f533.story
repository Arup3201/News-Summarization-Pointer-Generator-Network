In the Stockton-on-Tees hall of fame, Richard Kilty is sandwiched between John Walker, the inventor of the matchstick, and George Stephenson, who envisaged the first passenger steam train.

There can be no doubt which hometown boy is delivering the most high-octane thrills these days, but even the most fanciful residents in the North East market town could not have predicted the success Kilty now enjoys back in 2013.

After missing out on the London Olympics with a torn hamstring he had no coach, no Lottery funding, had quit athletics and was about to join the Army.

Kilty was not a stranger to hard times. As a 13-year-old, for seven months he shared one room in a homeless hostel with his parents and four siblings after the family ran into financial difficulties.

Citing his ‘mental strength’, he decided to give athletics one last roll of the dice.

It paid off with a 60m gold medal at the World Indoor Championships in Sopot last year, where he surprised everyone - including the bookmakers who had him at 33-1 - by beating Jamaican Nesta Carter in the final.

Boosted by his extra income, Kilty has rejoined the Linford Christie training group of which he was a part in the run-up to London 2012. 

Asked after his golden 6.51sec season’s-best run on Sunday what Christie had brought to the party, Kilty did a double gun salute.

‘I’m stronger. I’ve got a bit more bicep there,’ he said, ‘We didn’t necessarily train for the indoors but if you saw the semi-final I dropped my arms and could have run about 6.45sec.’

He doubts whether even the Americans and Jamaicans, including Usain Bolt, could beat him over the distance. 

‘Kim Collins beat me a couple of times but a lot of people beat me early season. They don’t count. In a championship I think it would be very difficult.’

He has now set his sights on breaking that hallowed 100m 10-second barrier outdoors.

‘Some people think I’m a spring runner but you’ve only seen me on the scene for 12 months now.

‘If you watched the race today and saw the way I ran away from the field you can see what is going to happen outdoors.’
