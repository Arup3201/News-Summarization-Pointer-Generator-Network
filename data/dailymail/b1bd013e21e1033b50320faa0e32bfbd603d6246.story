The average house in the UK earned more than the average worker in the last year, as house prices rose at their fastest rate in almost a decade.

A study found that house prices increased by 12 per cent – or £29,339 - over the last twelve months, while the average worker took home earnings of £27,271.

The research, compiled by the Centre for Economics and Business Research for the Post Office, shows that more than 60 per cent of the working population earned less than the average home.

A typical home’s earnings now outpace those of a number of our most-relied upon professions, and significantly exceed the starting salaries of a junior hospital doctor (£22,636), a graduate nurse (£21,388), a teacher (£22,023), a police officer (£23,317) and a soldier (£17,945).

Commenting on the findings, John Willcock, head of mortgages at Post Office said: 'Property prices have soared over the last year, following a long period of recovery – and are set to increase further over the next five years.

'Whilst this is good news for those that already own their home, our study highlights the struggle that buyers and movers looking to climb the property ladder face, especially in getting on that all-important first rung.”

Growth: A typical home’s earnings now outpace those of a number of  a graduate nurse - £21,388

Homeowners in the East, South East and London saw their earnings outclassed the most – with properties in each region earning £34,002, £35,188, and £80,462 respectively.

Houses in the nation’s capital earned £80,462 – almost twice as much as the average London salary (£41,095).

They now earn more than the average earnings of a fully qualified doctor in the UK (£70,648).

It also emerged that the rate at which houses earn is climbing.

The average home earned more than £20,000 more this year than it did in the previous one (£8,954 compared to £29,339) as the market boomed.

In contrast, while house prices grew 12 per cent over the last 12 months, the average worker saw their pay increase by just 0.6 per cent.

Mr Willcock adds: 'Forecasts indicate that this year’s strong house price growth will most likely be followed by a slight contraction of 0.8 per cent in 2015, as the market responds to the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) guidance.

'One of the impacts of MMR is a lengthening in transaction times and more rigorous criteria, meaning the overall process of buying and moving is taking longer.

'However, as demand for properties remains high those on the hunt for first homes and dream properties will continue to face substantial costs. Another factor contributing to this contraction is the decline in demand from overseas buyers which has affected house prices in the capital.'
