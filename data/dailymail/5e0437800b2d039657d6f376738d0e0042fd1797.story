Kevin Pietersen's chances of play for Surrey next summer have reduced significantly amid reports Kumar Sangakkara is set to sign on as the Oval's next overseas star.

Having already been dropped by England across all formats, Pietersen has been de-registered by Surrey but had hopes of agreeing to a new deal by the start of next season. 

However, The Sun reports Sri Lankan keeper-batsman Sangakkara could sign with the London-based country side within days.

With 37-year-old Sangakkara's possible deal commanding a substantial fee, there would unlikely be any room in the budget for what Pietersen would be expecting. 

Pietersen’s contract with Surrey expired in August, making him a free agent, and he's since plied his trade as a Twenty20 mercenary in India, the Caribbean and he's due to line up for Melbourne Stars in Australia's Big Bash League in the southern hemisphere summer.

The batsman's also kept himself in the spotlight after the release of his controversial book, KP: The Autobiography, which was published in October.

Fifth-ranked ODI batsman in the world, Sangakkara has two half centuries in the current England series 

Pietersen didn't play County Championship division two for Surrey last campaign, preferring only limited overs cricket when he wasn't injured.

Sangakkara, who's had previous stints at Warwickshire and Durham, plans to retire from all formats after the World Cup, but has been asked by Sri Lanka selectors to consider playing on in Tests.

The left-hander is 12 short of 12,000 Test runs after 128 Tests at an average of 58.76 and is also a star of the 50-over format with 13,050 runs at an average of 40.15. 

And he signed off last season's stay with Durham with a knock of 159 in a draw with Sussex. 

Surrey have been unlucky with big name signings in recent years, with Graeme Smith and Ricky Ponting both suffering injuries during their time at the county.
