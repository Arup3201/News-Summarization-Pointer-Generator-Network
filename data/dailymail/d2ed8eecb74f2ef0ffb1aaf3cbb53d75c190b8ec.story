Kathie Lee Gifford has stood up for her husband against his latest cheating allegations.

The morning talk show host said that her 83-year-old husband could not remember whether or not he had an affair with Johnny Carson's second wife, as Carson's friend alleged in a new tell-all book.

The affair between former NFL star Gifford and Joanne Carson reportedly took place in 1970, while Gifford was married to his first wife Maxine.

Gifford married Maxine, his college sweetheart, in 1952 and were together for 26 years which means that the alleged Carson affair would have come during that time.

Now, two wives later, it was up to Kathie Lee to answer the claims when she took her desk on the Today Show this morning.

On defense: Frank Gifford's alleged affair with Joanne Carson reportedly took place in 1970 during his first marriage but today his third wife Kathie Lee had to explain the situation during her show

'I got the call and Frank was still asleep and... (she said) "Tell me, tell me! It was a long time ago. Did you have an affair with her?"' she recalled saying.

'"I can't remember, maybe?"' she said as her husband's response.

'No it's not true,' she followed up quickly.

She was clear not to make total light of the claims, however, as she even threw in a jab about her husband's much publicized affair with a stewardess during their own marriage that was made public after it was revealed that the woman was paid by a tabloid to arrange the trysts.

'Although the man is capable of it as you know. It's not- he was friends with Joanne,' Kathie Lee said

Still together: This is not the first time that infidelity has been an issue for the former NFL star as his marriage to Kathie Lee (seen together in April) was rocked in 1997 from an affair

Reading the news: Kathie Lee opened up about the issue during her portion of the Today Show on Tuesday

Expressive: Kathie Lee made light of the alleged affair, saying that her husband can't remember

1952: Frank Gifford marries college sweetheart Maxine Ewart. This was the same year he joined the NFL as a first-round draft pick.

The couple had two sons- Jeff and Kyle- and a daughter Vicki who married Robert Kennedy's son Michael in 1981. They separated when it was revealed that he had an affair with their teenage babysitter. He died months later during a game of ski-football with relatives.

1970: When Frank allegedly had an affair with Joanne Carson, the second wife of Johnny.

1976: Frank and Maxine divorce.

1978: Frank marries Astrid Lindley.

1982: Frank meets Kathie Lee Johnson on the set of Good Morning America and they maintain a four year friendship.

1986: Frank divorces Astrid, and marries Kathie Lee on October 16 of the same year.

1997: Flight attendant Suzen Johnson is paid a reported $75,000 by tabloid The Globe to tape two trysts with Frank.

Co-host Hoda Kotb held up one of the 
local newspapers that had the story splayed across the front page where 
Gifford is pictured with his then-wife Maxine and Joanne Carson is 
pictured with her then-husband, famed Tonight Show host Johnny.

Kotb mentioned that she thought that was Joanne in both pictures, and Kathie Lee was quick to note the similarities.

'She does look a little like Joanne doesn't she?' she said.

'It's never a dull moment in our house!'

The news of the alleged Gifford-Carson affair broke on Monday when Carson's friend Henry Bushkin released an excerpt of his tell-all book where he details how he and Johnny broke into a secret apartment that Joanne was leasing without his knowledge.

'I have reason to believe my wife is cheating on me,' Carson reportedly told Bushkin.

'I also have an idea who the son of a b**** is that she's shacking up with.'

When they arrived at the apartment and
saw six or seven framed photos of Gifford, who was also on television 
as a frequent commenter for Monday Night Football, Carson began to cry.

Now 70-years-old, Bushkin's 
revelatory tale is just one of many he recounts in his memoir, 'Johnny 
Carson', that charts the 18-years he worked for the comedian as his 
lawyer, wingman, fixer and closest confidant and hits bookshelves on 
October 15th.

Gifford's
well-publicized infidelities of the past add some semblance of 
credibility to the claims, as his affair with flight attendant Suzen 
Johnson in 1997 was splashed across New York City papers throughout the 
ordeal.

It came after he and Kathie Lee touted the strength of their marriage in infomercials for a marriage counselor and after they both told different versions of their personal histories in their respective biographies.Â 

According to a 1997 article in People Magazine, Frank wrote about his cheating past but said that his third wife, Kathie Lee, cured him of that.

'I get along great with women, but there's no sexual undercurrent anymore,' he wrote in his 1994 biography.

Kathie
Lee made light of his lady-killer past, saying that his sole 
indiscretion 'was the time he sleepwalked in the nude and wound up in 
the nanny's bedroom'.
