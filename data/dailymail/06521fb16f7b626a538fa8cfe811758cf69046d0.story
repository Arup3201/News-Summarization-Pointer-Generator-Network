Home Secretary Theresa May has emerged as the bookies favourite to succeed David Cameron after taking on the police

Theresa May has been installed as the favourite to succeed David Cameron as her extraordinary confrontation with police leaders was hailed as one of the bravest political speeches of recent decades.

Conservative MPs expressed admiration for the Home Secretary’s declaration at the Police Federation conference that a string of scandals has left the legitimacy of British policing under threat.

Britain’s former ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, told the BBC Daily Politics programme that Mrs May had ‘echoes of Margaret Thatcher’ and had delivered ‘one of the most powerful, courageous and candid speeches by a Cabinet minister I have ever seen’.

One senior Conservative woman said: ‘Theresa was already a contender to succeed David Cameron but some of my more boorish male colleagues haven’t taken the idea entirely seriously. That will now change.’

William Hill promptly slashed the odds on Mrs May succeeding Mr Cameron as the next leader of the Tory party, making her 4/1 favourite ahead of the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the 5/1 second favourite and Michael Gove at 8/1.

'Mrs May's speech to the Police Federation seems to have done her leadership prospects no harm at all,’ said the bookmaker’s Graham Sharpe.

Making her annual appearance at the federation’s conference in Bournemouth, the Home Secretary left officers at the conference in stunned silence as she used the speech to upbraid them for often displaying ‘contempt for the public’, and reel off allegations of corruption cases including the Stephen Lawrence and Daniel Morgan murders.

She said the federation, which represents 126,000 rank and file officers, and had faced accusations of bullying and a lack of transparency in its accounts, now had to change from ‘from top to bottom’.

Officers would no longer automatically become members of the federation, instead having to opt in, the Home Secretary added.

He announcement that she was cutting off public funds for the federation was seen as the most aggressive act by central government towards police rank and file since the defeat of the police strike in 1918, nearly a century ago.

Public money previously spent on the federation will instead go towards a new scheme called Police First, aimed at attracting university graduates into the force.

Former Labour activist Dan Hodges claimed Mrs May had given ‘one of the most incredible speeches delivered by a British politician in peacetime’.

He said he struggled to think of a time when a politician had ‘laid it on the line like that’, comparing it to Neil Kinnock’s infamous confrontation of Labour’s Militant wing in 1985.

‘She began in conciliatory tone, remembering fallen officers, and delivering a tribute to the understated bravery of their colleagues and then, without missing a beat, she tore the police service apart,’ he said.

‘Slowly and methodically the Home Secretary read out the charge sheet. Finally a senior politician has told the Police Federation what it needed to hear. 

'Whatever issues David Cameron’s party have with the police, they are still the putative party of law and order. 

'It was the equivalent of [ex-Labour minister] Andy Burnham turning up to the Royal College of Nursing when he was Health Secretary and telling their delegates, "Forget all that stuff about you all being angels. Patients have been dying of thirst on your watch, and it has to stop".’

Ed Owen, former adviser to Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw said: ‘It is the sort of speech I wish in retrospect my former boss had been able to make. He should have done.’

Will Riches, who is hoping to become the Police Federation’s chairman, said he was at a loss to understand the tone of the Home Secretary's address.

He said delegates had arrived at the auditorium prepared to agree to reform but were left in ‘anger and bewilderment’.

But Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester police and vice-president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I have to agree with a lot of what the home secretary said. A lot of the various scandals have damaged the image of policing. The federation needs to get on with the change agreed yesterday.’

The steely Home Secretary, hailed as 'Britain's Angela Merkel' by her allies, would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to David Cameron, and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him.

However, she is understood to regard Boris Johnson as 'faintly ridiculous' and is determined to prevent him becoming leader in the event of the Tories losing the next election.
