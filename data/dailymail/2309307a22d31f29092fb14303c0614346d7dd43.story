Spain's Euro 2012 heroes got the royal seal of approval today as two special little fans welcomed the team home.

Princess Letizia's daughters six-year-old Leonor and Sofia - proudly wearing Spain football shirts - got to grips with the silverware at a reception given to the members of Spanish national team.

They were seen reaching deep inside the Euro trophy and pulled out what seemed to be confetti from celebrations in the Ukrainian capital Kiev.

The reception was held King Juan Carlos of Spain's La
 Zarzuela palace in Madrid and followed joyous scenes in the capital as 
thousands of people turned out for an open-top bus parade.

'Spaniards are proud of you, really proud, and not only because each of you are good players but because as a team you are terrific,' the 74-year-old monarch said as players gathered for a team photo.

'You have shown you can play and be good people, be good as a team, and that is thanks to you, to your knowledge, your skills and your determination,' he said in the gardens of Madrid's Palacio de la Zarzuela.

Having made light work of Italy in last night's final, Spain's all-conquering players had been quick to celebrate on the pitch as they paraded the trophy in front of thousands of jubilant fans.

The on-pitch celebrations were led by adorable two-year-old Nora Torres, the daughter of striker Fernando Torres, 28, who scored Spain's third goal in Kiev as the world champions cruised to an historic 4-0 victory.

And during the joyous scenes that followed, the striker's ponytailed little girl was joined by around a dozen other youngsters, as Spain's celebrations after the final whistle became a full-on family affair.

Several first team players, including 
goalscorer Torres, midfielder Xabi Alonso and goalkeeper Jose Reina let 
their young families join in the pitch celebrations, with the children 
appearing to enjoy the spectacle even more than their footballing 
fathers.

Torres's young son
 Leo and daughter Nora were among several kitted out in their miniature 
Spain replica shirts, toddling joyfully around the pitch and playing 
with glitter used during the trophy ceremony.

Likewise
 Spanish goalkeeper Jose Reina, although not used in the tournament, was
 another who took the chance to take in the winning moment with his 
family.

The Liverpool 
keeper was pictured soaking up the post-match atmosphere in Kiev with 
his two adorable daughters Grecia, five, Alma, three, and son Luca, one.

All the children invited on to the pitch did not appear overawed by the huge football stadium and crowd, and appeared happy just to play in the goalmouth and wander around enjoying the moment.

Reina's former Liverpool teammate Xabi Alonso, instrumental in Spain's historic tournament triumph, was another who revelled in victory in the company of his wife and children.

The midfielder, 30, posed for pictures with the trophy alongside wife Nagore Aramburu, son Jontxu and two-year-old daughter Ane.

As Spain celebrated becoming the first ever national team to win three consecutive major tournaments, their players appear to have achieved almost God-like status with their own fans.

Footage after the final whistle saw Spain fans even hand their own children to players like Torres during wild celebrations in the Kiev crowd.

The seemingly invincible Spanish were crowned Euro 2012 champions having won the World Cup in 2010 and winning Euro 2008.

Their victory saw football pundits compare Spain - who have not lost a competitive game since the 2010 World Cup - hailed as one of the best ever international football sides.
