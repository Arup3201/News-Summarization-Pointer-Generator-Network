Last month it was revealed that Pippa Middleton and boyfriend Nico Jackson were house-hunting for a south London home.

But it would seem that any plans for moving in will have to be put on hold - with a new job for the London-based broker set to take their relationship long distance.

Mr Jackson, who has been dating Miss Middleton for nearly two years, will be swapping the City for Switzerland next month, according to the Evening Standard. He is set to quit his job at Deutsche Bank to take on a new role at a multi-billion pound hedge fund in Geneva.

Long distance love: Mr Jackson, who has been dating Miss Middleton, 30, for eighteen months, is set to swap the City for Switzerland next month. He will leave his role at Deutsche Bank to join a Geneva hedge fund

Perfect match: The couple take in the action during the men's semi-finals at Wimbledon. Mr Jackson will join Jabre Capital, whose co-founders include Dr Mark Cecil - a close friend of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

Elegant: Engagement rumours first emerged after the pair, pictured at an event in November, took a romantic trip to India last year. The couple also holidayed with Mr Jackson's grandparents earlier this year

The move comes amid growing speculation that he and Miss Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's 30-year-old sister, are about to tie the knot.

In March the couple holidayed with Nico’s grandparents at luxury ski resort Lech in the Austrian Alps, as suspicions grew that an engagement may not be too far off.

And last week the couple looked very much in love as they watched the Wimbledon men's final alongside Miss Middleton parents, Carole and Michael.

The pair, who were seen chatting and sharing jokes in the stands at SW19, were first seen publicly together at a nightclub opening in 2012.

A source close to the couple told the Evening Standard that: 'They are very much an item, their relationship is very strong and they are very happy together.'

Mr Jackson, 36, is reportedly leaving his role as a stockbroker at Deutsche Bank to join £1.6billion fund Jabre Capital as an investment manager in Geneva.

Night out: The couple last May. Earlier this year Miss Middleton, who previously dated former England cricketer Alex Loudon, showed how serious she was about Mr Jackson by taking him to the wedding of a close friend

The fund 
was founded in 2006 and claims to offer 'a diversified range of 
investment management services and products... to a broad network of 
institutional and high net worth clients,' according to its website.

The
 fund's founding partners include Dr Mark Cecil, 55, an Old Harrovian 
who qualified as a doctor at St Thomas' Hospital in London before 
switching to finance.

He and his wife Katie, who writes about interiors and food for House & Garden magazine, hosted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at their Mustique villa.

Mrs Cecil cemented her ties with the Middleton family when she helped style Pippa's cult party planning book Celebrate.

Earlier this year Miss Middleton, who previously dated former England cricketer Alex Loudon, showed that she was serious about Mr Jackson by taking him to the wedding of one of her oldest friends.

Miss Middleton met Mr Jackson, who grew up in a red-bricked terraced house in Folkestone, while on a ski trip.

Deutsche Bank and Jabre Capital declined to comment when contacted by the Evening Standard.
