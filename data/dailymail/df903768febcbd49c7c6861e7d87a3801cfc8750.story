Manchester City reached the last 16 of the Champions League after goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta secured a 2-0 win at Roma in Group E. Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rated the players' performances on Wednesday night.

Manchester City (4-2-3-1)

Joe Hart 8

Point-blank block from Holebas set the tone for an outstanding display. Pick of the bunch was touching Manolas’s header against the post. 

Pablo Zabaleta 6

City’s Mr Reliable got a bit of a chasing at the hands of Gervinho but recovered and got forward to score the second goal. 

Manchester City keeper Joe Hart was in fine form to frustrate Roma on Wednesday night

Martin Demichelis 7

Came to the rescue with some vital clearances, not least when Destro had an open goal in the second half. 

Eliaquim Mangala 6.5

Won his battle with Totti to make sure the Roma legend didn’t repeat his heroics from the first game. 

Gael Clichy 6

Kept on his toes by Gervinho and Ljajic but did just about enough to quell the threat down City’s left.

Fernandinho 7

Made some excellent interceptions and got forward well in the absence of the suspended Yaya Toure. 

Fernando 6.5

Solid job as City’s midfield anchor, getting back on several occasions to bale out his back-four. 

Jesus Navas 6.5

City’s main threat down the right flank in the first half but had faded slightly by the time he was replaced by Silva. 

Samir Nasri scored a stunning goal to put Manchester City in control of the tie

Samir Nasri 7.5

Provided the all-important breakthrough with a stunning strike and then teed up the second for Zabaleta. 

James Milner 6.5

Lively throughout and it was his clever decoy run that created the extra space for Nasri to score. 

Edin Dzeko 5.5

Looked rusty on his first start in a month and turned a good first-half chance over the bar. No goal in 10 now. 

Martin Demichelis came to Citry's rescue with a clearance from Mattia Destro

Silva (for Navas 67, 6), Jovetic (for Dzeko 78, 6), Kolarov (for Nasri 89)

Manuel Pellegrini 8

To pull off this result without Aguero, Kompany and Toure, and Silva only half-fit, takes some doing. Deserves his place in the knockout stage with City for the second season in a row.

Referee

Milorad Mazic (Serbia) 7

Only big decision on the night was whether Zabaleta had tripped Gervinho in the penalty box. The Serbian got it right by ruling that the former Arsenal man had gone down too easily.
