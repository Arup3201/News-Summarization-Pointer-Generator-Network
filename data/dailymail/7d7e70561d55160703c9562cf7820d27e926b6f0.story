Neil Cleary, 64, who was arrested for looking at child porn told officers he did it because he was bored and miserable about being old

A grandfather charged with viewing child porn told police he did it because he was bored and fed up with being old.

Neil Cleary, 64, was arrested after police received a tip-off off that he was viewing indecent images of children on his work computer while employed at Denver International Airport.

After his arrest, Cleary confessed to police that he had a 'big problem' with pornography, adding that he viewed the images at work when he got bored, and at home because 'getting old sucks'.

After officers seized Cleary's home computer they found cartoon images of children having sex 
with adults, and pictures of girls between the age of 7 and 16 posed in 
sexually suggestive positions.

According to the affidavit, police also found a number of saved searches on his work browser history 'indicative of pornography websites involving children.'

Cleary told investigators that the images he viewed were nude modeling pictures of children, rather than indecent sexual acts.

He viewed the images while working as contract compliance representative for the airport, where he resigned in January.

Cleary was charged with felony sexual exploitation of a child and has been released on $5,000 bail ahead of a court appearance on July 3.

Police were tipped off to Cleary's activities by security staff at Denver International Airport where he worked who told investigators he was looking at indecent pictures on his computer
