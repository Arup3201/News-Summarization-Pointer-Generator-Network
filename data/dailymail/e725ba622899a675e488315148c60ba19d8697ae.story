It's among the church's most illuminating traditions, one which kicks off the countdown to Christmas.

And despite the annual Advent event at Salisbury Cathedral being steeped in history, the crowds still flock to see its 'Darkness to Light' procession.

At the beginning of the service, the 750-year old building is shrouded in darkness and silence, lit only by a single Advent candle.

The medieval interior spectacularly comes to life as the cathedral choir march through the aisles brandishing almost 1,300 flickering candles.

These stunning pictures show the dramatic effect created by the candles as they pass through the congregation on Friday evening.

The procession is one of the highlights of the year, and draws huge numbers of worshipers, who are treated to music conducted by David Halls.

Mr Halls, the cathedral's director of 
music, said: 'The music, sung by the cathedral choir, is in perfect 
keeping with the feeling of expectation that underpins Advent.

'This is all in contrast to the great Advent hymns sung by a capacity congregation of over seventeen hundred on all three evenings, and sounding truly magnificent.

'There is a great feeling of momentum as the service reaches its climax.'

The final nights of the procession will take place on Sunday, the official beginning of Advent.
