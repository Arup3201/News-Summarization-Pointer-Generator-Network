The family of a baby girl who was mauled to death by their banned American pit bull paid the 'ultimate price' for owning a dangerous dog, an inquest has heard.

The six-month-old baby, named today as Molly-Mae Wotherspoon, died from blood loss 12 days ago after sustaining severe head wounds in the fatal attack at her mother's home in Daventry .  

Today, senior coroner for Northamptonshire Anne Pember issued a stern warning about keeping dogs banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act, saying Molly-Mae's family had 'paid the ultimate price' for doing so.

Claire Riley spoke out in 2012 about her 'absolutely crazy' Bull Terrier Pups, who she said wreaked £1,500 worth of damage in her home. Her six-month old daughter Molly-Mae Wotherspoon was mauled to death by the family's American pit bull earlier this month

Ms Riley said she 'hoped things would change' but that she had tried everything to calm her dog down. It is not known whether Pups is the dog which mauled Molly-Mae to death

She said: 'I understand the family owned the American pit bull terrier who attacked Molly-Mae.

'The public should be aware that this breed is classified under the Dangerous Dogs Act for a reason - its dangerousness.

'The family in this case have paid the ultimate price for owning such a dog - the death of their six-month-old baby.' 

Two years ago, Molly-Mae's mother Claire Riley spoke to MailOnline about one of her dogs, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, who she said was 'absolutely crazy'. 

She told how Pups wreaked £1,500 worth of damage at her home by destroying two laptops, a mobile phone, TV wires and even an armchair. She said she 'hoped things would change'. 

It is not known if Pups was the dog that attacked Ms Riley's daughter. 

Molly-Mae was attacked on Friday, October 3 while she was being looked after by her grandmother Susan, 54, at their three-bedroom house.

Her grandmother - who was minding the child while Ms Riley popped out - also sustained injuries trying to fight off the dog.

Two years ago, Ms Riley revealed how one of her dogs had caused havoc in her home by destroying her armchair (left) and sofa (right) and she could not leave it alone for more than 30 minutes

Officers and paramedics rushed to the scene, where they attempted to resuscitate the baby.

Molly-Mae was taken to Northampton General Hospital where she was confirmed dead. The dog was put down at the scene.  

After the attack, Northamptonshire Police confirmed the dog was an American pit bull, a breed which has been banned in the UK since the early 90s.

The family is understood to have owned two dogs, both said to be pit bulls. One neighbour called them 'devil dogs' because they were always barking and fighting each other. 

During her interview in 2012, Ms Riley told how her 11-month-old Staffie was so hyper that she was unable to leave her home for more than 30 minutes in case she started eating her valuables.

She said at the time: 'She is absolutely crazy. Pups is the cutest thing ever when I'm around but if I even leave the room she goes nuts. 

The fatal attack took place in Daventry, in the home where the baby lived with her mother and grandmother, the inquest was told

'She has destroyed my home. I have had to fit two new kitchen cupboard doors. It has cost me an absolute fortune, at least £1,500.'

Ms Riley also told how she also spent £140 on a dog whisperer to see if he could stop Pups wrecking her home. But he told her the dog was beyond help. 

She added: 'Nothing works. He could not recommend any techniques. Hopefully age will slow her down. 

'I just have to keep shouting at her and hope one day she will listen. It is hard work. I am housebound with her.

'I have come this far with her. I hand reared her with a bottle. I don't want to give up on her now.

'I'm still hoping things will change. Until then I just have to hide my laptop and phone and hope she grows out of it.'  

Molly-Mae was taken to Northampton General Hospital after sustaining severe head wounds but could not be saved

Friends said Ms Riley, who lived with her mother and daughter in the terraced house, was considering giving up her two dogs but kept them for protection.

One said: 'I know she had called police to her house. You can still see the broken window.She promised me she'd get rid of the dogs. She said she'd give them to her brothers.'

A couple that live on the same street say neighbours had reported the dogs to Daventry District Council on multiple occasions but nothing had been done.  

Daventry District Council said they were called to the property in May this year after receiving a complaint from a neighbour about the dogs. It said no further action was taken.  

In a statement released by police, the family said they were 'totally devastated' by what had happened.

It said: 'The family wish to say at this point that we are totally devastated and in complete shock for the tragic loss of our little princess and ask that we are left alone to grieve at this horrific time.' 

Speaking at a press conference in Northampton after the girl's death, Chief Inspector Tom Thompson had said the victim's life had been 'tragically taken away in the most horrific of circumstances.' 

Neighbours lay floral tributes at the house, following the young girl's death

He said: 'The baby girl was confirmed dead shortly after the attack at her mother's home in Morning Star Road on the Timken estate.

'At the time of the attack, she was being cared for by her maternal grandmother who suffered bite injuries attempting to protect the baby. The dog was destroyed by vets at the scene.

'Subsequently a post-mortem was carried out at the Royal Veterinary College with the assistance of dog legislation officers from this force and elsewhere.

'This was done to determine the breed of the dog responsible for the fatal attack

'We can reveal the outcome of that post mortem has shown the dog was an American pit bull, a prohibited breed under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act.'  

Mr Thompson had refused to be drawn on whether anyone had been arrested in connection with potential offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act, which makes it illegal to own, breed, sell or trade American pit bulls.

The officer said: 'Extensive inquiries are taking place to ascertain if any offences have occurred.

The incident took place in Morning Star Road on October 3.  Police have referred the circumstances of the death to a serious case review committee

'This continues to be a complex and highly unusual investigation which has required significant resource within force and drawn on national expertise in the area of dangerous dogs.

'But at the heart of it is a baby girl whose life has tragically been taken away in the most horrific of circumstances.

'In addition to our ongoing investigation, we have been concentrating our efforts on providing support for a grieving family who have been left devastated by this.

'The family have made it very clear that they do not want us to name their child. We must remember that they're grieving, they're in shock.

'They have lost a child in the most tragic circumstances and we really must respect their wishes.'  

It is understood the force have dealt with 62 instances of attacks involving dogs in the past two years.

Police have referred the circumstances of the death to a serious case review committee, which will meet next month to consider whether it should be investigated by Northamptonshire's Safeguarding Children Board. 

The tragedy has sparked calls for new, tougher rules to be put in place to prevent potentially dangerous dogs from being housed in family homes.  

Dog owners in Britain used to be required to have a licence but they were widely ignored and eventually abolished in 1987. 

New laws introduced in May can see owners of a dangerous dog jailed for up to 14 years if their pet gets past them.  

Also, the new laws enable police to prosecute the owners of dangerous dogs even if the attack happened in their own home. 

Since 2005, at least 20 people have died in dog attacks across Britain.   

The coroner adjourned the inquest until February 11 next year and released Molly-Mae's body to her family. 

Mrs Pember gave the provisional cause of Molly-Mae's death as exsanguination from injuries sustained in a dog attack.

During the two-minute hearing at Northampton General Hospital, Coroner for Northamptonshire, Ms Pember said the baby's body had been identified by Molly-Mae's mother.
