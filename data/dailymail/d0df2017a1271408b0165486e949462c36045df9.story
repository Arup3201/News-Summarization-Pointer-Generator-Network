Stepping down: New UKIP councillor Eric Kitson won a seat in Stourport, Worcestershire less than two weeks ago but will quit over a series of anti-Muslim, anti-Jewish Facebook posts

A UKIP councillor has announced he will probably have to step down after less than two weeks because he posted a series of offensive messages about Jews and Muslims online.

Eric Kitson, 59, has admitted 'I don't see how I can possibly carry on' after sharing racist cartoons and messages on Facebook.

One included a picture of a nuclear weapon exploding emblazoned with the message: 'Some cancers need to be treated with radiation, Islam is one of them'.

He also shared an image of a Muslim being roasted over a pile of burning Korans, as well as several anti-Semitic outbursts linking the Rothschild banking dynasty to Adolf Hitler.

In one comment he said in reference to Muslim women: 'Hang um all first then ask questions later.'

The councillor from Stourport, Worcestershire, has apologised to residents and party colleagues for his 'stupid' actions.

But he denied being racist and claimed he had shared the material to expose the 'unacceptable' views they contained.

He said: 'I thought I could handle politics, but I can't - I don't see how I can possibly carry on.

'I'm not a racist, all my friends know me better than that.

'What I wrote was stupid, but it wasn't racist. I am not racist. I'm the only white guy on my local five-a-side football team.

'I wanted to show people this is bad, this is wrong. What I should have done is write something on them about how bad it is but I didn't.

'To say I have been stupid is mild.

'I do not agree with the comments and I have not got a racist bone in my body. I went to school with a lot of young Pakistanis and Indians and I have had wonderful Muslim friends over the years.'

Kitson, who joined UKIP a year ago, also apologised to his colleagues.

He said: 'What can I say to them? The hardest thing to do is say sorry.

Upsetting: Kitson shared this picture originally from a supporters group of Dutch politician Geert Wilders

'The people who know me - my family, friends, people I work with - have all supported me.

'It has made me ill - I cannot eat and I cannot sleep.'

Kitson made a string of posts relating to Muslims and other ethnic groups.

In another he called for a referendum to set up an English parliament, Britain's withdrawal from the European Union and the repatriation of 'six million migrants and refugees'.

Kitson was elected to Worcestershire County Council less than two weeks ago.

He received 1,385 votes to take the Wyre Forest seat on May 2 - beating rivals from the three mainstream political groups.

UKIP said it is currently investigating the posts.

A spokesman for UKIP said: 'We are aware of the incidents and we launched our investigation earlier this week.

'But until we have come to a full conclusion and we are satisfied our investigation is complete Eric will remain in his post.'

West Mercia Police confirmed they have requested more information in relation to the incident.
