Canadians have been left confused over the country's new $20-dollar bill which some have said appeared to feature three naked woman and the World Trade Center towers. 

The government was rolling out the new banknote as part of an upgrade of the monetary system. It actually features the Vimy Memorial in northern France, the largest monument overseas for Canadian soldiers lost the First World War.

However many Canadians believed the bill showed the Twin Towers and three topless women along with the head of state, Queen Elizabeth II.

O Canada! The new $20 banknote  was said to be 'too pornographic' by some focus groups because it featured the naked figures representing Justice, Peace and Hope on the WWI memorial in France (right)

The Vimy Memorial, a nationalist symbol of bravery and sacrifice, was seen on the $20 when it was unveiled by the Bank of Canada in Ottawa last week. 

Focus groups, typically made up of a wide-range of citizens from different generations, had examined the note before it was made public.

According to Upi.com, one focus group member said: 'It's too pornographic. What is the woman on the top holding?'

Several reports made public after the five-year consultation period noted this concern along with others under the headline 'potential controversies'.

Some participants in the focus groups were unaware of the wartime memorial honoring thousands of Canadian servicemen, in particular forgotten soldiers with unmarked graves.

Several said the drawing reminded them of the Twin Towers, destroyed in the terrorist attacks on 9/11.

'I wonder if the monument here could conjure up memories of 9/11 or the Twin Towers,' one person in Toronto said.

In fact, the two columns of the Vimy 
Memorial symbolise the unity of France and Canada - represented by a 
maple leaf and fleur-de-lis.

The group of women at the top of the 
statue are known as the Chorus. The most senior figures represent 
Justice and Peace - the latter with a torch upraised.

The figures of Hope, Charity, Honour 
and Faith are located below Justice and Peace. Truth and Knowledge are 
positioned on the Western side.

The new $20 bill is due to come into 
circulation in November and has a high-tech polymer design. The note is 
currently the most counterfeited in circulation, accounting for 
more than half the bills in exchange.

The
 new method of manufacturing the $20 should make the note more difficult
 to reproduce, authorities said and last twice as long as paper notes.
