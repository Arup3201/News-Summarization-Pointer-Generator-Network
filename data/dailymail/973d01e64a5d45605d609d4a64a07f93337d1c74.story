Guilty: Ashley Clark, 23, was jailed for 21 months at Burnley Crown Court following a series of drunken incidents after his discharge from the Army

A soldier who was brain damaged in an explosion in Afghanistan that a court heard killed two of his comrades has been jailed after a series of drunken offences.

Ashley Clark, 23, who served with the 2nd Battalion of the Duke of Lancaster’s regiment, started drinking to 'self-medicate' after seeing his friends fatally wounded.

Captain Andrew Griffiths, 25, and Kingsman Darren Deady, 22, died within weeks of the explosion, the court heard, while Clark was left with 'life changing injuries' and was forced to leave the Army.

Burnley Crown Court heard how Clark, now a web designer, found it very difficult to cope with civilian life and - even though he had recently started to tackle his problems - Judge Andrew Woolman said it was too late in the day. 

Clark had lost his temper and racially abused a taxi driver, ranting and swearing and calling him a terrorist, in the early hours of July 25 last year.

He had then kicked off when police arrived, struggling with them, biting a female officer on the arm and booting her colleague in the shin. 

Three months later, he was arrested again for being drunk and disorderly.

During the deferment period, Clark had been one of two people involved in a sustained attack, again on a taxi driver, who was punched and subjected to a number of kicks after he was knocked to the ground.

The victim suffered a cut to his bottom lip and grazing to his eye, knee and elbow after the outburst in March. 

The hearing was told how the defendant had had a sentence deferred by the judge last December - giving Clark a chance to improve his behaviour.

But his problems continued and he has now been jailed.  

All the offences were committed during a suspended sentence for a burglary he had carried out on his aunt and uncle’s farmhouse in nearby Rossendale.

Clark’s barrister said he had recently attended an alcohol treatment course and had made good progress. He did receive some counselling and had made positive changes in his life, but clearly needed help.

The former soldier was jailed for 21 months. He had admitted racially aggravated threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, two counts of police assault, being drunk and disorderly and common assault and was in breach of the suspended term. He has 11 offences on his record.

Judge Woolman told Clark he had deferred sentence partly because of his 'horrific experience' in Afghanistan when Clark was in a vehicle which was blown up and witnessed the death of two fellow soldiers.

The court heard how Clark turned to drinking to self-medicate following his medical discharge from the Army - leading to a number of drunken incidents, including racially abusing a taxi driver 

The judge said: 'I had no doubt that all that was having a considerable impact upon your behaviour. I thought there was a chance that if I gave you another opportunity you might sort yourself out. That would have been to everybody’s benefit.

'I gave you a chance on December 13 and nobody could say that you have taken it. I said you had got to keep away from alcohol and seek help and go to Salute and other organisations, although belatedly you might have done. When you left court on December 13, that was your last chance.

'I recognise to an extent I am undoing the good work you have now started and it may set you back, but you have only yourself to blame.'

The incident that killed Captain Griffiths, and injured Clark was featured in a BBC Three documentary Our War in 2012.

It featured uncensored footage captured on the helmet cameras of comrades during a daring three-day operation, codenamed Hornet’s Nest, when troops were sent deep into enemy territory in Helmand Province.

While the above story is an accurate report of the court proceedings, the Ministry of Defence has asked us to clarify the facts concerning the deaths of Kingsman Darren Deady and Captain Andrew Griffiths in Afghanistan.  It states: ‘Kingsman Deady was shot defending a compound in Helmand Province on 23 August 2010 and died of his wounds on 10 September at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.  Capt Griffiths was injured by an improvised explosive device inside a compound on 24 August 2010 while leading his troops on patrol in Helmand.  He died of his wounds on 5 September 2010 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. ’
