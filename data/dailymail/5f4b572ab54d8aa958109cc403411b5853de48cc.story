Cheat: Susan Elaine Flanagan, 56, claimed £138,000 from the UK taxpayer despite living in Tunisia

A mother fraudulently raked in more than £138,000 from the UK taxpayer - while living in Tunisia with her two youngest children.

Susan Elaine Flanagan, 56, even set up a blog called 'A Brit making a life in Tunisia', posting about a catering business she had set up.

Flanagan claimed the benefits between May 2006 and November 2012 on the basis she was living in Prenton, Wirral, even though she had moved her family to the north African country.

She claimed Income Support, Child Benefit and Disability Living Allowance in the UK - and later made additional claims for Employment Support Allowance and Child Tax Credit.

After suspicions were raised in 2012 following a tip-off and her benefits were stopped, she returned to the UK and was arrested.

Investigations showed she had taken her children out of school in 2006 - but when confronted over the blog posts she initially claimed they were 'a figment of her imagination', and said the content couldn't be relied upon.

Flanagan insisted she only spent eight to 12 weeks at a time in Tunisia where she rented a property and denied doing anything wrong.

It was only after lengthy investigations, carried out by the Department of Work and Pensions, which included translating stamps on her passport from Arabic and going through her bank account transactions - that she finally admitted her crimes.

Flanagan has now pleaded guilty to five offences of failing to notify a change of circumstance and failing to disclose information.

At Liverpool Crown Court on Friday, Philip Astbury, defending, said his client had not been living the 'life of Riley' in Africa.

But Kevin Slack, prosecuting, said money goes a lot further in Tunisia than in Britain, adding that her blog suggested she ate out at restaurants, had people entertaining at her home and was living 'an enjoyable lifestyle'.

The court heard Ms Flanagan - who arrived in a mobility scooter - began making legitimate benefit claims in 1993, including disability living allowance on the grounds she had extensive mobility restrictions.

But they became fraudulent in 2006 when she took her two children out of school and moved from her home to start a new life in Monastir, Tunisia.

Mr Slack said that over the following six-and-a-half years she continued living in Africa, with a pattern of spending several months to a year there at a time, with occasional return visits to her Prenton home, usually for a week or two before flying back out to Tunisia.

In 2009 she submitted a claim for child tax benefit, filling in a form saying she lived in the UK.

Two years later an Income Support review form was filled in to allow her to continue claiming, which the prosecution said appeared to have been completed by someone else at her request as she was in Tunisia at the time.

In early 2012, Flanagan submitted a further form for Employment Support Allowance, on which she gave her Prenton address but declined to provide a mobile number - and also requested three weeks notice for any face-to-face assessment.

Mr Slack said: 'She said she would need that time for a carer to accompany her to an interview. The crown suggests that was to allow her time to come back from Tunisia.'

Defending, Mr Astbury said it was an 'unusual' case as she would have been entitled to those benefits if she had been living in the UK, and said it hadn't been a cynical and calculated plan but something she fell into and let continue.

He said his client was a woman of previous good character who was remorseful, and said that due to her chronic medical condition a custodial sentence would be difficult to deal with.

Sentencing, Recorder Paul Reid QC said Flanagan had chosen to abuse the system and enjoy that lifestyle choice with the assistance of benefits she was receiving in the UK, and said the picture her blog painted was of an enjoyable life in Tunisia.

Rejecting the possibility of a suspended sentence, he jailed her for 12 months, reduced from 16 for her guilty pleas. She was also ordered to pay back £4,000, the only amount available for confiscation, within two months.
