Milkman David Reid, 71, ran down a cyclist when driving his float on the wrong side of the road and then carried on his round saying he had customers to serve, Burnley Crown Court heard

A 71-year-old milkman who ran down a cyclist when driving his float on the wrong side of the road carried on his round saying 'they are dangerous' and he had customers to serve.

David Reid stopped briefly to check on Royal Navy submariner Paul Reynolds, 36, as he lay injured in the road before getting back into his vehicle and telling a teenage passenger: 'I think he's dead.'

He then delivered milk to four houses before eventually going to a post office to raise the alarm - but made 15 more deliveries before returning to scene of the crash in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.

Today, Reid was fined £3,000 and given a 70 day suspended sentence plus 70 hours unpaid work after he was convicted of careless driving at Burnley Crown Court.

He was found not guilty of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by a jury at an earlier hearing, but was handed 10 penalty points for failing to report an accident.

Mr Reynolds, 36, who was cycling to his naval base at the time of the crash, was in a coma for six months and has been left permanently disabled.

He suffered severe head injuries and multiple fractures to his pelvis in the accident on February 27 last year and requires two carers round the clock in a nursing home.

Reid, who has worked as a milkman for 50 years, was driving on the wrong side of the road at 8mph when he crashed head on into Mr Reynolds, causing the submariner to smash into the windscreen.

The 36-year-old was thrown on to a grass verge several metres away and his bike was left entangled in the railings.

A 15-year-old schoolboy who was travelling with Reid told an earlier trial: 'Dave got out to see if he was alright, he said hello to him and he came back and said to me 'I think he's dead'.

'He kept saying 'What do I do?' and then he went 'Cyclists, they are dangerous on the road - they do not pay attention.' '

Mr Guy Mathieson prosecuting said: 'The collision caused the cyclist to propel up into the air seemingly striking his head on the windscreen. He was left on the grass verge the bike left entangled in the railings.

'Mr Reid found him unconscious and unresponsive. But rather than alerting the authorities he carried on with his milk round. He said that he had to in effect, because, 'I have customers that I can't let down'.

'He stopped at a local post office about 6.15am 10 minutes after the accident happened. He alerted the person at the post office and gave details of where and what had happened but didn't leave any of his own details and left instructions that the person at the post office phone the police. 

'He then finished the round and completing the day's work.

Reid was fined £3,000 and given a 70 days suspended sentence plus 70 hours unpaid work after he was convicted of careless driving 

'Members of the public came across the scene and found Mr Reynolds in the position he was in and attended to him.'

Mr Reynold's parents John and Margaret whose younger son Carl died in 1994 from leukaemia said they had to travel 120 miles a day to sit with their son at his bedside for five hours each day.

His mother described herself as 'heartbroken and his father 'a broken man'.

Reid insisted he had been driving carefully and claimed the impact occurred when he had started to make a right turn on an unlit street he likened to 'a black hole.'

He added: 'There was a whoosh across the front of my screen. I didn't know what it was. I heard a bang.

'I said to him 'can you hear me?' a few times. There was no response. He was just lying there. I didn't dare touch him. I went back to the van and as I did that I looked around to see if any house lights were on. There was only one about twenty yards away, but it only had a sort of landing light.'

Speaking at Burnley Crown Court, Judge Graham Knowles QC told Reid: 'You drove into a head on collision with Paul Reynolds who was on his way to serve Queen and country as a submariner'

Reid said he went to the Post Office to call for help because he did not have a mobile phone.

After going to the post office and asking someone to ring the emergency services he was in a 'confused' state of mind and made fifteen more milk deliveries before dropping off his young helper.

He said: 'It isn't in my nature at all to be callous. I was driving as I normally drive and that is careful'.

His counsel Mr Richard Vardon said: 'He still can't understand why he behaved in the way he did after the accident. He is at a total loss as to what was going through his mind.'

But Judge Graham Knowles QC told Reid: 'You drove into a head on collision with Paul Reynolds who was on his way to serve Queen and country as a submariner. You exited, checked Mr Reynolds, you thought he was dead. You went on your delivery before doing anything to help. He was alive but catastrophically injured.

'You drove on the right hand side of the road and oncoming traffic could have no view of you until a late stage. It boarded on in my view the dangerous. This is a bad case but so far as harm goes it is one of the worst. I'm sure your driving was a cause of his injuries, true was he did not have lights on, no high visibility wear - but your driving was a cause of the collision.

'The fine - that is the only sentence I can impose - is not and could not be a measured of the valuation of the harm done and grief caused on that February morning.'
