Sculpted with mud into dramatic horn shapes or intricately braided and covered with hundreds of brightly coloured beads - the eye-catching hairstyles worn by the tribal women of Angola are practically works of art.

Bursting with colour and decorated with beaded diamond and bow shapes, buttons and shells, the fascinating styles are the result of thousands of years of tradition.

Mario Gerth, 38, from Erfurt, Germany, captured the images when he travelled to the African nation, which shares a southern border with Namibia.

The banker and photographer says: 'African hairstyles are ever-changing, yet deeply rooted in a shared past stemming from tribal traditions.

'Every tribe has its own style, and then within one tribe we can find even more styles - for men, woman, children, for those who have been widowed, and many more.

'Hairdressing in Africa is always the work of trusted friends or relatives.

'Hair in the hands of an enemy is believed to become an ingredient in the production of a dangerous "medicine" that would injure the owner.

'I found this aspect very interesting.'

Travelling to southern Angola, Mario visited the Mumuhuila and Mucawana tribes and was able to photograph a collection of different hairstyles.

The women he pictured are known to spend several hours each morning making themselves as beautiful as possible, and their first task is to take care of their hair.

Mario says: 'Using elements such as butter, oil, cow dung and herbs, these fascinating women can create a style out of almost everything.

'Beads, shells and colours from stones help them to create their masterpieces.

'For example, the Mumuhuila people of Angola use mud in their hair to imitate stiff horns.'

Gerth admits to being fascinated by the 'inexhaustible wealth' of hairstyles that 'know no limits' in their elegance.

'Upon seeing my pictures people start thinking about their own hair,' he says.

'They think about things, like what is it telling the world, such as: "can I transfer a message with my own hairstyle?"'
