Reality TV star, fashion face, fake tan ambassador, PETA campaigner and style blogger... is there anything Lucy Watson can't do? Apparently not.

The Made In Chelsea star has unveiled the latest items in her jewellery collection, Creature, which she says is her absolute passion - and already has an army of famous fans.

Animal lover Lucy was inspired by nature and her surroundings growing up on a farm in Surrey. Fittingly, she called on her pet pooch, Digby, who also stars on Made In Chelsea, to model the range.

Who needs models? Animal lover Lucy was inspired by nature when designing her range and called on her pet pooch, Digby, who also stars on Made In Chelsea, to show off the range

Involved in a number of activities for the prevention of cruelty to animals, including a recent global PETA campaign, Lucy, 24, wanted to create a brand that stayed true to her ideals and allowed people to share her passion for animals.

The collection is made from sterling silver and gold plate and features a range of products, including tiger teeth shaped earrings, a snake fang motif ring, and Lucy's favourite: earrings that look like shark jaws.

Speaking about her latest project, which ranges in price from £40-£150, she said: 'I wanted to invest my time into a brand that I truly believed in.

First time around: The collection is made from sterling silver and gold plate and Lucy, seen modelling her first collection, said this venture is her absolute passion

'It was really important for me to feel passionately about this project, as I am committed to making it a successful range, that I will endeavour to work on for the foreseeable future.

'I have always been an animal lover, and I thought it was the perfect way to bridge the gap between fashion and animals, making high quality, affordable jewellery, inspired by something I am legitimately interested in.' 

Speaking at the time of launch, Lucy's management said: 'Lucy has been planning Creature for over a year now. She re-did the designs again and again, and has used local manufactures in London to ensure quality and control.

Dream come true: When Lucy first unveiled the range earlier this year, she said it was really important for her to feel passionately about this project because she wants it to grow and grow. She can already count Rita Ora, right, as a fan 

'Lucy has been involved in every process, and has invested money she has saved into the business. At heart, Lucy is a savvy business woman, and she wants to create a viable business for her to run, as she knows that the opportunities she has now may not always be available to her.' 

Lucy's career has sky-rocketed since joining the hit show. She was recently unveiled as the face - and smooth legs - of Wilkinson Sword, the face of Skinny Tan, as well as Lipsy VIP and has her own book, The Dating Game.

The Made In Chelsea regular - whose sibling Tiff has recently joined the E4 cast - looked glamorous as she attended the launch of Very.co.uk's Christmas pop-up shop on Thursday night.
