A builder was stunned to receive a parking ticket - after a bus stop was painted around his truck.

Steve Hall, 44, parked his pick-up in Bath, Somerset, at 6.40am but returned later to find yellow lines painted around it and a £35 fine stuck to his windscreen.

Unbeknown to him, pranksters had removed a series of cones marking out a stretch of road where council contractors were due to outline the new bus stop.

Fined: Steve Hall returned to his pick up truck in Bath to find that contractors had painted a bus stop around it and a parking fine attached to his windscreen

Discovery: A prankster had removed cones from the stretch of road where council contractors were due to mark out the bus stop

Bizarre: Mr Hall, who works for a building company, said the contractors even left paint on his tyres as they painted round the vehicle

Mr Hall, of Corsham, Wiltshire, said: 'I parked there as normal in the morning, and there were no signs out. I just couldn't believe it when I got back to my truck.

'I have never had a parking ticket in my life. It is not as though I just go around parking anywhere thinking I can get away with it.'

Mr Hall, who works for a building company, said the contractors even left paint on his tyres as they painted close to the vehicle.

His partner Gemma Aplin said: 'At first we thought it was a joke, like someone messing around. We usually leave our truck there and walk into town, as there is nowhere to park in the city centre.'

Comical: The yellow lines stop at the wheel of the car and are then continued at the other side

Shock: Mr Hall said he could not believe what he found when he returned to his vehicle

Luckily Bath and North East Somerset Council says it will quash the ticket if Steve appeals.A council spokesman said: 'The ticket should not have been issued. It will be rescinded upon appeal from Mr Hall.

'Our contractors checked that the area was coned-off in the evening to allow work to take place the following day.

'They were removed by a member of the public. Regarding the tyres, if Mr Hall writes to us with details we will raise [it] with our contractors and investigate.'
