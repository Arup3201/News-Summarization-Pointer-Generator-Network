A woman who has spent all her life being petrified of spiders finally overcame her fears today on live TV.

Donna Rees had been terrified of the eight-legged creatures since the age of three - and admits she went to extreme lengths to avoid them.

As well as nearly crashing her car after seeing a spider, she also dragged strangers into the house to remove them and ran into the street in her nightwear after discovering one.

Donna Rees had been terrified of spiders all her life until today - but thanks to celebrity psychotherapists Nik and Eva Speakman, she is now fine

In the space of an hour, Mrs Rees went from barely being able to look at a spider to holding  one

She told ITV's This Morning: 'The phobia has affected my whole life.'

But today, the curse was finally lifted after she received therapy on the show.

Thanks to the help of celebrity psychotherapists Nik and Eva Speakman, Mrs Rees went from barely being able to look at a spider to holding a huge tarantula.

The couple say their unique brand of therapy encourages people to confront patterns or beliefs set in their childhoods.

Indeed, Mrs Rees explained her phobia began at the age of three, when she woke from a nightmare. 'I came out of the bedroom and my grandma was there, screaming at a big spider on the wall.

'The stage was set from then - and I have feared them my whole life.'

When asked by presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden how she felt physically when she saw a spider, she said: 'Things go into slow motion. It's real fear, like someone is stood there with a knife or a gun.

'I need to run and get away - I have heart palpitations, my heart is beating with sheer panic.'

She added it took years for her to even say the word 'spider'.

Before she was cured, Donna nearly crashed her car after seeing a spider, dragged strangers into the house to remove them and ran into the street in her nightwear after discovering one 

'I could never deal with one in the house - I check clothes before I put them on, and I'm always afraid to sit on the floor.

'When my husband Kev is on nights, rather than get home and do the things I want to do, I go straight to bed, wrap myself in a sheet and turn the lights out. 

'I know it's ridiculous but couldn't bear it if I saw one in the house.'

She has even swerved into oncoming traffic after noticing a spider in the car.

'It was lucky it was night time,' she recalled. 'There was a petrol tanker coming towards me - had it not had its lights on, I may not have seen it and swerved out of the way in time.

'Another time I ran out of my house in my nightdress, stopped a complete stranger in a car and dragged him in the house to come and get rid of the spider.

'I looked like a complete lunatic.' 

Before the show, Donna sat with the Speakmans, who tested just how terrified she was of spiders by wiring her up to a heart monitor and showing her images. At the beginning of the session, her heart rate was 92

But after being shown two pictures of a spider, her heart rate shot up to 145 and she became tearful 

Nik and Eva Speakman are celebrity psychotherapists who made their fortune with a successful financial services company, before reinventing themselves as life coaches to the rich and famous.

They say their goal is to ‘help people live a happier and more fulfilled life’ using their brand of therapy, in which they encourage people to confront patterns or beliefs developed in childhood.

Their curious treatments include seating patients in the back of a vintage DeLorean sports car, so that they can travel 'back to the future' to confront past demons.

‘If you weren’t born with an issue, you can change a behaviour for the better’, Eva Speakman says of the therapy.

To help with a phobia, they identify the fear that has been blown out of proportion, and ‘re-programme’ so they understand they have made up the fear.

Nik Speakman adds: ‘The big thing with a phobia is that it’s something that you’ve made up.

‘What we do is make people realise they’ve made it up, and we make something else up and take them back to where they were. Because no one is born with a phobia.

‘It’s a complete re-programming of the brain.’

Former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona solicited their services, and they have also helped Coronation Street actress Kym Marsh, who credits the Speakmans' therapy with curing her phobia of motorway driving.

Camelot has hired them to counsel National Lottery winners about how to deal with new-found wealth. 

More recently, they helped The Only Way Is Essex Star Sam Faiers get over a condition which saw her pull out her own eyelashes.

Nik Speakman told the programme: 'No one is born with a phobia - it is a learned behaviour. 

'In Donna's case, she had a nightmare, woke up, saw her nan screaming, looked at why and saw a spider. 

'In that moment, she made the association.'

Before the show, Donna sat with the Speakmans, who tested just how terrified she was of spiders.

Despite declaring that on a scale of one to 10, she was a 10, they wanted to check scientifically by wiring her up to a heart monitor.

At the beginning of the session, her heart rate was 92. 

But after being shown two pictures of a spider, her heart rate shot up to 135 and then 145.

As a spider was brought out to her in a glass case, Donna began to look extremely uncomfortable and tearful.

Shaking with fear, she admitted: 'I feel like crying. But I really want it [the problem] to stop.'

However just 60 minutes later, Donna was back in the studio, appearing calm and composed. 

The Speakmans told an astounded Phillip and Amanda the secret had been changing the concept of a spider in Donna's head.

They explained that as a young child, she had heard her grandmother scream and blamed the spider.

'But I now know it wasn't the spider's fault, it was Nan,' she said. 

'She's the one who screamed with fear, I should have had a phobia of her.

'In the moment, I made the wrong choice - the spider didn't do anything.'

She added she was grateful she had managed not to pass on her phobia to her son.  

As a test, she was then shown the pictures of the spiders again, while wired up to the heart rate monitor.

This time, it remained a steady 97 beats per minute - even when the glass cabinet containing the spider was brought into the studio.

Then, to everyone's astonishment, she put her hand in the cabinet and tried to fish the spider out with her fingers. 

She agreed that even an hour before, she wouldn't have dreamed such a situation to be possible.

Laughing, she said: 'Normally by now, you would just see the back of me.'

When asked if she was scared of the spider in her hands, she said: 'No, it's liberating, a miracle.

'My family won't believe it's me. They'll think "it looks like Donna, but it can't be".'
