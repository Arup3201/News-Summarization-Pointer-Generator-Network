The mother of missing teenager Abigail Hernandez has revealed that revealed that she prefers to spend her time sleeping - as then she dreams of her daughter and only when she wakes, does the nightmare return.

Zenya Hernandez spoke to ABC about her missing 15-year-old after the girl vanished on October 9, two months ago today, from her home in New Hampshire. 

It was revealed last week that the family received a glimmer of hope after Abby wrote and posted them a letter in the weeks after her disappearance. However the letter has so far produced no leads. Authorities revealed few details about it out of fear of copycats who would hamper the investigation.

Speaking about her missing daughter, Mrs Hernandez told ABC on Monday: 'It was really numbing for the first three weeks, four weeks then I received a letter and it was exhilarating.'

'I went from constantly thinking what 
could have happened and going through every scenario in my head 
non-stop, to thinking OK, now there's hope. We are just praying that some miracle happens.

Mrs Hernandez added: 'A lot of people say I'm living the worst thing that a parent can live through which is very hard. But I'm relieved every day that we don't have bad news. I'll never stop looking and I'll never lose hope.'

Abigail Hernandez wrote her mother a letter postmarked October 23 that was received by the family on November 6.

Officials
delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed
in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager. Law enforcement officials say that although the letter has given them fresh hope, they fear deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety.

Zenya Hernandez said that she is relieved for every day that does not bring bad news about her missing daughter Abigail

One
FBI investigator suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to 
the young women in Cleveland, Ohio who escaped after being held for ten 
years by Ariel Castro.

The content of the letter or where it was postmarked was not revealed today as police fear copycats could send letters that would hamper the investigation.

Abigail was last seen on Wednesday, October 9, leaving Kennett High School in North Conway.

Police
said she walked her normal route home and sent several texts to a 
friend between 2:30 and 3pm. At first, police said she made it home but 
later this was proved false.

New
Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jane Young reminded the public last 
Friday to keep a lookout in their communities for any new faces that 
might fit Abby's description.

Authorities
also released a picture of necklace that the teenager often wore along 
with a purse she was carrying at the time of her disappearance, in the 
hope of jogging someone's memory.

Police issued a picture last Friday of this necklace similar to one which Abigail is fond of wearing in the hopes that it jogs someone's memory who has seen the missing girl

A picture of this purse was also revealed at the Friday press conference which Abigail had with her when she disappeared in October

Ms Young said: 'This is a child. She was 14 when she disappeared and had her 15th birthday a few days later.'

She added that the missing girl has no source of income, so someone is helping her 'whether that is a friend or what we fear is a foe'.

FBI investigator Kieran Ramsey said that they feared although Abby may have left willingly, she was now being coerced or manipulated.

Since her disappearance, Miss Hernandez's parents have made repeated public pleas for her safe return - even stating in a televised interview that they believe she got in a car with someone and that they believe she is in serious trouble.

Her mother Zenya and sister Sarah appeared at the press conference on Friday but did not address the cameras. Ms Young said that Zenya was 'frail' due to the ordeal and requested that the family be given privacy.

The girl’s mother said last month that she believes her daughter will come home someday.

Zenya Hernandez urged her daughter to be strong. Police have said they don’t know whether Abigail was involved in an accident, ran away or was abducted.

'I miss you and love you more than 
you can imagine,' Zenya Hernandez said in her note written on a yellow 
legal pad and dated November 22.  'I feel your absence every day. You 
belong home with me.'

In
her letter, the missing girl’s mother said she believed Abby was alive,
and she expressed hoped that her daughter would find a way to reach out
to her.

‘Abby, you are a 
strong young woman and I am staying strong for you,’ Zenya Hernandez 
wrote. ‘You are courageous, you are smart, and you are beautiful.’

Although investigators think that Abby may have left willingly, she may now be being coerced or manipulated

New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said investigators are still working the case and that it is important to keep Abby's picture in the media -- especially outside of the local area.

‘Abby, I keep having a dream where you come home and I give you the biggest hug ever,’ she wrote in her letter. ‘I know in my heart this dream means something and that it matters. I pray to God it will come true.’

The letter was signed, ' Love, Mom,' with a little heart drawn on the page.

During a press conference held last month in front of the Conway Police Department, Miss Hernandez addressed her daughter, saying she believed Abby was out there somewhere watching her right now.

In an interview with CBS Boston, Miss Hernandez said Abby usually took the bus home, but for some reason decided to walk October 9.

State and Conway police and the FBI have been inundated with hundreds of tips. The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case, Boston.com reported.

The last call made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was October 9 about four hours after she was last seen, investigators said.

Police, FBI, New Hampshire Fish and Game personnel and volunteers have all helped to search for the teenager but have not found any leads

The last sighting of the girl, who ran on the track team for her school and was described as quiet and bright, was around 2.30pm.

Investigators believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back from her nursing job, her daughter was gone.

The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on October 12.

Police said they have not located the girl’s phone, but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm - about four hours after her last sighting.

It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain - a popular local ski resort.

Since then local police and the FBI have searched on foot, in boats, and by helicopter but have failed to turn up any new evidence about the disappearance.

Abigail is 5ft 4in tall and weighs 118lb with brown hair and eyes. She was last seen wearing black stretch pants, tall brown boots and a grey sweater.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Conway police on 603-356-5715.
