Women who live near green open spaces tend to give birth to heavier babies, scientists say.

Researchers looked at 40,000 single births in Tel Aviv, Israel, to work out what impact living within 300 metres of a major green space during pregnancy has on birth outcomes.

'Major' was defined as being 5,000 meters squared, while green spaces included parks, community gardens or even cemeteries that were partly or completely covered with grass, trees, 
shrubs, or other vegetation.

Women who live near large green spaces have bigger babies, research suggests. This may be because those from poorer areas have less access to large areas of outside space

'We found that that overall, an increase of surrounding greenery near the home was associated with a significant increase of birth weight - and decreased risk for low birth weight,' said Professor Michael Friger, of Ben Gurion University Department of Public Health.

'This was the first study outside of the United States and Europe demonstrating associations between greenery and birth weight, as well as the first to report the association with low birth weight.'

One reason may be because the lowest birth weight occurred in the most economically deprived areas with lack of access to green spaces.

The study was published in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine.

It comes after U.S. researchers found that trees in urban areas save over 850 lives a year by scrubbing the air clean.

Although they ability to remove pollution from the atmosphere equates to an average air quality improvement of less than 1 per cent, researchers estimate this prevents 670,000 cases of serious chest, heart or circulation problems in U.S. cities alone.

'In terms of impacts on human health, trees in urban areas are substantially more important than rural trees due to their proximity to people.

'We found that in general, the greater 
the tree cover, the greater the pollution removal, and the greater the 
removal and population density, the greater the value of human health 
benefits.'

Other new research has found that trees in urban areas save over 850 lives a year by scrubbing the air clean

Michael Rains, Director of the Forest Service's Northern Research 
Station said: 'With more than 80 per 
cent of Americans living in urban area, this research underscores how 
truly essential urban forests are to people across the nation.'

The study looked at four pollutants which have established air quality standards, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter.

The effects of air pollution on pulmonary, cardiac, vascular, and neurological systems were also taken into account.

The research, which was the first national study using air pollution modelling to reveal the life saving qualities of trees, was published in the journal 
Environmental Pollution.
