Daniel Lee Thomas has been fined £400 for taking his first ever selfie from the public gallery of a crown court - and then posting it on Facebook

A man has been fined £400 for taking his first ever selfie from the public gallery of a crown court and then posting it on Facebook.

Daniel Lee Thomas, 28, from Connah’s Quay, North Wales, was prosecuted for taking a publishing and photograph of a judge and other parties at Mold Crown Court.

At Flintshire magistrates’ court in Mold, the apprentice joiner pleaded guilty and was fined £400 with £105 costs.

It was ruled, though, that his iPhone - which was seized by police - should be returned to him.

The court heard that Thomas, described as a colourful character with previous convictions, decided to take the photo because it was the first time he had been in a crown court - when he was not the defendant himself.

Magistrates told him it had been ‘a silly misdemeanour’, pointing out there were plenty of signs in the building telling people not to take photographs and it was a well known rule that they should not be taken inside court.

They warned him that he could have been fined up to £2,000.

The photograph of Judge Peter Heywood, a Swansea-based judge sitting at Mold Crown Court on January 31, was reported to police by court officials following a complaint by someone else in court.

Prosecutor Helen Tench said: ‘He attended court as an interested party and took a photograph on his mobile phone. It was subsequently published on the Facebook social media site.

‘It came to light because another interested party made a complaint to the court about it. It was investigated by members of staff.’

Police went to his home, seized the phone and found the offending photograph.

Thomas said that he had not seen the signs.

‘He said that he was not aware that it was an offence.

‘Effectively, he did it because it was his first time in court when he was not the defendant himself.’

Gary Harvey, defending, said that his client was a colourful character who had been to court many times.

He had not noticed the ‘no photographs’ signs and did not think it was an offence. ‘He took the opportunity to take a selfie complete with the crest of the court and the judge in the background.

‘He put it on Facebook and had no idea how much trouble it would cause him.'

Thomas was shocked to have been arrested. ‘He is contrite. He regrets it but will have to pay the penalty,’ said Mr Harvey.

Fortunately, he had not been charged with contempt which could have led to imprisonment.

Mr Harvey said that there would be no repetition - and said that it would be harsh and disproportionate to deprive him of his expensive iPhone.

Outside court, Thomas said: ‘It was my first ever selfie.

‘I had never been in the public gallery before - it was the first time in court when I was not the defendant.’

He said that he did not know which case was on when he took the photograph.

Thomas explained that he had been waiting for three friends to be sentenced after they clambered up on a roof on Deeside and refused to come down.

But the judge had refused to sentence them that day before they were appearing via a live television link from prison.

‘I didn’t know it was an offence,’ he said.
