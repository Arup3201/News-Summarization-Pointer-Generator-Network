Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri treated girlfriend Anara Atanas on Thursday night after having dinner with Sale Sharks star Danny Cipriani on Thursday night.

The trio were seen leaving Victors restaurant in Cheshire after dining there together.

Nasri has been enjoying a midweek break, but should be back in action as Manchester City travel to face Everton on Saturday afternoon.

It's been a somewhat indifferent season so far for 27-year-old Nasri, as he has so far failed to score in 14 Premier League appearances. 

His only goal of the season so far was a pivotal one, however, as he netted the only goal against Roma last month that assured Manchester City's progression to the last-16 of the Champions League.

Cipriani, meanwhile, has been resurrecting his career at Sale, as he targets a place in the England squad for the World Cup later this year.
