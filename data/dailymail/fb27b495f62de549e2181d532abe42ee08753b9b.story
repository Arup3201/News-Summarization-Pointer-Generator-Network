Tradition: Lawrence Williams, 19, has moved 10,000 miles from Australia to Britain to become the fifth generation of his family to join the Royal Navy

A teenager has moved 10,000 miles to become the fifth generation of his family to join the Royal Navy - continuing a loyal service spanning a century.

Lawrence Williams, 19, has moved from Australia to Britain to follow in the seafaring footsteps of his father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather.

The five family members have served their country for a combined 68 years since Ebenezer Hancock signed up at the outset of the Great War in 1914.

He retired in 1936 but inspired his son - Lawrence's great-grandfather, Edward Hancock - to embark on his own naval career three years later.

Edward retired from the Navy in 1958 and his son, George Williams, continued the family tradition by enlisting in 1963 and serving for 23 years.

George's son Gareth Williams - Lawrence's father - joined in 1993 and was a member of the Royal Naval Reserve with the Plymouth based HMS Vivid for four years.

Gareth and his wife Helen emigrated to Australia last year, with their two sons and two daughters.

However, son Lawrence decided to return home to join the Navy - and enlisted 50 years to the day that his grandfather signed up on October 15 1963.

He finished his ten week basic naval training at the end of December at HMS Raleigh in Torpoint, Cornwall, and has begun active service as a trainee engineering technician.

Lawrence said he joined the Royal Navy after being inspired by tales of his family's incredible adventures at sea - and his ultimate ambition is to become a Royal Marine.

'I've always wanted to be part of the Armed Forces and the Royal Navy was the most appealing because of the chance of a trade and the military engagement all over the world,' he said.

'I've enjoyed the whole experience of training. It was challenging, but completing each step individually or as a team gave me a great sense of achievement.'

Lawrence was joined at his passing-out parade in Torpoint by grandfather George, grandmother Barbara and father Gareth - who flew from Down Under to surprise him.

Gareth revealed that Lawrence's younger brother Oscar, 10, is already keen to join the Royal Navy or its Australian equivalent when he's old enough.

He said: 'I am so very proud that Lawrence had not only chosen to follow the family tradition of a seafaring career but also that he has chosen a branch that will give him skills for life.

'I was also very pleased to have been able to make the journey to see Lawrence pass out on the very parade ground that I and my father have both done in the past - a great family tradition is being maintained.'

Proud: Lawrence's grandparents George and Barbara Williams said they were really pleased when he told them he would be joining the Royal Navy

Gift: George and Barbara researched the family's Naval history while Lawrence was in training and were able to present him with a book of photographs containing each relatives' service record

While Lawrence waited to join the Royal Navy, he lived with grandparents George and Barbara in Thornbury, Devon.

George said: 'We were really pleased when Lawrence said he was joining the Royal Navy as an engineer.

'He waited so long to get in and then when we found out he would be joining on 15 October, exactly 50 years after me, it was really weird.

'It's also Barbara's birthday so I suppose it was just meant to be.'

George and Barbara researched the family's Naval history while Lawrence was in training and were able to present him with a book of photographs at his passing-out-parade containing each relatives' service record.

Barbara said: 'We're absolutely thrilled that Lawrence has joined the Royal Navy and really enjoyed getting the album together for him.'
