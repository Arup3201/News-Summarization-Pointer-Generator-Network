 An outraged waitress broke a man’s nose in a gay club after she heard him jokingly call his friend ‘queer’.

Katie Kenyon, 22, had been on a night out at The Factory in Stoke-On-Trent, Staffordshire, when she overheard the comment.

She had been in the smoking area of the club with her gay friend Joshua Halm, 21, when they heard the man greet another by saying ‘Aye up, me queer’.

Katie Kenyon, 22, became outraged after hearing a man use the word 'queer' in a nightclub and assaulted him

They then became involved in a heated argument on the club’s roof terrace when Kenyon hit in the man so hard she broke his nose.

She escaped a prison sentence after admitting the assault on July 13 when she appeared at North Staffordshire Justice Centre yesterday.

Magistrates described it as a ‘serious and unpleasant incident’ and she was told to pay £1,500 in compensation to the injured man.

Abigail Hall, prosecuting, told the court: ‘After she heard the comment the defendant said, “Who do you think you are?”

‘The man stated it was a joke and he didn’t mean any offence.

‘The defendant then pulled her hand back and hit him in the nose, knocking him backwards.

‘His nose began bleeding heavily. He was in shock.

‘He was given tissues and was seen by paramedics, who managed to straighten his broken nose.’

Ms Hall said that using the term ‘queer’ was a ‘well-known and accepted welcome to people who frequent that club’.

She noted that the person the man had greeted that night did not take any offence to the word himself.

Kenyon, from Crewe, Cheshire was arrested and interviewed by police, who she told she had been drinking before the incident.

Nick Ryles, defending, said of Kenyon, who is straight: ‘She accepts she lashed out and caught him in the face.

‘It was a backhanded slap and then she walked away.

‘There was a degree of provocation by this gentleman’s attitude and language.’

Kenyon was on a nightout with a friend at the Factory nightclub in Stoke-on-Trent when the incident happened

Speaking after the case Kenyon, who admitted she was not remorseful, said: ‘I will be appealing the decision. I think the punishment was a bit extreme considering how much he provoked me.

‘His comments were homophobic. He was not a gay man and my gay friend took offence as would many people in a gay bar.

‘I should have walked away and I know what I did was wrong but I was just sticking up for one of my friends because I thought his behaviour was disgusting.’

Magistrates gave her a 12 month community sentence and ordered her to undertake 140 hours of unpaid work.

She must additionally pay £85 in costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

She appeared at North Staffordshire Magistrates Court yesterday where she admitted assault and was ordered to pay £1,500 in compensation to the man
