A grandmother with an aggressive brain tumor has died after waiting more than two months for insurance coverage because of mixups with Nevada's health care exchange.

The family of Linda Rolain, 64, who passed away on Monday, had joined two lawsuits against the State of Nevada and the company that built its troubled online software, Xerox, since April.

'I came in, held her hand,' her devastated husband of 45 years, Robert, told KTNV. 'I whispered in her ear "I love you, I'm gonna be fine". She knew she was gonna die. She really knew it.'

The state launched the Silver State Exchange in October in response to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act - but it was fraught with problems and Xerox was finally dropped in May.

Loss: Linda Rolain, 64, passed away from her brain tumor on Monday. She had encountered numerous issues with getting health insurance coverage following the Affordable Care Act

After suffering a seizure at the end of 2012, Rolain learned in early 2013 that she had a brain tumor and because she couldn’t afford health insurance in the private market, she was the prime candidate for the Affordable Care Act, the Las Vegas Sun noted.

She tried enrolling in the Silver State Exchange in November - well ahead of the December 15 deadline - but repeatedly struggled with sign-up problems and spent hours on the phone to representatives.

They finally enrolled in January and sent a $138 money order to the exchange for a plan that was set to start March 1 - but when she sought treatment, she was told there was no record of her name.

The insurance company finally sent her an insurance card in May and she underwent brain surgery but suffered through a difficult recovery.

She spent her final three weeks in a hospital bed in her living room and in her final four days, she slipped into a coma.

Robert Rolain, who lost 60 pounds due to stress, said working with the Silver State Exchange was 'pure hell'.

He said he 
believes that if enrollment had worked properly, Linda could have 
undergone chemotherapy and radiation to get rid of the tumor - and that 
she would still be alive.

'It's hard, knowing she could have lived a little longer anyway,' he said.

Rolain was one of about 150 Nevadans 
suing Xerox for enrollment issues that 
left them without the health insurance they paid for, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Her lawyer said he fears that hers will not be the last case to end so tragically.

'Some of 
our clients are so ill that if their needs are not addressed now, it is a
 matter of life and death,' Matthew Callister told the Review-Journal.

'We urge all Nevadans to verify that their
 insurance is active and in place in light of the many problems that 
hundreds if not thousands of Nevadans have gone through.'

Much-needed care: After first trying to apply for health insurance coverage in November last year, Mrs Rolain finally underwent surgery in mid-May for her brain tumor but she struggled to recover

Problems: Her family joined two lawsuits against the State of Nevada and the company that built its troubled online software (pictured), Xerox, since April. Xerox has now been dropped

Silver State Exchange officials could not be reached for comment.

A Xerox spokesman told the Review-Journal in a statement that the company would not 'be able to comment on this tragic development'.

Nevada received $91 million in federal money to run the exchange and paid Xerox $12.3 million to build its website, Nevada Health Link, the Las Vegas Sun reported.

By June 1, 36,000 people had signed up, which was 30 per cent of their goal.
