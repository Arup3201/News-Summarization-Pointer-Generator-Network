A girl who was left disfigured after a raccoon savagely mauled her in her crib will finally be given a right ear today - almost 12 years after the attack.

Charlotte Ponce was three months old when the animal chewed off most of her face in 2002, making headlines around the world.

She was adopted by her great aunt and spent years in and out of hospital, including for a procedure two years ago which gave her a new nose.

Brave: Charlotte Ponce was just three months old when a raccoon chewed off her nose, ear and lips

Adopted: Charlotte's parents lost custody of her and she was taken in by her great-uncle Tim, pictured

Tragic: Now 11, Charlotte has been in and out of hospital but it is hoped today's procedure will be the last

Now 11, she will go back under the knife for up to eight hours in what could be her last operation.

But it will be the most complex yet, as it is claimed it has only been performed twice before.

Dr. Kongkrit Chaiyasate will take cartilage from Charlotte's ribs and carve it into the shape of 
an ear using a computer-generated template.

He admitted the procedure is not easy and he will only have one chance to get it right, so he has been practicing on a potato.

Dr Chaiyasate, of Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, told WBIV:
 'As plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit - 
what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her.

'I've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template. It's not easy.'

Mauled: Charlotte Ponce as a baby before and after the attack. Her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl

Surgery: The same doctor who gave Charlotte a new nose, pictured, will mould a right ear out of cartilage from her ribcage and 'grow' it in her forearm for around two months before transplanting it onto her face

Ready to go: Charlotte packs her bags yesterday at her home in Spring Lake as she prepares to leave for hospital

He will implant the basic structure of the ear under the skin of Charlotte's forearm, where it will take several weeks to mould into a fully-formed ear before it can be transplanted again.

Dr Chaiyasate, who will perform the initial procedure today and finish the work in June, was the same doctor who built Charlotte a new nose and repaired her lip and cheek.

He said he could not guarantee success, but would try his best.

Charlotte's adopted mother Sharon Ponce said people from as far as Britain and Australia had contacted the family to tell them what an inspiration the girl has been.

Heart-wrending photos show Charlotte, her skin remarkably well-repaired since her last run of surgery, packing her suitcase yesterday to return for her last big trip to the hospital.

She was just a newborn when her 18-year-old mother and 23-year-old father left her home alone with the pet.

Change: Charlotte's adopted family have more gentle pets. Here she plays with one of her guinea pigs

Good spirits: Remarkably Charlotte retained the hearing in her right ear despite the catastrophic damage

Playing: The whole procedure, which has almost never been done before, will take around two months

The raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in, and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked.

Her great-aunt Sharon and great-uncle Tim only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night's news bulletin.

They gained custody of Charlotte and her brother Marshall, who was then 15 months old, and they and their friends raised more than $10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital.

Sharon had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after Charlotte after doctors said she would need full time care.

Although ears have been made out of ribs before, the method of 'growing' the ear inside the forearm is extremely rare.

Remarkable: Charlotte with her adopted mother Sharon and Dr Kongkrit Chaiyasate after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation. He said today's surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done

Attack: It has been a slow recovery for Charlotte, who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose

Intact: Charlotte as a baby with her brother Marshall before she was attacked in late 2002

Happy family: Charlotte now lives with (from left) her great-uncle Tim, great-aunt Sharon and brother Marshall

It has to be done because Charlotte's ear was so badly damaged that the foundations of an ear structure no longer exist inside her head.

Charlotte previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable.

Yet despite the enormous damage, there is one miracle. Even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life, Charlotte's hearing has been largely unaffected.
