Helen Nicholas has lost her court battle to stay in the military home she has remained living in since her airman husband left

The ex-wife of an RAF squadron leader today lost her human rights court battle to stay in a Ministry of Defence house.

Helen Nicholas, 46, had appealed against a High Court ruling that she had to leave the property in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire. 

If she had won, it would have set a landmark precedent with serious implications for service families and the Armed Forces.

But three senior judges unanimously dismissed her case, meaning she must now vacate the three-bedroom house.

Lord Justice Lewison, sitting with Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Pitchford, told in their judgement how Mrs Nicholas and her squadron leader husband Andrew had moved into the property together in May 2005. 

But when he left in 2007, she  stayed on.

The MoD served notice on her and in 2010 won a court order that she had to leave the property.

But she still refused to move out claiming the eviction was against her right to family life under the European Convention on Human Rights.

Her legal team argued that the move was discriminatory and she would be left on the streets as she would not qualify for local authority help if evicted.

But High Court judge Mr Justice Burton rejected her arguments in 2013 and said she had to go.

In dismissing her appeal today, Lord Justice Lewison said the squadron leader had no more than a service tenancy, meaning that, once he had left, the MoD was entitled to take back possession.

The court heard that the MoD argued that a threat to the security of tenure for service personnel would interfere with military effectiveness, especially if it prevented rapid redeployment of personnel.

They claimed it would inhibit them in providing housing for service personnel and require it to rent accommodation locally from the private sector, which would be an unnecessary burden on the public purse.

The judges agreed that the MoD had validly terminated her licence to remain in the property, and there was no breach of her human rights.

The disputed property - where Mrs Nicholas has lived for nearly 10 years - is in this street in Bushey Heath, near Watford, Hertfordshire
