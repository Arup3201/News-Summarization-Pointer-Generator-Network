Eric Abidal has joined Greek champions Olympiacos just days after signing a new deal with Monaco.

The 34-year-old had signed a new one-year deal with the Ligue 1 club along with fellow defender Ricardo Carvalho on Thursday.

However, having made 29 appearances for Monaco last season, Abidal has now departed for Greece.

Olympiacos announced the capture of the France international via Twitter and a statement on the club's website read: 'Olympiacos announces the acquisition by transcription from Monaco, of the player Eric Abidal.'

The left back, who was diagnosed with a cancerous liver tumour in 2011 and had a liver transplant the following year, has also played for Lyon and Barcelona.

Former France star Christian Karembeu holds an advisory role with Olympiakos and was reported to have been be a key figure behind the signing.

The news comes after Monaco revealed they would not be signing Abidal's former Barcelona team-mate Victor Valdes.

The goalkeeper, who is currently a free agent and has been sidelined with a knee injury since March, reportedly had a medical with the French side on Wednesday.

However, Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said on Thursday: 'Valdes will not come to Monaco. He is injured, so he will not come.'

Some reports suggest Abidal's sudden departure may be linked with Monaco's decision not to sign the stopper.
