Fashion stores like Marks & Spencer and Next have been unable to shift winter coats and boots because of an Indian summer that has stretched into October.

M&S is expected to report worse than expected clothing and footwear sales next month after it was caught out by one of the warmest autumns in a century.

The pattern follows similar warnings issued by Next and the N Brown Group, which is an online retailer, while both John Lewis and H&M said the warmer weather has had an impact on sales.

Honor Westnedge, lead analyst at Verdict, a retail consultancy, said fashion giants have lost out because they failed to have sufficient stocks of T-shirts and warm weather dresses to match the hotter than expected temperatures.

Marks & Spencer and Next have been unable to shift winter coats and boots because of an Indian summer that has stretched into October

She said they need to watch the weather more carefully to tailor what they put on their shelves, rather than stick rigidly to seasonal traditions.

The problem this year is that many retailers began putting winter coats and knitwear in their windows and on their shelves in September at a time when much of the country was bathed in sunshine.

Miss Westnedge said: ‘We've known an Indian summer was coming since June, yet the high-street retailers did not react quickly enough.

‘The retailers need to think about pre-empting this weather with transitional stock to carry them through until the consumer wants that heavier garment.’

September was among the warmest Britain has seen over the last 100 years and the temperature gauge in central England hit an average of 15.3C, which was higher than August.

It was the warmest September since 2006 and also the driest since records began in 1910, which hit sales of wet weather gear, such as macs, trench coats and boots.

The warm weather continued into early October, forcing retailers, including M&S, to make significant price cuts on autumn and winter ranges.

Current deals at M&S include a 58per cent price cut on the Per Una Pure Cotton Bodysensor Coated Herringbone Mac with Stormwear, which is down to £35.99, and a Buttonsafe Pure Cotton Trench Mac with Stormwear, which is half price at £42.99.

Among the savings on woollens, is the Per Una Speziale Wool Rich Kimono Jumper with Cashmere, which is down almost 60per cent to £52.99.

Retail analyst, Richard Hyman, said: ‘Trying to sell coats and warmer autumn and winter clothing to people who are in T-shirts and enjoying the sunshine has clearly been extremely challenging.’

Analysts at stockbrokers Citi say they expect general merchandise sales at M&S in the three months to September 29 to be down by four per cent on the same period last year, which is worse than the one per cent previously expected. As a result, it has cut its forecast for the company’s full-year profit by 1.5per cent to £650m.

Next recently warned that if the warm weather continued into October – as it has – this would inevitably have an impact on its profits. This would take them below the previously expected prediction of £775m-£815m.

Retailers are praying for a return to real autumn weather, however it seems that after some wind and rain across England and Wales in the next few days, temperatures will climb again by the weekend.

A warm air flow from Southern Spain is expected to provide three days of balmy weather for much of Britain late next week.

An autumnal mini-heatwave is set to kick off next Friday and temperatures could climb to around 21C in much of Southern England, the Midlands, East Anglia and South and East Wales.

Highs in the South East may hit 22C (71.6F) next weekend, which is way above the 16C average maximum for London in October.

The mild weather will also extend to the North East where the mercury could touch 20C (68F) compared to a monthly average high of just 13C in Newcastle.
