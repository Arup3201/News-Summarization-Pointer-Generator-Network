When the Conservatives unveiled their first poster of the election campaign, critics branded it bland and 'a bit French'.

But it turns out they were wrong. The image used to claim Britain is on the 'road to a stronger economy' is actually German.

Tory spin doctors at least had the sense to remove the cracks and potholes in the original image, but George Osborne's claim that it was 'a British picture, a British road' has left the Chancellor with some explaining to do.

Green and pleasant land: The flag says this Tory election poster depicts Britain the image is not quite what it seems

Today it was claimed that the road is not even in Britain, but is based on this image taken by German photographer Alexander Burzik in Weimar

All the main parties have sought to use the start of the year to launch the first shots of what will be a long election campaign.

Senior Tories, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg will all use public appearances today to set out their stall to voters.

But posters released by Labour and the Tories have faced criticism for their accuracy, or lack of it.

The Conservative poster was launched on Friday, depicting an empty road carving through green fields has already caused controversy for being bland, ambiguous, and a touch French.

But the words on the image caused problems for Mr Cameron, with the claim: 'The deficit halved'.

The claim infuriated some experts, who pointed out that the deficit – the annual gap between the Government's spending and income – has been reduced from a peak of £153billion at the time of the election to £91billion this year, a fall of just over 40 per cent.

Mr Cameron stressed at the poster's launch on Friday that the claim was to have halved the deficit in relation to GDP.

Tory sources said the party had always been 'clear that when we talk about the deficit being halved that's what we are referring to'. 

Now it has emerged that that the road is not even in Britain, but is based on an image taken by German photographer Alexander Burzik in Weimar.

At the weekend Mr Osborne insisted: 'It's a British picture, a British road.'

But while the horizon between the two images differs, the verges bare an uncanny similarity.

Some efforts have been made to cover up the deception. The entire image has been flipper, cracks and discoloration removed from the road surface and the white lines erased. 

The white clouds in the blue sky have also been rearranged.

Labour shadow cabinet minister Lord Wood said on Twitter: 'There's something perfect about the Tories' 'road to a stronger economy' actually being a photo of the road to Weimar.' 

This is a reference to the disastrous economic situation in 1930s Weimar Germany.

Meanwhile, Labour has released a campaign image based on a poster of Mr Cameron used by the Tories in 2010.

The Labour poster, to be used online, says: 'The Tories want to cut spending on public services back to the levels of the 1930s, when there was no NHS.

'The NHS as you know it cannot survive five more years of David Cameron.'

It is based on warnings from the Office for Budget Responsibility last month that forecast total government spending will fall to just 35.2 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 – the lowest level for 80 years. 

According to the OBR, government spending falling to just 35.2 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 marks a dramatic decline from 45.3 per cent in 2009-10, the last year of the Labour government.

In the mid-1970s state spending accounted for almost half of the entire economy.

However, total government spending will still be spending £765billion-a-year, compared to under £100billion in real terms in the late 1940s.

A Conservative source said: 'The New Year has only started and Labour are already resorting to wild scaremongering. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility was crystal clear - under our plan to deal with the deficit, day-to-day public spending will return to the levels of 2002-03. In contrast, Ed Miliband has no plan and would plunge the economy back into chaos.' 

Mr Cameron today insisted that further spending cuts were needed to get the nation's debts under control.

Labour has launched this web image today, attacking the Tories over spending cuts, but the reference to the 1930s is in connection with spending as a proportion of the whole economy, not cash sum

David Cameron today insisted that further spending cuts were needed to get the nation's debts under control

He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'Look what happened in countries like Portugal and Greece who saw their debts and deficits get out of control. They had to cut their NHS by 16 per cent, 17 per cent. 

'What I fear with Labour is you have a bunch of politicians who have learnt nothing from the last five years. 

'My concern is this, if you want to get families out of poverty you've got to get your debt and your deficit under control. That is line one of the long-term economic plan for the country which is working.

'I am a compassionate conservative: compassion isn't just measured in the money that you spend, compassion is measured in creating a growing economy so you can have the stronger NHS, stronger social services.'

But Labour's shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie said: 'David Cameron says he is happy to be judged on his record over five years. This is a record of an NHS going backwards, working people £1600 a year worse off and £200 billion more borrowing than planned.

'He should also be judged on his risky and extreme plans for the future, which the OBR says will take public spending as a share of national income back to the 1930s. This will have a hugely damaging impact on our defence, policing and local services.

'And on top of this David Cameron has made over £7 billion of unfunded tax promises. These could only be paid for by another Tory VAT rise, even deeper cuts to public spending - or both.'
