The shop owner has admitted lacing his noodles with opium in a bid to 'improve business' 

A Chinese noodle shop owner has admitting lacing his dishes with opium in a bid to keep customers coming back.

The added ingredient was only discovered when a customer who had just eaten at the restaurant in Shaanxi province was pulled over by traffic police.

Liu Juyou was made to carry out a routine drugs test when he tested positive.

He denied touching the illegal substance and suspected it might have been his earlier meal, according to the Xi’an Evening News.

The 26-year-old was detained for 15 days on charges of drug abuse but was only released after he persuaded family members to try the noodles and then take a drugs test – and all of whom tested positive.

The shop owner, named only as Zhang, has admitted that he bought 2kg (4.4lb) of poppy buds containing the plant’s seeds for 600 yuan (£60) in August.

He crushed them into a powder and added the substance along with seasoning to his noodles to ‘make the food taste better’ and to ‘improve business’, reports the Hua Shang Bao.

According to police, the unprocessed seeds contain enough opiates to progressively build up in the body, triggering a positive drugs test result.

The paper also said that adding poppy seeds to hot pot sauce was not uncommon in China but its use has since been banned.

Similar cases of lacing noodles with opium had been reported in 2010 and 2012.

Zhang has reportedly been detained for 10 days.
