A huge landslide that saw tens of thousands of tonnes of chalk give way without warning  from 120ft cliffs yesterday took place along Heritage coastline.

The massive section of the cliffs near the beauty spot of Durdle Door in Dorset collapsed and wiped out part of the 630-mile South West Coast Path.

A giant pile of rocks now nearly reaches 
the height of the cliffs after the slump, turning the turquoise water a 
powdery white colour.

The coast path is popular with walkers, 
but officials have closed off the area and are urging people to stay 
away for fear of more rock falls.

The
crew of an Army safety boat monitoring their nearby firing ranges 
alerted the coastguard to the landslide yesterday at 8am.

A spokesman for Portland Coastguard 
said: ‘It is quite extraordinary. A massive fall has taken out part of 
the cliff, it is huge.

'The
cliff has broken away right from the top and has left a pile of chalk 
that is as high as the cliffs. There have been several landslides along 
the coastline recently but this is by far and away the biggest.

‘The
message is for people to stay away from the area and not to ignore the 
signs that are going up advising them not to go any further.’

Meanwhile two ramblers were photographed deciding to walk dangerously close 
to the edge hours after the slippage yesterday.

A Maritime & Coastguard Agency
spokesman said: ‘What do you think they are doing on the edge of a 
collapsed cliff? There's a reason we give advice.’

'Anyone who is tempted to go and have a look must stay away. The edge there is still unstable. The path is being diverted and signposted'

Maritime & Coastguard Agency

The
agency said it was believed that the landslide happened on Monday night
- and it did not know if anyone had been injured in the incident.

It
added: ‘Anyone who is tempted to go and have a look must stay away. The
edge there is still unstable. The path is being diverted and 
signposted.

'Please do not go past the sign that says: “Do not go past 
the sign”. By doing so, you are putting yourself at risk and anyone 
trying to rescue you.’

But
a woman claiming to be in the photograph with her son got in touch with
MailOnline last night to say she was unhappy with the agency’s 
comments.

She said: ‘I take
exception to the coastguard saying: “What do you think they were doing 
on the edge of a collapsed cliff?” It is misleading and unfair. We, and 
the other walkers who were there at 10am when the coastguard took the 
photos, were not aware of the landslip.

'The coast is eroding and there is not a lot that can be done about it. It is something we have to live with'

Richard Edmonds, Jurassic Coast chief geologist

‘There
were no warning notices - the area was not roped off at the time. Other
people in fact were walking much closer to the collapsed cliff.

'My son 
and I took a different path because we were not comfortable walking too 
close to the edge of the cliff, which we all thought was part of the 
path. It's unfair for the coastguard to imply that we were stupid to walk near a collapsed cliff despite their warning.’

Yesterday's landslip is the latest in a series that have changed the face of the protected Jurassic Coast.

Earlier
this month a pile of chalk boulders, some the size of cars, left the 
beach to the west of Durdle Door blocked off following a fall.

In March, a section of the coast near Weymouth, Dorset, was effectively split in two after a 150ft long crevasse appeared on the clifftop. 

Repeated landslides further along the 
coast near Lyme Regis have also led to the demolition of £1million of 
beach chalets that were made unsafe.

'It is quite extraordinary. A massive fall has taken out part of the cliff, it is huge. The cliff has broken away right from the top and has left a pile of chalk that is as high as the cliffs'

Portland Coastguard spokesman

And last summer, holidaymaker Charlotte Blackman, 22, was tragically killed at Burton Bradstock when 400 tonnes of falling rocks fell on her.

Richard Edmonds, chief geologist for the Jurassic Coast, said: ‘Today's (Tuesday's) landslip is an exceptionally big rock fall.

‘The land along parts of the Jurassic Coast is made up of soft clay rock and when it gets saturated by heavy rain over long periods followed by dry weather like we have had, landslips take place. We have also had some big seas recently lapping at the base of the cliffs.

'So that may have been a factor in what has happened. These landslips are taking parts of the coastal path away. The coast is eroding and there is not a lot that can be done about it. It is something we have to live with. That is the reason why the coast is so dramatic and beautiful.’
