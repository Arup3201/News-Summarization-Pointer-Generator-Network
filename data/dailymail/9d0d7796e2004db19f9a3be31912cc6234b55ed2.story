Accused: Christopher Sefton allegedly starved and beat his six-year-old son for months

A six-year-old boy was starved, beaten and only fed gruesome hot dog, carrot and oil 'shakes' by his abusive parents, prosecutors have claimed.

The boy's father, Christopher Sefton, and his wife Lori Lloyd allegedly abused the boy for months at their Auburn, Washington home - even keeping the child out of school to hide his bruises.

The couple, who allegedly began abusing the boy in October as punishment for imagined misbehavior, now face felony charges, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported.

They were arrested after a child 
protective services worker at the boy's school reported that he showed 
signs of abuse, including quick weight loss and bruising to his face.

The
 boy, who has not been named, told detectives that he was bruised after 
Sefton punched him for putting food on a car seat as he tied his shoe, 
according to court papers.

He
 also told child welfare workers that he had no been fed for several 
nights, while school staff also reported that he had been stealing food 
from other children or digging through the trash for food.

The child 'constantly states that he is hungry', a detective wrote in charging papers.

Medical care: Staff at Seattle Children's Hospital noted signs of alleged abuse on the boy's body, including multiple bruises and possible burns. The child said he often went without food

The boy also claimed he was only fed a
 blended 'shake' of 'bread, carrots, water, hot dog and vegetable oil' 
for breakfast and dinner.

He said he didnâ€™t like the shakes, but drank them so he didn't go hungry, according to charging papers.

Sefton
 allegedly told authorities that he had fed the shakes to the boy, but 
insisted that the child would choke on solid foods. But this claim was 
refuted by investigators.

After the couple were arrested on March 20, the boy was taken to Seattle Children's Hospital, and medical staff noted signs of alleged abuse, including multiple bruises and possible burns.

'Over the course of several months, Sefton and Lloyd have shown a pattern (and) practice of withholding the basic necessities of life' from the boy, the detective said.

The couple have both been charged with second-degree criminal mistreatment, while Sefton has also been charged with second-degree assault. Neither has posted bond.
