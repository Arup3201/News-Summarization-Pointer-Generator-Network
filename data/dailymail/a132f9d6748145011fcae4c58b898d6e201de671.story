A pregnant Base jumper has died in what she had pledged would be her final leap before retiring.

Wioletta Roslan, of Sweden, had said she would give up the high-risk sport after falling pregnant, but decided to make one last jump near Stechelberg, Switzerland, which ended in tragedy.

The 37-year-old adrenaline junkie was four months pregnant when she died after her parachute failed to open during a Base (Buildings, Antennas, Spans and Earth) jump last weekend.

Her boyfriend Aleksander Domalewski jumped alongside her and could do nothing but watch as she realised her parachute wouldn’t open and spread her arms awaiting the impact of the 990ft drop.

The Via Ferrata cliff was Miss Roslan’s favourite spot for Base jumping and she had been there many times before with her partner.

She was experienced in extreme sports after taking up skydiving as a 19-year-old in Malmo, Sweden.

Her mother Halina Zaniewska-Pettersson, 68, said: ‘I was always terrified every time I knew that she was doing the sport again and I kept expecting the worst.

'When she said that she was going to do one last jump while pregnant I begged her not to go.

‘But she always wanted to carry on. I couldn't force not to do it – she was old enough to make up her own mind about things.’

Miss Roslan
 had managed to build a successful career as an inspector working on oil
 rigs – and in her spare time travelled the world as a professional Base
 jumper.

'I only feel alive when I jump. I find normal life boring. I know that death always flies with me but we only have a certain amount of time on the earth. When the sun goes down then it's game over whoever you are'

Wioletta Roslan

She said in a recent interview for 
Swiss television that Base jumping made her feel alive and as if  there 
were no limits in life.

Miss Roslan said:
 ‘I only feel alive when I jump. I find normal life boring. I know that 
death always flies with me but we only have a certain amount of time on 
the earth. When the sun goes down then it's game over whoever you are.’

She had lived in the Berner Oberland region for two years doing odd jobs in order to spend every spare moment jumping from local cliffs. 

She told her mother it had been the 
happiest time in her life and she wanted to go for a final jump with her
 boyfriend before retiring.

After three people made successful jumps, Miss Roslan and her boyfriend stepped up to the edge.

Ms Zaniewska-Pettersson said: ‘Aleksander jumped at the same time as her and could only watch what happened. He told me that she desperately tried to get her parachute to open without success.

'It did not open and in the last moment she realised she was not going to succeed. He told me that she had simply spread her arms and waited for the impact.’

Miss Roslan died instantly. Local emergency doctor Bruno Durrer said: ‘Every death in the mountains is tragic but this one was particularly so because I knew her and also because she was pregnant.’

Ms Zaniewska-Pettersson said: ‘I am totally devastated and shocked. I picked so often to give up jumping but she just didn't listen and now it's too late.

'When she was in Switzerland she was only there for Base jumping – every spare moment she was climbing and jumping.

Her death is the fifth in connection with Base jumping in the Berner Oberland region this year.

Ms Zaniewska-Pettersson said: ‘All that is left for me now memories but my daughter lived her life to the full – she was a true adventurer travel to France and Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and America to do with her sport.

'She was full of life and was a wonderful girl. But she couldn't imagine a life without Base jumping.’
