Separated: Woody Allen with Dylan Farrow. Despite the case being thrown out he was not allowed to see her again

Woody Allen has reacted with outrage after his daughter Dylan Farrow penned an open letter describing how she was allegedly sexually assaulted by the director when she was seven-year-old.

The young woman yesterday penned an open letter, published on Nicholas Kristof's blog for The New York Times.

Allen's attorney Elkan Abramowitz hit
 out at the renewed allegations, today pointing the finger at Mia Farrow
 for the latest scandal.

'It
 is tragic that after 20 years a story engineered by a vengeful lover 
(Mia Farrow) resurfaces after it was fully vetted and rejected by 
independent authorities,' he said in a statement to Mother Jones.

'The one to blame for Dylan's distress is neither Dylan nor Woody Allen.'

While
 Allen, who has consistently denied the allegations, has yet to personally respond publicly, his 
publicist Leslee Dart today said the director 'read the article and 
found it untrue and disgraceful'.

'He will be responding very soon...At the time, a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts,' Dart said in a statement to Mother Jones.

'The
 experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation; that 
Dylan Farrow had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and 
reality; and that Dylan Farrow had likely been coached by her mother Mia
 Farrow. No charges were ever filed.'

Dylan Farrow thanked the public for their support after breaking her silence on the sexual abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her adopted father Woody Allen, as the director's lawyer accused Dylan's 'vengeful' mother Mia Farrow of 'engineering' the sensational claims.

'She's really heartened by the response and support she's getting,' Kristof, reportedly a friend Mia Farrow and her son Ronan Farrow, told PEOPLE.

'She sends a big thank you to all those speaking up about sexual abuse and trying to break the silence.'

However Dylan Farrow, now living in Florida and using a different name, has not escaped criticism.

Some commentators have accused the 28-year-old, who also goes by the name Malone Farrow, of cynically timing her accusations to thwart her former adoptive father's chances of winning an Oscar for his critically acclaimed film Blue Jasmine.

Unsettling allegations: Farrow, seen left with Allen in Italy in 1991, and with her mother and sister in 1992 (right), wrote how the director would stick his thumb in her mouth, force her to get in bed with him and place his head in her naked lap

Dylan Farrow's first-person account 
marked first time she directly addressed the alleged sex abuse which was
 said to have occurred in the 1990s.

In
 gut-wrenching detail, Dylan Farrow wrote in her statement how at age 
seven, her adoptive father, Allen, allegedly led her by the hand to a 
dim attic on the second floor of their house.

'He told me to lay on my stomach and 
play with my brother’s electric train set,' Dylan Farrow recounted. 'Then
 he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering 
that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go
 to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.'

She noted that to this day, she finds it hard to look at toy trains.

Farrow
 went on to describe how the award-winning director of 'Annie Hall' and 
'Manhattan' would always find a way to touch her and do things to her 
she did not like, including sticking his thumb in her mouth, forcing her
 to get into bed with him and placing his head in her naked lap.

'I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different,' she said.

Unable to keep her alleged encounters
 with her father secret anymore, young Dylan went to her mother, asking 
her if her own father used to do the same things to her that Allen was 
doing.

The girl's 
explosive allegations put an end to Farrow and Allen's relationship in 
1992, setting off a legal battle in which Dylan claimed the filmmaker 
accused his former girlfriend of brainwashing her daughter into thinking
 that he had assaulted her.

What followed next was a drawn-out process in which Dylan was dragged from one psychologist to the next, recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying.

In the end, Allen was denied visitation rights with his children, but a Connecicut prosecutor declined to charge him, saying that while there was enough evidence for the case to potentially stand up in court, he was dropping criminal proceedings due to Dylan's fragile state.

Allen, 78, has always denied the 
allegations of sexual abuse. He was 
never charged with, or convicted of, a crime in this case. 

Hit back: Woody Allen has again been forced to deny claims he abused Dylan Farrow

Keeping a low profile: Allen was accompanied by a retinue of people, but he sought to avoid drawing attention to himself

Shorlty after Allen and Farrow's split, it was revealed that the filmmaker began 
an affair with his adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom he married in 
1997.

On Saturday 
night, just hours after the release of his daughter's bombshell letter, a
 somber-looking Allen was spotted arriving at a New York Knicks game in 
New York with two of his other adopted daughters in tow. 

In her open letter, 
Dylan Farrow claimed that Allen used his ‘sexual relationship’ with her 
stepsister, Soon-Yi, to cover up the abuse Dylan herself had allegedly 
suffered at his hands. 

‘That
 he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up,’ Miss 
Farrow wrote. ‘I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be 
near other little girls.’

Dylan
 candidly talked about the effect the alleged ordeal had on her 
later life, including a battle with eating disorders and her terror at 
being touched by men. The woman also said she began cutting herself.

Farrow also used her soul-baring 
confession to attack the Hollywood establishment for 'turning a blind 
eye' and helping along Allen’s career in the entertainment industry. 

‘Most
 found it easier to accept the ambiguity, to say, “who can say what 
happened,” to pretend that nothing was wrong,’ she said. ‘Actors praised
 him at awards shows. Networks put him on TV. Critics put him in 
magazines.

Final straw: Dylan explained that what prompted her to write the open letter was seeing her adopted father receiving yet another Oscar nomination for his latest film, Blue Jasmine

‘Each time I saw my abuser’s face – 
on a poster, on a t-shirt, on television – I could only hide my panic 
until I found a place to be alone and fall apart.’

Dylan
 Farrow's decision to offer a first-person account of her torment has 
been spurred by Allen's latest nomination for an Academy Award and last 
month’s Golden Globes ceremony, where he received the prestigious Cecil B
 DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award.

‘It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away,’ Dylan wrote.

Farrow,
 who described herself as a happily married woman, did not shy away from
 condemning the actors who have starred in her father’s films over the 
years, some of whom were on hand January 12 to present Allen with his 
Golden Globe.

‘What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?’ she asked.

Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have been unwavering in their support of her.

On the night of the Golden Globes ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's alleged assault in a scathing tweet.

‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ the newly hired MSNBC host wrote.

Dylan Farrow concluded her letter with an appeal to the movie-going public to think twice before they rush to heap praise on her talented adoptive father.

‘So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter.

‘Are you imagining that? Now, what’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?’
