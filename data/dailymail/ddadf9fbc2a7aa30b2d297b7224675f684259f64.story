Neil Lennon has been appointed as the new manager of Bolton Wanderers.

Lennon had been poised to speak to Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia earlier this week but met Bolton owner Eddie Davies on Saturday before securing a deal with the Championship strugglers.

The 41-year-old told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'I've got a big job on my hands but I'm very excited. There's a good core of players within the squad.’

He will be joined at the Macron Stadium by Johan Mjallby and Garry Parker.

A Bolton statement read: 'The extensive list of high calibre applicants demonstrated how those candidates viewed the opportunity to manage the club, even in its present position at the bottom of the Championship table.

'Following a process of first and second interviews with a shortlist of initial candidates, a unanimous decision was taken by Eddie Davies, Brett Warburton and Phil Gartside.

'The club are delighted and excited to appoint Neil Lennon. He brings with him experience at the highest level and an infectious enthusiasm to take the club forward.

'He will officially take charge of the Bolton Wanderers team from Monday morning in the run up to our upcoming game away at Birmingham City.' 

Former Celtic boss Lennon lifts the Scottish Premiership league trophy in May before later leaving the club

Currently propping up the English second tier after winning just one league game this season, Bolton have been looking for a new manager since parting company with Scot Dougie Freedman earlier this month. 

Lennon has been away from football’s front-line since leaving Celtic in May after a successful four-year spell.

He was due to travel to Saudi Arabia this week for talks on the vacant Al-Ittihad post but visa problems meant he and his backroom staff were unable to travel to Jeddah.

Whilst a remuneration package of over £2million per year was attractive, Lennon had reservations at moving to the Middle East in any event in terms of his career development.

The challenge of firstly securing the Trotters’ place in the Championship before building for promotion is far more appealing and he will take the team for the first time at Birmingham next week.
