A mother has pleaded guilty to sexually exploiting her own children after it was revealed she and her ex-husband had planned to abuse them before they were even born.

Sarah Adleta, 29, was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor. Her Marines veteran husband Jonathan Adleta, who was awarded the Purple Heart, was found guilty on Thursday and faces 10 years to life in jail.

The disgraced Marine officer, 25, allegedly wanted to have 'daddy-daughter sex', according to graphic details from the trial in Orlando, Florida.

Doomed: Sarah Adleta, 29, was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor for allegedly abusing her two children. Her Marines veteran husband Jonathan Adleta, who has been found guilty, had planned the abuse before they were born

Jonathan Adleta allegedly told Sarah when she was pregnant that he would only marry her if she consented to him abusing their daughter while she was expected to do the same to their son, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

The abuse began when the little girl was born in March 2009. The couple married the following year.

The mother told the court this week that she consented to the abuse of her children because she loved Adleta and needed the financial support.

Even after the couple divorced, the children's horrifying ordeal continued. The mother went to live in Orlando, Florida with the children but her ex convinced her to let him abuse their daughter over Skype.

She also brought her daughter to visit her ex-husband in Oklahoma so that he could abuse her.

In 2012, Adleta found a new girlfriend who allowed him to sexually abuse her daughter.

Samantha Bryant, 23, told a court 
this week that Adleta molested her daughter and she took photographs. 
She has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting her daughter.
