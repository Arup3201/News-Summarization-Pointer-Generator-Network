So the man who could easily have been our Deputy Prime Minister today contemplates a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice, though few tears will be shed by fellow politicians even among his own Lib-Dem colleagues.

And for what? Three points on his driving licence for speeding; three measly points which would have been added to those he already had for using his mobile phone while driving, and possibly cost him his licence.

No issue so penetratingly defines the ferocious political ambition of Chris Huhne, nor his stupidity and lack of judgement.

Guilty: Chris Huhne, with his partner Carina Trimingham, speaks to the media, outside Southwark Crown Court

His resignation as an MP brings to a full stop the rise of a brilliant man whose life has been marked as much by lies and obfuscation as by the smooth progress characterised by the ease with which he stepped from Westminster school to a first class PPE degree at Oxford.

This time last year, Huhne was in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, consummate politician, and one who views any small blemish on his record as a hindrance to advancement.

That old summons for speeding on the M11 had been long forgotten. The day when it had dropped through the door of his Hampshire home in June, 2003, Huhne wasn’t even a member of Parliament – that was still two years away.

But the then MEP for South East England was always planning a bigger future, at Westminster. A man marked out by his arrogance, he had no intention of remaining merely one of those Euro MPs most people have never even heard of.

His practice of dealing expediently with inconveniences went back to his Oxford days at Magdalen College. Then, to help smooth his path to the executive of the university Labour Club, he dropped the name by which he had always been known, Christopher Paul-Huhne, and adopting the chirpy Chris Huhne.

That speeding summons had to be similarly dealt with and, as we now know and he will forever bitterly regret, the police accepted the story that his Greek-born, economist wife Vicky Pryce, mother of his three children aged 18 to 25, was driving the speeding car, not him.

Ex-wife: Vicky Pryce, Chris Huhne's former wife, arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London for her trial hearing accused of perverting the course of justice. She denies the offence on the grounds of marital coercion

She took his three points. And that would have been that. For her part Vicky Pryce denies the offence of perverting the course of justice on the grounds of marital coercion.

But as she would discover, this was not the only time she would be used as a prop to promote his driven political ambitions.

Speed forward to the general election of 2005, where Huhne is fighting the Tory-held marginal of Eastleigh, Hampshire, and we find his election literature desperately gushing: ‘Family matters to me so much. Where would we be without them?’

Affair: Chris Huhne, right, arrives at court for his hearing, with Carina Trimingham

Pre-election leaflets shoved through voters’ front doors showed pictures of his wedding with the caption ‘Getting married does not seem like 26 years ago’, and another picture of him feeding a baby, with the caption, ‘I took to becoming a father so seriously I gave up smoking’.

Just how important family matters really were to Chris Huhne became crystal clear in June, 2010 when it emerged that, for perhaps two years, he had been having a secret affair with his former press officer, Carina Trimingham, who was in a civil partnership with a woman.

He had even been using his Hampshire constituency home for trysts with Miss Trimingham, now 45, and 13 years younger than his wife.

Disclosure of the affair in two Sunday newspapers produced an almost comic response from the Cabinet Minister, showing how easily he dismissed moral issues.

In a carbon copy of that other Cabinet rank politician, Labour’s late Robin Cook, another dedicated family politician caught bang-to-rights in an affair with his secretary, Huhne immediately issued a statement saying: ‘I am in a serious relationship with Carina Trimingham and am separating from my wife.’ (Cook was actually at the airport about to go on holiday with his wife when he was forced by Alastair Campbell to decide – wife or mistress.)

Ms Pryce, a thoughtful figure, is best remembered that difficult day for despatching her son Peter to the newsagents to buy all the papers.

But it was a full 11 months later that the allegation which would destroy him first appeared in a Sunday newspaper.

Imagine Huhne’s horror at this exposure, the loss of face over something, in retrospect, so ludicrously trivial.

Fleeting victory: Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce celebrate his 2010 election win, but Huhne is now contemplating a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice

This is a man used to brushing awkward inconveniences aside, a millionaire politician whose expenses included receipts for bus tickets, milk and loo rolls, as well as £119 for a Corby trouser press, but who had the temerity to declare with typical passion on his (now former) constituency website that ‘MPs should spend the taxpayers’ money more carefully.’

Huhne and Trimingham were living together and he had been hoping that his domestic troubles were behind him. He was even quietly eyeing the party leadership again – despite having thrown his hat twice into the ring and lost – as Nick Clegg struggled to maintain party support within the Coalition.

The first time he had lost to Sir ‘Ming’ Campbell in 2006 – impudent, really, for an MP who’d been in the Commons less than a year. A year later, when Campbell stood down, he had another go. This time he lost by a squeak to Clegg.

'Imagine Huhne’s horror at this exposure, the loss of face over something, in retrospect, so ludicrously trivial' 

No-one supported him more, or was more desperate for him to win, than Carina Trimingham. Indeed, it can surely be argued that Carina’s love and support may well have cost him everything. It is arguable that Carina’s earlier admiration for Huhne cost him the leadership as well.

This is what happened. He and Clegg were neck and neck – Clegg with his youthful appeal, and Huhne with that touch of gravitas. The older man was a success, someone who’d lived a bit, who’d worked both as a journalist and in the City and made a lot of money buying properties – currently he has seven.

In a party poll of more than 41,000 votes, Huhne lost by a mere 511. What tipped the balance against him was a live debate on the BBC’s Sunday programme, The Politics Show.

Before the programme, presenter Jon Sopel had received from Huhne’s team a detailed aide memoire detailing a list of Clegg’s policy fault lines. Astonishingly for a fellow party member, it was titled: ‘Calamity Clegg’.

Nothing could have more clearly indicated Huhne’s stop-at-nothing determination to be the party leader, and it is hardly surprising that Clegg made a formal complaint about his opponent’s ‘dirty tricks’ to the party’s chief whip running the leadership election, Lord Rennard.

Huhne denied all knowledge of the document.

‘It’s quite impossible to check everything that goes out of the office…I can assure you it did not have my authorisation,’ he declared. It was an over-zealous young researcher who was responsible for drawing up the document’.

Oh, and the researcher was not actually on the staff. But the episode turned many Lib-Dem party members against him.

In fact, as the Daily Mail discovered, the ‘Calamity Clegg’ document had been created and circulated by Carina Trimingham, who was working as his leadership campaign press manager – although this was before they started their affair.

Whether Miss Trimingham considers herself in any way responsible for her lover’s demise, first in sharing his bed and then pushing his leadership ambitions too hard, hardly matters now.

She suffered defeat in a contest of her own last year in the High Court, when she lost a privacy and harassment claim against Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail.

Mr Justice Tugendhat ruled that as the ‘secret mistress’ of a married MP, she was a public figure and only had herself to blame for newspaper articles about her private life. She is appealing against the judgement.

As Huhne’s arrogance fades from Westminster, it is impossible to over-estimate the mess that he has made of his life, especially with his children. And the future?

No doubt Chris Huhne will revert to his old professional love, finance and property. He might even revert to his old name, Christopher Paul-Huhne. It may not work for a politician, but out in the commercial world it has a ring about it.
