Almost 1,000 postal engineers and cleaners are set to strike across the country this Friday, December 21, which could delay deliveries of Christmas cards and online gift purchases.

Postmen and postwomen are not striking, but it is thought some of them may not cross picket lines.

The union members who clean, maintain and repair Royal Mail premises have voted 91 per cent in favour of strike action.

Friday's industrial action will mainly affect sorting office equipment, as there will be no engineers to fix machinery should it break down

The engineers and cleaners are employed by Romec, a company jointly owned by the Royal Mail and Balfour Beatty Workplace.

Romec employs 4,300 people, including 1,000 technicians and 2,500 cleaners, and have a turnover in excess of £195 million.

The strike action, which could disrupt online gift shoppers expecting parcels from Amazon and other retailers, centres on a row over pay rises, with Romec offering 1.5 per cent to their workers.

In a statement, Communication Workers' Union national negotiator Ray Ellis said: 'The company’s behavior has been totally hypocritical and the workers are furious.

'We have been taking part in talks this week at the conciliation service ACAS and urge management to avoid the strike by upping their offer.'

Billy Hayes, CWU general secretary, said: 'The whole union is behind the Romec workers.'

In one of the biggest disruptions, Tube drivers will stage three strikes, including one on Boxing Day, in a row over Bank Holiday pay

Industrial action will also affect travellers this Christmas, as militant rail unions are set to stage a nationwide series of strikes.

Walkouts are planned across the holiday period, as families visit relatives, shoppers flock to Boxing Day sales and fans travel to major sporting events.

The strikes will hit CrossCountry trains from Penzance to Aberdeen, sleeper services between London and Scotland, the London Underground and the Newcastle Metro.

Rail union RMT is also planning action on Friday against CrossCountry – which carries 90,000 passengers a day. It is in dispute with the firm over what the union claims has been a ‘comprehensive breakdown in industrial relations’ .

In the North East, cleaners working for Churchill’s, the contractors, on Tyne and Wear Metro are to hold a 72-hour strike over low pay starting at 10.30pm on Sunday.

In Scotland, RMT members working for ScotRail will on Friday hold the first of two 24-hour Christmas strikes over what the union says is ‘victimisation’ of one of its members. The second walkout is set to hit Christmas Eve services.
