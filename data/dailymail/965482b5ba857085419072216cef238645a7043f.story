A magazine has been forced to apologise for using a 'skeleton'-like model in its latest issue.

The publisher of Danish magazine, Cover, Malene Malling called it a 'sad day' after online backlash and anger over the decision to feature Lululeika in a fashion feature. 

Malling said: 'I have not lived up to my responsibility as a publisher, woman and mother and am truly sorry.' 

This picture of the 16-year-old model Lululeika that was published in Danish magazine Cover that has caused outrage and lead the magazines founder to apologise 

The picture was originally posted on Reddit where many users rushed to comment on the appearance of the 16-year-old model whose full name is Lululeika Ravn Liep.

One named 'Keepitgoinglouder' said: 'I totally understand that in fashion, clothes tend to "hang" better on slender frames but this is taking it way too far. 

'Not only does she look like a skeleton, her whole complexion and facial expression makes it seem like she is near death. Glad to hear the editor took responsibility for this poor choice.'

Another named 'Lincolnparkafterdark,' said: 'I genuinely don't understand how a look this emaciated can be considered beautiful or fashionable or sexy in any country/culture. 

'This poor girl clearly needs help. It's obvious she's not healthy. It's so detrimental to young girls around the world to glamorize eating disorders.'

Cover magazine issued an apology after featuring the slim model however the magazine's fans are still unimpressed by their actions

Lululeika has previously featured in a Louis Vuitton show, modelling their Spring Summer 2015 collection at Paris Fashion Week in October 

Indeed, many have been quick to point out that the model herself should not be the subject of the negative comments. 

Her agency Scoop have been quick to defend her saying: 'The model is in a bad time in her life after losing two members of her family. 

'So we ask that all comments are made ​​with respect and without calling [her] sick, because it is not.' 

Lululeika has also previously worked for French fashion house Louis Vuitton. She modeled their SS15 collection in Paris in October.  

After the apology was posted to the magazine's Facebook many of their readers were still not happy. 

One woman commented: '[It is] Super easy for you to show all of them (us) who doubt the sincerity of your excuse that you really mean what you say.

'You donate simply last year's profits to the Mental Health Foundation or the Association on Eating Disorders, so they can do something for all the girls daily battling anorexia !!!! [sic].' 

The magazine claims that they aim to promote different types of women and says that it is a 'sad day' in that they have to apologise 

Whilst another said: 'Anorexia is a very complex medical and PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS with a HIGH MORTALITY, which incidentally affects both girls and boys! 

'Severe malnutrition can cause irreparable damage to all organs !!! This is not a question of taste anymore, but ....... LIFE and DEATH!'

The Danish Tax Minister Benny Englebrecht was one of many who took to Facebook and to voice his disgust at the image saying: 'I seriously thought that the fashion industry had understood that anorexia is a problem that should be taken seriously.'

Lululeika herself has not  directly commented on the image. Femail spoke to Mary George at Beat, the UK's leading charity for the support of those suffering from or affected by eating disorders.

She said: 'Although we should remember that some models with a naturally low body weight are healthy this particular image looks unreal and it is indeed possible to be influenced by images that do not portray reality.'

Going on to add: 'People who are at risk, or already affected by an eating disorder can be triggered or maintained in the disorder by the images they see everywhere so we would urge any publisher to think long and hard about portraying such unhealthy ideals.' 

Malling said she had worked in magazines for more than ten years, adding: 'This time unfortunately made ​​a big mistake, I would apologise.'

She said: 'On the Cover, we have, in all the years, worked to show an expanded beauty ideal. [To] show that you can be beautiful in various ages and various sizes. 

'We have always sought to work with healthy girls. Just two months ago we had plus-size model Diana Graham on the front of the Cover, so it is certainly a subject we focus on.'
