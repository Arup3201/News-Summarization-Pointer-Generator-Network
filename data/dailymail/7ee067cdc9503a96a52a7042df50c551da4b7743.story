Another victim: Liz Seccuro (pictured) was raped at University of Virginia fraternity Phi Kappa Psi in 1984, the same house fingered in the recent Rolling Stone article now under question

While the Rolling Stone article about an alleged gang-rape at University of Virginia fraternity Phi Kappa Psi is under question, there's one detail from the story not in dispute - the fact that a woman was raped in a strikingly similar manner at the same house three decades ago.

A Phi Psi brother was convicted of the crime. 

Victim Liz Seccuro, has spoken out in the wake of the Rolling Stone article and it's subsequent backlash, to tell The Daily Beast her own horrifying account of rape at the fraternity when she was a student at UVA in the mid-1980s. 

She published a book on the experience titled 'Crash Into Me' in 2011. 

Earlier this month, she defended victim 'Jackie' and the rush to fact-check the UVA junior's rape account, who Rolling Stone admits was not properly vetted in an apology letter.

While Phi Psi is named as the fraternity where Jackie was gang-raped in the article, it is now unclear if she was assaulted at that house since she came out to say she wasn't certain it happened at that specific fraternity.  

Seccruro though remembers exactly where her rape took place, and even knew one of per perpetrators. 

She was 17-years-old in August 1984 when she left her home in Rye, New York to study English at the Charlottesville, Virginia university.

On the night of October 5, 1984, just five weeks into college, one of Seccuro's new friends Jim (name changed) asked her to be his date to a rush event at the Phi Psi fraternity. 

She agreed, wanting to help her fellow freshman get into the exclusive all-boys club,  and helped him talk to brothers at the event with a band, dancing and free booze. 

But the two got separated when they ventured upstairs and Jim was invited into a room to smoke marijuana with some of the brothers.

While sitting on a couch, waiting for her date to return, Seccuro says two brothers at the bar asked her if she wanted a drink and she agreed.  

But things took a bad turn when she started to feel 'dizzy and disconnected' after drinking the so-called 'house special'.

'Suddenly, after a few sips of the green drink, I noticed something wrong. Extraordinarily wrong. I could not feel my hands or feet. My arms and legs began to feel numb. I started to panic, breathing shallowly and rapidly,' Seccuro recalled.

It was then that a tall brown-haired man with wire rimmed glasses sat down to talk to her, and she told him she was thinking about going home because she was feeling tired. 

Scene: Seccuro says she was gang-raped by three men at the Phi Psi house just five weeks after starting at UVA in 1984. She later brought one of her rapists to justice when he wrote a letter apologizing to her for the incident, which was used as evidence

History repeating: Seccuro's story is strikingly similar to that of 'Jackie' (pictured) the current UVA junior who told a horrifying account of gang-rape at the campus fraternity to Rolling Stone. Jackie's account is now being torn apart after it was revealed she wasn't completely certain the rape happened at Phi Psi

Instead, he forcefully grabbed her arm and said 'I have something to show you' before lifting her off the couch and taking her to a bedroom.  

Seccuro says that the man made her sit on his lap and began reading her poetry. Panicked, she managed to escape and run down the hall to the room where her handbag had been stored. 

The door was locked so she began yelling and kicking the door. That's when the music turned up and a brother behind the bar picked her up and took her back to the bespectacled man. 

The bespectacled man then pinned her down by the arms and legs and raped her repeatedly, despite her protestations. 

Seccuro says she passed out from the fear and pain but woke up a few times during the night, when she heard voices, slamming doors and felt hands on her. 

The next morning she woke up on an orange sofa across the hallway from where the rape occurred, and quickly fled the house, but not before sifting through her rapist's mail, identifying him as a student named William Beebe. 

She then walked to the University of Virginia medical center for treatment, but after sitting in the emergency room for several hours a nurse came up and told she would need to travel to Richmond or Washington, DC if she wanted the necessary 'tests'.  

Defeated, Seccuro walked back to her dorm room where she had to wait a full three days to report the incident to the then-Dean of Students Robert Canevari. 

Sorry: While her initial attempts to bring her rapists to justice in 2006 were flouted by the university, Seccuro's rapist William Beede was sentenced in 2007 after sending her the confession letter

Still bruised and battered, Seccuro says her Monday meeting with Canevari did not go well. 

'He dismissed me and told me I had “had sex with a young man and didn’t want my parents to know I wasn’t a good girl.” He suggested I needed mental help, and offered to help me transfer to another college,' Seccuro says. 

Canevari also told Seccuro that she could not report the rape to the Charlottesville Police, since it wasn't in their 'jurisdiction' - a statement she would learn was completely untrue years later.

He referred Seccuro to another administrator, Dean Sybil Todd, who was a bit more understanding. 

Dean Todd arranged for her to be interviewed by a student journalist to write about the attack for the campus paper and continued to be a personal ally throughout the rest of her college career.

She also helped Seccuro tell her story to campus police Captain Michael Sheffield, who promised to investigate the attack.

'Nothing ever came of the “investigation.” I called Sheffield’s office regularly, and I was routinely told someone would get back to me...No one ever called me back.'

Seccuro graduated from UVA in 1988 with a degree in English literature, but no justice for her crime.

Short sentence: Beede (pictured) only spent less than six months in prison, because his 10 year sentence was mostly suspended 

Her case took an unexpected turn in September 2005 though, when her rapist sent her an apology letter, as part of his Alcoholics Anonymous program. 

She took the letter to the Charlottesville Police and it was then that she learned that local authorities did indeed have the power to investigate crimes at the fraternity and that there is no statue of limitations on rape in Virginia.

Beebe was arrested in January 2006 and charged with two felony counts of rape. 

During the grand jury process, Seccuro learned that Beebe wasn't the only man who violated her that night. Private investigators hired by Beebe's defense attorneys tracked down two men who also allegedly raped her and when they appeared before the jury, they pleaded the Fifth Amendment to every question.

'Police contacted dozens of witnesses from that night. Many were interviewed. Many declined to be interviewed. The bonds of Phi Kappa Psi brotherhood were too strong to break. There were witnesses who are sons of powerful men; congressmen, senators, captains of industry. It was—and is—heartbreaking.'

Beebe struck a plea deal with prosecutors two weeks before his case was set to go to trial, in which the rape charges were dropped and instead he pleaded guilty to a single charge of aggravated sexual battery. 

He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but only ended up serving less than six months because most of the sentence was suspended. 

However, Seccuro believes that justice was served and says she's forgiven Beebe for the vile crime he committed against her. 

'I forgave William Beebe decades ago.... I do not forgive those who saw the attacks and have refused to cooperate with law enforcement. These are men who now have wives and children, and their silence so many years later shows how morally bankrupt they remain. I cannot begin to understand it,' she says. 

Allies: Seccuro says former UVA Dean Sybil Todd (left) helped her deal with the rape in college, and that Charlottesville Chief of Police Timothy Longo (right) helped her bring her attacker to justice in 2006

Seccuro adds that she is glad she came forward and had her rapist tried, because it gives other rape victims like her hope of justice.

'When I think of the many rape victims who never come forward, who have been silenced in the same fashion, I am saddened. When colleges and universities systematically lie to victims and shuttle them toward administrators whose jobs depend upon protecting the good names of their employers, all of us lose. 

'But I fought, and I fought hard, so that others after me have hope, and a chance.'

Seccuro spoke out earlier this month to defend Jackie's story to Time magazine, repeating the statistic that false rape stories are extremely rare

'Wholesale doubt or dismissal of a rape account because it sounds “too bad to be true” is ridiculous. Is it easier to believe a rape by a single stranger upon a woman in a dark alley? What about marital rape? What if a prostitute is raped? Just how bad was it? We should not have a rape continuum as part of the dialogue, ever.'

Forgiveness: Seccuro says she's forgiven her rapist, but not the men who witnessed the attack and said nothing
