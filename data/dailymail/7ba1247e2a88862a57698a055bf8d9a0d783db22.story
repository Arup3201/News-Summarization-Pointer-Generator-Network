A teacher who admitted taking sexual photographs of her students has tried to blame it on a long list of excuses, including high cholesterol levels, the menopause, an online love interest and aching joints.

Kimberly Crain, 49, from Shawnee, has already admitted making and distributing child pornography, and submitted a letter to Pottawatomie County District Court in a bid to avoid serving jail time.

The former elementary school teacher faces life in prison but is appealing for probation. She passed on the images to retired professor of early childhood development Gary Doby, of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, who has already been sentenced to 18 life terms.

Her full list of excuses includes: Depression, menopause, her online love interest, her husband ignoring her, hypnosis, weight gain, increasingly high 
cholesterol levels, chronic joint and muscle pain, panic attacks, sleep 
deprivation and a rapidly changing hormonal balance.

Crain mainly blames her 'cyber-lover' Doby, 66, who she would email the explicit photographs to.

According to koco.com, in her letter to the court she says: 'I found myself giving in to all he wanted.

'Gary briefly spoke of his fascinations with young girls, but I didn't see it as a fetish.

'He said it made him smile and feel good, so I wanted to continue to keep him happy.'

At the end of the letter, she asks for a 'second chance' to prove herself to the community.

Nine students had previously testified that she took photos of them in her classroom and during a 
pizza party at her home in their underwear and also allowed them to be 
secretly videoed while changing.

The students, aged eight to 11, took 
the witness stand in Pottawatomie County District Court during a 
preliminary hearing.

The students testified that Crain took photos of them in her classroom and during a pizza party at her home while they were wearing tank tops and underwear.

A nine-year-old old girl testified that Crain told her to open her legs and do various dances that Crain then photographed.

'There was so much I can't remember,'
the girl said when District Attorney Richard Smothermon asked her how 
many photographs were taken.

In another incident, the girl said that Crain drew smiley faces on the chest of a shirt the girl was wearing.

The girl said she also talked to Doby via computer in Crain's classroom.

'He would say "you are beautiful",' the girl said. 'Sometimes he would have a shirt on, sometimes he wouldn't.'

Smothermon asked the girl if she wanted to change clothes at Crain's home.

'I really didn't, because I felt uncomfortable,' the girl replied.

Among
the evidence introduced in the case was copies of photographs Crain 
took of the girls, including photos taken by a hidden video camera that 
showed the girls naked as they changed clothes.

Another former student testified that she and other students went to Crain's home around Christmas for a pizza party where they changed into panties and bras, then hid behind a couch when the pizza deliveryman arrived.

'We covered ourselves up so he couldn't see us,' the girl said.

Several of the students said Crain told them not to tell their parents what they had done.

A ten-year-old girl said she reported what had happened to her parents and that her mother cried when she heard.

'She went to the bathroom and cried,' the girl said.

FBI Special Agent Andrew Farabow testified that he examined laptop computers used by Crain and Doby and found images of child and adult pornography.
