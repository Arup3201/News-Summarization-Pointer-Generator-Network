These beautiful images might look like a terrifying battle between two of the planet's most ferocious beasts, but the two cats are actually a bickering mother and cub.

The pair were captured pawing and leaping in the air in a friendly scrap as they enjoyed a playfight in the wilderness.

Photographer Marlon du Toit shot the rare sighting in Singita Sabi Sand, South Africa.

Photographer Marlon du Toit shot the rare sighting of the family of leopards in a moment he described as 'breathtaking'

Marlon said: 'There is so much more to simply taking a photograph. A story needs to be told.

'This was an absolutely breathtaking moment. Everything in nature has purpose and reason.

'Movement beckons the leopards' attention and his eyes light up, ears cock forward and whiskers stand erect.'

Leopards are predators which can run up to 36mph in order to catch their prey

Leopards are skilled tree climbers and are even able to climb when carrying the carcasses of their prey in their mouths

Nine lives: Leopards are expert tree climbers and can jump from great heights without injuring themselves

Marlon spends most of his day on safari and says he witnesses the secret lives of some of the most amazing creatures.

Most of the animals are accustomed to the safari jeeps and this allows Marlon to step into the personal space of lions, leopards and many more.

Leopards can grow up to 65 inches and can weigh up to 200 lbs.
