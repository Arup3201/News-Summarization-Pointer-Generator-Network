A supermarket is offering shoppers 'free erections' after a sign was wrongly translated into Welsh

A supermarket is offering shoppers 'free erections' after a sign was wrongly translated into Welsh.

The sign on a cash machine at the Tesco store in Aberystwyth should read 'arian am ddim' which means free money.

But the supermarket blundered by saying 'codiad am ddim' which means free erections.

The error was seen by Welsh speaking Aberystwyth councillor Ceredig Davies who said: 'There were a few titters in the town so I went down to have a look myself.

'Ten out of ten to Tesco for considering the Welsh language.

'But perhaps they should have had it checked by an actual Welsh speaker before putting the signs on the machines.

'People get their Welsh translations wrong from time to time but this one is hilarious.'

Managers at the Tesco Express store in the university town took the sign down and were investigating the mistake.

But shoppers believe the supermarket used Google to translate - and got it badly wrong.

Garin Fitter, 18, whose girlfriend works at the new store, said: 'I am not sure how they came up with because anyone with a basic understanding of Welsh would know it is the wrong word.

'They must have used Google translate.

'I think it's quite funny but I know some people might be offended they didn't bother to check they had got it right.' 

The Tesco social media team saw the funny side of the incident, tweeting: 'We’ve taken down the sign and will replace it with the correct translation. We appreciate this is a sensitive area.'

In 2010 Swansea Council sent an email to its in-house translations service to have a road sign - 'No entry for heavy goods vehicles. Residential site only' - translated into Welsh.

The only problem was that the Welsh translator wasn't in at the time. An automated email response was sent to council officials who believed it was exactly what they needed.

But in fact it stated: 'I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated.'

Unaware of the real meaning of the message, authorities had it printed on the road sign under the English.

A council spokesman said the sign was removed as soon as it was notified of the blunder.
