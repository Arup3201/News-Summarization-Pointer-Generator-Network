A Japanese video commercial featuring a woman exercising with ‘human poodles’ has resurfaced ten years after it was filmed – and become a viral hit.

The YouTube clip was made by Panasonic ahead of the 2004 Summer Olympics and shows Californian-born Japanese model Mariko Takahashi doing a 1980s-style aerobic exercise accompanied by poodles.

Kicking the surreal-level up a notch – even for Japan – Ms Takahashi sports strange ‘Popeye’ muscles as she speaks of how to lose weight and takes the viewer through the exercises.

The clip, made by art director and commercial film director Nagi Noda, is a word-for-word copy of a workout video made by motivational speaker and 90s fitness celebrity Susan Powter.

The poodles are, of course, humans, who had dog heads added later using CGI, and were used by Noda as she found the way poodle fur is groomed to resemble human muscles.

Internet implodes: The surreal video features an English-speaking model with strange Popeye-like muscles working out with a group of poodles

Want to look like me? Although the video looks like it was filmed in 1985, it is just over ten years old, filmed ahead of the 2004 Summer Olympics

Where else: Although the video is in English, the ten-part promotional workout spoof was made in Japan

Too weird: The aerobics poodles are, of course, humans, and the poodle heads were added later using CGI

The strange video's director, Nagi Noda, explained that she decided to use poodles as the way the fur is groomed looks like muscles

It cannot be unseen: A total of ten videos were made by Panasonic in 2004, although this appears to be the only one which had gone viral

What makes the video, if possible, even more strange is that it follows the exact script of an exercise video made by Susan Powter, who became famous in the 90s through her weight-loss infomercials
