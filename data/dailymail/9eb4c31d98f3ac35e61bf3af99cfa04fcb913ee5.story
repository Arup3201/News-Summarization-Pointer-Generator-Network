A legend has grown up over the years that Rory McIlroy is a fair-weather golfer. A legend, it has to be said, that McIlroy has contributed handsomely towards both in word and hapless deed when the elements have turned unkind.

So to Wentworth on Friday, where the forecast McIlroy had seen first thing predicting a pleasant 19 degrees turned out to be way wide of the mark, with the reality being a cold, wet and thoroughly miserable day.

Thirty minutes after the end of his  second round, he still had no feeling in the little finger on his left hand and the thumb on his right. At the par-four  seventh hole, he had thinned a greenside bunker shot so badly he ended up with a double-bogey six.

Bad start: Rory McIlroy began his round with back-to-back bogeys at Wentworth on Friday

Cheer up, Rory: The Northern Irishman made three birdies in the last four holes to end on one-under par

In short, and given all the other  
distractions going on in his life, if ever there was a back nine to stop
 drying the clubs with his towel and chuck it in instead, this was it.

Happily,
 and to the delight of the  thousands who trudged through the mud to 
watch him, that was precisely what did not happen at the BMW PGA 
Championship. On a course where he has no track record, the 25-year-old 
from  Northern Ireland summoned  up commendable resolve to play the 
final seven holes in four under par.

To
 put that sequence into  perspective, Ernie Els, the man who redesigned 
this West course in 2010 and playing alongside him, completed them in 
three over.

It all added up
 to a gutsy 71 for McIlroy and a heartening  two-round total of 139 
blows. Far from a weekend off, which has been his lot here for the past 
two years, he has actually moved into the thick of contention on five 
under par.

Moving on: McIlroy split from Caroline Wozniacki earlier this week with the pair due to get married

Lining it up: McIlroy is five shots behind leaders Thomas Bjorn and Shane Lowry

After starting 
the week with one dramatic statement, announcing he had split from 
fiancee Caroline Wozniacki, he has put himself into position to make 
another. There’s never a dull moment with the Northern Irishman, is 
there?

How characteristic 
of his rollercoaster life that he should follow up his holed wedge shot 
for an eagle two at the seventh on Thursday with a holy hash of a bunker
 shot for a score no fewer than four shots worse on Friday.

At
 least he was consistent on the other hole where he claimed an eagle on 
day one, the par-five 12th. This time he followed that up with a 
seven-iron to 12 feet and rolled in the putt for a matching three.

McIlroy
 bogeyed the 13th but birdied three of the last four holes to lie joint 
fifth on a leaderboard where the Dane Thomas Bjorn has been joined by 
Irishman Shane Lowry.

Bjorn
 had a rough start but his play matched the weather as he improved the 
longer the day went on. He finished with a 72 to stand on 10 under, 
while Lowry birdied both of the last two holes to follow up his 
impressive opening 64 with a 70.   

On the move: McIlroy has moved into contention for the Wentworth title with an impressive back nine

The
 only player to beat McIlroy in his half of the draw was Spaniard Rafael
 Cabrera-Bello, who is on six under after a second-round 73. The one 
player to match him was feisty Swede Jonas Blixt, who showed his taste 
for the big time with his runner-up finish in the Masters last month.

‘I really want to make Europe’s Ryder Cup team,’ he said, and he’s showing it.

An
 exciting weekend is in prospect, with Luke Donald going for his third 
win in four years while the 18th green on Sunday could see the crowning 
of a new world  No 1 once more.

Henrik
 Stenson shot 71 to stand on five under and he is nicely placed to limit
 Adam Scott’s time at the top to one week and emulate the achievement of
 Donald himself, who went to world No 1 by defeating Lee Westwood to win
 this title in 2011.

Donald
 showed his liking for these acres once more with a fine round of 67, 
featuring an amazing run of five threes in a row from the eighth, 
representing three birdies, one eagle and a par. He is six under.

Perched
 on the periphery are the English triumvirate of Ian Poulter and Lee 
Westwood on two under, with Justin Rose a further shot adrift.
