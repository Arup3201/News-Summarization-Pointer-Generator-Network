An adorable pit bull returned to a South Carolina high kill shelter for being too flatulent has been given a new lease on life this week.

One-year-old Misty has gotten a new foster family and will soon leave Greenville County Pet Rescue, where 23 percent of dogs are euthanized and dogs of her breed are often overlooked.

Her good fortune has come no thanks to the people who adopted her in June and then came back, dog in tow, because Misty happened to pass a little too much gas.

Saved: One-year-old pit bull mix Misty was returned to the high kill South Carolina shelter where she was adopted last month by an owner who thought she passed too much gas. Now she's been given a new lease on life

The dog- and people-friendly pooch was simply given back June 26, the Examiner originally reported.

Thanks to the uproar that followed the report, offers to adopt Misty poured in.

Greenville County Pet Rescue spokesperson Susan Bufano told HuffPost the good news.

'We are still evaluating her and have a foster for her,' said Bufano. 'We anticipate finding her a home.'

The Greenville facility adopts out some 6,000 dogs and cats each year.
