Rafael Nadal gritted his teeth, wiped his brow and looked to the sky after  winning on grass for the first time in two years.

He had become only the 11th player in the open era to win 700 tour-level matches but his expression told a story of relief, not records, after he battled back to beat Martin Klizan 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.

The murmurs began among the Centre Court crowd as the Slovakian, unknown to all but the tennis fanatics in attendance, served out to take the first set over the world No 1. After being bundled out in the first round at Wimbledon last year by tour journeyman Steve Darcis, was Nadal about to take another early bow?

Tough test: Nadal recovered from a slow start to make it through to the second round

The Spaniard shuffled to his seat, 
peeled off his top — much to the delight of some spectators — and could 
have been forgiven for posing himself that very question.

But
 doubts like that are for mere mortals, not for great warriors like 
Nadal, who denied his thoughts had wandered to Darcis or Lukas Rosol, 
the Czech who knocked him out in 2012.

‘When
 you are in a match, you are not thinking about what happened last year 
or two years ago,’ he said, ‘You’re thinking about the next point, 
you’re thinking about finding a solution for that match.’ In a  curious 
twist, Nadal will face Rosol in the next round, the same stage at which 
the Czech triumphed in a five-set blockbuster. But Nadal is not one to 
entertain talk of bogeymen. ‘I lost because he’s a good player,’ he 
said. ‘He plays very well on this surface and it will be a tough match 
again. I know if I want to have chances to win, I need to play very 
well.’

Klizan might be 51 
in the world — 50 places behind Nadal — but he is no slouch, as 
evidenced by his ATP Newcomer of the Year award in 2012 and the way he 
attacked from the first point.

The
 24-year-old immediately raced to three break points, which Nadal saved.
 But the Spaniard was broken in the ninth game of the set and looked 
jaded, perhaps feeling the effects of the run to his 15th Grand Slam 
title at Roland Garros earlier this month.

Pure delight: Nadal celebrates his win as he looks to win another Wimbledon title

Effort: Nadal needed to draw on his reserves to book his place in the next round

VIDEO Wimbledon Day 2 review

In
 Halle last week he lost to world No 78 Dustin Brown and admitted he is 
struggling to make the transition from clay to grass with only two weeks
 between the conclusion of the French Open and the start of Wimbledon.

‘Mentally
 and physically you play a long clay-court season,’ he said. ‘If you are
 able to win Roland  Garros, you have already played for a long time at 
your top level —  mentally and physically. It is  normal to go down a  
little bit. The grass deserves to have one more week, as it will next 
year. For the players who are able to play very well and long on clay, 
having this extra week will help.

‘It
 is always a bit more dangerous physically when you are finishing Roland
 Garros on Sunday and you have to play again on Wednesday.

‘It’s
 tough to make the right preparation for the tournament. You don’t have a
 lot of time to prepare and to play matches on grass but the best 
players are able to do it.’

Nadal
 looked the least comfortable of the top four in the opening round but 
once he has battled through the early stages and found his feet on the 
greens of SW19, you sense a third Wimbledon title could be on the cards.
 He would become only the  second man after Bjorn Borg to win at Roland 
Garros and Wimbledon in the same year on three occasions.

Pumped up: Nadal was his usual expressive self on court

This
 was a workmanlike and confidence-boosting  victory for Nadal after more
 than three hours on court but  there were some magic moments. In the 
fourth set he slipped, got up and smacked a backhand diagonally which 
dipped inside the line to set up a break point, which he duly converted 
for the double break.

Klizan
 fought valiantly, got one break back and forced Nadal to save a break 
point as he served  out for the match. First round  victories for world 
No 1s are rarely  celebrated so expansively.

lLleyton
 Hewitt completed his 13th first-round victory at Wimbledon with a 6-2, 
6-7 (14-16), 6-1, 6-4 win over world No 120 Michal Przysiezny.

Now
 aged 33, this could be his final competitive visit here and he will 
face against 15th seed and 2013 semi-finalist Jerzy Janowicz tomorrow.

Close: Martin Klizan couldn't keep up his effort and lost in four sets

The
 Australian made it clear after his victory  how much he enjoys  
Wimbledon, saying: ‘It doesn’t get any  better than playing in this 
tournament, Physically I’ve come through a few things over the last 
couple of years with surgeries ...but it’s all worth it out here.’

Only
 three times in his 16 visits has Hewitt fallen at the first hurdle, and
 in 2002 he won the title,  beating the now-retired David Nalbandian.

There
 are only four other former champions in the men’s draw, and the one in 
Hewitt’s quarter is  seven-time winner Roger Federer.

‘I
 came out being really aggressive and played a great first set, and then
 it’s always tough because you’ve got to start again.’ Hewitt said. 
‘Fitness-wise I felt fine.’
