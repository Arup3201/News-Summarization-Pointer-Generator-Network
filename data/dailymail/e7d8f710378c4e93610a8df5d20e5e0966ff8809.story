Malware: Patients trying to access NHS Choices have been bombarded with advertisements

Patients trying to access the NHS Choices website have been bombarded with advertisements and malware after a coding error.

Although the NHS says the problem is now fixed, there are fears that thousands of people may have already had their computers infected by viruses, potentially compromising their personal information.

The problems were first spotted over the weekend, with thousands of users subsequently taking to social networks to complain about malware-infested pages and links to irrelevant advertisements.

Writing on Reddit, a user going by the name Muzzers wrote: 'While attempting to access flu shot information I stumbled on a page which redirected me to an advert. Digging a bit deeper I found hundreds more pages which redirect either to an advert or to malware-infested pages.'

In total around 800 pages are believed to have been affected, although site administrators insist the problem was not caused by hackers.

A spokeswoman for the Health and Social Care Information Centre, which runs the NHS website, said the problems were caused by a misplaced letter 's' at the coding stage, with a developer accidentally typing googleaspis.com instead or googleapis.com.

The spelling error initially had little or no effect for visitors to the NHS Choices website, but on Sunday the incorrect web address was registered as a new website in the Czech Republic.

Patients were then redirected to the Czech version of the website, which had been loaded with adverts and malware.

Internet security expert Graham Cluey said the NHS' explanation was unusual but added that if it turned out to be factually accurate, then anybody who inadvertently downloaded malware could be at risk

Speaking to the Independent, internet security expert Graham Cluey said the explanation was unusual but added that if it turned out to be factually accurate, then anybody who inadvertently downloaded malware could be at risk.

Mr Cluey said: 'I'm surprised by that explanation... what often happens is that a hacker will find a weak point and inject a piece of code to exploit it and set up a domain name. Otherwise whoever registered the domain name in the Czech Republic must have scanned the code, which few do, or registered numerous websites in the hope of getting lucky.'

In a statement the Health and Social Care Information Centre said: 'An internal coding error has caused an incorrect redirect on some pages on NHS Choices since Sunday evening. Routine security checks alerted us to the problem on Monday morning at which point we identified the problem and corrected the code.'

The statement added: 'NHS Choices has conducted an investigation of the adverts that some users were taken to and found nothing malicious.'
