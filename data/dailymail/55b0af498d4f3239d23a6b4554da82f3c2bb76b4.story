The UN has appealed for $16.4billion (£10.4billion) to provide aid to nearly 60 million people worldwide next year, with almost half the amount aimed at helping victims of Syria's drawn-out conflict.

'The rising scale of need is outpacing our capacity to respond,' warned United Nations humanitarian chief Valerie Amos, stressing that 2014 has been marked by a sharp rise in the number of people affected by violent conflicts. 

The global appeal from UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations aims to gather funds to help at least 57.5 million of the most vulnerable across 22 countries.

The global appeal from UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations aims to gather funds to help at least 57.5 million of the most vulnerable across 22 countries. Syria is earmarked for $7.2billion, Ukraine $189million and Afghanistan $405million. Iraq, meanwhile, should receive $1.2billion, the organisation said

The UN says that $2.8billion is needed to help those caught in the Syrian civil war. PIctured is a Syrian boy being treated at a makeshift hospital in the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Douma

Monday's appeal did not however include the needs in Djibouti and the nine countries in Africa's Sahel region, including Nigeria and Mali, which will be addressed in a separate appeal in February, the UN said.

A full $7.2billion of the amount requested for 2015 will be aimed at helping an estimated 18.2 million people victimised by Syria's bloody civil war, which erupted in March 2011.

The appeal is calling for $2.8billion to help 12.2million people inside the war-ravaged country next year, including 7.6million people who have been internally displaced.

Another $4.4 million will be needed to help more than three million Syrian refugees and some three million vulnerable people in overwhelmed host communities in neighbouring countries, the appeal said.

Helping millions of people affected by other crises will also require a large cash injection next year, with Syria's neighbour Iraq figuring high on the list.

The crises in Central African Republic and South Sudan are also listed in the appeal, as is the spiralling conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Crises in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, the occupied Palestinian territories, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen will also require funds next year.

'This is not business as usual in the humanitarian world,' said Antonio Guterres, head of the UN refugee agency.

The amount requested for 2015 dwarfs the $12.9billion requested last December in the initial appeal for 2014.

Throughout a year that has seen millions more people flee violence and become dependent on aid to survive, those need estimates have since swelled to $17.9billion to help over 76 million people.

Only 52 percent of that updated appeal has been funded, the UN said, highlighting a growing gap between needs and the resources available to cover them.

However, Amos announced that an emergency appeal to the public had closed a $64-million funding shortfall that caused the UN World Food Programme last week to suspend food aid to 1.7 million Syrian refugees.

Earlier Russia demanded an explanation for Israeli airstrikes on two areas near Damascus, while the Syrian and Iranian foreign ministers called it an act of aggression that proves Israel was 'in the same trench' with extremist groups fighting the Syrian government.

Israeli warplanes struck near Damascus' international airport on Sunday, as well as outside a town close to the Lebanese border.

The attacks are unlikely to have a big impact. Israel has already struck inside Syria on several occasions in the course of the country's chaotic civil war, including a series of airstrikes near Damascus in May 2013. Those strikes, according to Israeli officials, targeted shipments of Iranian-made Fateh-110 missiles bound for Israel's arch foe - the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group.

Syria's reaction has been relatively mute; in previous cases, Damascus has vowed to retaliate without carrying out any such action.

The Syrian government said Sunday's attacks caused only material damage. Israel has not confirmed the strikes, and it was not immediately clear what they targeted, although activists said they hit weapons depots.

The United Nations children's agency UNICEF declared 2014 a devastating year for children on Monday with as many as 15 million caught in conflicts in Central African Republic, Iraq, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and the Palestinian territories.

UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said the high number of crises meant many of them were quickly forgotten or failed to capture global headlines, such as in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

Globally, UNICEF said some 230 million children were living in countries and regions affected by armed conflict.

'Children have been killed while studying in the classroom and while sleeping in their beds; they have been orphaned, kidnapped, tortured, recruited, raped and even sold as slaves,' Lake said in a statement. 'Never in recent memory have so many children been subjected to such unspeakable brutality.'

Significant threats also emerged to children's health and well-being like the deadly outbreak of Ebola in the West African countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, which has left thousands orphaned and some 5 million out of school.

'Violence and trauma do more than harm individual children - they undermine the strength of societies,' Lake said.

In Central African Republic, where tit-for-tat sectarian violence has displaced one-fifth of the population, some 2.3 million children are affected by the conflict with up to 10,000 believed to have been recruited by armed groups during the past year and more than 430 killed or maimed, UNICEF said.

Some 538 children were killed and 3,370 injured in the Palestinian Gaza Strip during a 50-day war between Israeli troops and Hamas militants, it said.

In Syria, UNICEF said more than 7.3 million children have been affected by the civil war, including 1.7 million who fled the country. In neighboring Iraq an estimated 2.7 million children have been affected by conflict, it added, with at least 700 believed to have been maimed or killed this year.

'In both countries, children have been victims of, witnesses to and even perpetrators of increasingly brutal and extreme violence,' UNICEF said.

Some 750,000 children have been displaced in South Sudan with 320,000 living as refugees. The United Nations said more than 600 children have been killed and more than 200 maimed this year, while some 12,000 are being used by armed groups.
