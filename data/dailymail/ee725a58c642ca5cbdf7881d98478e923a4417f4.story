Wasps have reassured fans that Christian Wade is 'fine' after the England wing was involved in a car accident on Thursday morning.

In form Wade, 23, who scored two tries against Saracens in last weekend's Aviva Premiership opener at Twickenham, was being examined by medical staff as a precaution.

Wasps tweeted: 'Thanks for concerns re Christian Wade. He's ok, just shaken following car incident. Club doctor is checking him to be on safe side.'

Speedster Wade is hoping to force himself back into the England reckoning after missing much of last season with hamstring and foot injuries

A later tweet added: 'Wadey fine. Small collision at roundabout near his home. Thanks for queries.'

Wade spent nine months on the sidelines with a foot injury but returned at the weekend in the 34-28 loss to Saracens.

It was a frustrating season for Wade, who missed the 2013 Autumn Internationals with a hamstring injury and then damaged foot ligaments in November, ruling him out the Six Nations.
