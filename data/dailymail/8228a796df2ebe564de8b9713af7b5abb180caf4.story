This was the white wedding to end all white weddings, with even the guests being asked to become matching accessories to the bride.

But that dress code was about as modest as Tamara Ecclestone’s raunchy, bacchanalian wedding feast was to be.

But then with a £2.5 billion fortune, courtesy of her Formula 1 supremo father Bernie, her marriage to disgraced City stockbroker Jay Rutland was always going to be a little less than discreet.

Just married: Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland down rose champagne on a boat on the French Riviera on Wednesday

Introducing Mr and Mrs Rutland! Jay Rutland and new bride Tamara Ecclestone were seen celebrating their marriage at a beach party on Wednesday following their Tuesday nuptials

A stumble here and there: Tamara looks a little unsteady on her feet as the couple head down to the shore

That, of course, is not her style. 
Tamara subscribes to the ‘if you’ve got it, flaunt it’ philosophy, and 
she decided to mark the occasion with all the flamboyance money can buy.

The trouble is, of course, that you can’t buy taste.

Yesterday, the famous Grand-Hotel du 
Cap-Ferrat, once a byword for Hollywood glamour, was surrendering to 
Tamara’s new-money crowd.

From the bridegroom pulling on a large cigar 
to the muscled, tattooed guests and superannuated models, it was excess 
all areas.

The pictures barely do justice to the 
extraordinary scenes of yesterday’s beach party, which followed the 
sumptuous wedding of the previous night.

It-girl Caroline Stanbury, a former fancy of Prince Andrew, who was among the guests, tweeted: ‘Still partying, Essex style.’

There was plenty of laughter, of 
course, but perhaps the biggest smile came when the groom, who appeared 
to be wearing a platinum band on his finger to match Tamara’s wedding 
ring, declared of his new wife: ‘I admire her enormously. She does not 
show her wealth . . . Money is not important. It’s not what attracted me
 to her.’

Yet from the moment the two had 
touched down in the South of France, where one Rolls-Royce was waiting 
to whisk them away, and another to take their luggage, money was at the 
heart of the celebration.

On Tuesday, Tamara, 28, was sheathed 
in a couture Vera Wang gown complete with 30 ft train and crystals on 
the bodice.

And she took her first dance as Mrs Rutland to a cover of 
Lionel Richie’s Endless Love, performed live by Mariah Carey — hired for
 £2.5 million. Miss Carey also sang her new single Beautiful.

Sir Elton John also played an 
hour-long set on Monday night, dedicating his song Circle Of Life, from 
the soundtrack to Disney film The Lion King, to the happy couple. It is 
thought the singer was paid £1 million to attend.

Some guests claimed that Tamara had 
been irritated over absent guests of honour Princesses Beatrice and 
Eugenie and their mother, Sarah, Duchess of York — who failed to turn 
up.

A source said: ‘Tamara was livid that Fergie and her girls did not 
attend. For her fairytale wedding she wanted royalty to attend.’

But yesterday the bride was on the beach and turning up the volume.

Strict dress code: It looked like everyone had adhered to the white theme

Although it was undeniably lavish, 
exceeding its £5 million budget (the hotel rooms alone cost £600,000 and
 some observers put the total cost at around £7 million), some 
complained the three-day event failed to live up to expectations.

Some 
suggested that Mr Rutland’s guests behaved like ‘chavs’, jostling at the
 free bar, exposing their behinds and being sick after drinking too much
 alcohol.

Former financier Mr Rutland, 31, was 
banned for insider trading last year.

The Financial Services Authority 
reduced his fine from £160,000 to £30,000 due to his ‘financial 
circumstances’ and a ‘debilitating illness’.

He proposed within a month of meeting 
Miss Ecclestone in January this year.

In a 15-minute speech after the 
wedding ceremony, he explained how they fell in love, and praised her 
charity work, adding: ‘She owes her character to both her very 
remarkable parents.’

Miss Ecclestone helps fundraise for Great Ormond 
Street Hospital in London — by auctioning off her old clothes.

Mr Rutland joked about his bride’s 
notorious shopping habits. In the same evening, she wore three couture 
gowns — the Vera Wang dress, another long, white gown believed to be 
designed by Versace, and a short sequinned ‘flapper’ dress, thought to 
be by Alexander McQueen, for the dancing — but he denied she was 
‘shallow’, saying: ‘Tamara is the most caring and sensitive person I 
know by a mile.

'She is incredibly faithful and loyal, and is an 
incredible sister, daughter and friend. I love you with all my heart.’

Mr Rutland has reportedly signed a 
pre-nuptial agreement, meaning he will not take any of Miss Ecclestone’s
 wealth if they divorce.

But as her husband, he is now free to enjoy her
 opulent lifestyle to the full.

Miss Ecclestone’s sister Petra, 24, 
who also gave a speech, and her 55-year-old mother Slavica — who is 
divorced from Bernie — arrived on Sunday to help with preparations.

Loving the party: Tamara certainly seems like she is enjoying her time celebrating her big day

Mr Rutland’s friends from Essex 
mingled with Miss Ecclestone’s celebrity guests, who included model and 
TV presenter Lizzie Cundy, former It-girl Tamara Beckwith, Girls Aloud 
singer Nicola Roberts, actor Jason Statham and his girlfriend, model 
Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

By day, the younger guests partied 
next to the Grand Hotel’s 50 m infinity pool. The women had white 
dresses, the men white shorts and bare chests.

As the guests sipped on strawberry 
daiquiris and snacked on squid and oysters, nearby ramblers were heard 
complaining that the blaring music had disrupted the peaceful setting.

Yesterday, the wedding party dressed 
in white for a relaxed barbecue on Passable Beach, a mile away from the 
hotel.

However, some guests complained the event did not quite match up 
to the grandeur expected of the Cap-Ferrat, one of the most exclusive 
stretches of the French Riviera.

One said: ‘It felt like a free-for-all.
 It was all very informal and relaxed, and guests were left to go up and
 get their own drinks.

‘It was almost too informal. There were around 150 guests in total and around 40 to 50 were Jay’s friends.

‘It was very chavvy. During the 
three-day event, some of them were mooning — and one was seen throwing 
up after over-indulging. A lot of Tamara’s friends thought there might 
be eligible bachelors they could meet, but many couldn’t wait to leave 
the party.’

One figure remained above it all — 
Tamara’s billionaire father Bernie.

Despite reports to the contrary, the
 wedding was not funded by the deep pockets of Mr Rutland’s new 
father-in-law, 82-year-old Mr Ecclestone, who arrived late after 
attending the Montreal Grand Prix. ‘He’s not paying a penny towards it,’
 says a close friend. ‘Tamara has paid for it all herself.’
