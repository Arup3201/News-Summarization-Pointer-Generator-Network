Wedding woe: Samantha Lewin, 24, and Adam Patrick, 26, have nowhere to marry after their venue went bust a week before their big day

A young couple could lose their life savings and now have nowhere to marry after their wedding venue went bust a week before their big day.

Samantha Lewins, 24, and Adam Patrick, 26,  face a race against time to find a new venue and stand to lose up to £9,000 if they fail.

The couple, from Ellington, Northumberland, were due to marry on Sunday and had paid £5,000 to Longhirst Hall in Morpeth with a further £4,000 on a photographer, hairdresser and flowers.

But the venue went bust and they only found out when a friend told them on Facebook last Friday.

They have been told they will not recoup the £5,000 they paid to Longhirst Hall but are hoping the remaining £4,000 will not go to waste if they can find somewhere else to get married before the weekend.

Mother-of-two Miss Lewins said: 'We have been saving for our wedding for years. I was shocked and angry when I found out the news.

'They didn't even have the decency to call us, we found out from a friend on Facebook who used to work for the company.

'We had just paid our final bill and I had even emailed them a few changes and then next thing we knew they had gone into liquidation.

'We now have to find some way of getting things together so we can still have a wedding on Sunday.

'They promised me a stress-free and perfect day but that couldn't be further from the truth now.'

The couple now risk losing it all if they cannot find a new venue to accommodate them in time.

Longhirst Hall closed its doors last Friday after the company which operates the hotel went into liquidation and ceased trading.

Dozens of other couples were left in the dark after the company failed to tell anyone and even its staff had no idea it would no longer be open.

Samantha, who has two daughters with her husband to be Adam, said: 'We went along to the hall to see what was happening and there was just loads of staff standing outside equally as shocked as we were.

'These people had lost their jobs without any notice but their main worry was what was going to happen to all the weddings that had been booked in.

'My two daughters were so upset when they found out after they had been so excited to be flower girls.

'I have family coming from Scotland and York and lots of people had taken time off work and made plans, I don't know what to tell them now because I just don't know what we are going to do.

'The invitations went out months ago and we had paid it all off, it was just a matter of waiting for a few days.

'This is every bride's worst nightmare and now I don't even know if our wedding can go ahead.

'We have lost all of our savings paying for this and we won't get it back.'

Samantha and Adam are not the only couple to have their wedding day cancelled with dozens of other couples being booked up for months to come at the popular wedding venue.

Laura Guthzeit and her partner Paul were left with only 24 hours to rearrange their wedding when the hotel closed the day before they were due to tie the knot.

Laura, 29, had been getting pampered in Longhirst Hall's spa when the news broke.

Staff scrambled together to accommodate the couple and their guests in an empty room for the vows and then transferred them to Beamish Hall for their reception, meaning they didn't have to cancel.

Scott McGregor, director with Grainger Corporate Rescue & Recovery who are waiting to be appointed as liquidators, said: 'The company is in the process of going into liquidation at the moment. The company that operates the hotel at the moment, that company ceased trading and that's as much as we can say at the moment. The position appears to be that weddings are not going to take place, unfortunately.

'As of now the hotel is closed.'
