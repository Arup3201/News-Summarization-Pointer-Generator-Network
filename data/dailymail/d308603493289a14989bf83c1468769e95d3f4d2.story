A quarter of women surveyed said they are very anxious or have been diagnosed with depression

Alarming levels of poor health in women have been exposed in a report which reveals that millions are depressed, in constant pain  and inactive.

Nearly half say they suffer from a long-term illness or complaint, while a quarter say they are very anxious or have been diagnosed with depression.

A quarter are officially inactive – and do less than half an hour’s exercise a week – while only half are managing to do the bare minimum of physical exertion recommended by the Government.

The findings from the NHS’s annual health survey of 8,000 adults  - from the Health and Social Care Information Centre - come a day after figures revealed worryingly high levels of drinking among women over 65.

One in seven women of that age consumes alcohol at least five days a week, far more often than the under-40s, according to the Office for National Statistics. Experts are particularly concerned over the levels of inactivity, which have been linked to cancer, heart disease, depression and dementia.

Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘These disappointing findings show that even an  Olympic year could not boost  dwindling levels of physical activity in England.

Keeping active is one of the main ways we can  all reduce our risk of cardiovascular disease. Physical activity also helps children grow up fit and healthy and protects their hearts into adulthood.

‘We need to educate adults and children alike about the major health benefits of an active lifestyle.

'Being active doesn’t have to cost the earth and there are many activities the whole family can enjoy together, such as dancing, cycle rides or long walks.’

The NHS¿s annual health survey of 8,000 adults found almost half of women said they suffered from a long term illness or complaint

The survey also reveals that 23 per cent 
of women are depressed or anxious while 45 per cent suffer from a 
long-term health problem such as arthritis, diabetes, heart failure or 
asthma.

Figures are far lower in men – just 16 per cent suffer depression or anxiety and 36 per cent have a long standing health complaint.

Beth Murphy from Mind, the mental health charity, said: ‘This new survey suggests that many people are self-reporting poor mental health, anxiety and depression.

She added: ‘Whilst this research shows a difference between the numbers of men and women reporting mental health problems, we know that men are less likely to seek help.’

The survey involves asking lifestyle questions and taking measurements of height and weight of 8,000 adults and 2,000 children.

It also found that 25 per cent of women and 24 per cent of men were obese – and 14 per cent of children.

The Government recommends that adults do at least an hour and a half’s exercise a week which can include walking, gardening or housework, while children should do three hours.

But only 45 per cent of women manage this amount compared to 33 per cent of men.
