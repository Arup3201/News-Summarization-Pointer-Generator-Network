Art-lover Queen Letizia of Spain looked pretty as a picture at a new modern art exhibition in Madrid today.

Wearing a colour-blocked shift dress with a black section, blue side panel and white sleeves, the mother-of-two admired the works on display.

She was joined at the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair at the IFEMA exhibition site in the Spanish capital by her husband King Felipe.

The Spanish queen looked chic and colour co-ordinated in a shift dress, black leather clutch and suede shoes

The 42-year-old kept her accessories simple with discreet silver earrings and a black quilted leather clutch, while her dress was decorated with simple evenly-spaced studs.   

Ever keen to colour co-ordinate, the 42-year-old wore soft blue suede high heel court shoes 

King Felipe VI kept his look simple with his trademark grey suit with a subtle white check and a blue tie with a swirling paisley pattern.

The royals admired huge sculptures, including an untitled art work consisting of a  bronze swirl of metal extending out of a matte metal dome, alongside the nation's education, culture and sports minister Ignacio Wert and the Mayor of Madrid, Ana Botella. 

The event will run until 1 March, and features work by Colombian artists this year. 

The former journalist gazed at one piece made up of a vast canvas covered in red paint, nailed to the wall, which apppeared to drip into a red pool on the floor where lay clustered a paint roller, pots and brushes.

Letizia and her regal husband are no strangers to events celebrating art and culture, they recently attended the inauguration of a a Picasso exhibition at the Museo de Belas Artes in A Coruna in the north west coastal region of Galicia. 

In seeming tribute to the legendary Spanish artist, Letizia even wore a Breton-striped top for the event. 

The pair also attended the Picasso Museum in Malaga on Spain's Costa del Sol, in September, before attending a formal dinner

Earlier this week Letizia attended a meeting with the board of the Royal Council on Disability.

One of Letizia's favoured causes, the mother-of-two appeared deep in concentration as she listened to the points raised by her fellow board members.
