Distressing footage has been released showing a horse thrashing around in a hotel lobby after it escaped from its owner.

The disorientated animal can be seen trying to get into a lift and turning round in circles after it went into the Best Western Maypole Hotel in Birmingham.

It appears to be having difficulty with staying upright on the slippery tiles of the hotel lobby where it knocked over plants and kicked dents in the walls.

Horseplay: The runaway nag was captured on CCTV after it found its way into Best Western's lobby

Guests who were staying at Best 
Western Maypole Hotel ran for cover when the horse, which had escaped 
from a nearby field, ran in through the 
glass sliding doors at the entrance to the hotel.

Moments
earlier, it had been seen bolting across the car park of a nearby 
store, dodging attempts along the way to lasso it with a tow rope.

The horse, which was limping and sweating, was finally snared when West Midlands Police arrived on the scene.

Officers brought the horse under control and returned it to its owner, but sadly the animal later had to be put down.

Heather Thornton, director of sales at the hotel, said: 'I saw two police officers when I arrived at 9.50am and there were a lot of people standing around the hotel looking bemused.

'The horse tried to get into the lift and then it reversed out again. It was stressed and frightened.

'It
did a lot of damage to the lobby. It made some dents in the wall and 
knocked over plants but the staff were worried about the horse.'

The horse had earlier run past a nearby Halfords store and escaped the clutches of duty manager Jay Gordhan.

The 36-year-old said: 'A customer walked in asking if anyone had seen a horse. Just then, it appeared and ran around the car park.

'I was worried about our customers and any kids who may have been walking so I grabbed one of our tow ropes and tried to throw it over the horse.

'But it ran into the Best Western and smashed up a bit of their lobby. I told one of the girls to throw it some fruit to keep it there.'

The horse then made its way to a Wilkinson hardware shop and a Sainsbury’s supermarket.

No place to hide: The cramped environs of the lift were too small for the distressed nag, which backs out

Mr Gordhan added: 'Wilkinson have a glass window and it must have been confused thinking it was another horse.

'It was stressed because it was out on the road and that’s why we were trying to keep it calm, poor thing. It was sweating, I felt sorry for it.'

A Best Western spokesman said the horse had come in through the hotel’s sliding glass front doors.

'Clearly scared it was trying to find its way back out. Staff and guests were very concerned about the horse and tried to make sure it did not injure itself,' he added.

'While some damage was done to the hotel, the horse eventually found its way out after trying to get in the lift, and wondered across the road to Sainsbury’s.

'Sadly the horse had to be put down. The hotel staff do not know why, but are devastated about the outcome.'
