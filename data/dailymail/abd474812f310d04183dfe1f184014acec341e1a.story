Stuart Lancaster's worst fears looked to be coming true on Saturday night as two more England stars emerged as Six Nations injury doubts.

Northampton flanker Tom Wood, a regular on England’s blindside of the scrum under Lancaster, hobbled off the field early in the second half of his side’s defeat by Racing Metro. And Leicester lock Geoff Parling also limped from the field in his side’s clash with Ulster.

Both men will be assessed today but with a raft of players already sidelined, Lancaster can ill afford to lose two key men ahead of his side’s clash with Wales on February 6.

‘Tom has twisted his ankle,’ said Saints boss Jim Mallinder said. ‘Hopefully it’s no more serious than that. He was certainly sore and it was the sensible thing to bring him off.’

Parling, who missed the autumn internationals with concussion, is in contention to start in England’s second row after Joe Launchbury (neck) and Courtney Lawes (ankle) both underwent surgery in recent weeks which has ruled them out of all, or most, of the Six Nations.

But he is now a doubt for the Millennium Stadium clash himself, with his uncapped Leicester team-mate Graham Kitchener increasingly likely to feature in some capacity in Cardiff.

First-choice No 8 Ben Morgan has been ruled out for at least six months after suffering a broken leg a fortnight ago, while there are serious concerns about Manu Tuilagi’s fitness after it emerged he is suffering a chronic groin condition.

Tuilagi is undergoing regular injections into his pubic bone in an attempt to cure the problem — believed to the notorious condition known as Gilmore’s groin — and admits he does not know when he will return.

There are also concerns over captain Chris Robshaw’s shoulder, which may yet need an operation before the World Cup.

England’s autumn series was blighted by injury and Lancaster has never been able to select from a fully fit team since taking over three years ago.
