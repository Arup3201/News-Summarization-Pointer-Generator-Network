The 16-year-old Nebraksa Catholic High School student wanted for a brutal hammer and knife attack on another female student was apprehended this morning over 200 miles away from her home after 24-hours on the run.

Sarah Piccolo was found alone on U.S. 75, suffering car trouble in Woodson County, Kansas, and was taken to a juvenile detention center where she was charged with First Degree Assault and Use of a Weapon to Commit a Felony for Monday's attack on 17-year-old Ellen Kopetsky.

Police in Kansas said that Piccolo will be transported back to Lincoln, Nebraska where authorities have decided she will be tried as an adult after the alleged disturbing attack on Kopetsky yesterday in the bathrooms of Pius X Catholic High School.

Kopetzky was hit two times in the head with a claw hammer and cut around her mouth and chin, and on her hands, Lincoln Police Officer Katie Flood said on Tuesday morning to The Beatrice Daily Sun.

Police said Piccolo had no relationship with Kopetzky, leaving friends and family to wonder how what the motive for the attack was.

In the affidavit for the arrest of Piccolo, Lincoln Police Officer Joseph Yinrick said that Kopetsky had spent the morning in the guidance counselor's office and then walked across the hall to the bathroom at about 9.45 a.m. on Monday morning.

Kopetsky said that when she walked in she was immediately attacked by a girl wielding a knife and what she thought was a large stick.

'The victim said her attacker was swinging wildly at her with the knife and stick and did not say a word to her,' said Kopetsky in the affidavit.

Police later found a hunting-style knife with an 8-inch serrated blade and a hammer in the bathroom, but Piccolo had fled the scene in a grey 1992 Buick Park Avenue with Nebraska plate number.

Kopetsky underwent surgery to her wounds yesterday but was allowed home from Bryan West hospital today.

'Our family is happy to report that our daughter Ellen has returned home to continue her recovery,' her parents said in a statement.

Kopetzky told police after the attack she didn't know her attacker's name but recognized her as a junior.Police said the staff member recognized her as Piccolo.

Yesterday in the immediate aftermath of the attack the school immediately went into lock-down following the shocking event and Piccolo fled the scene in a grey 1992 Buick Park Avenue with Nebraska plate number TJM 557.

Lincoln Police Captain David Beggs confirmed that a large survival knife was recovered from the bathroom along with a claw hammer.

Following the brutal attack, Pius X was locked down for over two hours while a dozen officers, some armed with assault rifles, made three sweeps of the campus to try and find Piccolo.

Lincoln Police Officer Katie Flood confirmed that Kopetzky was cut across the face and also was struck in the head with a hammer.

Emergency: The victim, Ellen Kopetsky was rushed to hospital after the attack this morning where she underwent surgery

Pius senior Jacob Miller, 17, said he is a friend of the Kopetzky. He told KOLN-TV she was a kind, wonderful classmate.

'I don’t know why anybody would be mad at her,' he said.

Police said that the school's 
surveillance cameras showed Piccolo exiting the school just after the 
assault and driving away in an eastward direction.

Several nearby schools, including East High, Lefler and Mickle middle 
schools and Eastridge, Pyrtle, Maxey, Morley and St. Joseph's elementary
 schools, went into lock-down because of the incident at Pius X.

The 
lock-downs were lifted around 1 p.m.

The
 Rev. Jim Meysenburg, school superintendent, said Piccolo does not have a
 history of disciplinary issues or are they aware of any issues between 
Piccolo and Kopetsky.

Piccolo’s grandmother, June, said her granddaughter has always been a sweet girl.

'I wouldn’t have even thought this possible, because she’s always a quiet girl,' she said to the Journal Star.
