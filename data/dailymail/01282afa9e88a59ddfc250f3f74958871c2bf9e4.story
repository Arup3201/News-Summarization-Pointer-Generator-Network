San Antonio police are looking for the crook who broke into a veteran's truck and took his iPod.

On Thursday, someone snatched Staff Sgt. Ben Eberle's iPod Touch - which includes an application that is specifically wired to let him use his prosthetic hand, San Antonio Express-News reported.

'[Getting a new prosthetic hand and iPod configured to work together] takes a long time,' Eberle told the newspaper. 'It's tedious and it's a lot of work with the hand itself.'

Veteran: U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Ben Eberle is seen in this 2011 file photo. Eberle lost his right hand and both of his legs because of a bomb explosion

Speaking about the robbery, Eberele also said 'I was pissed. I threw my blanket off and I wanted to just get up and run out the door, but I had to get my wheelchair.'

The Eberles told the newspaper that the thief unsuccessfully attempted to yank the soldier's stereo.

Three years ago, Eberle lost both his right hand and both of his legs in Afghanistan because of a bomb explosion, the newspaper reported. 

'They didn't know if I was going to make it,' he told San Antonio Express-News. 

Missing: Police said the missing iPod Touch would have a case not unlike this one

Hand: The San Antonio Police Department shared this photograph on Facebook of Eberle's prosthetic hand 

'I believe that we owe guys like this a lot more than this sort of treatment, as a society,' San Antonio Police Department spokesman Sgt. Javier Salazar told San Antonio Express-News. 'We would ask that whoever did this recognize the gravity of their crime and do the right thing.'

Eberle maintained in a Facebook post the Veterans Administration is able to cover a replacement hand and that he and his wife 'don't need help getting anything.'

'I can turn in my hand to the VA like I told them and do a 1 for 1 swap,' he wrote. 'I'm just pissed that someone smashed my window open, that's all. They just wanted another story about a wounded warrior.'

On Facebook, the police department wrote that 'Crimestoppers could pay up to $5000 for information.' Crimestoppers can be reached at (210) 224-STOP.
