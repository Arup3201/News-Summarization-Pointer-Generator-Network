Just hours after his ex-girlfriend declared her innocence in the murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher, Amanda Knox's former flame Raffaele Sollecito said that the Italian court's decision to reconvict them 'is completely unbelievable'.

Sollecito told the Today Show this morning that latest court decision that names the American and her Italian boyfriend as the killers of her British study abroad roommate 'is full of errors, there are mistakes all over the pages' and he is planning on appealing.

'They invented new evidence... they pictured it happening (and) it never happened. They invented more fiction,' he said in a remote interview from Treviso, Italy.

Defending his name: Raffaele Sollecito has denied the charges placed against him in the latest round of the court case surrounding his ex-girlfriend's roommates' 2007 murder

'I didn't know Meredith Kercher. I had no reason to hide an argument with Amanda or mere or anyone in this case.

He said that 'no clue or little piece of suspect- nothing at all' places him at the scene or could tie him to the victim's murder.

'My position is completely different than Amanda's case,' he said, though it came just hours after Knox made a similar statement, saying there is no hard evidence to show her as the killer.

'If I were (at the scene), I would have had traces of Meredith's broken body on me and I would have left traces of myself around Meredith's corpse and I'm not there and that proves my innocence,' she told CNN in an interview that aired Thursday night.

'It's only speculation that convicts us its evidence that acquits us.'

Victim: Knox was first convicted of killing British roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007. She was allowed to return to the United States four years later when that decision was overturned. But the case was brought up again this year

Unlike Amanda, however, Raffaele was in Italy and in court for the latest incarnation of the trial while Amanda stayed in Washington state for fear that she would be re-imprisoned if the court found them guilty- which they did.

'I came back to Italy because here I have my dreams my life my friends and I have nothing to hide,' he said Friday morning.

'There's nothing against me and nothing has ever been against me. I have really a clear conscious and there is no reason for me to accept or understand why I am free or to look at my back or my shadows for the rest of my life.

'It is completely unbelievable and it's out of reality. It is a fiction.'

Sollecito has vowed to appeal the latest decision, which finds them guilty of killing Kercher in 2007.

This round- the third of its kind after they were first found guilty, then innocent, and now guilty again- raised new questions and suggested a new possible motive in the case.

The formal ruling was handed down on Tuesday in a 337-page report, which finds that Knox stabbed Kercher to death in a fight over money.

According to the report, known as a 'motivation' of the sentence, Knox inflicted the fatal knife wound to Kercher, a student at Leeds University.

The document states: 'It is a matter of fact that at a certain point in the evening events accelerated; the English girl was attacked by Amanda Marie Knox, by Raffaele Sollecito, who was backing up his girlfriend, and by Rudy Hermann Guede, and constrained within her own room.'

Finding the faults: Speaking from Treviso, Italy, Sollecito said his lawyers are working through the 337-page decision which was handed down on Tuesday

Couple: Knox and Socellito served four years in prison before being acquitted and released. However, they were reconvicted by the Florence appeals court on January 30, and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively

It adds that it's difficult to establish a reason for the brutal slaying of Ms Kercher, but goes on to cite allegations of tension between Knox and the student.

It also refers to a statement that Guede made to police that Ms Kercher believed Knox stole 300 euros (£246) - and two credits cards - from her, which is described as a ‘valid motive’ for the murder.

Knox is dumbfounded by the court's conclusions, saying she saved up money to go to Italy and wasn't financially strained.

That's compared to Rudy Guede, who was separately convicted of Kercher's murder and testified in this latest case.

Knox says he was 'a known thief, a known burglar who did this on a regular basis to survive'.
