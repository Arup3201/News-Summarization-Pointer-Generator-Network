It opened in the West Midlands with a blaze of publicity, but within weeks it had been dubbed the art world's 'Pink Elephant'.

Now The Public, a £72million black and pink themed gallery in West Bromwich, is to close just five years after it opened.

The reason is clear - The Public simply couldn't attract the Great British public.

The Public in West Bromwich has been consigned to history after it was closed by Sandwell Council

As a result, Sandwell Council have had to pull the venue's annual £1.6million subsidy. Now the site will be transformed into a sixth form college.

Plans for the gallery had been hailed as one of Britain's largest and most ambitious 
cultural building projects, at the centrepiece of a £500million 
regeneration of the town.

But when it opened in 2008 there was a storm of controversy.

The project was more than £32million over budget, it opened three years late and in the weeks after it did open, it was beset by technical problems which prevented it from charging 
visitors.

Even the free concerts put on at the venue to bring people in attracted few visitors. One performance, by the soul singer Aisha, drew an audience of just 17 
people.

Originally planned to open in 2005, The Public had problems from the beginning. Six months into 
construction architect Will Alsop went into receivership.

The Public went way over budget and costs spiraled to £72million as it was built - then it was best by technical problems

New architects were appointed but in 2006 the project was put into administration when the budget spiraled.

After
18 months the administrators decided that the building should be 
finished and the project was transferred to the direct control of 
Sandwell Council.

On Saturday, the venue finally attracted a bumper crowd as thousands of people turned out to say goodbye to the 'Pink Elephant'.

Margaret Donnelly, a 46-year-old nurse from Smethwick, told the Express & Star: 'It is absolutely devastating. In my view The Public is one of the best things to have happened to West Bromwich.

'I have come to see a lot of events and shows and they have all been fantastic. It has also been a great place to bring children to learn new things.

'I think it a very sad day for the town.'

Rozie White, a 47-year-old artist from Gorsty Hill, Rowley Regis, said she had exhibited works at the venue and was 'gutted’ to see it go.

'The decision to close The Public now makes no sense. With the completion of New Square this is the time the venue is most needed. Instead it is being shut.

'I can’t help but think if a building like this had been in another area, such as Birmingham, it would have been saved but because it is in West Bromwich it isn’t.'

Sandwell Mayor Linda Horton said: 'I was here at the opening when many were very much against even the idea of an arts centre in Sandwell and branded it complete nonsense.

'Now we are here to celebrate its life and mourn its passing as many are now so very much for the idea of an arts centre in Sandwell.

'We have gone full circle in a very short time.'

Sandwell Council leader Darren Cooper said: 'I've been charged by the people of Sandwell to protect front-line services, and that is what I am trying to do.

'It's a difficult decision, I'm sorry that we're having to make this decision, and I do appreciate why some people are upset.'
