An assistant referee was yesterday struck by a firework thrown during a Premier League football match.

David Bryan, who was running the line in front of Tottenham Hotspur fans at Aston Villa, was hit by a flare or smoke bomb thrown after Andros Townsend opened the scoring for Spurs in the first half.

Hundreds of thousands of TV viewers watched on Sky Sports 1 as the blue firework was launched from a section of Spurs fans in the Doug Ellis Stand during the game at Villa Park in Birmingham.

Incident: Linesman David Bryan was hit by a firework hurled onto the pitch from the Tottenham Hotspur section

Hit: Mr Bryan reacts after being struck square in the back by the smoke bomb at Villa Park in Birmingham

Searching: Police and stewards look for the person who threw the smoke bomb onto the pitch during the game

The restart after the 31st-minute goal
was delayed after the incident yesterday afternoon at around 4.30pm but Mr Bryan, who 
appeared to have been hit on the back of the neck, was fit to continue.

A
fan was led out 
of the stadium by police and stewards soon after. The Football 
Association, which has issued warnings on flares this season, said the 
incident was 'unacceptable' and will investigate.

A
West Midlands Police spokesman said on Twitter last night: ‘Police have 
arrested two men after a lit flare was thrown on the pitch during the 
Villa v Spurs game - the flare hit a linesman.

‘The
two men aged 25 and 47 were arrested following the incident at Villa 
Park. Fortunately the linesman wasn't injured.’  Spurs won the game 2-0,
with Roberto Soldado scoring the second goal.

An FA spokesman said last night: 'The FA will investigate this matter, which is unacceptable.

'We
will await the match officials' report and will be speaking to the 
clubs. Such incidents highlight the dangers of pyrotechnics being used 
in a football stadium.'

TalkSport presenter Ian Abrahams said on 
Twitter: 'Smoke bombs and flares may be banned but idiots are still 
getting them into grounds, so stewards are not doing their job.'

Policing Minister Damian Green warned 
football fans in August that those who were smuggling flares into 
matches were putting other supporters’ lives at risk.

In
May, a 15-year-old boy suffered lung damage from a smoke bomb thrown 
during Villa's 2-2 draw at Wigan Athletic, while two women aged 22 and 
24 also required medical attention.

Three
months earlier a 14-year-old boy was killed by a flare thrown by fans 
during a South American Libertadores Cup match between San Jose and 
Corinthians in Orouro, Bolivia.
