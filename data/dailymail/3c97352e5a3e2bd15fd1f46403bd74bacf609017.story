A laptop started an apartment fire in Oregon on Wednesday after its battery ignited nearby bedding and clothing.

The house fire in Corvallis began around 10.30am in a shared student apartment in the city, according to the Corvallis Gazette Times.

Firefighters believe the battery of a 2008 MacBook Pro started the blaze after the battery fell out onto the floor of the ground-floor flat on Southwest 49th Street.

Laptop fire: A mattress and clothing caught fire in the blaze in Corvallis, Oregon, on Wednesday morning. Firefighters said it was caused by a Macbook Pro battery that fell out onto the bedding igniting the blaze

The incident has prompted the local fire chief to warn against leaving laptops near combustible surfaces when not in use and get batteries which overheat or don't hold a charge checked out immediately.

Thankfully a fire alarm was in place in the house shared by students at Oregon State University.

When it went off they discovered the smoldering clothes and mattress and immediately called 911, because of their quick reaction damage to the property was said to be 'minimal'.

Warning: Firefighters in Corvallis, Oregon, have warned residents to store laptops, like the 2008 Macbook Pro, pictured left, away from combustible surfaces following the Wednesday morning blaze at the shared home

Corvallis Fire Prevention Officer Jim Patton told the newspaper: 'Fire damage was minimal and limited to the small area of origin near the nightstand and bed.'

The owner of the laptop had left the computer so it was partially hanging over a wooden nightstand, according to the report.

It is believed the battery fell from there to the floor.

The American Red Cross said they would be help residents find temporary accommodation while the damage was assessed.

In March 2007 Apple offered to replace batteries on earlier Macbook models after defects were reported in their batteries including swelling and overheating.

However the company told Macnewsworld.com that the issues weren't a safety risk and a software update had solved the problem.

Apple were unable to comment today.
