This machete-wielding thug - shown in these pictures terrifying shoppers in a busy town centre - has been spared a prison sentence.

Also in possession of a hammer, Anthony Underwood, 27, vandalised a police station before storming through Bedford ‘completely without warning’.

He was caught on CCTV running through crowds of alarmed shoppers on the town’s high street on a busy afternoon on November 11.

Anthony Underwood has been spared a jail term despite storming through a busy town centre with a machete

Underwood, 27, who was also armed with a hammer, terrorised shoppers in Bedford in November

Police desperately chased him through the town and warned pedestrians to flee the area in order to avoid being targeted.

Officers eventually cornered Underwood before Sergeant Phil Boyd used a ‘flying rugby tackle’ to bring him under control.

He later confessed during his police interview that he was desperate to go to prison so he could kick his £300-a-day cocaine habit.

He has been ordered to carry out 120 hours of community service after appearing at Luton Crown Court

But Underwood walked out of court on 
Friday without a custodial sentence, despite admitting to criminal 
damage, affray and unlawful possession of a knife.

Judge Barbara Mensah instead handed him an eight-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, at Luton Crown Court.

She said: ‘Whatever your reasons, it would have been very frightening for members of the public who were there.

‘Sgt Boyd showed particular courage and deserves the commendation of the court.’

In addition to his suspended sentence Underwood, from Bedford, was also ordered to carry out 120 hours of community service.

He later confessed that he was desperate to go to prison so he could kick his £300-a-day cocaine habit
