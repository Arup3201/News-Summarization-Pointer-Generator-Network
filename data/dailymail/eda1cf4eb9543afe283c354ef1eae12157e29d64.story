A passenger plane carrying 65 passengers and crew came within seconds of crashing into a 285ft-tall bridge over the Mersey, it was reported yesterday.

Disaster was only prevented when an alarm went off in the cockpit of the Flybe flight to Liverpool from the Isle of Man after the pilot descended into a collision course with the Runcorn Bridge in Cheshire.

The drama was among a catalogue of safety scares including pilots being dazzled by lasers, passenger violence and mayday alerts involving planes leaving and landing at Liverpoolâ€™s John Lennon Airport in 2013.

The autopilot was disengaged when the co-pilot prepared to land the early-morning flight in June this year, according to the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report.

As he approached the road bridge, the planeâ€™s ground proximity warning system (EGPWS) sounded.

The report revealed that the plane was descending at a rate of 2,000 feet a minute and the alert was made at just 894ft.

The Runcorn Bridge stands 285ft tall over the River Mersey.

A bulletin by the AAIB, which investigates serious air incidents, said: 'Potential conflict with terrain or an obstacle results in the EGPWS providing a visual and audio caution or warning alert.

'The obstacle concerned in the case was not positively identified but was possibly the Runcorn Bridge.'

The plane was four miles from John Lennon Airport when the near-miss happened

The report adds that the flight crew took 'appropriate action' to correct the danger and made a safe landing.

Flybe has said while the safety of the flight was not compromised at any time, actions have since been taken to improve safety.

A spokesman said: 'Flybe confirms that safety of its passengers and crew is its number one priority.

In 2013, there were 128 reports of incidents at John Lennon Airport, including 45 laser pen attacks on flights to and from the airport.

Other incidents included:

'The event highlighted in the AAIB report was thoroughly investigated by our own investigators and through correspondence with the AAIB.

'Both parties concluded that at no time was the safety of the flight compromised; however, in light of the event, and despite the AAIB making no recommendations, Flybe has taken a number of actions to further improve safety.'

The incident was documented in reports which airlines are legally-bound to submit to the industry watchdog, the Civil Aviation Authority.

The CAA said the open culture of reporting incidents made flying in the UK 'extremely safe'.

A CAA spokesman said: 'The UK has an excellent aviation safety record. In terms of large commercially operated aeroplanes, the UK fatal accident rate is half that of the rest of the world combined.

'Because there is a legal obligation on airlines to report all safety incidents to us, no matter how seemingly trivial, we are able to share that information with other airlines to learn lessons.'

A JLA spokesman said: 'The report from the CAA relating to Liverpool John Lennon Airport needs to be put into context as it will include all manner of incidents, many far less serious than others, as well as including incidents occurring away from the airport.'
