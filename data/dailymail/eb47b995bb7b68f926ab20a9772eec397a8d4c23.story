Dynamo fans were left unimpressed last week when the magician appeared to float above the Shard, but wires could be seen from below.

However the 31-year-old, whose real name is Steven Frayne, has now claimed that he was just practising the levitation stunt above the London landmark - and the hard wires were for health and safety.

Dynamo had claimed to be floating 1,016ft above the capital’s streets last Wednesday, even tweeting a picture of the clouds along with a message 'the view is great up here #lookup'.

 of the Shard in London (left), however Twitter users quickly 
complained that they could see wires in the shots (right)

But social media users blasted him 
after the stunt, saying that the wires could be seen. One billed the 
trick a ‘fail’, while another labelled him a ‘cheat’.

However,
 Dynamo claimed today that the stunt was only a practice, telling The 
Sun: ‘That was a rehearsal and we used those wires for health and 
safety.

‘It's a shame a 
picture went out, but that's the world we live in. The stunt we filmed 
for the show will give people something to think about when they see the
 full effect.’

The magician -
 who shot to stardom thanks to his hit TV show Dynamo: Magician 
Impossible - filmed the stunt as part of the next series of the show, 
which Watch has confirmed will be the last.

And
 he was unconcerned by people ridiculing him online, adding: ‘I loved 
it. I do think people thought they'd caught me out and I'd be at home 
crying about it.

‘I was 
watching it all on Twitter and laughing. This is my hobby and everyone 
is so wound up about it. Magic makes people ask questions and that's all
 that was going on.’

During the stunt Dynamo, whose real name is 
Steven Frayne, found time to tweet a picture of the clouds as he hovered
 1,016ft above the streets below

Among the social media users criticising him last week was Kimberley Barrett who said: ‘Dynamo “levitating” on the shard, who saw the 
wires holding him? Fail'

While at the top of the Shard, Dynamo tweeted this message to his followers

Claire
 Broad said: 'This is meant to be Dynamo levitating above the Shard. Can
 anyone else see the wire? Cheat'. And David Manning added: 'If you look
 closely what it actually shows is Dynamo hanging by a wire.'

Last
 week, Dynamo said: 'I’ve been working with Variety, the children’s 
charity, and I invited some of the children they support to meet me at 
The View from the Shard as it is one of the best places to see London.

'After I finished meeting them, I decided to explore a bit further.'

Last
 year Dynamo caught media attention while filming a Pepsi advert in 
which he levitated past the Houses of Parliament while resting his hand 
on the top of a red double-decker bus.

The
 stunt saw him hanging in mid-air with his other arm stretched out as he
 crossed Westminster Bridge. A police escort cleared the way for the 
daring feat, ensuring there was no traffic around the bus.

The magician has built his name on the celebrity circuit, astounding famous names with his tricks.

He
 has levitated Lindsay Lohan, James Corden and Matt Lucas and performed 
card tricks for stars including Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Gwyneth Paltrow and 
Will Smith.

He once even forced Prince Charles to cover his face in alarm as the illusionist appeared to dislocate his little finger.

Other
 impressive tricks have included turning Austrian snow into diamonds, 
bringing cardboard butterflies to life and even transforming lottery 
tickets into banknotes on live television.

In
 2011, Dynamo made waves, almost literally, by 'walking' across the 
River Thames in an impressive stunt to launch his new TV series

The
 Bradford-born illusionist made it half-way across the stretch of the 
river in front of the Houses of Parliament in London before he was 
picked up by what appeared to be a River Police boat.

For
 the second series of his award-winning Dynamo: Magician Impossible, he 
shocked onlookers by appearing to dive from the roof of the LA Times 
headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles, only for his fall to stop when his
 body reached a horizontal position.

He
 then proceeded to calmly walk down the side of the building all the way
 to the pavement, which he then hopped on to before wandering off.

In
 2012, Dynamo was awarded the magic world's highest honour - Associate 
Membership of the secret inner sanctum of the Magic Circle.

In
 the same year, he won £10,000 by predicting exactly how Spain would win
 Euro 2012 from the quarter finals onwards. He was due to donate the 
winnings to The Teenage Cancer Trust.

The illusionist started performing magic after his great-grandfather suggested he used it to escape being bullied.

Thanks
 to severe Crohn's disease, a  dietary illness which affects the 
digestive system, Mr Frayne - who to this day measures 5ft 6in and 
weighs just 8st - was small, thin and an easy target for bullies.

He was advised by his great-grandfather to learn magic tricks as a way to protect himself.

‘He
 showed me a technique to make myself too heavy to lift,’ he once 
recalled. ‘The next time the bullies tried to pick me up, they couldn’t.
 They gave up and ran away.

‘I never had any trouble again. Word got round the school that I had super-powers, so I got a lot of respect.’

His interest in magic developed, and he took to earning money performing tricks in local bars and clubs.

At
 the age of 17, as word of his talent spread, Dynamo was invited to 
perform at a US conference to mark the anniversary of the death of Harry
 Houdini.

His show, Dynamo: Magician Impossible, draws 30million viewers in the UK but channel Watch TV has confirmed that the next series will be the last

It was here that he was provided with his nickname after an audience member shouted: ‘The kid's a Dynamo!'

After leaving college, the teenager received a £60,000 grant from the Prince’s Trust to make a demo DVD of his ‘street’ magic.

Impressed
 by the video, executives at satellite channel Watch commissioned the 
first series of his TV show, which has since received much critical 
acclaim, becoming the first digital programme to win Best Entertainment 
Programme two years running at the Broadcast Awards.

Dynamo:
 Magician Impossible also won TV Show of The Year as voted by viewers at
 the Virgin Media Awards and Best Multichannel Programme at the 2013 
Broadcasting Press Guild Awards.

It has been nominated for Baftas and a National Television Award.

Dynamo’s
 worldwide social following has continued to grow and he now has 
2.2million Twitter followers and 4.4million Facebook fans. That makes 
him the most followed magician in the world.

WALKING ACROSS THE RIVER THAMES

On a summer's evening in 2011, Dynamo caused quite a stir with an impressive stunt to launch his new TV series.

After casually making his way through a gate by the side of Westminster Bridge, the magician stunned onlookers by gingerly stepping on to the River Thames.

Crowds gathered on the banks of the river as the illusionist made it halfway across the water in front of the Houses of Parliament before he was picked up by what appeared to be a River Police Boat.

LEVITATING COMEDIAN MATT LUCAS

In 2009, with his profile as a magician rising across the country, Dynamo appeared to make comedian Matt Lucas float.

The stunt was carried out at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium to publicise a charity fundraiser.

The trick has been a favourite of the magician over the years.

He has performed similar tricks in a number of his episodes on his TV show, including on Lindsay Lohan.

WALKING DOWN A SKYSCRAPER

Always with an eye for drama, for the second series of his award-winning TV show Dynamo shocked onlookers after appearing on the roof of the LA Times headquarters in Los Angeles.

To the gasps of those down below the magician appeared to dive from the roof, only for his fall to stop when his body reached a horizontal position.

He then proceeded to calmly walk down the side of the building before hopping off once he reached the pavement.

He then quite happily wandered off into the night.

WALKING THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW

With footballer Rio Ferdinand and a number of soap stars in attendance, it was at a glitzy celebrity party in Central London that Dynamo appeared to walk through a pane of glass.

The magician handed his jacked to two bouncers who then held it up to create a shoulder-high screen.

He then disappeared behind the screen before re-emerging on the pavement on the other side of the shop window, as if he had made his way through the glass, much to the bemusement of the onlookers.

PREDICTING HOW SPAIN WOULD WIN EURO 2012

Appearing on This Morning in the summer of 2012, Dynamo showed presenters Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield how he had won £10,000 by predicting exactly how Spain would win Euro 2012 from the quarter finals onwards.

Holding up a betting slip as proof of the 10,000-1 gambit the illusionist had even forecast how Spain would win by two or more goals against their Italian rivals.

The magician told how he made a £1 accumulator bet just before the quarter-finals on June 21.

He then left the Paddy Power slip with the production team at ITV, returning two weeks later to appear on the popular TV show.

At the time it was reported the magician was to donate his winnings to The Teenage Cancer Trust.
