Liverpool legend Steve Nicol has led the chorus of disapproval in the United States after Frank Lampard delayed his move to New York City to remain with Manchester City. 

Nicol, who was the coach of fellow MLS side New England Revolution until 2011,  told ESPN: 'It is a disaster for that new franchise, a disaster for the MLS.'

On Wednesday night, it was confirmed that Lampard would remain in Manchester until the end of the season after City and their sister club in New York thrashed out a deal - which was then approved by the Premier League board. He is eligible to face Sunderland on New Year's Day.

Lampard has spent the first half of the season on a short-term deal at City after signing a pre-contract agreement with sister outfit New York  that was due to commence on January 1.

He remains a contracted Manchester City player and is not at this moment associated with the New York side.

In the States, it appears to have been viewed as a blow to the credibility of the American enterprise as the needs of Manchester appear to have been placed above the growth of New York City. 

Lampard was unveiled as one of their signature marquee signings last summer but he may now not arrive until several months into the MLS campaign.

It has provoked a furious reaction from a New York City independent supporters' group, The Third Rail, who have released the following statement: 'On behalf of the Third Rail, we would like to publicly denounce City Football Group’s and Frank Lampard’s decision to extend his loan to Manchester City until the end of the Premier League season. 

'Many fans, including our members, decided to support the team, committed to season tickets, and bought merchandise under the impression that Frank Lampard would be playing for New York City Football Club, not Manchester City. 

'Many of those fans are rightly outraged by this decision, and we support any course of action they take to voice their discontent over this decision.

'Our support for our ownership group has been unwavering until now, but this we cannot support. We reject out of hand any suggestion that NYCFC is in any way secondary to Manchester City FC, regardless of the source, and are disappointed that City Football Group would give such an appearance.'

His exact starting date in New York remains to be decided. On Wednesday evening, City sources were not ruling out the possibility that Lampard could yet return to New York for the beginning of the MLS season in March or later on in Manchester City's season.

For that to happen, the two clubs would have to agree a loan deal from Manchester City or a permanent transfer.

It appears to be a possibility that remains open for discussion, although it seems most likely that Lampard will remain in Manchester as long as Manuel Pellegrini believes he has a role to play at the club. A New York City statement said: 'His exact starting date with New York City FC will be confirmed as the EPL and MLS seasons unfold. All parties remain in continuing dialogue to create the best outcome for all.

The Third Rail, who claim to be the first independent supporters group for New York City FC, reacted furiously to the news on Friday.

On behalf of the Third Rail, we would like to publicly denounce City Football Group’s and Frank Lampard’s decision to extend his loan to Manchester City until the end of the Premier League season.

Many fans, including our members, decided to support the team, committed to season tickets, and bought merchandise under the impression that Frank Lampard would be playing for New York City Football Club, not Manchester City. Many of those fans are rightly outraged by this decision, and we support any course of action they take to voice their discontent over this decision.

Our support for our ownership group has been unwavering until now, but this we cannot support. We reject out of hand any suggestion that NYCFC is in any way secondary to Manchester City FC, regardless of the source, and are disappointed that City Football Group would give such an appearance.

The Third Rail will forever act as a voice for the fans of New York City Football Club.
