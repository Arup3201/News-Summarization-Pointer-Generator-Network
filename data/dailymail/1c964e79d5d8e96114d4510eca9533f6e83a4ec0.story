Nelson Mandela was last night discharged from hospital after a stay of almost three weeks.

The 94-year-old former president was admitted 19 days ago in the South African capital, Pretoria, and treated for a lung infection and gallstones.

There had been increasing concern about his health after he had remained in hospital over Christmas.

Mr Mandela was visited on Christmas Day by South African president Jacob Zuma who claimed he was ‘looking better’.

He will continue to receive treatment at home in Johannesburg, a statement broadcast on South African television said.

The anti-apartheid leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate has a history of lung problems dating back to when he contracted tuberculosis during his 27 years as a political prisoner. This was his longest stay in hospital since he was freed from jail in 1990.

Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj 
requested that the public respect 
Mandela's privacy at this time.

Zuma said in a statement yesterday that doctors were happy with the progress the anti-apartheid hero was making.

'We
found him in good spirits. He was happy to have visitors on this 
special day and is looking much better. The doctors are happy with the 
progress that he is making,' said Zuma.

The 94-year-old Nobel Peace laureate was airlifted from his rural village in the south of the country to the hospital for a series of tests.
