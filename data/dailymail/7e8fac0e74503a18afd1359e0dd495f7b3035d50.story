A pie and mash shop in East London which has fed thousands of hungry cockneys and even survived a World War has been awarded Grade II listed status by Heritage England.

Described as 'a unique part of the capital’s history', L. Manze Eel, Pie and Mash Shop on Walthamstow High Street was hailed as a 'unique part of the capital's history' by the conservation charity.

The building, which was first opened to the public in 1929, has been given the accolade for its 'beautifully preserved interiors', which have never been replaced or modernised.

Historic: L. Manze, which first opened its doors in 1929, has been described as a 'unique part of the capital's heritage' by Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey

Tradition: Pie and mash shops became a hit in Victorian times thanks to the simplicity of the dish, which meant it could be produced cheaply on site and served that day

Opened by Luigi Manze, the acclaimed pie shop was designed by architect Herbert Wright who introduced the traditional gilt lettering, marble counters, white-tiled decor and mirrors which remain to this day. 

The Manze family ran the east London eatery until 1970 before it came into the hands of Current owner Jacqueline Cooper.

She said: 'It’s really a gem of Walthamstow and I’m just delighted because the shop is so beautiful'.

Roger Bowdler, designation director 
for English Heritage, said: 'This 1920s example, with it beautifully 
preserved interior, is among the best of an increasingly rare kind, and 
strongly deserves to be listed.'

Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey also backed the award, saying: 'Pie and mash shops are as intrinsically linked to London as black cabs and Beefeaters.

'L. Manze’s in Walthamstow is a unique 
part of the capital’s heritage and is as relevant and popular now as it 
was when it first opened in the 1920s.'

Good, honest food: Pie and mash was popular among the working classes of East London, who lived close to the Thames were eels could be sourced cheaply

Familiar: The traditional white tiles and marble surfaces of pie and mash shops are thought to have become standard because they are easy to clean down

Mrs Cooper believes the award has come at the right time for Pie and Mash shops, which she said are enjoying a renaissance thanks to the backing of London-born celebrities such as David Beckham.

She said: 'We get all different walks of life coming in. I think it’s becoming a little trendier now - especially with everyone knowing David Beckham eats it.'

The popular pie and mash of today is 
much different to the dish which was first served up to poor Londoners 
in the East of the city during Victorian times.

It was a hit with locals because it was both cheap to make and hearty to eat.

The eels came at a low cost to producers 
because they were easy to source from the nearby Thames. They were one 
of the few fish which could survive the polluted waters of the river, 
making them a staple for Londoners of the time.

Original recipe: Although pie and Mash shops have modernised, early incarnations of the meal were served with eel pies, potato and parsley liquor

Serving suggestion: Staff at L Manze, above, stick to the recommended technique for plating up pie and mash by administering 'liberal amounts' of liquor

The addition of some cheap mashed potato and a home made 'liquor', which came in the form of a green parsley gravy saw pie and mash become a sit down meal for hungry families.

It's simplicity meant that shops could mass produce the hearty meal and serve scores of customers a day with fresh produce.

After the second World War, eel supplies in the Thames began to dwindle causing their price to soar.

This saw the growth in popularity of meat pies filled with cheap mutton or mince. Both variations are still served today.

Classic: The simple plate remains a cheap and hearty meal for Brits, with pie and mash shops now popular destinations for tourists
