Las Vegas police have released a shocking surveillance video showing the final moments of Jerad and Amanda Miller as they made their last stand in a Walmart after slaughtering two police officers and a civilian.

The video appears to show the couple pointing pistols at each other before Amanda fires a shot at her husband. Jerad Miller collapses and dies, then Amanda turns the handgun on herself.

Despite appearances in the video, Las Vegas police said Wednesday that it was actually police officers who killed Jerad.

Police say an autopsy has revealed Jerad, 31, was killed by a .223-caliber rifle round - not a handgun - moments before Amanda, 22, shot her husband. Three officers fired their weapons at him after following the couple into the store.

Authorities also revealed that they had contact with Jerad and Amanda Miller three times since they moved to Las Vegas earlier this year - including once just days before their rampage.

Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill said officers had no reason to believe Jerad was planning a mass shooting in any of the instances. He appeared calm and did not espouse the white supremacist and anti-government views for which he has since become infamous, the Las Vegas Journal-Review reports.

The Millers slaughtered two Las Vegas police officers, Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31, as they ate lunch Sunday afternoon - shooting both a close range.

They then ran into a nearby Walmart, where Jerad fired a shot into the ceiling and declared 'this is the revolution' and demanded everyone leave.

Joseph Robert Wilcox, 31, a shopper who was carrying a concealed weapon, tried to sneak up on Jerad. However, as he did, he passed by Amanda, not realizing the two were together. 

Amanda shot Wilcox at close range, killing him.

Police footage recently released shows the Millers taking cover in the Walmart where their last stand took place.

Bradbury claims that he was affiliated with the same group as Jerad and Amanda Miller, the '765 Anarchists'

The couple then fled to a back corner of the store, where they prepared to make their last stand as officers armed with assault rifles closed in.

The Walmart surveillance video shows both laying on the ground, pointing handguns at each other.

Amanda appears to fire her weapon at her husband, a moment later he goes limp.

The 22-year-old Indiana woman then turns the gun on herself. The video cuts out a moment before she fires the pistol into her own head.

Police originally reported that Amanda had killed her husband, however, autopsy results and further investigation revealed it was police officers who fired the fatal shot. All three officers who shot at Jerad Miller are on paid leave, as per the department policy on firing a weapon on duty.

The Millers frequently dressed as comic book villains from Batman. Jerad especially loved the anarchist Joker

Police also revealed that they had interactions with the Millers on three occasions.

In February, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles called Las Vegas police and asked them to investigate threats Jerad Miller had made against the office. When reached at his apartment, Miller claim he never threatened anyone and said his comment was that 'that's how people get shot.'

'The interaction was normal; there were no anti-government or anti-police” statements. They did not feel through the interview that the suspects were a potential threat,' McMahill said at a press conference Thursday.

Police also visited in April and took a witness statement from the Millers in relation to a domestic violence report filed by their neighbors.

Finally, on May 31, the Millers gave a witness statement for a sexual assault that occurred in their apartment complex.

Jerad Miller, in particular, was an avowed neo-Nazi who frequently spouted conspiracy theories about the world. After he and his wife murdered the officers, he draped their bodies with a Gadsden flag, the yellow symbol of the Tea Party, and a swastika.
