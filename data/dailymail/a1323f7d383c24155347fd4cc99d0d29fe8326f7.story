Gibraltar's chief minister has asked Britain to send Royal Navy warships to the area in a bid to stop Spanish boat police making unauthorised incursions into the Rock's territorial waters

Fabian Picardo an Oxford-educated lawyer and
leader of the Gibraltar Labour Party, has now asked David Cameron to send
vessels 'larger than the small craft it has now.'

He accused Madrid of 'sabre-rattling' and behaving like North Korea after Spanish foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo's suggested introducing a levy on people crossing the border between Gibraltar and Spain.

Plea: Gibraltar's chief minister has asked 
Britain to send Royal Navy warships as tensions mount following the creation of an artificial reef in a small bay around the Gibraltar airport runway (file pictures)

He told the Times: 'One of the issues that has been relevant has been that Spain has been making incursions with Guardia Civil launches into Gibraltar waters.

'With more naval assets it would be easier to show that these are British waters.'

He added: 'It's about asserting British sovereignty in a peaceful way and demonstrating that the waters are British by filling them with British assets.'

The latest row began after Mr Picardo 
ordered the dumping of 70 concrete blocks into a small bay around the 
Gibraltar airport runway in order to prevent Spanish overfishing of the area.

Spain hit back by introducing time-consuming security checks at the
border post leading to huge queues and long delays for people travelling
from Gibraltar into Spain.

Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo urged the government to 'demonstrate the waters are British by filling them with British assets.'

Yesterday
Mr Picardo said 'hell will freeze over' before Gibraltar remove the 
concrete which Madrid has claimed is harming Spanish fishermen adding 
that any border costs would violate European Union freedom of movement 
rules.

Spain is also considering closing its airspace to flights heading to the Rock which Mr Picardo claimed would be a dangerous move saying it was the 'politics of madness'.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted the UK will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Gibraltar's people and  urged Spain to avoid increasing tensions further.

Mr Hague added a political solution is needed to ease the current issues with Spain, while David Cameron's spokesman said the Prime Minister was 'seriously concerned'.

Talk surfaced from Madrid  the British Mediterranean outpost through its border with Spain.

Mr Garcia-Margallo suggested a proposed 50 euro (£43.30) fee imposed on every vehicle entering or leaving Gibraltar through Spain could be used to help Spanish fishermen who have lost out because of damage to fishing grounds.

Mr Picardo told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme yesterday: 'The things that Mr Garcia-Margallo has said are more reminiscent of the type of statement you'd hear from North Korea than from an EU partner.

'We've seen it before during Franco's time during the 1960s but I think all of us hoped that those politics were never going to come back and that the much more enlightened politics of Mr Moratinos (Miguel Angel Moratinos), who was the previous but one foreign minister of Spain, would prevail, which talked about people working together and creating economic benefits for the citizens on both sides of the frontier rather than the belligerence we are seeing now.'

European Commission (EC) spokesman Frederic Vincent confirmed controls on the Spain-Gibraltar border are allowed because the latter is not included in the Schengen Borders Agreement, which permits people to travel freely within the Schengen area of 26 countries.

Mr Vincent said that these controls or sanctions must be 'proportionate'.

He said the EC is studying the legality of Madrid's threat to impose a fee to cross the border between the two countries. The matter will be discussed at a future EC meeting, the spokesman said.

Mr Cameron's spokesman said the potential levy by Spain had not been raised directly with the British Government.

At a regular briefing for journalists in Westminster the Prime Minister's spokesman said: "Clearly, we remain seriously concerned by the events at the Spain/Gibraltar border.

'Specifically on this issue of border fees, the Spanish have not raised the prospect of introducing border fees with us. We are seeking an explanation from them regarding reports that they might target Gibraltar with further measures.'

The Government is in 'close contact' with the Spanish about the issue, but the spokesman refused to give further details about what the next steps might be.

The Prime Minister last spoke to his counterpart, Mariano Rajoy, about the issue at a European Council in June, before the latest developments.

A Foreign Office source said officials were attempting to establish whether Mr Garcia-Margallo's proposals were genuinely being considered by the Madrid government or if they were a "little bit of hot comment".

The Foreign Office has made clear that the UK expects Madrid to live up to the commitments it made in the 2006 Cordoba Agreement, which included deals on issues like border crossings and access for flights, as well as establishing a tripartite forum for regular dialogue between Britain, Spain and Gibraltar.

Mr Garcia-Margallo's comments represent the latest moves in the dispute over the status of Gibraltar, following a number of alleged Spanish incursions into the territory's waters.

Spain claims sovereignty over the Rock, which stands on the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula but has been a British Overseas Territory since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

The UK Government has made clear that it will not negotiate over sovereignty as long as Gibraltar's people want to remain British.

Spain's ambassador to the UK was summoned to the Foreign Office last week for a dressing down and to demand assurances that there would be no repeat of the excessive checks at the border which have caused lengthy delays.

Shadow foreign office minister Kerry McCarthy described Spain's proposal to impose a border fee as "unacceptable" and said the Foreign Office should strongly reject it.

And Sir Graham Watson, a Liberal Democrat MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar, said he had written to Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the EU Commission, about Mr Garcia-Margallo's comments.

Sir Graham said: "I am deeply concerned by Sr Margallo's latest comments, which follow months of harassment of my constituents by the Spanish government.

'The people of Gibraltar are as much EU citizens as those of Spain. As such, they have the clear legal right not to be discriminated against on the basis of where they are from; nor should their freedom of movement be restricted.'

He added: 'I have asked the Commission to send observers to monitor the situation at the frontier.'
