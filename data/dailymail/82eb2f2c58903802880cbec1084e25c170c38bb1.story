She's a mother of three who has proved that being busy is no excuse for getting fit.

Sally Brouwer, of Brisbane, transformed her post-pregnancy body after shedding 17kg by making time to exercise an hour each day - most of which she was able to do in the comfort of her own home.

And she isn't shy about her achievements.

So much so, she's posted various comparison photos of her pregnant self and her transformation which has caused a stir on social media.

The personal trainer and police officer says she always makes time to fit in exercise six days a week

Ms Brouwer says she considers her exercise sessions as 'time out for myself'

Ms Brouwer juggles her roles as a mother, police officer, a personal trainer and as the board director of Blue Sky Foundation for autistic children.

So she knows what it's like to lead a busy lifestyle. Nonetheless she makes time to fit in a hour of exercise six days a week.

'It's not a strict fitness regime, it's time out for myself for an hour a day,' Ms Brouwer told Daily Mail Australia.

'I love the feeling of challenging myself, enjoying the company of adults with similar interests to mine, being able to relieve the stress of a busy lifestyle and feel good about myself.'

Her daily fitness regime includes two sessions of one hour running intervals, teaching two classes of yoga and pilates and four high intensity interval training sessions each week.

'Most of these are with no equipment and can be done at home,' she said.

'I was training a lot more before children as I was racing triathlons and teaching a lot more fitness classes. These days I've cut my volume of training down but increased the intensity. I'd say in some areas I'm fitter and in others I'm not.'

Ms Brouwer has even turned banal daily chores into a form of exercise, such as the sock folding and dishwasher workouts.

Ms Brouwer, who lost the 17kg she gained during pregnancy, says she does most of her exercise at home

Ms Brouwer's tip to other mothers who want to get fit: 'Get up earlier. Get off social media. Turn off the TV. Get into a routine'

But her weight loss and also been met with criticism, especially when she shared a before and after shot of herself on Facebook.

Some thought her results were 'too extreme, skinny, gross and manlike'.

Ms Brouwer wasn't fazed. 

'I think it's quite funny that people get all upset about a photo of me,' she said.

'It's not my problem that other people in the world don't like what they see. I'm happy, my husband is happy, my world still turns regardless of what others think I should look like.'

1. Include the kids into their training - I've got heaps of videos on my FB page showing ideas to incorporate the kids.

2. Make everyday chores into fitness sessions such as sit-ups while your folding the socks, putting the washing basket inside and running back and forth to the washing line to hang out clothes, turning up the music and dancing while you're cooking dinner.

3. Get up earlier. Get off social media. Turn off the TV. Get into a routine.

4. Find other groups of mums who are interested in exercising too and meet at a local park. Take it in turns who's going to babysit the kids while the others exercise (or alternatively use the babysitting point as a rest station and swap throughout the workout).

5. Join the Sally Brouwer Fitness challenge  and I'll show you how you can get a great workout at home in just 15 minutes a day.
