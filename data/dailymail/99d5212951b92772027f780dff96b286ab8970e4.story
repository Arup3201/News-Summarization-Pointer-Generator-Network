It's often hard for chefs to showcase weird and wonderful flavours without putting off potential customers.

But one South Australian pub is taking bizarre flavour combinations to the next level - holding a beer festival where punters can sample brews made with squid, anchovies, chocolate, wasabi and even the droppings of a nocturnal mammal called the civet.

Commencing Thursday, eccentric brewers from across the globe are converging on Adelaide's Wheatsheaf Hotel for the Good Beer Wheaty - and they'll be sharing some of their wacky ways with beer aficionados.

Not your average brew: Weird and wacky flavours of beer will be showcased at Adelaide's Good Beer Wheaty this week.

The concept came about in 2011, when Wheatsheef Hotel co-publican Jade Flavell met up with New Zealand craft brewers Stu McKinlay and Sam Posseniskie, also known as the Yeastie Boys, at Melbourne's Good Beer Week.

Deciding to bring the concept to Adelaide, the pub and brewers launched Good Beer Wheaty the following year in 2012.

The Yeastie Boys won't be the only international beer makers at the festival, with brewers from England's Magic Rock, Italy's Birra Del Borgo, Denmark's To Ã˜l and Brookyln's Sixpoint craft breweries also featuring on the festival's lineup.

Attendees can taste exotic beers, featuring unexpected flavours, at one of five daily tasting sessions.

Some of the beers to be showcased at the sessions include a gin and tonic flavoured beer, in addition to the odd-sounding seafood, chocolate and wasabi flavours.

In addition to tastings, workshops will also be held for festival ticketholders.

Just like the odd brews being showcased, the classes promise not to be your average class.

Workshops include 'The Art of Spooning,' a celebration of the strange things that happen when weird brewers collaborate.

Another workshop called 'Skunkhour,' will teach attendees about the science behind beer flavouring.

'If Good Beer Wheaty Yeastie could be encapsulated in one word, it would have to be spooning,' Wheatsheef Hotel co-publican Jade Flavell said.

The festival runs from Thursday 15 May until Monday 19 May.
