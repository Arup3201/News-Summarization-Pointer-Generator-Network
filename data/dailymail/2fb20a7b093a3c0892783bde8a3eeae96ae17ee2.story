Jailed: Former Scout leader Ian Pain, who raped a child and shared indecent images of children with other paedophiles has been jailed for 16 years

A Scout leader who raped a 10-year-old and had thousands of child porn images stored on his computer has been jailed for 16 years.

Ian Pain, 48, had initially thanked police for arresting him in June last year after they found more than 3,800 photographs of children aged between seven and 16 being sexually abused on his computer.

He claimed that he 'hadn't hurt anybody' and that police action would prevent his urge to look at images of underage porn.

But six months later, a 10-year-old boy told one of his friends that he had been abused by Pain, who also refereed youth football matches, over a two year period.

He was jailed at Wolverhampton Crown Court this week after admitting his crimes which included inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, distributing indecent images of children and possessing indecent images of children.

Pain will also have to sign the sex offenders' register for life and is banned from ever working with, living with or communicating with children again.

The court heard that computers, mobile phones and other items were seized during a police raid on Pain's home in Wolverhampton - where he still lived with his parents.

Detectives found Pain had 68 level five images, the most extreme in an international evidential scale used by police.

Officers also found that 1,305 photographs and films had also been distributed via chat rooms and file sharing websites regularly used by paedophiles.

Pain was suspended from his leader's role at the Scouts, refereeing junior football matches and serving as an outwards bounds instructor as the investigation continued.

Following Pain's sentencing, Detective Constable Allan Sharp, from West Midlands Police, said: 'When questioned Pain described the dark and sickening online world in which he operated.

'He said that people like him who were viewing indecent images of children were encouraged to share photographs and films depicting abuse.

'If not, they would be removed from "friend lists" and eventually kicked out of the virtual group.

'Many of the sites he used were originally set up to allow people to share music and film. Over the years many of these have been hijacked by people like Pain.

'The crimes his victim described were truly horrendous. One can only imagine the immense burden the child had to bear alone and how that has negatively affected him.

'Up until the last minute, Ian Pain had denied abusing any child. It was only when he realised the consequences of maintaining his web of lies that he finally entered a guilty plea.

'I am satisfied with the lengthy sentence handed down by the courts.

'It reflects the seriousness of his offending and flies in the face of those people like Pain who believe that they are not harming children who feature in these images.

'To capture these acts real children have been subject to sickening abuse and emotionally damaged.'

Andy Barker, from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), added: 'The sentence of Ian Pain to 16 years imprisonment for this horrendous crime also highlights the risk posed to children by those who view indecent images of children.

'We know there are links between viewing such images and the contact abuse of children, which is why we continue to work alongside our police and industry colleagues to provide an increasingly hostile online environment for those who seek out child abuse images.'
