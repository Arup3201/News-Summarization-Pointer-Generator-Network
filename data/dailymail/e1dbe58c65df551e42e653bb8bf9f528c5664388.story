Who should be England's next captain?

To appreciate what playing for England meant to Steven Gerrard, let us to take you back to early November 2012 and the place where it all began for him.

Ahead of his landmark 100th appearance against Sweden, Gerrard had agreed to pose for a photograph for Sportsmail with pupils from his first school, Huyton with Roby, wearing his 99 caps. The idea was to re-create the famous image Kent Gavin has taken of Bobby Moore, with Gerrard sitting in amongst the children, cap-less, wearing a gleaming white England shirt.

The children who had been chosen to appear on the photograph were in position on the schoolyard, eagerly awaiting his arrival, when the time for Gerrard to make his entrance came.

Just as he was about to head out, though, he stopped in the Assembly Hall and began looking around, memories of his childhood clearly flooding back. It was in that moment the enormity of everything he had achieved - from the young lad who had dared to dream to the man who became England captain - appeared to hit him.

He loved being involved in the project and the shirt he wore for the picture now currently hangs in a frame in that assembly hall, a permanent reminder to those who sit in the same classrooms about what can be achieved with hard work, determination and dedication.

That is why there are no empty words when Gerrard says his decision to call time on playing for England career was ‘one of the hardest decisions’ he has ever made; he will have consulted many family and friends, most notably his wife, Alex, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, England head coach Roy Hodgson and his trusted long-term agent Struan Marshall - before making this announcement. This has not just been made on a whim.

And it is the right decision because he has made it himself. England would have definitely been richer for his presence and experience in the Euro 2016 qualification campaign but the baton has now been passed on.

He is going on his own terms and that will inevitably benefit Liverpool, particularly with an assault on the Champions League looming.

Gerrard, who turned 34 in May, explained: 'Brendan has been fantastic and obviously I have to look after my body as much as possible to ensure I can give everything when I take to the field.

‘To ensure I can keep playing to a high level and giving everything to Liverpool Football Club I believe this is the right decision, and having Champions League football back at Anfield is another big factor in my decision.'

Luis Suarez may have been crowned the PFA and FWA Player of the Year last season, after his 31 goals propelled Liverpool to the brink of the Barclays Premier League title, but the influence Gerrard had on the assault should not be underestimated. His slip against Chelsea that gifted Demba Ba a crucial goal may still be fresh in the memory but that should not be why his most recent campaign is remembered.

Gerrard was brilliant last season, the driving force in a number of crucial wins, converting ice-cool penalties and dictating play from a deep-lying position. It has been called the 'Pirlo role' but on Merseyside it has become known, simply, as the 'Gerrard role'.

He still has much to give at the highest level and nobody at Anfield is looking forward more to hearing that instantly recognisable Champions League music blasting out from the speakers once more and coming up against the biggest names in Europe; showdowns with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona are what Liverpool's No 8 is made for and saying goodbye to England will mean he is primed for such occasions.

But do not think that he has relished terminating a journey that started in May 2000 against Ukraine and, ultimately, ended with a brief substitute appearance against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte. He loved putting Three Lions on his chest - that was abundantly clear one Friday morning on a schoolyard in Huyton.
