Tracey Pascall was ordered to pay Wendy and Andrew Petford £10 after conning them out of £4,500 by pretending to have terminal cancer

A mother-of-three lied about dying from cancer to avoid paying back a loan of £4,500 after friends parted with their daughter's wedding fund to help her.

Tracey Pascall conned Wendy and Andrew Petford, telling the couple she had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.

But the 47-year-old was ordered to pay back just £10 - all the money she has to her name - when she was sentenced to two years in prison at Stafford Crown Court.

The couple said the amount was an 'insult' leaving them feeling like they have been 'slapped in the face'.

Mrs Petford, 47, from Telford, in Shropshire, said: 'Ten pounds is a massive insult. I feel like I have been slapped in the face.

'To hear that she only has to pay £10 back is like she’s taking the mick out of us even more - it is so insulting.'

Mrs Petford was a close friend of Pascall, after the pair met at teacher training college in the late 90s. They were reunited when Pascall got back in touch via Facebook in February 2011. After meeting up she asked to borrow money from Mrs Pascall, claiming she was waiting for funds to clear on her account.

To back up her claims Pascall forged letters, claiming she had £54,000 in a Post Office account.

Mrs Petford had no reservations about lending her friend the money.

She and her husband had saved £4,500 for their daughter's wedding but agreed to lend it to Pascall.

But the mother-of-three, who faked a 
persistent cough, later told the couple she was dying of lung cancer and
 could not pay back the loan.

Mr
 and Mrs Petford asked Pascall for the money weekly, but their attempts 
were met with lies about their friend's worsening condition and forged 
letters from the bank.

Pascall with Wendy Petford had known each other for years. After Pascall got back in touch, she asked Mrs Petford to borrow the money

The
 Petford’s eventually realised Pascall was lying after her letters were 
exposed as fakes when the couple visited the solicitor with her.

Mr Petford went to meet Pascall to collect a cheque from the solicitors.

Mrs
 Petford said: 'Andrew said he would go with her, not to try and catch 
her out, just because he thought it would be easier. I didn’t realise 
until afterwards but she looked panicked.

'He got there and was told there was no cheque, and when he showed them the letter they said it wasn’t one of theirs.

'They had to call the police. Andrew 
came home and told me. That’s when the realisation hit home. If that 
letter’s forged, are the others?

'The next day the police called us and us and asked us to go down. We took all the letters.'

But a hearing under the Proceeds of 
Crime Act this month revealed Pascall had just £10 to her name and so 
would only have to repay that amount to the couple.

Pascall forged a letter from her solicitors to show the Petfords 'proof' that she had £54,000 in a Post Office account

Another forged letter from Barclays claimed to show her bank account had been frozen while the bank's fraud team investigated unusual payments

Judge Robin Onions said: 'Unfortunately you can’t get blood out of however undeserving a stone.'

Mrs Petford added: 'She said I’d get the money back and I never doubted her for a second.

'To say she had cancer, that’s lower than low.

'When
 we were younger we told each other everything and I used to see her 
every day. We were part of a big group, but we spent a lot of time 
together.

'She got back in 
touch and we went for a drink. Tracey ordered a bottle of champagne. 
That was her all over - she was always glamorous and I never saw her in 
the same clothes twice.

'The whole situation broke me apart. I was off work with depression and had to leave my job. She never even said sorry.

'And the fact that she will only have to pay us £10 back, is the final insult. We are gutted.'

Speaking
 after Pascall was sentenced in September, Mrs Petford, said the couple 
had focused on their daughter's wedding as a way of getting through 
their ordeal.

Andrew, left, and Wendy Petford had to focus on the wedding of their 
daughter Michaela, pictured with baby Olivia, to husband James to take 
their mind off the stress caused by Pascall's fraud

'The wedding was supposed to have been
 in 2013, but when Michaela sets her mind on something she always wants 
it done straight away,' she said.

'We had three weeks to prepare the wedding, and without the money it was going to be tough, but we wanted to get through.

'Originally
 they were going to deal with it all themselves. They were going to go 
to a pub for the reception, but it was a very small pub. They wouldn’t 
even be able to get us all in there.

'We decided that because we had nothing but bad luck, hurt and pain that we wanted to do it better than the pub.

'We scraped together, and although it wasn’t the big wedding she should have had, it was still a wonderful day.'

Michaela married her fiancee James Corfield on December 9, 2011, at The Lord Hill Hotel in Shrewsbury.
