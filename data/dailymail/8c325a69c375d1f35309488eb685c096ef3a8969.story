Rio's favelas are a notorious part of the city’s history, a vibrant but often troubled part of modern Brazil.

I was guided around one last week and even though this particular favela, Santa Marta, is known as a place where the people’s worst troubles are behind them, it was a humbling and shocking experience.

At the heart of it there is a football pitch for kids, fenced like a cage, where young people can play in safety. But you can see bullet holes in the walls of the adjoining shanty homes.

Humbling and shocking experience: Ferdinand visited the Santa Marta favela in Rio

My guide, a local guy named Edu, said that at the depths of the drug feuds that infested this community, rival gangs would decapitate each other and kick the severed heads around.

One bloke who follows me on social media joked that I’d be fine in a favela because I grew up in Peckham. I pointed out as nicely as possible that we have it cushy in Britain. The grinding poverty and social extremes in Rio’s poorest districts is something else.

Around 1.4 million people live in about 750 favelas in Rio alone. With drugs and the attendant gun culture, murder is commonplace.

Santa Marta was one of the earliest cases of a favela being ‘pacified’, with a concerted effort by the authorities and local community to tackle gang culture.

The police and community work in harmony. You can play football in the alleys, and I did have a kickabout while there.

I met extraordinary people, including a guy who cleans the streets for a living and begs in his ‘spare’ time to raise money that he donates to a local scheme that provides football facilities for kids.

People like that are the glue that binds communities together.
