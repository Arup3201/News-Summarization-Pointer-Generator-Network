A woman who suffered the agony of losing three babies was stunned when she unexpectedly became pregnant with triplets - all in the space of two years.

Gemma Schollick, 28, and her husband Stephen, 30, were devastated after the stillbirth of their daughter and a further two miscarriages.

The couple decided to stop trying for a baby, instead concentrating on the three children they already had - Ben, eight, Josh, six, and five-year-old Sophie.

In an attempt to put their heartache behind them, they decided to get married, but while they were on honeymoon in Cornwall in July 2011, Mrs Schollick became pregnant again unexpectedly.

After early scans, the couple were told they were expecting twins - but at a later scan, Mrs Schollick was ‘beside herself’ to be told she was expecting triplets.

The discovery came after a string of heartaches for the couple from Haltwhistle, Northumberland.

In early 2010, Mr and Mrs Schollick learned that they were expecting a baby.

Although unplanned, the couple eagerly awaited the birth of their daughter - whom they had decided to call Amelia.

Mrs Schollick carried Amelia full term, but during an antenatal appointment on December 27, 2010, medical staff were unable to find a heartbeat.

The couple were told their daughter had died.

Two days later - on Amelia's due-date – Mrs Schollick gave birth to the still-born baby.

The couple discovered their baby had died more than a week earlier, leaving Mrs Schollick dangerously ill with a uterine infection.

The couple had a stillborn daughter, Amelia, just a year before the triplets were born. She was born on her due date but had died in the womb

‘It was really hard, really difficult,’ said Mrs Schollick, a part-time leisure centre worker.

‘It was an awful couple of days between finding out and giving birth. We didn't go out of the house. We were in limbo.

‘We used those two days to come to terms with what went on and what was going to happen.

‘The worst part was telling the kids. Ben, Josh and Sophie were all young but we had to tell them something, they were expecting a baby sister.

‘We said that Amelia had been poorly and the doctors couldn't fix her.

‘Then Sophie said, “Well you'll just have to have another one”.

‘Looking at Stephen, I knew he felt the same, and we started trying again as soon as we could.'

Within
two months, Mrs Schollick found out that she was expecting again, but 
at a scan she found out the baby had stopped growing and died.

In early 2010 Mr and Mrs Schollick learned they were expecting a baby.

Their daughter, Amelia, was stillborn on December 29, 2010.

In February 2011 Mrs Schollick became pregnant again but she miscarried.

Within three months of the miscarriage, she conceived again.

The baby died six weeks into the pregnancy.

In July 2011 the triplets were conceived during the couple's honeymoon.

They were born on January 29, 2012.

The couple were desperate for another baby, but three months later, they were apprehensive when Mrs Schollick became pregnant again.

Their fears were realised, when she suffered a second miscarriage at six weeks.

‘After everything we had been through I couldn't cope with anything more,’ said Mrs Schollick.

‘We decided to stop trying and just leave it to fate. If it was meant to happen it would happen.’

In the summer of 2011, the family decided to go on holiday to Cornwall, where, unknown to their family and friends, they decided to get married.

During their honeymoon, Mrs Schollick conceived again.

Because of the earlier problems, the couple wasted no time in visiting the hospital for a scan.

‘It was the same nurse that had told me Amelia had died,’ said Mrs Schollick.

‘Running the scanner over my stomach, she turned to me and said, “I don't know how to tell you this”, and I just thought, “oh no, not again,” but then she announced, “it's twins”.

‘But I just couldn't get excited, if anything I was more scared. I thought I was going to lose another two babies.’

Mrs Schollick was in for a further shock. When she attended the second scan, she was told she was not expecting two babies, but three.

‘When the nurse first said I was having triplets I thought she was winding me up.

‘I sat in the car park for half an hour after the scan and just cried my eyes out. I was so scared.'

Mrs Schollick was too fearful to get excited, with the previous miscarriages never far from her mind.

‘I was just going through the motions,’ she said. ‘I didn't buy anything for the babies - I didn't want to tempt fate.’

The triplets were born nine weeks early but all are now healthy one-year-olds and Mrs Schollick says that the family is now complete

The situation was put into perspective, however, when medics explained the high risk of miscarriage with triplets.

Having lost three babies in a row, Mrs Schollick was quick to decline the offer of reducing the number of foetuses she was carrying in order to give the remaining ones a stronger chance of survival.

She said: ‘You can't pick and choose, can you? I just realised that whatever was meant to be, would be.’

The couple had previously found out they were expecting three boys and chose the names, Aidan, Alfie and Andrew.

‘I wanted a natural delivery, but they said no because Alfie's cord was a lot thinner than it should have been, but as it was, he came out naturally and quickly,’ said Mrs Schollick.

‘They were already performing the caesarean section, so the other two were born that way.’

They were born on January 29 last year, nine weeks early.

Alfie was the smallest at 2llb 2oz, his identical twin, Andrew, was 3lb 3oz and Aidan was 3lb 6oz.

After a rocky start due to their small size, the triplets are now happy one-year-olds, with very different personalities.

‘Aidan's the softy,’ said Mrs Schollick. ‘He loves his cuddles.

‘Andrew is quite cheeky. He's the nosy one, if anyone comes in the house he's first to investigate.

‘Alfie is the strong one. He never gives up on anything.

‘It's hectic sometimes and six kids might seem like a lot to some, but this mad house is the only place I'd want to be.

‘I'll never forget Amelia and our other babies, but finally our family is complete.’
