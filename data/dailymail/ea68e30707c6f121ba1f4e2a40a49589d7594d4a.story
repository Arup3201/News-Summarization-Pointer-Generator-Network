She may have been fired by Lord Sugar on week seven of The Apprentice, but that hasn't stopped Lauren Riley from pursuing her business dreams.

The 28-year-old solicitor, who was fired after an advertising task in New York, is keen to show the world that there's more to her and to dispel the image of a stuffy solicitor from this season's BBC show.

Lauren, from London, says she's determined to give the law industry a 'modern and sexier facelift' and encourage women to embrace their beauty as well as their brains.

So does the entrepreneur, who has been dubbed 'Luscious Lauren', believe that good looks hinder women in business?

'I can imagine situations where this could happen, although I have done my best not to allow myself to be hindered,' she told MailOnline.

'When you are new to any role you will be judged on many factors and unfortunately the first one is bound to be looks. I remember as a trainee solicitor, me and a couple of other female trainees being compared to Girls Aloud. Or the odd comments when we were introduced to the staff floor by floor, that we looked more like models on a catwalk.

'Luckily for us, our warm personalities and competency at our jobs quickly silenced these murmurs. It was only years later that we learnt the full extent of how we had been judged that first day. 

'If people think I am good looking then I do not think it hindered me at that time but I'm sure it didn't help either. You definitely have extra pressure to be good at your job and to prove that you're more than just a pretty face.' 

Hindered: Lauren explains that as a trainee solicitor, she and a couple of other female trainees were compared to Girls Aloud and it was once said that they looked more like models on a catwalk

Despite her strong beliefs, Lauren says she is 'ashamed' to admit that, in the past, she's felt pressure to change the way she dressed in the workplace. 

She explained: 'When I first started in law I was conscious of power dressing, wearing less make-up and tying my hair back in an effort to be taken more seriously. 

'As I have got older and more experienced I have realised that if someone judged me based on anything but my ability to carry out my work then that was their problem.' 

Lauren, who is 'delighted' by the emails and tweets she receives from younger women who have said she inspired them to look to law or business as a career, wants to help others follow in her footsteps.

She has been asked to speak next year by the Junior Law Society and wants to work to inspire young women to go into industries that are particularly male orientated without fear of being intimidated simply because of their gender.

'I would like to see some more positive female women in business who get media attention for the right reasons,' she said.

On a mission: While she didn't make the final in Lord Sugar's boardroom, Lauren says she has had plenty of interest in her new app and she wants it to become a  household name 

'Attitudes to women in business need to change, women should feel confident enough to dress how they feel comfortable and embrace their femininity without worrying about being judged. Men never worry about how they look or dress in the work place because they are confident in knowing that they will be judged purely on their work ethic, it should be the same way for women.'

Lauren's first port of call is promoting her new start-up, The Link App. Lauren describes her app as the 'ultimate tool for busy law firms looking to thrive in an increasingly competitive market, improve customer service, save time and money, and increase productivity'.

While she didn't make the final in Lord Sugar's boardroom, Lauren says she has had plenty of interest in her new app and she wants it to become a global firm and a household name.

Meanwhile, back in Lord Sugar's boardroom, after 10 weeks of tasks and a series of gruelling interviews, the two finalists going head-to-head in this year's Apprentice final have been revealed.

South Londoner Bianca Miller and Australian Mark Wright will battle it out to become Lord Sugar's next Apprentice during Sunday's final.

The pair are fighting for the chance of Lord Sugar's £250,000 investment in their business plans.
