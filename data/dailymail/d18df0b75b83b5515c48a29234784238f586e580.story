Robert Williams, the ex wife of slain gangland figure Carl Williams, has admitted to being devastated by the latest news her eldest daughter has been charged with attempted murder.

Danielle Stephens Williams was granted conditional bail in Melbourne's magistrates court on Friday after being charged with the attempted murder of a Melbourne man, who was taken to hospital with several gunshot wounds.

The Herald Sun reported Sanar Ghanin, Stephen's boyfriend, is in custody after also being charged with the murder Serkan Kala in Melbourne.

Nine News reported The court was told the 22-year-old allegedly drove Mr Ghanin and his friend to confront the man, over a dispute, in Broadmeadows on Monday night.

Robert Williams said she didn't want her children to follow in her footsteps and tried to give them the best of everything.

'Hence the reason why I have tried to give them that private school education, the things I didn't have in life, the mum that is there if they need someone to talk to,' she told the Herald Sun.

'I often say to my kids, ­'society owes you nothing.'

Ms Williams who has vowed to stand by her daughter has described her as a 'good kid', hoping they can get past these accusations.

Once the wife of criminal kingpin, Carl Williams, she said her life has now changed dramatically and it's now all about being a mum.

'I feel I was put on this earth to be a mum, that is a job I take very seriously,' she said.

Danielle is one of three children from Ms Williams' relationship with Dean Stephens, a close associate of the Moran crime family.

Fairfax media reported the pair have been assessed as suffering severe mental impairment after the brutal death of Carl Williams in prison four years ago. 

An independent panel of psychologists and psychiatrists reportedly found they had a level of impairment which was believed to be at least 50 per cent. 

Although Victorian premier Denis Napthine says the government would protect taxpayers' interests at 'every opportunity' and fight the decision if there were any compensation payments to Roberta Williams, a convicted drug dealer.

Ms Stephens is scheduled to return to court on Monday to sign an intervention order and will be scheduled to back in court again in February.
