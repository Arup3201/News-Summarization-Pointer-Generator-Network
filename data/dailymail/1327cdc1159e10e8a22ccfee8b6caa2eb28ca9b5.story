Nick Clegg has said he wants to spend ten years as Deputy Prime Minister – and would refuse to prop up either of the main parties in a minority government.

The Liberal Democrat leader said if both Labour and the Tories failed to win a majority in next year’s election, he would accept nothing less than another Coalition.

He spoke as a YouGov poll yesterday showed support for the Lib Dems is at a feeble 9 per cent ahead of the European elections on May 22 – meaning the party could lose all 11 of its MEPs.

Coalition partners: Tory David Cameron and Lib Dem Nick Clegg

This lack of popular support suggests that if the Lib Dems do enter a second coalition, they may be disproportionately represented in Parliament.

Mr Clegg described coalition as a ‘fascinating laboratory’ of ideas and said: ‘I’d very much like to  continue in government.’

Figures close to David Cameron and Ed Miliband have privately said they wish to rule alone in the event of another hung parliament.

But Mr Clegg said: ‘My party would not be interested in propping up a minority government without coalition. It isn’t a role I would see as right for myself or the Liberal Democrats... We’ve only just got started, and a ten-year period for us in government means we could make a majority contribution. The last thing I want to do is give up this job.’

He criticised Labour and the Tories for 
wanting to go it alone, saying: ‘It’s swashbuckling stuff, but when it 
comes down to it  a minority government would  be unstable. And it’s 
irresponsible.

Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, spoke out against minority government last week - saying it was unstable

'We are still living in difficult times and difficult times require strong government, capable of taking tough decisions and with the majority in Parliament to make sure they happen.’

The 2010 election ended in a hung parliament, meaning no party had a majority among MPs. As a result, the Tories and Lib Dems formed a Coalition. If there is a hung parliament again in 2015, one option would be another coalition.

The next step down would be for Labour or the Tories to form a minority government and enter a ‘confidence and supply’ agreement with a smaller party. The smaller party – the Lib Dems – would not have ministers in the Cabinet, but would promise to help the Government and to support it in a vote of no confidence.

Without this support, a minority government would be unable to get things done and could be forced to resign in a no confidence debate.

Mr Clegg’s comments indicate he would force a second election if he failed to get a coalition. He told a Sunday newspaper that he wanted the Lib Dems to be a ‘political force in the life of this country – not just a think-tank’.

It means there will be no return to the Lib-Lab pact of the 1970s, when Liberal David Steel kept a minority Labour government in power.

Last week Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, also spoke out against minority government, saying it is ‘unstable’ and would ‘not be in the national interest’ as it could not take tough decisions to protect the recovery.

He will be in charge of negotiating with the main parties in the ‘likely’ event of a hung parliament, and said the Lib Dems would be willing to form a coalition with either Labour or the Conservatives.
