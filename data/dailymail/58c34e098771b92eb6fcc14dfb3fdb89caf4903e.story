These remarkable pictures show a selection of elaborately adorned animals taking part in the prettiest camel competition.

The camels can be seen dressed in coat-like decorations made entirely from brightly coloured pom-poms and other woven materials. The animals even have necklaces and headdresses - decorated with delicate jewels and beads.

The competition was held at the Pushkar Fair, in the Thar desert, India this week.

Who is the fairest of them all? A competition to find the world's prettiest camel was held at the Puskhar Fair, India, last week

Looking lovely: The animals were dressed pom-poms, beads, and jewels for the competition - which is thought to have been running for decades

The gathering - during which in the 
region of 20,000 camels are bought and sold - attracts thousands of 
tourists from around the world.

The
camel beauty pageant, which has been held for decades, is taken very 
seriously. In fact, one competitor was furious after his pride and joy 
failed to win top prize.

Despite
dolling up his animal with customary pom-poms and jewels, Ashok Tak, 
was bitterly disappointed when his 10ft animal failed to win.

Former winner Mr Tak,  who has run a camel beauty parlour for nearly 30 years, can be seen atop his animal holding an umbrella in one of the pictures.

However,
for Rocky the camel it was a good day - as it was crowned overall 
winner of the coveted award. His owner Hukma Ram was said to be thrilled
to have won.

Disappointment: Ashok Tak, seen riding his animal with the orange umbrella, was not happy his camel was unable to clinch the top prize

The Pushkar Fair, otherwise known as Pushkar ka Mela, is held every year. It is a five-day camel and livestock fair and is believed to be one of the world's largest.

The prettiest camel award is not the only competition the fair hosts - attendees may also compete for the title of 'longest moustache' or 'prettiest bride',

In recent years a cricket match between the local Pushkar club and a team of foreign tourists has also taken place.

The Thar Desert, sometimes referred to as the Great Indian Desert, is in the northwestern area of India and forms a natural boundary running along the border between India and Pakistan.
