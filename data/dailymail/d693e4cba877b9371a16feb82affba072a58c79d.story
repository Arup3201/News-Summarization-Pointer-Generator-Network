The Professional Footballers' Association have slated the 'inadequate' fine imposed by UEFA on Serbia for racist abuse and violence towards England Under 21 players.

UEFA's independent control and disciplinary panel fined the Serbian FA just £65,000 - a remarkable £15,000 less than Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner was forced to pay for showing branded boxers as part of a goal celebration - for their part in the ugly post-match scenes.

In a statement issued today, the PFA said they were looking to UEFA to send a strong message to the football community that racism would not be tolerated in the game, but were left disappointed by the sanctions.

Anger: Rose reacts to the racist taunts

The statement said: 'The PFA has 
expressed its dismay at the totally inadequate fine levied by UEFA 
against the Serbian FA after the disgraceful scenes of racism and 
violence during the recent Under 21 match with England. 

'Everybody has been looking to the 
Confederation to send out a strong message as a deterrent to ensure that
behaviour such as this is eradicated from our game.  Unfortunately once
more a disappointing penalty has been imposed.'

Chief executive Gordon Taylor was 
outraged by the perceived leniency of the panel's decision, and expressed his disappointment that England 
players Tom Ince and Steven Caulker were banned for their part.  

Caulker was banned for two games, and Ince is set to miss one match through suspension.

He said: 'This is a totally inadequate fine which sends a very poor message out 
to the football world.  I intend to write to Michel Platini expressing 
our dissatisfaction and calling for stronger action.  In addition, we 
will strongly support the FA in their appeal against the decision to 
charge Steven Caulker and Thomas Ince.

Platini is considering an appeal to increase the one-match spectator ban and 80,000 euro fine imposed on Serbia.

Too lenient? Michel Platini could lodge an appeal

UEFA itself can appeal to increase 
the severity of the punishment. UEFA sources said Platini has taken note
of the sanction and will make a final decision once he has read the 
full file on his return from Japan next week.

The European body’s prosecuting inspector had proposed more 'drastic' measures, the Serbian federation has admitted.

The PFA are not alone in their incredulity after the relatively lax punishment.

Liverpool manager Brandan Rodgers today said: 'I saw it yesterday and felt for all the England players and staff who were there. It is bitterly disappointing to say the least.

'The sanction is not too dissimilar to someone showing a sponsor on a pair of pants. I thought it was poor really. But it is up to them.'

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce added: 'To see the English players punished as well is a little difficult to take. Everybody was looking to see what UEFA might do and I think what they have done is try to just get this one over with as quick as they can and not dealt with it severely enough.

Saying his piece: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers expressed his disappointment at UEFA's decision

'We should ask UEFA, what are your policies on racism? Let’s get those policies and see if they are good enough to deal with racism. If I was Nicklas Bendtner I’d ask for my fine back.'

QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, the 
target of racial abuse by John Terry last year, also contrasted the sanction 
against Serbia with the 100,000 euro and one-match ban handed to former 
Arsenal striker Bendtner for displaying a betting firm’s logo on
his underpants during Euro 2012.

Ferdinand tweeted: 'Wow UEFA ain’t serious with their punishment... So showin a sponsor is worst than racism and fighting!'

His brother Rio added: 'Uefa are not 
serious at all on racism. Fines do not work at all. They have zero 
impact on federations/clubs/fans/players #fact.

'Uefa need to talk to this 
generation.....they don’t seem to be up to date on this issue?? Harsh 
punishments needed as a deterrent #simple.'

The Football Association also 
criticised the sanction and will appeal against two-match and one-match 
bans for Steven Caulker and Tom Ince respectively.

FA general secretary Alex Horne said:
“We are disappointed with the sanctions levied by UEFA with regards to 
the racist behaviour displayed towards England’s players.

'Let’s be clear, racism is 
unacceptable in any form, and should play no part in football. The 
scenes were deplorable and we do not believe the sanction sends a strong
enough message.'

The FA reported the racist abuse to UEFA plus a number of other incidents.

Full-back Danny Rose, who was 
dismissed after the final whistle for kicking the ball away in anger, 
complained he had been subjected to monkey chants throughout the match 
and as he left the pitch.

Serbian FA secretary general Zoran 
Lakovic appeared to suggest that the UEFA official prosecuting the 
charges had also demanded tougher action.

Lakovic said in a statement: 'If we 
take into account what the drastic proposed penalty by the disciplinary 
inspector Jean-Samuel Leube we have not been hit so hard.

That's pants: Denmark's striker Nicklas Bendtner was fined £80,000 for showing bookmakers' logo

'I believe that this is a final 
warning to all of us who work in Serbian football, including coaches and
players and fans, because for even the smallest mistake UEFA can now 
impose the most rigorous punishment.'

Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of Kick
It Out, slammed the sanction as “a paltry slap on the wrist”, adding: 
'Again we haven’t seen decisive action from UEFA.'

Piara Powar, executive director of 
European anti-discrimination body FARE, said UEFA had failed to display 
the necessary leadership.

Powar said: 'The original offences warranted a more severe collective punishment than a ban on spectators for one match.

'This is a moment in which leadership
to challenge discrimination is needed from all authorities. This 
sanction falls short of that objective.'

Serbia and the FA have three days in 
which to lodge an appeal - while UEFA themselves can also appeal against
the control and disciplinary body if they too think the independent 
commission has been too lenient.
