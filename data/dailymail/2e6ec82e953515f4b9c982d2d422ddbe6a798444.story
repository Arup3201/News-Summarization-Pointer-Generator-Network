Shopping trolleys abandoned, bags dropped on the floor and beer bottles left where they stand, these haunting images show the shops which were deserted in the aftermath of the Nairobi mall massacre which left 67 people dead and dozens more missing.

Carts full of goods were left standing in Westgate Mall as shoppers fled for their lives when jihadi terrorists rushed the building and started gunning down customers.

The photographs show how people apparently dropped bags on the ground as they made their escape, forming a disturbing portrait of the moment chaos broke out.

Dormans coffee shop on the ground floor of the mall: Abandoned trolleys, dropped shopping bags and coffee cups left on the tables show the chaos as people fled for their lives before the gunfire

Attack: Bags, beers and personal belongings were left behind in the Artcaffe. As the gunmen walked through the mall, shooting anyone in sight, shoppers ran, hid or died

One
 popular restaurant, Artcaffe, still has purses and handbags on the 
tables, as well as empty bottles of beer, making it look as if customers
 had only left for a minute.

But in other shops the floors are covered in broken glass, hinting at the violence which broke out at the mall on September 21.

In FoneXPress, which sells mobile phones and other hi-tech goods, the shelves appear to have been looted, with products smashed on the floor along with their glass cases.

Other images show how the mall's car park was destroyed by explosives during the attack, while police are currently examining the remains of burnt-out vehicles in the area in a bid to gather clues on the origins of the atrocity.

Empty: The Artcaffe restaurant and coffee shop is situated on the ground floor of Westgate. Little damage can be seen here compared to the devastation in other areas of the mall

Chaos: The FoneXpress computer store is littered with debris, and its cabinets are bare, showing signs of looting reported by businesses throughout the mall

Forensics: Investigators work in the mall passageways scouring the building for clues which may lead to other terrorists involved in the attack

Another
 39 people remain unaccounted for almost a week after the end of the 
attack, the Red Cross 
said today.

Its report conflicts 
with the government's contention that there are no remaining missing 
people from the attack on the Westgate Mall and suggests that the death 
toll could still rise as investigators dig through the rubble.

'The
 numbers with us are what we are still showing as open cases that are 
reported to us', Kenyan Red Cross head Abbas Gullet said.

'The
 only way to verify this is when the government declares the Westgate 
Mall 100 per cent cleared - then we can resolve it.'

Explosion: Burnt-out vehicles have been abandoned outside Westgate as the work of clearing up the mall continues

The Red Cross number has been dropping
 over the past week as bodies have been positively identified and as 
some missing people have been reunited with their families. On Friday it
 said the number of missing was 59.

On
 Sunday Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku said that police had no 
missing persons reports from the attack, and did not believe there were 
any hostages in the mall building when it partially collapsed. He left 
open the possibility, however, that things might change.

'We
 think - unless the forensic investigation shows otherwise - we really 
do think that there were weren't any hostages,' he said.

Entrance: The scene outside the mall's main gate remains chaotics nine days after the initial outbreak of violence

Investigation: Forensic police inspect a saloon car parked near the main entrance of the mall

Investigators
 from Britain, Canada, the U.S. and Germany, are helping in the 
investigation into the attack and are aiding Kenyan forensic experts 
poring through the mall complex. Results are not expected until later 
this week at the earliest.

In
 addition to the 61 civilians and six troops reported killed in the 
attack, the government has said five of the attackers were killed by 
gunfire and at least one more is thought to be in the building's rubble.

The
 militant group al-Shabab has said it carried out the mall attack to 
punish Kenya for sending its troops into neighboring Somalia to fight 
the Al Qaeda-linked militant group that had seized large parts of that 
country for years before being dislodged from the capital, Mogadishu.
