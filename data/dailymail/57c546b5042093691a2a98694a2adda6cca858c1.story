The average person takes 2.3 seconds to unlock their phone, and does this almost 40 times a day, which over the course of a year, works out as 10 hours wasted.

But now, unlocking devices can be as simple as swiping an arm.

Motorola has created a range of digital tattoos the size of a penny that stick to a person’s wrist, or other body part.

Motorola has teamed up with California-based VivaLnk to create a range of digital tattoos the size of a penny that stick to a person’s wrist, or other body part. By linking the circuits in the waterproof patch (pictured) to a phone, users can unlock devices simply by holding them near their wrist

Using the tab, slowly peel a Digital Tattoo off the bottom liner of the
 tray. 

Place it on your skin and pull out the tab.

Apply pressure for 10-20 seconds.

Turn on your Moto X and unlock it manually.

Tap your Digital Tattoo to the back of your phone.

Press ‘Power’ to wake your phone.

Tap the back of your Moto X to the digital tattoo on your wrist to unlock.

By linking the circuits in the waterproof patch to a phone, users can unlock devices simply by holding them near their body.

Each digital tattoo is made of super-thin, flexible plastic embedded with a circuit and NFC chip.

It sticks to the skin using medical-grade adhesive, developed in partnership with experts at 3M, and the company claims it will last for five days.

This also means it can survive ‘showering, swimming and vigorous activities like jogging.’

Each patch is one inch (24.13mm) in diameter and has an unlock radius of 0.4 inches (10mm).

The technology was teased at last year’s All Things D conference.

Motorola executive Regina Dugan talked about new digital tattoos that would make it easier to unlock a phone.

‘Made of super thin, flexible 
materials, based on VivaLnk’s eSkinTM technology, each digital tattoo is
 designed to unlock your phone with just a touch of your Moto X to the 
tattoo, no passwords required,’ said Motorola.

‘The
 nickel-sized tattoo is adhesive, lasts for five days, and is made to 
stay on through showering, swimming, and vigorous activities like 
jogging. And it’s beautiful - with a shimmering, intricate design.’

The tattoos only currently work with Motorola's Moto X device (pictured). Each tattoo is one inch (24.13mm) in diameter with a 0.4 inch (10mm) unlock radius and a month's supply of 10 tattoos cost $9.99 (£6)
