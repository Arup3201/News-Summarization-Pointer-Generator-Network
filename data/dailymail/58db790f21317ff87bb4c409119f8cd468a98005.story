Ronnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from next week's China Open world ranking event for health reasons, according to worldsnooker.com.

The five-time world champion was set to meet either Yan Bingtao or Robin Hull in his opening match on Beijing next Tuesday, but the winner of that contest will now receive a bye to the last 32. 

O'Sullivan was last in action on Sunday in Wales when he lost 10-7 to Judd Trump in the final of the World Grand Prix.

39-year-old O'Sullivan was leading 7-4 in the match before Trump fought back to win the next six frames and the title. 

O'Sullivan will hope to be back in time to play at the World Championships starting next month, but admitted recently winning 10 world titles 'wouldn't change his life much' and insists he plays the Crucible tournament 'just to get away from home'.

He said: 'It's kind of serious but I've won it there five times and if I won it another five times it wouldn't change my life much.

'You just need to enjoy the occasion there. I've achieved everything I want to achieve.'
