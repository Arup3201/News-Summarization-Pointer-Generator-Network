An estate agent has been jailed after framing an innocent client for speeding in an attempt to escape a driving ban.

Noweed Parvez, 36, was caught by a speed camera doing 45mph in a 30mph zone, but tried to shift the blame by giving police the name and date of birth of his customer, Simon Maher.

Mr Maher, 35, was convicted of speeding without his knowledge despite the photographs showing an Asian man behind the wheel and Parvez's company logo on the car.

'Horrible nightmare': Simon Maher (pictured) was wrongly convicted of speeding after his estate agent, Noweed Parvez, gave police his details in an attempt to escape a driving ban

The unwitting father-of-four, 35, only discovered the conviction when a policeman contacted him to say a warrant had been issued for his arrest.

The former school caretaker eventually won his battle to clear his name after the picture of the speeding VW Golf GTI was fully analysed and the driver was proved to be the company boss who had been looking after Mr Maher's rented property.

It emerged Parvez had nine points on his driving licence and feared a road ban under the totting-up procedure. Mr Maher, from Darwen, Lancashire, suffered sleepless nights and weeks of stress.

Yesterday, he told of his ordeal after Parvez, of Colne Road, Burnley, admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice and was jailed for 12 months.

Mr Maher, who drives a Seat Leon, said: 'He totally abused my trust by using my personal details and I was furious when I found out it was him - I just wanted to go over to the shop and drag him over the counter, but I knew it wouldn’t do me any favours.

'Throughout this, I’ve suffered many sleepless nights, I’ve lost weight because I lost my appetite and I was having anxiety attacks too. It was a very stressful time.

'It was just one blunder after another. Not only was the man in the photo Asian and I am white, but the company logo was written all over the car. I’m glad he’s gone to jail but I wish he’d got more.

'It could have been so trivial, but it turned into a very serious matter and this man roped me into all of it.'

'Suffered anxiety attacks': Mr Maher was finally cleared when it was established that photographs from the speed camera showed an Asian man behind the wheel and Parvez's company logo on the car

Earlier, Burnley Crown Court was told how Parvez was caught speeding in his VW Golf by a speed camera in November 2010.

The following month he was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution but Parvez returned it falsely saying Mr Maher - who paid rent at one of his properties - was driving at the time and gave his date of birth but gave a bogus address in Accrington.

A notice was then sent to the fake address and when court officials failed to get a response, Mr Maher and was convicted in his absence by Hyndburn magistrates.

Last September, a shocked Mr Maher was contacted by phone by a warrants officer who was stood outside the Accrington house, read his rights - and insisted he attend court with him.

Mr Maher said: 'He said he was outside my house, but when I looked and saw there was nobody there. I laughed out loud, I thought it was a wind-up.

'It was only when a black van pulled up 20 minutes later outside my house and the man showed me his ID that panic set in. I was baffled. My wife and three-year-old boy had come back to the house by then.

'The man explained about the driving offence and when I said I had never owned that make of car, he would not listen.

'When I went to court and pleaded not guilty, the prosecution lawyer said to me I had already wasted lots of money and lots of man hours and that I was in very serious trouble

'I crumbled at this point. I wanted to wake up and realise this had been a horrible nightmare.'

Last November, Parvez was quizzed by police and owned up. He claimed he had panicked as he already had points on his licence, thought he might be in danger of being disqualified and falsely declared Mr Maher was the driver to avoid prosecution.

In mitigation, Nick Dearing said: 'He expresses great remorse for the fact Mr Maher had been dramatically inconvenienced and put to much stress.

'At the time of the offence, he had nine points on his licence and he needed his licence for his employment. To protect himself, he gave false details to avoid prosecution himself.'

But sentencing, judge Mr Recorder Michael Blakey told Parvez: 'I would be failing in my public duty if I didn’t come to the conclusion it’s so serious that an immediate custodial sentence is justified.'
