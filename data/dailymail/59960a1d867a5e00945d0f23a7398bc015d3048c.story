A teenage boy was killed in a terrifying industrial accident when he was dragged into machinery only weeks after starting an apprenticeship at an engineering plant.

Tragic Cameron Minshull was thought to have become trapped in an industrial metal lathe and suffered serious head injuries.

Paramedics rushed to the factory and the 16-year-old was airlifted to hospital where doctors desperately tried to save his life.

However, he died shortly after his arrival.

Tragedy: Cameron Minshull, 16, was killed when he was dragged into machinery at a factory just weeks after starting an apprenticeship

Police and the Health and Safety Executive had today launched an investigation into the tragedy at Zaffar Engineering UK in Bury, Greater Manchester.

The probe was due to examine the machinery as well as the company's health and safety policies.

Cameron, who lived in Unsworth, Bury, had only been working at the site for a matter of weeks after starting an apprenticeship when he left school.

He was flown by air ambulance to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester but was pronounced dead a short time later.

Cameron's devastated family said that his death would  leave ‘a big hole in many people’s hearts’.

The teenager, who had been a pupil at Castlebrook and Radcliffe Riverside high schools in Bury, left behind two sisters, aged two and 13, and a 15-year-old brother.

Grieving mother Joanne Hill said: 'We have lost a very precious part of our lives and there are no words to describe how we are feeling.

'Cameron was a much-loved son, brother, nephew, grandson and great-grandson and a friend to many. He will leave a big hole in many people’s hearts.'

Police and paramedics were called to the factory unit at 10.45am on Tuesday.

However, Cameron was pronounced dead at around 12.20pm that same day.

A spokesman from Greater Manchester Police confirmed that a probe into how Cameron died had been launched.

'A joint investigation by GMP and the Health and Safety Executive is now underway to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident,' he said.
