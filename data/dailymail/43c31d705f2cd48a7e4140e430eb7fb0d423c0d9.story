The federal government refused to let the son of a hero World War II pilot who fought and died for Australia become a citizen because his father died too early.

Former English teacher Dr Mark Cremin, 74, from East Sussex in the U.K., was amazed when his application for Australian citizenship was denied earlier this year.

His father, Flight Lieutenant Daniel Cremin, was born and raised in Sydney and took to the skies and died for his country as part of the RAF during World War II.

The lieutenant was commended for his courage and his name is listed among countless other Australians at the War Memorial in Canberra.

But that sacrifice was not enough for his son, Dr Cremin, to be recognised as an Australian citizen.

Dr Mark Cremin, left, aged 74, was denied Australian citizenship even though his father, right, was an Australian war hero who fought for the Royal Air Force.

Lt Cremin flew Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft as a flight instructor and part of 66 Squadron. Above, a squadron of Spitfire aircraft is pictured in 1944.

A dashing Lieutenant Daniel Cremin was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross. The Cross is granted 'for exceptional valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy'.

'My father was, and his family in Australia are, as Australian as anyone else in the country,' Dr Cremin, from East Sussex, said in an impassioned plea to a tribunal last month.

'My father even gave his life for the freedom of Australia,' he said.

Dr Cremin has extended family in Australia - his uncle even played for the Wallabies, the national rugby team.

But he cannot become a citizen because of a legal technicality.

Australians were considered 'British subjects' until citizenship laws went into force in 1949.

But Dr Cremin's dad died seven years before he would have automatically become a citizen.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal upheld the ruling against Dr Cremin two weeks ago.

Now he is unsure where to turn.

Dr Cremin said the law was 'perverse', 'unjust' and did a disservice to some Australian heroes.

'My father was singled out for his bravery in action, and he shouldered the responsibility of commanding a front line squadron... and his war record marks him down as an Australian and he like all those on the war memorial in Canberra have been listed as Australian,' he said.

'Now this Australian-ness is denied, treating them as if they were mercenaries because they have been excluded from being called Australian, by the ruling.'

Dr Cremin told Daily Mail Australia he wanted to become an Australian to be closer to the memory of his father who he never knew.

'The major reason is a sentimental one: of in some small way getting closer to my father,' he said.

Dr Cremin's adult son, Daniel - who is named after his grandfather - told Daily Mail Australia he hoped the Australian government would reconsider how they interpreted the law.

He said: 'I am very proud of my grandfather's courageous and selfless decision to leave his birthplace in Australia and travel thousands of miles to fight in the Middle East and Britain and eventually give his life for our freedom.'

'I'm sure there will be many Australians of my father's age who will be shocked to read of this unjust and discriminatory interpretation of a law that surely was not intended to preclude Australian war heroes and their children from claiming citizenship.

A spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said: 'Australian citizenship laws are necessarily very strict.

'These laws do not provide the Minister with discretionary power to grant citizenship in these cases.'

Dr Cremin is considering an appeal to the Federal Court.
