Young men suspected of falling for the warped ideology of ISIS are being arrested at a rate of almost one a day, it has emerged.   

Scotland Yard assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said ISIS is unlike any other threat Britain has faced before in its bid to recruit and corrupt people.

The national policing lead for counter-terrorism said  arrests were up 35 per cent as extremists try to radicalise 'misfits, criminals and the vulnerable'.

Scotland Yard assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said officers were now making arrests almost every day to pick up extremists trying to radicalise 'misfits, criminals and the vulnerable'

Armed police patrols have been stepped up in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, while Scotland Yard has issued a public plea for more money to deal with the mountains of electronic evidence involved in terror cases.

Ministers urged the public to be ‘vigilant’ and warned Britain is at 'very significant risk' from a terror attack by extremists. 

Mr Rowley said the threat posed by ISIS extremists, including those returning to the UK after fighting in Iraq  and Syria, had led to a sharp rise in police activity.

He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'It's very different. We're making 35 per cent more arrests now than we used to in counter-terrorism. It's nearly one arrest a day. 

'That comes out of the fact that we're not just dealing with a classic terrorist organisation organising plots across the world. 

'We're dealing with a group that's trying to create what you might call a corrupt cult of people, of followers who will act in their name. 

'They're trying to attract misfits, criminals and the vulnerable; and it's those people, not part of a bigger organisation, who may act of their own volition. That's the challenge for us – is to have good sight of them and be able to intervene with them.'

In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris last month, armed police were deployed to sites across London including St Pancras station

He confirmed that emergency plans to cope with a terror attack in the UK have been changed in the wake of the Paris shootings because it was 'not everything we anticipated'. 

Around 600 people are believed to have travelled to Syria and Iraq from the UK since the conflict began and around half have returned home.

Asked about the anti-terror unit's reaction to the Paris attacks, Mr Rowley said: 'In terms of our national firearms capability, we've asked is it strong enough? How's it placed? How's it organised?

'We've arranged to be able to deal with those sorts of events and we have some well-tested exercises and command and control regimes for working across the country on counter-terrorism.

'But you look at an event like Paris and you think not everything in that we anticipated, so we're going to have to make some refinements to our plans to improve.' 

He also shared Prince Charles's fears of how young people in the UK are being radicalised in their own communities.

The prince's comments on Islam and Christianity were broadcast in an interview with BBC Radio 2's The Sunday Hour with Diane Louise Jordan this morning

The Prince said it is a 'great worry' that so many young Britons who are yearning for adventure and excitement are being radicalised by 'crazy stuff' online voiced fears about the 'alarming' extent to which young people are being radicalised.

Mr Rowley said: 'That's the dynamic that worries us most of us all, is the ability of IS to reach in to communities.

'We've been making lots of appeals to communities over the past year asking them for increasing amounts of help and we've seen that, we've seen more information coming forward.'

The police have recently strengthened their cyber resources, leading to 1,000 'unsavoury' posts a week being taken down.

However, Mr Rowley said more money is needed to grow the anti-terror unit over the next year and discussions with the Government for funding are ongoing.

'We certainly need more money and that’s what we’re discussing with government at the moment,' he said.  

Last month chief constables across the country began reviewing how to strengthen the protection of their officers and the Jewish community in the light of the Paris terrorist attacks.

The police have also been giving the public tips on how to spot a potential terrorist in a drive to encourage people to report suspicious behaviour.

Leaflets given to commuters by officers this morning include six things which should set alarm bells ringing, including someone with a lot of mobile phones, vague travel plans or taking a keen interest in CCTV cameras.

Commuters have been given flyers promoting the confidential anti-terrorist hotline, which advise the public: ‘Don’t rely on others. If you suspect it, report it.’

Leaflets given to commuters by police today include six things which should set alarm bells ringing and urge them to report anything suspicious to specialist counter-terror officers

It makes clear that specialist counter-terror officers should decide whether something suspicious is important and could help to prevent an attack.

The leaflet adds: ‘Everyone has a role to play in helping to prevent terrorism. You can do this by remaining vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to the police.’

It sets out six types of suspicious activity to report to police, including:

Someone noticeable behaving differently for no obvious reason

Someone with a large number of mobile phones for no obvious reason

Someone with passports or other documents in different names for no obvious reason

Someone who travels for long periods of time but is vague about where they’re going

Someone buying or storing large amounts of chemicals for no obvious reason

Someone taking an interest in security, like CCTV cameras, for no obvious reason

The direct appeal to the public follows an increased police presence in central London.

The Metropolitan Police said the leaflets being handed out today were part of ongoing measures to educate the public and not a change in approach.
