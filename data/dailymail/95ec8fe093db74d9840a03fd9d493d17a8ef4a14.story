Souvenirs marking the birth of the future King are being sold off at half price just months after he was born.

The sale of the Royal baby goods by Buckingham Palace includes homeware, china, tankards and commemorative books.

Branded memorabilia is on sale for less than half price at the Queen's Gallery gift shop as well as on the online store.

Cut price: A limited edition loving cup will set you back £95 instead of an eye-watering £195

Only thing reduced: Royal baby-branded items are the only things going cheap

Less than half price: The commemorative collection has seen dramatic price cuts

The Prince George mugs, pillboxes and bowls are the only items that have been reduced which seems to suggest the shop may have too much still in stock after his birth in July.

Among the cut-price wares is a Prince George of Cambridge limited edition baby bowl which is now listed as £70 - discounted from £145.

The baby blue crockery was specially commissioned by the Royal Collection Trust and the design includes a lion and a unicorn as well as the words 'welcome to our royal baby'.

Made of fine bone china, the less-than-half-price bowl, one of only 500 made, is finished by hand with 22 carat gold and has elements from the Middleton family's coat of arms.

Christening: Sales of his christening shawl rocketed and the muslin wrap he was in also sold well

Other pricy trinkets include a limited edition loving cup which will set you back £95 instead of an eye-watering £195.

Cheaper items include a souvenir album reduced from £9.95 to £4.95, a tree decoration in the shape of a pram cut from £12.95 to £6 and a commemorative pillbox which is now £14.95 instead of £30.

Just after Prince George was born, sales of memorabilia and related objects went through the roof.

The aden + anais bird-decorated muslin 
wrap he was wrapped in by his parents upon leaving the Lindo Wing has 
already sold out, and the small, family-run Nottingham-based firm 
behind his white Merino wool christening shawl were also inundated by orders.

His mother Kate is cited as one of the most influential figures 
within the fashion industry, with anything she wears immediately flying 
off shelves and into wardrobes.
