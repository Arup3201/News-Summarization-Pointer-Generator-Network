The devastated widow of a man shot dead in a movie theater during a dispute over texting broke down today as she spoke out for the first time.

'In a blink of an eye, my 
whole world just got shattered into a million pieces,' Nicole Ouslon, 33, said at a press conference. 'And now I'm left
 trying to pick them up and put them all back together.

'It's
 so hard and it's so unbearable. But I want to thank you all for your 
thoughts and your prayers.'

Mrs Ouslon said she had been excited to have a rare date with husband Chad in Wesley Chapel, Florida on January 13, after leaving their 22-month-old daughter Lexy with a babysitter.

Pain: Nicole Oulson spoke at a press conference on Wednesday about the loss of her husband Chad, who was shot dead during an argument as they attended the cinema in Florida last week

Devastated: She appeared at the press conference with attorney TJ Grimaldi. As she spoke about the tragedy, she cried as she said how excited she had been to share a rare date day with her husband

As they watched the movie, the dedicated father monitored his phone for updates about Lexy, who had been feeling sick when they left home earlier that day, friends revealed to MailOnline.

When 71-year-old retired cop Curtis Reeves, who was sitting behind the couple, asked Mr Oulson to put his phone away, he refused and Reeves left to speak with a manager.

Learning that the manager was busy, Reeves returned to his seat and started arguing with Oulson.

Seconds into the argument, Oulson apparently threw a bag of popcorn at the older man, who then drew a pistol from his pocket and shot the 43-year-old dad in the chest.

The bullet passed through Nicoleâ€™s outstretched hand as she desperately tried to save her husband.

Happier times: Nicole said on Wednesday she was trying to pick up the pieces after losing 'the love of my life'

At the press conference on Wednesday, Nicole's hand remained bandaged as she spoke to the media.

As her voice trembled, she thanked the public for supporting her and her family 'during this horrible time of grief and sadness'.

'I'm still trying to recover from the shock,' she said.

'Me and my husband didn't get a date night very often, much less a whole day to spend together, so I was just so excited and looking forward to spending the day with the love of my life at a place of entertainment.'

Lawyers representing the Oulson family have confirmed that Lexy was unwell and that Chad was keeping a close eye on his phone in case he and Nicole had to leave early and go to pick her up.

Her lawyer TJ Grimaldi said she has 'unfortunately a very clear recollection of exactly what happened' in the movie theater' and was not happy with Reeves' claim that he was trying to protect himself.

'She doesn't understand what he was protecting himself from,' he said.

He added that Lexy was too young to understand what had happened to her father.

'We're all lucky she's as young as she really 
is,' he said. 'She doesn't understand everything. All she understands 
right now is that daddy's not there.'

Reeves, a father-of-two who was at the movie theater to see 'Lone Survivor' with his wife, was a former police chief in Tampa.

Since the incident he has told police he shot Oulson because he feared for his safety, sparking speculation that his lawyer will use Floridaâ€™s controversial Stand Your Ground defense.

After the shooting, another couple, Jamira and Michael Dixon, said they had a run in with Reeves in the same cinema back in December after they used their cell phone.

He appeared before Circuit Judge Lynn Tepper in Pasco County via video conference last week. Outside the courtroom, his lawyer said his client was 'heartbroken' that a life was lost in the shooting.

He has been charged with second-degree murder and is being held without bail at Land O' Lakes jail.

Chadâ€™s former colleagues at Sky Power Sports have set up a Facebook page to raise money for Nicole and Lexy. Visit the page here.
