For the second match in a row, illness prevented Mario Balotelli from taking to the pitch for Liverpool, but the Italian striker was still watching the Reds take on Chelsea from the comfort of his living room.

Dressed in a fetching onesie, Balotelli posted a snap to his Instagram page, alongside a rousing message to prove his devotion to the club. 

'This illness might prevent me from helping my team on the pitch but it will NOT stop me from supporting my team off the pitch,' Balotelli said. 'Come on guys.. COME ON LIVERPOOL.. YNWA.'

Balotelli's last appearance for Liverpool came in a second half cameo at Sunderland on January 10

The former AC Milan man missed Liverpool's win at Aston Villa on Saturday, and was unavailable for a second time as Brendan Rodgers' side drew against Chelsea at Anfield in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg.

He did, though, manage to join friends in Manchester on Sunday night to dine at the posh San Carlo restaurant, sparking rumours that he had recovered from his mystery illness.

That proved not to be the case though, as Rodgers' team-sheet on Tuesday night did not list Balotelli in the squad.

On the pitch this season, he has made 18 appearances for the Reds - 12 of which in the Premier League.
