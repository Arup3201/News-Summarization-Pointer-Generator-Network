Middle aged women who regularly do aerobics, Zumba or step classes are protecting themselves against breast cancer, research shows.

Doing half an hour’s vigorous activity a day – including squash or a spinning class – reduces the risk by a fifth.

Scientists also found that obese women are over 50 per cent more likely to develop the illness than those who are slim.

Women who did three hours of vigorous physical activity a week were found to be at 21 per cent lower risk than those who did little or no exercise

Around one in eight women in the UK eventually get breast cancer – around 50,500 a year – but there is growing evidence that a healthy lifestyle can hugely lower this risk.

Researchers at Oxford University spent three years following 126,000 women who had been through the menopause, and recorded whether they developed the disease. They also filled in detailed questionnaires about how often they exercised, their weight, diet and drinking and smoking habits.

Women who did three hours of vigorous physical activity a week were found to be at 21 per cent lower risk than those who did little or no exercise. This includes intensive gym classes such as spinning or dance workouts – but not gentle jogging, walking or cycling.

And women with the highest body fat were 55 per cent more likely to have developed the illness than those who were slim. Scientists have known for some time that being overweight or obese increases a woman’s risk of breast cancer. They think that fat cells increase levels of the hormone oestrogen, which encourages the growth of tumours.

But the Oxford team suspect that exercise may provide greater benefits in protecting against cancer, aside from simply preventing weight gain. One theory is that intensive physical activity further lowers the amount of oestrogen. 

Figures show that fewer than half of women meet the NHS’s recommended exercise guidelines of at least two-and-a-half hours a week

A breast cancer drug rejected by the NHS rationing body can extend survival times by five months, a study has revealed.

Eribulin could benefit up to 1,200 British women a year – but was turned down by NICE in 2012 because of a lack of evidence.

However a study involving 1,800 women found it increased survival time by three months for those with a type of breast cancer known as HER2 negative. And for women with another form called triple negative, the average survival time increased by five months, scientists at Leeds University found.

The drug – which costs many thousands of pounds a year – is given as an injection at the same time as women have chemotherapy.

The findings will be presented at the National Cancer Research Institute Conference in Liverpool today, and have been hailed as ‘encouraging’. Campaigners hope the research will prompt NICE to re-assess whether the drug could be given to patients on the NHS.

Professor Tim Key, a Cancer Research UK scientist from the cancer epidemiology unit at Oxford University, said: ‘What’s really interesting about this study is that [reduction in breast cancer risk] does not appear to be solely due to the most active women being slimmer, suggesting that there may be some more direct benefits of exercise for women of all sizes. 

'We don’t yet know exactly how physical activity reduces risk ... but some small studies suggest that it could be linked to the impact on hormone levels in the body.’

He said that more research was needed to look at the link between women’s hormone levels and the apparent prevention of cancer.

Women who are slim and fit in middle age have probably been so for most of their lives, so will have been experiencing any potential cancer-protecting benefits for years. 

But Professor Key said that taking up exercise or losing weight in middle age could still help prevent the illness.

Figures show that fewer than half of women meet the NHS’s recommended exercise guidelines of at least two-and-a-half hours a week.

But Alison Cox, head of cancer prevention at Cancer Research UK, said this study ‘confirms that the benefits of staying active go beyond just burning calories’.
