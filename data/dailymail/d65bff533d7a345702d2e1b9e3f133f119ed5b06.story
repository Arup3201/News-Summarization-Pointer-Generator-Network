The Kansas foster father who left a 10-month-old baby girl in a hot car for two hours resulting in her death is inconsolable, says his family.

Seth Michael Jackson, 29, was arrested after he found the unresponsive child inside his silver Dodge Charger and called emergency services.

The baby girl, known as Kadylak and also Anna, was being cared for by Jackson and his partner Payton Shroeder, 26, who are parents to two adopted boys, aged five and seven.

They were also fostering Kadylak's two older sisters.

Jackson's mother Dottie told NBC that she spoke to her son at 2am Friday.

'He wants to die,' she said. 'Seth's children - that's his life.'

The little girl's biological grandmother Cindy Poe, drove to Wichita to try and discover how the tragedy had occurred.

'Accidents do happen. We don't know if it was accident,' she told NBC station KSN. 'They have a lot of kids they take care of. I want answers.'

Jackson was arrested on an aggravated child endangerment charge and hauled to Sedgwick County Jail, the Wichita Eagle reported.

Schroeder has not been charged. He was already home 
when Jackson came in and assumed he'd brought the baby in, the paper reported.

Lieutenant
 Todd Ojile said Jackson picked up the 10-month-old from the babysitter 
and took her home about 4pm on Thursday. He went inside with a five-year-old child but had 'somehow forgotten' the baby strapped inside his car.

Hours
 later, Jackson saw something on television that made him 'remember the little girl was still in the car,' Ojile told reporters on 
Friday.

'They immediately rushed outside and found the child deceased in the vehicle,' he added.

Jackson and Schroeder called Wichita police about 7pm. First responders arrived minutes later and  pronounced dead at the scene.

Arrested: Jackson was booked into Sedgwick County Jail early morning on Friday on suspicion of aggravated endangerment of a child

Distraught: The little girl's biological grandmother, Cindy Poe, says she just wants to hold her baby girl one last time

One of 
the foster parents was 'hysterically crying' outside the house before they were both taken in by police for questioning.

'I just want see her, I just want to 
hold her, you know, for the last time,' the girl's biological grandmother, Cindy Poe, told KWCH-TV.

'That's what I'm 
trying to fight. They don't know if I can do that, I'm trying to fight 
to hold her.'

The couple's adoptive children were taken into protective custody.

'It’s very sad,' neighbor Sandy Jessogne told the Eagle. 'You wouldn’t expect it in your own yard.

'When I found out what happened I just couldn’t believe it.'

Another neighbor said the men were devoted parents.

'They are two of the most kind-hearted guys that I have ever met. And I hate that there's so much controversy right now with babies being left in the car, because I truly don't feel from the bottom of my heart they would ever do this on purpose,' Lindey TenEyck, who lives across the street, told NBC.

Temperatures in Wichita were sizzling at more than 95 degrees on Thursday.

After an hour, that kind of heat can make the inside of a car bake at nearly 130 degrees, The Weather Channel reported.
