Schoolchildren are being taught inside corridors, sheds and even a toilet because of overcrowding in classrooms, it has emerged. 

One school in Northumberland is not only having to turn pupils away, but is also being forced to teach children in make-shift classrooms, including a garden shed. 

Central First School in Ashington, which bought a double decker bus on eBay for use as a temporary classroom last year, has been finding new means of teaching its ever-growing pupil population.

Central First School is not only having to turn pupils away, but is also being forced to teach children in make-shift classrooms, including a garden shed

'We've had to turn toilets and cupboards into working spaces,' said headteacher David Godfrey.

'We've had to turn structures outside into working areas for displaying artwork and for teaching the STEM subjects [science, technology, engineering and mathematics].

'We have a very good reputation as a school and we're full to capacity. Regrettably we're having to turn pupils away.'

News of the school's creative approach to new classrooms comes as parents rush to meet tomorrow's deadline for primary school applications.

Applications are expected to be made for around 370,000 three and four-year-olds who are due to start school in the autumn.

This week many parents are rushing to meet tomorrow's deadline for primary school applications

In the North East, where Central First School is located, more than 80 schools are overcrowded

Figures obtained by the Labour Party suggest almost one in five primary schools (18 per cent) have more pupils than they have capacity for - which has forced many children into large classes or temporary, make-shift classrooms.

The party sent Freedom of Information requests to all 152 local education authorities in England, with 130 responding.

The responses also revealed that as well as Central First School's classroom bus, St John's Primary School in Bristol has annexed and converted an old police station to cope with demand.

And Gascoigne Primary School in Barking, east London, which has 1,200 pupils has sacrificed its playing field, library and old music block to build classrooms, as well as having eight portable classrooms on its playground. 

Mr Godfrey bought the double decker bus on eBay, ripping out the old seats and replacing them with desks and a plasma TV screen to create a space for 15 pupils.

Although the bus cost £5,000 and the transformation a further £3,000, it has still worked out much cheaper than building an extension and Mr Godfrey said his pupils love studying in the vehicle.

Mr Godfrey had looked into constructing a new build or renting porta cabins but said the cost of this ran into the hundreds of thousands.

It is feared the problem of overcrowding will only get worse, with more than three-quarters of councils saying they saw a need for extra primary school places within the next three years. Pictured are Tammy-Leigh Lane, 8 and Ryhs Davis, 7 at the shed classroom in Central First School's yard

Central First School headteacher David Godfrey said more funding is needed for oversubscribed schools to either extend their classrooms or re-build from scratch

The bus is a fully functioning classroom throughout the whole school day with lessons of up to 12 being held on the top deck and smaller groups of two or three downstairs.

Responses to the Freedom of Information request also suggested the problem of overcrowding would only get worse, with more than three-quarters of councils saying they saw a need for extra primary school places within the next three years.

Half said they would need additional places in secondary schools. 

In the North East, where Central First School is located, more than 80 schools are overcrowded. 

The Local Government Association has also warned that schools will have to find places for almost one million more children in the next decade because of the population boom. 

It said council taxpayers alone could not absorb the £12billion cost of an extra 900,000 primary and secondary places needed – and accused the Government of failing to make up the shortfall. 

Population projections suggest that the 7.14million children in England’s schools will rise above 8million by 2023.

The organisation has warned that councils need extra help with funding ‘before time runs out’ 

Mr Godfrey said more funding is needed for oversubscribed schools to either extend their classrooms or re-build from scratch.

'I think there has to be more funding,' he said. 'Especially now the Government introduced free education to two-year-olds from low income families.

'Schools are having to accommodate this quota without any investment from central Government in the existing buildings.'

There are nine primary schools in North Tyneside which currently have more pupils than the official capacity - 36 per cent of the total, or more than one in three.

There are also two secondary schools in the area which are over capacity.

In South Tyneside, 11 primary schools are over capacity, just under a quarter of the total, as well as two secondary schools.

Mr Godfrey (pictured with some of his pupils) said schools are having to accommodate additional children 'without any investment from central Government in the existing buildings'

County Durham has 28 primary schools and five secondary schools which operating above capacity, while Newcastle has six overcrowded primary schools and two secondaries, and Northumberland has four primary schools operating above capacity. Figures for Sunderland were not available.

There have been ongoing concerns about pressure on school places, particularly for primary-age children, fuelled in part in recent years by a rising birth rate.

Councillor David Simmonds of the LGA said: ‘We fear a tipping point could soon emerge when councils and schools can no longer afford the massive costs for the creation of places, nor find the space necessary for new classes, if this crisis is not properly dealt with.

‘Additionally, councils face a challenge creating places on time and in the right places when their hands are tied by red tape.'

Around 90,000 places were created in 2012/13 by councils, and more are being established - but the scale of the problem is too big to be solved at a local level, the Association insisted.

Conservative Education Minister Nick Gibb said: 'This government has had to deal with an unprecedented increase in demand for school places. We have only been able to do this because of the tough decisions we have taken as part of our long-term economic plan to get the economy back on track.

'As a result, we have protected the school budget from cuts, invested an extra £5 billion to create new school places and spent £18 billion to improve school buildings across the country. Indeed, one of the first decisions we took in 2010 was to double the amount of money allocated to creating new school places.

'By contrast, the last Labour Government cut funding for school places during a baby boom while allowing immigration to get out of control, and wasted millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on their failed "Building Schools for the Future" programme.'

Labour claims the figures show a desperate need for more school places - and have accused the Government of pumping money into new free schools at the expense of existing schools.

Free schools were introduced by the Coalition government and are free from local council control.

Four out of five free schools opened last year did not fill all their places.

Responses to Freedom of Information requests, also filed by Labour, showed that 83 per cent of Free Schools that opened in 2014 had not filled all their places at the start of the first term.

Only seven of the 16 new mainstream secondary Free Schools opened last year were full.

Tristram Hunt, Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, said: 'David Cameron is irresponsibly diverting millions away from children in areas with a shortage of school places in order to fund his pet project Free Schools programme in areas where there are already enough places.'
