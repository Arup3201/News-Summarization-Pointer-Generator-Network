A Florida man has been jailed for five years for letting his two children live in the same house as decaying human remains for weeks. 

Todd Christopher LaDuke has been found guilty of two counts of child neglect, a misdemeanor count of failing to report a dead body to a medical examiner and possession of a controlled substance.

Upon release the 39-year-old will be on probation for a further five years.

According to Wfmynews2.com on Halloween last year LaDuke and his girlfriend Nicole Scalise were arrested after a well-being check for Tiffany Kain, 33, revealed her remains had been decaying inside their Holly Hill, Volusia County, home for up to three weeks.

Kain suffered from spina bifida and multiple sclerosis. 

Prosecutors said the couple had been living across the hall from Kain's body along with two children, aged six and 11, in 'deplorable conditions'. 

Court documents revealed the house 'was in total disarray, piles of animal feces and hoards of garbage were everywhere'.

According to reports the couple had clear knowledge of the obvious odour and were living without water and illegally obtaining electricity by bypassing their meter. 

Scalise was convicted of similar charges earlier this year and was sentenced to three years in prison followed by probation.

Scalise and LaDuke had admitted to being drug users, reportedly using narcotic painkillers without prescriptions. They also allegedly confessed to using Kain's Social Security card to buy things.  

The Department of Children and Families took custody of the children.
