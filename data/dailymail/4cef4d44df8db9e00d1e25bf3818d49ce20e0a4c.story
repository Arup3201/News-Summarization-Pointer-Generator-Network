Hamdi Ulukaya came to the U.S. with just $3,000 in his pocket and in the last five years has created a billion dollar business

To those who say the American Dream no longer exists, consider the story of Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish Kurd who came to the U.S. with $3,000 in his pocket and has in the last five years created a billion dollar business.

Ulukaya, 41, is the man behind Chobani, a runaway success story which has become the leading Greek yogurt brand in the U.S. with annual sales of more than $1 billion.

In a short space of time Ulukaya has taken an idea based on food that his parents used to make back in Turkey and turned into a one of the fastest growing brands in the country.

The company currently employs about 
3,000 people around the world, user 40 million pounds of domestically 
produced milk per week, and has helped turn an economically depressed 
region of upstate New York into a capital of Greek yogurt production.

One
of seven brothers, Ulukaya came to the U.S. in 1994 to study and learn 
English. He came from Ilic, a small town in the Kurdish region of 
Anatolia, 400 miles east of Ankara, where his family had tended sheep 
and made cheese and yogurt.

He studies took him to SUNY Albany, in upstate New York, where the rolling hills reminded him of home.

After
an assignment to write an essay about making something, he wrote about 
making feta cheese as his father did back in Turkey.

When his father visited he complained
about the quality of the feta cheese his son bought and told him he 
could make better himself.

In five years Chobani has become the leading Greek yogurt brand in the U.S. with annual sales of more than $1 billion

In
2002 Ulukaya started Euphrates, which continues to make cow’s milk feta
and sell it to wholesalers. The process of setting up a business was a 
steep learning curve but he learned quickly and after several years of 
struggling had established a small scale operation.

‘What
you brought wasn’t the money or the clothes, you brought what you 
learned from your culture. Mine was learning from my father how he dealt
with the business, and the products which he loved,’ he told The Daily 
Beast.

In 2005, he 
took the bold decision to take out a loan and buy a rundown 85-year-old 
yogurt plant in New Berlin that Kraft was selling for several hundred 
thousand dollars.

For his new venture he once again looked to the foods he knew from his childhood and decided to create a strained yogurt.

For decades, Pepsico, Coca-Cola, General Mills, and Kraft had pushed processed, sugary, unhealthy yogurts into stores because they thought that was what American palates demanded.

Capacity at the Chobani plant in New Berlin, New York state has grown from about 55,000 cases per week to nearly two million

But with another brand of strained 
yogurt - Fage - proving a success at specialty stores, Ulukaya felt the 
time was right for something different.

In
September 2007, after two years of testing he was finally ready to go 
to market with Chobani, which means shepherd in Turkish.

Part
of the yogurts subsequent success has been due to making the product 
thicker but without adding sugar – a bold decision consisting American 
tastes.

Fortunately for Ulukaya his timing was also good as his product, offers a lot of protein without much cholesterol or carbs, appealed to health conscious consumers.

Another factor in Chobani's success has been down to Ulukaya's business acumen as he insisted it should be placed in the main dairy area in supermarkets, rather than in the area for specialty and natural products.

Chobani started as a coastal phenomenon - spreading from the New York area to the Eastern Seaboard before gaining traction in the Midwest and West.

Capacity at the New Berlin plant has grown from about 55,000 cases per week to nearly two million.

In December 2012, a new $450 million plant - twice the size of the New Berlin plant - opened in Twin Falls, Idaho, a town of 44,000 about 130 miles southeast of Boise.
