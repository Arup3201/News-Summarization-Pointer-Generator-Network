Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev boasted to his friend, Azamat Tayazhakov, that he could make a bomb from gunpowder just one month before the terror attacks on the city's marathon, federal prosecutors said on Monday.

Assistant US Attorney Stephanie Siegmann also said that Tsarnaev, then aged 19, told Tayazhakov and another friend, Dias Kadyrbayev, that it would be good to die as a martyr and 'go straight to heaven'.

These damning claims were made on the first day of the trial of three University of Massachusetts students who are accused of interfering with the investigation into the bombing for one reason — to help Tsarnaev.

Azamat Tazhayakov is accused, along with his roommate, of removing a backpack, fireworks that had been emptied of their black powder and a laptop computer from Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth several days after the bombing.

Siegmann also said that Tazhayakov got a text from Tsarnaev one and a half hours after the bombing which killed three and injured almost 300 that said, 'Don't go thinking it's me.'

Going on, the prosecutor said that they will reveal other text messages between Tayazhakov and Dias Kadyrbayev that show the two knew it was Dzhokhar and his 25-year-old brother Tamerlan who had committed the bombings four hours before the FBI revealed their names publicly.

Indeed, the alleged crimes that the two men committed date from three days after the attack on the marathon, on the evening of Thursday, April 18, 2013.

Only hours before the FBI had released pictures of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan and had asked for the public's help in identifying the two men.

Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev, both 20 and from Kazakhstan, are accused of rushing to Dzhokhar Tamerlan's dormitory room and removing his backpack which contained fireworks emptied of gunpowder and his laptop.

They allegedly threw the bag behind a dumpster in a New Bedford apartment that they shared according to The Boston Globe.

The two men were brought into custody by the FBI and during questioning admitted were the backpack was.

The two men face obstruction of justice charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Also accused: Tazhayakov has pleaded not guilty to obstruction of justice and conspiracy charges. He and his roommate, Dias Kadyrbayev, (pictured) went to Tsarnaev's University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth dorm room several days after the bombing and removed a backpack, fireworks that had been emptied of their black powder and a laptop computer, prosecutors say

The lawyer for a man charged with obstructing the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombing denied on Monday that his client removed a laptop and backpack containing fireworks from the bombing suspect's dorm room three days after the deadly attack.

Defense attorney Nicholas Wooldridge said in his opening statement that Azamat Tazhayakov took nothing except a pair of headphones that were his property when he went to the room of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of helping his brother in the April 15, 2013, blasts.

Tazhayakov is the first of three of Tsarnaev's friends to face trial for hampering the investigation of the bombing and Wooldridge said it was his friend and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias Kadyrbayev who took the laptop from the room and dropped it in a dumpster.

Kadyrbayev is awaiting trial later this year on similar charges.

Prosecutors contend that Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev removed items from Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth at his request after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, as suspects in the bombing, which killed three people and injured 264.

'Dias is the one that took that bag back to the apartment, not Azamat,' Wooldridge said. 'Azamat never touched that bag.'

Neither man is charged with a role in the bombing. But prosecutors contended Tazhayakov believed Tsarnaev was the bomber when he went to his dorm room on the night of April 18, 2013.

'When they removed all these things, the defendant thought that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Siegmann said in an opening statement.

'The defendant and his roommate took all these steps, removing evidence, hiding evidence ... for one reason, one reason: to protect their close friend, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.'

Tazhayakov, 20, could face 25 years in prison if convicted of charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy. He has pleaded not guilty.

Tazhayakov was dressed in a black suit and tie and did not speak at the start of his trial in U.S. District Court in Boston.

Authorities said his actions delayed the arrest of Tsarnaev, who is also charged with killing a police officer at about the time the three friends were in his room.

Tsarnaev is accused of working with his now-dead brother to place two bombs near the finish line of the 2013 marathon, killing three people and injured more than 260. His trial is scheduled for November

Prosecutors said Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev and a third friend, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, recognized Tsarnaev as one of the suspects in photos the FBI released after the blasts, which were the largest mass casualty attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001.

They contacted Tsarnaev, who asked them to go to his dorm room and take anything they wanted. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, tried to leave Boston that night, with Tamerlan dying after a gun battle with police.

Tsarnaev, 20, is awaiting trial on charges that carry the death penalty if he is convicted.

Phillipos faces the lesser charge of lying to investigators.

Wooldridge urged the jury to remember that Tazhayakov is charged only with obstruction and conspiracy and not focus on emotional reactions to the attack.

'What is this case about? Well I’ll tell you what it’s not about: The bombing,' Wooldridge said. 'Don’t get shocked and awed. Stay clear and stay focused.'
