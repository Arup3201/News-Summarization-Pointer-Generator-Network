Michael O'Leary said Boris Johnson's plan for a Thames Estuary airport was 'insane, stupid and hare-brained'

Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary kept his language uncharacteristically clean when he told MPs that  the ‘Boris Island’ airport plan was worthy only of language that would be ‘unsuitable’ in Parliament.

But pushed by MPs to explain further, he said London Mayor Boris Johnson’s plan for a Thames Estuary airport was ‘insane, stupid and hare-brained’ as well as being ‘insanely and asininely stupid.’

Ryanair chief executive Mr O'Leary was giving evidence to the House of Commons Transport Select Committee.

Mr O'Leary erupted when asked for his thoughts about a new airport in the Thames Estuary - a scheme favoured by London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Mr O'Leary initially replied that his views of such a plan would involve language unsuitable in Parliament.

He added: ‘Such a scheme is insane, stupid and hare-brained. To try to come up with a new green-field site plan with no infrastructure and no motorway or rail links and which would take the rest of my life to build is insanely and asininely stupid.’

Mr O'Leary said it made more sense to expand at airports where there were was infrastructure already. He was keen to see more runway capacity in south-east England to help reverse the downturn in passenger numbers in recent years – including new runways at each of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.

This would ‘allow more (overseas) visitors and would grow tourism and grow jobs’.

He told the committee he could not join those who welcomed the Whitehall-ordered aviation commission, chaired by former Financial Services Authority boss Sir Howard Davies, which is due to present its final report into airport expansion options to the Government in summer 2015.

Insanely and asininely stupid: Mr O'Leary said that airports with existing infrastructure should be expanded

Mr O'Leary said: 'It (the commission) is just another example of kicking the aviation strategy can further down the road.'

He said the Government could make a decision on aviation policy ‘by 7pm tonight and we could do away with two years of deliberation’.

There was some parliamentary knock-about when Mr O'Leary said passengers flocked to Ryanair, which was now carrying 80million passengers a year.

To laughter, the committee's chairman Louise Ellman (Lab, Liverpool Riverside) replied: ‘They may flock to you but I am not sure they love you.’

Big idea: Boris Johnson backs the idea to have a new airport in the Thames Estuary

Mr O'Leary told MPs Ryanair could have grown passenger numbers more in the UK but had chosen to take more business overseas due to the 'uncompetitive APD (air passenger duty airport departure tax) and uncompetitive airport charges'.

He said APD should be scrapped and he reiterated his long-held views about the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), saying the authority had been 'a complete disaster' in regulating the aviation industry and 'did not know much about air transport at all'.

Asked if he recognised that MPs had to take many things into account when supporting new runways, Mr O'Leary said: ‘Do you pander to the noisy, militant few or do you make reasonable decisions in favour of the many?

‘One of the downsides of being an MP is that you are called upon to make sensible, long-term economic decisions."

Simon Buck chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA) told MPs that UK aviation has suffered from decades of non-decision-making, an airline trade association chief told MPs.

He said it was vital that politicians of all parties accept the recommendations of the Davies Commission which is charged with outlining aviation policy.

Mr Buck said: ‘We have had 30 to 40 years of decisions (on aviation) being put off or not made.’

He said: ‘The commission findings must be accepted by all political parties.’

Non-acceptance and the need for further reviews would be the 'worst possible thing' for UK aviation.

Mr O'Leary claimed, to some laughter, that passengers were flocking to Ryanair, which is now carrying 80million passengers a year

Virgin Atlantic government and external relations general manager Sian Foster said her airline was looking for the commission to come up with recommendations for a single hub airport for the UK.

But easyJet UK director Paul Simmons told the MPs that most UK airport passenger movements were not at a hub airport.
