She ran last year's London Marathon in what appeared to be full make-up, diamond earrings and designer sunglasses.

And now Katherine Jenkins, 33, has hit back at the 'women-hating women' who criticised her for her glamorous look.

'I'm not one of those girls. If I see a 
girl look nice, I'll tell her. I'm all for supporting other women being 
successful. I thought this was really sad,' says the mezzo-soprano in a new interview.

'We trained 
for six months and raised £30,000. We trained through the winter. I had 
to do a three-and-a-half hour run in the snow one day.

'It 
demeans anyone who has ever run a marathon because, believe me, I can 
think of better ways to get publicity than putting in all that hard work
 to run 26.2 miles.

'I had mascara on, but there was no eye shadow, no 
face make-up, no lip gloss. In any case there's no way that you could 
have eye shadow on and lip gloss and run for five hours and it's still 
there, not a chance,' Jenkins said speaking to the Sunday Telegraph's Seven magazine.

She ran the marathon in five and a half hours raising £30,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support. Her father, Selwyn, died of cancer when she was 15.

The Welsh singer was also immaculately coiffed for the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon

The Welsh singer, who turn 34 next month, was also immaculately coiffed for the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon in London in October.

She appeared to be sporting black eyelash extensions, a hint of eyeshadow and a slick of pink lip gloss for photo calls before and after embarking on the 13.1 mile circuit.

But while some have raised an eyebrow at Jenkins' attention to appearance, others have jumped to her defence.

Former TOWIE star Amy Childs, 22, who also ran the marathon, said Katherine looked beautiful, and admitted that she too opted for a made-up look.

Speaking 
on Loose Women the red-head said: 'Katherine Jenkins is absolutely 
beautiful. At the end of the race she looked beautiful as well.'

'Every
 morning at half 5 me running down Brentwood, Ongar, Pilgrims Hatch, I 
had no makeup on. No one would have recognised me, I had no makeup on 
but that was me waking up in the morning.

'For
 the marathon I thought no I am going to be glam, this is me, I love my 
eyelashes, I love being glam, so I did, so I ran glamorous, a guy ran 
past me and said 'God Amy how do you look like that!' I was sweating hot
 but I still had my lipgloss in my bag. I ran glamorous.'

Amy Childs said:'Katherine Jenkins is absolutely beautiful. At the end of the race she looked beautiful as well'

Jenkins was awarded a prestigious OBE at Buckingham Palace in March.

And the classical-crossover star has even more reason to celebrate after announcing her engagement to distinguished professor, artist and film-maker Andrew Levitas, 36, last month.

Speaking about the recent proposal, a source close to Katherine said: 
‘Andrew proposed in the Hamptons at his family home on Tuesday. It has 
been a whirlwind romance but both families are absolutely thrilled.’

The
 couple reportedly plan to marry in 2015 and are likely to have the 
ceremony in Wales, where Miss Jenkins’ family lives, followed by a small
 service in America, where Mr Levitas was born.

Jenkins
 looked remarkably conservative when she was spotted in central London 
on Thursday. The chart-topper was visiting the Radio 2 studios for work,
 but couldn't resist flashing her engagement to onlookers.
