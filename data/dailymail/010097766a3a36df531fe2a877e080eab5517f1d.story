A new lock screen bypass has left Apple iOS 7 users facing another security flaw.

The bug gives anyone with physical access to an iOS 7 iPhone or iPad the ability to skip the default authentication screen, in just five seconds.

This isn’t the first time the lock screen security on iOS has been compromised, but this particular hack does require specific settings in order to work.

A new lock screen bypass has left Apple iOS 7 users facing a security flaw. The bug gives anyone with access to an iOS 7 iPhone or iPad the ability to skip the default authentication screen in five seconds. The method only provides access to any app that was running in the foreground before the device was locked

For instance, the method only provides access to any app that was running in the foreground before the device was locked.

It also only works if a user has access to the Control Center enabled from the lock screen.

To gain access, users first need to have a missed call in Notification Center and access to Control Center from the lock screen.

They can then launch any app and lock the device. The next step is to wake the device and pull up Control Center, placing the device in Airplane Mode.

Until Apple fixes the flaw, the best defence available is to disable Control Center access on the lock screen

Users can then pull down notification bar, and tap on the missed call. They should now have access to the app that was running in the foreground before the device was locked.

Vancouver-based YouTuber EverythingApplePro claims to have found the flaw in in two hours and has posted a video demonstrating the process.

The method doesn’t allow full access to an iOS 7 device, but depending on the app running, different levels of privacy can be breached.

Apple is yet to provide a comment the security flaw. 

According 9 to 5 Mac, the method has so far been tested and confirmed on iOS 7.0.6 and 7.1.1. However, it does not apply to iOS 8 beta 1.

Until Apple fixes the flaw, the best defence available is to disable Control Center access on the lock screen.
