Miley Cyrus has literally twerked her way to the top.

Despite a public shunning from her risque MTV Video Music Awards performance with Robin Thicke in August, scandalous stage antics have been credited with earning the pop starlet $76.5million in 2013, according to Parade’s annual salary survey, What People Earn.

Downloads of her single Wrecking Ball shot up 124 percent following the outlandish appearance, allowing the song to sell more than three million copies in the U.S. alone.

The former Disney pin-up's earnings do not include any of the revenue she is set to earn from her international Bangerz tour, which is her fourth concert series.

Cyrus; 2013 earnings to not bring into account the revenue of her worldwide concert tour Bangers, which launched in America in February and is set to make her millions

Big deal: Writer-producer-director Tyler Perry is expect to top the list of 2013 earners, garnering $78 million for his work at the Oprah Winfrey Network

The tour only kicked in February in America and will move to Europe in May.

While Cyrus' banking is impressive, it's hardly the most money she has been able to make.

In 2011, at the age of 18, she was named #1 on Top 10 Richest Teens in Hollywood, with a net worth of $120 million.

Numerous other celebrities made it onto the magazine's annual list, which will officially be released on Sunday.

Super-producer Tyler Perry made an estimated $78 million for his work with the Oprah Winfrey Network, providing OWN with three television series that he penned himself.

The most successful is soap opera ratings smash The Haves and the Haves Nots.

Meanwhile, on the back on the success of comedy The Heat and action -drama Gravity -  among the top 15 highest-grossing in the U.S. in 2013 - Sandra Bullock made an estimated $63 million.

However the actress recently denied reports she was set to be paid $70 million from Gravity alone, saying that was 'news to me'.

Also providing box office gold was Thor actor Chris Hemsworth, who made a reported $58 million.

Beyonce, 32, came close managing  to bring home $57 million following the surprise release of her fifth studio album, Beyonce, featuring the single Drunk In Love.

Despite no promotion - fans were not told of the record's existence until it was avaiable, complete with music videos for every track - it became the fast-selling album ever on ITunes following its release on December 13.

She sold one million digital copies in six days and became the first woman ever to have her first five studio albums debut at number one.

Bruno Mars also made the listl bringing a home a cool $38 million.

While
 Mars was not paid for his Super Bowl performance, sales of his album, 
Unorthodox Jukebox, jumped 164 percent the following week.

Pepsi and Hyundai also licensed his songs for commercials.

While not making as much as Miley Cyrus, Beyonce still managed to bring home the bacon in 2013, banking $57 million thanks to the surprise release of her self-titled fifth album in December, while Bruno Mars (right) made $38 million

Vice President Joe Biden, 71, was also included in the list, however his earnings were not the same league as the featured celebrities.

Biden made $230,000 in 2013.

He was received $29,761 in Social Security benefits in 2012.

However there are other perks to Biden's job.

He enjoyed a ski holiday with his family in Aspen earlier this year that cost taxpayers $115,777.61.

The vice presidential family's security detail spent $92,596 on lodging, $17,866.61 on car rentals and $5,315 on flights.

Comparatively, Parade adds, the first Veep, John Adams, received a $5,000 salary in 1789.

Mathew McConaughey made $19 million, while US Vice President Joe Biden made $230,000

Rounding out the list was actor Matthew McConaughey, who is thought to have made $19 million.

The prolific actor underwent a career reinvention last year, thanks to his Oscar-winning turn in Dallas Buyers Club and critically acclaimed role in HBO series True Detective.

McConaughey's upfront fee for Dallas Buyers Club was $200,000.

It went on to make over $33 million at the international box office.
