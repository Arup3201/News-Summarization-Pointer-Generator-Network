Australian billionaire James Packer came to blows with his TV boss best friend in the street because he believed a camera crew was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr, it has emerged.

David Gyngell, 47, had gone to the casino owner's $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure him after an alleged exchange of heated text messages.

But the pair immediately became embroiled in a profanity-laced argument which descended into blows.

Explosive pictures showed 46-year-old Packer and a bearded, bare-foot Gyngell pummeling each other repeatedly before being pulled apart by a bodyguard.

Gyngell can be heard shouting: 'I didn't even know you were in f***ing Australia,' in video footage of the punch-up, reports The Daily Telegraph.

Packer's face was scarlet with rage and some images showed his neck veins bulging. He was left with a bruised right eye and a a swollen left cheekbone.

'They were beating the hell out of each other — fists were flying,' said photographer Brendan Beirne, who had been tailing the billionaire in the hope of getting a picture of him with Kerr.

'It just exploded. I've covered riots before, but nothing like this involving two such wealthy and high-profile people,' he said.

Casino boss: James Packer has been friends with Gyngell for 35 years

This morning a grim-faced but clean-shaven Gyngell paid a brief visit to Packer's mutli-million dollar home in Bondi, Sydney, which was the scene of yesterday's fight.

A short time later the pair, who have known each other since childhood, issued a joint statement downplaying the incident.

'We have been friends for 35 years and still are,' it read. 'In that time we have had our fair share of ups and downs. We respect each other and neither of us will be commenting further.'

Karl Stefanovic, who initially played down the impromtu fight, was seen leaving Packer's home on Monday evening.

He insisted to the MailOnline that the two friends had since made up.

'I think they've resolved their differences, it's all good, the lads are all good,' he said.

'I think Gyng and James are as good as they can be, they're good mates, they'll get through it.'

Asked if the two regretted their now infamous afternoon scuffle, Stefanovic said: 'I'll leave that up to them to talk about...I'm just there to support them.'

The TV star was put in an awkward position as mediator between the media supremos, due to his close friendship with James Packer and the fact Nine boss David Gyngell pays his wage.

Packer has been bunkered down in his huge Bondi Beach mansion for nearly 36 hours since he came to blows with his childhood mate.

Throughout the day he has had deliveries of vegetables, streaky bacon and pizza brought to the door.

Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan, a former business associate of Packer's also visited the house today.

He emerged from the mansion at 2.25pm to a waiting chauffeur driven limousine but refused to answer questions about what Murdoch's News Ltd had paid the fight photographs, which reportedly went for a six figure amount with some estimates  going as high as $210,000.

Packer fury: James Packer is said to have erupted in fury because he believed a television van from David Gyngell's Nine Network was in his street trying to capture images of Miranda Kerr (pictured above in Sydney this week with son, Flynn) visiting the casino mogul with whom she is rumoured to be romantically involved

Packer and Gyngell are understood to have fallen out after the casino boss split from his wife of six years Erica Baxter, who is mother of his three children. Unconfirmed rumours of a relationship with Kerr are said to have caused further strain between the pair.

The Victoria's Secret model, who broke up with actor Orlando Bloom last year, arrived in Sydney in the weekend. This seems to have prompted Packer's fear that he was being followed by a film crew. 

Gyngell, the head of Nine Entertainment Group, turned up at the house just after 2pm on Sunday to tell his friend that the van actually belonged to an on-call television staffer who just happened to live in the street.

'Packer basically told [Gyngell] to remove his f***ing truck from his street,' claimed a source.

Gyngell had come straight from surfing and was barefoot. The board was still strapped to the roof rack of his white Audi SUV, which he parked on the driveway while he waited around 20 minutes for Packer to arrive. He came straight from Sydney Airport where he had flown in on his private jet.

Witnesses said the pair squared up to one another and then exchanged a string of blows before tumbling to the footpath.

Packer's bodyguard finally forcibly separated by grasping the billionaire around the chin from behind and pulling him away.

One of the men was heard saying: 'Leave it James, just leave it.'

Gyngell, who was best man at Packer's wedding, looked stunned and off kilter, before leaving the scene. A doctor visited the house a short time later.

Witness Chris Walker tweeted that both men went 'toe to toe' in 'a big street fight', each landing heavy punches. The men wrestled for five minutes on the pavement.

Empathy: Lachlan Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has known both James a Packer and David Gyngell for many years and can empathise with Packer about the pressures of being a media heir

'Packer packed a punch but copped a couple of hits straight to the jaw... Then they all fell on the concrete fence and I think the other guy broke his face ... They were looking for teeth after he left,' Walker said on Twitter.

Packer, now an international casino mogul, and Gyngell, were boyhood friends whose fathers started the television industry in Australia.

David Gyngell's father Bruce was the first man on Australian television. Kerry Packer, James's late father started the Nine Network which David Gyngell now heads up.

Gyngell Snr, who died in 2000, is credited with creating the 'sofa format' of breakfast television in the UK, and rescuing TV-am in the 1980s.

He injected chatty presentation, cheery weather forecasts, breaking the so-called 'rules' of television and risking the cold shoulder of the British television establishment.

A ruthless cost cutter, but outwardly charming, he became Margaret Thatcher's favourite broadcasting executive when she was prime minister.

Kerry, the father of James Packer, was Australia's richest man before he died in 2005. He established Australia's most dominant television network, Channel Nine, and a magazine empire, Australian Consolidated Press.

Kerry Packer was one of Australia's most influential men - with an abrasive personality, fantastic wealth, and an expensive gambling habit - who became involved in legendary clashes with the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian media.

Outside Australia, Packer was best known for founding World Series Cricket, which he did in defiance of the staunch opposition of the British cricketing establishment.

James Packer appears to have inherited some of his father's love of verbal confrontation. In 2008, James confronted David Leckie, one of Channel Nine's former longtime executives, who had defected to rival station Seven, and told him to 'f*** off' and challenged him to a more physical encounter, saying, 'You want to go outside now? Let’s do it'.

Packer also tore strips off a female News Corp gossip columnist for an alleged item she had written about his private life, swearing at her and thrusting his hands in her face.

When his father was being treated at a New York Hospital for kidney failure, James came outside and told waiting media to 'f*** off'.

Following his father's death, James Packer began divesting himself of the Packer media interests, including the Nine Network and the magazine empire, in favour of international gaming assets.

James Packer's worldwide gambling empire, Crown, owns Crown Aspinall’s in London, and casinos in Melbourne, Perth, Macau and Las Vegas.

Packer, who has been married twice, split from his second wife Erica Baxter in 2013 after six years together. Mrs Packer now lives in Los Angeles with their three children, Indigo, 5, Jackson, 4, and 18-month-old Emmanuelle.

David Gyngell and his wife, television presenter Leila McKinnon, are expecting their second child.
