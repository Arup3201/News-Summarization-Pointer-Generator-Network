Disgraced former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers has refused to accept responsibility for his fall from grace and insisted he's 'the victim'.

The Reverend, who presided over the bank's near collapse, told friends he blamed the death of his mother and the pressure of his top banking job for turning to cocaine and rent boys.

Flowers - who has since been dubbed the Crystal Methodist - also claimed he was the victim of a 'nasty sting' and a 'witch-hunt'.

The 63-year-old's Labour-supporting lawyer Andy Hollas told The Sun: 'He feels he has been the victim of a rather nasty sting operation.

'He's been emotionally vulnerable for some 18 months - since the death of his mother, Muriel. He's a very moral man and he feels let down by the people he trusted.'

Flowers' mother died of cancer and he is said to have claimed to have cared for her while buckling under the pressure of his top banking job.

His defence was revealed as further sex and drugs allegations emerged against the former Bradford councillor.

Flowers, who was summoned by Parliament after the bank's near collapse with £700million losses, was last week quizzed then bailed by police probing alleged drug offences.

They swooped after seeing a video of him allegedly buying drugs in Leeds. The footage had already led to his suspension from the Methodist church and Labour Party.

Now new reports have emerged that Flowers, who stepped down as bank chairman in June, was spending 'vast' sums every week.

They swooped after seeing a video of him allegedly buying drugs in Leeds. The footage had already led to his suspension from the Methodist church and Labour Party.

Even after his secret drug taking was made public and he apologised, he appears to have kept up a stream of texts to his dealer ­referring to 'Charlie' (cocaine), 'ket' ­(ketamine), and crack cocaine.

He also bragged about having two bottles of date-rape drug GHB, lusting after a 17-year-old 'straight' boy and talked of going 'dogging'.
