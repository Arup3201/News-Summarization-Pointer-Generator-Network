A passenger may lose his eye after being hit with a hammer by an Uber cab driver.

Roberto Chicas,  35, a San Francisco bartender, was attacked 23 September at Ellsworth and Alemany Boulevard and left unconscious on the sidewalk. 

Doctors are unsure if he will lose sight in his right eye and he now faces facial reconstructive surgeries.

The driver of the car, Patrick Karajah,Karajah, 26, has been was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and battery with serious bodily injury, and has pleaded not guilty. 

Chicas's attorney Harry Stern said his client had just finished having drinks following a night of work when he called the cab, reports the San Francisco Gate.

Stern said the trouble began when Karajah took the freeway rather than city streets to get to Chicas' home. 

'When the passengers asked the driver why he was taking that route, he became agitated, stopping twice to try to force them out of the car, Stern said.

'The female passenger really tried to placate the driver and calm everybody down, but the driver just got more and more agitated and finally snapped,' Stern said.

Doctors are unsure if he will lose sight in his right eye and he now faces facial reconstructive surgeries. Pictured: Chicas, left, before the attack and right in hospital

He said Karajah pulled over in front of a public housing complex at Ellsworth Street and Alemany Boulevard, and told the three friends to get out.

'For reasons that are unknown at this point, he then snapped and smashed Roberto on the side of the head with a claw hammer,' Stern said. 

Karajah's attorney did not return calls seeking comment.

District Attorney George Gascon said Karajah has no criminal background, Gascon said and is currently free on $125,000 bail, reports San Francisco CBS.

Gascon has sent letters to ridesharing companies about possible violations of state and local laws including misleading information about driver background checks, reports ABC7 News.

'It's not like I'm against the business model. I support anything that creates innovation and provides improvement for the consumer, we just have to balance it out with customer protection,' Gascon said.

In a statement Uber  said:' We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care. It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following any serious allegations, which we have done'. Pictured: The Uber phone app

Gascon said the companies are not following procedures that would keep them safe, such as background checks, saying he has evidence that people with significant criminal records are driving for some of these services.

In a statement sent to KPIX 5, Uber spokesperson Eva Behrend said:

'Safety is Uber's #1 priority. We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care. It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following any serious allegations, which we have done. We stand ready to assist authorities in any investigation.'

'Rider safety is Uber’s #1 priority. We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care.' 

This message from ride-sharing company Uber was seen when a D.C. driver was accused of sexually assaulting a sleeping passenger.

It was also seen when an Atlanta driver allegedly pulled a gun on a valet. And when an Orlando driver reportedly touched a rider under her blouse.

Buzzfeed published a collection of statements the company released in the wake of eight incidents where drivers were accused of bad behavior or were involved in a crash.  

The announcements seem to follow a boilerplate formula, beginning with the representative talking about rider safety being Uber's priority, saying the company will respond with the 'utmost urgency and care.'

In certain instances, the spokesperson will say they are suspending the driver or saying Uber is ready to aid investigators, as they did when an Alabama driver was found with weed and an open bottle of vodka in his vehicle. 

According to a blog post on Uber's site, their policy is to conduct background checks on drivers that include looking at criminal history going back seven years. 

Recently the company has faced criticism over rider safety.

The Chronicle reported that the district attorneys of San Francisco and Los Angeles called some practices of Uber and two other ride-sharing companies a 'continuing threat to consumers.'

Uber has not responded for comment as of yet.
