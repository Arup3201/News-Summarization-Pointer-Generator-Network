Significant concern has been caused by a series of threats from al Qaeda-linked groups to attack America and Europe, it has been reported.

Officials are thought to be studying the threats, which have evolved over the past six months and are determining the strength of al Qaeda in several different countries including Yemen, Pakistan and Syria, although none have been corroborated.

U.S. officials had believed that the terrorist organisation was focusing on planning attacks outside of the United States due to the difficulty in breaching homeland security.

Members of Ansar al-Sharia, an al Qaeda-affiliated group, are seen near a tank in the southern Yemeni town of Jaar last month. It is thought groups in the country could be planning attacks in the United States and Europe

However CNN has reported that the new threats suggest there could be plans to target sites within America and Europe.

They reported that a senior U.S. official said that 'we do not see operational cells of al Qaeda inside the United States' but emphasised this could not be ruled out.

It is thought that the source of the threats comes from three separate regions including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula based in Yemen.

The U.S. considers Yemen's local al Qaeda branch as the terror group's most dangerous offshoot worldwide.Â 

It is blamed for a number of unsuccessful
 bomb plots aimed at Americans, including an attempt to bring down a 
U.S.-bound airliner with explosives hidden in the bomber's underwear and
 a second plot to send mail bombs hidden in the toner cartridges on 
planes headed to the U.S.

The U.S. embassy in Sanaa shut down its premises this month as a precaution against possible retaliatory attacks and is set to remain closed for several more days.

A core group from the organisation is also thought to be operating in Pakistan and another official has told CNN that they could be looking to place operatives to attack U.S. targets both in America and abroad.

Meanwhile there is also worry that a third terrorist threat comes from Syria where it is believed more than 70 Americans have travelled to fight in the conflict there.

The Treasury Department has already levied sanctions on two individuals suspected of supporting al-Qaeda in Syria.

The two individuals are known informally as al-Juhni and al-Qaduli. They are suspected of handling a range of duties, including arranging payments, passing messages, providing intelligence and arranging meetings for al Qaeda.
