Andrew Fuller changed his name to avoid detection

A greedy property developer who conned a bank out of millions of pounds to fund a lavish lifestyle has been jailed.

Andrew Fuller, 46, was imprisoned for six years and three months after pleading guilty to fraud and forgery.

He also admitted possessing a passport under a false name - which he obtained in a bid to evade justice.

Maidstone Crown Court heard Fuller's scam started after he bought a property in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in late 2002, with a view to converting it into 19 luxury flats.

In 2005 he secured a £5.7 million loan from a bank, claiming he would use the money to develop the site, known locally as Kingswood Birches.

It was agreed with the bank that repayment would be made only once sales of the proposed flats had been completed.

In late 2007, the first three apartments were completed and were sold for about £350,000 each, reducing the debt owed by Fuller to £5.3million.

The remaining 16 properties were completed in 2008, but due to the economic downturn, Fuller was unable to sell the flats.

Fuller was told by the bank which loaned him the money that he must not let any of the properties out to tenants, as the apartments would lose value on the open market.

But ignoring the bank's instructions, Fuller started to rent out some of the flats and rather than using the income to pay back the loan, he pocketed it.

The rent he received was used to fund extravagant shopping trips, luxury hotel stays in Knightsbridge, London, and holidays abroad.

By May 2009, the bank was having problems contacting Fuller. All his mail was being returned to the bank, stating he had 'gone away'.

Further checks revealed that by July 2009 the majority of the remaining flats at Kingswood Birches had been sold without the bank's knowledge.

Fuller, who had fled to the Far East, had sold the properties and not used the proceeds, about £3.137 million, to pay back his loan.

Fuller was eventually arrested by police in December 2012 at an address in Bath, Somerset.

In interview, he accepted full responsibility and also admitted changing his name by Deed Poll and obtaining a passport in the name of Andrew Templar to avoid arrest.

Sentencing Fuller, Judge Jeremy Carey told him: 'This fraud is about as serious as any that comes before the court because of the value, in excess of £3.5million, and your actions in the way the money was dissipated.

'The offence was pure greed on your part.'

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Adrian Brown, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'My team worked hard to sift through the deception and deceit created by Fuller who decided that once he could not afford to pay back the bank he was going to live the high life of a successful businessman which he clearly was not.'
