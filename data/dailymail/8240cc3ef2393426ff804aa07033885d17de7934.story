Given the sense of crisis once again engulfing Rangers, it could be tempting to view this on-field revival as a template for how to cure their wider worries. If only things were that simple.

A change of personnel and direction, enforced by some bold decision-making, dragged the Ibrox side away from a defeat that would have been deeply damaging even at this early stage of the season.

How the Rangers fans who witnessed it must wish the deepening financial concerns could be eased in a similarly swift and decisive way. They are well aware, however, that substituting investors and directors is nowhere near as easy as changing players on the pitch.

Protest: Rangers fans chanted 'sack the board' despite Saturday's win 

Ally McCoist’s half-time introduction of Ian Black and, in particular, David Templeton transformed Rangers’ fortunes and enabled them to hit three second period goals without response.

It was a victory that provided cheer on another day of discord. Confirmation that the club is attempting to raise £4million from a share issue just to keep the lights on brought a new wave of anger towards those currently in power.

A red card protest was staged in the Broomloan Road stand after 18 and 72 minutes, the first of those accompanied by a ‘Sack the Board’ chant that gained echoes in other areas of the stadium. One protestor held up a banner stating ‘No more faceless investors’ just behind the directors’ box.

Further ire was generated when the club declined to state the intentions of chief executive Graham Wallace over a contractual bonus worth up to £315,000.

It was revealed in May that Wallace could effectively double his salary in cash or shares by the end of August if certain performance requirements were met.

A spokesperson confirmed Wallace had not yet received a bonus but refused to comment further when asked to clarify if it could happen at a future date.

It would surely be absurd if any bonuses were taken, given the perilous position Rangers once again find themselves in. But if the past few years at Ibrox have taught us anything, it is that absurdity is no barrier to the possible becoming reality.

Off-field issues will dominate in the weeks ahead, yet that does not diminish the importance of events between the white lines. Yesterday evening, McCoist praised his players for maintaining focus amid the supporter protests and general air of turmoil that surrounds the club.

More of the same will be required given the hugely impressive start Hearts have made with four successive wins in the Championship. Promotion at the first attempt is a cornerstone of Rangers’ recovery, regardless of who is populating the boardroom, and it clearly isn’t going to be a straightforward task.

Tricky encounter: Iain Russell gives Queen of the South the lead for a second time 

Kenny Miller came off the bench to net the clinching fourth goal for McCoist’s men at the weekend and carries the kind of experience that could prove vital over a tense campaign not short on distractions.

The former Scotland striker is adamant everyone in the Rangers dressing room is braced for a lengthy scrap, but with full confidence of coming out on top.

‘We never thought it would be a gimme,’ insisted Miller. ‘We are favourites and I think rightly so.

‘I have always said that come May we will win the league. There is no doubt about it.

‘But Hearts, Hibs and this game against Queen of the South have shown that no-one is going to make it easy for us.

‘We are not going to be handed it and we are going to have to earn it. We are going to have work and play better.

‘We are only four games in so you can’t narrow it down to ourselves and Hearts. I thought Hibs were fantastic when they played us in the Petrofac Training Cup.

‘They will be there or thereabouts as well and I think Queen of the South have started great.

‘Yes, we beat them but I thought they can be proud about coming here and playing the way they played especially in that first half.

‘It is definitely not a gimme because it is going to be long and hard. But with the quality we have in that dressing room, we firmly believe that come May we will be at the top.’

To do so, Rangers recognise they will have to improve upon the dismal quality of defending shown in the opening period.

Queens took the lead after 22 minutes when Daniel Carmichael galloped into space on the right and delivered a low cross for Gavin Reilly. He had the freedom required to take a touch before clipping a shot beyond Steve Simonsen.

Rangers levelled via a looping header from Marius Zaliukas – although visiting manager Jim McIntyre felt goalkeeper Zander Clark was fouled on the line by Bilel Mohsni – but were behind again after 36 minutes.

Zaliukas was woeful as he let Reilly in behind him to square for Iain Russell. Again, there was zero pressure on the finisher as he stuck the ball into the bottom corner.

It prompted a double switch at the break, with Zaliukas and the utterly ineffective Arnold Peralta replaced by Black and Templeton.

The latter took barely a minute to justify his inclusion. Capitalising on a slip from Kevin Holt, Templeton cut inside along the edge of the area and dispatched a tremendous left-foot drive into the net.

It was precisely what Rangers needed to lift them from their torpor and a reminder of the talent Templeton possesses. Sadly for the former Hearts winger, an ankle injury forced his replacement five minutes from the end.

Mohnsi then atoned for some of his earlier defending by meeting a Nicky Law corner with a diving header that squirmed its way beyond Clark to put his side in front for the first time.

Queens – missing seven players through injury - couldn’t muster the same threat as in the opening period and Miller sealed the result within 60 seconds of replacing Templeton.

Latching onto a head flick from Boyd, he scampered through to dink over Clark for the first competitive goal of his third stint at Rangers.
