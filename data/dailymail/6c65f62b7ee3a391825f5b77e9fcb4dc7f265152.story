John Stiles, 53, who was killed in a fall while hiking in the Russian mountains

The body of a British charity worker lay undiscovered in the Russian mountains for eight months after he plunged to his death during a hiking trip, an inquest heard.

Father-of-two John Stiles had been working in Grozny, in the Chechen Republic, to help rehouse displaced Chechen refugees.

His body  was found beneath Severny peak in the Tepli mountain range in North Ossetia - a peak he had tried to climb just two weeks prior to his death but the attempt was called off due to poor weather.

Mr Stiles is thought to have fallen 'a substantial distance' to his death during the hike in November 2013. But bad weather meant his body was not found until the following July. 

Mr Stiles, who worked as a director with the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) in Grozny, regularly went to North Ossetia to hike during his two year stay in Chechnya, the hearing in Bradford was told. 

The 53-year-old from Ilkley, west Yorkshire, was dropped off at the base of the 3,800ft peak by his driver at 8am on November 2013, but failed to return at the agreed pick-up time of 6pm

The charity programme director, who previously worked for Save The Children UK, had met his wife, Isabelle, while they were both working in north Iraq in 1994.

The inquest was told that Mr Stiles became quite 'lonely' in Chechnya, where the DRC was based, and took to the mountain region of Tepli to go hiking at the weekends.  

Mr Stiles had come home to visit his wife and their two children, Poppy and Hugo, in August 2013 before travelling back to Russia a month later.

 'When he returned to Russia in September I am sure he was thinking he did not exercise much that summer or did not have a sporty time,' said Mrs Stiles

'He decided to plan a few trips on weekends before the snow and winter. He did try to hike. He tried the peak that he eventually died on, two weeks before his death. He texted our daughter about not succeeding because of the weather. 

'John loved being outdoors in the mountains and could not have spent two years in the country without trying to walk them.

'He had good judgement and he was very sensible. I trusted his judgement and felt he was responsible in his adventures. He would not take risks to be a hero. He had massive respect for his staff and would not be late for his driver.' 

A rescue team was sent out to find Mr Stiles but due to poor weather and fears of avalanche it was called off. The rescue was resumed on 17th July and his body was found the next day.

Investigators in Russia said there was no third party involvement and a post-mortem revealed that the cause of death was most likely a fall from a significant height.

Hospital surgery notes from 15 years ago were matched with a post mortem x-ray to confirm the body found in the remote Russian Caucasus mountains were his. 

The inquest heard that Mr Stiles, who had a degree in International Development from York University, was set to bring the programme he was working on in Grozny to an end in October 2014 and close the offices.

Mrs Stiles said: 'It was a difficult task but he was very good at it. He was perfect for this. DRC had been there 15 years since the first war with Russia.'

The DRC provided help and assistance to Chechen families displaced by the wars with Russia on housing, legal aid and income generation projects, she said.

 His body was found was found beneath Severny peak in the Tepli mountain range in North Ossetia

She added: 'John was extremely diplomatic, calm and friendly. He had a respect of culture and religion. I have never met anyone who fell out with him.

'He was supposed to come back and do his best to find a job in the UK, probably a charity headquarters in London.

'We have two young teenagers and we both decided he was needed at home.'

The keen mountain walker, who had been on many trip with his wife and children, had discovered a love of the outdoors after joining the Scouts as a young boy in his home of Croydon.

He later came to teach others and as well as being a dedicated scout leader in his youth volunteered for the 1st Ben Rhydding Scout Group later in life.

The inquest was told he and a friend set up a company called High Adventure and took groups hiking to Pakistan.

His career had seen him undertake humanitarian aid projects in North Iraq, where he met his wife through their work for the Kurds who had been displaced by Saddam Hussein's regime. 

Coroner Martin Fleming recorded a conclusion of 'accidental death' saying: 'I heard he was very much committed to his charity work. He was a much loved father and deeply missed by all who had the pleasure to know him. I have heard he was DRC director before his death and worked in Chechnya for some two years. I have noted he was a experienced fell and mountain walker with some thirty years-experience.

'It was thought he was going up the Severny peak which it 3,800 metres above sea level. The weather was good and clear. The search became hampered by snow fall and the risk of avalanche. The search was abandoned. On 17th July the search was resumed when the weather had cleared and during the search the body was found under the peak of Severny.

'Other people would benefit from his experience when he would take people off to see how it is done. He was a fit and healthy man. It is significant that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

'I feel it is more likely than not that Mr Stiles lost his footing and fell to his traffic death. This must have been very hard for you and the family to bear. I would ask you to take away my sincerest sympathies at this very sad time for you.'
