Following England’s 2-1 defeat to Uruguay last night, there is expected to be a 50 per cent surge in site searches over this weekend, as devastated fans look to alleviate their disappointment by booking a holiday.

With progression to the next round almost out of England’s reach and holiday prices discounted as the World Cup led to limited demand, England supporters are expected to cut their losses and rush to book the remaining deals before prices return to their normal value. 

The World Cup has had an impact on the UK travel industry this year as patriotic holidaymakers chose to put-off their holiday plans in fear they’d miss out on the celebrations if England were to progress to the later stages of the tournament.

Grief: Booking a holiday may be the perfect tonic for England supporters this summer

Typically one of the busiest periods, bookings in June have been lower than normal causing the industry to offer deals to fill flights and accommodation during the peak holiday season.  

Holiday comparison site TravelSupermarket has also found that 13.6 per cent of consumers admitted their holiday plans were influenced by the World Cup, with six per cent of poll respondents claiming they’re now planning a trip to Brazil.

Furthermore, holiday searches to the host nation were up 43 per cent compared to the previous week as the England team arrived in the country.

Get me out of here: TravelSupermarket are expecting a surge in holiday bookings after England's defeat to Uruguay

Bob 
Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket comments: 'When England has
 a vested interest in something like the World Cup, it’s natural for 
holidays to take a back seat.

'A
 slow booking period followed by a sudden surge in activity is a trend 
we see time and time again. However, when there is more supply than 
demand, prices drop.

'England
 fans deserve to be cheered up this summer, that’s why we’re encouraging
 them to seize the opportunity and book their getaway while there are 
still deals to be had.

'English football fans can still score a good holiday deal, even if their national team can’t score on the pitch.”
