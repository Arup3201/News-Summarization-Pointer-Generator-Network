A motorcyclist suffered a pierced scrotum when the force of a crash forced his broken thigh bone into his genitalia.

The 33-year-old was admitted to Ulm University Hospital in Germany with a 'hard, swollen, bluish scrotum and an externally rotated and slightly shortened left leg'.

Medics treating him ordered a CT scan to get a better picture of the man's injuries.

And it revealed a surprising diagnosis. The top of his left thigh bone, the femur, had been sheared off by the force of the collision.

The impact had also caused the broken bone to pierce his scrotum from the inside.

The man also suffered open fractures of his right forearm and hand, the New England Journal of Medicine report reveals. 

Specialists  operated on the 33-year-old using a 'direct scrotal incision' procedure to fix the bones back in place.

The doctors treating the man said he had no 'urologic sequelae' - bladder and urinary dysfunction, despite his horrific injuries. 

After eight weeks of limited weight bearing, the patient was able to walk using a cane.

And at a follow-up appointment 14 months after the crash, a CT scan revealed the bone structures in the man's leg were fully recovered and he was able to walk without the aid of the cane.
