Music legends the Gallagher brothers and Johnny Marr joined in the scenes of wild celebration as Manchester City clinched their second Premier League title.

The Oasis and Smiths legends were at the Etihad Stadium to see their team cruise to an easy 2-0 victory against West Ham.

Before the game, Noel Gallagher admitted he was feeling more nerves than he had before the match that clinched the title two years ago against QPR, saying: 'My stomach was going this morning.'

Noel and Liam Gallagher arrived at the game separately and did not sit together during the match.

Noel took part in the mass pitch invasion following the game along with Johnny Marr and was even given the captain's armband by Vincent Kompany. 

Oasis split in August 2009 after Noel and Liam had a massive backstage row in Paris.

Last month, Liam sparked rumours of a possible reunion after a series of cryptic Twitter posts, but so far fans of the Britpop act have been disappointed.

Noel even turned down the possibility of a £20 million payday by rejecting a lucrative world tour.

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was photographed lifting the Barclays Premier League trophy without his armband after he handed it to Noel Gallagher.

The former Oasis man was spotted proudly pointing to the armband on the pitch after the game.

He was strolling on the pitch with Johnny Marr, casually talking to fellow Manchester City fans - apart from brother Liam.

While just 36 miles away Liverpool fans 
again suffered heartbreak on the final day of the  season as they failed
 to win their first league title since 1990.

Liverpool needed to beat Newcastle at Anfield while hoping Manchester City would lose to West Ham at the Etihad stadium in Manchester.

All Premier League games kicked-off at exactly 3pm today in a bid to keep some drama in the title race.

Liverpool fans at Anfield prayed to the heavens for an unlikely sign that they could win their first ever Premier League title.

But the only thing in the skies over Merseyside was an aircraft sent by Manchester United fans mocking Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard over his lack of league titles.

Cruel Manchester City fans also thanked Steven Gerrard for his slip at Chelsea which cost Liverpool a vital game, followed by an unlikely draw against Crystal Palace when the Merseyside team were three goals up with 20 minutes left in the game.

While Manchester City fans decided Steven Gerrard should be reminded of his unfortunate slip against Chelsea which derailed his league dreams

After dropping those five points, Manchester City started today's game knowing that all they needed to do was avoid defeat and they would be crowned champions.

Fans in Anfield and Manchester had portable radios to keep track of the score in the other game. When word reached Manchester that Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel had scored an own-goal, the stadium erupted.

Minutes later, Manchester City scored, leaving Liverpool an impossible task. Even two late Liverpool goals were too late as City were cruising to an easy 2-0 victory.

Manchester City fans also invaded the pitch at Loftus Road in 2012 after their first league title win in Premier League history.

One of their fans managed to take the match ball home with him, although he was later arrested by police.

The club decided against pressing charges against the 17-year-old youth on condition he returned the ball.

Already, according to bookmakers Paddy Power, Manchester City are the 15/8 favourite to defend their league title, with Chelsea at 9/4 with Liverpool trailing at 5/1.

Manchester United are 6/1 to regain the championship while Arsene Wenger's Arsenal are 9/1. Crystal Palace, who derailed Liveropool's league bid this year are 10,000/1 to win next season's league.
