Action: A Libyan soldier in training. Three stationed at a barracks in Cambridgeshire were detained after breaking orders not to go to the local supermarket

They are being trained to defeat violent militia and restore order to a war-ravaged country – but Libyan troops at a UK base have staged a mutiny fighting for a more British freedom: the right to go to Tesco.

The uprising kicked off when three North African soldiers stationed at barracks in Cambridgeshire were detained after breaking orders not to go to the village supermarket.

And it became a full-on mutiny when up to 20 of their comrades stormed the area where they were being kept to demand their release.

The British corporal in charge of the guardroom was jostled and shouted at during the angry confrontation and eventually defused the situation by releasing the Tesco Three, who had earlier been picked up by police after leaving the barracks without permission.

They are among more than 300 Libyan cadets who are being trained in infantry and leadership skills  by soldiers from 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland at Bassingbourn Barracks.

But under rules agreed by the MoD and the 4,000 residents of the village, trainees are allowed to leave the base only on organised tourist trips.

An Army source said: ‘Between 15 and 20 of the Libyans got wind of what had happened to their friends and felt they had a grievance. They made their way to the guardroom and remonstrated with the soldiers.

‘It got a bit heated and the corporal in charge showed remarkable restraint in the face of considerable intimidation. He eventually decided to de-escalate the situation and everyone was let out of the guardroom.’

No weapons were involved in the stand-off, which happened a month ago but has only now come to light. About 30 cadets, including some of those involved in the fracas, have left the course early and returned home.

The MoD confirmed a disturbance and said: ‘This behaviour was unacceptable and steps have been taken to investigate the reasons behind  it. Appropriate action was taken against some of those involved. All recruits have been reminded of the standards of behaviour we expect.’

According to British military sources, the miscreants were disciplined by Libyan officials but it  is not known what penalties were imposed. Some recruits have also been unhappy about delays to their pay and allowances, over which the  British Army has no control.

Britain is training about 2,000 Libyan troops, with the aim of them returning home and ‘supporting Libya’s transition to a stable and open democracy’, in the words of Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.
