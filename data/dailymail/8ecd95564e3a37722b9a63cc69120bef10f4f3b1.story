Toulon will attempt to lure Danny Cipriani to France next season if the fly-half is left out of England’s Six Nations squad in the new year.

According to reports in Midi Olympique — the French publication often used as a mouthpiece by Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal — the Top 14 side want to bring in the Sale No 10 after missing out on All Blacks icon Dan Carter.

Cipriani is out of contract in the summer and Sportsmail understands that he could be tempted by a move to the south of France if he is overlooked at England’s squad announcement next month.

Negotiations are ongoing with Sale, and the 27-year-old has been in fine form for the high-flying Manchester club, prompting calls for the playmaker to be given an international recall after missing out on the autumn Test series.

The player’s agent, Oliver Ward, told Sportsmail that no discussions have yet been held with Toulon, contrary to reports that a visit to the club’s facilities has already been agreed for early next year.

‘The rugby agents in France are more akin to football agents here, so I’m sure there are a few touting his name around,’ said Ward. ‘As far as we’re concerned, there has been no official contact with Toulon and talks are advancing really well with Sale.’

Cipriani  is Sale’s top earner on £250,000 per year, but French clubs have considerably more spending power. Last week, Racing Metro outbid Toulon to sign Carter on an annual salary of more than £1million.

The prospect of working under Jonny Wilkinson would no doubt appeal to Cipriani, who would be viewed as a direct replacement for the out-of-contract Nicolas Sanchez and James O’Connor.

Cipriani’s high-profile personality would be a perfect fit for Boudjellal’s galactico vision. The tycoon has already signed All Black midfielder Ma’a Nonu, saying that ‘he’s a great centre and he’s got great looks. At Toulon, we love this’. Harlequins, too, have been linked with a move for Cipriani, but the London club have already signed Australian James Horwill as a marquee player and Kiwi No 10 Nick Evans still has one year remaining on his £320,000 contract.

No formal negotiation can be made until January 1 under Premiership Rugby regulations, but overseas-based players can be approached, with Bath yesterday completing a deal for Fiji scrum-half Nikola Matawalu.

But Leicester were dealt a double blow as Welsh targets Liam Williams and Justin Tipuric both extended their deals with the Scarlets and the Ospreys.

Williams revealed on Twitter: ‘Pleased to announce I have signed for @scarlets_rugby for another two years! #WestIsBest #KeepingTheDreamAlive’.
