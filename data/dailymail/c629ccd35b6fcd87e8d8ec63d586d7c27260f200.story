Pop singer Simone Battle died Friday morning, at her home in Los Angeles, MailOnline has confirmed.

The 25-year-old G.R.L. group singer and former X Factor contestant was found dead around 8am, her father Anthony E Battle told MailOnline. 

'She will be greatly missed and loved,' Mr Battle said. 'She was an exuberant person and a very loved person.' 

He says the death is still under investigation, but law enforcement sources told TMZ it was an apparent suicide.

Today, Battle's record company and management issued a joint statement on her passing.

'We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Simone Battle of G.R.L.' the statement from Reign Deer Entertainment, Kemosabe Records, RCA Records and Pussycat Dolls founder Robin Antin reads.

'Simone was an exceptional young talent and human being, and we are all devastated to learn of her passing. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and loved ones at this time.'

Friend and fellow-musician Derek Butler initially broke the news overnight on Instagram. 

Butler posted a picture of Battle and wrote:  'I'm, still in shock and in disbelief to have confirmed the death of my childhood friend.

'Her heart was pure gold and her star power limitless. Rest in sweet peace Angel.'  

At the time of her death, Battle was singing in the girl group G.R.L. which was initially organized as a re-boot of The Pussycat Dolls group.
