For some reason, the World Cup makes managers do the strangest things. Perhaps it is the pressure of football at the elite level.

Anyone with a passing knowledge of England’s head coach Roy Hodgson would describe this genial man as a naturally conservative and cautious manager.

He has built a 40-year coaching career off the back of it and you will do well to find anyone with a better working knowledge of the game’s tactics and systems. Whatever blows your hair back.

Hodgson has been in charge of England for 29 games and drawn 10, if you include the lop-sided 0-0 draw with Italy at Euro 2012.

England knew who they were appointing when they offered him the top job after Fabio Capello limply walked away two years ago.

Based on Hodgson's behavioural patterns over the years, he is not a guy who would instinctively jeopardise his team’s chances in the opening game of a World Cup in Brazil.

We are unlikely to be back here in our lifetime and yet, last Saturday, he abandoned the principles that have served him so well and risked it all against Cesare Prandelli’s side. England are playing catch-up.

In a varied coaching career, Hodgson is known throughout the world for getting the best out of limited resources. He is a pragmatist - that’s what he does and he does it well.

His training ground methodology, which involves endless drills and work on positional play, is legendary among his players.

When a mistake is made, it is not unknown for Hodgson to take the ball right back to the very beginning.

Repetition built his reputation.

These, undoubtedly, are the tools that got him the England job in the first place.

In recent times Hodgson succeeded with West Brom and took Fulham on a magical run to the Europa League final against Atletico Madrid.

At Liverpool, where the history of the club means the demands are very different, he was sacked after only six months in charge.

In World Cup conditions, the sense of alarm and panic about every petty little detail is heightened. The stakes are raised.

For some reason, with a defence that everybody knows is suspect at the very highest level, Hodgson tried to blow Italy away in the opening game.

The question is, what possessed him?

We now know, after assistant manager Gary Neville’s illuminating interview with 5 Live on Monday evening, that Hodgson abandoned his naturally cautious approach.

The reality is that a draw, particularly after Costa Rica’s surprise 3-1 victory over Uruguay earlier in the day, would have done just fine.

There was no pressure to beat the four time world champions in the opening game, none at all.

His team selection, with Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck playing just behind the goalscoring threat of Daniel Sturridge, felt like life or death.

At one point during the 2-1 defeat in Manaus, Neville turned to England’s goalkeeper coach Dave Watson and compared the strategy to a World Cup quarter-final. It was boom or bust.

Neville went on to praise England’s head coach for being bold and brave and introducing the element of risk. The reality is that Hodgson risked it all.

No-one can remember Hodgson, who is a solid, dependable and reliable man, being quite so gung-ho throughout his entire coaching career.

James Milner, who has just won his second Barclays Premier League title with Manchester City, has been completely frozen out.

This is a player with pedigree, a recent history of success and a man who finished the season strong with City.

Arguably he was Manuel Pellegrini’s best player in the title run-in.

After the game on Saturday night, Hodgson spoke of working hard on the training ground ahead of the clash with Uruguay to rectify some defensive frailties.

The truth is that there is no time. England’s players were conditioned at their Portugal and Miami training camps during an intensive build up to the tournament.

That’s when the hard work, the tactical preparation and organisation, was meant to be done. Here in Brazil it is too late.

After a warm down day following a four-hour flight back to Rio from Manaus on Sunday, England’s players were put through a light session on Monday.

On Tuesday there was some heavy duty tactical work based on the assumption that Luis Suarez will start alongside Paris Saint-Germain forward Edinson Cavani in the Arena Sao Paulo.

Suarez’s presence is another example of Hodgson deviating from an accepted practice under intense, sometimes intolerable tournament pressures.

On a whiteboard after England drew with Honduras at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami, the players were told not to talk about individual Italian players, namely Andrea Pirlo. They followed their instructions.

A few days later, when Hodgson appeared drained in the mixed zone at the Arena Amazonia, he was asked whether Suarez was a genuine world class player.

Hodgson responded by challenging the Liverpool striker to prove it, which can only have increased the Uruguayan’s motivation when he faces five of his club team-mates on Thursday.

England cannot afford to lose this game and Hodgson knows that he has put himself in a tight spot at this tournament.

Finding a way out of it will be some achievement.
