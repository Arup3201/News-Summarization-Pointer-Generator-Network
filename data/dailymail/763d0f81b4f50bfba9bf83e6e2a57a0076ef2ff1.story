Treat: Budget chain Lidl is to sell reindeer steaks for £7.99 a pack as part of a 'Deluxe' range to tempt middle-class shoppers

Thoughts of reindeer and Christmas normally evoke images of red-nosed Rudolph and Santa’s sleigh flying over snowy rooftops.

But Lidl has been accused by animal welfare groups of making a mockery of the Christmas season by putting Rudolph on the menu.

The
budget supermarket is making reindeer steaks central to a Christmas 
advertising push designed to attract middle-class shoppers.

The
steaks are part of its ‘Deluxe’ range that will feature in the 
company’s first multi- million pound TV advertising campaign in Britain.

Packs of frozen 
reindeer steaks, which are a seasonal treat in Scandinavian countries, 
will sell for £7.99 each, while other products include a whole cooked 
lobster for £5.99, a large serrano ham for £39.99, a three fish roast 
for £5.69 and caviar for £1.49 a pot.

The German-owned chain has sold the reindeer steaks before and insisted they are ‘back by popular demand’.

Lidl, like its budget rival Aldi, is 
making a concerted effort to attract middle and higher income shoppers 
by introducing luxury products at low prices.

Its television adverts will focus on the Deluxe range, which saw sales more 
than double between 2011 and 2012 to £40.2million in 2012.

It is looking
to rake in a further 50 per cent this year to some £63.8million.

They
will emphasise quality and luxury to a soundtrack that includes a cover
of the One Direction song ‘All these Little Things’ and voiceovers from
Harry Enfield.

Managing 
director, Ronny Gottschlich, says: ‘Our Deluxe products have proven to 
be our best-selling, along with our Comte de Brismand champagne, which 
speaks volumes for what our customers want.

‘We
feel now is the time to fully showcase the quality of these products 
with the vast expansion of the range and the addition of many new fresh 
British products.’

A
spokesman added: ‘The Deluxe Reindeer steaks are back by popular 
demand. We always have an enormously positive response from customers.

‘We
are selling them this Christmas as part of our premium range of 
products, which also includes other luxury meats such as venison, quail 
and partridge.

‘The animals are slaughtered in 
strict accordance with EU guidelines in a EU certified slaughterhouse, 
where the animals are stunned prior to the slaughtering process.

'We 
takes issues of animal welfare as well as environmental protection very 
seriously.’

Controversy: Animal welfare groups have accused the company of making a mockery of the Christmas season by putting Rudolph on the menu

But Justin 
Kerswell, of animal welfare and vegetarian group Viva!, said wild 
predators of reindeer, such as wolves and bears, are shot to protect 
meat supplies for retailers.

‘What Lidl aren’t telling their 
customers is that to put reindeer meat on British shelves other large 
wild animals are systematically hunted, or trapped, and shot,’ he said.

‘All
that seemingly matters to this cut-price supermarket is delivering sick
novelty and the pursuit of profit this Christmastime.’ 

Aldi
is today taking its battle to win over middle Britain to Suffolk where 
it will open its 500th store in the market town of Bury St Edmunds.

At the same time, the company published research from retail analysts Verdict showing the number of people using Aldi for their main weekly shop has leapt 31.7per cent in a year. 

Some 36.6per cent of shoppers who have switched came from Tesco, 19.7per cent from Asda, 16.9per cent from Morrisons and 12.7per cent from Sainsbury’s.

Almost one in five using the discounter are middle class or upper middle class, which is up from just one in eight a year ago.

Andrew Stevens, food and grocery specialist at Verdict, said: ‘Shoppers have switched to Aldi for price, but have stayed with the retailer due to the high quality of its products.’
