Kurt Fearnley is a man determined not to let one aspect of who he is define him.

Born with a congenital disorder which prevented the growth of his lower spine and sacrum, Fearnley has spent his life doing exactly what he believes he should be doing- living life to the full.

‘You always have the ability within to live your life, pushing the limits,' the three-time Paralympic Gold medallist told Daily Mail Australia. 

'If you learn to accept yourself you can't just accept bits and pieces. I couldn't imagine my life any other way. Disability is just another aspect of a person.'

‘You always have the ability within to live your life, pushing the limits,' the three-time Paralympic Gold medalist told Daily Mail Australia

‘If I were offered the chance to walk tomorrow I would jump at it, but if it meant losing the person I have become I would not swap it in a million years,' Fearnley said

‘People have this idea that struggling is a bad thing, but struggling is brilliant. If you see someone struggle and overcome it, it is infectious. It makes you feel good to be alive.’

From the man who has won has won the New York City wheelchair marathon five times,  sailed the Sydney to Hobart race, was recognised as the 2009 Young Australian of the Year, and was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia, this seems like advice from experience. 

‘If I were offered the chance to walk tomorrow I would jump at it, but if it meant losing the person I have become I would not swap it in a million years,' Fearnley said in his new memoir, Pushing the Limits.

'If I could choose between the reality of walking and the idea that I could achieve anything I set out to do, I would take the idea every time.’ 

In 2009, Fearnley took on a challenge that would make even the most hardened athlete balk- conquering the Kokoda Trail.

The ten-day hike is considered one of the most formidable treks in the world, along the unforgiving landscape of the Owen Stanley Range in Papua New Guinea's mountains and dense forest.

Fearnley decided that he would crawl the 96 kilometre trail, and set out to train himself mentally, physically and spiritually, and knowing that he would be in the company of his family and friends gave the preparation a focus

Despite this, Fearnley said that the thought that he wouldn't take on the test of endurance simply because of his disability never entered his mind. 

'I grew up with the idea that life can be hard. Deal with it. There's no way I would choose to live a life sitting on the sidelines. I'm here, I'm in it and I'm part of it. If I am remembered for anything I want to be remembered for this: I was prepared to grab hold of life and rip it to pieces.' 

The idea for the epic hike began among tragic circumstances, following the unexpected death of his cousin Pete in a car accident. 

The media-dubbed 'wheelchair marathon man' said that the idea bubbled away under the surface for a few months, but began to take shape when his brothers, many of his cousins, and five of his friends all committed to the idea as a way of reinforcing the bond between them which had resurfaced in the wake of Pete's death.

After reading a compelling account of a Victorian solider who had been shot in both ankles and dragged himself along the Kokoda Trail rather than make his fellow soldiers carry him, Fearnley was inspired, and his determination to tackle the track reinvigorated. 

He decided that he would crawl the 96 kilometre trail, and set out to train himself mentally, physically and spiritually, and knowing that he would be in the company of his family and friends gave the preparation a focus.

'Life's not about watching. It's about getting in there and getting your hands dirty and being a part of it,' Fearnley said

'We all have the ability to be who we want to be, and we have to choose that and choose it repeatedly, because going through hardship is not all about gold or joy,' Fearnley said

‘Our motivation was to be there together and to be there for each other. It was not about me trying to prove that I could crawl every metre of the way,' he wrote.

'It was not about me trying to prove anything. I didn’t need to drag myself bloody. This was not a competition or a race. If I, or any of us, needed to be helped or supported or carried for a while, we knew we had only to ask.’

On the eve of the hike, Fearnley and his fellow hikers were meeting some of the locals, when a man who had grown up on the trail but had broken his back told the Paralympian that in his culture, children with disabilities were hidden, or kept to the side of rooms, and not allowed to interact with the wider community. 

He told Fearnley, ‘While you’re crawling on the track you’re going to make people question that belief. Every person with a disability that’s being kept in those rooms, they’re going to be with you on the track. They’re going to be there on your shoulders.’

Fearnley said that the powerful assertion weighed heavily on him, and made him reassess the impact that his journey would have not only on himself, but on others who looked up to him and saw him as a beacon for change.

‘Right hang on, this has become much bigger than I ever intended, or ever imagined,' he said.

Throughout the gruelling journey, Fearnley found himself constantly bombarded by experiences and emotions he hadn't expected.

From his injuries sustained from crawling across mud-splattered ground and scattered debris, to developing an intimate bond with his PNG 'porters' who helped him scale some of the impenetrable track, Fearnley found himself acutely aware of, and even uncomfortable with, asking for assistance. 

‘Being a man who is so intent on being self-sufficient, it was disconcerting to feel that I genuinely needed help to continue and that there was nothing wrong with asking for it.’

However, following the trail which was haunted with the memories and sacrifices of the soldiers who had journeyed the distance, out of fear and necessity rather than willingly, was one of the most emotionally significant aspects of the trek.

The group reached Eora Creek, the site where more Australian casualties died in Papua New Guinea than any other, on Remembrance Day, which Fearnley said was a profoundly moving experience.  

‘We sat there visualising the conflict, and how surreal and mournful the experience must have been for those young soldiers almost seven decades earlier,' he said.

‘Many were brave and idealistic striplings laying down their lives in a strange and unforgiving land.’  

‘I have believed the constant hum in my ears telling me that I am powerful and that the world is my canvas, to colour as I see fit,' said Kurt

‘It made me think about the people who were calling me a hero for crawling the track. The heroes were the soldiers and the Fuzzy Wuzzies who had slogged it out in 1942. I was just a fella trying to get as much as I could out of life,' he said in his memoir.

Fearnley decidedly did exactly that on the Kokoda Trail, losing seven kilos from the sheer effort of pulling himself by his arms along the track.

Arriving at the end, he said that he and his travelling companions had achieved more than they thought they were capable of.

‘We felt like we had plunged to the worst lows and soared to the greatest heights, and now that we had endured it all, we felt indomitable. As though there was nothing, physically, mentally, or emotionally, that we could not endure.’

‘I have believed the constant hum in my ears telling me that I am powerful and that the world is my canvas, to colour as I see fit. At some point that feedback took hold, my world shifted, and I understood that disability would never be a weight and would never drag me down.'

For Fearnley, the battle to overcome Kokoda was significant, but certainly wasn't the only challenge he has faced in his life, nor will it be the last.

This is not something that daunts this man, who crawled Kokoda, who seeks to push himself, and who never wants himself, or anyone else with a disability, to be limited by an aspect that does not define them. 

'Life's not about watching. It's about getting in there and getting your hands dirty and being a part of it,' he said.

'That’s what I consider to be living. I was the beneficiaries of people who would stand up when I couldn’t, and if my story helps even one kid to have a better quality of life, that's amazing.'

'We all have the ability to be who we want to be, and we have to choose that and choose it repeatedly, because going through hardship is not all about gold or joy.'

'Life is about making it through the more shadowy moments and harder periods. That’s as much who you are as the other parts, and we should have as much pride attached to that as anything else.'
