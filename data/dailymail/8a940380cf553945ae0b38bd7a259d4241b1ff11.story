A former Los Angeles police detective has been sentenced to 27 years to life in prison for murdering the wife of her former lover in a jealous fit of rage 26 years ago.

Stephanie Lazarus, 52, was found guilty in March of killing Sherri Rasmussen, a nurse who was bludgeoned and shot to death in the condo she shared with her husband of three months, John Ruetten.

Rasmussen's mother, sister and widower spoke during the sentencing hearing about their pain and described the victim as a warm, caring and loving person.

Ruetten, visibly emotional, told the judge he still grieves.

'The fact that Sherri's death occurred because she met and married me, brings me to my knees,' he said. 'I do not know ... how to cope with this appalling fact.'

Superior Court Judge Robert Perry gave Lazarus a term of 25 years with the possibility of parole for first-degree murder and an additional two years for personal use of a firearm.

He said Lazarus would be credited with 1,608 days, or nearly 4 1/2 years, for good behavior and time already served.

Prosecutors said in a 'statement of views' that 'Lazarus misused her police training in the most profound way imaginable by utilizing that training and experience to commit murder and to cover up her crime.'

'Lazarus betrayed the trust placed in her by the Los Angeles Police Department and by people of Los Angeles in order to pursue her own murderous ends'

'Lazarus' profound narcissism led her to kill and continues to motivate her denial of responsibility,' the prosecution concluded.

Lazarus' defense attorney said an appeal has been filed.

Outside court, Lazarus' brother and mother said their hearts go out to Rasmussen's family, but they still support Lazarus and believe she did not get a fair trial.

'There was never a presumption of innocence,' said Steve Lazarus. 'The media got to listen to DNA and guilt for 2 1/2 years before Stephanie had her trial.'

During the trial, prosecutors focused on the romantic relationship between Lazarus and Ruetten after they graduated from college - claiming Lazarus was consumed with jealousy when Ruetten decided to marry Rasmussen instead of her.

The case hinged on DNA from a bite mark prosecutors say was left by Lazarus on Rasmussen's arm.

Her defense attorney countered that the 
DNA was packaged improperly and deteriorated while stored in a coroner's
freezer for two decades. He also suggested there might have been 
evidence tampering.

After a day and a half of deliberation, the jury of eight women and four men delivered its guilty decision on March 8.

Victim Sherri Rasmussen was bludgeoned and shot to death in 1986 in the condo she shared with her husband of three months.

Detectives initially believed two robbers who had attacked another woman in the area were to blame.

But two decades later, a cold case team using DNA analysis concluded the killer was a woman and authorities began looking at Lazarus as a suspect.

During the trial Ruetten testified that he never intended to 
marry Lazarus, although they were intimate for about a year. He also 
said she enticed him into having sex with her shortly before his 
wedding.

'Here's the deal,' he testified. 'It was clear she was very upset that I was getting married and moving on.'

Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, ridiculed the claim of a fatal attraction between Lazarus and Ruetten, saying she never tried to reunite with her former lover after his wife was gone.

'So this obsessing with John must have fizzled out I guess,' he said.

Shocking close-up death pictures of the 
battered face of Mrs Rasmussen were presented to jurors during the trial of 
Lazarus, showing one eye swollen shut and the other wide open.

Mrs Rasmussen's mouth was open wide, her 
hands held up as if in a defensive posture.

Lazarus went on to marry another 
policeman and adopt a daughter. She rose in the ranks of the Los Angeles
Police Department, becoming a detective in charge of art forgeries and 
thefts.

Overland also pointed to the lack of physical evidence against her. No blood, fingerprints, hair or fibers connected her to the scene.

But prosecutor Shannon Presby told jurors the case was based on more than just DNA. At the outset of the trial, he said it featured 'a bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart'.

He said a bite on Mrs Rasmussen's arm 
contained saliva that was matched to Lazarus's DNA more than two decades
after the killing.

Lazarus' gun was never found, but Mr Presby called experts to testify that bullets fired into Rasmussen's body matched those issued to police officers in 1986.

Mr Presby drove home the idea in his closing 
argument with a familiar line from poet William Congreve: 'Heaven has no
rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.'

Lazarus' husband attended most of the trial along with other family members.

Ruetten sat across the courtroom with Rasmussen's family.

The defendant and her white-haired former boyfriend never looked at each other.

But their past moved before them on screen as both sides showed pictures of them as a young couple.

Among the trial's most dramatic moments came when Ruetten testified tearfully about finding his wife slain. He said it never entered his mind that Lazarus might be responsible.Â 

It was the first time in living memory that an active-duty LAPD officer was arrested on a murder charge and later convicted, according to the Los Angeles Times.
