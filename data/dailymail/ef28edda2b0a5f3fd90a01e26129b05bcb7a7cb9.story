This campaign is set to tackle  the barriers that stop women being more active

A bold new campaign set to tackle head on the barriers that stop millions of women being more active has been launched today.

Led by Sport England, the This Girl Can campaign is the first of its kind to feature women of all shapes, sizes and sporting abilities that sweat and jiggle as they exercise. 

It seeks to tell the real story of women who exercise and play sport by using images that are the complete opposite of the idealised and stylised images of women we are now used to seeing.

The campaign doesn't hold back in trying to encourage women to defeat any fears surrounding activity.

'Sweating like a pig, feeling like a fox' and 'I kick balls, deal with it' are among the hard hitting lines used in the campaign to prompt a change in attitudes and help boost women's confidence.

This Girl Can will use prime time TV advertising, billboards and cinema and shopping centre screens to put images of real women exercising on the national stage and use social media to start a debate about attitudes to female sport.

It comes as research, carried out by Sport England, reveals that by every measure, fewer women than men play sport regularly - two million fewer 14 to 40 year olds in total. 

Despite this, 75 per cent say they want to be more active. In some other European countries, this disparity doesn't exist.

Further research into what's stopping women turning their ambitions into reality found that a fear of judgment - of their appearance, ability or how they choose to spend time on themselves - puts women of all ages off exercising.

The findings were the driving force behind the campaign's creation, which aims to empower women and encourage more to get active.

In particular, it celebrates women who have found their own ways of breaking down their barriers.

Grace Monksfield Hammond, 22, from London, features in a print advert with the slogan 'I'm slow but I'm lapping everyone on the couch'.

The full-time theatre arts student says: 'I have always been active, and now I incorporate exercise into my everyday life by cycling all over London whether that's to get to work, to go out in the evening, or wherever.

'I'm not an athlete, and I wouldn't describe myself as super fit - nor am I fast on my bike.

'When I first started cycling I didn't want to be taken seriously as I'm not an athlete, far from it, so I put flowers on my bike. 

'I get energy from cycling and it makes me feel free and confident.

'I think that comes from exercise generally, not just cycling, and because it's just part of my life, i don't even think of it as exercise any more.

'I feely admits that I might not be the fastest rider in the saddle, but I don't let that bother me.

'I hope This Girl Can encourages women not to worry about whether they're the fast enough or good enough - I don't let it worry me, and nor should they.'

Slogans like 'I kick balls. Deal with it.' aim to tackle the exercise gender gap, with two million men being more active than women

Sport England CEO Jennie Price said: 'The figures on participation are crystal clear. There is a significant gender gap, with two million more men than women exercising or playing sport regularly. 

'I believe we can tackle this gap, because our research shows that 75 per cent of women would like to do more.

'Before we began this campaign, we looked very carefully at what women were saying about why they felt sport and exercise was not for them. Some of the issues, like time and cost, were familiar, but one of the strongest themes was a fear of judgment. 

'Worries about being judged for being the wrong size, not fit enough and not skilled enough came up time and again. Every single woman I have talked to about this campaign - and that is now hundreds - has identified with this, and it is that fear of not being 'good enough' in some way, and the fear that you are the only one who feels like that, that we want to address.

'In This Girl Can we want to tell the real story of women who exercise and play sport. They come in all shapes and sizes and all levels of ability. They have a myriad of reasons for doing what they do. 

'If you are wondering if you should join them - or carry on - this campaign says it really doesn't matter if you are a bit rubbish or completely brilliant, the main thing is that you are a woman and you are doing something, and that deserves to be celebrated.'

The women featuring in the video campaign include Victoria, a 29-year-old paediatric nurse in A&E, from East London. 

While a lot of girls say that getting sweaty isn't feminine, Victoria isn't one of them. In fact, she is proud of getting hot, red faced and sweaty. 

She said: 'At first sweating may seem gross, but getting sweaty and red-faced shows your body's working hard and that's something to be proud of, not worry about. 

'You have to put your shoulders back and hold your head high when you leave the gym or finish a run because having a sweaty face shows you've achieved something. 

'It gives me more energy as well - I have to fit exercise around shift work because I'm a nurse and I often do a spin class before a night shift because it sets me up for what's ahead.'

Meanwhile Kelly, 31, is a single working mother  of three from Bury, near Manchester. 

She has found a distinct way to fit exercise into her life since she had her third child - by working out at home, with her children. 

Kelly said: 'After I had my third child I just felt sluggish, I didn't have any energy. I was due to go back to work and didn't feel good about myself and that gave me the kick-start I needed to find a way to prioritise getting active. I make exercise a family affair. My kids are part of the workout routine - we put on music or a DVD and just go for it together. 

'It doesn't feel like a pain to do it because it's fun, and part of our life, and I really hope it has a positive effect on how my children view exercise as they grow up, so being active won't feel like a chore, but just something they naturally do.'

Plans to launch the campaign were announced towards the end of 2014 and it is already resonating with thousands of women through social media. As part of the campaign, Sport England is working with sports bodies, local authorities and companies across England to make sure they're providing sporting opportunities that meet the needs of women inspired by the campaign.
