Being chased by a giant mutant spider is enough to send most people into a fit of terror.

So it's not surprising that this pooch caused quite a stir when she was let loose disguised as a terrifying eight-legged beast. 

Chica the DogSpider is the work of Polish prankster Sylwester Wardega, who dressed up his pooch in the fur-covered costume before releasing her on an unsuspecting public.

A hilarious video, which has had more than three million views on YouTube in just one day, shows the hairy creature lurking behind doorways, ready to pounce on its victims.

Innocent: Chica the dog is dressed up as a giant spider before being let loose on the unsuspecting public

Harmless: The terrifying pooch sets off to cause havoc on the streets of Poland at night

Deadly: Chica stands on top of a lifeless man in an elevator - waiting to pounce on its next victims

In one scene, a man taking out his garbage flees for his life when Chica emerges from behind a door, while in another, two girls scream and run after seeing the creature atop a lifeless man in an elevator.

Later in the video, a couple spot a flinching man wrapped up in a 'spider web' hanging from a tree in a park and the man bravely creeps towards it, while his girlfriend stays rooted in her position.

But his courage is quickly forgotten when DogSpider emerges from the shadows - and chases him right out of the park.

Viewers have to feel particularly sorry for one man in a train station, who comes across fake, bloody body parts hanging from more string webs.  

Terrifying: Two women who were waiting for the life run for their lives after seeing the prowling pooch

Spooked: The women are filmed running across a parking lot to escape the terrifying creature

He's behind you! Another passerby unwittingly gets trapped in a waiting web while trying to flee Chica

Fright: This man leaps in the air when coming face-to-face with DogSpider as he lurks in the dark

Run for it! Chica emerges from behind the door and scuttles towards the man as he takes off

Friend or foe? In the daytime, Chica looks adorable - but it's a very different story once night falls

He stops to take photographs of the limbs before the massive spider scurries behind him - forcing him to run off the platform and straight into a waiting web. He manages to escape just as DogSpider nears.

'This is funny as hell,' one YouTube viewer commented. 'My only hope is that the people pranked in this video will be whatever means find out that [it] isn't real. I mean, I'd be SCARRED for LIFE.'

A Facebook page has also been set up for the now popular pooch. 

Wardega has made other prank videos, including Spider Man - who hangs from subway carts, catches rides on the back of trains and sprays a 'web' at passersby.

But there are other creepy ones too, including a Slender Man figure that lurks in parks.
