Fears were growing last night that the Woolwich attack was carried out by a home-grown Islamic terror cell far bigger than originally estimated.

Over the weekend armed counter- terrorism officers arrested four young men within 24 hours on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

The dramatic daytime arrests by police wearing balaclavas means there are now six terror suspects being held over the death of Drummer Lee Rigby.

Police raided a flat in Greenwich where they arrested two men on suspicion of conspiracy to murder  

These include Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, who remain in hospital under arrest after executing Drummer Rigby, 25, last Wednesday.

Terrorism experts initially believed the attack to be the work of two ‘lone wolves’ who were not linked to any larger extremist group.

Comparisons were quickly made between the Woolwich attack and last month’s bombing of the Boston Marathon, which was carried out by two terrorists.

But the arrest of four more suspects raises the fear that a terror cell was operating in suburban houses in London.

There are also concerns that other Islamic extremists could be lurking in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

Peter Clarke, former head of counter terrorism at Scotland Yard, said that he believed Adebolajo and Adebowale were part of a bigger terror network.

‘Clearly these people this week weren’t lone wolves,’ he told Sky News. ‘We know that they associated with other people with a similar way of thinking and the thing is that underpinning everything they do, there is an ideology.

‘So when you are attacking a network, you are attacking an organisation or structure but when you’re looking at individuals, you have to understand how far they have been poisoned, how far their actions have been influenced by the pernicious ideology that violent extremism has.’

The potential existence of a terror cell may not have been spotted before because it did not plan a large attack like the failed airline bomb plots of 2006, experts said.

Yesterday armed officers wearing balaclavas arrested a man on a street in north London in connection with Drummer Rigby’s murder.

Witnesses said they leapt out of a silver car and a white van near Highbury Corner around 2.45pm.

The man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and last night was being questioned.

One witness, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘The guy was on a push bike when the police came out of nowhere and wrestled him to the ground.’

On Saturday afternoon armed officers in balaclavas leapt out of an unmarked van and raided a flat in Greenwich, south London.

They fired a Taser stun-gun at a 28-year-old man to subdue him before arresting him. They also arrested a man aged 24. In a street in nearby Charlton officers fired a Taser at a 21-year-old suspect.

All were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and remained in custody last night.Meanwhile detectives from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command were granted extra time to question Abu Nusaybah, 31, who was arrested at the BBC following an interview he did on the its Newsnight programme on Friday.

He was held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. The arrest was not directly linked to Drummer Rigby’s death.

On TV Nusaybah claimed Adebolajo had been approached by MI5 six months ago and asked to work for the security service.
