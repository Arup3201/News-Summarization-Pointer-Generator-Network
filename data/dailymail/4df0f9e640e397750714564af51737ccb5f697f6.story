Diamonds may be a girl's best friend – but they are not exactly kind to her wallet.

Unless she shops at Avon, that is. For the mail order make-up firm has launched a bargain diamond necklace that costs just £25.

The pendant is made of sterling silver with the gemstone set in the centre, and will be sold door-to-door by Avon representatives in the run up to Mother's Day.

The company hopes it will appeal to Britain's thrifty middle classes, who are increasingly happy to buy luxury goods such as smoked salmon and champagne at cut-price supermarkets Aldi and Lidl. 

On a budget: The silver and diamond necklace costs £25 from Avon

It follows the success of Avon's £30 diamond earrings, which sold out in just nine days after being launched last year.

Two pairs of earrings, which were encrusted with 32 tiny diamonds amounting to 0.2 carats, were sold each minute in the run up to Christmas.

And although Avon's latest necklace contains just 0.01 carats, the firm believes simply having the chance to buy a genuine precious stone for such a low price will be enough to appeal to customers.

'We are proud to invest in high-end items, such as diamonds, and make them accessible to all our deserving customers from the comfort of their homes,' said Anthony Wells, Avon's marketing executive.

'We are happy that mothers across the UK will be receiving this extra special gift.'

The company said all their diamonds were responsibly sourced from Africa, before being ethically cut and polished in India.

Around a third of UK women are Avon customers, and the firm sells more than 3.5billion products around the world each year.
