It is an unusual form of theatre, but one New Zealander has managed to gain international fame by wrapping his face in rubber bands.

Shay Horay, who is known by stage name Rubberband Boy, contorts his face by twisting rubberbands around his head.

The result is that he looks like a grotesque character from a horror movie, reported Oddity Central.

The 34-year-old says that he knew what he wanted to do from a very young age.

Knowing he wanted to perform from a young age, he used to play with rubberbands in his parents’ office supply shop, and used them to create characters inspired by cartoon Inspector Gadget.

He is able to perform stand-up comedy, unicycle and use a pogo stick, but it is his rubberband routine that makes him stand out.

Performer: Children love his unusual performances. He is also trained in stand up comedy, uni-cycling and pogo-stick

Mr Horay has travelled to 25 different countries performing the act.

He told the Otago Times: ‘It’s not, for me, about the money.

‘My job is making people laugh and allowing people to have a good time. Everyone needs a few extra laughs in their day.’

He currently holds the record of 78 rubber bands wrapped round his face.
