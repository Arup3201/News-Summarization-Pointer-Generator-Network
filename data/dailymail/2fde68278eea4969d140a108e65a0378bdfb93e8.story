A new television special will take a look at women behind bars, and the toll it has taken on them after years of incarceration.

In an episode of the Diane Sawyer program Hidden America set to air on ABC this Friday, the television journalist will take a look at these women in A Nation of Women Behind Bars.

For the special, Sawyer and team went to four prisons across the country over the course of eight months to see what’s wrong and what’s next with these women and the prison system.
