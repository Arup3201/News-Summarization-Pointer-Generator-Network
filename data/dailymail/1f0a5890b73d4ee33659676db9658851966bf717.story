Jamie Carragher has backed Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers' decision to rest Raheem Sterling because it can prevent the forward from 'being over played then breaking down'.

Rodgers left Sterling out of the squad that won 1-0 against Sunderland on Saturday, and the 20-year-old was absent when Liverpool beat AFC Wimbledon 2-1 in the FA Cup third round.

And Sportsmail columnist Carragher feels letting Sterling go on holiday to Jamaica was the right move to prevent the England international from burning out.

'Brendan Rodgers' decision to give Raheem Sterling a break abroad for the last two games certainly provided plenty of comment this morning,' Carragher wrote on Kicca.

'If the result at Sunderland [on Saturday] had gone the wrong way it would have been used as a stick to beat him with. Before the FA Cup game at Wimbledon Sterling had played more minutes this season than any other player in our league at 20, and the way he plays with plenty of high intensity runs means it will eventually take its toll. 

'The problem is he's Liverpool's most important player at the moment the same as Michael Owen was at that age and we know that contributed to him being over played then breaking down. 

'This is something that happened to [Cristiano] Ronaldo at Man United at that age and is the right decision, just thankfully for Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers we got the three points!!'
