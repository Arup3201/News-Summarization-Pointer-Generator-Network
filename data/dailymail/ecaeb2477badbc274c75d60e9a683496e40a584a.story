Incredible photographs chronicling breathtaking vistas and scenes from all over the world are to go on display in London later this month.

An exhibition showcasing the winning and shortlisted images from the third Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum International Photography Award (HIPA) will open at London's Royal Geographical Society in late September as part of a global tour.

It is the first time the awards have visited the UK. The theme of the competition this year is 'Beauty of Light'.

It was established in 2011 and is open to photographers of all abilities, with an overall prize fund of £248,000, making it the world's biggest photography prize.

It includes spectacular landscapes, intimate portraits and stunning black and white images by photographers from around the world.  The pictures incorporate shimmering deserts, Vietnamese fishermen, birds of prey and child monks.

The exhibition will also showcase the work of five British photographers.
