President Barack Obama's approval rating continued to spiral downward this month, reaching yet another record low in a new poll.

Just 40 percent of Americans praised Obama in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll while 54 percent said they were not happy with president.

Obama's previous low came immediately prior to today's numbers in the news organizations' June survey. In that poll, 41 percent of respondents said they approved of Obama 53 percent said they disapproved.

More bad news: President Barack Obama awoke this morning to another poll showing his approval ratings in the gutter as he entered into the third and final day of his US-Africa Leaders Summit

President Barack Obama's approval rating dropped to 40 percent this month - the lowest it's ever been. Americans haven't given the president an approval rating over 50 percent since he began his second term

Contributing
 to Americans' unhappiness with Obama is his attitude toward foreign 
affairs.

A mere 36 percent of survey-takers said they are pleased with his handling of foreign policy, a record low in and of itself. A 
majority, 60 percent, say they're not impressed with the way he's approached 
global issues.

Americans are still resentful of the economic downturn, as well. Less than three in 10 respondents told pollsters they were satisfied with 
the state of the economy.

And while Obama's favorability rating on the economy ticked up one 
percentage from June to 42 percent approval,Â  the president has not had an approval rating on this issue above 50 percent since his first year
 in office.

Whether international or domestic, more people said they were dissatisfied 
with the way the U.S. has handled every crisis, 
including the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the fighting 
between Israel and Hamas and the surge in Central American children 
crossing the border.

Americans are least satisfied with how the 
situation at the border has been handled, with only 11 percent saying they are content 
with the response so far.

Asked specifically about how the U.S. should handle the more than 57,000 immigrant children who have illegally entered the country in the last fiscal year, the majority of respondents - 51 percent - said 'we
 do not have the resources' to provide for the children and 'they should be returned 
immediately.' Meanwhile, 43 percent said the U.S. has a 'responsibility to
 look out for children who are fleeing crime and violence in their own 
country.'

Congress fared a little better in this month's poll, getting a one percent boost, but the legislative branch is still stuck in the red with a 14 percent approval rating.

Republicans in Congress received especially low marks, with just 19 percent of Americans saying they view members of the political party positive compared to the 31 percent said the same of Democrats.

Even though respondents said they view Democrats in higher regard, they were split on which party they want to represent them in Congress. The poll found that 44 percent of survey takers want Democrats to take charge of Congress, while 43 percent want Republicans at the helm.

This month's poll wasn't all bad news for Congress, or Obama for that matter. While neither are particularly liked by Americans, they're not as unpopular as Russian President Vladamir Putin, who is
 viewed favorably just four percent of Americans.

Obama is also better liked that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
'Bibi' Netanyahu and Secretary of State John Kerry.

Netanyahu and Kerry netted 24 percent and 33 percent positive ratings, respectively. The two men weren't as intensively disliked as Obama, however, clocking in at 15 percent and 33 percent on the negativity scale. Obama was viewed negatively by 47 percent of people surveyed.
