It was revealed earlier this year that Lindsay Lohan had been banned from the prestigious Chateau Marmont Hotel for reportedly not paying a $46,000 bill.

But it seems the hotel may have finally sorted out their differences with the 26-year-old actress making a return on Thursday night.

Lindsay - sporting new red hair extensions - was seen sneaking out of the hotel, which is also famous for its nightclub, in the early hours of Friday morning, after celebrating the launch of the Mr Pink vitamin drink earlier in the evening.

We can see you! Lindsay Lohan was seen making a return to the Chateau Marmont hotel, just a few months after being banned from the venue for not paying her $46,000 bill

Her outing to the premises came after the hotel's general manager Philip Pavel wrote a letter to Lindsay in July, informing her that she was no longer welcome in Chateau Marmont.

The letter read: 'As you are aware from our previous correspondences starting on 
July 8, you currently owe the hotel a grand total of $46,350.04 in 
charges for your stay starting on May 30, 2012.

'As we have made repeated attempts to 
resolve this pressing matter over the last few weeks without any 
resolution, I regret to inform you that we will no longer be able to 
extend any further credit for you to remain in the hotel.

The location: Lindsay was also banned from eating at the restaurant or being on the property at all when she was sent a letter by the general manager in July

‘Please have all of your belongings removed from Suite 33 by 12:00PM, Wednesday, August, 1, 2012.’

Not only was Lindsay told that she would
have to leave her suite at the hotel, she was also told that she could 
no longer use the facilities or eat in the popular restaurant.

But either Lindsay sneaked into the hotel without anyone noticing, or she has succeeded in paying her outstanding bill, judging by her attendance at the venue on Thursday night.

to set the record straight.

She said: 'I told my dad a really hurtful and untruthful lie about my mom. She was not on cocaine.

'Daughters have fights with their moms. It happens a lot. It's normal.'

Lindsay added that a 'personal argument' erupted between the pair on their way home and she called her father with hopes he could diffuse the situation. But her efforts backfired.

'I think everyone kind of knows my father's main objective has always been to discredit my mom and gain all he can to gain what he can from my name in a sensational and obvious hunger for fame,' she said.

All-star attendance: Paris, Prince and Blanket attended the event with their aunt LaToya Jackson

Enjoying that: Prince Michael Jackson II, aka Blanket, appeared to be enjoying the vitamin drink

'I'm ashamed for him. And it's hurtful to me that he's chosen this road to go with yet again. It's unfortunate that I can't just call my dad and have a conversation.'

Lindsay said she was 'regretful' about the argument with her mother, adding the she said things that were 'really hurtful and untrue'.

'My mom does not do cocaine, clearly, and that's a fact. She's an amazing woman,' the actress said.Police arrived to Dina Lohan's Merrick, Long Island home after Lindsay's frantic call to her father.

Famous faces: Audrina Patridge, Kimora Lee Simmons and Anna Kendrick also attended the launch

But the actress said despite the explosive nature of her allegations at the time, she never indicated he should call the police.

She insisted: 'That was my dad that did that. That was never asked of him and he should not have done that.'
