Two Massachusetts women have been fired from their jobs after posting a photo to Facebook in which one of them was depicted flashing her middle finger at Arlington National Cemetery.

Lindsey Stone, 30, and coworker Jamie Schuh, 38, were sacked from their jobs on Wednesday after the photo, which Schuh snapped of Stone, sparked outrage online. The incident inspired an unidentified Facebook user to start a group called 'Fire Lindsey Stone,' which helped the photo gain even more attention this week, garnering more than 19,000 'likes' since Monday from other users.

The girls' employer, Living Independently Forever (LIFE), posted a statement on its Facebook page Wednesday announcing that both Stone and Schuh were fired.

Shocking: Lindsey Stone flashed the obscene gesture at Arlington National Cemetery, next to a sign that asked for respect

'We wish to announce that the two 
employees recently involved in the Arlington Cemetery incident are no 
longer employees of LIFE,' the statement read. 'Again, we deeply regret 
any disrespect to members of the military and their families.'

Stone and Schuh had been placed on unpaid leave immediately following the incident, which made national headlines.

LIFE, a community for adults with 
disabilities, plans to delete all comments regarding the incident from 
its Facebook page in an effort to protect its residents, the 
organization said.

'We appreciate your concern and understanding as we focus on the care of our community,' a LIFE representative wrote.

Stone's father has called his daughter's behavior 'disgraceful' and said the picture was a 'total lapse of judgment.'

Peter Stone insisted his daughter 'apologize to everybody' for the obscene gesture, which the 30-year-old made at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in October, next to a sign at the 
military cemetery that asked for 'Silence and Respect.'

Stone, who lives in Cape Cod, visited the sacred military cemetery in Arlington, Virginia in October on an outing with the non-profit organization where she works, LIFE organization.

'It was just a spur of 
the moment, total lapse of judgment,' Peter Stone told WCVB-TV. 'She wasn't reacting to the place; 
she was reacting to the sign and she apologizes to everybody.'

Deeply saddened: Lindsey Stone has been placed on leave at LIFE, the community for disabled adults in Cape Cod, Mass., where she was employed

Disrespectful: Thousands of Facebook users have called for Lindsey Stone (appearing in December 2011 at the Special Olympics Jolly Jaunt for work) to be fired for her offensive picture

Stone was among eight staff members 
that traveled with the group of 40 residents to the nation's capital for
this trip. Photos from the organization's Facebook page show residents 
touring the White House and the Washington Monument on October 20.

At
the military remembrance site, she posed for the offensive picture, 
that was taken by Schuh, and then Stone uploaded the 
snap to her own Facebook page.

The photo went viral and Facebook users were shocked to see the pose at a place meant to honor fallen heroes.

Soon a page was started to alert the wider web of Stone's action.

An unknown Facebook user, who is believed to be an Iraq War veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, created a page on the social networking site, 'Fire Lindsey Stone.'

The page, which was started on Monday, had the stated intent to 'only accept termination.' By Wednesday, a competing Facebook page had been created: 'Hire Lindsey Stone.'

'Some may have heard news that Lindsey Stone, a 30-year-old human being with friends and family and who likes kids and animals and works at a non-profit, has been targeted by a bunch of misdirected morons in a hate campaign to get her fired from her job,' the creator of the page supporting Stone wrote in a posting.

Punishment: A Facebook page entitled 'Fire Lindsey Stone' has garnered over 6,000 Likes and Stone's employer said that Stone (right, in an undated photo in Times Square) has been placed on unpaid leave

'This group is designed to get her a 
better job, and to show what irrational, ridiculous logic is being used 
to potentially ruin the career, and life, of a foolish girl, who made a 
mistake. Big deal.'

The Facebook page only attracted 39 Likes on Wednesday.

Stone's employer said that they were made aware of Stone's shocking post on November 19.

'This photograph in no way reflects the opinions or values of the LIFE organization, which holds our nation’s veterans in the highest regard. We are proud to have veterans serving on our staff and board of trustees, and we value their service'

'The men and women who have selflessly fought and sacrificed their lives to protect the rights and lives of Americans deserve our utmost respect and gratitude.'

'We are acutely aware that this photo has done a disservice to veterans and we are deeply saddened that it was taken and shared in a public medium,' the statement added.  

Justified? Stone (pictured left: with her co-worker Jamie Schuh in April) said in a statement that she posed for the picture for her own amusement (pictured right: at a work holiday party in December 2011)

Jim Godsil, the chief financial officer of LIFE, spoke to the local media about Stone's 'despicable 
behavior.'

'We have codes of conduct in terms of
how we expect our employees to act, and this could potentially be in 
violation of that,' he said, hinting that she could possibly be terminated after an investigation.

Stone has issued a joint statement with Jamie Schuh, her director who took the photo, to apologize.

'We sincerely apologize for all the pain we have caused by posting the picture we took in Washington DC on Facebook,' the pair said in a statement. 'While posted on a public forum, the picture was intended only for our own amusement.'

'We never meant any disrespect to any
of the people nationwide who have served this country and defended our 
freedom so valiantly. It was meant merely as a visual pun, intending to 
depict the exact opposite of what the sign said, and had absolutely 
nothing to do with the location it was taken or the people represented 
there.'

'We never meant
to cause any harm or disrespect to anyone, particularly our men and 
women in uniform. We realize it was in incredibly poor taste, and are 
deeply sorry for the offense we have caused.'

Apologies: The woman's father, Peter Stone, insisted that his daughter meant no disrespect

'We also sincerely apologize to LIFE, Inc. It is an amazing organization that provides invaluable services to adults with learning and developmental disabilities. We are beyond remorseful that our actions have caused them such undue public scrutiny. The disrespect implied by our picture has nothing at all to do with LIFE’s mission statement or values. We regret having caused any suffering to the staff members, residents, families and friends.'

'Again, we very sincerely apologize to everyone who took offense to the photo. We realize that it was an ignorant and distasteful thing for us to do, but we truly meant no harm. We are deeply sorry,' they added.
