The number of children who have died from asthma attacks in the past two years has sky-rocketed, new figures have revealed.

The latest New South Wales child death review found that in the last 10 years, 20 children have died from the respiratory disease but the alarming figure is that half of those deaths occurred in the past two years.

It was also found, there were more deaths in 2010, 2012 and 2013 than in previous years and more than two thirds of those children were male, twice the rate of  girls for the same period.

In most cases, it's been put down to complacency, the children who died from asthma had factors that may have increased their risk of death.

The latest New South Wales child death review found that in the last 10 years, 20 children have died from asthma attacks

These included sub-optimal level of asthma control, insufficient follow-up after a hospital visit, poor adherence to recommended asthma medication or action plans and exposure to tobacco smoke.

Surprising figures in the past two years have seen the number of children dying from asthma attacks has increased in NSW

The report states the majority of the children had more than one risk factor, while insufficient follow up after a hospital admission was a factor for eight children who did not visit a doctor.

For four children, it was unclear who in the family was overseeing the child’s asthma management.

While in relation to the fatal asthma attack, in six cases there were indicators that the child or the child’s family may not have recognised early signs that asthma symptoms were slowly worsening, or may not have fully appreciated the severity of the child’s condition.

NSW Asthma Foundation CEO Michele Goldman says the figures are surprising since there has been a downward trend in childhood related deaths in the last decade.

'They show asthma is not being taken seriously, some deaths could have been prevented,' she said.

'The foundation strongly advises people to take asthma more seriously, making sure children have an asthma action plan in place and preventative measures are taken regularly (because some people get caught out).'

'When the child does start to expose symptoms, something must be done within minutes.'

Ms Goldman says there is still a lack of understanding because asthma is a complex disease which impact people differently.

'To find the right medication, to find the right dose is not the simplest thing in the world but education is key,' she said.

The Asthma Foundation regularly conducts survey in a bid to get a reading of how well asthma is controlled and other key issues.

'Most people thought it was well controlled but three quarters of cases are not well controlled according to our asthma test.'

Australia has the highest incidence of asthma in the world, with every one in ten Australian suffering from the disease.

But over the last decade there has been a significant decrease in deaths.

'There was 1000 deaths in the late 1980s and recently there's been around 400 deaths,' said Ms Goldman.

'There's still more work to be done.' 

The Asthma Foundation has encouraged people on its website to take the asthma control test, a way to work out your level of asthma control.

It asks five questions, including, how often you've had shortness of breath, and the asthma score will assist health care professionals in helping sufferers to reach the best asthma control possible.
