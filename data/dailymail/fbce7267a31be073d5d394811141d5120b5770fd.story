The Justice Department has been secretly gathering and storing hundreds of millions of records about motorists, raising civil liberties concerns.

In an effort to build a national database that tracks the movement of vehicles across the country, a program run by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) launched in 2008.

The DEA's main aim was to seize cars, money and other assets to fight drug trafficking, reported the Wall Street Journal. 

But the database was also being used for hunting vehicles linked to other possible crimes, such as kidnapping, killings and rape suspects, citing current and former officials and government documents.

The National License Plate Recognition initiative connects DEA license plate readers with those of other law enforcement agencies across the country, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) through a Freedom of Information Act report.

It was revealed that the initiative targets roadways that the DEA believes are commonly used to transport contraband. It also data mines license plate reader data to identify travel patterns.

Key findings from the documents showed that by 2011, at least 100 license plate readers across the US were feeding into the database. The DEA also set up 41 plate reader monitoring stations in California, New Mexico and Texas.

Many local and regional law enforcement systems contribute location information to the program which opened up to partners in May 2009 - including California’s San Diego and Imperial Counties and New Jersey, who both provide information to the DEA.

Some agencies are partnering with the DEA but their agreements remain secret making it difficult for the public to know who has their location information, the findings from ACLU said.

Custom and Borders Patrol is one of the federal agencies that has shared information with the DEA. In a response to ACLU's FOI request, CBP said it collects nearly 100 per cent of land border traffic, which means between May 2009 and May 2013, it amounts to more than 793.5million license plates.

States such as Utah have not embraced the idea of its license plate readers feeding into the database. The government wanted to add monitors on major drug-trafficking routes in the state, such as Utah's Interstate 15, to track more criminals, which alarmed privacy advocates, the Journal reported. 

While U.S. officials have said they track vehicles near the Mexican border to combat drug cartels, it had not been previously revealed the DEA had been working to expand the database 'throughout the United States,' the Journal said, citing an email.

It said many state and local law enforcement agencies were using the database for a variety of investigations. It added it was unclear if any court oversaw or approved the program.

The Journal quoted Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as saying the use of license plate readers 'raises significant privacy concerns.'

A spokesman for the Justice Department, which oversees the DEA, said the program complied with federal law. 

'It is not new that the DEA uses the license-plate reader program to arrest criminals and stop the flow of drugs in areas of high trafficking intensity,' said the spokesman.

The spokesman also said the agency has reduced the amount of time it holds the data from two years to three months.

In its report, the ACLU said the DEA should be open about what it is doing so that activities can be subject to public debate. It said when programs are secret, the public has no way of challenging them or ensuring they conform with values and the law.
