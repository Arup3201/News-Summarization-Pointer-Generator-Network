Only last week, Karlie Kloss was partying the night away at the Met Gala, and she's still staying up late - but this time with her study books.

The 20-year-old Victoria's Secret Angel revealed on Instagram that she is taking part in a program at Harvard Business School.

'I am very excited to be spending a few days here on the Harvard Campus in Cambridge for a class this week', she wrote alongside a photo of herself posing next to a statue of the University’s founder, John Harvard.

Not just a pretty face: Supermodel Karlie Kloss, pictured posing with the University's founder, has been taking part in a week-long program at the Harvard Business School

According to The New York Post, she has been studying 'The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports’.

On completion of the program, Miss Kloss will receive a certificate, which will no doubt delight the model, as she has been talking about her hopes of studying at the illustrious Ivy League University for some time.

The statuesque Vogue favorite told The Daily last year that she would like to focus on business so she can learn how to 'run a successful company'.

And it was fellow supermodel Tyra Banks who inspired her to consider courses at the Boston-based institution.

Ms Banks, 40, completed a nine-week entrepreneurial program at Harvard in 2012.

'Tyra [Banks] did it... I can do it, too,' Miss Kloss explained.

It is likely that the American-born beauty has also been consulting her tech investor boyfriend, Josh Kushner, on the subject.

Mr Kushner, 28, graduated from Harvard in 2008 and stayed on to complete the school's business prestigious MBA program in 2011.

Talking about her future, Chicago-born Miss Kloss, who is now based in New York, said: 'I feel fortunate to have an incredible 
career and experiences behind me but there is so much more that I want 
to do with this career and with my life.

career but there is so much more that I want 
to do with my life'

'Now that I am getting more and more 
involved in these entrepreneurial projects I think business is something
 that would also be fascinating. 

'To have a better understanding of economics and business, and the way to run a successful company.'

Proving her business acumen, she launched a gluten-free cookie product called Karlie's Kookies at New York Fashion Week two years ago, in collaboration with popular Manhattan bakery Momofuku Milk Bar.

Proceeds raised from the sweet treats benefited hungry children around the world and the cookies are still available online for $22 a tin.

Other than business, Miss Kloss said that she has always had an interest in medicine as her father is an emergency room doctor.

Tyra Banks previously said that she found her $100,000 program at Harvard tough going at times.

'I think they make it hard on purpose. Once you get done reading one assignment, you get another,' she complained.

A string of models have demonstrated that they have brains as well as beauty. Christy Turlington earned a degree in Eastern religion and philosophy from NYU, while Lily Cole famously scored a double first in History of Art at the University of Cambridge.
