An animal handler who suffered puncture wounds to both hands after a crocodile latched onto him at a zoo on the NSW south coast is now undergoing treatment at a specialised hand hospital.

Trent Burton, 31, was bitten and dragged into the water by a 3.7m crocodile he was feeding at Shoalhaven Zoo on Monday afternoon.

He was discharged from Shoalhaven Hospital late on Monday night and has since been receiving treatment at the Sydney Hand Hospital.

Trent Burton, a handler at Shoalhaven Zoo, was taken to hospital on Monday suffering bites to both hands after being attacked by the crocodile he was feeding

Mr Burton, who is due to see a specialist today, broke one of his left fingers and has lacerations on his left hand that needs stitching.

'Trent was just happy that he had feeling in his hand and could move his fingers,' Shoalhaven Zoo owner Nick Schilko told MailOnline.

'We are just thankful that he is alright. He had a little bit of damage to his right hand that had a few stitches but his left hand needs specialist treatment.

'They want a specialist to look at it to clean and treat it properly before they do anything else.'

Mr Burton, who has been handling crocodiles for more than 10 years, was presenting a regular feeding show at the zoo when the croc, known as John, latched on and dragged him into the water.

He managed to scramble out of the water as a shocked school holiday crowd watched on. 

'Trent was feeding the croc... He flipped the food at his (the crocodile’s) face. He caught it in his mouth and as he’s tried to flick it up to put it in his mouth further, Trent tried to reached and take it out of his mouth,' Mr Schilko said.

'He was beating himself up over what he did. Basically his hand got caught in the moment... the crocodile has gone bonus and started backing up to the water and dragged him all the way into the water'

He was presenting a regular feeding show at the zoo at 12pm when the 3.7 metre male crocodile, known as John, latched on and dragged him into the water

'It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life. I've seen them in the wild and at Steve Irwin's zoo but never anything like this,' Marlene Orr, from Shellharbour, said on Monday.

Mr Burton was treated at the zoo by paramedics before being taken to hospital with puncture wounds to his hands.

It's not known when Mr Burton will be back working at the zoo, but Mr Schilko said the crocodile handler would want to be back soon.

'He’s not a sook so he wants to be back at work as soon as possible. I will allow him to come back to work whenever the doctors say he can,' he said.

The handler was holding out a piece of meat during the show when the crocodile snapped it up before he was supposed to, according to one woman in the crowd
