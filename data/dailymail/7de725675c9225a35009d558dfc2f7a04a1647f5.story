A Chinese company intends to build a new 'Chinese Disneyland' theme park in Australia, which they claim will draw tourists from around the world when it opens in 2016.

New plans have been unveiled for the development of a $500 million Chinese-inspired theme park called Chappypie China Time in Warnervale, just over an hour's drive north of Sydney.

Despite it's strange name, locals are tipping it will be a tourist attraction to rival Opera House and Harbour Bridge once it's finished.

The Chinese theme park at Central Coast NSW is expected to be a major national tourist attraction  

The sprawling, 15-hectare theme park will feature everything from giant rollercoasters and other Chinese themed rides, to Chinese calligraphy classes, traditional theatre and music performances.

The entire site will be landscaped with Chinese gardens and statues and feature Australia's links with China, as well as a flying golden dragon winding its way through the park.

The proposed theme park will feature 12 main sections - which includes the Meridian Gate, thanksgiving Temple, Zheng He’s Treasure Ship, arts and crafts workshop, Spring Festival Square and Panda Paradise.

The owners of the proposed Chinese Cultural Theme Park have developed extensive plans for the theme park, which will be located next to Warnervale Airport, the Central Coast Express Advocate reports.

Wyong Shire mayor Doug Eaton told ABC the park will cater for the growing Chinese tourism market and provide a massive boost to the coast's economy.

'It'll be the major tourism drawcard, I'd suggest, not just for the Central Coast, but everywhere outside of Sydney.

'It'll rank in the top five at least, if not in the top three destinations in New South Wales.'

Wyong Mayor Doug Eaton said the park would be a major boost for the local economy

Mayor Eaton said he was incredibly excited about the prospect of half a billion dollars of investment heading his way, according to the Central Coast Express Advocate.

The development application for stage one of the park could be open as soon as 2016 if the proposal gets approved.

'I’ve truly never seen anything like this before — it’s going to blow people away when they watch the video and get a sense of how big and imaginative this concept really is and what it can do in terms of tourism for our shire,' Mr Eaton said.

'The developers have long been telling us that this theme park will be up there with the Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge in terms of tourist attractions and I’ve got to hand it to them — it’s absolutely in that category.'
