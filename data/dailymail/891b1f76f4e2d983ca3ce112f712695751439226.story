A man believed to have been at the wheel when young Queensland woman Ashleigh Humphrys died in a hit-and-run has been found dead.

Police say the 57-year-old died suddenly and there are no suspicious circumstances.

The man was the owner of a car seized by police investigating the death of Ms Humphrys early on Sunday morning, after a night out to celebrate her 20th birthday.

It's believed she was drunk and lying on the Western Freeway at Mount Coot-tha, in Brisbane, when she was hit.

The Courier-Mail said the man was driving to work early on Sunday, and went to work as usual, not realising he'd hit the young woman.

A witness who recorded the man's licence plate led police to the vehicle earlier this week but no charges were made.

Humphrys reportedly died after deciding to walk from Toowong to her Seventeen Mile Rocks home in Brisbane after having an argument with a friend while they were out celebrating her 20th birthday. 

The young 20-year-old woman is believed to have either have been on her hands and knees or lying on the road.

Police said people tried to put Ms Humphrys, who was understood to be intoxicated at the time, into a cab at a Caltex service station but she walked away. 

A security guard from a nearby service station called police after he witnessed her walking in a disorientated state along the road.

Tributes have poured in for Ms Humphrys on Facebook.

'Baby girl, there have been so many things running through my head all day, but I mainly just want to say I am so thankful that I had the pleasure of having you as one of my close friends,' a friend posted.

'You were such a beautiful person, inside and out. Your laugh was contagious and your kindness was shared among so many. Gone, far too soon.'
