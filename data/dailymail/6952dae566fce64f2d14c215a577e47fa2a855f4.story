An inventive new lookout on the shores of Loch Voil is allowing tourists to hideaway in the Highlands.

The new structure in Scotland’s Trossachs National Park appears to blend into its environment thanks to the clever use of mirrored walls.

The wood-framed pavilion frames various views of the loch and surrounding countryside, which is reflected by the stainless steel mirrors, creating a unique surface that changes with the weather.

Now you see it, now you don't: Clever use of mirrored walls allows the lookout to blend into its environment

A two-seat beach on one side of the tiny structure allows visitors to sit and admire views over Loch Voil and Loch Doine.

On the other side is a smaller seat for one, along with a window that lets people peer out to the loch.

The building is the brainchild of architecture students Angus Ritchie and Daniel Tyler, who designed the lookout as part of their thesis at Strathclyde University.

Perfect spot: The lookout is located close to Loch Voil in the Trossachs National Park

Blending into its environment: The new lookout is easy for walkers to miss

The duo received funding from the Scottish government for the project, which cost £5,000.

The lookout's frame was made using thermally-treated African hardwood and was assembled off-site and lifted into place using a digger.

The mirrored walls were then added to reflect the ever-changing scenery and give visitors several different perspectives on their environment.

Interactive space: A sign beside the lookout encourages visitors to 'please enjoy me!'

Time to reflect: The structure features wooden benches on each side so visitors can admire the view

Daniel Tyler told architecture and design magazine Dezeen: ‘The idea was to use a concept design from a first year room-with-a-view project selected by the national park at their final review.

‘Angus and I took that concept and developed and realised the resulting Lookout. The main concept taken from the first year design was the mirrored material, which the national park was particularity keen on, and framing of three views.’

The lookout is likely to prove popular with walkers eager to take a break from hiking in the stunning national park - as long as they can find it that is!
