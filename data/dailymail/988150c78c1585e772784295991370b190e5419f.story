This is the stunning optical illusion that appears to make a building at one of London's busiest tourist districts hover in mid-air.  

To passers-by, it looks as though a section of the historic market building in Covent Garden has broken free from its foundations and is floating unaided, high above them.

But in reality, the display, which imitates the architecture in the area, is a complicated piece of technical wizardry which took months to create.

The installation, named Take my Lightning but Don't steal my Thunder, was created by the artist Alex Chinneck (pictured), who is well known for creating optical illusions

Mind-bending: A passing couple peer inside the building which appears to be torn apart with one half suspended in mid-air with no support 

Technical wizardry: The stunning artwork replicates Covent Garden's historic Market Building perfectly but makes it appear if it has broken free of its foundations

Imitation: Construction workers in harnesses can be seen balancing precariously inside the perfect replica of Covent Garden's Market Building as it is lowered by cranes

Careful: A worker perches on a thin piece of scaffolding used as a frame for the installation before it is is lowered by a crane 

Awe: A woman stops to take a picture of the optical illusion as others walk through the artwork in between pillars which appear to have broken apart 

Illusion: A woman looks up at the top section of the building in London's Covent Garden as it appears to hover unaided above its foundations, its walls seemingly ripped apart through the middle

To passers-by it seems as though the building has been torn off and is levitating with a large gap between the broken 'stone' walls, pillars and doors

The installation, named Take my Lightning but Don't steal my Thunder, was created by the artist Alex Chinneck, who is well known for creating optical illusions.

It seems as though the 184-year-old market building has been torn off and is levitating with a large gap between the broken 'stone' walls, pillars and doors.

The 12-metre-long sculpture has been made from a steel frame and a type of expanded polystyrene called filcor.  

It is understood to have taken 500 hours to paint using special digital techniques and was designed to resemble the existing architecture in the area. 

The structure itself has been going up since the weekend using cranes, a number of trucks and cherry pickers.

Although it is his most ambitious project to date, it is not the first piece of trickery Mr Chinneck has created. In the past, using similar techniques, he appeared to have turned a house upside down in Southwark, London

The illusion of it floating is created by a four-tonne counterweight strong enough to support the top half of the structure as it hangs over the bottom half

Finishing touches: Men on cherry-pickers work on the upper levels of the artwork, while another man stands on top of the green stall that acts as a counterweight

A couple try to work out how the building appears to float in mid-air. Take my Lightning but Don’t Steal my Thunder and will be on display in Covent Garden East Piazza until October 24

The illusion of it floating is created by using a heavy counterweight strong enough to support the top half of the structure as it hangs over the bottom half.

A steel beam is hidden inside the green market stall to the side of the building and this is attached to a steel platform and a 12-metre cantilever.

Under construction: Workers in hard hats and hi-vis jackets work through the night on the work of art, layering plaster on the outside to make the stone columns feel real

Perfection: A man checks the paintwork finish on the building, which was designed to exactly match the architecture in the area and enhance the illusion

As if by magic: Workers busy themselves creating the optical illusion, while part of the steel supporting beam attached to the green wagon can be seen, right

He told the Telegraph: 'You can't tell the difference between the fake and the real thing, to touch it, to see it. But it's hovering. It's extraordinarily complicated. 

'As long as as many people enjoy it as possible, that's my aim. It's a logistical minefield that you have to navigate to get to a fun conclusion. 

'I didn't get into art for that, but that's what I do.'

Take my Lightning but Don’t Steal my Thunder and will be on display in Covent Garden East Piazza until October 24.

The art of illusion: How artist 'melted' one house and appeared to turn another building upside down

Alex Chinneck's latest project in Covent Garden is just his latest venture in messing with archaeology with mind-bending results.

In October last year the Hackney-based artist created a project in Margate called From The Knees Of My Nose To The Belly Of My Toes, which featured the facade of a derelict house appearing to slide off and into the front garden.

The property had recently been purchased by Thanet Council after sitting empty for more than 11 years, and Mr Chinneck persuaded ten companies to donate £100,000 in materials and resources to make the project a reality.

Melting away: In October last year Mr Chinneck also created this installation in Margate, called From The Knees Of My Nose To The Belly Of My Toes

Abandoned: The house had recently been purchased by Thanet Council after being abandoned for 11 years before Mr Chinneck set up his £100,000 project

The year-long installation, which exposed the top floor of the building to the elements, while relocating the front door into the front garden, was inspired by the opening of the new Turner Contemporary gallery. Afterwards the building was returned to the council.

Three months later Mr Chinneck was at it again, this time unveiling an installation called Miner On The Moon on a building in Blackfriars Road, London, which was due to be demolished.

The project made it appear as if the building, a former livery stables hiring out horse and carriages, had flipped upside down.

At the time,Mr Chinneck said: 'I'm keen on this idea that when people go to an art gallery they go there through choice and they enter into that experience.

Flip side: This former livery stables on Blackfriars Road in London appeared to have been flipped on its head in another of Mr Chinneck's artworks

Disused: Like his previous project in Margate, Mr Chinneck picked the building as it was about to be demolished and said it's shape inspired the upside down design

'But with public sculpture, people don't necessarily make that choice - they may not like the artwork or may not want the artwork and therefore I think it's important for the work to be able to disappear and not dominate its environment, but be harmonious with the environment.

'For that reason I used only the materials which feature across Southwark and Blackfriars so although the artwork is quite bold it also has subtlety and the ability to camouflage into its environment.'
