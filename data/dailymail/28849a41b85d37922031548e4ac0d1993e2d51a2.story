Sampdoria forward Stefano Okaka believes Mario Balotelli's lack of maturity cost him being a success in Italy with AC Milan, unlike Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Despite scoring 26 goals in 43 games for the Rossoneri Okaka insists Balotelli was a flop at Milan, and should point towards the example of Ibrahimovic to show him he under performed in Italy's top flight.

He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'Is the fact Balotelli left Serie A for England a failure for our football? No, if anything he is the one who failed.

'Does he think great champions were never under pressure? When Ibrahimovic was in Italy, he scored 30 goals per season.

'He mustn't keep looking to blame others. Mario is a great player, but if he had problems in Italy then half the responsibility is his.

'At times in life you need to stop and look inside yourself. The fact remains he is a great player and this new English experience might help him rediscover the hunger he once had.'
