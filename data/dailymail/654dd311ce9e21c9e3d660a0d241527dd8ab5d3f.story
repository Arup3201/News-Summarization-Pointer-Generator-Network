Nearly a third of five-year-olds in parts of London missed out on their first choice of primary school this year - new figures show.

Statistics published by the Pan-London Admissions Board reveal that across the capital more than 20 per cent of youngsters did not get a place at their preferred school that they were hoping for.

But the figures also reveal differences across the city, with children more likely to get their first choice in some areas than in others.

In Kensington and Chelsea 64.9 per cent of children starting primary school this September got their preferred option, meaning 35.1 per cent of youngsters missed out.

In Wandsworth 69.37 per cent of pupils got their first choice, with 30.63 per cent missing out.

At the other end of the scale, 85.36 per cent of pupils in Barking and Dagenham got their first choice, along with 86.01 per cent in Tower Hamlets.

Of 100,000 pupils in London applying for primary places this year, 6,220 youngsters did not get one of their choices.

A spokesman for the admissions board which co-ordinates school places for London said that 78 per cent of pupils got their first choice; while 90% got one of their top three, and 94 per cent got one of their six preferences.

Families across London found out on Thursday which primary school their child had got. Across England, many families will be finding out their allocation over the next few weeks.

Possible reasons for the figures include parents only listing one school when filling in forms, and a huge demand for some popular schools, the spokesman added.

Of those who didn't get the school of their choice; 4,700 have been offered an alternative, while around 1,500 currently have no school place.

Pan London Admissions Board chairman Helen Jenner said: 'Co-ordinating school admissions in London has meant a fairer distribution of available offers and has resulted in more parents getting an offer from one of their preferred schools earlier.

'It is important to emphasise that although the system is very efficient, it cannot create places at schools which are already full and not all parents can be offered their first preference.

'London local authorities are working hard to try to ensure that they can offer every child a school place but with this surge in demand it is becoming increasingly difficult.'
