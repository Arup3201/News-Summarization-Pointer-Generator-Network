It sounds like a dream - an island just a few metres off the coast of Posilipo, Naples, surrounded by crystal clear waters, with gorgeous views, winding lanes and a majestic villa. 

Isola La Gaiola is so close to the shore that it can be swum to easily from the mainland.

But its narrow streets are strangely silent - the island rarely gets visitors as it is reputed to be cursed and those who have lived there have met with a terrible fate.

Some of the island's unlucky owners faced economic ruin and tales of murders, drownings and suicide abound

Isola La Gaiola is in fact  two islands which are connected by a fragile stone bridge

Some of the island's unlucky owners faced economic ruin and tales of murders, drownings and suicide.

The string of bad luck started towards the end of the late 19th century when the island's first owner Luigi de Negri was struck with financial ruin after his fish farm business failed. 

The run of bad luck continued in 1920s when owner Hans Braun was murdered and his wife drowned in the sea. 

The island is now owned by the Campania Region authorities who have established the Gaiola Underwater Park

Eerie: The island is a few metres from Posilipo coast and is so close to the mainland that visitors can swim to it

Isola La Gaiola was then bought by a succession of people who had a run of bad luck after purchasing the land.

The list of destruction continued with the high-profile economic ruin, suicides and deaths of its owners - German steel industrialist Baron Karl Paul Langheim faced a failing business, head of Fiat Gianni Agnelli's only son committed suicide and billionaire oil tycoon Paul Getty's grandson was kidnapped.

The island's last owner Gianpasquale Grappone, who owned an insurance company, ended up in prison because of his debt. 

The island is now owned by the Campania Region authorities who established the Gaiola Underwater Park and designated the area as marine protected.
