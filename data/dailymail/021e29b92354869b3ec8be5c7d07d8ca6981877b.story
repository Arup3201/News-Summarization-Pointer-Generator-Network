At first glance £1.7million appears a low asking price for a Mediterranean island complete with woodland, private beaches and its own monastery.

But the piece of land has been on the market for three years and despite cutting the asking price in half, the owners haven't even had a viewing.

That is because this is the haunted island of Daksa, Croatia, where 48 people accused of being Nazi sympathisers were brutally executed in 1944.

Costing just £1.7million, this island may look like a tempting buy, but beware: this is the site where 48 people were massacred at the end of WW2, and the locals say it's haunted by their ghosts looking for justice

Legend has it that spirits of the dead men haunt the island, demanding justice against those responsible

Deserted: Even the owners of the island near popular tourist spots do not live on it - and few tourists visit

On October 24th, almost exactly 69 years ago, Yugoslav partisans celebrated their victory over the Nazis by rounding up anyone they thought corroborated with the enemy, including the village priest and mayor, Petar Perica.

The 'guilty' were then rowed out to the island where they were gunned down in cold blood and left unburied.

The locals were told that the same fate awaited them if they intervened, so the corpses remained uncovered for decades and it wasn't until recent years that they were finally laid to rest.

Legend has it that the spirits of the dead men haunt the island, demanding justice against those responsible. To date, the crime has never been investigated.

Nila Perica Dusilo Florshutz and Franica Dusilo Cavich, the current owners, don't live on the island and even at the height of the tourist season, few ever venture there.

The 12 acre island sits in front of Dubrovnik's Gruz port and despite 
the members of the Croatian Bishops' Conference visiting the site in 
October, 2009,it remains uninhabited.

By comparison nearby Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a popular holiday spot, especially with the rich and famous.

The likes of Roman Abramovich, Bernie Ecclestone, Catherine Zeta Jones, Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg have all spent summers there.

Marshal Josip Broz Tito was the Communist President of former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia of which Croatia was a part

Croatia did not exist as a country for most of World War Two, when the massacre took place, but was instead part of Yugoslavia.

From the end of World War One, when the state was first created, Croatians were unhappy with the union as they felt too much power had been handed to the Serbs.

When the Germans invaded after the start of World War Two, they exploited Croatian discontent to get soldiers to mutiny.

Once Yugoslavia was under Nazi control, Croatia was made an independent state and the Ustaša were put into power.

They began persecuting Serbs, Jews, Roma Gypsies and non-fascist Croatians and between 350,000 and 450,000 victims were killed in massacres and the notorious concentration camp at Jasenovac.

After the defeat of Hitler and the Nazis, Croatia became a republic within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Under communist control, many partisans in Yugoslavia felt the need for revenge against their Nazi persecutors and carried out acts of violence against those they held responsible.

The massacre at Daksa, in which 48 supposed Nazi sympathisers were killed without trial, is one example.

No investigation into the killings has ever taken place, and none of the perpetrators have been identified.
