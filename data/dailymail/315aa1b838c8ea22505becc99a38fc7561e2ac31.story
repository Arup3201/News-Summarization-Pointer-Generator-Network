The world is hardly short of pictures of Kate Moss. But for some people, seeing her on billboards or in magazine shoots is obviously not enough.

Today an original print of a nude shot of her taken in her early days of modelling - and said to be one of her personal favourites - sold for £16,250 at auction.

The 57in by 45in black and white image was taken in Marrakech, Morocco, by fashion photographer Albert Watson on a shoot for the German edition of Vogue  in January 1993.

‘I still think these are among the best pictures ever taken of her and she said so as well recently,’ Watson has said.

The iconic shot shows Croydon-born Miss Moss, then in her late teens, kneeling on a roof-top, with a crooked leg covering her modesty, and encapsulates the  controversial ‘waif’ look which helped cement her fame.

Her slender frame and gamine charm bucked the trend of the more curvaceous supermodels of the 1990s like Cindy Crawford and Elle Macpherson - and also fuelled the debate on size-zero fashion.

For her part, Miss Moss, now 37, said at the time: ‘I’m not as thin as people think… I eat normal things. I don’t diet to look like this.’

The print, sold at Bonhams in London to an anonymous UK private buyer, is one of a limited edition of ten. Another edition of four prints of the same photo but in a larger size also exists, and one of those sold for £54,000 four years ago.

Experts said that reflects the greater rarity of the larger version, rather than a decline in popularity of shots of Miss Moss among collectors. The print  sold yesterday was put up for sale by an unnamed seller with an estimate of  £12,000 to £18,000.

Last night photography specialist Jocelyn Phillips of Bonhams, said its value lay in a combination of factors, including the kudos of owning a famous  photographer’s original print.

‘Kate Moss is a contemporary icon and the photographer is a well-established name,’ she said.

‘Combine that with the size and limited edition nature of this lot and it all combines to make it interesting to collectors.’

Two other photographs of (a fully clothed) Miss Moss, auctioned in two separate lots at the same sale, were each bought for £2,750 yesterday.  

One shows her with her eyes shut and was taken by the late Corinne Day for The Face magazine in 1991 for a feature entitled ‘Heaven is Real’.

The other, by Mario Testino in 2005, shows her sitting in a café wearing a tie.
