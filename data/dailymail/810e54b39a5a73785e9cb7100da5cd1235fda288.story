A New York high school teacher who was secretly photographed kissing and cuddling one of her students on a park bench last year exchanged 1,400 texts with him over 11 days during their short-lived affair, city investigators have revealed.

Manhattan Theatre Lab HS teacher Julie Warning, 26, was fired earlier this year over the fling with her 18-year-old pupil, Eric Arty, Department of Education officials revealed yesterday.

When the photos first emerged last May it was uncovered that the high school teacher had fallen victim to a cruel and crude $500 bet between five friends about who could kiss her first.

The sly students even got passing tourists to take the photos, in order to make sure the teacher wouldn’t recognize them.

Arty beat his friends to the jackpot 
after first making phone contact with Warning in October 2011, and 
stayed in touch on and off until their very public make-out session last
 May.

When questioned by city 
investigators, Arty admitted to kissing his teacher but insisted it had 
been a ‘one-time occurrence,’ the investigative report says.

However he got ‘uncooperative’ after that and refused to say anything further, reports the New York Post.

Warning also met with the Department of Education Special Commissioner of Investigations, but 'declined to answer any questions about the matter'.

There was no criminal investigation because Arty was above the legal age of consent at the time of the affair.

The Department of Education was able to dismiss the novice teacher with relative ease because she was untenured.

Warning had only been appointed to her $48,434 teaching position as a social 
studies teacher at Manhattan Theatre Lab HS in October 2010.

Speaking last May about Arty's seduction technique, classmate Andrew Cabrera said: 'He would go after class and basically 
try to seduce her.

'I don't know if she knew [about the bet].
 They were all trying to get with her.

'One of his [Arty’s] friends 
flirted with her more than anyone - I thought he would be the one, but 
Eric came out of nowhere and got her.'

Other students told The New York Post
 how Warning at first tried to resist the teenagers and threw them out 
of her classroom when they would try to chat her up.

'He [Arty] would flirt with her,' said one junior. 'She would try to avoid it because she was his teacher.

'She was a nice teacher and didn’t 
want to report him, and she would throw him and his friends out of class
 for trying to flirt with her.'

Maia Torruella, 16, said: 'The way they act together... When he
 walks into the room, her face lights up,' she said. 'And when he's 
gone, she's boring. You can tell he's still on her mind.

'They're always so nice to each other. He flirts with a lot of girls, sure, but Miss Warning, ohhhhh!'
