A litter of newborn African Wild Dogs whose mother was deemed unfit to care for them has gotten some help from a very unlikely source.

Lilly, a golden retriever, is now a surrogate mother to  the pups, who were born at the Oklahoma City Zoo.

Lilly, who gave birth to her own puppy recently, is not only helping by feeding the pups, but also teaching them social skills.

Meet your new mom: Lilly, a golden retriever, is the new surrogate for a litter of African Wild Dogs at the Oklahoma City Zoo

Getting cozy: Lilly had just had a puppy of her own, so is able to feed and help socialize the newborns

Lucky guys: The newborn pups, two female and one male, were in trouble when their mother proved to have no maternal instincts 

'Even though Lilly’s not an African wild dog, she’s still much better suited to surrogate for our pups than humans would be,' zoo veterinarian Jennifer D’Agostino told News on 6.

'This is a positive for both Lilly’s offspring and the African wild dogs, as they will benefit from initial socialization with a canine species.' 

Lilly is a retired search and rescue dog that the zoo found after an exhaustive search. who lives in Wichita, Kansas.

The puppies, two female and one male, were born on Friday, but their mother, Xena, showed a lack of maternal care.

'In preparation for this birth, we have been monitoring Xena 24/7 by video. We know that she is an unproven mother and wanted to be ready to intervene if necessary,' said Laura Bottaro, animal curator. 

'We are hopeful that these dogs will thrive in Lilly's care and when they reach an appropriate age for socialization we will be able to successfully reintroduce them to their pack.'

Important birth: The African Wild Dogs are incredibly valued by the zoo as their population has decreased drastically over the past few years, with less than 7,000 adults

The staff at the zoo is very excited for the new pups as the number African Wild Dogs in the world have been decreasing drastically over the years, and the zoo has not had any newborns since 1997.

Currently, there are less than 7,000 adult dogs, with their population declining as a result of disease and loss of habitat.
