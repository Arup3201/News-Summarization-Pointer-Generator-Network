Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will admit to a relationship with a Connecticut socialite if forced to testify in court, DailyMail.com has learned. 

Legal papers disclose that he is to be questioned over whether he played a part in the breakdown of the marriage of Chelsea Kirwan and her last plastic surgeon husband, Laurence.

The papers Mrs Kirwan says that he will deny an affair during the marriage.

But DailyMail.com has learned that if he is questioned over whether they subsequently became lovers, he will admit to it. 

The Kennedy scion, who married actress Cheryl Hines in August, is to be questioned under oath as part of the bitter divorce between the couple.

Close friendship: Chelsea Kirwan, pictured in June outside her local gym in Bedford, New York, is believed to have had a friendship with Bobby Kennedy Jr. that spanned two years

He and Mrs Kirwan became friends before the collapse of her marriage but there have been persistent claims the relationship was intimate.

Neither has publicly confirmed or denied whether she was cheating on her husband.

Dr Kirwan’s lawyers have filed a motion to depose Kennedy, 60, in California.

However, Mrs Kirwan's lawyers argued at Stamford Superior court in Connecticut on Monday that Kennedy should NOT be deposed, saying it is merely a measure to 'harass, embarrass, oppress and annoy' her.

And, they added, Kennedy's testimony is 'immaterial to the issues before this court'.

Court papers for Mrs Kirwan obtained by DailyMail.com - and which she is legally compelled to treat as a statement of truth - go on to reveal: 'The actions of Dr Kirwan which led up to his wife's filing for divorce are well known by him and have nothing to do with any alleged affair by the wife with anyone, much less the proposed deponent.'

Separately a source with knowledge of the case said that Kennedy would admit to a sexual relationship after the end of the Kirwans' marriage if questioned under oath - as Dr Kirwan's lawyers are expected to.

As part of the legal argument to get Kennedy's deposition banned, the court papers state it is an attempt to subject anyone 'directly or indirectly connected' with her, by 'subjecting such persons to examination about their personal lives under oath and speculating about such details in the media'. 

As previously reported, Dr Kirwan, 62, was aware that his former wife had enjoyed a close friendship with Kennedy.

A source told DailyMail.com: ‘Laurence was well aware that his wife and Bobby had a friendship before their split and that they have had ongoing telephone calls.’

Compelling: Chelsea Kirwan's lawyers are making a legal bid to challenge Robert F. Kennedy Jr's. deposition in her divorce case. They state if called to testify, he will say a relationship started only AFTER Mrs Kirwan filed for divorce

Kennedy, who this month was seen hobnobbing with his wife Cheryl Hines, potential 2016 Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and his mother Ethel Kennedy at the RFK Ripple Of Hope Gala at the Hilton Hotel in Manhattan, allegedly had a two-year 'affair' with Mrs Kirwan, 42, which was reported earlier this year.

Soon after the news became public, a source said Kennedy was set to be questioned under oath as part of the Kirwans' divorce case, saying: 'Chelsea fears Laurence’s lawyers want to discredit her as a wife and a mom.' 

The pair were also pictured together at an event in Seattle in April 2013, where Bobby feted mountaineer Jim Whittaker. And she is believed to have accompanied him around the country.

Mrs Kirwan filed for divorce in 2012. Dr Kirwan's lawyers want to ascertain whether the friendship started during the Kirwans' marriage - and what the exact nature of the friendship was.

Kennedy married Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl, 49, on August 2 at the Kennedy compound on Hyannis Port, Mass, in front of the Kennedy clan, including his mother Ethel Kennedy, and watched by a starry crowd including Cheryl’s former co-star and good friend Larry David and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, while Natasha Bedingfield serenaded them.

He was married to Emily Black between 1982 until 1994 and they had two children. 

His second wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy - the mother of four of his children - killed herself in May 2012.

And asked about their relationship, Cheryl said: 'We share the same values. Family first. We like to have a good time and work hard. It’s fun to have a partner...It’s a good match-up.'

The new Mr and Mrs Kennedy have since bought a $5 million home in Malibu, California, and Kennedy now spends the majority of his time on the West Coast with his family.

He is believed to be spending two days a week in New York teaching at Pace Law School.

The Kirwans have had an acrimonious split. 

They have three children together and Mrs Kirwan has a daughter from a previous marriage.

Last month, Dr Kirwan had charges dropped after completing two years probation after being charged with attacking his ex-wife and step-daughter at their home in Connecticut.

When reached by Daily Mail Online, Dr Kirwan declined to comment, while Chelsea Kirwan declined to comment.
