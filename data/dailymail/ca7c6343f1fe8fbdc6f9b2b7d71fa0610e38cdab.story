An incredibly limber robo-ape that can clamber over obstacles, open doors and even drive a vehicle, has shown off its dexterity as part of a robotic challenge.

U.S. scientists created RoboSimian to assist in dangerous situations from a nuclear meltdown to the aftermath of a bomb explosion so that humans no longer need to risk their lives in such perilous environments.

However, in the meantime, the machine is competing in DARPA’s Robotics Challenge in Florida and has got through to the finals.

RoboSimian has four dexterous arms that bend in many ways to support its weight, open doors and enable it to walk along like a spider.

Two of its arms have three fingers to grip objects.

The robot measures 5ft 5in (1.64m) when it 
is standing up and weighs 238lb (108kg).

It has 28 degrees-of freedom for 
mobility and manipulation and folds into a relatively small volume.

Humans
 control the robot remotely using a normal computer monitor, keyboard and 
mouse.

The robot is designed to assist in dangerous situations such as nuclear meltdowns and  the aftermath of bomb blasts.

It 
runs on batteries, which is useful in areas that have lost mains power.

RoboSimian was built by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Stanford University engineers with the intention of being stable and flexible, rather than fast.

The robot has four dexterous arms that bend in an unusual way to support its weight, lift objects, open doors and allow the machine to walk along like a spider. It can bend them beneath itself to adopt a type of yogic pose.

Two of the arms have three fingers to grip objects and open doors, which are essential skills in an emergency, as well as in the trials.

To gain a place in the final, the robot battled 15 other teams to complete tasks including climbing ladders, clambering over obstacles, turning wheels and opening doors.

Other more fiddly challenges include 
removing debris, connecting a fire hose to a tap and breaking through a 
wall, as well as driving an emergency vehicle, as it is envisioned these
 robots could go to places too dangerous for humans.

RoboSimian, which was created by engineers at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion laboratory (JPL) and Stanford University based in California, is controlled by humans from a distance.

It is designed for stability, rather than rapid movement, which makes it more robust and reliable.

The DARPA robotics challenge comprises eight tasks: Driving a vehicle, negotiating tricky terrain, climbing a ladder, moving debris, opening a door, knocking though a wall, turning a valve and connecting a hose

Humans controlling the robot use a normal computer monitor, keyboard and mouse, which the creators believe will make life easier in an emergency situation.

The robot came fifth in DARPA’s competition - which was conceived following 
the nuclear meltdown in Fukushima, Japan - and was beaten by robots that looked more human in appearance.

The highest scoring robot – with 27 points compared to Robosimian’s 14 – is called Schaft and was built by a team in Tokyo, Japan.

The bipedal robot measures one-and-a-half metres tall and walks like a human and using its actuator, walking and stabilisation systems.

The winning team will receive a $2million prize.
