She has just been named the UK's top style icon and has barely put a Louboutin-shod foot wrong since launching her debut label six seasons ago.

But can you tell the difference between Victoria Beckham's  new budget line, VVB, and the high street copycats?

Her new boutique will be opening in London this week, displaying Victoria Victoria Beckham dresses as well as accessories and denim.

Striking gold: One of these dresses is £249 from M&S, but Victoria's design is almost three times as much

I felt so fabulously ‘Veebs’ wearing these gold dresses that I didn’t even feel absurd wearing sunglasses indoors – a look Victoria has been not-quite-perfecting since her Spice Girl days. 

I’m not sure how many non-famous people could get away with wearing a leather dress outside of my stomping ground of Soho, but this was definitely my favourite. 

Fit for a duchess: This lilac dress is a little demure for a girl about town, but Kate could pull it off

VVB’s crepe-silk lilac dress is so genuinely posh I can easily imagine the Duchess of Cambridge slipping into it for Royal functions. 

But it’s a little demure for a Girl Tottering About Town and the fabric was so delicate I creased it just by looking at it. 

Realistically, only someone with a ladies’ maid could rely on this dress as a wardrobe staple. 

For the red carpet: One of these almost-identical dresses is 27 times more expensive than the other

After years of red carpet events and premieres (darling) I thought I’d developed a serious case of expensive taste, so I was surprised to find I preferred the cheap dress to Victoria’s. 

Probably a good thing, because although I party with the stars, I don’t have the budget of one. 

A wag's whitemare: This ensemble feels a little Posh Spice circa 2006 when she was crowned Queen WAG

I did NOT feel very posh wearing Victoria’s bodycon white dress with a sheer panel. 

In fact, I felt like Posh Spice circa 2006, the year she was crowned Queen WAG at the World Cup for wearing outfits so skimpy that her boobs practically fell out. 

By comparison, the Jane Norman imitation felt almost luxurious. Both are the kind of dresses I’d expect to see worn on TOWIE – or at Aintree’s infamously naff Ladies’ Day. 

Loving the LBD: These little black dresses will make you feel a million dollars and could bag you a footballer

I felt a million dollars in this little black dress. So much so, I half-expected a multi-millionaire former footballer and national treasure to materialise and take my arm. 

Sadly, even this exquisitely made dress couldn’t work miracles. But if you want to bag a footballer, remember – VB did so in hotpants, not an LBD. 

Dinnerlady chic: Maybe Victoria thinks that this apron-inspired look will catch on?

At the risk of getting myself struck off the guestlist for Victoria’s launch party, I think she has had a private chef for too long. 

She has clearly forgotten what a dinnerlady looks like, or maybe she thinks ‘Apron Chic’ will catch on. 

Then again, I doubt Veebs does much washing up – perhaps that’s why she didn’t notice her dress looks like a tea towel.
