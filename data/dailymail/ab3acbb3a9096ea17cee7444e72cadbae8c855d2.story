Many saluted, some cried and a few held signs. But for 70 miles, hundreds of people paid their respects to a Second World War airman who died in combat in the South Pacific almost 70 years ago and was finally returned to his upstate home on Friday.

Funeral director Vincent Locovozzi, who escorted Sergeant Dominick Licari's remains from the Albany airport to the small town of Frankfort, said there was 'only one word that describes this: unbelievable'.

'He's a man who has been dead longer than most people have been alive, but he's a hero coming home,' Mr Locovozzi said.

Veterans groups, businesses and residents lined a 10-mile stretch of the Mohawk Valley to pay tribute to Licari as his remains made the journey home.

Honor guards from Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion chapters were posted along Route 5 as the vehicle procession carrying his casket left the New York State Thruway at Little Falls and traveled to Frankfort, west of Albany.

A commercial flight carrying Licari's casket arrived at the Albany airport, and military pallbearers carried the casket from the plane to the hearse on Friday evening, Mr Locovozzi, a distant relative of the fallen airman, said.

Licari's brother and sister, and several nieces and nephews, were at the airport to accompany his casket home, with the Patriot Guard motorcycle riders providing an escort.

'It's great to bring him back after all these years because you never leave anyone behind,' Fred Schultz, the post commander, told Times Union.

At Melrose Market, the windows facing the street were decorated with American flags and a sign that read: 'Thank you and Welcome Home Sgt. Dominick Licari'.

Organizations and business owners along Route 5 also posted signs in Licari's honor.

Lost: Licari's remains were only identified this year, after his fatal crash in 1944

'We just thought it would be a nice 
tribute for him for giving his life for our country,' grocery store 
owner Linda LaValla said.

'It's good to know that they take the time years later to find our servicemen and bring them home. It's closure for everybody.'

Clint Whittemore, of Chatham, was among those who gathered inside the airport to watch Licari's homecoming.

He said he came to support Licari's family, just as others had turned out when his uncle, airman Ken Scripter, was shot down and killed over Germany in 1943.

Mr Whittemore said found closure after his family tracked down the uncle's grave  ten years ago.

'To be able to identify the remains means a lot. I know it meant a lot to my mom,' he said.

Licari was a 31-year-old gunner on board
 a two-man Army Air Force A-20 Havoc bomber that crashed into a 
jungle-covered mountain in Papua New Guinea on March 13, 1944, while 
returning from a bombing raid on a Japanese airfield.

The pilot, 2nd Lieutenant Valorie Pollard, of Monterey in California, also was killed, along with four airmen in two of the mission's other A-20s, which slammed into the mountain in bad weather.

Licari, one of nine children, was officially declared dead in 1946. Last month, U.S. military officials notified his two surviving siblings that his remains and those of Pollard had been found and identified.

Pride: Ex-servicemen and residents lined the route from the airport as Licari was finally returned home

Licari's funeral and burial, with full military honors, is expected to be held in Frankfort on Tuesday.

Governor Andrew Cuomo directed flags on state government buildings to be flown at half-staff on Tuesday to honor Licari.

Pollard's burial arrangements are pending, a Pentagon official said.
