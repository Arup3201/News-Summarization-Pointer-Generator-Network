Tribute: 23-year-old Kingsman David Shaw was shot dead in Afghanistan and his father has backed a campaign to name streets after those killed in action

Streets across Britain should be named after fallen heroes killed in warzones across the world, campaigners have said today.

MPs and families who have lost loved-ones in action say the honour would be a fitting tribute to men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice.

The bereft father of a soldier killed serving in Afghanistan has also backed plans to name streets after fallen troops, and wants his son to be remembered permanently in his home town.

David Shaw's son, also named David, was shot dead by insurgents on January 16 and crowds lined the streets of Barrow, Cumbria for his funeral in early February.

23-year-old Kingsman Shaw, of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's 
Regiment, became the 440th British soldier to die in Afghanistan since 
2001.

His father, 49, said: 'There's always that danger when you have got 
somebody like David, who is known at the time, that their name could be 
forgotten by future generations.

'It's a strange thing to think about having a street named after our son.

'It's not for us to decide, it's for the local council and local people,
but we would be very proud to have a street named after David. It would
be the same for anybody in the same position.'

Dagenham and Barking has already implemented the idea, creating Tony 
Rawson Way and Martin Kinggett Gardens in tribute to soldiers who died 
in Afghanistan.

Precedent: Tony Rawson was 27 when he was killed in Helmand province in August 2007 and this street in Dagenham was named after him after a campaign by his mother Ann Williams (pictured with his former colleagues)

Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock said naming a street after Kingsman Shaw would be a fitting tribute.

He said: 'Most of us would rather live in a world where our service personnel were occupied in carrying out peace-time duties.

'But as long as events dictate that our men and women will be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, it is entirely proper for communities to pay tribute in this way.

'No one who recently attended the Barrow funeral of Kgn Dave Shaw would have any doubts about the willingness of Barrovians to name a street after this brave soldier whose life, full of promise, was cut short by a bullet in Afghanistan.'

Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy has called for councils to embrace naming streets after war heroes, saying they could provide a 'lasting personal memorial' to those who give their lives for Britain.

He said: 'This is a way for local people to show their solidarity and 
sympathy. A lasting personal memorial would demonstrate the value we 
place on individuals who have served but been lost in the defence of our
country.'

The local Government Association said councils have the powers to adopt the policy.

Chairman Sir Merrick Cockell said: 'Local councils have a long and lasting relationship with our Armed Forces and their families with many already signed up to the Governmentâ€™s community covenant and offering them support in housing, training and education.

'Re-naming streets is just one of the many ways that councils can choose to honour the brave servicemen and women who have given their lives serving our country.'
