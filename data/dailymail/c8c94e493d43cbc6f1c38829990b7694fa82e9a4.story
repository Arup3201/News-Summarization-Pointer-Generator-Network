A photographer with a passion for capturing cities from above has selected his most spectacular images of London from 2014. 

Jason Hawkes has been shooting aerial views from helicopters for over 20 years and boasts a portfolio of hundreds of thousands of aerial shots from all over the world and has produced 50 books of aerial photography.

The talented photographer takes more birds-eye view pictures in the UK capital than anywhere else in the world.

So dedicated is he to the Big Smoke, that he  flies over the city three or four times per week in a helicopter searching out the perfect shot. 

While tethered into the passenger seat, he leans out of the window to take these impressive photographs.
