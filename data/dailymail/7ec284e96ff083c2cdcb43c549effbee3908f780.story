Glen Codd, 27, was jailed for four years for raping a six-year-old girl in 2001 when he was about 12

A father-to-be has been jailed after he raped a six-year-old girl when he was just 12 - telling her it was 'only a game'.

Glenn Codd, 27, from Rochester in Kent, attacked the girl in 2001 - forcing her to perform a sex act and then raping her - but she only came forward more than a decade later, a court heard.

The orthopaedic technician denied rape and indecent assault at Maidstone Crown Court but was convicted by an 11-1 majority and sentenced to four years in prison.

The victim had told her mother what happened some years ago but she did not want to involve the police, the Kent Online reported.

It was not until November 2013 that she finally informed officers and Codd was arrested days later and charged with the offences, which he denied.

In a police interview, she reportedly said: 'He was trying to make a game out of it. He kept saying waggle was the game. I can see him saying "Waggle - x marks the spot".'

She also said that she had told a male friend that Codd had done things to her that 'were not right' but was 'too embarrassed' to say what.

Deborah Champion, defending, told the court that the 27-year-old already had a young son and was expecting another child.

She said: 'He has been of good character since. He is an exemplary family man, hard working and productive.

'He has not accepted the conviction. He still doesn't accept his guilt. The passage of time tends to block out things that have happened in the past.'

Judge David Griffith-Jones QC told Codd: 'The offences reveal you were somewhat precocious and because of your upbringing, which was somewhat harsh, you may have been more advanced about the ways of the world, in particular sexual matters, than your chronological age might have suggested.

'The fact is you took advantage of her immaturity and naivete. You preyed upon her sensibilities and used your position of power.'

Following the sentencing, Detective Constable Ally Smith, who investigated the case said: 'Codd took advantage of a young child's innocence in order to satisfy his own perverse sexual needs.

'This one incident has adversely affected the course of her entire life and she has had to adapt to deal with the trauma.

'I would like to pay tribute to the courage and fortitude she has shown in assisting us with this prosecution.'

As well as a four year prison term, Codd will also be listed on the sex offenders' register.
