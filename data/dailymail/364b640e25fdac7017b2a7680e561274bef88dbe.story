Christian Eriksen believes that for Tottenham to qualify for the Champions League this season, their record needs to improve against the Premier League's big hitters.

Spurs finished sixth in the Premier League last season, but their record against top-four clubs was diabolical, as they picked up just a single point in eight games, scoring just two goals and conceding an almighty 27.

And of particular damage were the 6-0 defeat away at Manchester City, and the 5-0 loss at home to Liverpool that cost Andre Villas-Boas his job.

Not good enough: Eriksen believes Spurs need to improve to qualify for the Champions League

Eriksen told The Sun: 'We did well against most of the other teams but against the top teams we were not very good and we were beaten pretty badly.

'I do not know why that was.

'At the start of the game you don't really think about it. You just think it is another game.

'But when you start to go three or four-nil down, you start to realise you are in a mega-big mess.'
