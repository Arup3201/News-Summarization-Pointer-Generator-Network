A schoolboy who was stabbed to death during a late-night row has been named as a talented footballer.

Joel Adesina, 15, collapsed in Bethnal Green, in East London, on Friday night after being knifed in the stomach. He was taken to hospital but died three hours later.

His mother was last night being comforted by family members who were said to be in shock.

Joel’s neighbours in Dagenham described him as an ambitious schoolboy who came from a hard-working family.

They said he never stayed out late and would be seen coming home in his football kit.

The manager of Joel’s football team said the winger was ‘as good as gold’ and talented enough to play professionally.

Ricky Downes, the manager of Bardag FC Yellows, said: ‘To say that myself and the club are devastated is an understatement, we are absolutely in bits.

‘Joel was a wonderful young lad who had the world at his feet.

‘He was a very talented footballer and had ambitions of playing professionally. I think he had a future in the sport and could have played for a living.

The 54-year-old added: ‘There was something about Joel that touched me and his death is totally unexpected. He never gave me any inkling that he was involved in gangs or anything like that.

‘He was cheeky, bubbly, and a thoroughly likeable young man.’

Police said the teenager from Dagenham was walking with friends when they were confronted by a group in a parked car.

The group were pursued into a housing estate where neighbours heard ‘screaming and shouting’. Joel was cornered and stabbed.

A Scotland Yard spokesperson said: ‘Police were called by London Ambulance Service to Bethnal Green Road, E2, at 23:04hrs on Friday, 5 December.

‘Officers attended and found a 15-year-old boy suffering from serious stab injuries to the abdomen.

‘The boy was taken by London Ambulance Service to an east London hospital. 

He died in hospital at 02:12hrs on Saturday, 6 December.’

An 18-year-old man was arrested but was released with no further action to be taken.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Jones of the Met’s Homicide and Major Crime Command said: ‘Anyone who may have witnessed this altercation or have information which could assist the investigation is asked to contact the police as soon as possible.’
