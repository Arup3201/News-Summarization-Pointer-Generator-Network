Jonas Gutierrez revealed on Tuesday night that he is suffering from testicular cancer.

The Newcastle winger returned to his native Argentina when the illness was diagnosed and he has since had his left testicle removed.

The 31-year-old said: 'When I confirmed that I had cancer I went home crying. This was the most difficult game I had to play.

'I detected a tumour in a testicle. I came here (back to Argentina) and I assumed the costs, despite having a contract with Newcastle.

'Money is not important. What is important is health and I had to start chemotherapy.

'It was hard to find my hair falling out. I did not want to cut it. I wanted to hold on.

'Fighting cancer makes the rest of the problems insignificant. I decided to tell my story because maybe this will help people who have cancer.'

Gutierrez, who signed for Newcastle from Real Mallorca in 2008 and spent the second half of last season on loan at Norwich City, tweeted yesterday: 'Thanks for all the messages, always looking forward.'
