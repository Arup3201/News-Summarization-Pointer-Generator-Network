Tragic: Horatio Chapple, 17, was mauled by a 39-stone polar bear as he slept during a trek through Norway

An Eton schoolboy was mauled to death by a polar bear while trekking through Norway after his team leaders used paper clips to secure the safety wire.

Horatio Chapple, 17, was on a £2,500 adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands when a bear entered their camp, dragged him out of his tent, and killed him.

Four others were severely injured before they managed to shoot the bear.

Today, it emerged the trip-wire which should have alerted them when the bear approached had been secured by a paper clip.

The alert system is designed to set off mines if an animal or intruder crosses the wire.

But organisers of the British School Exploring Society trek in August 2011, which hosted 73 children, today admitted one of the wires was faulty and a team leader tried to fix it using the piece of stationery.

The revelation comes at the start of an inquest into Horatio's death.

A report published to coincide with the first day found the trip wires were inadequate, there should have been a bear watch, and the team should have been trained to use rifles.

Sir David Steel, author of the report, blasted the 'inadequate' safety measures advised by Norwegian authorities, ruling that the incident 'was not unforeseeable'.

He said teams should not be allowed to trek in the Arctic Circle without proper rifle training.

And the team relied on an 'inconsistent' trip-wire system to alert them to the presence of polar bears - but it was inadequate as the warning would be too late.

However, Richard Payne, from the BSES, defended the move, claiming it made the wire more effective.

He said: 'The whole system is designed to give you an alert for you to wake up and do something about it. It's not a defence, it's not going to kill an intruder, it's going to alert you.'

Mr Payne also admitted that the tripwires were not working perfectly and one of the leaders had adapted one using a paper clip to make the trigger-mechanism more sensitive.

He continued: 'It was a paper clip and it did improve the system, and I had no reason to doubt that was the case.'

Mr Payne said that the alternative system of carrying out bear watches had been put in place at the base camp after a recent sighting of a polar bear in the region, but nothing had been seen for the week that they had been held.

Horatio's parents David and Olivia Chapple leave the Coroner following the first day of the inquest into their son's death. His mother said they presumed a trip so expensive would be safe

Danger: A report by Sir David Steel found the trip-wires used to sound alarms when a polar bear approaches did not work. The animal tore apart Horatio's tent, dragged him out and mauled him before chasing others

Horatio's parents Olivia, a GP, and David, a surgeon, appeared in court to say they presumed a trip so 
expensive would be safe.

Dr Olivia Chappel said she was 
'more anxious' than her husband and son and went through every detail in
 the risk assessment to reassure herself about the group's protection.

'The trip was an expensive trip, I believed that they would have proper equipment,' she said.

'I thought Horatio would have a bear flare, I thought they would have things like bear spray.

'I
 believed that the camp would be protected by trip wire. I was naive, I 
had no idea how a camp site should be set up at that stage.

'I
 didn't know there was the possibility that a trip wire may or may not 
work. I didn't know they were so fraught with difficulty.'

The team had set up camp on the Von Postbreen glacier and were sleeping in five tents when the 39-stone bear struck.

Four
 others were injured by the rampaging animal before team leader Michael 
Reid, 27, managed to shoot the animal in the head with a rifle.

Students Patrick Flinders, 16, and Scott Smith, 17, who were sharing a tent with Horatio, were seriously injured in the attack.

Shot: After a scramble to find bullets for a rifle, one of the leaders shot the underweight 24-year-old bear

Describing
 the incident, Sir David explained how the bear had approached through 
the north-western side of the trip-wire system but none of the warning 
mines had exploded.

It then ripped open the tent on Horatio's side and dragged him out, causing potentially fatal head wounds.

The rest of the camp woke up to screaming and shouts of 'bear!'.

Horatio
 appeared to try and sit up and stand but the bear reared up and slammed
 into him, pushing him to the ground. He was not seen to move again, the
 report says.

There was then a shambolic scramble for guns, but no one in the team could work the rifles.

'In
 the meantime,' he writes, '[one of the leaders] had got hold of the 
rifle. He operated the bolt to seek to load and cock the rifle but it 
failed to fire.

He 
operated the bolt on three or four more occasions without causing the 
rifle to fire. On each occasion a bullet was ejected on to the ground 
leaving the rifle empty.

'The bear then turned on [the leader]
 and mauled him about the head. He dropped the gun. [The other leader] 
had previously emerged from the rear of the leaders' tent.

'He was unable to pick up the gun as the bear was over it.

'He
 realised that, having seen the attempts to shoot the bear fail, he 
needed the spare bullets but was not immediately conscious of where they
 were and shouted for help in finding them.'

Unable to load a pen flare, he started throwing stones at the bear - which turned on him and mauled him too.

The
 bear continued to move between the bodies of Horatio and the two 
leaders, while attacking other members of the group as they tried to 
flee.

Sir David described how some members of the camp had managed to escape to about 20 metres from the scene.

He continued: '[The first leader] now managed to find one of the bullets that had been ejected, went back into the front of the tent to retrieve the rifle, loaded the rifle and, as the bear came back close to him, shot it dead.'

The trip was an expensive trip, I believed that they would have proper equipment

Sir David said the group then rallied and started to tend to the injured and calls were made for help from the local emergency services, although problems were experienced with the communications equipment, and the rescue team arrived by helicopter in a 'remarkable 35 minutes'.

A post mortem on Horatio concluded that his death was caused by 'extensive soft tissue and bone injuries to the face and neck including destruction of the right facial artery'.

An investigation found that it was 'a very old bear' in the region of 24 years old with 25 being the usual maximum.

It was seriously underweight, about 250kg rather than the typical 400kg and it had 'heavily worn and painful teeth'.

Sir David concluded by praising the group members for their bravery.

He said: 'All members including not least Horatio demonstrated great courage in the face of the attack which started while the camp was asleep.

'Likewise considerable presence of mind was shown by the uninjured members of the party in the aftermath of the attack in tending to the wounded and calling for help.'

The inquest continues.
