For nearly half a century, his medals simply gathered dust in a locked drawer.

Branse Burbridge rarely talked about his adventures as an RAF ace in the Second World War, not even with his closest family.

But the medals told their own remarkable story. One was a Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar, for his acts of gallantry in the face of the enemy. Another was the Distinguished Service Order and Bar, for an ‘outstanding’ devotion to duty.

Wing Commander Bransome 'Branse' Burbridge was the RAF's most prolific night-fighter pilot of the war, claiming 21 enemy kills. Now aged 93 (right), he is suffering from Alzheimer's and has been in a private care home since his wife Barbara died last year

For Wing Commander Bransome Arthur 
Burbridge – former conscientious objector, dedicated clergyman and 
devoted father – was the country’s most prolific night-fighter pilot 
during the battle against Hitler’s Luftwaffe.

Only when his grandson took an 
interest in the medals was the full extent of his heroism revealed. His 
RAF log book recorded 21 enemy kills, more than any other pilot flying 
night-time missions. But whenever he could, he aimed for the enemy 
plane’s engine to give the pilot and crew a chance of survival.

He downed four German planes in a 
single sortie and saved countless lives by bringing down three V1 flying bombs, jet propelled aeroplanes, before they hit civilian communities in London. But time appears
 to have evaporated the nation’s debt to Branse Burbridge, now 92 and 
suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. With much reluctance, his family is 
being forced to sell the medals to pay care home fees.

Yesterday veterans’ organisations 
blamed politicians for forgetting the risks Wing Commander Burbridge and
 his contemporaries took and the sacrifices they made. One described it 
as ‘a kick in the teeth’ and added: ‘Sadly he won’t be the last to have 
to sell his medals to pay for his care.’

The story of how a young bible-class 
teacher became an unlikely fighter ace began when Burbridge, who 
registered as a conscientious objector at the outbreak of war, decided 
the best way to serve God was to fight for his country against the evil 
of Nazism.

He signed up for the RAF shortly after
 turning 20 in February 1941 and was posted nine months later to 85 
Squadron as a night-fighter pilot.

The air ace flew Mosquitos with 85 Squadron and his first enemy kill was in February 1944 when he shot down a Messerschmitt 410 fighter plane off the Sussex coast. Above, some of his war-time sketches, also for sale

Burbridge's logbook from  November 1944 includes his four kills over Bochum, western Germany

Burbridge shot down three Junkers 88 bombers and a Messerschmitt 110 near Bonn, firing just 200 rounds in the process

David Erskine-Hill, of London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, which is selling the medal group, said: 'The Second World War produced many modest heroes who returned to civilian life and were reluctant to discuss their war-time exploits'

Flying a Mosquito, the dashing young 
pilot excelled. With his navigator Bill Skelton he formed a duo 
nicknamed ‘the night hawk partners’ – and shot down 21 aircraft in ten 
months.

The pair made 30 sorties over Germany to provide cover for British and Allied bombers.

One of his most exciting scrapes came 
on the night of March 24, 1944, when he became embroiled in a dogfight 
with a Dornier 217 bomber over the Channel. His Mosquito chased the 
aircraft from 19,000ft to 3,000ft before it crashed into the sea. 
Burbridge pulled up with only 1,000ft to spare.

His most celebrated achievement came 
in November 1944 during a bombing raid over Berlin. With just 200 
rounds, he shot down three Junkers 88 bombers and a Messerschmitt. In 
January 1945, he surpassed the record set by night-fighter legend John 
‘Cats Eyes’ Cunningham, famed for his ability to see in the dark.

Burbridge’s resolve to target aircraft
 engines rather than pilots meant that after the war, he was able to 
meet his chief adversary, Major Wilhelm Herget, whose plane he had 
downed. Burbridge happily took him for a spin in a Mosquito.

But not long afterwards, Wing 
Commander Burbridge put the war behind him. He studied theology at 
Oxford and became a lay preacher, dedicating much of his life to helping
 young people.

Soon after his wife Barbara died last 
year, however, it became clear his family would face a hefty bill for 
his care. Now they are trying to raise £120,000 from the sale of his 
medals, enough to provide for up to six years’ care at the ‘brilliant’ 
home where he lives. Yesterday his son Paul, a 59-year-old artistic 
director from York, said: ‘We’re reluctant to do it but we believe it is
 the right thing. He was happy to do the remarkable things he did and he
 survived. We value him more than his medals.

‘My father never really talked about 
his war experiences very much. It was only when my own son became 
interested for a school project that we sat down with Dad, and he took 
us through his log book.’

Recently Burbridge’s life was 
documented in a book, Wings and a Prayer. Author Gillian Warson said: 
‘He was extremely modest about the whole thing. He never understood why 
he had been rewarded for something he didn’t really want to do. He 
didn’t boast about it... just the opposite. Whenever he shot a plane 
down he always used to look behind to see if the pilot had got out.’
