Not even heart surgery could separate Raymond and Maizie Huggins.

Married for nearly 74 years, the nonagenarian West Virginia couple has spent decades doing everything together.

So when conditions worsened for their severe coronary artery disease, they figured they'd go the operation room the only way they know how: as a couple.

Sweethearts Raymond and Maizie Huggins have done most things together in their 73 years of marriage. Now, they can add 'heart surgery' to that list

'Mother and dad were very, very, very short-lived,' the couple's 67-year-old son, Roger Huggins,  told FOX 8.

'They had a couple of months to go — their hearts were completely closed off.'

Raymond, 96, and Maizie, 93, had stents put in about a year ago.

But their condition worsened in the last few months.

'I just prayed they would live long enough for technology to give them the opportunity,' Roger Huggins told the station.

The couple's son, Roger Huggins, says his parents' hearts were weakening quickly, and they would not have survived much longer were it not for the procedure

Luckily, doctors say, technological advances were on the couple's side.

'Ten years ago, if they came with this 
medical problem, we would have said that nothing really could be done 
where we can improve the quality of life,' Dr. Samir Kapadir, of the 
Cleveland Clinic, told FOX 8.

'Open-heart surgery could be performed, but the recovery is almost 3 to 6 months at their age.'

The couple had the procedure done on Tuesday and is expected to head back to West Virginia on Thursday.

They will celebrate their 74th wedding anniversary in October.

'We just really adore each other,' Raymon Huggins told FOX 8 when asked about the secret to their lengthy union.

Maizie Huggins added, 'Good father, good husband — he was just good all the way around.'

Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic say the couple would have as much as six months to recover from open-heart surgery. Luckily, the procedure they underwent was less invasive and they will be on their home this week, just days after the surgery
