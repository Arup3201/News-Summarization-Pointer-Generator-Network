The government is changing the law to drive through NHS changes after losing a court battle to close services at a London hospital.

The Court of Appeal ruled today that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt does not have the power to implement the cuts at the successful Lewisham Hospital in south east London.

But Mr Hunt said ministers are ‘now looking at the law’ to ensure changes can be driven through in future ‘when local doctors believe it is in the interests of patients’.

Warning: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government would change the law to make it clear that NHS changes can be made

Supporters of the Lewisham hospital cheered when the judges at the Court of Appeal backed an earlier ruling that Mr Hunt's move to downgrade A&E and maternity services was ‘unlawful’.

Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Sullivan and Lord Justice Underhill, rejected an appeal brought by the Government.

Campaigners said they were ‘absolutely delighted’ by the result. Rosa Curling, who represented the Save Lewisham Hospital Group, said: ‘It confirms what the Save Lewisham Hospital Campaign has been arguing from the start - that the Secretary of State did not have the legal power to close and downgrade services at Lewisham Hospital.

‘This expensive waste of time for the Government should serve as a wake up call that they cannot ride roughshod over the needs of the people.’

Mr Hunt's decision to close the services in Lewisham were quashed in July, when Mr Justice Silber declared that the government had breached provisions of the National Health Services Act 2006.

The ruling was a serious blow for Mr Hunt because the case involved the first legal testing of a new Government procedure for dealing with failing NHS organisations - referred to as the Unsustainable Providers Regime.

The Court of Appeal today upheld a ruling at the High Court in July

Under the new regime, Mr Hunt had appointed a Trust Special Administrator (TSA) to the ‘very badly performing’ South London Healthcare Trust, which went into administration after it started losing more than £1 million a week.

To help deal with the problem, the special administrator recommended measures including cuts at Lewisham Hospital.

Mr Hunt told Parliament in January that A&E and maternity services at the hospital would be downgraded.

He assured MPs the changes would improve patient care in south London, saving up to 100 lives a year, but gave an undertaking not to implement them pending the legal challenge.

Today Mr Hunt said: ‘I completely understand why the residents of Lewisham did not want any change in their A&E services, but my job as Health Secretary is to protect patients across south London - and doctors said these proposals would save lives.

‘We are now looking at the law to make sure that, at a time of great challenge, the NHS is able to change and innovate when local doctors believe it is in the interests of patients.’

An amendment is being made to the Care Bill currently going through Parliament to avoid a repeat of the legal challenge.

It will clarify that if changes need to be made at other hospitals they can be driven through, although it will not be retrospective so will not affect Lewisham directly.

But Andy Burnham MP, Labour's shadow health secretary, said: ‘This decision is a humiliation for Jeremy Hunt and raises major questions about his judgment.

‘Instead of graciously accepting the first court ruling, he has squandered thousands of (pounds of) taxpayers' money trying to protect his own pride and defend the indefensible. He is diminished by this ruling and has let down the NHS.

‘The court has done an important public service today in standing up to an arrogant and high-handed Government and a Secretary of State who is trying to close A&Es across London in the middle of the worst A&E crisis in living memory.’

Delight: Campaigners welcomed the ruling which means that 'Lewisham is now safe and this case is now over'

Vicky Penner, who has been involved in the campaign from the outset, was jubilant to be told by lawyers: ‘Lewisham is now safe and this case is now over.’

The mother of three young children, aged two, three and six, said: ‘We are absolutely over the moon. We are thrilled that justice has prevailed for a second time.

‘I was shocked that the Government was arrogant and foolish enough to carry on and try and bully through the closure of our excellent much-needed Lewisham Hospital.

‘The judgment made in July was very clear indeed - that they acted unlawfully - so this is a disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money by Jeremy Hunt.’

She said the Government had brought a last-minute amendment to the Care Bill giving trust special administrators (TSAs) much greater powers, which meant no hospital in the country would be safe and showed a ‘contempt for normal people and democracy’.

‘We are not against change in Lewisham but against the dangerous closure of vital services being rushed through without proper consultation.’
