The owners of a restaurant have been forced to change its name after millionaire designer Sir Terence Conran threatened legal action.

Alex McElhoney, principal owner of the Albion in Crosby, Merseyside, which opened in the summer, says he was shocked to get a letter demanding the change.

'I registered the company some time ago but didn't think to check for trademarks as Albion is the oldest name for Britain and I just didn't comprehend how that could be trademarked,' he said.

Alex McElhoney, principal owner of the Albion in Crosby, Merseyside, which opened in the summer, says he was shocked to get a letter from Sir Terence Conran demanding he change his business's name 

Sir Terence and business partner Peter Prescott established Albion Cafe in London's Shoreditch area in January 2009, the year he trademarked the name, and has since opened another branch near the Tate Modern.

Mr McElhoney and head chef Steven Burgess will now change the name to Albina after an exiled Greek Princess, from whom the name Albion derives. 

'It was completely out of the blue and somewhat baffling to be honest,' said Mr McElhoney, who named his restaurant after the traditional British dishes which are Mr Burgess's speciality.

'Why would a small high street restaurant in Crosby be any threat to London-based ventures? All we could think of was that we were receiving positive social media messages from the likes of Michelin-starred chef Aiden Byrne, or perhaps a Q&A Steven did with The Caterer magazine brought the attention.'

He added: 'I'd never heard of Albion cafe to be honest. 'We've had brilliant support from our regular diners as it is a clear case of the 'poor little northerners being attacked by the rich elite down south'.

'Having said that, from a business perspective they are right in protecting themselves and I wish them every success in growing their concept.

'It's a lesson learnt but it's still only the beginning of our story.'
