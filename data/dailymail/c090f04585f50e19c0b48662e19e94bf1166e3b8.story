A medical assistant told a jury that she saw one late-term baby who survived an abortion 'swimming' in a toilet 'trying to get out.'

Kareema Cross also claimed she saw the spines of at least 10 babies snipped using scissors during unorthodox late-term abortions at a West Philadelphia clinic.

Her revelations came in the last day of testimony before the prosecution rests in the capital murder trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell.

Gosnell, 72, a clinic owner, is on trial for the deaths of a patient and seven babies.

Charged: Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor, is accused of killing seven babies that were born alive

In the final day of testimony before 
the prosecution rests Kareema Cross, a 'medical assistant' who worked at
Gosnell’s Women’s Medical Society clinic for more than four years 
testified in a Philadelphia court room yesterday, CNSNews reported .

She spoke of the horror of witnessing babies who had survived abortions only to have their necks snipped in two using scissors.

'Did you ever see those babies move?' asked Prosecutor Joanne Pescatore.

'Yes, once in the toilet,' said Cross. The baby 'was like swimming,' she said. 'Basically, trying to get out.'

Other employees at the clinic also confirmed that babies were often expelled from their mothers into the toilet.

On at least one occasion the toilet had to be removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.'

The doctor: Kermit Gosnell

Charged: Pearl Gosnell

Employee: Elizabeth Hampton

Arrested: Tina Baldwin

Assistant: Lynda Williams

Worker: Adrine Moton

Accomplice: Eileen O'Neil

Mugshot: Sherry West

Held: Maddline Joe

Many pregnant women were given drugs to induce labor.

Cross, who worked at the clinic from 
2005 to 2009, was so disturbed by its operation that she took photos and
called authorities, although she gave a relative's name. 

In 2007, Cross herself became 
pregnant and wanted to have an abortion but decided to not have the 
procedure at the clinic, citing the unsanitary conditions.

Employee Latosha Lewis said 'one or 
two babies fell out of patients each night. They dropped on lounge 
chairs, on the floor, and often in the toilet.'

'If a baby was about to come out, I 
would take the woman to the bathroom, they would sit on the toilet and 
basically the baby would fall out and it would be in the toilet and I 
would be rubbing her back and trying to calm her down for two, three, 
four hours until Dr. Gosnell comes,” Lewis told the grand jury.

Gosnell preferred to have the babies 
fall out of their mother because 'it made his job easier,' according to a
Grand Jury report.

The report goes on to state: 'If fetuses had not 
precipitated, Gosnell would often have his staff physically push them 
out of their mothers by pressing in the mother’s abdomens.' 

The 2011 grand jury report blasts state
and city officials for failing to inspect or shutter Gosnell's busy 
clinic in West Philadelphia.

The 300-page grand jury report, that 
initially laid out the charges against Gosnell, details the appalling 
conditions of the West Philadelphia clinic the doctor operated.

It
was described as reeking of cat urine, with walls splattered with blood
and patient rooms filled with unsanitary instruments and broken- down 
equipment.

The tiny fetuses and many of their 
bodyparts were piled high throughout Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and 
freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, even cat-food containers.

Jars with severed feet lined shelves, prosecutors said. 'It was a baby charnel house,' the grand jury repor said.

Adrienne Moton, an employee at the 
clinic, then took the baby and snipped the back of its neck while the 
mother was still in the room.

Cross explained to the jury that the largest baby she saw was when Shayquana Abrams came into the clinic in July 2008.

Dr. Gosnell took the baby boy, which 
was described as around 12 to 18 inches long, and placed him into a 
plastic box about the size of a shoebox.

'The baby was still breathing, he didn’t cut the neck right there.' he said.

'I called people over to come see it and we took pictures,' she said.

The baby boy was in the fetal position and was laying on his side in the box.

The image of the baby taken by Cross was shown to the court.

She added that baby was supposed to be placed into a freezer but was still laying on the table the next day.

Gosnell later joked that the baby was so big he could have walked to the bus stop.

'Filthy': Investigators say Gosnell's clinic, the Women's Medical Society, catered to minorities, immigrants and poor women. It was also allegedly the site of unimaginable filth

Shayquana Abrams was 17 when she went to the Women’s Medical Society for a late-term abortion on July, 12, 2008. 

Earlier in the trial, Abrams testified that she was 29 weeks pregnant.

Abortions after 24 weeks are illegal in Pennsylvania.

Cross also testified that she witnessed Steven Massof, an unlicensed medical school graduate, snip babies necks  25 to 30 times and sometimes removed the brain through the opening.

Dr. Gosnell would cut the back of 
their necks with scissors, she said, but the doctor would simply announce 
the babies were not breathing.

Cross has pleaded guilty to federal drug
charges for administering medications at the clinic, and hopes to get 
probation for her cooperation.

Cross took photos of the clinic in 2008 because she had concerns.

Other photos shown in court depicted more than 50 jars filled with baby's feet.

Other pictures showed the clinic's 
cat roaming freely around the place including supposedly sterile 
procedure room along with the bathroom on the first and second floors.

Equipment in the clinic was also covered in blood.

The trial of Gosnell is currently in 
its fifth week. He is charged with, among other crimes, the first-degree
murder of seven babies who had been born alive during abortions and 
then killed after their spinal cords had been snipped.

The defense has denied that babies 
were born alive and will begin its case on Monday.
