A mother who is dying from cancer begged her council to let both her sons attend the same primary school - but had her request denied because she lives 100ft outside of the catchment area.

Michelle Amey, who was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2008 which has since spread all over her body, fears her family will struggle to cope with the strain of doing two school runs every day.

Her eldest son, nine-year-old Charlie, already attends Mudeford Junior School in Christchurch, Dorset.

Her younger son George, six, currently attends the attached infants' school, but despite appeals to Dorset County Council he will not be allowed to move.

Instead he will be forced to attend Somerford Primary School, which is even further away from the family's home in the town.

Mrs Amey and her husband Stuart, who are both 37, faced a gruelling appeals process from the council, who asked invasive questions about her cancer treatment and made Mr Amey feel as if he were 'on trial' for questioning their decision.

Mrs Amey fears the boys' 'extremely close' relationship will be but under strain if the two are separated.

She said: 'George and Charlie support each other, they’re there for each other a lot.

'They’re aware of my illness and symptoms and are very sensitive at the moment. I can’t face putting George in another school. He would be devastated.'

Mrs Amey claims the council’s ‘rules are rules’ attitude forced her to struggle on buses and on foot to do two separate school runs as her health deteriorated.

She fell ill shortly after George was born in 2008 and doctors confirmed a mole on her leg was malignant melanoma.

The deadly skin cancer spread to her groin and she required surgery and radiotherapy to bring the disease under control.

But the cancer has now spread to her brain, kidneys, lungs, liver and lymph nodes and since falling ill she has had four brain tumours removed, which means she cannot drive.

An appeal hearing with an independent panel dashed Mrs Amey’s hopes of her ‘extremely close’ boys being able to attend the same junior school.

She said: 'They made Stuart feel like he was under investigation, they were asking a lot about my health.

'When Stuart told them I’d received treatment for brain tumours, they would ask: "well what treatment exactly are you talking about?".

'They were extremely intrusive. He felt a bit like he was on trial - their attitude was really awful and it was basically rules are rules. It was like talking to a brick wall.’

Mr and Mrs Amey plan to write to Education Secretary Michael Gove, whom they will ask to intervene and allow their sons to attend school together.

Mrs Amey said: 'We’re hoping we can get the decision overturned. George is constantly asking whether we’ve got him a place at the junior school.

'His friends have had trial days and he’s missed out and with this on top of my illness, he’s very tearful.

'It’s just very, very difficult. I am fighting for my life but I am determined to fight for the boys to be together.

Together: Both boys wish to attend Mudeford junior school, where Charlie currently is. But George's appeal has been rejected

'Sometimes I can’t walk, I have severe joint pain and nausea - the symptoms are similar to chemotherapy.

'I don’t know when they are going to strike so the boys are like my little carers. They’ve had to grow up a bit quickly which is quite sad.'

Mr Amey used to work in investment banking, but gave his job up after his wife’s diagnosis.

He now works for The Honeypot Children’s Charity, allowing him more flexible hours to help take care of his wife and children.

Mrs Amey said: ‘Stuart is brilliant. He carries all the weight on his shoulders and tries to be strong all the time but it does get to him.

'The whole thing is so unnecessary, it’s just extra stress and pressure.'

A spokesman for Dorset County Council said: 'While we are unable to comment on individual cases, we can confirm that there was a recent appeals committee which reviewed several cases.

'The county council presented its case that Mudeford Junior School cannot take more than 33 children in each of its Year 3 classes entering in September 2014.

'Each family at the appeal presented their case for exceptional circumstances.

'The panel reviewed and made the decision that this particular case has been dealt with by Dorset County Council appropriately.

'We have been very sympathetic to this case. Those involved have gone beyond what is required to assist and support the family and we will continue to work with them.'
