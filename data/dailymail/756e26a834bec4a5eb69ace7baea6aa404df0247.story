If Arsenal fans at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday want a reminder of why they do not compete for titles any more they need only cast a glimpse at the home side's dugout.

Because sat there, barring a surprise selection from Manuel Pellegrini, will be a living, breathing symbol of their club's fall from heavyweights to makeweights.

Warming himself against the Manchester cold, Bacary Sagna will probably be spending another 90 minutes kicking his heels as the immovable Pablo Zabaleta goes about his business.

At this stage last season Sagna, regarded as one of the finest full backs in the country, had played 26 times for the Gunners.

This year he has featured in 11 matches for Manchester City, which include just five starts in the Premier League - almost as many appearances at the Etihad as his wife, Ludivine, has made judging by her Twitter and Instagram accounts.

From ever-present to ever-ready.

Will he be surprised? He should not be. Will he be upset? Who knows?

If he is ever feeling down he need only take a look at his monthly salary and the position of his team in the table.

Money talks in football and City have more of it than Arsenal.

When he completed his move, Sagna slammed those who claimed it was only for the cash before pointing out that, by the way, he hadn't had a pay rise at the Emirates in six years.

Figure that one out.

'I need a boost in my career,' he said.

Some boost. City were happy to offer a 31-year-old a three-year contract of a reported £150,000-a-week.

Arsenal were not.

That is one of the reasons why Pellegrini's side are vying with Chelsea for the title and why Arsene Wenger's men, once again, will be content with a top-four spot.

It may not all be about the money. Sagna will know that if he can muster 10 appearances in the Premier League he will be in with a chance of picking up a winners' medal. Zabaleta has had his injury issues in the past but the warrior-like defender, who turned 30 this week, appears to be in fine nick.

As for the Champions League, it is an even grimmer situation.

The arrival of Wilfried Bony means that one of City's registered players is going to have to make way and the smart money is on Sagna.

A sad, sad state of affairs.

Lest we forget Sagna is not the first. Following the arrival of Sheikh Mansour, Emmanuel Adebayor forged a path north. It soon became well-trodden, with Kolo Toure, Gael Clichy and Samir Nasri following his lead.

City know that to succeed at the highest level, you have to spend and spend big.

Pellegrini, before he had even started in England, knew that to sustain a serious title challenge he needed two quality players vying for each position.

Does Wenger, closing in on 18 years on these shores, agree?

If he does he has a funny way of showing it.

Nobody should deny Wenger's achievements and what he has done for the club. Winning with guile soon became winning with style. They should name the stadium his dealings pretty much paid for after him and cast the bronze for his statue.

Maybe Wenger will master his own French revolution. While splashing the cash on Mesut Ozil was a start, Alexis Sanchez has been a revelation. And nobody could predict that Sagna's replacement, Mathieu Debuchy, would be out for three months, come back for one game and then get injured and be out for another three months.

But the weak points go beyond right back and, while he may yet prove people wrong this window, the manager appears to be too stubborn to address them.

Fans scream for a central defender and on Friday he goes out and pays £4.2million for a 17-year-old Polish midfielder with six appearances under his belt.

Last season, when they came to Manchester top of the league, City hit them for six. Are Arsenal any better this time around?

At some point during proceedings there is little doubt the Etihad faithful will launch into a chant reminding the visitors that they are now their feeder club.

While it will be sung with Mancunian tongues planted firmly in cheeks, the sad fact of the matter is that they are not far wrong.
