Sean Rigg, 40, a paranoid schizophrenic, died in police custody after being 'unnecessarily' restrained in police custody. Today two officers have been arrested for perverting the course of justice in relation to Mr Rigg's inquest

Two Metropolitan Police policemen and a retired officer have been arrested on suspicion of perverting the court of justice by investigators probing the death of a musician in police custody.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission made the arrests following an investigation launched following a damning inquest last August which ruled that 40-year-old Sean Rigg died after officers used unnecessary force to restrain him.

The arrests are connected with evidence given at the inquest.

Mr Rigg's family had called for criminal charges to be brought against those responsible.

An IPCC spokesman today confirmed that an unnamed police Sergeant, 50, was arrested at work, a 29-year-old PC was arrested in South London and a retired PC, 48, was arrested by appointment at a London police station.

The spokesman added: 'All three are being questioned by IPCC investigators at a central London police station.

'IPCC investigators have carried out searches at their home addresses and the serving officers' workplaces.

'Mr Rigg's family have been told about today's developments through their solicitors.'

The inquest jury returned a scathing verdict about police actions, saying they contributed to the death of the musician while in custody at Brixton Police Station in south London.

The jury at Southwark Coroner's Court found that police used unsuitable and unnecessary force, with officers failing to uphold the detained man's basic rights as he collapsed after being pinned down for eight minutes.

Mr Rigg, who had paranoid schizophrenia, was living in a south London hostel in August 2008 as his mental health deteriorated.

He smashed up a gazebo at the hostel and made karate moves which staff saw as threatening. They called the police, who did not initially respond to several pleas for help.

Three hours after the first 999 call police responded, and three officers restrained Rigg.

The jury found that the Metropolitan Police made a catalogue of errors which 'more than minimally' contributed to his death.
