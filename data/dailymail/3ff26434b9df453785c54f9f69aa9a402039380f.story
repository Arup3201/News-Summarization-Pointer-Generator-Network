Neil Scarborough (pictured) has claimed he was having sexual relations with a police officer who was investigating him at the time

An undercover policewoman quit her job amid allegations she had an affair with a drug dealer she was investigating, it has emerged.

Neil Scarborough, 32, was jailed for 14 years in June after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis following a police probe which exposed a sophisticated drugs ring.

Scarborough was part of a gang which possessed heroin and cocaine worth £1.5m and more than £200,000 in cash.

He was arrested in 2011 and was among 36 men sentenced to a total of 167 years following a police probe called Operation Oak.

Scarborough, of Preston, Lancashire, says he believes the reason he was given such a long sentence is because of his relationship with the officer.

In a letter to his local paper, the Lancashire Evening Post, sent from his prison cell at HMP Altcourse, in Liverpool, Scarborough also claimed another Preston criminal was having a relationship with a second officer at the same time.

Lancashire Constabulary has confirmed two female officers were investigated over the claims six years ago.

But the allegations have only come to light publicly since Scarborough lost his appeal against his 14 year jail sentence in October.

He said: 'Myself and a friend were having sexual relations with two police officers, of which one of them was investigating me at the time.'

A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'Two female officers were investigated for misconduct but resigned in May 2007 before a hearing.'

Scarborough also claimed his sentence was tougher because he had been selling cocaine to disgraced solicitor Basharat Ditta, 44, from Blackburn, Lancashire.

Last month Ditta was jailed for three years after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice relating to passing on critical information to drug dealers, including Scarborough, about secret investigations into them.

He said: 'I feel that because of this I was given a longer sentence than I deserved, I am serving nearly 14 years.'

Scarborough was initially jailed for four years and three months in May 2007 shortly after £12,500 worth of cocaine was seized from one of his courier.

He was released in 2009 but carried on drug dealing - working with gangs based in Preston and Blackburn, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.

In 2011 a major police operation involving hundreds of officers saw a string of drug raids during which heroin and cocaine worth £1.5m was seized, along with more than £200,000 in cash.

Scarborough, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis, was one of 36 men jailed for a total of 167 years for their roles in the racket.
