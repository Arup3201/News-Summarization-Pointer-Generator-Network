Police are hunting racist thugs who broke into a mosque early this morning and scrawled Nazi swastikas on the walls and windows.

The vile graffiti was spotted at Redditch Central Mosque in Worcestershire by officers who were investigating reports of a break-in at the place of worship at 4.30am.

The yobs are believed to have broken into the site, which is under construction, some time after 2am  by forcing a gate before using paint from a builders' cabin to spray the hateful messages.

Police are hunting racist thugs who broke into a mosque early this morning and scrawled Nazi swastikas on the walls and windows

The vile graffiti was spotted at Redditch Central Mosque in Worcestershire by officers who were investigating reports of a break-in at the place of worship at 4.30am

The yobs are believed to have broken into the site, which is under construction, some time after 2am by forcing a gate before using paint from a builders' cabin to spray racist graffiti on walls and six windows

Police were guarding the mosque in Jinnah Road in Redditch as forensic examinations continued. 

It is not yet known if anything was stolen during the break-in.

Superintendent Kevin Purcell, from West Mercia Police, said: 'For as long as I can remember, the relationship between the Muslim community in Redditch, the police and the wider community would best be described as excellent.

'Due to incidents happening nationally, targeted patrols have been put in place and these will now be further increased as we will not tolerate mindless attacks of this nature.

'I will be arranging meetings with the chairs of the mosques, local civic leaders and the Independent Advisory Group to reassure them of our commitment and determination to do everything possible to prevent any further such incidents and track down those responsible for this attack.'

The majority of the graffiti was around the area that will become the main prayer room on the ground floor

Workmen prepare to remove the offensive daubings. This is not the first time the mosque has been targeted. An arson attack caused £3,000 of damage in July 2006

The racist graffiti is not the first time the mosque has been targeted. An arson attack caused £3,000 of damage in July 2006.

Arsonists were also blamed for another fire, which which was set at the front door of the mosque last January.

No one was injured and there was no major damage to the building in the 2012 attack but police treated both incidents as arson.

Rafaqat Hussain, chairman of Redditch Central Mosque, 
said there was so much graffiti it was like the thugs had 'gone through 
the racist handbook'.

Speaking outside the £2.5million mosque, which is due to open later this year with a capacity for 1,400 worshippers, Mr Hussain, 41, vowed not to be intimidated by the attackers

Six windows of the mosque were daubed in
blue paint with the initials 'EDL', 'KKK' and 'NF' (National Front) as 
well as crudely drawn swastikas.

Yobs also scrawled the word 'Paki' on the walls of the prayer room.

Speaking outside the £2.5million 
mosque, which is due to open later this year with a capacity for 1,400 
worshippers, Mr Hussain, 41, vowed not to be intimidated 
by the attackers.

He said: 'To be honest, I think whoever had done this has done it to cause fear and problems in the community.

'It looks like it was a break-in and 
then obviously they broke into the mosque and put onto the walls and 
windows some quite disturbing racist remarks.

'There are quite a few racist slogans on there like EDL and Paki and KKK and the swastikas.

'It's like they've gone through the racist's handbook.

'Fortunately nobody was hurt or in at the time because it is a building site and is still under construction. 

'But Redditch is a very tight community -
we have never had problems like this so hopefully we will get over this
and the work's not going to stop.

'The police have done a wonderful job and it was them who spotted it.

'The community is all here cleaning up and helping us. We've got people from the council and local police officers helping,' said Mr Hussain

'It doesn't matter what religion, we are all one community.'

Mr Hussain said the majority of the 
racist graffiti was on the walls and windows of what will become the 
main prayer room on the ground floor.

The attack comes just five days after 
detectives in Walsall, West Midlands, launched a major hate-crime 
investigation when a small home-made bomb exploded near a mosque.

Around 150 people were evacuated from 
their homes in the Caldmore area of the town on Saturday night while 
bomb disposal experts made the device safe.

West Midlands Police said a loud bang 
heard by residents late on Friday 'appeared to be consistent' with the 
device exploding. No one was injured and it caused minimal damage.

The remains of the device were found in 
an alleyway adjoining the Aisha Mosque and Islamic Centre in Rutter 
Street on Saturday by a local man who took them home and showed them to 
his wife.

The mosque's imam also took them home later before anyone realised their significance.

Both incidents happened in the wake of a
number of similar instances at mosques following the murder of Drummer 
Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London on May 22.

Last week, two men were charged in 
relation to an alleged arson at a mosque in Gloucester, and an Islamic 
cultural centre in Grimsby was hit by petrol bombs last month.

Mosques in Braintree, Essex, and Gillingham, Kent, have also been targeted.
