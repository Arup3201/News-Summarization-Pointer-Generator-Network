It can tell you what you want to eat in the blink of an eye, simply by tracking the movement of your retina.

In exactly 2.5 seconds the subconscious menu reads the minds of customers, by using a  mathematical algorithm to identify a customer's perfect pizza.

The incredible software was developed for Pizza Hut  by Swedish eye tracking technology pioneers Tobii Technology.

Pizza Hut's subconscious menu reads the minds of diners by using sophisticated eye tracking technology

Taking six months to build, the menu is completely controlled by the customer's retina.

The four-step process starts when the software detects the users retina and gaze by asking customers to randomly look at different circles. 

Eye movements are tracked against the small marks on the screen. 

The software then detects the gaze of the user by changing the logos on the interface from big to small. 

This is then followed by ingredients tracking, where the user is given three seconds to look at 20 ingredients on the screen.

The algorithm then kicks in and the  menu identifies the perfect pizza based on which ingredients the user has been looking at the longest.

Linger over peppers and sweet corn; the customer will be served a vegetarian pizza. If the user is of a more carnivorous persuasion and holds a longer gaze towards pepperoni and chicken then the meat feast is offered as an option.

If customers aren't happy with what their subconscious has decided, they can restart the process by gazing at the 'restart' button.

Chartered consumer psychologist Dr Simon Moore says our subconscious plays an important role in the foods we decide to eat.

'We have quite an extensive subconscious relationship with our food and it's certainly the case psychologically that 'we eat with our eyes,' he said.

'Quick brain responses are probably hardwired to our evolutionary survival reflex. We are automatically drawn to foods that give us more nutrition– it is a safety mechanism we've inherited from primitive man that still plays a role in our subconscious decision making, even when we might be choosing pizza.'

Kathryn Austin Head of Marketing at Pizza Hut Restaurant said: 'We love to excite and innovate. We wanted to try a few ideas on the traditional menu format and we're delighted to have developed the world's first Subconscious Menu, a unique way to reinvent the dining experience.'
