The White House struggled on Tuesday to defend Colleen Bell, President Barack Obama's choice for U.S. ambassador to Hungary.

Bell, a top Obama reelection campaign bundler and a producer of the soap opera The Bold And The Beautiful, was confirmed today without a single Republican vote in the last window of opportunity for Democrats to approve such 'patronage' appointments before the GOP takes over the Senate in January.

Pressed to explain Bell's qualifications for the diplomatic position, the president's spokesman was unable to speak in specifics this afternoon, eventually citing her experience in the private sector as the reason she was selected.

Uhhh: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was unable to list a single real reason Bell is qualified to represent the country abroad during his daily press briefing at the White House this afternoon

The president is not technically allowed to use government jobs as rewards for his top donors, and when he was first elected, Obama promised to 'limit' his own abuse of the privilege. But like every modern president before him, Obama's frequently engaged in the practice anyway. 

By the American Foreign Service Association's count, 41 percent of current U.S. ambassadors were picked for their positions as a political courtesy while 58.6 percent were longtime diplomats. 

Touching on this today, ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, 'what are Colleen Bell's qualifications for ambassador?'

'Was it that she was a soap opera producer, is it that she gave hundreds of thousands of dollars - or helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars - for the Obama reelection campaign? Why was she chosen?' he pondered.

Earnest hemmed and hawed before describing Bell as 'somebody who retains the confidence that, well, let me say it this way: Ambassador Bell has the president's confidence that she will do an excellent job representing the U.S. and maintaining the important relationship the U.S. has with the government and the people of Hungary.'

Not letting it go, Karl asked him 'where does the president get that confidence from?'

'I mean, in her confirmation hearing she couldn't even name a single strategic interest the U.S. had with Hungary,' he pointed out.

'Well, she certainly is somebody, again, that is, has had her own distinguished private sector career,' Earnest responded, to which Karl again pointed out that her only real business experience was work as a soap opera producer.'

Trying again, the White House spokesman she is 'somebody who obviously has succeeded in the business world and she is somebody that the president has confidence will be able to maintain our relationship with the government and the people of Hungary.'

Bell has worked on the Bold and the Beautiful off and on since 1991 in a variety of production positions. She left the show for a decade in 2000 and returned in 2012 as as an associate producer. The next year she was promoted to the producer spot. 

Today she was approved by the Senate 52-42 to serve as the next ambassador to the fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization member state, despite the strong objections of Arizona Sen. John McCain.

'We're about to vote on a totally unqualified individual to be ambassador to a nation which is very important to our national security interest,' McCain said from the Senate floor.

'Her qualifications are as a producer of the television soap opera The Bold and The Beautiful, contributed 800,000 [dollars] to Obama in the last election and bundled more than $2.1 million for President Obama's re-election effort,' he continued.

Political consultant Noah Bryson Mamet was also confirmed as a U.S. ambassador today despite admitting during a confirmation hearing earlier this year that he has never actually been to that country he will now serve as a representative to, Argentina

Arizona Sen. John McCain, pictured here talking to reporters this afternoon after party caucus luncheons at the U.S. Capitol, urged his colleagues today not to confirm Bell. 'Her qualifications are as a producer of the television soap opera The Bold and The Beautiful,' he said on the Senate floor

'I am not against political appointees…I understand how the game is played,' he said, 'but here we are, a nation [Hungary] that is on the verge of ceding its sovereignty to a neo-fascist dictator getting in bed with Vladimir Putin and we're going to send the producer of The Bold and The Beautiful as the ambassador.

Continuing, McCain asked his colleagues to 'put a stop to this foolishness' by voting no.

McCain had grilled Bell during her confirmation hearing on what she would do differently from her predecessor to improve relations with the country. She was unable to articulate an answer before he moved on. 

Also approved by the Senate today was Noah Mamet, who will serve as the U.S. ambassador to Argentina. Senate Democrats gave him the job by a vote of 50-43, even though the Democratic fundraiser admitted during his confirmation hearing that he'd never even been to the South American country.

Mamet raised at least half a million dollars for for Obama's reelection campaign in 2012, according to the Center for Public Integrity, and was on his national finance committee.

After Mamet's confirmation proceedings earlier this year the American Foreign Service Association, a labor union for career diplomats, trolled both the political operative and Bell by putting out a list of basic skills that all ambassadors should have.

'Now, let’s be clear, someone who is a big donor, but who is also a person with a lot of international experience, that speaks foreign languages – that person can potentially qualify,' the group's president, Robert Silverman, told U.S. News at the time.

'It’s not a disqualifier in and of itself,' he added, 'but if that’s the only reason that person is being nominated for all we could tell, then that person should not be qualified.'
