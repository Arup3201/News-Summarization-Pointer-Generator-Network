A top young footballer has been jailed after his flea-infested dog was found starving to death in her own filth.

Cruel ex-Ipswich Town Academy midfielder Cy Whitham, 20, was locked up for 18 weeks yesterday and banned from keeping animals for 15 years.

A veteran RSPCA inspector told South East Suffolk magistrates' court in Ipswich it was arguably the worst case he had ever seen.

KD weighed less than 20lbs when she was found. A healthy weight would be 42lbs

Whitham, of Defoe Road, Ipswich, admitted two 
counts of causing unnecessary suffering and two charges of failing in 
his duty to ensure an animal's welfare.

Whitham's mother Millie Whitham, 47, who lived with him, admitted the same charges.

Hugh
Rowland, prosecuting, said the footballer's horrifically thin 
Staffordshire Bull Terrier, called KD, was found shut in a bedroom at their former home on Donegal Road, surrounded by her own faeces and urine.

The Whithams moved out of their housing association owned property in Donegal Road on September 3, more than three weeks before KD was found.

Emaciated KD was found when a 
pest controller was sent to the Whithams' filthy house on September 26 
to tackle a flea infestation.

The Bull Terrier ran out out of a bedroom and downstairs. Millie Whitham said she had run out of money to feed her pet.

She claimed she last fed the dog a week after moving out. The bodies of two other decomposed dogs were also discovered in a shed at the property.

RSPCA Inspector Jason Finch estimated the dogs' corpses could have been rotting for one month and said they were too decomposed to identify their breed or their cause of death.

But the Whithams both denied any involvement with the dead dogs found at their former home.

Three-year-old KD was just under 20lbs when she should have weighed over double that, about 42lbs, the court heard.

Mr Rowland said malnourished KD was dehydrated, starving, wracked with pain and crawling with fleas.

After seeing pictures of the starved dog, chairman of the bench, Diana Hunt, said: 'It's amazing it's still alive, isn't it?'

Mr Rowland said KD must have suffered terribly for weeks and was very close to death when she was rescued.

Inspector Finch, who has for the RSPCA for 13 years, said he could not recall seeing an animal in such a wretched condition.

Brave KD, who has been renamed Lottie, is now doing well in the hands of the RSPCA and has made a successful recovery from her ordeal, magistrates heard.

Inspector Finch said: 'When the pest controller opened the door, Lottie came 
straight out and immediately started trying to scavenge for food or 
anything that she could eat.

'He gave Lottie a couple of biscuits and called us straight away. When I saw her I couldn’t believe she was still alive, the poor girl looked like a bag of bones.'

'When we found her she weighed just 9.2kg, but she should have weighed between 18kg and 20kg.

'Thankfully she’s made a fantastic recovery in our care and now weighs nearly 17kg.'

Both mother and son Cy admitted they could have done more to look after their dog.

Their solicitor, Neil Saunders, said: 'There is little mitigation here. It must have been obvious the dog was suffering.

'The condition of the house was dire having read the papers, but that is probably part and parcel of why there are carers involved.

'It's neglect over what must have been a considerable time. I can't really mitigate on this because the pictures say it all.'

Referring to Cy Whitham, Mr Saunders added: 'There's no room for manoeuvre here. That dog suffered because of him.'

Cy Whitham was jailed as his mother's sentencing was adjourned until February 5. Ipswich Town Academy, where Whitham played as midfielder, were unavailable for comment.
