Gary Neville and Paul Scholes are not the kind to blindly toe the party line when it comes to big-money Manchester United signings.

The pair of club greats cast doubt on the suitability of Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata when each arrived in consecutive transfer windows.

So when both are united in their view that Angel Di Maria is an ideal purchase for Louis van Gaal as he tries to re-energise his team, their words carry value.

On his way: Angel Di Maria (right) looks set for a move to Manchester United

Wrong man? For all his talent, the Argentine winger is unlikely to be the answer to United's problems

Neville went on Twitter to affirm ‘Di Maria fits the bill for United 100%…’ while Scholes used his column with the Independent to highlight the Argentine as one of five signings required immediately.

Who could argue with players so knowledgeable and forthright in their views? But watching United continue their slump into mediocrity during the 1-1 draw at Sunderland it was clear some rudimental issues need addressing urgently.

Di Maria, at only 26 and with a wealth of experience, will bring plenty to United but is he another cherry on top of a cake that is only half-baked?

If Van Gaal is to persist with his 3-5-2 formation, significant holes need filling at the foundation of his team: centre back and central midfield. That latter position has been one crying out for serious investment for years, while the former has increased in importance with Van Gaal’s tactical switch and the departure of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand.

At the Stadium of Light Phil Jones, Tyler Blackett and Chris Smalling started in defence, with Michael Keane arriving after Smalling’s injury.

Wanted: Arturo Vidal (right) could help to fill a void in the centre of United's midfield

Competition: Juan Mata's (centre) spot in the United first team could be under threat with the arrival of Di Maria

Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley began in the middle of the park. Just how many Van Gaal would happily field in a team supposedly chasing the Champions League is open to question.

Blackett and Keane are two academy graduates aged 20 and 21 who have shown promise through the youth ranks at United. But to thrust responsibility on them during this uncertain period for the club would not be Van Gaal’s preference.

Yes the Dutchman is famed for bringing through young talents in a manner that allies United’s history – but not in this band-aid fashion.

In 1995/96 when Sir Alex Ferguson won the double with Scholes and Neville and some other decent kids, his central defenders were Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister, aged 30 and 35 respectively.

The rapid promotion of Blackett and Keane has been through necessity rather than desire and that is unhealthy. Experience counts in that area of the pitch and without Jonny Evans there is paucity in leadership and organisation.

Mats Hummels would bring those qualities instantly but looks likely to stay at Borussia Dortmund, while Thomas Vermaelen has gone to Barcelona. Marcos Rojo should provide a lift but a defender of presence is desperately needed. If ever Jones and Smalling were to prove worth the hype and combined outlay of £26m it is now.

In central midfield, dynamism and a defensive screen has been missing since Roy Keane left. Injuries curtailed Owen Hargreaves and Ferguson never did promote or purchase a player to take the mantle.

Manchester City have Fernandinho or Fernando, Chelsea have Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas, Liverpool have Steven Gerrard and now Emre Can. United must go out and put some oil in the engine room. 

Trust: Van Gaal is giving youth a chance, but has placed a lot of pressure on the likes of Tyler Blackett (above)

Bad start: United suffered an opening day Premier League defeat at the hands of Swansea

Stuggle: Van Gaal's side could only manager a 1-1 draw against Sunderland on Sunday 

It was interesting Van Gaal elected to namedrop Arturo Vidal when asked about Di Maria post Sunderland. Supporters salivated. The Chilean would add that steel sought for so long.

Quite where Di Maria would fit remains to be seen. It could be he plays in one of two midfield roles, it could be Van Gaal disposes with his new system. It appears unlikely Di Maria has been ear-marked for a wing back slot.

He was man-of-the-match playing as part of a three-man midfield for Real Madrid in the Champions League final and brings pace, drive, and cutting edge; ingredients absent from United’s performances to date.

But his potential £75m move now needs to be part of a spree that ends with at least two arrivals of substance, not just sugar.
