Uganda has been revealed as the most ethnically mixed country on the planet according to a new scientific study that blows apart misconceptions that western nations are the most racially diverse.

Academics at Harvard University's Institute for Economic Research spent a painstaking 11 years studying 650 different ethnic groups across 190 countries.

Using data from sources including 
national censuses, Encyclopedia Brittanica, the CIA, Minority Rights 
Group International and a 1998 study called 'Ethnic Groups Worldwide', 
scientists gave each country.

Using that data, they worked out an 'ethnicity rating' for each country based on the question: If you picked two people at random in any nation and asked them their ethnicity, what are the chances that they would give a different answer?

And as this map shows, it has thrown up some rather unexpected results.

Surprising? This map shows the planet's most and least ethnically diverse nations in the world. The countries in green are the most diverse, while those in red are the least

Uganda is home to more than 40 different indigenous ethnic groups, including the Baganda, Iteso, Basoga and Banyankore - all of which have their own languages, cultures and customs.

While the East African nation tops the list, at the bottom came South Korea which was classed the world's most homogenous nation.

But
 perhaps what will prove most surprising to some, Europe is revealed as 
the least ethnically diverse continent on the planet, with the UK and 
France as two of the most.

The revelation will stick with certain right-wing 
political parties who claim that mass immigration has diluted indigenous culture and custom and left their societies with little or no tangible sense of national identity.

At the other end of the scale, Africa is exposed as the world's most racially diverse continent. Indeed, the top 20 most diverse nations in the world are all in Africa.

Top and bottom:  While Uganda, left, tops the list, at the bottom came South Korea, right, which was classed the world's most homogenous nation

Meanwhile, the US came almost exactly in the middle with Canada ranked more diverse than its southern neighbour.

The study comes after the global social attitudes study
 claimed that the most racially intolerant populations are all in the 
developing world, with Bangladesh, Jordan and India in the top five.

By contrast, the study of 80 countries over three decades found Western countries were most accepting of other cultures with Britain, the U.S., Canada and Australia more tolerant than anywhere else.
