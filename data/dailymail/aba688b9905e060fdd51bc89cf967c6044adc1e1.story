A TV football presenter says she was told to leave the side of the pitch on a number of occasions because she was distracting the players by being too attractive.  

Katarina Sreckovic, who hosts a show about Serbia's Red Star Belgrade, told how players initially struggled to answer her questions because the young men couldn't concentrate in her presence.

The 25-year-old, who has studied Chinese and literature, said she feared for her future in what she described as her 'dream job' but the players appear to have got over it.

'I admit it was a problem at the start but I think they've got used to me now,' she said. 'It was tough though because for a while it seemed as if they might not be able to work with me at all.

'I was also asked to go away a couple of times because I was a distraction on the pitch, and players complained that they couldn't concentrate.'

Sreckovic says she is a huge fan of Red Star, who won the European Cup in 1991, as is her boyfriend - who is not a footballer.

While going through a period of financial trouble Red Star remains a powerhouse in the Serbian SuperLiga alongside city rivals Partizan - their matches are referred to as 'the Eternal Derby'.

Adding to their hard times, Red Star were excluded from the Champions League for the 2014/15 season due to a breach in UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations.

The club was found by European football's Club Financial Control Body to have numerous overdue payments to employees and other clubs.
