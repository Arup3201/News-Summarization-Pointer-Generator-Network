Hamid Karzai has blasted NATO’s military actions in Afghanistan, claiming that his country has not seen anything but suffering and loss of lives.

The departing president also said the alliance’s airstrikes were a ‘violation against our sovereignty’, which has provoked angry responses from several camps.

The war on terror in Afghanistan, which entered its 12th year yesterday, has claimed the lives of more than 2,270 US soldiers and 440 British troops.

Attack: President Hamid Karzai has said the NATO exercise in Afghanistan has caused 'a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, and no gains'

Responding to Saturday’s airstrike in Nangarhar province, where the Karzai government claim five civilians were killed, he attacked the military coalition’s actions in Afghanistan.

‘They commit their violations against our sovereignty and conduct raids against our people, air raids and other attacks in the name of the fight on terrorism and in the name of the resolutions of the United Nations. This is against our wishes,’ Karzai said.

His critique of NATO continued as he branded the organisations 12 years in Afghanistan a failure in an interview with the BBC.

‘On the security front the entire NATO exercise was one that caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, and no gains because the country is not secure,’ he told Newsnight in an appearance marking the six-month countdown until he leaves office.

In the interview he accused NATO on focusing their war against terrorism on Afghan villages instead of Taliban and al-Qaeda bases in neighbouring Pakistan.

Hitting back: Former Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, seen here with Karzai during a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Kabul, has branded the president's attack on NATO 'unfair'

Following his attack on the organisation, NATO’s former Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, hit back at Karzai's critique, calling it 'unfair' to the soldiers who have lost their lives to protect a country not their own.

'It's unfair to all those NATO soldiers who lost their lives. It's unfair to Great Britain, responsible for one of the most - if not the most - complicated part of Afghanistan, Helmand, where I've been many times and where I've seen them and learned to appreciate very much what they've done.

'So now, at the end of the day, to say this was all a failure is unfair and I very much disagree with the statement he's making,’ Mr de Hoop Scheffer, who headed the organisation for five years until 2009, said.

Michael Semple, former deputy to the 
European Union special representative for Afghanistan said Karzai’s 
comments show that he is 'out of touch with many of the people in 
Afghanistan'.

'Perhaps he 
believes it, but when I talk to Afghans, they tend to be polite, they're
well aware of the sacrifices that have been involved in the 
international mission in Afghanistan - they prefer to say thank you and 
they feel rather appalled at the prospect of somebody saying: "No, that 
didn't work at all, terrible disaster."'

Positive thinking: President Barack Obama is 'optimistic' about securing a deal for future actions in Afghanistan

Afghan civil society activist Orzala Ashraf Nemat branded Karzai 'very weak' when he opened up to the possibility of Taliban taking positions in the Afghan government.

The president rubbished claims that involving the Taliban in decision making would have a negative effect on advances in women's rights.

'I am confident that things are not going to return, but I am not confident about President Karzai's assurances,' she said.

'My confidence comes from the dedication and determination of Afghan women, who will probably continue to struggle regardless of what situation we face in the future.'

Meanwhile, the US is ‘optimistic’ that an agreement between the two countries over the future of NATO troops in the country will be finalised within the next few weeks.

The US government has said it wants as many as 10,000 troops to remain after 2014 in order to eradicate the remnants of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.

However, as talks resumed yesterday after a four month hiatus, it is still possible the two sides will not agree.

There currently are an estimated 87,000 international troops in Afghanistan, including about 52,000 Americans.

On Friday, President Barack Obama said he would consider keeping some American forces on the ground after the conflict formally ends next year, but acknowledged that doing so would require an agreement.

He suggested that if no agreement can be reached, he would be comfortable with a full pullout of U.S. troops.
