Only the most prestigious of museums could boast of having the work of Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio and Henry Wallis in just one room.

But for 66-year-old Mike Rome, his one-bedroom flat in Bristol is home to uncanny copies of masterpieces including the Mona Lisa and The Girl With a Pearl Earring.

Mr Rome paints hundreds of replicas of some of the worlds greatest paintings and signs them with his own name. Before starting a painting, the retired graphic designer visits the gallery where the original is displayed.

Capturing the smile: Art critics and students have marveled over Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa's mysterious half-smile. Mike Rome took a picture of the masterpiece (right) and created his own copy (left) from his flat in Bristol

Uncanny: Despite the brighter colours and slightly larger earring, Mike Rome's copy (left) is an enchanting version of the real deal (right) by Johannes Vermeer

Untrained: 66-year-old Mike Rome makes copies of great works of art and sells them for up to £1,200. He said: 'They are not fakes as I put my own signature on them.' The retired graphic designer spends up to three hours a day painting

He takes a photo of the painting and replicates the image from his studio at home. His copies have been displayed in galleries and bought for up to £1,200 each.

Mr Rome has made copies of Victorious Cupid, The Lady With An Ermine and The Lady of
Shalott in an effort to improve his craft.

The 66-year-old said that making replicas is a method of honing his skills because he is not formally trained.

'I started it as a means of improving my skills. Trying
to replicate something someone has done that's well known is a good 
way. You are always looking to improve and, maybe, when I'm 80, I'll get
there.'

Mr Rome started selling the paintings in 2005 and spends up to three hours working on them each day. He said he began working seriously as an artist when he relocated to Bristol after his wife of 40 years Pam died.

Practise makes perfect: Mr Rome, who has no formal art training, said making replicas of paintings such as Lady With An Ermine (right) is helping him become a better painter. He said: 'I started it as a means of improving my skills.'

Bolder and brighter: Most of Mike Rome's versions (left) use more vibrant colours than the originals. He has recreated Henry Wallis' the Death of Chatterton (right) from 1856 with a brighter tone

Detailed: The intricate work on John William Waterhouse's Lady Of Shallot has been copied by Mr Rome (left). He said he took up painting when he relocated to Bristol after his wife died

'Painting
helps me with the bereavement. I moved away from the south coast 
because my wife died and the art helps me through it.'

The widower said he has never studied art, but his talent for illustration was spotted when he worked as an apprentice in an engineers office. 

'They noticed I was good at drawing so they moved me 
into the sketching office.'

Mr Rome said he has sold between 50 and 60 paintings so far. He said: 'It is not just the classics, I paint 
whatever takes my fancy. All of the paintings are oil and the majority 
are on canvas.

'It
takes time to build up your reputation, and I have been moving around 
quite a bit, so I am hoping I'll be able to sell a few more in the 
future.

'I have already had my worked showcased with a few galleries and am now looking for more opportunities to get my art displayed.

Lucrative: As well as having his work on display in galleries, Mr Rome's paintings sell for up to £1,200

Adjustment: In some of the recreations, Mr Rome has made some changes. His version of Caravaggio's Victorious Cupid (left) is considerably more covered up than the original (right)

Demand: Mr Rome said he has sold about 60 copies of some of the world's greatest pieces of art, including Francois Boucher's Reclining Girl
