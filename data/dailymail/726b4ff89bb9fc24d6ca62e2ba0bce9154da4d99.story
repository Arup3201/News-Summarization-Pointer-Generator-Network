The mother of an Oklahoma man claims her son had to have half his skull removed after a local jail refused to treat his sinus infection while he was incarcerated for petty theft.

Robby Valentine has been hospitalized for the past three months after the untreated sinus infection spread out of control.

His mother Sandy plans to file a lawsuit against the county and the jail and she claims her son wasn't given proper medical treatment.

Valentine's illness started while he was imprisoned in the county jail but when he complained about not feeling well all they gave him was ibuprofen

'He can't talk. He can't walk. He can't tell you how he feels,' Sandy Valentine told KFOR.

Robby's infection began while he was in jail and spread because he didn't get the treatment he needed. As a result, doctors had to remove almost half of his skull.

'He asked for medical attention, and they gave him ibuprofen,' Valentine said. 'I knew he needed antibiotics. I knew he needed medical treatment, and he wasn't getting it.'

Robby has a criminal record with multiple arrests, but family attorneys said his medical care is a civil rights issue, not a criminal matter.

'The county, the jail needs to provide (medical care). If that's not happening, then it's something that needs to be addressed,' said Brian Buswell, an attorney for the family.

The county jail at the center of the case hasn't been named due to the pending litigation.

Robby, who was arrested in July, remains hospitalized at Norman Regional Hospital.

Robby Valentine was arrested on July 21 2014 when the name he gave authorities was Robert Allen Autry
