One of three suspects accused in the murder of an Aspen socialite has been cleared of all criminal charges in light of new evidence.

The 9th Judicial District Attorney’s Office on Tuesday dropped first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and accessory after the fact to murder charges against 62-year-old Nancy Styler.

According to a press release put out by District Attorney Sherry Caloia, the decision to clear Styler in the murder case came after her office was presented last week with new evidence, but she did not elaborate in the statement on the nature of this evidence.

Styler, her husband, William Styler, 66, and Katherine Carpenter, 56, have been arrested in connection to the murder of Nancy Pfister, whose body was found in a closet at her home in February. 

‘With the new information received and a lack of other evidence refuting the new information the district attorney could not prove that Ms. Styler was involved in the crimes,’ the DA said in the release to Aspen Times.

Following a court hearing Tuesday evening, Mrs Styler was freed from Eagle County Jail, where she had been incarcerated without bond since her arrest in March.

Her husband and Carpenter, who was the victim’s friend and bookkeeper, remained behind bars.William Styler is scheduled to appear in court for a status hearing on Friday.

Nancy Styler’s attorney Garth McCarty said after the hearing that his client is happy to be exonerated, and hopes the charges being dropped helps bring some closure to the victim's family.

The Stylers' arrest affidavits that were unsealed last week showed that police found nine blood spots inside the couple's Jaguar, ABC News reported.

The murder weapon was discovered in a trash bag not far from Nancy and William Stylers' hotel room.

Nancy Pfister, 57, was hit with a hard object that had a small, curved shape and died from a blunt force trauma to the head, according to the coroner's report released in April. 

She had been dead about 36 hours before her body was found on February 26.

William and Nancy Styler, who had rented Pfister's Aspen home while she was in Australia, were arrested March 3 after moving out of the residence February 22.

Katherine Carpenter, 56, an assistant to Pfister and a bank employee, was arrested March 14.

Authorities said she called 911 to report she found Pfister's body in a closet of the home.

Pfister
 was the daughter of the late Betty and Art Pfister, longtime prominent 
Aspen residents who co-founded the Buttermilk ski area west of town. 
Buttermilk Mountain has hosted the Winter X Games multiple times.

Pfister's death was the first homicide case in Pitkin County in 12 years, not counting those classified as murder-suicides.

Pfister wrote on Facebook on February 3 
that 'the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not 
doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they 
haven't paid utilities'.

Over the years, Pfister had paid 
Carpenter, an employee at two Alpine bank branches in Aspen, to manage 
her property and to walk her dog, Gabe, who came with the $4,000-a-month
 lease.

On February 6, 
Pfister posted on Facebook that she was looking for new tenants and that
 anyone interested should contact Carpenter.

Ms Pfister, pictured left with her daughter Juliana, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent

She subsequently returned from Australia and, days later, was found dead by Carpenter.

Juliana Pfister attended those 
proceedings surrounded by friends, telling ABC News that she couldn't 
believe someone would kill her fun-loving mother because of an alleged 
rent dispute.

'How could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house?' she said.

'There's got to be something more. It's hard to understand that.'

Investigators spent weeks at Pfister's house, removing many boxes and files as evidence.
