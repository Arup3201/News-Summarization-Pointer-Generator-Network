A Canadian teen who stabbed his girlfriend more than 100 times because he claimed she cheated on him has been sentenced to life in prison while expressing no remorse for his crime.

Melvin Skeete Jr., now 18, was sentenced as an adult on Monday a little more than two years after slaying 17-year-old Brittany Green in his grandfather's Nova Scotia home in December 2010.

The Cape Breton teen, 16 at the time of the murder, was allegedly found by a witness standing over the girl’s mutilated body saying, ‘I had to. She cheated on me. I had to kill her.’

After found guilty of second-degree murder in August, Skeete rose to his feet on Monday yelling obscenities at the victim's family, police and the judge following his upgraded sentence as an adult in a youth court in Sydney.

'You guys ain’t gonna break me,' he shouted, according to the Chronicle Herald. 'I’ll still be smilin’.'

An autopsy revealed that Miss Green was first bludgeoned by Skeete before she was stabbed 104 times using four knives during a night of drinking. Two knives he left in her side, one of which was found broken off.

Skeete, who was first obtained by a police officer while walking down a road near the home, was found under the influence of drugs and alcohol.

'She was such a good person. It’s not 
right, and to mutilate her body like that, no,' the girl's grandmother, 
Theresa Brewster, told the Cape Brenton Post, her voice breaking into a 
sob. 'He took so much away from us. He took Brittany.'

Skeete,
who had been in and out of trouble since the age of 12 according to 
government and social service agencies, was found guilty in August 
during his judge-only trial.

‘I’m sure everyone else is very happy that he gets what he deserves,’ Miss Green's best friend Tiffany Steele reacted to the Post of his sentence. ‘He had so many chances and he blows it every time. He always goes back to the old him and I think he’s always going to.’

Crown prosecutor Steve Drake says Skeete will be eligible for parole on Dec. 3, 2017. He will have a life-time weapons band and must also provide a sample for the national DNA database.

At the request of the victim's family, 
Judge Anne Derrick lifted the publication ban on the names of the victim
and perpetrator in the case.

'We wanted people to know it's Melvin Skeete who did it to her, that's the main reason,' Miss Green's uncle, Raymond Brewster, told CBC.

If sentenced has a youth he would have potentially served just four years behind bars and three years in the community.

If receiving credit for time already served, with that sentence he'd have been back on the street within two years.

Derrick ruled that a youth sentence would have neither held Skeete fully accountable for his grisly crime nor would it provide enough time for him to be rehabilitated.

‘F***k these people, man,’ Skeete said as he was led out of the courtroom on Monday. ‘F***k the judge, f**k the police, f**k the system.’

The defence did not return a message seeking comment.
