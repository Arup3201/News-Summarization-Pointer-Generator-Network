Three American teachers are part of a group of ten finalists from across the world who could win $1million dollars and a title that's considered to be the Nobel Prize of teaching.

The winner of the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize, which is awarded to a teacher for his or her efforts in promoting global citizenship in the classroom, will be announced on Sunday in Dubai.  

Aside from committing to being a teacher for at least five more years, the winner can spend the $1million on whatever they'd like.  

The three American finalists together have almost 75 years of experience in classrooms, according to USA Today. 

Nancie Atwell, 63, is an English and writing teacher in Maine. She founded a private demonstration school in Edgecomb and is the author of nine books. She began teaching in 1973. 

Naomi Volain, 56, is a high school science teacher in Springfield, Massachusetts. Though she was originally a nutritionist - then a medical copywriter - her hands-on lessons in environmental science and outdoor education during her 17 years of teaching have won much praise.

Nancie Atwell, 63, is an English and writing teacher in Maine. She founded an experimental private demonstration school in Edgecomb for kindergarteners through eighth graders in 1990

Stephen Ritz, 52, is an elementary school teacher in New York City's South Bronx area. He created a low-cost and portable gardening and nutrition program which led him and his students to install more than 100 gardens throughout New York. 

Atwell said she's 'convinced that teaching language arts is one of the great careers', because it's 'demanding', but also 'meaning-filled' and 'interesting'. 

She said: 'I get to demonstrate what is possible, teach what is useful, establish conditions that invite engagement, support the hard work of literary reading and writing, and enjoy the kinds of relationships with adolescents that drew me to education in the first place. 

'Because my students select the books they read and the subjects they write about, I'm able to help them discover what reading and writing are good for, here and now and in their literate lives to come. 

'There is nothing more important than putting the right book in a child's hands at the right time.'

Atwell founded the Center for Teaching and Learning in 1990, which uses experimental teaching methods on students in kindergarten through eighth grade. 

She built an 'excellent classroom library',  in hopes of letting her own students discover what they wanted to read on their own.

'I worry that educational bureaucrats have a problem with pleasure,' she told USA Today, 'that if kids are enjoying what they're doing, it can't be rigorous or worthwhile.'

If Atwell wins the prize, she said she will donate 'every penny' to the Center for Teaching and Learning. 

Naomi Volain, 56, is a high school science teacher in Springfield, Massachusetts. She has been a teacher for 17 years and her hands-on lessons in environmental science and outdoor education have won much praise

Volain said when she heard about the $1million prize, she told herself, 'Forget it. There are all of these teachers who are presenting internationally and doing big, big things'. 

But her own colleagues were inspired by Volain and her desire to have her students take part in lab work and go outside. 

 She has spread her environmental education knowledge into as many classrooms as she can. 

'I love teaching, and teaching science, because it allows me to learn and work along with my students,' she said. 

'It's the shared experience that is so meaningful to me. Science is curiosity based - finding out why - with eyes, hands and mind. Science is collaborative, science communicates, and science is just so cool.' 

Ritz, who calls himself the 'Chief Eternal Optimist' of Bronx County, was originally a high school special education teacher but moved into urban gardening after the September 11 attacks. 

He and his students planted 15,000 daffodil bulbs across the city and now his gardening program grows 37 different vegetables, fruits and herbs. 

With a goal of sending students home with 100 bags of produce every week, he has established a food production business that focuses on maintaining 'food security' for families in neighborhoods that have limited access for fresh produce. 

Stephen Ritz, 52, is an elementary school teacher in New York City's South Bronx area. He created a low-cost and portable gardening and nutrition program which led him and his students to install more than 100 gardens throughout New York to help families that have limited access to fresh produce

He is currently converting a library at Public School 55 into a 2,000-square-food greenhouse and library.  

'I love teaching because every day I get to do something great. Every day I get to lead children and colleagues on a new quest, we get to do something new, we practice, we dream, we learn and we work together,' he said about his program. 

'I'm also the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet; inherently, I too am very curious and easily excited - it's a perfect storm,' he added. 

The winning teacher will be chosen by a global academy made up of prominent individuals, including academy award winning actor Kevin Spacey; social activist Geoffrey Canada; entrepreneur Baroness Martha Lane Fox; and Carina Wong, Deputy Director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 

Wendy Kopp, CEO Teach for all; Brett Wigdortz, Founder of Teach first; Grammy award winning musician Esperanza Spalding; Nigerian businessman Jubril Adewale Tinubu; and Vice-Principal, Tsinghua International School, China, are also on the panel.

The prize, which was launched in March 2014, aims to 'raise teacher respect across the world' and unearth 'thousands of stories of heroes that have transformed young people's lives', according to a press release from the foundation. 

The top ten finalists were chosen from 50 shortlisted candidates that came from a pool of more than 5,000 nominations from 127 countries including the United States, UK, Italy, Kenya, Uganda, India, Afghanistan, Australia, Argentina, Mexico and Jordan. 

The remaining finalists come from the United States, UK, India, Haiti, Kenya, Cambodia, Afghanistan and Indonesia. The United States is the only country to have more than one finalist in the top ten.
