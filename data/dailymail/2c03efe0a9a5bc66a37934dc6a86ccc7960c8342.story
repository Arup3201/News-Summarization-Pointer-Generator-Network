Coat slung stylishly over her shoulders and wearing a short cream dress, Novella Benini slipped almost unnoticed into Italy’s official World Cup dinner in the team’s quiet coastal retreat of Mangaratiba at the weekend.

This is the woman who has put the smile back on Cesare Prandelli’s face. Whatever the result against England in Manaus on Saturday, the Italy coach will have no problem putting it into perspective.

Because for Prandelli, World Cup disappointment would pale into insignificance compared with the heartache of losing Manuela, his beloved wife of 25 years, to cancer in November 2007.

Heartbreak: Prandelli lost his wife Manuela to cancer in 2007. The two met when he was 18.

Progressive: The Italian coach has got his team playing more progressive football than Macello Lippi managed

The 56-year-old father of two has since found love again with Benini. The couple live together in Florence and the 42-year-old Novella is regularly seen at Italy’s games.

‘The main objective for a man is happiness,’ says Prandelli. ‘I told my children (Nicolo and Carolina) that with Novella’s presence they haven’t lost a father but they have gained a person who is richer again.

'I have met someone who has filled me with the desire to try the joys of love again — and without love I cannot live.’

The people of Italy mourned with Prandelli after Manuela’s early death, and there is a wave of support for him to succeed in Brazil.

The couple first met when an 18-year-old Prandelli was coming home from playing in a Serie B game with Cremonese and dropped into a cafe in his hometown of Orzinuovi near Brescia for a hot chocolate.

‘We never left each other’s side from then on,’ he recalls. ‘We got married in 1982 and in 30 years we only fought once, over a tennis racket if I remember correctly. She taught me everything I know about life.’

Down to earth: Prandelli's humility and dignity has endeared him to the Italian public

Results: Prandelli led Italy to the final of Euro 2012 before their eventual defeat to Spain

With Manuela at his side, Prandelli moved to Atalanta and then Juventus where he played in the same team as Michel Platini.

Later, as a coach, he worked his way up at Lecce, Verona, Venezia and Parma before getting his big opportunity at Roma in 2004.

However, Prandelli stepped down just six weeks into the job when his wife’s breast cancer, first diagnosed several years earlier, became more aggressive.

‘Her life was my life,’ he says. ‘I told her that when the treatment got really invasive I would be by her side every minute, so I went back to Orzinuovi.

'People were surprised by my decision to leave Roma but to me it was natural.’

A year later, Prandelli returned to work and took over at Fiorentina, transforming the club into a Champions League team, but Manuela’s health was failing fast.

‘In those last hours, me and my children lay in bed beside her,’ he recalls. ‘We gave her hugs and kept talking to her. The doctors told us the last thing terminally-ill people lose is their hearing.

'They usually recognise their family’s voices. I will always carry her last words inside me but cannot repeat them. It’s too hard.’

Discipline: The coach has brought the best out of the likes of Mario Balotelli by insisting he modifies his behaviour

The dignified way that Prandelli conducted himself, combined with his growing reputation as a top coach, made him a popular choice to replace Marcello Lippi after Italy’s disastrous performance at the 2010 World Cup.

He guided his country to the final of Euro 2012, modifying a traditionally rigid style in favour of a more positive approach with players encouraged to be more creative.

‘Prandelli is a very good guy and a clever coach,’ Napoli boss Rafael Benitez told Sportsmail. ‘He came to meet me in Naples to talk about possible selections for Italy’s squad.

'He knows his players well. They play good attacking football under him but also keep to the Italian roots of a strong defence.’

A man whose quiet lifestyle has earned him the nickname Il Prete, The Priest, has introduced a strict code of ethics, refusing to pick players like Mario Balotelli, Daniele De Rossi and Mattia Destro when they were suspended for their clubs.

He has also urged his players to be more humble towards their fans and invited a local priest to attend Italy’s World Cup training camp at their Coverciano headquarters near Florence last month.

The four-time world champions might welcome some divine intervention after failing to win any of their last seven internationals.

Ever composed and dapper, Prandelli does not seem unduly concerned. ‘History shows us that we have been able to overcome difficulties,’ he says. After all, he has overcome far worse.
