Ecuador striker Enner Valencia has been granted a work permit to complete his move to West Ham.

A deal estimated to be worth £12million had been done with his Mexican club Pachuca subject to the permit being approved, which has now been done after a hearing at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday.

With club-record signing Andy Carroll ruled out for four months following surgery on an ankle injury, Sam Allardyce was desperate for a boost to his fortunes and with three goals in three games at the World Cup Valencia could be news he needed.

Valencia, 24, joins on a five-year contract after attracting attention from around Europe.

BORN: November 4 1989 (age 24)

2010-2013: Emelec (124 apps, 27 gls)

2014-2014: Pachuca (23, 18)

2014-NOW: West Ham (0, 0)

2012-NOW: Ecuador (13, 7)

Carroll, 
who also missed a similar period at the start of last season, was sorely
 missed when sidelined until January but Allardyce has made moves in the
 transfer market to bolster his attacking options - even before the 
England international's latest setback.

Valencia expressed his excitement at joining the Hammers in what he called 'the top league'.

'I really appreciate the welcome I've been given and I'm excited to be here,' he told West Ham TV.

'I've already watched and read a lot about the club to learn about it - I know the fans are really passionate and I'm really glad to have signed.

'The World Cup was a good tournament for me personally, I scored three times and for my first World Cup it was a good experience, but I hope my next one is better for me and the team.

'Of course, the World Cup gives me confidence to come to Europe and I want to take and advance with this opportunity that West Ham have given to me.'

On his way: Valencia's move to West Ham was subject to the granting of a work permit which is now complete

West Ham had named Valencia as their fifth summer signing before their treacherous New Zealand tour.

'West
 Ham United are delighted to announce that exciting Ecuador 
international forward Enner Valencia will become the Club's fifth summer
 signing, subject to a successful work permit hearing,' a statement on 
their official website read.

'Valencia,
 who impressed hugely in scoring three goals for his country at the FIFA
 World Cup finals in Brazil, will join West Ham on a five-year contract 
for an undisclosed fee.'

Valencia,
 who started his career with Emelec before moving to Pachuca, comes to 
West Ham for a deal close to the club-record amount paid for fellow 
striker Andy Carroll last summer.

Sidelined again: West Ham are without star striker Andy Carroll for four months

After completing his move from 
Liverpool Carroll struggled for fitness last season and goalscoring was a
 problem for Sam Allardyce's side.

With
 Valencia, who also scored in Ecuador's World Cup warm-up draw with 
England, now on board Allardyce will be hoping the Hammers' reliance on 
Carroll will be eased.

The
 59-year-old was only assured of his position in May but has now brought
 in five new faces as he looks to improve on last season's 13th-placed 
finish.

Once the work 
permit regulations are dealt with, Valencia will join fellow striker 
Mauro Zarate, Senegal midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate, full-back Aaron 
Cresswell and England youth international Diego Poyet in completing 
moves to Upton Park so far this summer.
