'We all saw some shoes. I think one was on our side and one was on [the other witness's] side, and he just started to scream, "Call 911,"' Larson told CBS News.

'We climbed over the train and found him in a ditch, face-down in some water.' 

Larson said they spent several minutes giving the boy CPR before the emergency services arrived just after 5:30pm.

He was then rushed to a local hospital and flown to one in Salt Lake City, 50 miles north, but he died three hours later from injuries sustained.

Spanish Fork Police Lt. Matt Johnson described the incident as a 'tragic accident.'

He added that the driver of the train saw the children and tried to 'honk and holla' at them to get off the tracks. 

The brakes were slammed down but the  train did not  stop in time.

The engineer of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad vehicle says the youngster appeared to have 'froze' to a standstill while his relatives  jumped to safety.

The train was traveling southeast into Spanish Fork Canyon. 

The name of the five-year-old victim, who apparently resided near the railway tracks at the Diamond Fork Apartment complex, has not yet been released.
