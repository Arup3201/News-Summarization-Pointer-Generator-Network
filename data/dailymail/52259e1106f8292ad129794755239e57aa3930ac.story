You would hope and pray that the car in the first photograph has just stopped.

In fact its driver, accompanied by his wife and young son, continues blithely over the level crossing – seemingly oblivious to the train ploughing towards his vehicle. 

Startling CCTV footage shows the car racing across the train’s path with a split-second  to spare.

It makes it to the other side just as the train hurtles through the crossing, outside Llangadog station near Llandeilo in Wales. The driver, who has not been named, admitted dangerous driving, claiming he had not seen the flashing lights or noticed other cars waiting at the crossing.

He was given a 12-month suspended sentence, disqualified from driving and fined £722. The footage was released by Network Rail to warn of the dangers of taking unnecessary risks at level crossings.

Other pictures show teenage boys risking their lives by sprinting over crossings across the paths of oncoming trains.

Maniac: The driver arrives at the level crossing totally unaware of the approaching train 

The court heard that his wife was left so traumatised by the incident in 2006 they had to move to a nearby town.

In March this year Network Rail was fined £1m after being found guilty of criminal negligence which led to the deaths
of two teenage girls at a level crossing in 2005.

Olivia Bazlington and Charlotte 
Thompson were killed at Elsenham station in Essex when they crossed the 
tracks and were hit by a train.

A
damming risk assessment taken four years earlier had highlighted the 
dangers of leaving the pedestrian gate at the station unlocked.

Judge David Turner QC, sentencing at Chelmsford Crown Court, ordered Network Rail to pay the large fine and £60,000 costs.

He said: 'I have concluded that there
was a clear history of inadequate risk assessment and a failure to heed
and act upon relevant information.

'There was a consistent failure to 
take timely remedial action - a consistent underplaying that this 
crossing was being regularly misused.

'Warnings went unheeded, data insufficiently appraised and critical questions went unasked and unanswered.

'Remedial action was unsatisfactorily delayed.'

Last year there were six deaths and over 300 near misses at level crossings.
