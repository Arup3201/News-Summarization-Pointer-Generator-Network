A small plane carrying three Canadians has disappeared while flying over an Antarctic mountain range, and now bad weather is hampering a search.

The flight was going from a U.S. station near the South Pole to an Italian research base in Terra Nova Bay.

The Calgary Sun newspaper identified the pilot as Bob Heath from the Northwest Territories, an experienced pilot in both the Antarctic and Arctic.

The pilot's wife, Lucy Heath, told the newspaper that she'd been called by airline officials and told 'Bob's plane was down, and they were trying to reach it.'

She said she was just waiting for more news: 'I'm so worried.'

The plane's emergency locator started transmitting in a mountainous area about 280 miles north of the pole.

New
Zealand, US and Italian authorities are working together to find the de
Havilland Twin Otter plane, which they presume has crashed.

It was carrying survival equipment including tents and food, according to New Zealand Search and Rescue Mission Co-ordinator John Ashby.

New Zealand authorities said a Hercules C130 aircraft flew to the Queen Alexandra mountain range early today but was unable to see the aircraft.

Mr Ashby said in a statement that a DC3 aircraft flew over the area where the beacon was transmitting but heavy cloud prevented the rescuers from seeing the ground or any sign of the plane.

'Weather conditions are extremely challenging,' Mr Ashby said.

He said that winds had reached 90 knots per hour and heavy snow was predicted.

He said several planes and helicopters were standing by in Antarctica, waiting until conditions improved so they could travel to the site.

On the online networking site 
LinkedIn, Heath writes that he typically spends this time of year 
coaching and mentoring other pilots to upgrade their skills in polar 
regions.

The plane is owned and operated by Kenn Borek Air Ltd, a Canadian firm based in Calgary that charters aircraft to the U.S. Antarctic programme.

In a release, the National Science Foundation (NSF) said the plane was flying in support of the Italian Antarctic Programme.

There are no permanent residents in Antarctica but typically the population there swells to several thousand in the Southern Hemisphere summer as a number of countries send scientists and other staff to research stations.

The U.S. runs the largest programme, with about 850 staff at its McMurdo Station and another 200 at its Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, where the plane was flying from.
