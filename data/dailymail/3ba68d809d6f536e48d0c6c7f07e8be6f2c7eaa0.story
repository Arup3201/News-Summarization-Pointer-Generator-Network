Steve Jobs used three sentences to console a man who lost his girlfriend to cancer - and in doing so he revealed a poetic thought on existence.

‘Your (sic) most welcome, James,’ he wrote in an email to another native of Cupertino, California. ‘I'm sorry about your girlfriend. Life is fragile.’

The late Apple CEO was responded to a grateful fan's email in April 2010 thanking him for supporting an organ donation programme.

‘James’, the man who emailed Mr Jobs, lost his 24-year-old girlfriend in April 2008 to melanoma skin cancer that spread to her liver.

He wanted to thank Mr Jobs for supporting organ donation at Lucile Packard's Children's Hospital in Palo Alto, California.

‘My girlfriend and I are from Cupertino, since childhood, and it's really nice to see the hometown hero take time out to do this,’ he wrote.

The email was revealed by Business Insider and has been revisited by CNN technology writer Mark Milian’s new book on Mr Jobs’s email inbox.

An ex-colleague of Mr Jobs at his 1980s firm NeXT Computer spoke about an email response when he told Mr Jobs his cancer surgery had been successful.

‘Messages from him were generally laconic,’ Bob Longo told the Pittsburgh Business Times. ‘This one had 20 exclamation points.’

Mr Jobs rarely revealed his philosophical views but is remembered for a Stanford University speech in 2005, reported CNN.

‘Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose,’ he said at the time.

‘No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share.’

Ten years prior to that Mr Jobs told the Computerworld Honors Program he only worried about leaving behind his friends, children and work.

‘We're all going to be dead soon,’ he said. ‘You never know when you're going to go, but you are going to go pretty soon.’
