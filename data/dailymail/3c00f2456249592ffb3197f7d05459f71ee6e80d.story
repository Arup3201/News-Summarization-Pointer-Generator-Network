This is the world's youngest snowboarder who first took to the slopes at just ten months old.

Pint-sized boarder Aspen Haight, now 18 months old, loves nothing more than shooting down the mountains on her own board and has been hooked ever since tasting life in the fast lane last year.

The toddler, from Colorado, has a custom-made board and even tested the world's smallest pair of ski boots during one of her now frequent visits to the slopes.

Aspen's parents, Jill and Dominic, both aged 34, are keen snowboarders but they admit their daughter will be running rings around them in the snow in a few years time.

Mrs Haight said: 'We are very proud of her. I was a competitive snowboarder when I was younger, and my husband was my coach, so snowboarding is in her blood.

'Aspen was 10 months old when we put her on a snowboard without bindings, as soon as she could walk.

'There's a great system in place here for little kids as the smallest boards come equipped with traction pads and 'riglet reels'.

'Aspen started out just standing on the board and we would pull her around the house, this helped tremendously in her having outstanding balance once we put her in bindings and on the snow at 14 months.

'We try and get her out riding at least twice a week or as often as we can.'

Mrs Haight said: 'She's becoming something of an internet star and it's amazing that people around the world are seeing Aspen snowboard'

The proud mother posted videos of her daughter's first appearance on the slopes online and has received messages from people around the world who are astonished at Aspen's snowboarding ability.

Mrs Haight added: 'She's becoming something of an internet star and it's amazing that people around the world are seeing Aspen snowboard.

'She gets so much attention locally as well. We can't take her riding without people recognising her and stopping us to take her picture.

'Every parent thinks their kid is special, but when you have people around the world confirming that, its quite an incredible feeling.

Her parents believe she 'definitely has a future in snowboarding, especially since the pros are getting younger and younger these days'

'As far as other sports, Aspen loves to play in the snow but she's getting pretty good at shooting a basketball too.

'I definitely think she has a future in snowboarding, especially since the pros are getting younger and younger these days.

'She truly loves it, and being outdoors.

'If she didn't like it we wouldn't force it on her.

'I don't want to be that parent, yelling at my kid on the hill, forcing her into something that she doesn't want to do.'
