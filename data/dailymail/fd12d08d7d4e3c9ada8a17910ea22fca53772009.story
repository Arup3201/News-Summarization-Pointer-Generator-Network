The country’s top GP yesterday rejected a Government crackdown on health tourism as ‘xenophobic’.

Dr Clare Gerada, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, insisted doctors would not act as ‘a new border agency’ by asking about the immigration status of patients.

And she cast doubt on the findings of a Government report warning of the huge cost of foreign visitors and short-term migrants.

‘The biggest problem is expats,’ she added. ‘There is a xenophobia. We are denigrating, yet again, immigrants who are more like to be caring for us [as NHS staff] than abusing the health system.’

But former Labour welfare minister Frank Field condemned her remarks, saying: ‘Dr Clare Gerada’s statement exposes the gap between what doctors expect in salaries and how far they are prepared to go to meet their duties as citizens.

‘No one is asking GPs to be part of the Border Agency but they do have a duty to their patients, who pay their salaries and all NHS bills, to ensure that those drawing health services have paid their way.

‘That’s the overwhelming view of their patients, who are increasingly fed up with a welfare state that rewards something for nothing rather than affirming the something for something principle.’

Suggestion: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was no suggestion GPs should act as border guards and any changes would be a part of normal day to day administration

An official report yesterday put the cost of NHS services used by foreign visitors and short-term migrants at £1.9 billion to £2 billion a year.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘No one is suggesting GPs should act as border guards.

'There’s always a small amount of administration involved in GP or NHS registration, and we expect our changes to form a simple part of that.’
