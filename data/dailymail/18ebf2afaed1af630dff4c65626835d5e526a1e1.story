A
farmer is set to become an overnight millionaire after stumbling across
the 70-million-year-old bones of two dinosaurs 
on his land.

The 
enormous 38ft long Tyrannosaurus rex was discovered just a few miles from the 26ft 
Triceratops - and together they are set to fetch more than two 
million pounds.

Experts have described the incredible finds as 'very significant, very impressive and very valuable'.

A 'very significant skeleton: The T-rex skeleton is said to be among the top 20 ever found in the world, as it boasts around 40 per cent of its original bones. The rest of the skeleton is made up of cast bones from other T-rex finds

The T-rex skeleton is so significant that it is said to be among the top 20 ever found in the world, as it boasts around 40 per cent of its original bones.

The rest of the skeleton is made up of cast bones from other T-rex finds.

The Triceratops, a herbivore known for having two large horns on its head and a smaller one on its nose, is 70 per cent original.

The
bones of the gigantic beasts were found on a 20 square mile ranch in 
Hell Creek in the U.S. state of Montana before being excavated by dinosaur
fossil hunters.

They have since been prepared and mounted ready for sale.

The
T-rex has been named ‘Russell’ after the American artist Charles 
Russell, who used a nearby shed when painting some of his Western 
landscapes.

It is tipped to fetch £1.4 million, while the Triceratops could fetch £560,000.

The
world record for the most expensive dinosaur fossil was set in 1997 
when ‘Sue’, a Tyrannosaurus rex, sold for £5.4 million.

Tom
Lindgren, from Bonhams auctioneers' natural history department, said: 'These dinosaurs are very significant, very impressive and very 
valuable.

'Both were 
found on the same ranch in Montana just a few miles apart in summer 
2012, when a rancher noticed some bones sticking out of his land.

Triceratops was a 10 foot tall herbivorous dinosaur that roamed in the area east of the Rocky Mountains in North America. It shared its habitat with - and was preyed upon by - the carnivorous Tyrannosaurus that was around 12 foot tall and 40 foot long, illustrated in this CGI-style image

'The T-rex is among the top 20 ever found - it is a fascinating and exciting time for paleontology and the hope is that the skeletons can go a museum where people can see them.

'Their
sheer presence is incredibly humbling, and it is amazing to think these
creatures would have been walking our planet 70 million years ago.'

The auction will take place at Bonhams in New York on November 19.
