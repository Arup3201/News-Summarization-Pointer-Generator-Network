Missing 13-year-old girl Samantha Dodson - who had not be seen since Tuesday night - has been found safe by police in the company of a 40-year-old 'family friend' in a mobile home park just outside Oregon City.

Samantha Dodson's parents awoke to find her missing from the family's Oregon City home in Oregon on Wednesday morning.

The Clackamas County Sheriffâ€™s Office said she was believed to be with Kelsey McCune, 40, a friend of Dodson's father who has no known address. He had spent Thanksgiving with the family.

Sarah Dodson, Samantha's sister, said the family were 'worried about the twos relationship'.

Found: Samantha Dodson, 13, was located by police at the weekend in the company of 40-year-old Kelsey McCune (right), who has been arrested and charged with kidnapping and interfering

On Saturday deputies responded to a tip from a person who had recognized Dodson from missing persons flyers, according to KPTV.

The tipster, believed to be a woman walking her dog, saw both Dodson and McCune in a wooded park area at the north end of the Country Village Mobile Home park off S Maple Lane Rd.

Authorities responded by sending in a SWAT team, due to the size of the area and the need to search it quickly.

Dodson was reported to be in a good condition but was transported to a local hospital for a check up.

McCune was arrested and booked into the Clackamas County Jail on a charge of kidnapping and interfering.

Concerned: Samantha's sister Sarah said she was worried about their relationship

As the search for the pair started during the week, police said the girl could have left willingly with McCune, according to KOIN.

Samantha's sister Sarah said the family were ' most worried'.

'We're most worried about where she is and is she safe,' Samantha's sister, Sarah, told KATU.

'And then we're also really worried about their relationship and what is happening between them.'

The sheriff's office said that the girl had no history of suicide attempts or running away from home.

McCune was described as six feet tall and 170 pounds. He has a glass eye and graying hair.

His criminal history includes guilty pleas for reckless driving and attempted burglary.

'We're all just doing everything that we 
can to console one another and also to try to figure out where they 
are,' Dodson's sister added.

Samantha Dodson was last seen on Tuesday night at her family home in Oregon City. After the sheriff's department released numerous images of the girl, she was recognized by a woman walking her dog in a mobile home park
