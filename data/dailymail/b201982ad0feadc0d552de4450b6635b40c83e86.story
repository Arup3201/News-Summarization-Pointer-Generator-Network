She's the cheerleader who should be on the basketball team - not chanting from the sidelines.

Ashlee Arnau, a 22-year-old cheerleader at William Carey University in Mississippi, is the latest viral video sensation after footage emerged of her last week pulling off a half court shot with a twist - literally.

The nursing student managed to perform a successful front-flip half-court shot.

A basketball was placed in the middle of the court.Â

Swish! The ball goes straight into the net

And the crowd goes wild

Arnau ran toward it, did a front-flip, grabbed the ball while upside-down and tossed it toward the basket as she righted herself.

The feat raised the roof at William Carey University in Hattiesburg and the entire thing was caught on camera.

Arnau has been practicing the shot since she was 15.

The video, which was uploaded on Janaury 31 following the game last Thursday, has already had almost 2.2 million views.

It is the second time Arnau has pulled off the move before such a crowd.

Last February she mastered the shot for the first time, having attempted it each game since Christmas 2012.

Arnau is forward on the William Carey women's soccer team.

She said the front-flip shot was a takeoff on the front-flip throw-in that soccer players do.

She also runs track.

Arnau is trying to 'concoct' a new move to master.
