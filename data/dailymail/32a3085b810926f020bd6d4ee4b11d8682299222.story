A herdsman struck gold after stumbling upon a nugget weighing almost eight kilograms In China - and estimated to be worth at least $250,000 (£160,000).

Berek Sawut, an ethnic Kazakh, discovered the 7.85kg chunk of precious metal 'practically lying on bare ground', Chinese state media reported.

But the report did not reveal whether the herder would be able to keep his newfound riches.

He described the lump as 'random-shaped' and about 23cm long, 18cm at its widest and up to 8cm thick.

It was estimated to be worth 1.6million yuan ($255,000), Xinhua news agency said, assuming it is 80% pure.

Local gold price expert, Zhu Xinfeng, said natural lumps of the precious metal can fetch several times more than the refined variety. 

The discovery was made in the far western region of Xinjiang - a vast and diverse area bordering Central Asia and abundant in natural resources. 

The nugget was found in Qinghe county, part of Altay (which means 'gold' in Mongolian) prefecture, the report said. 

The area boasts striking scenery, and has an ethnically diverse population including the Kazakhs, Uighurs and Han, China's majority.
