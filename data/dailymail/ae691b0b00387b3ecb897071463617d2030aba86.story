Wearing heat-proof suits and masks to deal with the toxic fumes, researchers gather molten rock from the top of the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii.

Researchers are working to understand
an eruption that destroyed the town of Kalapana more than 20 years ago, hoping that their studies will 
allow other settlements to be better prepared in the future.

Between 7 May and 5 September 1990, the fishing village of Kalapana was slowly encased in molten rock, which burned everything in its path. Today, a No Parking sign is virtually all that remains of the historic settlement.

The Kilauea volcano in Hawaii has been constantly erupting since 1983 and in 2010 swallowed the nearby town of Kalapana, encasing it in molten rock

Scientists are now taking lava samples from the top of the volcano (left) in order to help them predict future eruptions and stop any more towns being destroyed. A 'No Parking' sign (right) is virtually all that remains of Kalapana, though luckily nobody was killed in the eruption

The 'shield' volcano, so called because it resembles a knight's shield, is 4,000ft high and has been constantly erupting since 1983

In these pictures researchers work on the top of the 4,000ft Kilauea volcano. The shots were taken by local photographer G. Brad Lewis, 56, who said: 'Erupting volcanoes have always fascinated me.

'But to be able to get so close and personal to Kilauea Volcano has been a real treat. As a photographer, nothing is more exciting than photographing the many aspects of an erupting volcano.

'I get within inches of the hot lava, at times, depending on which way the wind is blowing. But like any living thing, I am limited by how much heat I can handle.'

As these pictures from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii show, almost nothing remains of the town of Kalapana except for signposts and fire-hydrants.

The volcano is also a tourist destination, with people travelling to watch the spectacular views as lava flows into the ocean and sends plumes of steam into the air

Between the 7 May and 5 September 1990, lava swept through the town, burning everything in its path, although luckily nobody was killed

Luckily no residents were killed when the town was swallowed by the river of molten rock which stuck in 1986 and again in July 2010.

Now scientists are taking samples from the volcanoes to work out when and where they might strike in order to protect other towns and save lives.

To do this they must don suits similar to those worn by fire-fighters and capable of withstanding heat of up to 350C (662F).

'Taking lava samples is important for the scientists to understand the nature of the lava and to predict future flows,' said Brad.

'The more personal they get with the volcano, the better they can understand the many aspects of an eruption.'

Photographer G Brad Lewis, 56, captured the scientists at work. He said in order to work in such intense heat he has to wear shoes with soles stitched rather than glued on, otherwise the glue would melt

Kilauea Volcano is a shield volcano so called as its shape resembles a warrior’s shield. It is primarily made up of fluid lava flows and has been constantly erupting since 1983.

'There are many dangers on the volcano,' said Brad. 'I always wear protective clothing and carry a respirator designed specifically for volcanic fumes.  

'I wear boots with the soles sewn on, not glued, or they would melt off. A good compass, GPS, and rain gear are also critical. White-outs are common on the lava fields.

'Seeing molten lava for the first time is an amazing experience, and very humbling. I love to watch people seeing the volcano for the first time – they are in sheer awe.'

Kilauea volcano in Hawaii's Volcanoes National Park has been constantly erupting since 1983

In 1990 a new lava flow destroyed the historic fishing village of Kalapana, encasing it in rock

Scientists are now studying the volcano by taking samples of 1,200C lava from the active vents

The hope is that study will help predict future eruptions and stop other towns being destroyed
