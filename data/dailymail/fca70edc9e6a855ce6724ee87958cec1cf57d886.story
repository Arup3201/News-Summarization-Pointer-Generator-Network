Wayne Rooney is ready to play in Manchester United’s game at Southampton on Monday after missing the win over Stoke with a knee injury.

It is understood that Rooney declared himself fit on Tuesday morning after hurting himself in a collision with an advertising board against Hull at the weekend, but United decided to leave him out against the Potters as a precaution.

The United and England captain had routine scans Wednesday and is now expected to return to Louis van Gaal’s squad at St Mary’s.

Having put teenager James Wilson on stand-by for a first start of the season, and seen Robin van Persie return to goalscoring form against Hull, Van Gaal named them both in his line-up for Tuesday’s 2-1 win over Stoke with Radamel Falcao once again on the bench.

Despite hanging on desperately towards the end, United’s fourth win in a row has fuelled belief around Old Trafford that the Dutchman has got the club heading firmly in the right direction.
