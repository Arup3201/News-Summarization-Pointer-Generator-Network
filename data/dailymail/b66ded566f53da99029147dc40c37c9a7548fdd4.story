If you've ever questioned whether your sexual performance is up to par, then wonder no more.

A new iPhone app called Spreadsheets offers an incredibly detailed insight into how well you are able to fulfill a lover's needs.

The application times how long sex lasts, monitors  both the speed and frequency of a couple's sexual rhythm as well as the amount of noise created when making sweet music in the bedroom.

Spreadsheets is an app that uses the iPhone's inbuilt accelerometer and microphone to analyse how well you perform sexually. Users keep a record of their achievements and monitor how they improve in the bedroom

Other features include recording the frequency of love-making, the most thrusts per minute a person is able to achieve as well as the peak number of decibels a person makes when reaching climax.

The app, costing $2.99 - although discounted to $1.99 for the rest of this month -  also has a points system whereby you can set yourself a challenge to prove how dedicated you are to your sex life.

A session of early morning loving gets you 10 points, while a lazy Sunday session earns you 20, for example.

Spreadsheets works by monitoring data from a user’s movement and audio levels through the phone's inbuilt accelerometer and microphone, to provide statistical and visual analysis of their performance in bed.

The app does not record or playback audio or video however.

According to the app's homepage, all data is stored securely on a person's mobile device and information is never relayed, backed up, or synced to the internet.

The app give a comprehensive overview of performance and even shows whether you are having sex enough. The app also comes with a planner to make ensure a person makes sex well and truly part of their routine

Spreadsheets is by no means the only erotic-themed app to be found in the iTunes store.

There are apps such as Sex Game that allow you test your knowledge of everything erotic and then there is the What's My Sex Appeal game that quizzes a user to reveal just how attractive they are to other people.

However a large number of apps have been turned down by iTunes for being too explicit and breaching Apple's guidelines.

For example, apps that were deemed too offensive and rejected, include iBoobs, an app that involved shaking the phone to make a pair of virtual breasts move, and PinPoints X that used GPS to plot the location of sex adverts around cities.

There was also the Puff app that involved causing a gust of air to lift up girls' skirts on the screen and Video Strip Poker app that would remove clothing from a virtual model each time a user won a card hand.
