It was one of Google's most mysterious projects - a barge that was believed to be everything from a 'party barge' to a secret server farm cooled by sea water.

However, Google today confirmed that at least one of its two barges is being scrapped.

However, the firm has still not revealed exactly what they were supposed to be for.

A barge built with four levels of windowed shipping containers is seen docked at a pier on Treasure Island in San Francisco. It was later moved to Stockton. google confirmed today one of the two barges will be scrapped.

The barge carries dozens of old shipping containers that were joined to create a four-story building. Google envisioned it as one of three floating retail stores.

‘A floating data center? A wild party boat? A barge housing the last remaining dinosaur?

'Sadly, none of the above,’ a Google spokesman said following huge interest in the structures when they were first spotted last year.

‘Although it’s still early days and things may change, we’re exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology.’

MailOnline got up close to one of the barges in California and was able to get a better idea of the floating vessel.

Speculation was rampant over what the barges will be used for - with the two most likely reasons being floating showroom 'party boats' to market Google Glass or data centers that can be cooled by sea water.

Google's barge up close: One of the two barges will be scrapped, Google said today.

Such is the level of secrecy surrounding the project - said to be overseen by Google founder Sergey Brin himself and his Google X team - even members of the Coast Guard have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements along with the teams of engineers and welders who have been working there.

The Portland Press Herald says an international company is buying the barge and taking it on an ocean voyage.

The barge was originally spotted in San Franciso's Treasure Island, and later moved to Stockton.

A second, identical barge is in Portland- and will now be ripped apart.

Portland Harbor's deputy harbor master says the containers will be disassembled and scrapped.

The barge first docked in Portland Harbor in October and moved to South Portland Wednesday.

A Portland city spokeswoman says the city received $400,000 in state reimbursements while it docked there.

Google initially had little to say about the barges, leading to speculation about its intentions. It later revealed they were to be stores.

The second is still moored in Stockton, California.
