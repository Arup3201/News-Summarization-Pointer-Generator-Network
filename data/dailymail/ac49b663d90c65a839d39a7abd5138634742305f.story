Parents have been urged to replace a child car seat after it failed safety tests and was branded dangerous. 

Consumer group Which? has issued an alert to warn all parents about the danger of the seat, which was on sale online and at Argos, after it scored zero in safety tests. 

It said they had found a 'serious failing' when the seat was put through crash tests, during which parts of it were ripped off. In a real crash the child would be at risk of colliding with the seat in front because of the failure of parts of the seat.

Argos, which sold the car seat, said the seat had been removed from its catalogue in July, but a small amount of remaining stock would still be sold as the seat passes standard European safety tests.

The Babystart car seat failed the safety tests done by Which? and scored zero in one of the trials carried out

Which? safety tests are more stringent than the standard European tests - including a 'slide test' and a front-on crash at a higher speed. 

The Babystart multi-recline child seat was previously on sale for £35.

 A spokesman from Which? said: 'If you own this seat, or know anybody who has this seat, we advise you to replace it as soon as possible due to a serious failing we uncovered in our car seat crash testing.'

The seat has passed official EU regulatory tests to be sold as suitable for children from birth up to 18kg, and was marked as ECE R44/04 approved.

The car seat is no longer being produced but Argos confirmed it was still selling any existing stock it had as it had met the standard European safety regulations. 

A spokeswoman said: 'As the product meets all of the required safety regulations we have not removed the remaining stock from sale.'

Which? said second-hand products are available on websites such as Gumtree and Ebay and advised against buying the seat or any second-hand car seats.

The Which? front crash tests are carried out at 40mph, rather than 30mph, and these caused the shoulder parts of the seat to break off 

When the seat was facing forward and subjected to a front crash test the plastic seat shell did not withstand the crash and the harness came away as the plastic broke. The crash test dummy was not restrained properly and it scored 0

The assessment also includes a slide impact crash test, which the seat still scored poorly for 

The seat was marginally better when it was facing backwards, but still only scored 33 per cent 

Which? tests child car seats in a real car body, not on a sledge with a car bench seat fixed to it. This makes the fixing points for seatbelts more realistic 

The seat scored the lowest ever test score of zero per cent in the more demanding, independent crash tests, which are conducted at higher speeds and forces than the current UK standards require.

Which? branded the seat a ‘don’t buy’ because the shoulder parts of the harness were ripped out of the plastic seat shell as it broke under the force of the crash tests.

If this were to happen in a real-life crash, a child would collide with the seat in front, with just the lap part of the belt keeping them attached to the car seat.

Argos no longer lists this particular seat in its catalogue. But it does sell a range of other Babystart car seats on its website. As well as pushchairs, highchairs, baby carriers and equipment produced by the company.

The tests, carried out by the test laboratory of the German car club ADAC, are well-respected for how they have contributed to improving the standard of child car seat safety over the last decade.

Any child car seat marked as approved to ECE R44/04 is better than no car seat at all and will provide some protection in a crash, but the results indicate that a child using the Babystart Multi-Recline car seat in Group 1 mode, reclined, would be at risk of serious injury in the simulated crashes.

The seat is not on Argos' current list of recalls but Which? said production has stopped.

A spokeswoman at Argos said: 'Customer safety is our top priority and we were extremely concerned to hear of the issues raised in the Which? Report regarding the BabyStart Multi Recline Car Seat.

'Following an internal investigation alongside our supplier TeamTex, we can confirm that we have had no issues or customer complaints in relation to this product.

'The BabyStart range is sold exclusively at Argos and we stopped selling this particular car seat in July as part of our normal new range process, however a small number of car seats are still available.'
