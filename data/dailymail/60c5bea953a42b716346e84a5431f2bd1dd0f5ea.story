Bungee jumper on Queensland's Gold Coast: Psychologists think that the reason we're so bad at second-guessing our future selves is that we can't predict our emotions when we're assessing risk

We've all seen it - when someone is cool and confident before an event, then when the 'moment of truth' arrives they go to pieces.

Now psychologists think they understand why people are so prone to doing it - and how to avoid it.

When we 'sign up' to do something, we don't feel the emotions we'll feel at the crucial point - and so we make bold decisions that we then regret.

People are unable to imagine what it will be like to fail - called an 'empathy gap'.

The courage that people summon is illusionary - and crumbles instantly when real emotions come into play.

Scientists found that merely showing a video that caused fear or embarassment before asking someone to take a risk made them far more sensible.

'People frequently face embarrassing situations in everyday life, and the illusion of courage is
 likely to cause us to expose ourselves to risks that, when the moment 
of truth arrives, we wish we hadn't taken,' said George Loewenstein, the CMU's Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.

The scientists say that people can use this knowledge to avoid looking like idiots.

'Knowing that, we might choose to be more cautious,' says Lowenstein, 'Or we might use the 
illusion of courage to help us take risks we think are worth it, knowing
 full well that we are likely to regret the decision when the moment of 
truth arrives.'

In a series of three experiments, the researchers found that people overestimate their willingness to engage in embarrassing public performances.

They also found that they could reduce this illusion of courage by inducing immediate emotions that effectively put them in touch with the fear they would experience.

College students were asked if they would be willing to engage in a future embarrassing situation ¿ dancing to James Brown's Sex Machine in front of the class ¿ in exchange for a few dollars. They were very bad at assessing their reactions

'We might think that we know ourselves
 well enough to predict our own behavior in such situations,' said Leaf 
Van Boven, associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at the 
University of Colorado Boulder. 

'But that knowledge isn't 
sufficient to overcome the empathy gap — our inability to anticipate the
 impact of emotional states we aren't currently experiencing.'
In the first two experiments, college students were asked if they would be willing to engage in a future embarrassing situation — telling a funny story to their class in one study, and dancing to James Brown's Sex Machine in front of the class in the other — in exchange for a few dollars.

Students were either asked outright or after being exposed to short films that aroused mild experiences of fear and anger.

Students who did not view movie clips significantly overestimated their willingness to sing or dance.

When they experienced negative emotions - fear and anger - as a result of watching the movie clips, students were much more accurate in predicting their own future lack of interest in performing.
