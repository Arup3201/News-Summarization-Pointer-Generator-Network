FIFA faced a backlash from its major sponsors last night as the corruption scandal intensified over the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.

Adidas, Visa and Sony expressed their anger after further allegations emerged that the football governing body’s former vice president, Mohamed Bin Hammam, used bribes to secure votes for Qatar’s bid.

The global firms are three of the six main sponsors – known as partners – of the World Cup, which starts in Brazil on Thursday.

Reaction: Adidas, Visa and Sony expressed their anger after further allegations emerged that the football governing body¿s former vice president, Mohamed Bin Hammam (pictured), used bribes to secure votes for Qatar's bid

Fifa made £1billion from sponsorship at the previous World Cup in South Africa and relies heavily on continued advertising revenue from major firms.

In a strongly worded statement,  Adidas said ‘the negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners’.

Meanwhile electronics giant Sony called on Fifa to carry out an ‘appropriate investigation’ into claims of wholesale corruption during the bidding process.

A spokesman said: ‘We expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately. We continue to expect Fifa to adhere to its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations.’

Visa spoke of its desire for the governing body to ‘maintain strong ethical standards’. ‘We understand Fifa is taking this matter seriously and we will continue to monitor its internal investigation,’ it said. ‘We expect Fifa will take the appropriate actions.’

Outrage: Former sports minister David Mellor has said the tournament should never have been given to Qatar

Fifa’s contract with Adidas is worth £210million and Visa’s bill for its sponsorship is £100million.

Sony’s agreement expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal.

The other three major sponsors – Coca-Cola, Hyundai and Emirates – were approached for comment yesterday but did not respond.

Former Conservative sports minister David Mellor said: ‘What is quite clear is this World Cup should never have been awarded to Qatar and can never be played in Qatar.’

Further damning claims surrounding the bid were published yesterday. Mr Bin Hammam, Qatar’s top football chief, stands accused of organising a major gas deal to secure key votes for the country’s World Cup bid.

A cache of millions of leaked documents revealed how he brokered government-level talks through the Thai member of Fifa’s executive committee over the deal, which was potentially worth tens of millions of pounds to Thailand.

He is also accused of setting up meetings between the Qatari royal family and at least seven Fifa committee members, including president Sepp Blatter.

The revelations come a week after the Sunday Times first published claims Mr Bin Hammam used £3million from secret slush funds to bribe officials.

Fifa’s chief investigator, Michael Garcia, is assessing the process and will submit a report next month.

Mr Blatter finally broke his silence over the claims yesterday, writing on Twitter: ‘Never ignoring media reports on ethics allegations in football. But let the Ethics Committee work!’

Controversial: Argentina's players posesfor a picture with a banner reading in Spanish 'The Malvinas are Argentine'

From CHRISTIAN GYSIN IN RIO DE JANEIRO

The arrival of the England team in Brazil was mired in controversy yesterday as players immediately found themselves drawn into a storm over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.

The moment midfielder Frank Lampard emerged from the team bus outside their hotel near Rio de Janeiro yesterday, one journalist, thought to be Argentine, could be heard shouting: ‘What do you think about the Falklands – or Las Malvinas?’ Lampard ignored the question as the squad entered the hotel.

Tensions rose after Argentine players unfurled a banner before their warm-up friendly against Slovenia, claiming sovereignty of the islands they call Las Malvinas.

Before the game in Argentina, players unfurled a banner saying: ‘Las Malvinas Son Argentinas (The Malvinas are Argentine).’

The FA appeared to have been anticipating the row – which has overshadowed World Cup clashes between England and Argentina since the Eighties – as Roy

Hodgson’s side played their own final warm-up game in Miami on Saturday.

Pictures show a whiteboard in the England dressing room filled with team tactics, including the words ‘DON’T ANSWER QUESTIONS ON FALKLANDS!!!’ in capitals.
