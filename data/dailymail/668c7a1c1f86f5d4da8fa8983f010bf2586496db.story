Reforms: Michael Gove announced changes to GCSE exams aiming to put the focus back on academic rigour and one-off exams

The biggest shake-up in school exams for a generation will see discredited GCSEs scrapped  and replaced with English  Baccalaureate Certificates.

A return to end-of-course exams in traditional academic subjects and the slashing of coursework and resits will ‘restore rigour’ to the education system, Michael Gove said yesterday.

The Education Secretary also announced tough core EBC courses which will be taught from 2015, with the first exams sat two years later.

Students will be awarded a full English Baccalaureate if they succeed in six core subjects: English, maths, two sciences – from physics, biology and chemistry – a language and geography or history.

The GCSE brand could be scrapped altogether in 2016 to make a clean break with a system first introduced in 1988.

A single exam board will preside over each subject, bringing an end to competition which Mr Gove said had encouraged a ‘corrupt effort to massage up pass rates’.

Announcing the reforms in the Commons, he said: ‘It is time for the race to the bottom to end. It is time to tackle grade inflation and dumbing down. It is time to raise aspirations.’

‘After years of drift, decline and dumbing down, at last we are reforming our examination system to compete with the world’s best.’

The aim of Mr Gove’s reforms is to restore O-level-style rigour in a bid to halt the nation’s slide down the international schools league tables. However his ambition to fully replicate the O-level system, in which only the brightest sat the toughest exam, has been shelved following opposition from Nick Clegg.

The Deputy Prime Minister’s 
intervention also delayed the reforms by a year, raising fears Labour 
could try to save GCSEs if the party wins the next election. But 
education sources last night said the reforms were ‘unstoppable’.

Mr Gove also revealed less able pupils would be offered the chance to take the new EBC exams at 17 or 18 instead of 16.

Catch up: The new exams are more rigorous and top grades will only go to the brightest children in an attempt to help English schools catch up with other countries as we trail in school standards

He and Mr Clegg put on a show of unity 
yesterday with a joint article in which they launched a pre-emptive 
attack on teaching unions and the Labour Left.

They said: ‘Together we can overcome 
those forces that have held our children back – the entrenched 
establishment voices who have become the enemies of promise.’

The proposals will see hundreds of 
thousands of 11-year-olds, who started secondary school this  term, 
becoming the new ‘guinea pigs’ of the education system. Exam boards have
 previously been accused of ‘dumbing down’  GCSEs to attract the 
multi-million pound business from secondary schools.

But under the reforms, just one will 
be selected by Ofqual to offer qualifications in each subject in a bid 
to prevent the ‘race to the bottom’.

Nick Gibb, a schools minister until this month's reshuffle, insisted the plans couldn't be reversed even if Labour won the next general election

GCSEs in other subjects are also being toughened up and are unlikely to keep the ‘GCSE’ title.

Currently, many GCSEs have two tiers so pupils can either be entered for the foundation level – the simpler of the two and the maximum grade achievable is a C – or the higher level, where students can get up to an A*.

Under the shake-up, the foundation and higher level will be scrapped in the EBC subjects, meaning there will be no cap on how well pupils can achieve.

A consultation document by the Department for Education suggests exam boards come up with ‘new and different grading structures’. They will be expected to ‘differentiate’ between top achievers and provide a ‘statement of achievement’ for those who are not entered for EBCs.

The Government’s ‘preferred approach’ is to remove controlled assessment – or coursework done under exam conditions – from all six English Baccalaureate subjects.

Other reforms including scrapping bite-sized modules and resits.

The overhaul is expected to result in fewer top achievers. This summer, pupils passed 22.4 per cent of GCSEs at A or A*.

Stephen Twigg MP, Labour’s education spokesman, claimed the changes were ‘totally out of date’ and could be a ‘Trojan horse’ for the introduction of a two-tier system in the future. Teaching unions also condemned the change.  Martin Johnson, of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: ‘O-levels were abolished 25 years ago for a very good reason: they just tested memory and essay writing, which are not crucial  skills for the majority of jobs or  life today.’

But business welcomed the move. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Business leaders want a stronger curriculum and more rigorous exams. These measures are welcome progress towards delivering that.’

GCSEs Tens of thousands of pupils can bump up grades by re-sitting parts of the GCSE exams until they get a pass.EBaccs Partial resits will end. Pupils will be forced to resit the entire exam.

GCSEs The final exam can be as short as 90 minutesEBaccs Exams will be much longer, possibly three hoursGCSEs Maths exams have little algebra, English exams include ‘bite sized’ replies and rigorous English-to-foreign-language translations are rare.EBaccs More algebra in maths exams, more full length essays in English and a return to full English-to-foreign-language translation tests.GCSEs Up to 50 per cent of exams are studied via modules and continual assessment.EBaccs Replaced by one or two tougher exams at end of two-year course.GCSEs Technically, everyone who gets a grade from A to G grade is deemed to have achieved  a ‘pass’.EBaccs New 1 to 6 pass grade, 7 onwards will be fail.GCSEs 22 per cent get A or A* grade. Around seven per cent of all candidates gain an A*.EBaccs As few as five per cent may get the top Grade 1.
