Phuoc Wagner, three, from Canada who received a life-saving liver transplant from her father, has had her long-awaited homecoming postponed after contracting norovirus.

The toddler, who was possibly going to be released this week,  remains in hospital as she recovers from the stomach flu.

Phuoc and her twin sister Binh, adopted from Vietnam, were both in need of liver transplants because they suffer from Alagille syndrome, a genetic condition.

Last month, their father Michael Wagner was able to give a portion of his liver to Phuoc - leaving him with an impossible decision after being a match for both girls, but only able to give the donation to one daughter.

Following doctors' suggestions that he  give the transplant to Phuoc since she needed it the soonest, they underwent surgery in February.

The pair were reunited  in a heart-warming moment shared by the family after the successful surgery.

Phuoc Wagner (pictured above 17 days after her liver transplant surgery), three, who received a life-saving liver transplant from her father, has had her long-awaited homecoming postponed after contracting norovirus

Last month, her father Michael Wagner was able to give a portion of his liver to her, which left him to make an impossible decision after realizing he would only be able to give the donation to just one of his daughters (above Phuoc post surgery last month)

Phuoc and Binh (the girls pictured above), adopted from Vietnam, were both in need of liver transplants because they suffer from Alagille syndrome, a genetic condition 

The girls mother, Johanne, said that they are still waiting on a living donor for Binh as they continue to be patient for Phuoc's return home, according to ABC News.

However in good news, reports last month said the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto had received 400 submissions from people offering to be a living donor for Binh.   

Mrs Wagner wrote on Facebook: 'No homecoming yet - norovirus is keeping Phuoc in hospital. And norovirus in my house as well. Home front needs to be clear before they can come home.'

Only a few days ago, she had written of the reunion between the girls, and also her nervous feelings about welcoming Phuoc back after her surgery.

Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and five days after the operation, the family posted a video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. Mrs Wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well, and updated supporters on her husband and daughter's recovery

In the run-up to the surgery, Mr Wagner said it has been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls (above, Phuoc pictured right, with her mother, left, holding Binh)

'Binh and Phuoc will soon be reunited. Talks of Phuoc's release from hospital this week. Some time spent together before Binh's transplant will be beneficial. Both girls keep asking for each other and the family needs to be reunited,' she wrote.

'It is scary though to welcome her back so soon after transplant. A lot of new stuff to assimilate. Daily nursing visits for weeks to come to administer IV meds and perform bloodwork. 

'But most of all, the fear of something going wrong, and quickly. No germs allowed in our household. A lot of quiet time needed to allow for full recovery for both Daddy and Phu-Phu.'

Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and five days after the operation, the family posted a  video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room.

Mrs Wagner (above with Binh at their family home) wrote on Facebook that the girls keep asking to see each other while Phuoc is still in hospital. She confirmed that their search continues for a living donor for Binh

The mother shared her concerns about welcoming Phuoc back after her surgery and having nervous feelings about something going wrong (above her post on Facebook)

'Hey mon belle!' Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. 

He then moves to side of Phuoc's bed and kisses her on the head and asks how she fells in French, as the two share a tender father-daughter moment. 

Mrs Wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well, and updated supporters on her husband and daughter's recovery, as well as their continued search to find a donor for Binh. 

'So hard to believe we are hitting the one week mark: it seems like a blur,' Mrs Wagner wrote on Facebook. 'Michael still in hospital, Phuoc still on morphine, and mommy holding on on coffee. Still a fair amount of discomfort for Michael but he managed to visit his little girl two days in a row.' 

In the run-up to the surgery, Mr Wagner said it has been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls.

The Wagners said the girls’ doctor was the one who ultimately decided that Phuoc would get her father’s liver based on medical necessity. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has received 400 submissions from people wanting to be donors for Binh

'The cruel part of the liver is that you can only do it once,' he told the site Yahoo Canada.

The Wagners said the girls’ doctor was the one who ultimately decided that Phuoc would get her father’s liver based on medical necessity.

Gary Levy, who runs the liver donor program at the Toronto General Hospital, told The Canadian Press vial Global News that donors can give up to 70 per cent of their liver, which will regrow to its full size, but it can only be done once.

The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phuoc in.

Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really.

'They were nine pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.'

Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision.

She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 

'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.'
