A college student threatens to drop out of Dartmouth over the university's refusal to allow her to carry a handgun on its campus in New Hampshire.

Taylor Woolrich, 20, says the university refused her request to carry a concealed firearm on campus to defend herself from Richard Bennett, 67, who she claims been stalking her since she was 16.

Bennett is currently sitting behind bars in California on charges of violating a restraining order filed by Woolrich.

'Every morning I check the inmate lookup online to see if he has made bail,' Woolrich told Fox News.

'I feel safe for now, but the day he gets out is the day I have to leave Dartmouth.'

Bennett was arrested on felony charges in June for breaking the terms of a restraining order Woolrich had filed against him, San Diego County sheriffs records say.

When Bennett was pulled over, KGTV reports, cops found what was they described as a 'rape kit,' which included a flashlight, gloves, binoculars and a rope tied in a noose.

According to sheriffs records, Bennett was also charged with three counts of violating a court order prohibiting the possession of firearms.

The college junior spoke at a conference in D.C. called Students for Concealed Carry and said that university officials told her there was 'no way' she could carry a gun on campus, regardless of whether she obtained a license.

'No appeals process, no supervisor,' added Woolrich.

Dartmouth's website states that handguns brought to campus 'must be stored at the Department of Safety and Security.'

After being refused her request to carry a weapon, Woolrich says she began contacting campus security to request escorts but started receiving responses such as 'You can't keep calling us all the time' or was told only to call after 9 p.m.

As of publication, Dartmouth officials had not responded to requests for comment but university spokesman Justin Anderson told Fox News that, 'We are equipped and committed to providing the best safety possible for all our students.'

Bennett met Woolrich when she was 16 at the San Diego-area coffee shop where she worked. She says the older man kept 'staring at her for long periods of time and trying to flirt with her.'

Court documents state he also invited her to go camping with him multiple times.

Bennett was arrested after he visited Woolrich's home in California offering 'landscaping services' the day after Woolrich had returned home from summer break, according to KGTV.

The alleged stalker was stopped on a nearby highway when cops discovered the 'rape kit.'
