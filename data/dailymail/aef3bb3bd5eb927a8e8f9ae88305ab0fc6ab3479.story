Abbie Keers was left with these horrific injuries after the alleged incident in Stanley, County Durham

A man accused of smashing a beer bottle through a car window and injuring a schoolgirl is to face crown court.

Matthew McCrea is charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and is alleged to have thrown a bottle at the silver Fiat Punto car a family was travelling in.

Abbie Keers, nine, is said to have been sitting in the passenger seat and needed surgery after the alleged incident on the A693 in Stanley, County Durham, at around 10.20pm on Valentine's Day.

McCrea, 24, spoke only to confirm his name and details at Consett Magistrates' Court. He entered no plea to the charge.

The youngster was travelling with her grandmother, former Northumbria Police officer Sandra Webb, mum Clare Webb and little sister Lexi, who was three at the time.

The car was travelling from the roundabout near the library towards the Asda roundabout when it was hit by the bottle.

Blair Martin, prosecuting, said: 'The vehicle was a Fiat motor vehicle driven by the injured party's grandmother.

'Also in the car was the injured party's sibling and the mother of the children. The injured party was in fact in the front passenger seat.

'The vehicle was driven through the underpass along the A693 Stanley bypass.

'It has been level with the entrance when the bottle has been thrown at the windscreen.

'It has gone through the windscreen and caused injury to Abbie's face.'

The schoolgirl is said to have been left with facial injuries so serious she was immediately rushed to hospital.

The youngster is alleged to have needed surgery to remove pieces of glass from her face from just below her left eye.

Although the alleged incident was said to have been traumatic for the youngster, she is not believed to have been left permanently scarred.

Abbie also suffered cuts to her forehead, hands, nose and around her right eye.

The East Stanley Primary and Junior School pupil spoke publicly about her ordeal at the time.

The keen gymnast said: 'The glass cut into my face and was stinging - it was very painful. But the doctors said I had been very lucky.'

Magistrates have declined jurisdiction of the case, believing it is so serious as to be heard at crown court.
