From children working hard in the fields to a group of soldiers pushing a broken-down bus, these are the photographs that North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, didn't want you to see.

Taken by photographer Eric Lafforgue during what would prove to be his final visit to the rogue state, the images reveal the shocking extent of the deprivation suffered by the people who live there.

Lafforgue, who has now been banned from North Korea, took the pictures while in the company of state-approved guides and was asked to delete each of the images but managed to save them on his memory card.

Multi-purpose:
 'The North Korean army is said to be one of the most important in the 
world. But if you travel there, you’ll often see soldiers doing menial 
tasks'

Unamused:
 'The officials hate it when you take this kind of picture. Even when I 
explained that poverty exists everywhere, they still forbade me from 
taking them'

Child
 labour: 'When times are hard (as they usually are here), children can 
be found working for the farming collectives,' explains Lafforgue

Shocking: 'North Korean officials forbid you to photograph anyone suffering from malnutrition like this man or this little boy'

Not
 allowed: It is forbidden to take pictures of North Korean people if 
they are not well dressed. For my guide this man was not well dressed 
enough to be photographed'

Scraps:
 'I spotted these kids collecting maize grains in the streets near 
Begaebong,' explains Lafforgue of this surreptitious shot

Fascinatingly,
 not all show the poverty that the North Korean leadership is so keen to
 hide. Others offer a glimpse of the country's bomb shelter tube stations, dilapidated
 buildings and draconian clothing regulation.

Others
 show children smiling and laughing beneath portraits of Kim Jong Un and
 his father Kim Jong Il - an act considered incredibly disrespectful by 
the regime.

'Every
 visitor is warned not to take photos without the consent of the guides 
as soon as they arrive in Pyongyang,' explains Lafforgue. 'But in 
reality, it's impossible for them to monitor everything, especially when
 travelling with groups.

'They
 insist that you don't take photos of anything to do with the military 
and anything that could suggest poverty - even when you explain to them 
that it exists all over the world and even in France.

'In
 Pyongyang, as only the elite is allowed to live there, you don't see 
real poverty but as soon as you get out into the countryside, it's a 
completely different story.'

Unique:
 'A woman standing in the middle of a crowd of soldiers. This picture 
was not supposed to be taken as officials do not allow pictures of the 
army'

Break-down:
 North Korea is touchy about images showing the military. 'You see this 
all the time in North Korea, but aren't allowed to take pictures,' says 
Lafforgue

No
 photos! 'Taking pictures in the demilitarised zone (between North and 
South Korea) is easy, but if you come too close to the soldiers, they 
stop you'

Not
 allowed: Taking photos of soldiers relaxing, such as this photograph of
 two men enjoying a sneaky cigarette, is not allowed in North Korea

Bizarre:
 'When visiting the dolphinarium in Pyongyang, you are allowed to 
photograph the animals, but not the soldiers who make up 99 per cent of 
the crowd!'

Enraged:
 The North Korean regime hates photos that show soldiers resting. 'This 
picture really contributed to me getting banned from the country,' says 
Lafforgue

But even 
in Pyongyang, signs of poverty are all too apparent. Images that reveal 
the extent of the regular power shortages, which the regime blames on 
'American imperialists', and the crumbling interiors of the outwardly 
well-maintained apartment blocks speak clearly of deprivation.

In the countryside, the sight of people picking grass and children working in the fields are regular occurrences. 'The guides tell you that they [the children] work in 
the fields in the same way that teenagers here have summer jobs,' adds Lafforgue.

'The 
difference is that in Europe they are paid, while in North Korea, it is a collective 
duty. I must say that they always seemed
 "happy" and didn't appear to be miserable. But the gap between poverty and 
patriotic enthusiasm is a narrow one.'

In
 a bid to prevent visitors from capturing photos deemed 'unacceptable' 
by the regime, state minders often attempt to confiscate the cameras 
owned by their charges.

Cold
 shower: A man bathes in the river in the countryside outside Pyongyang.
 'Once you get into rural areas, this sort of thing is very common,' 
says Lafforgue

Fishing:
 'This man was using an old tyre for a boat. In the countryside, people 
often fish in small lakes - it's a way to get fresh food in remote areas
 where it's rare'

Hunger: 'My camera was confiscated for the duration of the bus trip to Chongjin which suffered in the famine. Once I saw the people in the street, I understood why'

Snooze: 'This man was taking a rest by the sea in Chilbo. My guide asked me to delete this for fear that Western media would say this man was dead. He was alive'

Poverty:
 'In Kaesong near the demilitarised zone, you are locked in an hotel 
complex made of old houses. The guides say it's the same outside the 
hotel. No, it’s not.'

Not impressed: 'This kind of picture is widespread in the West. The caption often points out that North Koreans have to eat grass. The guides get furious if you take it'

Duty:
 'People go to the country to do public projects. The regime used to see
 shots like these as positive but now they know that we interpret this 
as forced labour'

No
 flash: 'As we passed by these old buildings, the guides asked me not to
 shoot with flash. The official reason was “to avoid scaring people”'

Paranoia:
 'North Koreans are very paranoid. I was asked to delete the picture 
since the guides were certain I would have said those people were 
homeless - they were just resting'

Forbidden:
 The regime considers pictures showing smiles under portraits of the 
leadership to be disrespectful. 'Never take a picture where you can see 
people doing silly things in front of the Kim portraits,' says Lafforgue

Rare:
 'Although cars are becoming widespread in Pyongyang, peasants aren't 
used to seeing them. Kids play in the middle of the road just like when 
they didn't exist'

Luxury: 'You can find all kinds of food and drink in Pyongyang’s two supermarkets. They even have Evian water but only the elite can shop there'

Blackout: 'We were in Pyongyang art gallery when we experienced a power outage. When it happens, they tell you it’s because of the American embargo'

Irritating: 'Perhaps the most ridiculous prohibition of all. When I took the picture, everyone yelled at me. Since the painting was unfinished, I couldn’t take the picture'

Scared:
 'You are supposed to see fun at the Songdowon Children's Camp but some 
come from the country and are scared of escalators which they’ve never 
seen before'

'The best solution for the guides is to 
confiscate our cameras,' says Lafforgue. 'On the way to Chonjin, a new town opened up to tourists
three years ago, they just took my cameras and put them in a 
bag they kept. They can be very smart sometimes.'

But despite their best efforts, Lafforgue did manage to take these photos and as a result, has been banned from returning to North Korea by regime officials.

'I was disappointed as I think I tried to 
show more than just the clichés you hear about this country,' says Lafforgue of his travel ban. 'I was trying to speak to 
people, let them talk, show they are not robots and that they have families and a lot of culture.

'I tried to document North Korea in the same way I would any other country in the world, but for them to accept it, you really need to follow their rules and for me, some of those rules just weren't acceptable.'

Odd:
 'Officials took issue with this photo for two reasons: The teen is 
wearing his cap in a strange way (according to my guide), and there are 
soldiers in the background'

Multipurpose:
 'Pyongyang’s subway system is the deepest in the world as it doubles as
 a bomb shelter. I was told to delete this photo because it includes the
 tunnel'

Smarten
 up! 'The way you dress is very important in North Korea. When I asked 
to take a picture of these students, the girl insisted that the man 
straighten his shirt'

Ridiculous:
 'When you visit families, the guides love it if you take photos to show
 that kids have computers. But when they see there's no power, they ask 
you to delete!'

Exhausted:
 'You see a lot of tired people on the roadside, since many have to ride
 their bikes for hours to get to work. Taking pictures of them is 
forbidden.'

Eking
 a living: Although the regime has cracked down on the black market, the
 'grey market', to which officials turn a blind eye, allow some to 
scratch a living

Reparation:
 'North Korea says foreign aid is a war debt, but taking photos of the 
WFP sign through the window of a house in a village is forbidden'

Tough:
 'A rare example of an undisciplined kid in North Korea. The bus was 
driving in the small roads of Samijyon in the north, when this boy stood
 in the road'

Patient:
 'Queuing is a national sport for North Koreans,' says Lafforgue. This 
photo shows people waiting for a chance to catch the bus to work

Capital
 living: 'Pyongyang is the showcase of North Korea, so building 
exteriors are carefully maintained. When you look inside, the truth 
becomes apparent'
