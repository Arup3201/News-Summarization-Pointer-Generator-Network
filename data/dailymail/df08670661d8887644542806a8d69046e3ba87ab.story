Michael Clarke is a doubt for the Cricket World Cup in February after injuring his left hamstring during a One-Day International against South Africa on Friday.

The Australia skipper withdrew immediately from the series opening clash after suffering the same problem for the third time in six weeks.

And the injury not only casts doubt on his fitness for the rest of their series against the South Africans, but also next year's World Cup.

'I've had this injury three times in the same leg in the past six weeks,' said Clarke, who will undergo scans on Saturday. 'Whatever it takes for me to get back on the park, I'll do it.'

Clarke was out for 11, caught behind when he gloved an attempted pull shot off Dale Steyn's bowling, and slowly left the field.

It was the same problem that forced Clarke, who has a long history of lower back problems, out of the tri-series in Zimbabwe in September.

George Bailey stepped in as captain for the remainder of the match, and is likely to retain the job for the ODI series if Clarke is out long-term.
