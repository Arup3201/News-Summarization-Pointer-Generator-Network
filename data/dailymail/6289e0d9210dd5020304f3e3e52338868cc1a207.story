Crystal Palace have announced they will release 12 players once their contracts expire next month, but are in talks to prolong the stays of Julian Speroni, Marouane Chamakh and Kagisho Dikgacoi at the club.

The trio, who are out of contract, played an integral part in the club's impressive 11th place Premier League finish this season.

New deal: Crystal Palace are in talks to renew goalkeeper Julian Speroni's contract for next season

Free agent Speroni has been linked with a move to Sunderland, after the Black Cats expressed an interest in the 35-year-old goalkeeper.

Eagles duo Dean Moxey and Jonathan Parr are two of the casualties to be leaving Selhurst Park, as the club looks to continue to build for next season.

The full-backs have both featured in over 100 games for the club, during their three seasons in south London, and played a key role in helping Palace secure promotion to England's top flight during the 2012-13 campaign.

Wales international Danny Gabbidon is another defender who is not a part of boss Tony Pulis' plans next season.

The 34-year-old, who made 24 Premier League appearances for the Eagles, last featured for the club in their 1-0 win away to local rivals West Ham.

Striker Aaron Wilbraham is another casualty after his two-year Selhurst spell yielded two goals in 33 games.

The other players to be released are goalkeeper Neil Alexander, development strikers Osman Sow and Ibra Sekajja, as well as fellow youngsters Quade Taylor, Derek Tieku, Ross Fitzsimons, Tom King and Alistair Gordon.
