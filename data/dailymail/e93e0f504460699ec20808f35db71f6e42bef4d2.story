The murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez was temporarily stopped after a bomb threat was called in to the courthouse.

The threat was called in to the Fall River Justice Center in Massachusetts around noon on Thursday.

Proceedings were haled so the building could be evacuated.

Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh reminded reporters that taking photos of jurors was strictly prohibited 

During the temporary halt to the proceedings, the jurors, Hernandez's lawyers and prosecutors and Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh all stood on the street outside the courthouse, the Boston Globe reported. 

Garsh made it clear that photographs of the jurors would not be tolerated. 

She said: 'A picture of any juror is absolutely forbidden.'

Employees were let back into the building around 1pm and testimony was scheduled to resume at 2pm. 

Authorities do not believe the threat was related to Hernandez's trial. 

The district attorney's office said the bomb threat was called in to Taunton and Fall River superior courts simultaneously. 

Testimony in the Hernandez case began on January 29. 

Hernandez is accused in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of the football player's fiancee.

The judge said earlier Thursday that jailhouse calls in which Hernandez discusses giving money to a cousin could be used as evidence in the case.
