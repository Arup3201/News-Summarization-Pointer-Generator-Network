National Puppy Day took place yesterday and was easily the most coo-inducing day of 2015 with #NationalPuppyDay generating thousands of posts on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Even the biggest A-listers weren't immune to sharing a snap of their cute pooch with Kylie Jenner, Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande among those to upload a picture.

According to the official National Puppy Day website the purpose of the day is to celebrate the unconditional love that dogs bring into our lives but also to raise awareness of puppy mills in a mission to get puppy-free pet shops across the USA.

Yesterday was National Puppy Day which saw many people taking to the Internet to share pictures of their pooches with #NationalPuppyDay. Justin Bieber shared this snap of his new dog Esther

The day is also used as a way of encouraging the public to adopt orphaned puppies  with celebrities joining the cause with Kate Upton sharing an image on Instagram encouraging her followers to adopt rather than buy a puppy.
