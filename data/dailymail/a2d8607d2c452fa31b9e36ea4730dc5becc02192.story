A scowling cat who became an internet sensation known as the 'Grumpy Cat' has landed a Hollywood film deal.

The mixed breed cat achieved overnight fame last year after photos of her sour puss look went viral.

But that down in the dumps expression
has now helped the two-year-old family pet whose name is Tardar Sauce 
win a lucrative movie deal.

Hollywood producer Todd Garner plans 
to make a film featuring the permanently unhappy feline in which she 
will be given the power of speech in a family-orientated comedy.

Garner, who has worked on the Adam 
Sandler comedy 'Jack and Jill,' said: 'This started off as a picture of a
cat, but rare is an image that evokes that much comedy.

'You read all of the memes and the 
comments, and one is funnier than the next. We think we can build a big 
family comedy around this character.'

The Grumpy Cat's sour faced expression is caused by dwarfism and under bite.

A photo of the sour faced look was posted on the web by her owner Tabatha Bundesen.

It quickly went viral and the cat achieved almost one million 'likes' on her Facebook page.

She was featured on US TV and even interviewed by Time magazine.

Fans at the SXSW film and music festival in Texas queued for hours to meet the cat.

Hollywood talent agent Ben Lashes 
signed the cat as a client and helped negotiate the film deal for her 
owners from Morristown, Arizona.

He told the Wall St. journal his new client was unimpressed with deal - and even talk of lucrative merchandising spin-offs.

'She hates movies,' said Lashes.
