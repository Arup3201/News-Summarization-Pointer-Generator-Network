A Brazilian man claims he 'cried ink for two days' after getting his eyeballs tattooed to make them darker.

Tattoo artist Rodrigo Fernando dos Santos, 39, of Sao Paulo, decided to go ahead with the bizarre procedure after having already had 70 per cent of his body covered in ink.

The work involved a special syringe being used to inject the ink into the whites of his eyes.

Bizarre: Tattoo artist Rodrigo Fernando dos Santos, 39, decided covering his body in ink-work was just not enough - so he got his eyes done too

Painful: The whites of the tattoo artist's eyes are now darker than his pupils

The irreversible procedure involved using a syringe to inject ink into the sclera - the protective outer layer - of his eyes, 9News reports.

The ink used to inject his eye is believed to be the same used for tattoos on the rest of the body.

Eye specialists have advised against the procedure which some warn can cause inflammation and possibly even vision loss, according to 9News.

Eye tattooing is believed to be growing in popularity worldwide, with a tattoo artist in Australia claiming to be the first to have had the procedure done.

It is part of a trend for more 
unusual tattoos, with some women even having 'perfect' eyebrows and 
nipples tattooed onto them as a beauty treatment.

Tattooing goes back thousands of 
years, and has been a widespread practice across the globe, from the Pacific 
islands to northern Europe since ancient times.

It is currently enjoying a 
growth in popularity, with celebrities such as David Beckham setting the
 trend by having their bodies covered in ink-work.Â
