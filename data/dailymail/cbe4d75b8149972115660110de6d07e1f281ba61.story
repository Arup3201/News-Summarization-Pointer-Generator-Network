Louis Smith has a stark message for those who still think he has just ‘waltzed’ back into England’s Commonwealth Games gymnastics team after retiring and then winning the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing.

‘Louis is back,’ he says, leaning forward, intensity in his eyes. ‘Not the public kind of fame Louis, but the Louis who has trained for 21 years and got three Olympic medals. He’s back to kick some ass.’

In a candid interview, Smith has revealed his battle with depression in trying to cope with the glare of publicity after London 2012 and how hard it has been to regain his gymnastics status after losing sponsorship and Lottery funding.

Smith won Great Britain¿s first individual Olympic medal for 100 years in Beijing

The sequins of Saturday night TV have been stripped away and Smith, the gymnast who won Great Britain’s first individual Olympic medal for 100 years in taking bronze at the Beijing Games in 2008, is back on the pommel horse.

He retired after winning silver — having earned the same overall score as gold medallist Krisztian Berki of Hungary — and team bronze at London 2012, but started training again last December, shedding a stone in weight in the first three weeks before getting back on his favourite apparatus in mid-January.

At 25, however, Smith is no longer a ‘young pup’ in what is a young man’s sport. He insists it ‘was not hard’ to get back into shape after he piled on weight going on lads’ holidays, ‘buying a bottle of champagne in 10 seconds and drinking it and just enjoying life’ after the Olympics. But the rough, calloused surface of Smith’s palms reveal how much effort he has put in over the past seven months: they feel like sandpaper when you shake his hand.

‘There were loads of articles about “Louis being overweight” and “He’s looking fat” and all the rest of it,’ he says, ‘but it didn’t bother me too much because I knew if I really wanted to I could drop the weight that quick.

‘London definitely sapped me, emotionally and physically, so that’s why I needed the break after 2012 to end up falling back in love with gymnastics and really understand why I enjoy it.’

Smith admits he is ‘exhausted’, but talks about the tough, challenging environment of the gym as if it is a safe haven; a reassuring constant he has known throughout his life.

Yet when he first exploded into the public consciousness after the Beijing Olympics, aged only 19, that world suddenly changed, and he struggled to cope. Smith opens up about the ‘dark times’ of depression that afflicted him after winning a medal.

He describes his feelings at the time in the manner of someone else looking in, as if he still cannot marry the teenage Louis with the recognised star who had children queuing for autographs outside his mother Elaine’s house in Peterborough.

He said: ‘I went from being an 18-year-old kid who could go out, get drunk, eat a kebab with his mates, go to a party and try and snog some girl — just a normal lad — and suddenly I went to the Olympic Games, got a medal, came home and your life has completely changed, exploded.

‘I had responsibilities all of a sudden, I was a role model and I was freaking out. I didn’t know what to do. I got really depressed with it. It got to the point where I was going to the gym, I’d do my work, come back and I wouldn’t talk to anyone.

‘It was a real shock and it was hard — very, very hard and very emotional. You’re used to that old life and you kind of cling on to it. But you can’t have it.

‘That’s the bit that starts breaking you down: trying to hold on to what you had before because this new life is a bit alien and you’re not sure where to step. It was a really dark time.’

Six years on, Smith now speaks with the manner of a man much more comfortable in his own skin, able to joke about being called ‘an Olympic dancer’, yet clear in his own mind about his priorities. Life before London 2012 was a hectic merry-go-round of commercial appearances and training, but now all but one of his sponsors have gone and he no longer receives National Lottery funding.

He is doing this himself, and the hard way, having helped to inspire a renaissance in British Gymnastics that has seen more homegrown athletes become genuine contenders on the global stage.

Smith was not picked for this year’s European Championships and, although he is targeting next year’s Worlds and the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he knows selection for England at the Commonwealths is no guarantee of regaining a British vest. Smith is also fiercely conscious there are those, from within the sport and the wider public, who still see his comeback as a publicity stunt.

'I’m coming back into the sport, kind of alien,’ he says. ‘I haven’t been training from 2012, like the rest of the guys have. I’ve been seen as someone who has taken a break, gone off and done Strictly and shows and enjoyed the limelight.

‘I think some people might have thought me coming back was a publicity stunt and I wasn’t serious about it. I think they felt like I was undermining all the other gymnasts who were training hard. They thought, “How can he waltz in here and expect to take the place of someone who’s been training hard since 2012?”

‘I had to say a few things to raise a few eyebrows and say, “You know, I’m not messing around and you need to take me seriously”.

‘If I did well at the Commonwealth Games it would be bittersweet to certain people who perhaps don’t want to see me in the team, but there would be a lot of satisfaction for me, too.’ 

He suddenly smiles, unable to resist. ‘And I could do a salsa on the podium.’
