A woman who lost seven stone after seeing an awful photo of herself says her weight loss has also cured her asthma.

Elaine Aitken struggled to walk long distances without becoming breathless thanks to a stodgy diet of crisps, chocolate and fizzy drinks.

But after seeing an unflattering picture of herself taken by a work colleague she decided to join her local Slimming World class and ditched the fatty foods.

Elaine, 27, now has little need for her inhaler as her new healthy lifestyle has given her such a boost.

She said: 'I used to heavily rely on my inhaler but I don't really need it anymore.

'My condition used to be triggered by walking a fair distance but it's no longer an issue. I can even run now without getting out of breath.

'The job I do can be quite physical but I can do it now without becoming breathless.

'I had tried to lose weight before but it was always crash diets that never worked and I always ended up piling the weight back on.

'My colleague took a picture of me at work but when the picture was developed I was shocked.

'I knew I was overweight but it's true what they say - the camera never lies. I realised at that point that I needed to do something.'

Elaine, from Dunfermline in Fife, Scotland, joined her local Slimming World class with a friend in January 2011 and within 18 months she went from 19st 6lbs to 12st 5lbs.

After cutting out fatty foods and starting to exercise, her asthma improved so much that she now only needs her inhaler in cold winter weather.

Elaine also now finds her job as a care home worker much easier.

She said: 'Before, all I ate was rubbish. I wouldn't have any breakfast. I used to work in a nursery and there was a vending machine there and I used to just eat crisps and chocolate on my breaks.

'I used to have foods like cheesy pasta for dinner and drank a lot of fizzy juice. 'I didn't exercise at all. It was far from healthy.

'Now I'll usually have fruit or yogurts for breakfast, homemade soup for lunch and chicken, pasta or meat for dinner.

'I had tried to lose weight before but 
it was always crash diets that never worked and I always ended up piling
the weight back on.

Elaine said: 'I feel like a different person. My confidence has shot through the roof and I'm living life to the full'

'But I found it easy to make the change at Slimming World and I had great support from everyone else in the class.'

Elaine said her family, friends and colleagues who are all stunned by her new slimline figure.

She still attends the Slimming World class in Dunfermline and has no plans of quitting after her impressive weight loss.

She added: 'I feel like a different person. My confidence has shot through the roof and I'm living life to the full.

'My family and friends think it is brilliant. My colleagues also comment on my appearance all the time. They gave me huge support. I'm still going to classes and I'm still enjoying it.'

Slimming World consultant Ann Shankland said: 'We are so proud of Elaine. She is an absolute star.

'It's amazing how many people come to the group to lose weight for confidence and to look better and end up improving their health dramatically.'
