Frank Thornton, the actor best known for playing Captain Peacock in Are You Being Served?, has died at the age of 92.

The innuendo-laden BBC sitcom was one of the most successful in television history, running from 1972 to 1985 and attracting audiences of more than 20million. 

As the stern and pompous floorwalker, Thornton’s character had the near-impossible task of keeping order among his colleagues in the fictional department store, Grace Brothers.

His co-stars included John Inman, 
Mollie Sugden, Wendy Richard and Trevor Bannister.

Thornton’s passing – 
he died peacefully in his sleep on Saturday – means that Nicholas 
Smith, who played manager Mr Rumbold, is the last surviving member of 
the original regular cast.

Yesterday Smith praised Thornton, 
saying: ‘He was the best actor in Are You Being Served?’ It was a 
fitting tribute to a performer whose deadpan style mde him the perfect 
comic foil.

Thornton, who also starred in Last of 
the Summer Wine, began his acting career after enrolling in evening 
classes at the London School Of Dramatic Art while working for an 
insurance firm.

He joined Donald Wolfit’s theatre 
company in 1941, where he met the actress Beryl Evans, whom he married 
in 1946.

After serving as an officer in the RAF during the Second World 
War, he landed his first film role in the 1954 crime thriller, Radio Cab
Murder.

In the 1960s, he moved into comedy shows, appearing alongside stars such as Benny Hill and Frankie Howerd.

Thornton’s screen credits include 
the 1973 film No Sex Please, We’re British, and the 1977 Are You Being 
Served? movie spin-off which transported the cast to the fictional 
Spanish resort of Costa Plonka. He reprised the role of Captain Peacock 
in the TV sequel Grace and Favour.

In 1997 he took the role of Herbert 
‘Truly’ Truelove in Last of the Summer Wine, replacing Brian Wilde, who 
had suggested him for the role. He stayed with the show until it ended 
in 2010.

In 1984 he was nominated for an 
Olivier award for his role  in  Me and My Girl. His agent David Daly 
said yesterday: ‘Frank has been the most wonderful client as well as 
being a great friend. He will be sorely missed.’ Comedian Julian Clary 
wrote on Twitter: ‘RIP dear, lovely Frank Thornton.’

Thornton is survived by Beryl, daughter Jane and three grandchildren.
