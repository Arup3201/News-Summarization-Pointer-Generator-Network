Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho were among eight senior players missing from the squad when Liverpool’s flight touched down in Istanbul on Wednesday.

Gerrard misses out on a return to the Ataturk Stadium – the scene of his greatest moment as Liverpool captain in the 2005 Champions League final – as Brendan Rodgers’s side prepare to defend their 1-0 first-leg lead against Besiktas on Thursday night.

The veteran midfielder has not played for two weeks due to a hamstring problem, and has been left on Merseyside in a bid to be fit for Sunday’s clash with Manchester City.

Coutinho has been rested to help him be in peak condition to face the champions at Anfield after playing in all of Liverpool’s last 19 games. Lazar Markovic is still suspended while Jordan Henderson, Glen Johnson, Jose Enrique, Mamadou Sakho and Lucas are all injured, meaning there could be a youthful look to Liverpool for the second leg.

‘We’ve got a few injuries,’ said Rodgers. ‘We’re probably out here without eight of our squad who have knocks, some with previous and some who picked up something at the weekend.

‘We still have a squad strong enough to hopefully get the job complete. But we’ ve got a few knocks and niggles from the weekend.

‘The confidence is very high in the team and the changes we make and the players that come in, they know their collective jobs. They’re performing at a very high level so we expect that confidence level to continue and to carry that into the game.’

Gerrard is the only current Liverpool player to have appeared in the famous victory over AC Milan at the Ataturk when they came from three goals down to beat the Italians in a penalty shootout.

‘Of course it was a great historic night for the club and everyone associated with Liverpool respects that,’ added Rodgers. ‘It was a little while ago and there won’t be too many of our players that were involved at that time.

‘It’s a real iconic stadium for the club and a big part of that history. For us to go there and play with a lot of young players and a new squad against a good team, we’ll look forward to that.

‘It’s obviously a big pitch that suits us. If you look at the size of the field, in terms of the Premier League it would be the third biggest pitch.

‘So in terms of the pace and movement in our team, the pitch should suit us quite. We’re looking forward to the atmosphere and we want to get the job complete.’

Mario Balotelli’s late penalty gave Liverpool victory in the first leg after he took the ball off Henderson to score the decisive goal, and Rodgers is confident that his team will finish the job in Istanbul. They are playing with renewed confidence having won seven of their last eight games away from home.

Asked by local reporters if Liverpool were lucky at Anfield last week, he replied: ‘No I don’t think so. Besiktas had two shots on our goal and our goalkeeper had to make one save of note. Simon Mignolet made a very good save from Demba Ba but apart from that we dominated the game.

‘But we respect our opponents. We haven’t arrived in Turkey being arrogant enough to think it will be comfortable. We understand it will be a difficult game but this is a team that is playing very well away from home, not just at Anfield. Away from home we’re performing extremely well. This is another challenge to that but we look forward to it.’

Sterling insists the atmosphere in Istanbul won't be any more intimidating than Anfield

England international Raheem Sterling insists Liverpool’s young side are well equipped to handle a typically hostile atmosphere in Turkey.

‘The support in Turkey looks incredible,’ said Sterling. ‘It’s going to be a really exciting game, for me personally as well, because I’ve always wanted to play in Turkey and see what the fans are like.

‘Everyone says how amazing they are. People say “you might get intimidated” but I think the fans at Anfield are quite intimidating as well. So I don’t think it will be too different.

‘Coming away to play in Turkey, it’s going to be difficult and we know that. We’ ve got to stick to our game plan that the manager has set out for us. We’ll be trying to play possession football and attacking football at the same time.’
