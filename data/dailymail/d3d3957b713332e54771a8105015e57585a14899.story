Harry Kane scored a hat-trick before standing in as an inept emergency goalkeeper. But his chaotic game was merely a secondary tale.

This match, this night, belonged to Erik Lamela and his brilliant ‘rabona’ goal. The Argentine cost Tottenham £30million. His goal might well be replayed more than 30 million times. Everyone at White Hart Lane had to do a double-take. Words cannot do it justice. Just watch it.

‘You could probably find a video on YouTube of me scoring a goal like that,’ joked Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino. ‘It was a big goal, a great goal, an unbelievable goal. I’m very happy for him to score a goal like this.

‘Was it the best goal scored by one of my teams in my career? Probably, yes. He practises it every day in training. It’s a goal only a player with his skill can score.’

In a strange way, Asteras Tripolis were happy Lamela scored such a sensational goal against them, possibly the best moment produced by a Spurs player since Gareth Bale ripped Inter Milan to pieces. 

From the outset, the Greeks looked happy just to be at White Hart Lane, soaking in the occasion by taking selfies on the pitch and mingling with travelling supporters ahead of kick-off.

They did create the first clear opportunity when Pablo Mazza bore down on Hugo Lloris’s goal, but, under pressure from Jan Vertonghen, dragged his strike horribly wide.

Kane then followed suit, firing a long-range effort wide 30 seconds later. The Greeks should have heeded that warning, though, as Kane put Spurs ahead from a similar position. 

Picking up the ball 25 yards out, the England Under 21 star unleashed a right-foot rocket that flew past Tomas Kosicky in the 13th minute.

Yet, the Greeks refused to hide, going close to an equaliser in the 26th minute after Thanasis Panteliadis’ header from Martin Rolle’s deep free-kick flew narrowly wide. They went even closer two minutes later, Ben Davies clearing Facundo Parra’s effort off the line after a rare error by Lloris.

But then came a moment that will become an internet sensation as Lamela brought the house down with his wondrous goal — not that you would have guessed from the reaction of Pochettino, who sat motionless on the bench.

‘I never show emotion when we score,’ he said. ‘I always try to stay calm — but when I see it again I will enjoy it.’

He certainly will. Maybe, Lamela can finally start to consistently show the undoubted talent that prompted Spurs to break their transfer record to sign him from Roma last summer.

Yet, just six minutes later, he showed the inconsistency that has been a source of frustration. As Spurs broke after a Asteras corner, Lamela needed only to play a simple pass to put Emmanuel Adebayor free on goal. 

Instead, he passed to Kane, who was offside. Pochettino was livid.

Andros Townsend saw a 30-yard strike fly inches wide in the 40th minute and Lamela’s deflected drive from the edge of the box bounced wide during the opening stages of the second half.

The first reported rabona was by Ricardo Infante in Argentina in a game between Estudiantes de la Plata and Rosario Central in 1948. Football magazine El Grafico then set up a front cover showing Infante dressed as a pupil with the caption 'Infante played hooky' ('rabona' in Spanish means to play hooky or to skip school). Hence, the rabona was born.

But it proved to be the Argentine’s night as he increased the advantage in the 65th minute with an excellently executed left-foot volley that flew past Kosicky.

That was far from the end of the action, however, as Kane’s night ended in a whirlwind.

He grabbed his second from close range after Kosicky failed to hold Mousa Dembele’s effort in the 75th minute and completed his hat-trick nine minutes from time by heading home Federico Fazio’s cross. 

But the drama wasn’t over for Kane as he was forced to the spend the final three minutes in goal after Lloris was sent off for bringing down Tsos Tsokanis. 

And the forward made a complete hash of dealing with Jeronimo Barrales’s free-kick, letting the effort go under his body as the Greeks grabbed a late consolation. 

On the red card, Pochettino added: ‘I think Hugo was correct, but unlucky because it was a red card.

‘But I am not happy with the last minutes because our defensive line was very high and we gave them the possibility to play in behind our defensive line.’

Who said the Europa League was boring?
