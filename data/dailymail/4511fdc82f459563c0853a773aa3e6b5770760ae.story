A stripper faces live in prison for being filmed sexually abusing a toddler and having sex with a dog after being indicted Thursday. 

Angeline Lodice, of New Orleans, Louisiana, was arrested in October after the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office obtained videos and photos that showed her engaging in intercourse with a canine and sexually abusing a 4-year-old boy.

She has been charged with aggravated rape of a victim under the age of 13, pornography involving juveniles, crimes against nature and sexual battery.

Defense attorney Martin Regan told The Times-Picayune that his clients plans to plead not guilty by reason of insanity.

'I anticipate she'll undergo both psychiatric and psychological evaluations,' he said.

She is being held on an $800,000 bond as set by Judge Scott Schlegel.

While she faces a life sentence if found guilty, should the court decide she was insane at the time of the crimes, she would be held indefinitely at a state mental hospital for treatment.

Should the court agree that she is mentally ill, she'll be sentenced to treatment at a state mental hospital where she would be held indefinitely 

According to a police report obtained by The Times-Picayune, Lodice, 26, has admitted that the woman in the photos and video are her, but she did not identify the boy as she claims she was drugged.

The abuse came to light after the father of the child was contacted by a relative of Lodice, who said he received photographs and videos of her and the child.

She is currently being held at Jefferson Parish Correctional Center. 

The aggravated rape charges carry a sentence of life in prison without parole while the sexual battery and pornography charges each carry a sentences of a minimum of 25 years and maximum of 99 if convicted.  

Lodice, who also goes by Angel, is a tattoo artist according to her Twitter account.
