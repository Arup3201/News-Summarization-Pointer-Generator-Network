Sir Ian Botham, England’s greatest all-round cricketer, was conspicuous in his lack of visible support for cricket’s big charity day at The Oval.

Cricket United, which supports the game’s major charities — Lord’s Taverners, Chance to Shine and the PCA benevolent fund — dressed The Oval in light blue on Saturday to promote the causes. But Botham, who ironically was knighted mainly for his huge contribution in raising money for charity, was the one regular Sky commentator on screen not wearing a light blue tie on the day.

Cricket United gave ties the day before to Sky cricket producer Brian Henderson for his commentary team to wear. But Botham preferred to sport the colours of Scunthorpe United, the Football League team for whom he made 11 appearances.

Meanwhile, Indian motorcycle firm Hero were the only company with a perimeter advertising board at The Oval for the Test who did not change to a light blue colour on Saturday. A Cricket United spokesman said: ‘We had a tie for Sir Ian but it’s entirely up to him whether he chooses to wear it on screen and we were very grateful when he did so last year. As for Hero, they gave us no reason why they didn’t want the change.’

The row simmers on between senior Rabbi Yisroel Fine and ECB chairman Giles Clarke as to who said what about England all-rounder Moeen Ali wearing ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ wristbands during the third Test against India.

Rabbi Fine remains furious with Clarke’s version of their conversation — claiming he never threatened to resign from the MCC. He also berated Clarke, a fluent Arabic speaker who went to university in Damascus, for politicising the issue by criticising Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 

Fine said: ‘Giles Clarke has forfeited any credibility as an unbiased chairman of the ECB by portraying his political prejudices.’ Clarke said: ‘There are two sides to every ghastly story and Rabbi Fine launched a tirade at me about Gaza. It was a humanitarian gesture by Moeen that has been sensitively handled, with the players themselves voting not to publicise political messages on the pitch and that should be the end of the matter.’

Online giants Google and Yahoo are both showing interest in covering the live international cricket that has been put out to tender by the ICC. 

World cricket’s ruling body have controversially split the live rights for the 50-over World Cup, Champions Trophy and T20 World Cup between television and digital in the next contract, starting in 2015.

This would mean a far greater viewing reach for the sport, especially in India and North America. But the strategy has upset both BT and Sky, who wanted the opportunity to bid for both rights and not have exclusivity diluted by worldwide online availability.

It will certainly affect the British TV companies’ bids for the competitions and the money that trickles down to the English counties as a result of the revamped ICC governance.

The England Cricket Board’s attempts to promote women’s cricket have not been helped by Edgbaston’s hosting of a T20 double-header. England men play India on September 7 on the final day of their dismal tour, after the England women’s team have taken on South Africa.

Yet the women’s match has not been mentioned on the tickets. Warwickshire blame the omission on uncertainty about the opponents, although the ECB say the women’s match was first discussed in February.

Explanation: Friends of Ray Wilkins say his slurred commentary during Arsenal's win against Crystal Palace was due to medicine he takes to help him fight ulcerative colitis and depression

Ray Wilkins's slurred speech during his co-commentary stint for talkSPORT on Arsenal’s late win against Crystal Palace sparked social media claims that the former England star was the worse for wear.

Wilkins, following previous allegations about his drink troubles, revealed in Sportsmail last February that he was fighting ulcerative colitis and bouts of depression. 

And it is the medicines he takes to combat those serious ailments that make him slur his words. Friends say that was the problem Wilkins had to contend with at the Emirates Stadium.
