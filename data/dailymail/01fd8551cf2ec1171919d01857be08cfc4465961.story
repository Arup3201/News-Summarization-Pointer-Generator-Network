A wealthy Manhattan couple who divorced nearly a decade ago is locked in a bitter court battle over money he says she pilfered under the guise it was for a nanny.

Henry Owsley, CEO of The Gordon Group, a boutique investment bank, is suing ex-wife Danica Cordell-Reeh for nearly $3million dollars – the $263,000 she stole and another $2.5million in punitive damages, according to court documents.

Their 2000 separation agreement required Owsley to reimburse his former spouse for nanny expenses for the couple’s twins, as well as child support, private school tuition and health care, the New York Daily News reported.

Nanny payments started at about $80,000 per year but slowly decreased to only $13,000 as the children aged.

Owsley abided by the agreement despite being told by his children there was hardly ever a caretaker around, according to the suit.

The twins are now 17-years-old.

Two years ago Owsley discovered Cordell-Reeh had spent nearly $180,000 givn to her for a nanny without ever having hired on, the filing said.

Cordell-Reeh’s attorney told the Daily News he was ‘quite surprised.

‘Her children are turning 18 in January, and he wants to get involved in 10 more years of litigation.’

Owsley filed the suit Wednesday in Manhattan Supreme Court, his attorney declined comment to the paper.
