Shoplifters are being sent to food banks as part of a crackdown on crime as police raise concerns that hunger is behind the rising number of offences across Britain.

Police chiefs around the country have raised concerns over a sharp rise in the numbers of first-time offenders stealing from supermarkets.

Quarterly crime figures due to be released next week are expected to show an increasing number of shoplifting offences recorded by 37 of Britain's 43 police forces, according to The Times.

However, the country's overall crime rate is falling as the success of London's Metropolitan Police - which accounts for around 20 per cent of all recorded crime - is obscuring rising figures in other areas.

According to The Times the new figures from the Office for National Statistics will show that crime in the capital has fallen by around six per cent, while other forces experience a rise.

'Without this progress in London, it 
might not be possible for the Home Office to laud a national crime 
reduction this year,' London's deputy mayor for policing and crime Stephen Greenhalgh told the newspaper.

In 2012-13 there were 36,500 shoplifting offences in the capital, compared with 42,000 in 2009-10.

Mr Greenhalgh said Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe should be credited for the falling crime rate.

'Criminals here are on the back foot 
because the cops are working harder and smarter, not because more people
 are in work,' he added.

Help: North Wales PCC Winston Roddick said arrested shoplifters would be directed to food banks in the hope that ensuring people were not hungry would reduce the number of thefts

Assistant Commissioner Helen King, from the Metropolitan Police Service, said: 'We are committed to cutting crime, with burglary at its lowest in 40 years and robbery at its lowest in 15 years. We’ve also had some excellent results in tackling gangs, weapon-related crime and youth violence.

'This has been achieved as a result of a lot of hard work by our officers across London with the support from our partners and the public to bring offenders to justice and improve our service to victims.

'We are moving in the right direction, but there’s still a great deal of work to do to cut crime further. I hope the people of London will be reassured by these successes and our commitment to making our city a safe and great place to be.'

But while the capital is leading the country's economic recovery, police in other areas have blamed austerity for rising numbers of shoplifting offences.

In North Wales instances of shoplifting have increased by 21.7 per cent compared with last year, and the area's police and crime commissioner said such thefts now accounted for 10 per cent of all crime in the region.

Winston Roddick said he believed hunger is an underlying cause of the offences, and told business leaders at a meeting last week that arrested shoplifters would be directed to food banks in the hope that ensuring people were not hungry would reduce the number of thefts.

'Officers tell me that interviews of offenders and 
analysis of types of items stolen suggest many offences are committed to
 raise money to feed a drug habit or to obtain food,' he told the North Wales 
Business Club and the Institute of Directors.

Research from The Trussell Trust suggests that the number of adults and children using food banks has now exceeded 900,000.

The charity said that 913,000 people, 330,205 of them children, had received at least  three-days' emergency help during 2013-14, with researchers claiming the 162 per cent jump in people seeking assistance is due to rising living 
costs combined with low pay and problems over welfare payments.

The Trussell Trust now has more than 400 food banks across the UK, and aims to have one in every town.

The banks were opening at a rate of two a week to cope with the number of people facing food shortages, but this is now down to one.

The government introduced tougher rules aimed at benefit claimants last October including raising the minimum sanction for violations from one to four weeks.

More than 20 charities, including the Trussell Trust have written to the government accusing them of violating people's basic right to food.

However, the Department of Work and Pensions said it was the growth in the number of food banks which has increased demand rather than new benefit regulations.

A letter signed by 600 church leaders including 36 Anglican bishops earlier this year called on the Government to deal with what it described as a ‘national crisis’ of poverty and people living below the bread line.

But their concerns contradict findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which show food poverty in Britain has reduced dramatically.

Only 8.1 per cent reported struggling to afford food in 2012 – down from 9.8 per cent in 2007, before the economic crisis.

'More work is required to quantify the impact which the current economic climate and benefit changes are having on crime levels.

'In
 the meantime, work is taking place to identify the location and 
operating hours of food banks and other support services. This 
information will then be made available in local communities and handed 
to those arrested for shoplifting.'

Mr Roddick added that stores would be encouraged to issue civil banning orders for offenders as part of a crack down on shoplifting.

Earlier this year Northumbria's PCC Vera Baird blamed welfare cuts for a rise in shoplifting by women., saying there was growing evidence that women were being driven to steal nappies and food because they were getting fewer benefits.

Referring to crime figures in the North-East, the 
senior barrister declared: ‘At the end of last year, it was apparent 
that people were starting to steal items they could once afford.

'There’s
 been growing evidence to suggest this is due to the impact of both 
poverty and welfare reform, with people stealing what they were once 
able to take for granted and just go out and buy.

‘The growth in 
the number of first-time women shoplifting offenders would suggest it’s 
affecting the poorer women in our communities, those who are 
experiencing the impact of the welfare reforms.’

Adrian Curtis, the foodbank network for the Trussell Trust - a charity which co-ordinates the only nationwide network of food banks in the country - said police had referred people to its food banks, but not necessarily for shoplifting.

'For many years our food banks have partnered with a wide variety of local organisations, whether that's charities or the police,' he told MailOnline.

'From time to time they will see people in genuine crisis who have no option but to go to food banks, they could be the victims of crime, and we trust the judgement of people who refer them to us.

'They may be stealing for different reasons, and with regards to what the PCC was saying, he's talking I would presume about basic items such as bread and milk rather than high end electricals.

'We would trust the police's judgement to sign post people to charities who are best place to support people in a variety of crises.'

He added: 'I have launched a food bank in South Wales, we partner with the local police team and from time to time we get referrals but very very few have been down to shoplifting.

'Over the years we have fed more than 10,000 people and less than a handful have come to us with shoplifting issues.

'We have seen an elderly person come to us after committing shoplifting, who was incredibly embarrassed and it was the first time they had committed and offence. They were embarrassed to ask for help.'

Figures from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, released in April, showed that crime in England and Wales fell by 15 per cent last year compared with 2012.

The survey, which tracks all crimes committed by interviewing victims, and as a result includes offences not reported to the police, showed there were 7.5million offences in 2013, down from almost 9million in 2012.

There was a 22 per cent fall in household theft, a 15 per cent fall in vandalism and a 4 per cent drop in burglary.

However, fraud rose by 25 per cent and shoplifting was up 6 per cent.

The Home Office has not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.
