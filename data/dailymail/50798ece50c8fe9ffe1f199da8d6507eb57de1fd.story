There was a moment when David Beckham had just joined LA Galaxy that he decided to take a wander into town.

An amble around your new surroundings, especially those as glitzy as Los Angeles, would be commonplace for most people. For Beckham, it can potentially cause hysteria.

At LA Galaxy they were still unsure, at the time of his arrival, just how big Golden Balls would be in America.

David Beckham's move to LA Galaxy in 2007 paved the way for Premier League stars crossing the Atlantic 

The reaction was ginormous as hundreds of reporters and photographers turned up to LA for him

Beckham thought he would gauge the reaction and told a member of club staff he was popping out for a bit. ‘Don’t you think you should take that off?’ they asked, wide-eyed with surprise and pointing to his LA Galaxy training top.

Beckham smiled. ‘Yes, this is what I’m going to get recognised for…’ the most famous face on the planet jokingly replied.

For Major League Soccer, Beckham was just the start. Back when he signed, in July 2007, Beckham was surprised by the comparatively low-budget hotels and flights, when he had grown accustomed to exclusive accommodation and private jets.

But his move paved the way for Thierry Henry, Robbie Keane and Tim Cahill, amongst many other global names, and change is in the air stateside.

When Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard cross the Atlantic this summer, the league is a very different one to when Beckham blazed the trail eight years ago.

MLS has a long way to go until it is as big as American Football in the US, but Lampard, set to join New York City, and Gerrard, on his way to LA Galaxy, will carry on Beckham’s crusade when they arrive.

Beckham made 118 appearances for LA Galaxy in his five years at the club, scoring 20 goals

Chicago Fire manager Frank Yallop, who was in charge of LA Galaxy when Beckham brought the circus to town, explains: ’Everyone’s got a football team in England. Over in the US, everyone’s got an American Football team. It’s huge, the biggest sport. That’s like the Premier League in England.

‘Lampard and Gerrard coming over is massive. It will get people supporting clubs. They’re watching them in the Premier League on a Saturday morning on TV, now they can go watch them live. Then when they travel to another city the fans there can watch Lampard and Gerrard play live. It’s only going to help.

‘It’s part of the package they bring. These teams can really generate some interest with them. They’re great players, but they’ve got great names. It’s a big move.

‘We just need to get the American general public really interested, like they are in England. It’s coming.

Another addition to the MLS after Beckham was Thierry Henry, arguably the Premier League's greatest player

‘It’s getting to that point when it’s going to take off, like when Sky got involved with the Premier League in the 1990s.’

The MLS are seeking that big-money TV deal and there are rumours that Sky might be bidding to screen MLS games live to the UK.

There is a long, long way to go to get anywhere near the £5.1billion deal recently reached over here, but names like Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard carry obvious allure for the English market.

Even so, the pair may have to get used to slightly lower than the premium standards they have become accustomed to at their clubs since they were teenagers.

‘I think Beckham was surprised by the level of hotel, the level of travel,’ Yallop, who played more than 300 games for Ipswich Town and has won the MLS Cup and coach of the Year twice, says.

Henry joined New York Red Bulls in 2010 and played his final game for the club in December 2014 

Frank Lampard followed suit by announcing he was joining New York City after being released by Chelsea

‘It was what we were used to. When he came, it opened our eyes up, we realised if we want to move this up a level we needed to start getting serious. Now everything is top notch.

‘It’s not always first class, but it’s always good flights. Some teams charter once in a while. Hotels are excellent.’

Yallop was shocked just how big Beckham was when he signed. For a long time, they would have 300 television cameras, from all parts of the globe, at each press conference.

During games, the usual few photographers dotted on the side of the pitch were swamped by 250.

‘The league wasn’t quite ready for what David brought,’ Yallop admits, ‘which was huge interest from outside of football, too.

‘It’s very good, but for our team it was crazy for a bit. David’s getting pulled all over for interviews and commercials. The team’s exposed to a bunch of stuff they’re not used to, Hollywood-type stuff. It was fun, but a real crazy, difficult to coach and manage time.’

Now, it is a different story. ‘They’re ready for Lampard and Gerrard,’ he adds.

Lampard, currently on loan at Manchester City, will join up with his new teammates in the summer 

Steven Gerrard announced he will exit Liverpool at the end of the season and will also join LA Galaxy
