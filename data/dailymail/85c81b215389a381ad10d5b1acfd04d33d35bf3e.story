Rankings of the finest practitioners in sport always carry the heaviest weight at the year’s end. And so, after much deliberation over the turkey and Chrismtas pudding, we come to this column’s listing of the top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in both the world and the United Kingdom in 2014.

WORLD RANKINGS

1) FLOYD MAYWEATHER – still the No 1 man, in the pay-per-view as well as pound-for-pound ratings, despite a non-vintage year compromising two typically proficient, matador-like handlings of Marcos Maidana’s bull-rushes from the Argentinian pampas

2) MANNY PACQUIAO - back to dazzling form in 2014, first avenging the travesty of last year’s decision gifted to Tim Bradley by the Las Vegas judges, then seeing off new young champion Chris Algieri by the basketball score of 120-102. Time, surely, for the PacMan and Money man to finally get it on in 2015.

Floyd Mayweather is still, pound-for-pound, the No 1 fighter in the boxing world at the moment

3) GENNADY GOLOVKIN – once the most ducked fighter in the world, now demonstrating why as three more stoppages in 2014 give the Kazakh assassin the highest knock-out percentage in the history of the classic middleweight division. Our own Martin Murray never dodges anyone but he had better duck the biggest of Golovkin’s punches in Monte Carlo on February 21.

4) WLADIMIR KLITSCHKO – credit, please, where credit is due as the Ukraine’s gentleman ambassador to world boxing moves ever close to the longest reign in heavyweight history.

5) ROMAN GONZALEZ – the Nicaraguan sensation may be small but is perfectly formed and can be ignored in these lists no longer, as this current Ring and WBC flyweight champion rides an unblemished record of 41 wins including 35 K0s up through the divisions towards more world titles

6) GUILLERMO RIGONDEAUX – Cuba’s former amateur superstar continues to gain admiration from the purists, if not the blood-lusters, as the 14 all-win world light-featherweight champion with the WBA, WBO and Ring magazine.

7) JUAN MANUEL MARQUEZ – still, at 41, the Mexican to be reckoned with in the Mayweather-Pacquiao firmament, if his wonky knee does not force him into retirement.

8) CARL FROCH – although Amir Khan is knocking on the top 10 door now, the Nottingham Cobra remains our only presence in the world ratings by virtue of his devastating KO of George Groves in that Wembley Stadium spectacular. And he’s up one place.

9) TIM BRADLEY – has not seemed the same man since Pacquiao took his revenge for that miscarriage of justice – but that is still the only defeat on his record and he clings on at ninth

10) VASYL LOMACHENKO – the genius amateur from Ukraine rockets into my top 10 after only four pro fights, having won the WBO world featherweight title in the third of those, then commandingly defended it against a 52-1 former world champion from Thailand despite breaking a hand in the third round. Overnight, a star is born.

*Andre Ward, who would otherwise have ranked third here, last defended his WBA super-middleweight crown in November 2013 so is excluded due to inactvity throughout 2014.

UK RANKINGS

1) FROCH – see world rankings

2) AMIR KHAN – two huge away wins over Americans in 2014 – a three knock-down drubbing of Luis Collazo and this month’s dazzling triumph over Devon Alexander without the loss of a round on my card – have reasserted Khan’s place in this list and alongside Mayweather and Pacquiao among the top three welterweights on the planet. Has also shown great courage in going to Pakistan to help finance rebuilding the school where that ghastly massacre took place – after publicly branding extremist Islamic violence ‘a disgrace’ to his religion.

3) KELL BROOK – until Khan’s master-outclassing of Alexander, Special K was second in my book courtesy of his own big win in the US to take the IBF world welterweight title from the big-punching Shaw Porter. May he enjoy a speedy recovery from being stabbed while on holiday after that gutsy performance.

4) CARL FRAMPTON – the Belfast Jackal turned huge potential into a world super-bantamweight title with his victory over Kiko Martinez. The dramatic setting was the Titanic Quarter in the home city where, like his legendary mentor Barry McGuigan, he is building bridges across the religious divide

5) JAMES DeGALE – delivering, at last, on his Olympic gold medal fame and looks to have edged just ahead of his bitter London foe Groves in the super-middleweight line of succession to Froch.

6) GEORGE GROVES – has looked a trifle vulnerable in his two fights since being struck down by Froch at Wembley – perhaps having got back in the saddle too quickly after that concussive fall. But has the world-class ability to recover, perhaps in a classic rematch with DeGale

7) SCOTT QUIGG – continues to grow into his status as WBA ‘regular’ world champion and is itching to establish bragging rights over Frampton in a unification Battle of Britain, hopefully in 2015.

8) OLA AFOLABI – has not fought in his native Britain since blitzing Enzo Maccarinelli back in 2009 but his on-going campaign in America and Germany has survived a tough trilogy with WBO cruiserweight king Marco Huck – one draw, two narrow defeats – and not only brought him the IBO belt but also set-up big unification matches in the new year

9) MARTIN MURRAY – still the tough bench-mark for all UK middleweights with only one loss on his record, and that a defeat in Buenos Aires by Argentinian maestro Sergio Martinez which was as debatable as his other world title setback, a draw versus Arthur Abraham in Germany. Will be a huge underdog against Golovkin in Monte Carlo in February but be sure he will put up one helluva fight

10) JAMIE McDONNELL - in this young man’s case, what goes up may come back down, happily. Having landed his world title by going up to bantamweight to successfully end the Stuart Hall fairytale, is considering an attempt at the rare double of dropping down a division to win at super-featherweight

*Andy Lee, UK-born world middleweight champion thanks to his sensational stoppage of Matt Korobov in Las Vegas, prefers to fight as an Irishman so does not qualify for this list.

Stand by for not only a Happy New Year but a vintage 2015 in the ring.
