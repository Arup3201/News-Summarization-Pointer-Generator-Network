The girlfriend of David de Gea has dealt a blow to Manchester United's hopes of keeping him by describing his adopted city as 'not very nice'.

Singer Edurne Garcia, Spain's Eurovision Song Contest entrant, made the comments on light entertainment show El Hormiguero.

Host Pablo Motos asked her: 'I've been told Manchester is uglier than the back of a fridge.'

Garcia told Spanish entertainment show El Hormiguero that Manchester is 'not very nice, that's for sure'

And rather than leap to the defence of the city where her boyfriend plies his trade, the 29-year-old replied: 'It's not very nice, that's for sure. You have to hunt out specific places, the nice places.

'But even then Spain is nicer. The reason I like it is because David's there. With him being there, everything looks wonderful.'

De Gea, 24, sees his contract expire at Old Trafford at the end of next season.

The 29-year-old singer has fueled speculation that De Gea could be set for a future away from Manchester

The keeper has once again been in superb form after a shaky start to his career with the club following his £18.9m switch from Atletico Madrid in 2011.

He has been strongly linked with a summer move to Real Madrid and Garcia's comments led to speculation she will pressure him to return to his home city.

In December, senior officials at United said they were relaxed about his contract situation.

Last month De Gea dismissed rumours of a rift between himself and manager Louis van Gaal as 'lies' but stopped short of committing his future to United.
