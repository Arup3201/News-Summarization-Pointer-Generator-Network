An unassuming object has appeared on the shopping list of Chinese nouveau riches: Japanese toilet seats.

According to People’s Daily, Chinese shoppers swarmed into stores in Japan during the Chinese New Year holidays and bought up all electronic toilet seats in stock.

But while those who trade in luxury bathroom gadgets were celebrating in Japan, the demand for lavatories with 'built-in cheek warmers' has sparked condemnation in China - with even the prime minister entering the debate.

The furore was sparked when it was discovered that these toilet seats were made in China - but only available to Chinese people who are prepared to fly abroad. 

It’s been joked online that these seats went on a ‘self-guided tour to Japan just like their new owners’.

Some Chinese tourists to Japan bought as many as five toilet seats without checking the price beforehand, wrote Wu Xiaobo, a renowned Chinese columnist, in one article.  

'Toilet seat' has since become an internet buzzword in China. The other popular items Chinese shoppers buy in Japan are rice cookers and rice (imagine the weight of the luggage).

'As long as Chinese tour groups are here, toilet seats will go out of stock,' said a shopkeeper in Japan in Mr Wu’s article.

Advanced toilet seats from brands such as Panasonic are regarded as the representation of Japanese technology in China and are a status symbol to own.

Functions: From spray washing to blow drying to massaging, a Japanese toilet seats can do it all

A separate article lists 14 different functions a typical Japanese toilet seat has, which includes spray washing, blow drying, massaging and auto-deodorisation. These seats are reported to be compatible with all toilets.

A sales representative from Panasonic told People’s Daily that such toilet seats are common in Japan and appear in public toilets too.

He said Chinese buyers were not familiar with the product in the past few years, but once they found out the benefits and found the products affordable, they came to buy up all.

Eagle-eyed Chinese netizens have also found out that the packaging of some of the toilet seats were full of Chinese characters. They later found out that many seats were originally made in China in cities such as Hangzhou.

This has prompted public outcry over the reason why they travelled overseas to buy homemade products.

An experts on home electronics told People’s Daily that the only solution to restore Chinese shoppers’ confidence in buying in China is to eradicate low-quality made-in-China products once for all.

The buzzword also made its way to the ongoing Lianghui, the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

In responding to the news, China’s premier Li Keqiang said a more tolerant attitude and rights of choice should be given to consumers and that Chinese companies should strive to produce similar products.

'At least, (this) can save the flight fare for the consumers,' said Mr Li.
