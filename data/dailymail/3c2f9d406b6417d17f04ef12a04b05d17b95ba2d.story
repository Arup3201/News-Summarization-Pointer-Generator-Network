The couple could be heard saying 'I will' in the background before they shared their first kiss as a married couple.

And Frank lost his wife to thyroid cancer at around the same time. The pair got in touch with each other through a support group.

They were supposed to tie the knot in October but brought their wedding forward after being hand-picked by McBride to marry on stage.

McBride told People magazine: 'When I
read their story, I felt an emotional connection. They have been 
through so much and I just thought about what an honor it would be to 
share this moment with them.'
