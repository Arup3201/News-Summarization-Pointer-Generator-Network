Real Madrid's victory in the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday not only handed them their third trophy of 2014 - it also put them back level with bitter rivals Barcelona on 78 major titles.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Co have won the Champions League, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Super Cup so far this calendar year while Barcelona have not lifted a single trophy.

The Catalan giants had leapfrogged Real in the trophy stakes during Pep Guardiola's time in charge when they dominated Spanish and European football.
