Under fire: The High Street Innovation Fund, set up in response to Mary Portas's review of ailing town centres, allocated money to 100 councils

A £10 million pot of taxpayers' money designed to rejuvenate Britain's failing high streets has been criticised for being unfairly distributed.

The High Street Innovation Fund, set up 
in response to Mary Portas’s review of ailing town centres, allocated £100,000 to 100 councils.

The Government said the funds were for areas 'blighted by empty 
shops and recovering from the riots to help bring entrepreneurs back to 
their communities'.

But it has emerged that more than a third of the councils were earmarked for the financial assistance, had less than the national average of vacant shops.

Rickmansworth had just two empty shops, which received £50,000 each, whereas Nottingham has 428 empty shops, so when the money was divided, each shop was worth just £233. 

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who sits on the Communities and Local Government Select Committee, criticised the way the money was allocated.

He said the Government did not 
collect data on high street vacancies and instead used vacancy rates 
including offices and other business premises in an area.

Rochdale MP Mr Danczuk said: 'This just shows the Government has no idea of what’s going on in town centres.

While High street shops continually closing down, particularly small independently-owned stores, cut-price shops are booming as cash-strapped families seek out bargains during the economic downturn, a report shows.

They dominate a league table of the top 50 independent grocery retailers.Six
of the top ten are cut-price stores and they are responsible for half 
of all turnover in the top 50, and two-thirds of all profits, according 
to the research published by The Grocer magazine.

'Nearly
40 per cent of local authorities awarded money have a less than national 
average empty shops rate. My constituency of Rochdale has 45 empty shops
in the town centre and we didn’t get a penny. Yet a neighbouring Tory 
area to (Housing Minister) Grant Shapps’ constituency with just two 
empty shops gets £100,000. It beggars belief.'

He
added: 'The Coalition has been in power for nearly two years now and 
you have to ask whether they’re serious about trying to tackle problems 
on the high street. If they haven’t even got the right data on empty 
shops then they can hardly claim to be doing everything possible to 
support town centres.'

In 
Three Rivers District Council, the main town centre in Rickmansworth has
just two empty shops, according to analysis by retail specialists the 
Local Data Company.

The review which covered 85 of the 100 areas awarded funding, found just 63 per cent of their core towns had a shop vacancy rate higher than the current national average of 14.6 per cent. 

Local
Data Company director Matthew Hopkinson said: 'This quick analysis 
shows that there is a wide variance in town centre health within these 
local authorities’ core towns.

'Whilst
the Government has published no allocation criteria, it clearly goes 
beyond assisting the weaker town centres through inclusion of 
below-average vacancy towns.

'As
such it would suggest that the grant is also targeted towards the 
important role of supporting existing established businesses on high 
streets to ensure they continue to remain as occupiers.

'Whilst
this funding from the Government is clearly an encouraging sign, it 
does leave hundreds of town centres up and down the country with little 
or no hope of how they can invest in turning around or indeed just 
managing the further decline on their high streets,' he added.

A
Communities and Local Government spokesman said: 'Business rates data 
is by far the most accurate at reflecting the number of empty business 
premises, and is provided by councils themselves - to use any other data
would be to short-change councils whose high streets face the greatest 
challenges and who were worst affected by last year’s riots.'
