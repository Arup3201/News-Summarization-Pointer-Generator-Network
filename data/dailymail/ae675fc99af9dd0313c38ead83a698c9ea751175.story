Residents of the predominantly white and wealthy southern part of Baton Rouge have launched a campaign to split from the rest of Louisiana's state capital and form their own breakaway city.

If the campaigners get their way, the new city of St. George would encompass 107,000 residents, around 25 percent of Baton Rouge’s current population.

Critics of the St. George proposal argue
 that it would create a poor, black, and urban Baton Rouge and a 
wealthy, white, and suburban St. George.

Redrawing the map: Residents of the predominantly white and wealthy southern part of Baton Rouge have launched a campaign to split from the rest of Louisiana's state capital and form their own breakaway city of St. George

Perkins Rowe is one of two exclusive malls that would fall within the proposed boundaries of St. George and therefore deny Baton Rouge of valuable sales tax dollars

Supporters of the proposal say they have
 about half of the 18,000 signatures they need to put incorporating St. 
George on the next ballot.

Significantly the proposed new city would include two major retail centers, Perkins Rowe and the Mall of Louisiana, that currently provide Baton Rouge with 40 percent of its sales tax revenue.

The split campaign emerged out of the ashes of a failed campaign to create a new school district.

When state legislature mothballed those proposals in June - claiming they couldn’t approve an independent school district that was unaffiliated with a city - organizers shifted their energies to the creation of St. George, reports Raw Story.

After Hurricane Katrina, the city of Baton Rouge accepted over 200,000 displaced New Orleans residents, the majority of whom were black and settled in the northern, urban parts of the city

The split campaign emerged out of the ashes of a failed campaign to create a new school district by the wealthy, predominantly white residents of southern Baton Rouge

According to recent study on the 
demographic impact of Hurricane Katrina, the city of Baton Rouge 
accepted over 200,000 displaced New Orleans residents, the majority of 
whom were black and settled in the northern, urban parts of the city.

Leaders of the St. George secession effort deny that this is the reason behind their plans. They claim the new city will be ‘wide open’ and downplay warnings of fiscal disaster for the rest of the city.

‘Typically, the only comments you hear are those that try to create fear,’ one of the leaders of the movement, Norman Browning said. ‘They never support it with any documentation to make those claims.’

But opponents note that city funds were used to develop the retail areas that would end up sucking in sales taxes from residents of the poorer part of the city.

Norman Browning, right, one of the leaders of the St. George movement claims there is no proof that the split will have an adverse effect on Baton Rouge, while councilwoman C. Denise Marcelle says the proposed change will affect everyone

‘If they pull away from Baton Rouge, it will affect everyone,’ City Councilwoman C. Denise Marcelle told The Morning Advocate.

‘We’ve spent millions of dollars on improvements out there and making traffic better, and now they want to be their own city?’

A study by the Baton Rouge Area Chamber found that the effects of the partition would be economically devastating for the remainder of Baton Rouge, immediately creating a $53 million budget shortfall.

The study also raised concerns as to whether the remaining portions of Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s state capital, would be able to support public services despite the loss of tax revenue.

As the tables below shows projected figures for St. George would create a town with an average income $30,000 higher than present day Baton Rouge, while the unemployment rate would be halved.

According to figures compiled by the Baton Rouge Area Chamber, the new town would have a majority white population, as opposed to Baton Rouge which has a black majority and the number of people receiving food stamps would also be more than halved.
