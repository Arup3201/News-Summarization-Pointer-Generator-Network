Al Qaeda has called for a new generation of ‘lone wolf’ terrorists to blow up easyJet and British Airways planes using bombs made in their kitchens.

The chilling call to arms in the terror group’s online magazine says the airlines should be targeted to gain headlines and ‘crush the enemy’s economy’.

Released on Christmas Eve, the edition of Inspire names BA because it is the ‘flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom’ and the largest airline by number of planes.

Chilling:  Al-Qaeda's house magazine (above) calls for high-profile airlines including British Airways, easyJet, AA, Delta and United to be targeted by bombers to 'crush the enemy's economy'. Police are investigating

Targets: The sick magazine picks out British Airways and easyJet as targets for would-be terrorists

EasyJet is considered a good target because it ‘is a low cost carrier, hence has a large number of passengers’.

Air France and US carriers American Airlines, United, Continental and Delta are also named, alongside high-profile American figures Bill Gates and former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.

The article praises Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called ‘underpants bomber’ jailed for life in the US in 2012 after he tried to bomb a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The 300 passengers were saved partly because the bomb sewn into his underwear failed to detonate fully, prosecutors said at the time.

The latest edition of the magazine contains supposed instructions for would-be suicide bombers who want to bypass airport security.

It has been published four years after the first issue of Inspire contained a notorious explosives guide entitled Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.

It was suspected to have been the template for explosives which killed three and injured more than 250 in last year’s Boston marathon bombings.

American Airlines, United, Continental and Delta are also named in the magazine - despite the fact that Continental Airlines stopped flying planes under its name two years ago after merging with United 

Journal: The magazine has been connected to the Boston Marathon bombings in April last year

Its author, known only as the ‘Al Qaeda chef’, was re-interviewed this week as the magazine claimed the attacks were a ‘natural reaction’ to the ‘arrogance’ of the US.

He said the ‘first priority’ for any of his terrorists would be the US, ‘then the United Kingdom, then France and so on’.

And he called for the rise of the ‘lone wolf’ jihadist, saying: ‘It is hard to uncover, because none knows him but Allah. He has no relationship with any group or any individuals.’ The magazine also praised an axe attack on a group of policemen in New York in October as a ‘splendid’ example of a ‘lone wolf’.

US navy veteran Zale Thompson was shot dead in the street after the brutal hatchet attack, which the FBI confirmed last month it was considering as an act of terror.

FBI director James Comey said Thompson had been watching Islamic State beheading videos and other radical jihadist material online, adding there is ‘no doubt that played a role’ in the attack.

Shock tactics: The magazine includes images of an airport departures board and, on its cover, a jumbo jet

Inspire is published by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based primarily in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Its possession has led to arrests of potential terrorists in Britain.

Four men were jailed for a combined 44 years in April 2013 after a court heard they had planned to follow instructions in the magazine to carry out an attack in Luton using a toy car. Other terrorists were convicted under section 58 of the 2000 Terror Act solely for possessing the magazine. Those who are found guilty can be jailed for up to ten years.

A British Airways spokesman said: ‘The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority.

‘We continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world.’

He added: ‘We never comment on matters of security.’

An easyJet spokesman said: ‘The safety and security of our passengers and crew is always our highest priority. We are unable to comment further on matters of security.’

Growing fears of a plot to launch a ‘lone wolf’ terror attack have led to royal guards being moved behind metal gates at palaces.

For the first time since the height of IRA terrorism, most of the soldiers of the Queen’s Guard are no longer allowed on sentry duty alone.

The move comes after Islamic terrorists called on their followers to target British police officers and those on ceremonial duties.

At Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles, guardsmen have been relocated behind metal gates on The Mall.

At St James’s Palace, the London home of Princesses Anne, Beatrice and Eugenie, two sentry boxes have been moved into a courtyard which cannot be seen from the public gate.

In Horse Guards Parade, two guards have been joined by four police officers carrying Heckler and Koch carbine rifles, pistols and Tasers. And up to three armed officers now stand next to the lone sentry on the western side of Windsor Castle.

The Metropolitan Police and Buckingham Palace said they do not comment on security matters. The Ministry of Defence said: ‘We routinely review security arrangements.’
