Sir Dave Brailsford, the coach behind Britain's Olympic cycling glories, has urged Scotland to vote No in the referendum 'for the sake of UK sport'.

Brailsford led Team GB to eight gold medals at both the Beijing and London Olympics, including wins for Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and is widely credited with transforming the popularity of the sport.

The former British cycling performance director said sharing talent and resources allowed the UK to achieve more in the medals tables.

Brailsford, head of the Team Sky cycling team said: 'Scotland has been a huge part of the success of British Cycling, and I hope the UK stays together for the benefit of all sport, but especially Olympic sports like ours.

'UK sport is one of the best things this country has and it is all possible because we can share talent, resources and ideas.

'I was born in England but raised in Wales with Welsh as my first language, and I feel passionately Welsh, English and British, and I feel all the countries of the UK are a big part of my national identity.

'My message to friends in Scotland is simple: "It is for you to decide your own future but for the sake of UK sport I hope you vote No".'
