Ryanair told a pensioner to abandon his wife while she was recovering from a heart attack and go on holiday with someone else, it is claimed.

Former-Lord Mayor of Liverpool Roger Johnston, 74, planned to fly to France next month with his wife Marie, 73.

They had booked seats with Ryanir when ex-nurse Marie suffered a heart attack that required surgery, leaving her unable to travel for three months.

'Insulted': Roger Johnston shows off the doctor's sick note confirming his wife had suffered a heart attack. He claims Ryanair told him to go on holiday with someone else instead

But when ex-Lib Dem councillor Roger contacted Ryanair to request a refund he says he was told to change the name on his wife’s ticket and take the flight with 'someone else'.

Retired architect Roger, of Woolton, Liverpool, is demanding a refund of the £146-a-head cost of the tickets for both flights from East Midlands Airport to Dinard, France.

But he claims that when he explained he was not ill - only his wife - the Ryanair operator suggested he should travel without her.

Roger said: 'I was absolutely appalled that they would even insinuate that I should abandon my wife at a time when she needs me the most. It’s morally insulting.

'I want a personal apology from Michael O’Leary. It’s just disgraceful that I would be treated like that when my wife was lying ill in hospital.

'I would never consider leaving my wife in such a situation. We’ve been married to for 40 years and she needs me to help look after her.

Rules: Ryanair clauses state that refunds can be issued if a doctor's note is provided confirming the illness, but that the letter must be faxed over to them

'To make matters worse Ryanir say they can only accept her doctor’s note by fax.

'I believe that this is just obstructive and designed to put people off.

'They do everything else online or by email and they should accept a doctor’s note by email too.'

There is a clause in the airline’s Conditions of Travel offering customers a refund in the event that illness prevents them from travelling.

It states that a doctor's note must be required to prove that the passenger is unwell.

Roger added: 'I asked the woman at Ryanair ''Would you go off on holiday when your husband had suffered a heart attack and had been told he cannot travel?''

'There was a deafening silence before she told me to fax over with a doctor’s note.'

Ryanair said they had listened to a recording of the call and they said he asked is the seats could be used by someone else, at which point the operator told him they could be.

They said they offered Mr Johnston a full refund on the condition that they received a doctor's note confirming his wife was sick.

Ryanair’s Stephen McNamara told Mail Online: 'Ryanair confirmed to Mr Johnston that a full refund would issue on receipt of a medical letter from his wife’s doctor. 

'The passenger called back to advise of a delay in obtaining the required letter (as the doctor was going on holiday) and it was confirmed to him that a refund would issue even if the required medical letter was received after the date of flight.

'Ryanair made all of the passenger’s options clear to him and at all times clearly advised him that a refund would issue.

'At no point did Ryanair suggest he travel without his wife and Ryanair wishes Mrs Johnston a speedy recovery and hopes to welcome the couple onto another Ryanair flight in the near future.'
