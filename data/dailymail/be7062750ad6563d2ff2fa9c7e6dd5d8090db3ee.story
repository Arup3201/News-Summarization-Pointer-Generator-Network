A businessman who three years ago was estimated to be worth nearly £40 million has been given a suspended jail sentence after a judge concluded that he had failed to obey a High Court order to pay maintenance to his ex-wife.

Michael Prest’s ex-wife Yasmin had complained that he was in contempt of court and had asked a judge to commit him to prison.

Mr Justice Moylan, who on Monday heard evidence at a High Court hearing in London during the latest stage of a long-running divorce cash fight which has been analysed by the Supreme Court, today imposed a four week suspended jail term.

Yasmin Prest, 51, pictured left, has told the High Court Family Division in London that her ex-husband Michael, pictured right, has failed to pay her the £17.5m lump sum which she won in their high profile divorce battle

Jeremy Posnansky QC yesterday told High Court Family Division judge Mr Justice Moylan that Ms Prest did not want to send her husband to prison - but that she had no alternative in view of what he had done.

Mr Posnansky said Mr Prest had falsely claimed 
he was 'impoverished' in order to avoid paying the money.

But he said the multi-millionaire had in fact been enjoying lavish holidays to the Caribbean, New York 
and France.

He had also spent around £12,000 on VIP tickets to a concert
 by pop star Justin Bieber for his children and their friends.

The court also heard that Mr Prest, who had just returned from Ibiza, was not in court because he was on a three-week holiday in New York with the children.

Mr Posnansky said that, although Mr Prest had paid the children’s school fees and 
staff costs at Ms Prest’s London home, he had not handed money to his 
ex-wife as ordered.

He said Mr Prest's 'false claims of
 impoverishment' and 'tale of woe' were 'untrue' and that there had been 'widespread and persistent' attempts to mislead the court.

In 2011, at an earlier stage of the divorce battle, Mr Justice Moylan ruled that Mr Prest's net assets were worth £37.5m.

The couple, who divorced in 2011 after an 18-year marriage, spent most of their time in London, where they shared this property in Maida Vale, but also had properties in Nigeria and the Caribbean

He ordered Mr Prest to make a lump sum 
payment of £17.5m, as well as annual payments of £300,000, to his 
wife and their four children.

The decision was later overturned at the Court of Appeal but was successfully appealed by Ms Prest at the Supreme Court - the highest court in the UK - in June last year.

Mr Prest, who is said to be in his 50s, was not at the hearing but was represented by his lawyer, Sarah Dines.

Ms Dines told the judge that a doctor had assessed Mr Prest as being unable to attend the hearing, 'both emotionally and physically' due to ill health.

But the judge rejected his bid to adjourn the case for one year on the grounds of ill health, saying he was clearly not too ill to fly to New York.

Ms Dines said Mr Prest had described his oil trading days as being 'over' and that his accounts had been closed and staff made redundant.

She also read a letter from Mr Prest to the court, in which he said he had 'never run away from anything'.

He added that he had 'engaged in the process', had not 'shirked responsibilities' and had taken care of his children.

The letter read said: 'I have not killed anyone, nor have I committed any crime. I have simply slipped on the accident of life.

'I have taken care of my children and will always do so. Any suggestion that I am running away is unfortunate.'

The couple - who married in 1993 and divorced in 2011 - spent most of their married life in London but also had properties in Nigeria and the Caribbean, the court heard.

Both Mr and Ms Prest have dual British and 
Nigerian citizenship and lived to a 'very high standard', the court was told.

'I have not killed anyone, nor have I committed any crime. I have simply slipped on the accident of life'

Michael Prest

Ms Prest still lives in the £5m 
family home in Maida Vale, west London, which she 
kept under the divorce settlement.

Three years ago, at the first stage of the couple's divorce battle, Mr Justice Moylan concluded that Mr Prest had made 'various attempts' to conceal the extent of assets.

The judge then made a wealth assessment 'doing the best he could' on the material available.

Properties which were held in the name of companies controlled by Mr Prest were a central issue in the court case.

Mr Justice Moylan initially ordered Mr Prest to transfer properties held in the names of companies he controlled to his ex-wife.

But the Court of Appeal disagreed and said Mr Prest did not have to hand property to Ms Prest. In June 2013, the Supreme Court overturned the decision and ruled in Ms Prest’s favour.

That court ruled that houses owned
 by Petrodel Resources Ltd and other Isle of Man-registered companies 
controlled by her husband in London and the West Indies can be sold to 
settle her award of £17.5m. 

The
 seven judges unanimously overturned an Appeal Court ruling that 
companies owned by the oil trader were not family assets and
 could not be taken into account when calculating a divorce payout.

The judge will give his ruling on the latest court hearing later today.
