Last year Mattel came under fire for its outdated representation of Mexican culture with its launch of Mexico Barbie who wore bright pink traditional dress and had a Chihuahua tucked under her arm.

However this doesn't appear to have deterred the toy giant who has now launched their latest doll in traditional mariachi dress complete with wide brimmed sombrero and embellished suit.

According to the General Manager of Mattel Mexico, Ana Paula Martinez de Alba.The launch of the Mexican Barbie comes a month prior to the celebration of the national day of Mexico (15 September).

Barbie takes on a full transformation wearing
 a fitted black bolero jacket and cropped trousers trimmed in intricate 
golden brocade that mirrors the pattern on her impressive, wide-brimmed 
sombrero. Flourishes include a brilliant pink tie, low ponytail and tall
 black boots.

However, Mattel's latest offering comes as a bit of a risk as Barbie's previous venture into Mexican culture caused huge controversy.

Last April, the toy company sparked controversy with the launch of its first Mexico Barbie criticised for adhering to outdated and offensive stereotypes.

Outdated or educational? Could Mattel's latest Mexican Barbie cause as much controversy as their previous offering?

Mexico Barbie wore a bright pink 'traditional' dress and held a Chihuahua, sparking a debate over whether the dolls are helpful or harmful to cultural awareness in children.

She was part of Mattel's Barbie Dolls of the World collection. Initially introduced in 1980, the line 
was relaunched in 2012 as Mattel's attempt to appeal to a new generation
 of diverse Barbie fans.

Sara Rosales, a spokesman for Mattel, told Fox News Latino
 that the toys - which represent countries including Mexico, China, 
India and Holland - are educational tools for young children.

'Girls
 enjoy exploring the world and learning about different cultures through
 play,' she explained, adding: 'The Barbie brand understands the 
significance of introducing new cultures to girls in a relatable way.'

Under fire: The Barbie Dolls of the World collection - and, in 
particular, the Chihuahua-toting Mexico Barbie (left) - was 
criticised for promoting cultural stereotypes. China Barbie (right) 
comes with a baby panda

Nonetheless, the multicultural dolls have incited criticism for their apparently simplistic portrayals of different heritages.

Felix Sanchez, chairman of the 
National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, said of the toys: 'These 
images seem very dated and seem to have been created for a different 
time.'

Indeed, most of the dolls are marketed on the Mattel website as sporting 'traditional' costumes and 'classic' looks.

Despite their latest Barbie being 
described as wearing 'traditional costume' it appears that the doll may 
not be entirely authentic.

On
 the Barbie Collector website under Doll Details the doll's skin tone is
 listed as LA tan - not exactly a perfect likeness to an actual Mexican 
woman.

Mr Sanchez added that Mattel could improve the collection by adding more contemporary representations of the countries.

All of the Dolls of the World are 
dressed in their 'native fashions', according to Ms Rosales, and they 
each carry a passport and a pet that is meant to represent their heritage.

Critics of the dolls have said that they represent cliched perceptions of different cultures.

Website The Corvallis Advocate
 said of the collection: 'Apparently no one from Mattel has ever set 
foot outside the U.S. - possibly not outside of Disneyland’s rather aged 
It’s a Small World exhibit.'

And a blogger for The Stir expressed her disapproval of Mexico Barbie: 'If you really have to do the old-fashioned, traditional dress, why not at least make it accurate?' she wrote.

Furry friends: The dolls each carry a pet that is meant to represent their respective countries. Australia Barbie for instance (middle) cradles a koala bear in her arm, and Holland Barbie (right) is accompanied by a bunny

With Mattel's latest offering based, 
once again on traditional Mexican dress, the Barbie brand could once 
again come under fire for its stereotypical approach to world cultures.

However, Mattel defends the Barbies as representations of genuine and unique qualities of countries around the globe.

'The Dolls of the World collection features the native fashions, while celebrating the cultures and diversity represented within each country in a way that will appeal to Barbie fans of all ages,' asserted Ms Rosales.
