Do you remember what life was like before you iPhone? Well Apple may be working on a device just as revolutionary after recently acquiring 3-D company PrimeSense.

It was announced today that Apple snapped up the Israeli company for around $350million dollars.

A representative for PrimseSense confirmed the deal, but so far Apple has been mum on their plans for the acquisition.

Movement: Apple confirmed Monday the purchase of Israeli company PrimeSense, which has been an innovator in motion-sensor technology

'Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,' an Apple spokesman said.

PrimeSense is perhaps best known for setting the ground work for the motion sensors in Microsoft's Kinect gaming device.

The acquisition wasn't exactly a secret. The two companies have been meeting for months, leading to reports that an acquisition was on the way. But the two still kept the deal under wraps until the big reveal.

PrimeSense's CEO Inon Beracha even went to far as to officially deny the acquisition earlier this month, calling it a 'recycled rumor'.

While Apple hasn't announced what they'll be using motion-sensor technology for, industry insiders have already begin throwing around ideas - including a rumored Apple manufactured television,

'Apple could be thinking a number of things, from gaming on iPads to a way to interact with Apple TV or the rumored TV set,' Carolina Milanesi, a tech analyst with Gartner Research told CNN.

But some say that the motion sensor technology may be a component Apple is investigating for its mapping service or cellphones.

It's best not to get too excited though, as Apple has a track record of buying smaller companies and not integrating their technology into products.

The acquisition had a positive effect for Apple shares Monday, which went up 0.8 per cent to $523.75.Â
