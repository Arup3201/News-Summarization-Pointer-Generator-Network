It may seem a bit potty - but this beautifully carved giant teapot is actually someone's dining room.

The astonishing structure forms part of a tree house lived in and designed by elderly Chinese hermit Gu Yuezi, of Chen Village, Guangdong province.   

The 64-year-old root carving artist has decided to become a recluse and live in the jungle near the city of Foshan, in the south of the country.

Going green: The 64-year-old root carving artist decided to become a recluse in 2006 after tiring of the hustle and bustle of city life

He came up with the crazy idea after tiring of the hustle and bustle of city life and the former landscape designer has retired from all commercial-related activities.

His wacky establishment consists of a giant tea pot, a bird nest and a root statue - all erected by himself.

The whole structure is around ten square metres in diameter, underpinned by six trees and is equipped with a hall, a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen.

And with the floor made of bamboo, the quirky home can bear the weight of up to 20 people.

Mr Yuezi says the tea pot is used as a dining hall where he can entertain guests - while the bird nest is his dedicated studio for painting, calligraphy and carving.

Inspiration: Mr Yuezi came up with the crazy idea as a way of concentrating on his study of art and showing indifference to wealth and status
