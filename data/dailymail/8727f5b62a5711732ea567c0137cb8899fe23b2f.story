Andrew Young told a court yesterday how John Edwards described his life with cancer-stricken wife Elizabeth as a 'living hell' and how she confiscated his car keys and cell phone after she found out about the affair with mistress Rielle Hunter.

The prosecution finally had the opportunity to cross examine the defense's star witness on his third day on the stand, where they branded him a liar and exaggerator who was using Edwards to make money and use him as his 'ticket to the top'.

They highlighted discrepancies in his book, subsequent TV interviews and before a grand jury and tried to portray the former aide as bitter against Edwards, asking him: 'You really hate him don't you?'

During the grilling by attorney Abbe Lowell, Young admitted he called Elizabeth Edwards Ursula - after the evil sea witch from Disney's The Little Mermaid.

The defense's cross examination of Andrew Young started yesterday

The defense team also highlighted inconsistencies and mistakes he had made in the book The Politician: An Insider's Account of John Edwards' Pursuit of the Presidency and the Scandal That Brought Him Down, according to ABC.

Lowell asked him: 'Isn't it true that in each and every case you've lied? Isn't it fair you viewed Mr Edwards as 
your ticket to the top and your only chance at prestige?'

Young admitted he 'believed working for a 
future president could lead to great things'.

Using his earlier testimony, in which he admitted to discrepancies in his book because of lack of time and research, Lowell asked him if he corrected the paperback version which came out six months later and he said no.

He also showed the jury the proposal for the tell-all book, in which he wrote that 'every word was provably true'.

The intense cross examination will continue today as Edwards' defense team persist in going after Young's credibility as a witness.

His wife Cheri, in the courtroom for the first time yesterday, will be the next witness to be called.

When the former presidential candidate left the Greensboro court room yesterday, he told waiting reporters, 'Oh the sun is out in more ways than one,' obviously happy with how proceedings ended for the third day of the trial.

Young also described yesterday how rapidly the relationship between the once-close friends crumbled around the same time Rielle Hunter gave birth to baby Frances Quinn.

He admitted he had a sort of 'bromance' with the-then presidential candidate and that he loved him.

When Lowell asked him: 'You fell in love with John Edwards?' he answered, 'We all did. A lot of people in the country did.'

Edwards' team went on to accuse his 
once-devoted aide of wanting to be like Edwards, even getting the same 
renovations in his house, and revealing the rest of the staff called him 
'the rose petal' and that his scathing nickname for Elizabeth was due to
jealousy.

They painted him as a man who had his heart broken and became hell bent on getting revenge.

'He said he loved me and that he knew that I knew that he would never abandon me,' Young testified earlier yesterday.

Lowell then asked him: 'You fell out of love with him?' to which he replied, 'I did, yes.'

When asked if he hated him he said he had 'mixed feelings'.

He also said the men became increasingly paranoid they were being followed and their phones tapped and began to turn on each other.

The last time they spoke was on a 
secluded road in Chapel Hill in August 2008 when Young threatened to go 
public with the affair. He told the court Edwards reply to this was, 
'You can't hurt me Andrew, you can't hurt me.'

Young has been involved in the saga 
from the beginning, as he initially tried to cover up Edwards' 
involvement with Hunter by claiming paternity of the former senator's 
love child because Edwards hoped to be named as vice-president to 
then-presidential candidate Barack Obama.

That meant the child's paternity 
needed to remain a secret but Edwards promised Young he would come 
forward once he dropped out of the 2008 race.

Fearing their phones were tapped, 
they began meeting in hotels and isolated roads and start driving 
evasively to avoid anyone who might be following them. They were aware
the National Enquirer - who broke the story about the affair - were hot
on their tail.

He told the court: 'I felt like I was
being taped, recorded, he was acting very oddly,' adding that both men 
had broken out into a sweat.

The once-loyal aide testified that he
had, by this stage, grown sick of the cover up and urged Edwards to 
confess to the affair, otherwise he himself would make it public.

'He looked at me and said, you can’t hurt me Andrew, you can’t hurt me,' before running away from the car, Young testified.

Because Edwards was close to being 
named then presidential candidate Obama's vice president, the most 
important job was to cover up the affair no matter what.

Young, on the witness stand for the third day in the former presidential candidate's
criminal trial, said the former North Carolina senator stopped 
returning his calls in January 2008, as Edwards was ending his White 
House bid.

The next month, Edwards' child, Frances Quinn Hunter, was born to his mistress Reille Hunter. The girl, now four, lives with her mother in Charlotte.

Young, who initially claimed to be the father, testified that he had grown tired of living with Hunter and wondered why Edwards hadn't claimed paternity after the girl was born, as he had promised.

He is a key witness in Edwards' criminal trial. The former senator is accused of conspiring to use secret payments from two wealthy donors to hide Hunter during his White House run. Edwards has pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign finance violations.

Edwards has denied knowing about the money and his attorneys claim that Andrew Young and his wife, Cheri, siphoned off the bulk of it to pay for the construction of their $1.5 million house near Chapel Hill.

Edwards' attorneys will get a chance to cross examine Young later on Wednesday, a day after Young said the candidate once called his mistress a 'crazy slut' who others wouldn't believe was having an affair with him.

Young testified that he flew to Texas with his wife to meet with one of the wealthy donors, Fred Baron, with four demands. 

He wanted to know why Edwards hadn't claimed paternity, he wanted a face-to-face meeting with him, he wanted to know what his long-term plans were and he wanted to stop living with Hunter.

Baron arranged for Hunter to move out of a Santa Barbara, California, house she was sharing with the Youngs, and he set up the face-to-face meeting.

But before that could happen, Edwards did eventually call Young and leave a voicemail. It was played in court: 'I miss talking to you Andrew. We'll see you pal.'

At the meeting in a hotel room near Washington on June 18, 2008, Edwards had just given a speech for then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, and he was telling people that Obama would pick him for vice president, Young testified.

Edwards and Young talked.

'He said he loved me and that he knew that I knew he would never abandon me,' Young testified.

At one point, Young overheard Edwards talking to interior designer Bryan Huffman who prosecutors say was involved in funneling money to hide Hunter.

'You're a great American. The four of us are going to do great things for the country,' Young said quoting Edwards, who was apparently referring to himself, Huffman, Baron and Young.

The meeting grew intense, and Edwards and Young started yelling at each other before Young left.

Edwards is accused of directing Young to start giving money to Hunter in May 2007, after she threatened to go to the media and expose the affair.

Edwards suggested asking elderly heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, who had already given generously to the campaign.

Prosecutors showed the jury checks from Mellon written to her interior designer, who would then endorse them and send them to Andrew and his wife, Cheri.

Starting in June 2007, Mellon would eventually provide checks totaling $750,000.

Without telling Mellon what the money would be used for beyond that it was a 'non-campaign' expense, Young said she offered to provide $1.2 million over time to help pay for the candidate's personal needs.

Under federal law, donors are limited to giving a maximum of $2,300 per election cycle.

This was Young's third day to take the stand.

Yesterday he revealed that Edwards launched a verbal attack on Rielle Hunter when he found out she was pregnant, calling her a 'crazy slut'.

Young told the court Edwards was 'very angry and concerned' when he found out about the baby in 2007 and said there was only a one-in-three chance the baby was his.

He also told the court about the intricate system of check writing used to hide funds given to Edwards my millionaire Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, which he said 'felt and smelled wrong' even though he was assured it was all legal.
