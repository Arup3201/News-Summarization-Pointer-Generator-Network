The Crown Princess of Norway’s stepbrother was killed by the crazed gunman as he shielded his ten-year-old son.

Off-duty policeman Trond Berntsen confronted Anders Breivik as the mass killer stepped on to Utoya island.

Mr Berntsen is believed to have saved his son by pushing him into bushes before he challenged the gunman.

The boy, who has not been named, 
survived and has begun telling police about the ordeal. Officers 
described his account as ‘harrowing’.

Mr Berntsen, 51, was the stepbrother 
of Crown Princess Mette-Marit. He was part of a private security 
operation for the youth summer camp at Utoya, but was unarmed.

He went to the ferry jetty following 
reports that a man, dressed as a policeman, had been acting suspiciously
 on the boat on his way to the holiday island.

A woman on the ferry, Monica Bosei, 
raised the alarm after learning details about the earlier bombing in 
Oslo.

Killer: Anders Behring Breivik

The 45-year-old museum worker asked Breivik about the attack and 
became suspicious about his answers.

As the ferry docked on Utoya she ran off the boat and called for help from Mr Berntsen, who confronted Breivik.

The right-wing fanatic drew a gun and
 shot both Mrs Bosei and the off-duty policeman. Union representative 
Harald Olsen said Mr Berntsen would not have hesitated to challenge 
Breivik, even if he knew he was armed.

‘He would not have been afraid to confront someone acting suspiciously even if they had a gun.’

Mr Berntsen’s death was confirmed yesterday by a spokesman for the Norwegian royal family.

A palace spokesman said: ‘The crown 
princess’s thoughts go to his closest family.’ Mr Berntsen’s father Rolf
 became Mette-Marit’s stepfather in 1994 when he married her divorced 
mother Marit Tjessem.

Mette-Marit, a commoner by birth, 
went on to meet Norway’s Crown Prince Haakon at a rock festival held in 
her hometown Kristiansand a few years later. The couple’s 2001 marriage 
was controversial as Mette-Marit was a single mother whose son Marius 
was born in 1997.

But her ten-year union to Prince 
Haakon has proved popular and the couple have two children, Princess 
Ingrid, seven, and five-year-old Prince Sverre.

On Sunday, Norway’s royal family 
attended a special church service for the victims of the massacre and 
lit candles in their memory. A huge sea of flowers and remembrance 
candles has been left in front of Oslo Cathedral in tribute to the dead.

Blonde 37-year-old Mette-Marit broke down in tears as she joined survivors and victims’ families at the service.

Thousands gathered in the centre of 
Oslo at noon yesterday to attend an impeccably observed minute’s silence
 for those who lost their lives.

And Prince Haakon addressed a rally in Oslo last night to show support for the victims.

He told the 150,000-strong crowd: 
‘Tonight the streets are filled with love.’ Norwegians carried white and
 red roses as they gathered in the capital and other rallies were held 
across the country.

Police now believe 68 died in the Utoya massacre, and said the majority were teenagers taking part in a Labour Party youth camp.

A further eight people are thought to
 have died in the bombing outside the government’s headquarters in Oslo,
 bringing the overall toll to 76.

Police initially thought 93 were 
killed in the attacks. A full list of the dead and missing has not been 
made public, and a team of almost 40 police officers is working to 
identify the remains of those killed.

But prime minister Jens Stoltenberg 
paid tribute to 21-year-old local councillor and political youth leader 
Tore Eikeland, whom he called ‘one of our most talented youth 
politicians’. A missing activist, 18-year-old Tarald Mjelde, was 
described by a friend as ‘the little boy with an enthusiasm that infects
 everyone around you’.

One of the youngest feared to have 
been killed was named as Johannes Buo, a 14-year-old from southern 
Norway. On a Facebook tribute page, a friend wrote: ‘It is unreal what 
has happened. You are an incredibly strong person… We all hope 
desperately to get you home safe and sound.’

Hanne Kristine Fridtun, 20, has not 
been heard from since 6pm on Friday, when she attempted to hide in the 
water around Utoya with other youngsters.

On a mobile phone, she told state 
broadcaster NRK: ‘We are 20 people hiding at the water’s edge. We are 
talking quietly so we are not heard.’

Other missing youngsters included 
Jamil Rafal Yasin, 20; Simon Saeboe, 19; Torjus Blattmann, 17; Syvert 
Knudsen, 17, and 16-year-old Marianne Sandvik.

Meanwhile, the estranged parents of Anders Behring Breivik are under armed guard in France after confessing 'we haven't slept a wink since his arrest'.

Jens Breivik, 76, and his second wife, Wanda, 71, had been expected to travel to Norway from their home in south-west France, but have instead stayed put.

'We are not leaving at present,' said Mrs Breivik. 'Jens left for Spain on Sunday morning to get away from the media pressure.'

Despite being Anders's step-mother, Mrs Breivik has never met him, while Mr Breivik has not spoken to him in 16 years.

'We've spent terrible nights, not sleeping a wink since his arrest,' said a tearful Mrs Breivik, who was speaking by the high fence surrounding their villa in the village of Cournanel, in the foothill of the Pyrenees, near Carcassonne.

'I've not met Anders but I'm still traumatised. We both are,' said Mrs Breivik, who confirmed that her husband had now returned home.

Armed police have been guarding the single-storey building, which has extensive grounds and a swimming pool.
