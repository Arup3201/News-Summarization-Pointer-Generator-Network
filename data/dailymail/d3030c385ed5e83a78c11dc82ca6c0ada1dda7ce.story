A social media consultant who claimed she was attacked for wearing Google Glass in a San Francisco bar last month has released new footage of the alleged attack.

Sarah Slocum gained internet notoriety after sharing video captured by her high-tech glasses of a group of patrons verbally abusing her and trying to take her glasses at punk rock bar Molotov's on February 22.

The 34-year-old claimed the patrons began to insult her and shout obscenities out of the blue, simply because she was wearing the head-mounted computer and camera.

However, new footage Slocum posted to her YouTube channel on the weekend shows Slocum may added fuel to the attack by cursing at a woman, sticking up her middle finger and loudly saying, 'I want to get this white trash on tape for as long as I can.'

It is at that point that a young man, clearly tired of the altercation, tried to rip the Google Glass off Slocum's head, telling her to, 'Get out of here!'

Antagonistic: During the altercation, Slocum stuck her middle finger up at a woman who she says abused her

Over it: When Sarah Slocum says, 'I want to get this white trash on tape for as long as I can', this young man reaches for her Google Glass and tells her to, 'Get out of here'

Slocum told SFGate she only started filming and name-calling after being insulted.

'They instigated the fight,' she said. 'I'm only going to put up with so much abuse.'

She said she posted the new video because she wanted to be transparent.

At the time of the incident, Slocum claimed she was simply showing friends how to use the new technology when she was attacked.

However, witness Brian Lester, told CBS San Francisco that Slocum was being irritating, filming people on the device without their consent.

'The crowd was jeering as any last call crowd would do with a fight outside of a bar,' Lester said.

'She was running around very excited ... and people were telling her, 'you're being an ***, take those glasses off'.

'I
 think everybody was just upset that she would be recording outside of a
 bar this late with obvious embarrassing behavior going on. And just 
rather insulted that someone thinks it's okay to record them the entire 
time they're in public.'

Opportunistic: After the February 22 dispute at Molotov's bar, Sarah Slocum (pictured) was quick to parlay the skirmish into appearances on CNN and 'Inside Edition'

The
 altercation came just a week after Google released a list of dos and 
don'ts for Glass users including 'don't be creepy or rude (aka, a 
'Glasshole').'

Following the infamous bar feud, Slocum became an unofficial ambassador of Google Glass.

While some in the tech community have applauded her unapologetic embrace of the new technology, others have accused her - and people like her - of being a 'Glasshole'.

Even the woman filmed at Molotov's appears to have jumped on the anti-tech bandwagon, caught on camera telling Slocum, 'You're killing the city', a reference to a larger backlash against tech workers in San Francisco.

Slocum's infamous bar feud has raised questions internationally about privacy and its limits.

Now, with so much scrutiny, embarrassing 
events from Slocum's past have begun to surface, including various 
restraining orders filed against her.

CBS San Francisco recently reported that Slocum was served a restraining order in August 2012 after admitting to secretly recording her neighborsâ€™ conversation through an open window in Santa Cruz, California.

Jessie Lilley Campbell told the media outlet she made her scuffle with Slocum public 'because I wanted people to know that Sarah Slocum is no victim'.

Campbell
 said she and her husband David Campbell have since relocated to another
 part of Santa Cruz, even though the restraining order against Slocum is
 still in effect, just to 'get away from her'.

Slocum, however, has maintained
 the recording she made was from a place that was legal and she did it 
because her 'hippy biker neighbors' were talking about her.

Slocum was living on a cabin on the same property as the Campbells, Baltimore Sun reported.

'It was a spat with 
neighbors. That lady also recorded her husband (with her 
cellphone) chasing a friend of mine with an axe,' Slocum said.

'I walked by their place on the way to my cabin, their window was open 
and I could hear them from the driveway. I heard them talking about me 
and conspiring against me so I started recording to capture what they 
were saying so that I could show it to my friends and family.'

Former neighbors

Court action: Slocum's former neighbors, Jessie Lilley and David Campbell, took a restraining order out against Slocum in 2012 which is still in effect

Meanwhile, SFWeekly has reported that court records from San Mateo County showed a restraining order was granted against Slocum in 2011 following accusations of domestic violence made by her mother, Maya Slocum.

'My mom and I have gotten into a few physical disputes,' Slocum said. 'That's between us. We're on good terms now.'
