Una Foden of The Saturdays revealed an unlikely allegiance when she was seen in a Sunderland shirt at a concert.

The Irish singer is more likely to be spotted watching rugby than football due to her marriage to Northampton Saints and England full-back Ben Foden.

But she was at Sunderland's Stadium of Light stadium for the Blinkbox Music UK Live concert which also featured Jessie J, Jason Derulo, Rizzle Kicks and Katy B on the line-up.
