A mother-of-four has told of her horror after she opened a jar of Doritos salsa dip and found a dead bug inside.

Katrina Smith was just moments away from putting the insect in her mouth as she sat down to watch television on Sunday evening.

The 33-year-old had dipped a crisp into the mild salsa dip and was about to take a bite when she spotted the creature.

Mother of four Katrina Smith opened her Doritos dip and was shocked to find this large dead insect inside

Pictures taken by Ms Smith show the black bug - which is about 3cm long and looks like a cockroach - on its back in the middle of the jar next to a crisp.

The mother-of-four originally bought the £1.14p dip in a Tesco store in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, on June 14 this year.

She took the jar back to the shop on Monday and is now waiting for Doritos to receive the product so they can conduct a full investigation.

Ms Smith says she was too disgusted to pick out the black bug - but believes it was either a cockroach or a beetle.

Ms Smith, who is eight weeks pregnant, said: 'I realised it just before I put it in my mouth. I saw something black, it had legs, arms, little horns and a face - it was absolutely disgusting.

'I took it into the kitchen to have a look at it to see what it was and realised it was some kind of creature.'

Ms Smith, who lives in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, said the incident had left her shaken made her wary of what she eats.

She said: 'It used to be my absolute favourite flavour but I’m never buying it again. It was so disgusting, it’s made me think not just about the dip but every single piece of food I eat.'

Ms Smith, who is struggling to eat during her pregnancy, says she will never buy the dip again

She added: 'It’s just the thought of having anything like that close to me again. The fact that I’m pregnant and I am struggling to eat as well doesn’t help.

'Everything that I buy, I open and look inside because I think I am going to find something.'

A spokesman for Doritos confirmed they would be launching an investigation into the find.

He said: 'The safety of our consumers is always our number one concern and we take issues like this very seriously. We are waiting to receive the product so that we can conduct a full investigation.'

A Tesco spokesman added: 'We set ourselves high standards for the quality of the food we sell and were disappointed to hear of this incident.

'We have contacted the supplier so they can investigate and our Customer Service Team will update Mrs Smith with the findings.'

The jar was bought from Tesco in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. The company say they have informed their suppliers
