From TOWIE's Mark Wright and James Argent to Harry Styles and Nick Grimshaw, some men just can't hide their close friendships, or 'bromances' as they've come to be dubbed.

But one pair of inseparable men spend an astonishing 98 per cent of their waking time together after forging a 13-year friendship.

Lee Arnold, 23, and Neil Barnard, 24, who are proud of their TOWIE-style so-called 'Bromance', work, live, and sometimes even read in bed together.

Despite their incredible closeness which also includes them wearing matching clothes, the pair, from Brighton, insist they are not gay.

Much to the annoyance of their long-suffering girlfriends, the pair are rarely out of each other's sight 12 hours a day seven days a week.

Lee even went for the same job role as Neil at a home improvement company - just so he could spend more time with his chum.

Not content with spending just the working day together Neil then moved in with Lee and his girlfriend Jade, 25, just over a month ago.

Inseparable: The inseparable pair spend an astonishing 98 per cent of their waking time together after forging a 13-year friendship but insist they are not gay

Today they were announced as 'Britain's biggest Bromance' after a two month nation-wide search of 7,000 entries.

Neil, who is currently teaching Lee the acoustic guitar, said: 'He's my best mate and I love him. Not enough blokes say that enough about their friends.

'We've been inseparable since a young age and we're always having a laugh together.

'We just like being in each other's company. I would trust him with my life.

'The other day his mum phoned me up saying do you want to come to a Ronan Keating concert, so I took his mum out for the night.

'We'd do anything for each other.

'He's going to be best man at my wedding and I will at his. As long as our girlfriends don't break up with us.'

The pals first met each other when they were just 11 years old and soon became best mates - even swapping their timetables so they could be in the same classes.

Ever since, this friendship blossomed and after Lee was left on his own while soldier Neil served in Afghanistan, the pair made a vow never to leave each other's side once he returned.

Lee added: 'We're just typical blokes. We like to go down the pub, have a laugh.

'It just happens that we have the same job and live together.

'Our girlfriends are quite understanding about it all really. Luckily we all get on, but I'm sure they would want us to spend a bit more time with them

'Last week on Valentine's Day - there was me, Lee and Jade sat around the table at dinner. They know they've got to share.'

Richard Paul, marketing executive for The Stag Company, who launched the search for 'Britain's most bromantic couple', said: 'It's time to embrace man-to-man platonic adoration.

'Sometimes men find it hard enough 
saying "I love you" to their other halves or even family members, so 
their best friends never get a look in.

'So we thought we'd find the biggest bromance and get it out there for everyone to see.'

Lee and Neil won a lavish 'Bromantic' dinner.
