One day before the guffaw-inducing October 1 launch of the Obamacare program's healthcare.gov website, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough was telling friends that 'when we turn it on tomorrow morning, we're gonna knock your socks off.'

Less than three weeks later, President Barack Obama asked McDonough whether it would ever be possible to make the website function reliably.

'Can it be patched and improved to work, or does it need to be scrapped to start over?' the top White House aide recalled the president asking him on October 17. 

Obama 'wanted to know if this thing is salvageable,' he told Time magazine.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

President Barack Obama addressed the Affordable Care Act in a Rose Garden speech on October 1, predicting a revolution in health care, but sixteen days later he knew the online project could be unsalvageable; and three days later he was back in the Rose Garden to pivot away from the website as technicians scrambled behind the scenes

Tough times: White House chief of staff Denis McDonough (L) had the unenviable task of finding out whether or not healthcare.gov was completely dead, and telling the president

Day One: Healthcare.gov spat and sputtered its way to a horrible launch, with few Americans able to visit the site

The startling conversation happened on the day the federal government came back to work following a partial shutdown that lasted 16 days. Obama took a victory lap in a brief speech, launched into bilateral talks with Italy's prime minister, and handed the hot potato to Press Secretary Jay Carney.

A frazzled Carney faced a hostile briefing room that afternoon, a gathering of dozens of reporters eager to move past the back-and-forth of shutdown politics and headlong into Obamacare.

'I think that the president’s goal is that
 there’s a process in place through the various ways that people can get
 access to the information they need to enroll,' he rambled during one sustained run-on, 'so that everybody who 
needs affordable health insurance in states across the country can look 
at the options available to them because of the Affordable Care Act, 
because of the marketplaces, because of the increased competition 
created by the marketplaces, and make choices that fit their budgets, 
that work for them because of the subsidies available for those who have
 low incomes.'

CNN senior White House correspondent Brianna Keilar asked about her network's medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, who had already gone on the air twice to demonstrate the 'fixes' that had been applied to healthcare.gov. Both times, on live television, Cohen couldn't log on.

Carney told Keilar that the president was personally engaged in fixing the problems.

'Nobody is more insistent that that work
 be done and the experience be improved than the president, as he has 
made clear,' he said, adding later that 'the people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work fixing the problems that need to be fixed, and that is the focus of the president’s attention.'

Obama brought in Jeffrey Zients to supervise the repair process, but he didn't know at the outset whether it was an impossible job

CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner has been accused of keeping the White House in the dark about just how desperate the Obamacare website situation was -- and later stonewalled Congress about early enrollment numbers covering those first hectic weeks

Wunderkind: White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park may haev saved Obama's legacy by springing into action, recruiting tech-savvy veterans of the president's political operation, and patching enough software holes to get healthcare.gov working

But that focus, it turns out, was on determining whether the repair was feasible at all. When Obama addressed the nation that morning after signing the bill that sent government employees back to work, he didn't mention health care reform at all.

But three days later the president delivered a passionate stemwinder in the Rose Garden, an event that White House sources at the time told MailOnline was hastily assembled.

As a newly recruited team of young tech gurus worked 18-hour days to learn whether the online project should be patched or scrapped, Obama de-emphasized healthcare.gov entirely – almost telegraphing a future where call centers, walk-in appointments and paper applications would become more and more important.

'We’re also redoubling our efforts to make sure you can still buy the same quality, affordable insurance plans available on the marketplace the old-fashioned way – offline, either over the phone or in person,' he said.

'And, by the way, there are a lot of people who want to take advantage of this who are more comfortable working on the phone anyway or in person.'

And in a moment that earned him mockery around the world as 'the Shamwow president,' Obama leaped into infomercial mode.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (2nd L) has been all smiles while hawking Obamacare -- except when testifying before Congress about it

All was not well: By November 7 the Obamacare website was spewing gibberish instead of communicating with medical insurance customers

'The point is, the call centers are available.' he assured his audience. 'You can talk to somebody directly and they can walk you through the application process.'

'And I guarantee you: If one thing is worth the wait, it’s the safety and security of health care that you can afford, or the amount of money that you can save by buying health insurance through the marketplaces.'

He even offered house calls of a sort.

Spear-catcher: Press secretary Jay Carney took flak from all sides on Oct. 17, 2013, the day the president asked his chief of staff whether he should scrap the Obamacare website and start it from scratch

'If you’ve already tried to apply through the website and you’ve been stuck somewhere along the way, do not worry,' the president said. 'In the coming weeks, we will contact you directly, personally.'

While the president papered over the technical failures of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, White House chief technology officer Todd Park was building a dream team to right the ship, Time notes.

But one recruited engineer looked at Obamacare's digital mess and delivered a stinging assessment: 'Maybe we had to tell the world we'll be back to you in six or nine months with a new site.'

With turnaround specialist Jeff Zients as point man in the White House, Park's group took baby steps toward making healthcare.gov a workable site.

Ten days into the project they told Ziients that they could have it shipshape by the end of November.

That intermediate deadline became a Whtie House talking point, delivered by everyone from Carney to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who was desperate for good news.

On Oct. 30, while she was preparing to testify before a congressional panel about the project's sequence of disasters, the website went down again – turning the computer engineers' punch list into yet another punchline.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment about the president's deliberations in mid-October when he learned that healthcare.gov might not be fixable.
