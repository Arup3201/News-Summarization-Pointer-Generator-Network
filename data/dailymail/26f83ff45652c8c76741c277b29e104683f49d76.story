Mitt Romney made his first step towards shaping his post-campaign career as he officially re-joined the board of directors of Marriott hotels.

The decision to re-enter the world of corporate management comes as little surprise, as Romney made his name in venture capitalism, and he has a very strong family connection to the Marriotts.

The hotel chain was started by J.W. Marriott, a fellow Mormon who was very close with Mitt's father George.

Low key: Family outings, like the one to Disneyland (left) or to get gas (right) have been common of late, but his latest decision to rejoin the Marriott board is the first career move he has made

Mitt served on the board of the company from 1993 to 2002 when he resigned to serve as governor of Massachusetts.

He rejoined the board in 2009 and resigned again in January 2011 as the campaign heated up with the seemingly-unending process of Republican primaries.

'It is an honor to once again be able to serve in the company of leaders like Bill Marriott and Arne Sorenson and to support the work of the tens of thousands of Marriott associates who make Marriott International the renowned success that it is,' Romney said in a statement released announcing the board position on Monday according to CNN.

Board members receive an annual salary of $60,000 as well as $110,000 in company stock as compensation for their efforts.

The former presidential candidate has laid low ever since he lost the election, relaxing with his family in La Jolla, California and taking time out to see the latest edition of the Twilight saga and accompanying his grandchildren to Disneyland.

Romney briefly popped back up on the 
political radar when he had lunch with President Obama in the White 
House last week, though he did not speak to reporters after the meeting 
and only one joint photo was released.

Verbally proud: J.W. Marriott Jr., of the hotel magnate family, praised Mitt and Ann Romney during church on Sunday

It comes as no surprise that the company would welcome Romney back with open arms, as billionaire J.W. Marriott Jr. praised the presidential candidate for bringing positive attention to their shared religion during a church service in September.

'There has never been as much positive attention to the church, thanks to the wonderful campaign of Mitt Romney and his family,' the 80-year-old J.W. Marriott Jr. said at a Sunday service at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in New Hampshire.

Friends in hand: Nancy Marriott handed her umbrella to Ann Romney as she walked into the service at Wolfeboro, New Hampshire

Happy to see you: Once inside, Nancy's husband J.W. Marriott Jr praised the Romneys and what their openness has done for the public perception of Mormonism

'That's a great tribute to Mitt and Ann and their family for living such an exemplary life,' he said.

'Now that we're out of obscurity, everybody is looking at us and saying, "Are you as good as the Romneys?"'

The former Massachusetts governor and hotel magnate have been close friends, as were generations of their family.

Mitt's father, George Romney, was in 
fact so close to J.W. Jr's father J. Willard Marriott that Romney named 
his son after him. Mitt is the politician's middle name, and his legal 
first name is Willard.
