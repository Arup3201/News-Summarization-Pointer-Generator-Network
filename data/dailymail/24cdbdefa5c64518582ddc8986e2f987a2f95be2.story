FIFA have fined the Algerian FA £33,000 (50,000 Swiss francs) after fans set off smoke bombs and flares in their group stage game against Russia.

The governing body announced the fine on Monday, saying the Algerian FA 'has been held liable for the improper conduct among its own group of spectators.'

Algeria fans are known for bringing fireworks into stadiums and could potentially bring more pyrotechnics to their last-16 tie with Germany.

At a World Cup warm-up against Romania in Geneva on June 4, the referee threatened to abandon the match because of Algeria fans’ disorder.

Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was also targeted with a laser pen before Algeria scored in a 1-1 draw at Curitiba last Thursday.
