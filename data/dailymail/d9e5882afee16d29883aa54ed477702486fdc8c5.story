When her beloved horse Otto died, Sharon Widdows wanted to give the 18-year-old thoroughbred the send-off he deserved.

She spared no expense in arranging a private cremation, believing that £920 was a small price to pay to have her loyal companion’s body treated with respect.

But a few weeks later, the company she had entrusted with the sensitive task handed her a container just 18 inches long and containing only a heap of ashes weighing 11lb.

casket 

Suspicions: Horse owner Sharon Widdows, 40, knew something was wrong when the ashes of her thoroughbred were returned in a tiny box, right, that was much smaller than the normal size expected for a cremated horse, pictured left

Distraught: The mother-of-two, pictured riding 
Otto on the right, from Stonehouse, near Stroud, contacted authorities 
when she realised the casket was too small for her 16.3hh (5'7") horse

Mrs Widdows immediately suspected that the remains could not be those of Otto, who had stood at a muscular 16.3 hands high (5ft 7in) and weighed around 1,000lb.

Her worst fears were finally confirmed when it emerged that the man to whom she entrusted her thoroughbred’s remains had simply dumped them in a knacker’s yard – where they were turned into fertiliser and glue.

The ashes she was given are thought to have belonged to an unidentified dog. Mrs Widdows said she was ‘sickened’ when she learned the truth. 

Following the discovery, trading standards launched an investigation into Philip Cooper, to whom she had entrusted Otto’s body. They have since found as many as 31 grieving horse lovers had been duped by Cooper, 69, who made around £500 profit on each ‘cremation’.

Instead of giving them a private burial, he dumped the horses with dozens of other animal carcasses and took them to a rendering plant, where he paid £40 to have them made into glue and fertiliser.

Duped: Cooper was contracted to cremate horses by veterinary surgery Bushy Equine Services, used by Mrs Widdows, which had no idea he was not honouring the agreement

The fees he charged varied. Some of the money he charged went to veterinary practices with whom he had contracts – and who were not aware of his methods.

The fraudster has now been ordered to pay compensation to his victims and was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence. Yesterday Mrs Widdows, a mother of two, said she was referred to Cooper after discussing her wishes with a vet after Otto died in January 2009.

After a delay in the ashes being returned to her, she had been horrified to discover that Otto had been taken to a location in Devon which does not have a crematorium, only a rendering plant.

Mrs Widdows, from Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, looked after Otto for two years after he retired as a riding horse. ‘He was a part of our family, a special horse,’ she said.  ‘I was absolutely gutted that Otto had died, but believed he would be getting the send-off I wanted.’

She continued: ‘The girl at the vets was shaking as she handed over the casket. I got it home and it was just tiny with a small amount of bone and ash inside.’

She later learned that the box she was given was four times smaller than a horse casket. Cooper, from Chilcompton, was first prosecuted in 2011 after admitting cheating five women by pretending their horses would be cremated individually.

A further 26 victims then came forward after the case was publicised. Last week he appeared at Gloucester Crown Court to admit fraud. Judith Kenney, prosecuting for Gloucestershire trading standards department, said Cooper had fraudulently obtained £14,393 from the 26 new cases.

Judge Jamie Tabor ordered Cooper to pay £1,000 compensation to each of the 26 victims.
