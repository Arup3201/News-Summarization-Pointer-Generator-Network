When it comes to working out, there could be no better partner than your brother, or even better your twin. 

Which is precisely why James and Tom Exton, from South West London, the super hot co-founders of LDN Muscle decided to go into business together.

Spurring each other on in the gym as they share a mutual love for exercise, these two could easily be contenders for the UK's hottest twins.

James said: 'Tom and I have obviously grown up together, and have a long shared a passion for keeping fit, healthy and in shape.

'From this we, alongside the Bridger Brothers [Tom and James' business partners], created LDNMuscle - to share our unbiased advice, support and knowledge, to help as many people as possible to transform.'

The LDNMuscle website provides premium health and fitness guides online. And Tom says that working together is surprisingly easy. 

Speaking to Femail he said: 'Working together is great and works surprisingly efficiently as we know each other so well there’s rarely any second guessing about the others opinions on things. 

'That said, as with all brothers, and business partners there’s always disagreements. It hasn’t ever got physical though since we were kids, it wouldn’t end well these days if it did!'

The brothers say they enjoy working together and although they disagree sometimes they never fight

But James says that the brothers still try to take some time out to enjoy themselves.

'[Keeping fit] is obviously a massive part of our lives, but neither of us let it get in the way of enjoying ourselves – be it going abroad or going out with friends,' he said.

'We are firm believers that you can be in the shape you want, whilst balancing an enjoyable sustainable lifestyle.'

And when they hit the gym together they can rely on one another for support. Tom said: 'We rarely find time to train together now, with full time work commitments in different places. 

'But we are fairly competitive when we do, and means neither of us can let ourselves slip as inevitably we are compared to the other. Nobody wants to be the worst twin!'

Tom and James share their top tips for getting bikini ready this summer... 

1. Manage Your Time

Tom says: 'Strike the balance between achieving your goals and living a healthy balanced life.'

2. Preparation

James says: 'Plan your week in advance, that's both your diet and training. With the correct preparation it really doesn't need to be intrusive or laborious.'

3. Be Realistic 

Tom says: 'Be realistic from the outset. Set goals which are achievable and not idealistic. This will keep motivation high and reduce the risk of becoming despondent and losing interest.'

4. Track Your Progress 

James says: 'Try to use photos, and don't get caught up on scale weight. The scales don't tell the full picture and in many cases lead to undue criticism, you will be amazed when you look back through your photo log.'

5: Enjoy It! 

Both the twins say: 'Ultimately enjoy your transformation & fitness journey. You’ll certainly get a lot more out of it, and are much more likely to succeed. 

Don't resort to extreme short-term measures as these can put you back to a worse position than where you came from in the long run. Healthy, maintainable and sustainable is the way forward.

Although James says he has the edge on his brother when it comes to fitness. 'I would say I am technically 'fitter' than Tom. 

'I commute by bike and rack up 100-150 miles on an average week, while he sits on varying modes of public transport for a couple of hours a day. 

'Unlike some, I actually enjoy cardio, and of course there are many associated health benefits too.'

And Tom says that unsurprisingly the pair do attract some attention from the ladies: 'I would be lying to say we didn’t get any, I can’t yet work out whether my hideous beard or James’s ridiculous haircut help or hinder though!'
