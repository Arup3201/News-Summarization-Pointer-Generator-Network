It's a time to appear at one's most modest in a bid to impress judge and jury.

But arriving for a crown court hearing, this convicted drug user looked as if she was ready for a night on the town, wearing an extremely low-cut top beneath her suit jacket.

Lisa Beatrice Hutchinson appeared at Durham Crown Court in her racy outfit alongside her disgraced solicitor ex-boyfriend for a sentencing hearing.

Appropriate? Bernard Ridsdale Tombling and Lisa 
Beatrice Hutchinson (pictured in a very low cut blazer) were found with an estimated £8,000 worth of 
amphetamines at the house they shared at the time

Bernard Ridsdale Tombling and Hutchinson were ordered to pay just £800 after being convicted of possessing £8,000 of amphetamines at the house they shared at the time, in Sedgefield, County Durham.

Police
made the discovery after being called to a report of a disturbance at 
the property in Wellgarth Mews, shortly after 7am on Sunday March 27 
last year.

Tombling, who was struck off as a 
solicitor in 2000 following a conviction for defrauding the legal aid 
board, was today ordered to perform 120 hours of unpaid work as part of a 
12-month community order imposed for the drug offence in August.

Hutchinson was ordered to carry out 80 hours unpaid work.

Following inquiries into their means, the case of both was listed for a Proceeds of Crime hearing yesterday.

Lee
Fish, prosecuting, asked for a confiscation order of £422 against each 
of them, but confirmed the money had already been paid by Tombling.

Disgraced: Tombling, 57, (pictured) now of Kirklevington, 
Yarm, and 35-year-old Hutchinson admitted possessing the class B drug, 
but denied intending to supply it at their trial at Durham Crown Court 
in July

Judge
Christopher Prince agreed to make the order in that sum. Scott Smith, 
for Hutchinson, confirmed that her element of that sum had been paid by 
Tombling.

Tombling, 57, now of Kirklevington, 
Yarm, and 35-year-old Hutchinson admitted possessing the class B drug, 
but denied intending to supply it at their trial at Durham Crown Court 
in July.

The prosecution claimed a note found 
at the house appeared to contain suggestions relating to the setting up 
of an escort agency, which failed to get off the ground.

But
Tombling said the large amount of drugs was for their own personal use 
and, following a three day trial, the pair were both cleared of 
possession with intent to supply.
