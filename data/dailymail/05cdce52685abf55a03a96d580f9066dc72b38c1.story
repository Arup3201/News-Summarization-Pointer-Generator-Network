The diaries of war poet Siegfried Sassoon, stained with mud from the bloody killing fields of the Somme, will be placed online for the first time by Cambridge University today.

His collection of 23 journals and two notebooks of poetry from its £1.25million Sassoon Archive include his account of the horrifying slaughter of the first day of the battle.

They are recorded in his compact, neat handwriting - and describe 'a sunlit picture of hell'.

A collection of 23 of Sassoon's journals along with two notebooks, which describe the horror of conflict in vivid detail, were bought by the university for £1.25million

Sassoon's notes on the conflict are often accompanied with drawings, some practical sketches of battlefield, and others distorted sketches showing his state of mind

And in one tiny black notebook he wrote his 'Soldier's Declaration', a damning criticism of the mindless slaughter of the First World War, later read out in Parliament.

Cambridge University Librarian Anne Jarvis said: 'The war diaries Sassoon kept on the Western Front and in Palestine are of the greatest significance, both nationally and internationally, and we are honoured to be able to make them available to everyone, anywhere in the world, on the 100th anniversary of the First World War.

'The Sassoon archive is a collection of towering importance, not just to historians, but to anyone seeking to understand the horror, bravery and futility of the First World War as experienced by those on the front lines and in the trenches.'

Materials bought by the university in 2009 after fundraising from Sassoon biographer Max Egremont, Sir Andrew Motion, Michael Morpurgo and Sebastian Faulks

While Sassoon's notes begin optimistically, as the war progressed his work became increasingly dark and disturbed as he became disillusioned with the conflict

The newly published work includes 23 of Sassoon's journals from the years 1915-27 and 1931-32, as well as two poetry notebooks from 1916-18 containing rough drafts and fair copies of some of his best-known war poems.

The diaries recall the moment he was shot by a sniper at the Battle of Arras and also include haunting sketches and drawings.

The materials were bought by the university in 2009 following a fundraising campaign spearheaded by Sassoon's official biographer Max Egremont, and supported by Sir Andrew Motion, Michael Morpurgo and Sebastian Faulks.

The archive can be accessed from today through the Cambridge University digital library at: cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk 

The notes are being released on the 100th anniversary of the First World War. Sassoon himself imagined what life would be like 100 years after the war (left). He also used his notes to craft his poetry, such as one entitled 'They' (right)

Sasoon's Military Cross, the ribbon of which he threw into the River Mersey

Siegfried Sassoon was born on 8 September 1886 in Kent. His father was part of a Jewish merchant family, originally from Iran and India, and his mother part of the artistic Thorneycroft family. 

Sassoon studied at Cambridge University but left without a degree. He then lived the life of a country gentleman, hunting and playing cricket while also publishing small volumes of poetry. 

Motivated by patriotism and a desire to do his duty, Siegfried Sassoon joined the British Army just as the First World War broke out in 1914, and by May the next year was on his way to fight in France with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers.

In battle he was an inspiring presence, driven to acts of almost suicidal bravery in the face of danger. During one attack on the Hindenburg Line, Sassoon single-handedly captured an enemy trench, earning him the nickname 'Mad Jack'.

On 27 July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme, he was awarded the Military Cross for helping gather dead and wounded soldiers from an enemy trench for an hour and a half despite being constantly shot at and bombed.

However, as the war wore on Sassoon became increasingly disillusioned with the conflict. During the Battle of Arras in 1917 he was hit by a sniper's bullet and had to be sent away from the trenches to recover.

Once his wounds had healed, Sassoon took the extraordinary step of refusing to return to service. He threw the ribbon of his medal into the River Mersey, and penned his Soldier's Declaration - a powerful statement against the war which was reprinted in a national newspaper and read out in Parliament on 30 July, 1917, by sympathetic MP Hastings Lees Smith.

Being both a decorated war hero and a published poet, the move caused public outcry. Only the actions of fellow poet Robert Graves stopped him from being court-martialled and he was transferred to Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh where he was officially treated for shell shock.

There he met another great war poet, Wilfred Owen. Once recovered the pair were moved back into action in 1918, where Owen was killed.

Sassoon served for a time in Europe before being moved to Palestine. On his return to France he was again wounded, and spent the rest of the war in England.

After the war Sassoon spent some time travelling the US, before writing autobiographical novel Memoirs Of A Fox-Hunting Man which was published in 1928 and became an instant success. Memoirs Of An Infantry Officer'  followed in 1930 and Sherston's Progress  was printed in 1936.

He later married Hester Gatty and the couple  had a son, George. In 1957, Sassoon was received into the Catholic church and he died on 1 September 1967.
