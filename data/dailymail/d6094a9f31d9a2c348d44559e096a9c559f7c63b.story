They say that everybody is born with a special skill - you just have to discover it.

Sara X Mills might not have found hers yet, but she has certainly unearthed a unique party trick. 

The tattooed model can move her breasts in time to music and can play out an entire piece by Mozart.  

She has ensured her achievement goes down in history by recording her boobs in action an uploading the clip to the internet. 

The soundtrack Sara chose to showcase her talent is called Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and was performed by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in 1936. 

Since she uploaded the piece earlier this week, Sara has been on the receiving end of speculation that she faked the movements. 

Sara X Mills has filmed a video of herself synchronising her chest to a Mozart symphony 

The model has revealed that her breast implants give her much greater control over her chest movements 

Viewers accused her of attaching invisible string to her chest, creating an effect similar to a puppeteer, who would move the body parts from above.  

There was also a far-fetched theory that Sara had been shocking herself electronically to force the movements.

But she has since responded to the critics on her Facebook page, revealing that her fake breasts are the tool that enabled her to move her chest so easily. 

She said: 'While my boobs are very fake, the video is very real... I am flexing my pectoral muscles and it's moving my implants.'
