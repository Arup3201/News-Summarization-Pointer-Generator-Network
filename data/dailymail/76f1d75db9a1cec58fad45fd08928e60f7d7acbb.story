Breakthrough: Scientists in have genetically engineered rice to produce high levels of human blood albumin, a protein used to treat serious injury and disease

Scientists in China believe they have found a way of harvesting large amounts of a human blood protein used to treat burns, trauma injuries and liver disease - from grains of rice.

When extracted from rice seeds, the protein is 'physically and chemically equivalent to blood-derived human serum albumin (HSA),' according to research published in the U.S. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The findings could lead to a breakthrough in production of HSA, which typically comes from human blood donations.

The demand for the blood protein is about 500 tons per year worldwide and China has faced worrying shortages in the past.

The rice method was devised by scientists at Wuhan University in China and colleagues from the National Research Council of Canada and the Center for Functional Genomics at the University at Albany in New York.

First, they genetically engineered rice seeds to produce high levels of HSA.

Then, they worked out a way to purify the protein from the seeds, gathering about 2.75grams of the protein per 1kg (2.2lbs) of rice.

When they tested the rice-made protein in rats with liver cirrhosis, a common condition for which the human equivalent is often used, they found it produced similar outcomes to treatment with HSA.

Medical marvel? It is hoped the new technique will solve shortages in the production of HSA, which typically comes from blood donations

'It looks like an interesting technological step forward,'Â  Dr Richard Benjamin, chief medical officer for the American National Red Cross, told FoxNews.com.

'It could potentially produce large quantities in a reasonable time. The disadvantage of what we currently use is that it is a blood product, which means it could transmit infection.'

But concerns have been raised that it could actually raise possibility of the transmission of hepatitis and HIV since the protein comes from human blood.

The protein is often used in the manufacture of vaccines and drugs and is given to patients with serious burn injuries, hemorrhagic shock and liver disease, the researchers said.

Concerns: There are fears the large-scale planting of genetically modified rice fields need to produce large amounts of the protein could lead to food-supply contamination

In 2007, a shortage in China led to price spikes and a brief rise in the number of fraudulent albumin medicines on the market.

But large-scale planting of genetically modified rice fields that could produce enough seed for mass production of the protein also raises environmental and food supply contamination concerns, since rice is a major world food staple.

More research is needed to evaluate the safety of the rice-derived protein in animals and humans before it can be considered for the market.
