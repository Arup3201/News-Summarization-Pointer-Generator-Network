Andros Townsend will play for the first time in Cyprus, the island where his mother's family hail from, and hope Tottenham's Europa League play-off can provide the same inspiration it did for him last year.

Townsend sparkled against Dinamo Tblisi, 12 months ago, establishing him in the Spurs squad after a series of nine loan deals and catapulting him into the England team for crucial World Cup qualifiers.

Injuries interfered with the end of the season and forced him to miss the World Cup in Brazil but he is fit for today's game against AEL Limassol in Larnaca.

Home-grown: Andros Townsend's mother is from Cyprus, where he will play tonight against AEL Limassol

'The Dinamo Tbilisi game was really the one that made me push on,' said Townsend, in an interview with the Tottenham Journal. 'This time it's special for me again because I'm half Cypriot and to go out and play in Cyprus for the first time will be quite special. Hopefully I can get the nod and have a similar impact as I did last year.'

'My mum's Cypriot and I've got family there who are hopefully going to come and watch me for the first time, so it should be a good game and a special occasion.'

Townsend was born in Leytonstone to a Jamaican father Troy and a Cypriot mother Katerina, so he could have played international football for Cyprus, but has always represented England. He was handed his full debut by Roy Hodgson against Montenegro in October last year and responded with a brilliant goal, the third in a 4-1 win.

Europa League: Townsend's performance at last year's play-off earned him a place in Spurs's starting XI

'No matter what game you're playing in, as long as you're playing in front of the first-team manager there's always opportunities to impress, whether it's a training match or a Europa League match,' said Townsend. 'I did that last year and hopefully some of the boys who are on the bench this year can do the same.'

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino plans to rest some of his senior stars. Five of those who started against West Ham on Saturday have not travelled to Cyprus, and there will be opportunities for others, including Tottenham's three Belgians – Jan Vertonghen, Mousa Dembele and Nacer Chadli - who were not involved at Upton Park.
