A group of Good Samaritan paramedics watched on as their ambulance went up in flames on Tuesday morning, after pulling over to help a driver whose van had caught fire near a busy Melbourne shopping centre.

Noticing the smoke billowing through his cabin, Dennis Finnigan, the van's driver, tried to extinguish the flames, before attracting the attention of the passing ambulance.

While the paramedics were checking everybody was safe and tried to move other cars away from the burning van, their ambulance managed to catch fire - after the burning van rolled back into it.

Travelling near Mulgrave's Waverley Gardens Shopping Centre, roughly 25 km southeast of the Melbourne CBD, Dennis said he was in the area to pay a bill on Tuesday morning.

'I was just merrily driving along and a big pool of smoke came into the cabin and I thought I better get out and have a look at this,' he told 3AW's Neil Mitchell.

"I just hopped out, lifted the seat and thought ‘Hello, the motor is on fire’. I threw a rug over it but that wasn’t enough to put it out."

'Then it burst into flames,' he said.

An ambulance passing by noticed the burning 1995 Toyota HiAce and pulled over, to ensure that everyone was okay.

'The burning vehicle has later rolled into the parked ambulance, causing damage to the ambulance,' Ambulance Victoria acting group manager Rob Heaslip said.

Despite the damage to one of their ambulances, Mr Heaslip can see the silver lining.

'We are pleased that there have been no injuries,' he admits.

Speaking with 3AW Radio's Neil Mitchell not long after the incident took place, Mr Finnigan wasn't distressed by the damage.

When asked what was the most distressing thing about the incident, he was blunt.

'My wallet was in it,' he said.
