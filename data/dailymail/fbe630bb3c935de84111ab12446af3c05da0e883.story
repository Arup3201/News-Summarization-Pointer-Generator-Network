A Korean man kidnapped and killed numerous pet dogs in his Argentine neighbourhood so he could sell their meat to a local supermarket, it is claimed.

The 70-year-old allegedly swiped family pets off the streets of Buenos Aires and fed them for several days to boost their size.

He is then accused of decapitating them with a machete and taking them to an Asian supermarket in the Flores district where the owners - who were also Korean - sold them on.

Police started investigating the man, who has not been named, after a neighbour reported the disappearance of her two pet dogs.

She became suspicious of the pensioner, and police raided his Florencio Varela district home on Tuesday.

Officers reportedly found the corpses of two dogs which were about to be taken to the supermarket, and another freshly-killed puppy hanging from a hook.

The senior citizen was arrested, reports Diario Popular.

But he was released just hours later after police admitted he had not committed a criminal offence, as under Argentine law his actions were only an administrative infraction.

A police spokesman did reveal, however, that the man was suffering from ill mental health.

Prosecutor Dario Provisionato said that the dog meat was being sold to members of the Korean community in the capital city.

He added that police were now investigating whether the owners of the supermarket were selling the meat to Argentine locals as if it was beef.
