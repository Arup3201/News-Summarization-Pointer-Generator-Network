A mother accused of making false claims that she and her son had cancer was arrested by police on her way to appear on the Dr Phil TV show.

Melissa D. Barton, 25, from Troy, South Illinois, was arrested by police at Abraham Lincoln Capitol Airport in Springfield as she headed towards Chicago to film Dr Phil. 

Troy Police Chief Brad Parsons said she was stopped by officers and charged with theft by deception - similar to charges brought against her on August 5.

According to police, Ms Barton 
carried out her scam on social media, in person, and at a local church where she asked for 
cash donations for her cash-strapped family.

She used a website called 'Youcaring.com and wepay.com to garner sympathy for her and her son by putting up photographs of herself looking unwell in bed. 

The additional charges of theft by deception came about because a second victim was located since she had been first charged 10 days ago.

It’s alleged that she accepted donations from people she'd told that she and her son had leukemia.

However, she was arrested on a warrant in Springfield and was transferred from Springfield to Madison County and jailed on a $100,000 bail on Friday.

But she was not considered a flight risk at any point, according to Chief Parsons.

He told The Belleville News Democrat: ‘We heard that she was on her way to Chicago to be on the 'Dr. Phil' show.’

Police said that she used the names Melissa Dawn Pruett Barton and Missy Barton Pruett during the scam.

Ms Barton was initially charged over the deception on August 5.

She was jailed on a $50,000 bail after the first charge but was able to pay for a bond to get her out of jail.

Troy Police have confirmed that they will continue to investigate her case.

Chief Parsons said: ‘Right now I can tell you that the case isn't closed. We're following every lead and looking for more victims. But no additional charges are imminent.’

Anyone with information is asked to contact Troy Police at 618-667-6731.
