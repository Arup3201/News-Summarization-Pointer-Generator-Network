A postman who dumped hundreds of letters and parcels has been fined more than £2,300.

Sandeep Singh refused to deliver in Nottingham because he said his Royal Mail bag was too heavy.

He had lost more than three stone after breaking up with his girlfriend, a court heard. To lighten his load, the 27-year-old threw parcels away or hoarded them at his home.

Nottingham magistrates were told he dumped 229 letters in bins over three weeks, deeming them 'unimportant junk mail'. He kept 50 items of post in his car boot and in his bedroom in Bramcote.

Singh pleaded guilty to theft and delaying delivery of post, but was spared jail on Thursday. He was sentenced to 200 hours of unpaid work and must pay £2,384.32.

Chairman of the bench Geoffrey Walker told Singh he was 'foolish', adding: 'You were paid to do a job which you failed to do.'

'Theft and deprivation of any sort is not pleasant for anybody. 

'However, we don't believe that the acts you carried out were of the sort we often hear of, where it is a malicious act in order to deprive people of money.

'It was foolish, I think, rather than malicious.'

The court heard Singh had been a postman for only seven months when his actions were discovered in August last year.

He was caught out when binmen discovered piles of post when emptying the bins and he was sacked from his job.

The disgraced postman later told police he was struggling with the heavy bags and regularly took out items to throw away.

Paul Wright, prosecuting, said: 'He said he was struggling with his duties..

'He often found the bags so heavy that he took out items he thought were unimportant.

'A large amount were classed as 'downstream access mail', often used by big companies. They often contain marketing information.

'But, by the same token, that same method of mail is used to deliver your phone bill, bank statements and credit card bills.

'All the items were personally addressed to individuals by name.'

None of the 279 letters Singh failed to deliver were opened and the postie made no financial gain from the thefts.

David Henson, defending, said he had broken up with his girlfriend and had lost a large amount of weight, which could have contributed to his problems in carrying his mailbags.

He said: 'The [break-up] had a traumatic effect on him and he lost three-and-a-half stone.

'I wonder if that had an effect on the amount of bags he could carry on his rounds.

'He tried to sift out the items he thought would not be lost to people - things the majority of people would call junk mail. Some of it wasn't but a lot of it was.

'He pleaded guilty on the first occasion and has never been in trouble before.'

After the case a spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: 'Royal Mail has a zero tolerance approach to any dishonesty.

'The safety and security of mail is of the utmost importance to this business and Royal Mail will not allow the actions of any individual to damage the good reputation of our thousands of hard-working postmen and women.'
