Authorities took Eugene, Ore., man Jeffrey Wright Leonard, 57, into custody Friday on felony chargers of conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation for murder for allegedly trying to have his neighbor killed

The man called the the 'world's worst neighbor'  is in jail after police say they caught him trying to hire someone to kill his neighbor.

Authorities took Eugene, Oregon, man Jeffrey Wright Leonard, 57, into custody on Friday and charged him with conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation for murder.

Leonard, who was picked up near Autzen Stadium, is now being held at Lane County Jail. 

The Register-Guard reports that Leonard allegedly asked a 30-year-old jail inmate - that he shared a cell with earlier in the year - to kill his neighbor.

Leonard allegedly wanted his former cellmate to crash his vehicle into the neighbor's car on Highway 99.

However, the inmate decided to report Leonard to the  jailhouse deputy and said Leonard had given him the neighbor's route to work and asked for the hit to take place on Friday.

Leonard even gave a description of the car and license plate. 

'We’re convinced this man meant business, and if our source was not going to agree to kill this guy, somebody else would,' Sgt. Scott McKee told The Register-Guard.

Leonard faces a minimum prison sentence of more than seven years. 

The neighbors had long feuded.

Vocativ reports Leonard was known for shining flood lights into his neighbor's homes and even flinging dog feces at them. 

It's unclear how much money Leonard promised the inmate for the murder.

The pair met while sharing a cell several months ago after Leonard was booked on charges of violating a restraining order and contempt of court.

Those charges were related to an entirely different neighbor Leonard has issues with.  

Authorities have not specified what charges the inmate was jailed over.a

Leonard has established a pattern of being the neighborhood antagonist.

In November 2013 he was slapped with a restraining order by a neighbor for attempting to 'run me off the road while I was driving,' say court documents.

Business Insider reports that Leonard told the unidentified neighbor 'that he was going to terrorize me till I moved.'

That same neighbor renewed the restraining order twice over the next 11 months after being pelted with dog feces and hit with floodlights.

Yet another neighbor filed a stalking protective order against him in March 2014. That neighbor claimed he threw rocks at her home and screamed profanities at her family.

'Being he has reached an unpredictable state, I fear that anything he says could and may happen,' she told the court. 'I now have no idea of what he is capable of.' 

Yet when brought to court, he claimed to be fighting bone cancer and the victim of neighbors trying to terrorize him during his recovery. 

Leonard would've wanted the murder committed after the inmate was released but its unclear exactly what that timetable would be. 

'We have these cases where people say they want to have someone killed, but do they really mean it and really mean it a month later?' McKee told reporters. '(Leonard) is still as agitated and as serious as he was a month ago.'
