Ed Miliband’s chief spin doctor, Tom Baldwin allegedly told BBC’s Nick Robinson that the Labour leader had seen the HSBC scandal as 'another Milly Dowler moment’

My first rule of political scandals is that they don’t matter unless people are talking about them in the pub.

Any important scandal needs a moment that turns them from a storm in the Westminster teacup to a topic of debate in The George. With MPs’ expenses, it was Sir Peter Viggers’ duck pond. With phone hacking, it was Milly Dowler’s voicemails. And with Andrew Mitchell, it wasn’t the fact that he swore at police officers; it was that much-disputed word ‘pleb’.

This week, the release of secret files on HSBC’s Swiss banking operations has set off a political firestorm, but as Westminster pores over the ashes and wonders where the scandal goes next, the real question is what – if anything – will get people talking down at the pub?

It should be the facts that at least 1,000 wealthy Britons used HSBC’s Swiss banking arm to evade tax; that only one has so far faced prosecution; and that – at the height of the investigation into the case – the boss of HSBC was made a Government Minister by David Cameron.

That stinks to high heaven.

As someone who worked both at HMRC and at the Treasury, I am incredulous that Ministers were unaware of HSBC’s involvement in the Swiss scandal when Stephen Green, the bank’s former chief executive, was made a Minister.

In theory, HMRC staff with access to confidential tax data are not supposed to share the details with Treasury officials and Ministers. The reality is that – whenever a case is deemed sensitive, either because of the individual or company involved, the scale of the evasion, or in HSBC’s case, both – the taxman will find a way of informing the Treasury, not least to cover their backs if it all goes wrong. They will usually do so face-to-face rather than in writing so there is no record of taxpayer confidentiality being breached.

In 2004, I was warned by a Revenue official that his staff were planning to present a £100,000 tax bill to a pop star while he was signing records in London. He said: ‘Obviously, I can’t tell you who it is’, then walked out of my office singing Peter Andre’s Mysterious Girl.

But when the Swiss case emerged in 2010, it wasn’t just HMRC’s job to inform the Treasury of HSBC’s involvement. It should have been the Treasury demanding to know what was going on, who was involved, what revenue was at stake, and what action needed to be taken.

Ed Miliband was said to have seen it as an opportunity to stand up to the powerful, just as he did when the hacking story involving murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler (pictured) broke

In December 2012, George Osborne announced a deal with Switzerland that he called the ‘largest tax evasion settlement in British history’. That was no small matter: the £5 billion the settlement was forecast to raise allowed the Chancellor to claim that Government borrowing had fallen not risen in 2012. Are we expected to believe that he and his officials prepared that deal without ever asking HMRC what they knew about tax evasion in Swiss banks?

I am reluctant to believe the Treasury is lying, and I do not believe they are wholly incompetent, so I am forced to a third uncomfortable theory. They were never told because they chose not to ask, and put their fingers in their ears when HMRC tried to tell them. Why? Because in government, once you officially know something, you have to publicly do something, or you will one day be accused of a cover-up.

In this case, Stephen Green would need to have been sacked, donations to the Tories from tax evaders would need to have been returned, and prosecutions brought against those 1,000 wealthy individuals, rather than settlements agreed with them. Far better for Osborne and his Ministers to act like the wise monkeys, and hope that HSBC’s involvement was never publicly exposed.

THAT is the real scandal, and if Ed Miliband and his office had done their job, that is what would have been on tonight’s agenda at the pub.

Miliband’s task was to expose the facts of the HSBC case in a way everyone could understand, and then forensically pick apart the Government’s ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ defence. Instead, the Labour leader was diverted into a demeaning squabble over the tax affairs of former Tory Treasurer Baron Fink, and then broadened his assault to the entire practice of tax avoidance.

This week, the release of secret files on HSBC’s private banking operations- revealing at least 1,000 wealthy Britons used HSBC’s Swiss banking arm to evade tax-  has set off a political firestorm

 Not only did that distract attention from the HSBC case, and allow Cameron to question Labour’s record on tax avoidance, it has also exposed the Labour Party, its donors, peers and MPs, and Miliband himself to a frenzied media investigation into their own tax affairs.

Even worse, Miliband’s chief spin doctor, Tom Baldwin, then had a conversation with the BBC’s Nick Robinson, which led Nick to write: ‘The Labour leader’s aides say that he sees this as another Milly Dowler moment.’ The BBC man clarified that the phrase was not a direct quote, but that Miliband saw this as a moment to stand up to the powerful, just as he did when the hacking story broke.

That Baldwin did not say the actual words ‘Milly Dowler moment’ is welcome, just as it is welcome that Emily Thornberry’s picture of England flags in Rochester was not accompanied by the words: ‘Get me back to Islington.’ But what matters is the sentiment, not the words.

As I noted earlier, the Milly Dowler story provoked a spontaneous outpouring of public outrage which brought the hacking scandal to national attention. Miliband did not make that happen, but he appeared to speak for the country when calling for resignations and an inquiry.

Now all the public can see – based on his spin doctor’s own analysis – is that Miliband was not sharing their outrage; he was exploiting it. Baldwin’s thinking betrays a man who has played the Westminster chess game too long and thinks only of tactics and gambits. As someone who was a liability in my job long before I was forced to quit, I know the signs, and the fact Baldwin could not even hear how appalling his analysis sounded is one.

As it is, he has ensured that if the punters’ conversation in the pub does turn to this week’s scandal, the cynical comparison with their anger over Milly Dowler will be what is best remembered and most guaranteed to offend. Ed Miliband has not just missed an open goal this week; he and his foolish spin doctor have crashed a spectacular 100-yard volley back into Labour’s net.
