A high school senior has won her case over atheists to keep ' under God' in the pledge of allegiance.

Samantha Jones from Highland Regional High School in Blackwood, New Jersey, has defeated efforts by the American Humanist Association to remove the phrase, insisting it is a student's right to read the pledge in its entirety.

A judge in Monmouth County threw out the latest attempt to have the phrase banished from the pledge because it did not violate the state's constitution.

The teenager described America as a country of many beliefs and claimed everyone, including atheists, are protected by 'one nation under God.'

In a statement released Friday, she said: 'I'm so grateful the court decided that kids like me shouldn't be silenced just because some people object to timeless American values.' 

'Ever since I was little, I've recited the Pledge of Allegiance because it sums up the values that make our country great. The phrase 'under God' protects all Americans-including atheists-because it reminds the government that it can't take away basic human rights because it didn't create them.' 

Eric Rassbach, Deputy General Counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty added: 'The message today is loud and clear: ''God'' is not a dirty word. The Pledge of Allegiance isn't a prayer, and reciting it doesn't magically create an official state religion.'

Support: The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who ran this campaign to protect the phrase in the pledge, celebrated the victory, saying it proves God is not a dirty word 

The legal battle first began when an unnamed family, identified in court papers as John and Jane Doe and their child, sued the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District in February 2014, alleging the phrase 'under God' in the pledge is discriminatory.

The case was filed by the American Humanist Association, which claimed the recitation of the pledge violates Article 1 of the state's constitution. 

Samantha was at another school at the time and decided to fight back.  

She told Fox News in November: 'I don't think that it's as much about religion as it is about our rights. Everyone has the right to remain silent but they don't have the right to silence everybody else.' 

Relieved: In a statement released Friday, Samantha said she was 'grateful the court decided that kids like me shouldn't be silenced just because some people object to timeless American values.'

The Pledge of Alleigance was composed in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, but the phrase 'under God' was not added for around 50 years. 

Louis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was said to be the first person to include the phrase in 1948 while marking President Lincoln's birthday.

In 1951, the Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization, also began including the words 'under God' in the Pledge.

It then became a mainstay in schools and institutions across the country.

The introduction of 'under God' in the 1950s was done during the Cold War, as a way to differentiate the U.S. from the concept of communist state atheism, according to author Scott Merriman.

Proponents of including 'under God' in the Pledge argue the United States is a inherently Christian nation, with at least 80 per cent supporting it, including to Pro Con.

Those in favor of it say the language reflects America's civic culture and is not a religious statement, and federal law, state constitutions, and US currency already contain references to God.

Opponents contend that church and state should be kept strictly separate as the Founding Fathers intended. 

They also argue that the Constitution protects minority rights against majority will, thus insist that 'under God' in the Pledge is religious phrase and violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
