Its idyllic landscape of rolling fields and poplar-lined hills have proved irresistible to the great, the good and the very rich.

But in recent months the gentle vistas of Tuscany have become home to a savage predator - packs of marauding wolves which are growing increasingly brazen.

Politicians in Chianti-country have warned that attacks are now reaching 'crisis levels' and have called on the government to take action. There are growing fears that the wolves could attack humans.

Antonio Gambetta Vianna, a local councillor, has called for a task force to be sent in to tackle the packs.

'The last three attacks have occurred in broad daylight and near
homes and farming buildings,' he said. 'This shows that the wolves no longer 
afraid of anything.'

Any attacks on humans are likely to put people off visiting the area, he added.

The wolves have been driven down from the Appennine mountains because of the unusually cold weather.

Packs have struck livestock in the 
region’s picturesque hills and vales once a week for the last two 
months, with the feral animals seemingly fearless in approaching 
livestock and farm buildings, 

Some strikes have occurred in broad 
daylight in areas around Sienna, Lucca and the Val d'Orcia incidating wolves have lost their innate fear of man.

Tuscany is home to a large number of British expats and receives an estimated 40million tourists every year.

It has also attracted a number of famous faces as a holiday destination including Sting, Mick Jagger, Queen Beatrix of Holland, the Duchess of York and most famously Tony Blair.

The former Prime Minister was given the nickname 'Tuscan Tony' after his frequent visits to the region.

Maurizio Forriero of Lucca Forestry 
Commission said: ‘Numbers of wolves have been on the rise spontaneously,
without any help from humans.

‘In the past when it was in competition with man there was a lot of illegal hunting but this has decreased.

But when its cold and there is a lot of snow it is hard for them to find food so they come down from the mountains.'

Rolling hills: The stunning landscape of Tuscany lures millions of tourists every year

A number of famous faces are known to have enjoyed stays in Tuscany, which is home to a large number of British expats, including singer Sting and former Prime Minister Tony Blair

As
this month’s heavy snowfall has driven their usual prey including wild 
boar and hares down into the lowlands the wolves have followed.

The
latest strike, in Garfagnana near Lucca over the weekend left the 
unmistakeable footprints of four feral predators in the snow.

The shepherd had witnessed the slaughter from a distance but decided it was too dangerous to intervene.

Alberto
Focacci, of the Italian Farmers Confederation in Lucca, said that 
wolves had never before ventured so low into the valleys in this part of
Tuscany.

He added: ‘The seriousness of the situation should not be 
underestimated’ In the past, wolves have been known to savage shepherds that get between the predator and the flock.

Wolves were reintroduced to Tuscany from the mountains of the Abruzzo in the 1990s, using EU funding.

They have since been growing in numbers, as illegal hunting by farmers has become less common and there are now an estimated 230 in Tuscany .

Wolf attacks are responsible for 1000 sheep, cattle and horses killed last year, according to official figures.
