George Osborne’s opposition to a plastic bag tax is the last remaining barrier to the introduction of a levy in England, Liberal Democrats claimed today as they voted to bolster their ‘weaponry’ against the Treasury’s resistance.

The Lib Dem conference backed a motion demanding a levy on all single-use plastic bags, with proceeds to go to community food initiatives.

Senior party figures said the move was designed to counter what they said was a Treasury ‘log jam’ which had repeatedly blocked the idea of charging for bags to encourage people to curb their use.

The Liberal Democrats claim the Treasury is the last stumbling block to securing a levy on plastic bags to cut pollution

A poll by the Break the Bag Habit coalition of campaign groups last week found more than half people – 56 per cent – supported the idea of a small charge for disposable bags.

Official figures show around 350million more bags were given out by retailers over last year, despite David Cameron demanding ‘significant falls’.

Lib Dems say Caroline Spelman, the former Tory Environment Secretary, was supportive of the idea of a levy but came up against Treasury resistance, something the Treasury denies.

After Mr Osborne proposed taxes on pasty and caravans - sparking a public outcry and leading to embarrassing u-turns - it was claimed the Treasury was reluctant to appear to be adding to the day-to-day costs of low income families.

But Andrew George, the Lib Dem policy spokesman on the environment, today told MailOnline he hoped the adoption of a new party policy on the issue would place the issue back on the agenda.

Lib Dem MP Andrew George said the new party policy ensured campaigners had the 'most effective weaponry' in taking on the Treasury's resistance

‘We have seen some indications of support coming out of Number 10,’ he said.

‘It has always been over-ruled by the Treasury. We have only one remaining log jam and we need to keep firing the most effective weaponry at it and making it quite clear that this issue will not go away.’

However Treasury insiders were said to be ‘bemused’ by the suggestion that Mr Osborne was blocking the policy. ‘All ideas are on the table,’ said a source. ‘And the Lib Dems know that.’

In Wales shoppers are charged 5p for carrier bags with the money going to good causes. The Republic of Ireland has had a levy since 2002, and has seen significant drops in plastic bag use.

Last year Mr Cameron said the level of bag use was ‘unacceptable’ and government sources suggested there had to be a reduction of five per cent.

Instead the number rose by around five per cent to 6.75billion for 2011-12.

Mr George added: ‘We need to bear down on excessive landfill. It is a cause of very significant pollution not just in the waste stream but around the countryside.

‘It is quite unnecessary. There are just so many alternatives to having a ready supply of free plastic bags.

‘It is a very simple, straight forward hit,’ the MP for St Ives told MailOnline.

Lib Dem activist Justine McGuinness told the conference that she had changed her mind about the need for a levy after visiting Ireland where there were not bags in hedgerows

The Lib Dems are pushing for a levy of between 5p and 10p per bag.

‘It has got to be sufficient to make people think hard before going out shopping, planning in advance, and taking reusable bags with them where they can.

‘We don’t want to penalise people who find themselves in a situation where they have no alternative but we do need to change behaviour.

‘Behaviour is changing, but it seems to be that the political will isn’t there to tip things in the right direction.’

The Lib Dem motion was backed by delegates at the party conference in Brighton after being urged to do so by Justine McGuinness, a former election candidate who acted as a spokesman for or Kate and Gerry McCann's Find Madeleine Fund.

Ms McGuinness said she used to be against the party’s policy on plastic bags but had changed her mind after visiting Ireland.

‘You don’t see plastic bags floating around in hedgerows because of course there is a plastic bag tax.

'It has changed people’s behaviour and that to me is a sign of a very good policy. It is a policy which will effect change.’
