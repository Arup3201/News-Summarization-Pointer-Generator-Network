Ironbridge Gorge, often heralded as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, is under 'extreme' threat from landslides, according to a new report.

The Shropshire World Heritage Site, which consists of 18th century iron works, huge kilns and even a Victorian town, is set to undergo a £12million overhaul to save it from further erosion.

But ground monitoring in Jackfield near the site, has unearthed 'disturbing' findings of constant land movement towards the river as recently as last winter.

Under threat: Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire is said to face 'extreme' risk of landslides

Stunning: The historical area is home to ten museums and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year

An action plan was revealed between 
Telford and Wrekin and Shropshire councils to stabilise an area covering
7.6 acres of the historic site.

The report reveals for the first time the extent of the work necessary - and the consequences of doing nothing.

Some stabilisation work has already taken place in the area but the report’s author, planning officer Valerie Hulme, says more action is 'absolutely necessary'.

She warned the river gorge, visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, could be blocked by a landslide, causing flooding.

Extensive preventative measures are deemed 'vital' for the long term survival of residents, business and tourism in the area.

A total of 350 metres along the river at Salthouse Road, rising 250 metres into Jackfield, will be underpinned and roads and footpaths realigned.

World first: The iconic bridge over the River Severn was built by Abraham Darby III in 1779

A new road, car park and river viewing areas would also be created by the plan, which is recommended to get the go-ahead by planners next week.

Ms Hulme warned: 'Extreme events in the Gorge where the land slips into the River Severn are not theoretical, they are real, having happened twice in the past 60 years.

'The ground monitoring undertaken in this area is disturbing, showing constant movement, most recently over the winter.'

Significant landslides have been recorded around Salthouse Road since the 1880s.

In 1952, six houses were lost, around 300,000 tonnes of ground moved and the river reduced from 38.1m wide to 24.4m and in 1983 Salthouse Road was swept into the river.

The latest stabilisation project is expected to take two years.

Historic: The area was made a Unesco world heritage site in 1986 - putting it alongside the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, the Great Wall of China and the Pyramids in Egypt in terms of its historical importance

Ironbridge Gorge was described by writer Charles Hulbert in 1837 as 'the most extraordinary district in the world'.

The iconic bridge over the River Severn was built by Abraham Darby III in 1779 and was the first of its kind in the world.

The location of the bridge was chosen because East Shropshire was an important industrial area because of the huge coal deposits near the surface.

It was made a Unesco world heritage site in 1986 - putting it alongside the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, the Great Wall of China and the Pyramids in Egypt in terms of its historical importance.

The Gorge and its ten museums spread along the valley by the River Severn attract 500,000 visitors every year bringing £20million to the local economy of Telford and Wrekin and the wider Shropshire area.
