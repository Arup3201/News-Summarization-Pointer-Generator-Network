A so-called Christian 'love guru' who tours the country telling teens that women must 'know how to shut up' if they want to get a date and men must 'fight battles' and keep girls 'covered up' has sparked outrage at a Texas high school.

Justin Lookadoo, a bleach-blonde former juvenile probation officer, claims to have given motivational talks at some 4,000 public schools throughout the South and Midwest, preaching in his heavy Texas drawl 'all the juicy secrets' to help students pick up.

But students at Richardson High School in Dallas walked out of his speech Wednesday and others confronted him afterwards, asking questions like: 'Why did you tell girls to get out of abusive relationships instead of telling guys not to be abusive in the first place?'

Website: Lookadoo claims on his website to have given thousands of motivational speeches about his 'Dateable' plan, in which he preaches in his heavy Texas drawl 'all the juicy secrets' to help students pick up

Others later tweeted their disgust at his misogynistic comments, using the hashtag #lookadouche.

'Honestly the speaker we had today, Justin Lookadoo, disgusted me with his out of line jokes about women,' Anah Delgado tweeted.

Victoria Bryrom tweeted: 'According to Justin Lookadoo I'm undateable because I talk too much.'

Lookadoo offers a snippet of his 'Dateable' program on YouTube he in which he declares 'Dateable girls know how to shut up. They don't monopolize the conversation. Let him lead. God made guys as leaders.'

Meanwhile, for boys he recommends maintaining dominance.

'Men of God are wild, not 
domesticated,' he claims. 'Dateable guys aren’t tamed. They don’t live 
by the rules of the opposite sex. They fight battles, conquer lands, and
 stand up for the oppressed.

'Keep it covered up. Dateable guys know that porn is bad for the spirit and the mind. They keep women covered up.'

In
 a book he claims is a number one bestseller, he tells girls, 'Please, 
please don't tease us. To show us your hot little body ... and then tell
 us we can't touch it is being a tease. You can't look that sexy and 
then tell us to be on our best behavior.'

Lookadoo
 defended his speech in Richmond, an overwhelmingly conservative and 
Christian community but the school district later apologized to parents 
and students.

However, the talk had already created a firestorm of reaction.

'This man should not be allowed anywhere near a high school,' Sarah Moon wrote on the Facebook page of a Dallas TV station.

'My son is a sophomore at RHS and we are a Christian family. However, I believe discussions of this nature are best dealt with at home as many of the "datable" rules on his website are narrow minded and discriminatory toward both genders,' another commenter, Libby Gordon, wrote, though others defended him.

Lookadoo told NBC 5 that his message was simply 'empowering the student to actually take control of their relationships.'
