Killed in battle: Richard III

After his last resting place beneath a council car park, anything would be an improvement for Richard III.

But following one row over whether his remains should be reburied in Leicester or York, a new dispute emerged yesterday over how grand the tomb should be.

Despite calls for an elaborate memorial, it seems the last Plantagenet king will have to make do with something much more simple within Leicester Cathedral.

The cathedral’s design brief specifies a preference for ‘a place of simple dignity’ – an engraved memorial stone.

It informs architects the church authorities would like to ‘mark the place of burial with a ledger stone’ which sits flat on the floor, possibly with a ‘decorative border’.

Anything more grandiose would be ‘disproportionate’.

The new monument will be placed on the spot where a memorial stone commemorating the 15th century king currently sits within the chancel.

‘While the remains of an English king are of historical significance, it should not be forgotten that Richard demonstrated both the honourable and dishonourable characteristics of human beings,’ the brief states.

‘Opportunities for prayer and reflection should focus on themes of sin and redemption, justice and peace.’

The proposal was greeted with dismay by Philippa Langley of the Richard III Society, who led the campaign to search for the king’s remains which were unearthed last year under the car park near Leicester Cathedral.

She
had commissioned a raised limestone tomb embellished with Richard’s 
symbols and said she was ‘shocked and disappointed’ by the design brief.

The remains will be interred in Leicester Cathedral in May next year, with a large memorial service

‘From the very beginning of my search 
for Richard, I always said that we would honour him with a tomb – one 
fitting for a king of England,’ Miss Langley said.

‘We designed an 
incredibly understated tomb to fit with a modern cathedral, not a 
pastiche of a medieval tomb.’

Richard was killed at the Battle of 
Bosworth Field, near Leicester, in 1485. His defeat marked the end of 
the War of the Roses and the rise of the Tudor dynasty.

He
has been portrayed as a power-mad child killer who slaughtered his two 
young nephews – the Princes in the Tower – to seize the throne. Others 
claim he was a visionary reformer.

Some
believe Richard, who belonged to the House of York, should be reburied 
at York Minster. But it appears his final burial place will be in 
Leicester Cathedral.

One woman's hunch led to the discovery of the skeleton which has now been proven to be that of Richard III.

Screenwriter
Philippa Langley, pictured right, said she felt a chill on a hot 
summer's day as she walked through the area where it was thought he was 
buried.

The
remarkable discovery of the remains, which, consistent with historical 
accounts of Richard, have both a curved spine back and wounded skull, 
was made last September.

Miss
Langley was strolling across the car park used by Leicester social 
services while researching a play about the king when she felt a chill 
in August 2009.

'It
was a hot summer and I had goosebumps so badly and I was freezing cold.
I walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew I was walking on 
his grave,' she told the Sunday Times.

'I am a rational human being but the feeling I got was the same feeling I have had before when a truth is given to me.'

Miss
Langley initially funded the excavation of what is now a Leicester City
Council car park because she was '99 per cent certain' that the remains
were those of Richard.

Miss
Langley, who is a member of the Richard III Society, is working on a 
documentary charting the excavation for Channel 4 titled Richard III: 
The King in the Car Park, which has been made alongside the university 
academics and will be screened tonight. She
said the her play has been turned into a script for television and 
film, which is now 'getting serious interest from Los Angeles and in the
UK'.
