Overcoming sharks, violent storms and frightening hallucinations, a British adventurer has become the first woman to row solo across the North Pacific Ocean.

Sarah Outen, 28, arrived in Adak in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska on Monday after rowing 3,750 miles in her boat Happy Socks and, incredibly, proposed to her girlfriend Lucy from the middle of the sea using a satellite phone.

Miss Outen, from Rutland, believes she is the first person to complete the voyage and celebrated with a bottle of champagne, greeting community members and supporters - her first human contact in nearly five months.

She said: 'I have had some of the most intense and memorable months of my life out on the Pacific,' she said. It has been brilliant and brutal at the same time. And it has been a privilege.

'But I have pushed myself to my absolute limits both physically and mentally to make land here in Alaska, and body and mind are now exhausted.'

The rower capsized five times during her treacherous journey and was confined to her cabin for days because of the perilous conditions.

Plummeting temperatures and poor light made rowing 'incredibly demanding'.

In recent days she was almost hit by a
cargo ship after her radar failed. Outen also tweeted about white-out 
fog and exhaustion-induced hallucinations in the final, treacherous 
miles to Adak.

But she still managed to propose to her partner from the middle of the ocean.

'I cannot wait to be with Lucy again,” she said, as she arrived on dry land.

It is the second time Miss Outen has attempted such a feat. Last year she attempted to cross the Pacific but was forced to abandon her challenged when she was caught in a tropical storm.

This time she planned to paddle from Japan to Canada but changed her route when she was battered by high winds and bad weather.

Mr Outen’s trip forms part of a round-the-world expedition. She hopes to eventually circle the globe using only human power: cycling, rowing and kayaking more than 20,000 miles.

Next year she will return to the Aleutian Islands to kayak to mainland Alaska. She aims to raise more than £100,000 for charity.
