Boris Johnson today took on his critics to insist he is a 'totally different' person to the last time he was an MP and set his sights on a serious government job.

He defended his decision to stand for Parliament next year while still London Mayor, amid a backlash from Tory MPs who suspect he will not be a team player. 

But his attempt to present himself as a man ready to take the tough decisions was overshadowed when he inexplicably appeared at a photocall wearing goggles and purple gloves to prune a tree.

Without telling David Cameron in advance, Mr Johnson dramatically announced yesterday that he plans to stand for Parliament in May next year and is hunting for a seat. 

There is already talk that Mr Johnson has already assembled a 'kitchen cabinet' to run not just his leadership campaign but to support him in the first months of his premiership.

For many voters, the reports will be at odds with his chaotic and crumpled appearance.

Those in Westminster with long memories also recall that when he was last in the Commons he regularly made news for the wrong reasons, including sparking a row with Jamie Oliver, upsetting the people of Liverpool and resigning from the frontbench over allegations of having an affair.

But today Mr Johnson insisted he was a change man. In an interview with the Evening Standard, he said: 'Yeah, I think I'm genuinely totally different. I mean, whether human beings ever change is a good question, isn't it.

'But if you do a job like this in London for a very long time, and you see the way people depend on you getting it right, and you have to engage with people who really feel that fares are too high, who are really being hurt by it, or people who cannot get a home for their children, I think you do. 

'I think I understand the business of government pretty well now. And I hope very much at some stage to be doing it.'

24 hours after announcing his plan to stand for Parliament next year, Mr Johnson also visited the Orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill today, where he pointed at met Rabbi Oscher Schapiro

The comments will be seen as a claim to be more in touch with voters, and a clear indication that he hopes to secure a Cabinet job in a future Tory government.

He will spend a year as London Mayor and an MP, before City Hall elections in 2016. He will then be free to join the frontbench.  

If the Conservatives are in government after the general election, he can expect a Cabinet job, but if David Cameron loses, he will be in prime position to launch a leadership bid.

He played down such talk today: 'When Dave steps down in 2030 or so I will be too old. There’ll be a very wide field, probably including babes yet unborn.'

Mr Johnson's announcement that he will stand as an MP yesterday came as he answered questions following a speech on Europe at Bloomberg's London headquarters.

Bookmakers Ladbrokes responded by slashing the odds of Mr Johnson becoming the next Conservative leader from 5/1 to 9/4. 

Labour said it was a clear sign the Tories were turning in on themselves with Mr Cameron powerless to intervene. 

Amid claims Mr Johnson has his eye set on becoming Prime Minister, Nick Clegg warned the messy hair and 'bumbliness' is just a front to disguise his ruthless ambition.

He appeared dishevelled and sweaty during his speech at Bloomberg yesterday, but Nick Clegg suggested it was all part of an act to disguise his ruthlessness

Mr Clegg insisted that the messy hair and creased suit was part of an image as carefully managed as his political ambitions.

The Deputy Prime Minister said the London mayor liked to pretend he did not care about his appearance or career - but was actually 'fixated' with them..

Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: 'The thing about Boris Johnson is despite all the kind of clumsiness and bumbliness, he's actually a really, really ambitious politician...

'He treats his political ambition a bit like he treats his hair. He wants everyone to think that he doesn't really care, but he actually really, really does care.'

The Lib Dem leader said Mr Johnson had until now been able to 'have his cake and eat it'.

'He will have to come clean about the fact that he is in many ways a much more conventional politician than he likes to appear,' Mr Clegg said.

'His tousled hair, his bumbliness, his humour, all of that is great... all I am saying is behind all of that is someone who is absolutely fixated with his own political ambitions. In that sense, he is actually a very conventional politician.

'In a sense, being a mayor is great, a wonderful position to have, but you can kind of have your cake and eat it. You can sort of lob grenades into the political debate without having to take responsibility for stuff.

'At some point he is actually going to have to say 'I'm going to do responsible stuff, I've got to take difficult decisions'.' 

The Deputy Prime Minister used his weekly radio phone-in to claim Mr Johnson's political ambitions actually made him quite 'conventional'

Deciding to stand for election is just the first step for Boris Johnson - now he must find a seat.

With just nine months to go until the general election, most sitting Tory MPs have either decided to stand again, or have quit and already had a successor selected. 

Mr Johnson will need a constituency close to London, which rules out Louth and Horncastle.

And there must be a vacancy, which should exclude Bromley and Chislehurst, where Bob Neill insists he will stand again.

Which makes Uxbridge most likely, just 20 miles from City Hall and Sir John Randall is standing down, leaving a health majority of more than 11,000. 

UXBRIDGE

Current MP: Sir John Randall, 59, is retiring

Majority: 11,216

Distance from City Hall: 20 miles

HERTSMERE

Current MP: James Clappison, 57, not re-adopted

Majority: 17,605

Distance from City Hall: 16 miles

HORNCHURCH & UPMINSTER

Current MP: Angela Watkinson, 72, still standing

Majority: 16,371

Distance from City Hall: 16 miles

LOUTH AND HORNCASTLE

Current MP: Sir Peter Tapsell, retiring

Majority: 13,871

Distance from City Hall: 150 miles

HENLEY

Current MP: John Howell, 59, standing again

Majority: 16,588

Distance from City Hall: 40 miles

CROYDON SOUTH

Current MP: Sir Richard Ottaway, 69, standing down

Majority: 15,818

Distance from City Hall: 12 miles

BROMLEY & CHISLEHURST

Current MP: Bob Neill, 62, standing again

Majority: 13,900

Distance from City Hall: 10 miles

Pressure had been growing on Mr Johnson over several months to finally say whether or not he will mount a bid to return to the Commons. He quit as MP for Henley in 2008 after being elected Mayor of London.

But since Mr Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010 there has been mounting speculation that Mr Johnson would seek a route back to Westminster, after vowing to only serve two terms at City Hall.

Mr Cameron has suggested his old friend could remain in charge of the capital and take a seat in Cabinet if he becomes an MP at the next election.

Yesterday Mr Johnson departed from tradition and gave a straight answer, confirming he would run for Parliament in the general election next year.

Speaking at Bloomberg in London, he said: 'I have danced around it for an awfully long time. The Prime Minster said ages ago that he would welcome me back. 

'It is also been pretty clear I cannot endlessly go on dodging these questions as I have tried to do.

'Let me put it this way. I haven't got any seat lined up yet. But I do think that in all probability, since you cannot do these things furtively, in all probability I will try to find somewhere to stand in 2015.' 

However, Labour accused Mr Johnson of breaking a pledge not to try to return to Parliament while he was still London Mayor.

In 2012 election he told the Evening Standard he would 'serve out that term in full' and keeping his 'solemn vow' to lead the capital out of recession and deliver growth 'cannot be combined with any other political capacity'. 

Every time a Tory safe seat has become available when an sitting MP has announced plans to stand down, Mr Johnson has been linked with it.

The most recent has been Uxbridge, where Tory MP Sir John Randall is retiring in 2015.

Mr Johnson's announcement came after a stridently Eurosceptic speech, during which he listed a series of hardline reforms he wants to see before agreeing to support a vote to stay in the EU.

Within hours, his return to Westminster was welcomed by a series of backbenchers who hope Mr Johnson can attract UKIP voters back to the Tories.

The Mayor does not even have a seat yet – although the recently vacated West London constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, a safe Tory seat, is up for grabs after the retirement of its sitting member.

Ladbrokes slashed the odds of Mr Johnson becoming the next Conservative leader from 5/1 to 9/4, while Labour said it was a clear sign the Tories were turning in on themselves with Mr Cameron powerless to intervene.

There was speculation last night that should Mr Johnson be elected and the Tories win the election with a comfortable majority, he could be offered a ministerial job at Business, Transport or another wide-ranging infrastructure role after he has stepped down as mayor.
