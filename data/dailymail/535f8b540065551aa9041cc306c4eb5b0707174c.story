A magnificent Kent house once owned by a Tory MP who numbered Lawrence of Arabia and Sir Winston Churchill among his friends has been reopened as a hotel by a conservation charity.

Port Lympne was the home of bachelor MP Sir Philip Sassoon, an Old Etonian and member of the Bullingdon Club, who represented Hythe from 1912 until his death in 1939.

He began to build Port Lympne near Hythe in Kent before the First World War and completed it after being demobbed, spending much of his vast fortune on its decoration and upkeep.

Port Lympne Mansion - construction began before the First World War by Sir Philip Sassoon and was completed in the Roaring Twenties

Simpson before her second divorce and marriage to the duke in June 1937;

Port Lympne

Sir Philip, a member of the Rothschild family, was a great host and regular visitors to the house and its stunning grounds included as well as Churchill and TE Lawrence, Edward and Mrs Simpson (the future Duke and Duchess of Windsor) and Charlie Chaplin.

The house is now the boutique Mansion Hotel, part of the newly renamed Port Lympne Reserve run by the Aspinall Foundation where animals roam free and visitors receive a safari-like experience.

The Mansion, where rooms cost from £172 per night, caters for private parties, weddings and corporate hospitality events as well as being suitable for a getaway break.

The Grade 2*-listed building has six en suite bedrooms and suites, each decorated in the style of the period.

The addition of the Mansion now enables Port Lympne Reserve to offer high-end accommodation alongside the nearby four-bedroom Livingstone Cottage, which was renovated in 2012.

Visitors looking for a luxury glamping experience can book into Elephant Lodge, which provides tented accommodation for up to eight guests, and views of the elephant paddocks at Port Lympne.

To meet the growing demand six new tents and a restaurant have been added for the 2014 season.

Bob O’Connor, the managing director of Port Lympne Reserve, said: ‘This investment and renaming as a Reserve is a major step forward in the future of our work here at Port Lympne, and underpins our efforts abroad.

‘It is also a significant investment and vote of confidence in the future of the tourism industry here in Kent. 

‘For us to continue to fund our international conservation work we have to make sure we are delivering what our customers want and make the most of what we have here at Port Lympne, and sister wildlife park Howletts.

'We are very optimistic for the future and have exciting plans to create a new Tree House Hotel, a luxurious treetop retreat offering breathtaking views across the park.

'Our plans for Pinewood would create an overnight education experience for school children in close proximity to the animal enclosures, giving our guests the real feeling of camping in the wild.’

‘We are 
now able to offer an unrivalled range of accommodation against the 
backdrop of this spectacular wildlife park and the English Channel.

‘The
 Mansion is stunning and guests will be able to wake up and walk in the 
footsteps of some of the most influential people and celebrities of the 
20th century.’
