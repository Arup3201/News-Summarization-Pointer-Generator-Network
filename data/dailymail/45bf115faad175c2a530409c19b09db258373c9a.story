More questions: Jack Straw wants Ed Miliband to investigate Unite

Former home secretary Jack Straw has urged Ed Miliband to take action over fresh evidence that Unite union officials attempted to rig the vote in the selection of a Labour party candidate.

Mr Straw said Mr Miliband ‘should actively consider re-opening the investigation’ into the selection process at the Falkirk constituency.

Mr Straw spoke out after emails were published that suggested Unite and its official Stephen Deans were instrumental in thwarting Labour’s initial investigation into the vote-rigging claims.

Mr Deans, who resigned from his job at the Grangemouth refinery on Monday after being accused of spending a quarter of his working day on union issues, is chairman of the Labour Party in Falkirk.

The scandal erupted after four members of the Kane family complained that they had been signed up as party members without their knowledge.

At the time, Mr Deans was trying to get Karie Murphy – a close friend of Unite boss Len McCluskey – selected as the Labour candidate.

The party held an internal investigation but Unite was cleared of wrongdoing in September when the Kanes retracted their evidence. A police investigation was also dropped.

However, emails printed by the Sunday Times suggest that Unite officials were instrumental in ensuring that the evidence was withdrawn.

In one message, dated July 30, Unite executive Howard Beckett said Mr Deans would arrange for the retractions to be signed by the Kane family. Mr Deans is related to a member of the family.

In a separate email sent on the same day, Mr Deans said he was ‘happy’ with the statements drawn up by Unite ‘and can get this to the Kane family and get it posted tonight’.

Last night, Labour sources said they could not act against Mr Deans because Mr Miliband had not seen the full cache of emails but Mr Straw suggested that the party investigation should be reopened.

He told the BBC’s Daily Politics programme that there was ‘a sufficient case presented by the Sunday Times for there to be further questions that will need to be dealt with’.

He suggested that Unite’s grandstanding over Mr Dean’s fate led to the threat by Grangemouth owners Ineos to close the plant last week – a threat lifted after Unite boss Len McCluskey dropped opposition to a company rescue plan.

'Catastrophic tactics': Unite boss Len McCluskey

Mr Straw accused Mr McCluskey of ‘catastrophic tactics’ and said: ‘To be blunt about it, my analysis is that Len McCluskey downwards put internal union Unite politics before the interests of their members at the Grangemouth plant.’

Eric Joyce, the MP for Falkirk who resigned from Labour after a brawl in a House of Commons bar, said Mr Miliband was frightened of Unite, Labour’s biggest paymaster.

He said: ‘The Labour Party is effectively keeping Deans in place, and I think it’s to some degree because of a substantial amount of fear inside the Labour Party of the Unite leadership.’

Mr Joyce said Unite was a ‘very great threat’ to the Labour party. ‘Unite came along and interfered with witnesses, and the inquiry was stopped in Falkirk,’ he said.

‘I think the Labour party should re-open the inquiry.’

But Andrew Murray, Unite’s chief of staff, said Mr Joyce had given a ‘wrong reading’ of the emails. He said that there was ‘no evidence’ that ‘anything untoward’ had taken place.

Mr McCluskey said: ‘We are witnessing a witch-hunt against Unite and Stevie Deans.

'The published material I have seen shows no basis for reopening the Falkirk wound.’

But in a letter to Mr Miliband, Tory MP Bob Neill wrote: ‘People in Britain deserve to know whether or not you will be strong enough to stand up to Len McCluskey and Unite.

'If you do not, they will draw their own conclusions as to your fitness to lead the country.’
