Pictures have emerged of those injured in a horror tour bus crash in Kenya which claimed the lives of two Australians and injured at least 14.

The Intrepid Travel tour bus, which was ferrying 25 people, overturned and plunged into a river on a notorious stretch of road west of Nairobi, the country's capital, on Sunday.

Local police identified the dead as a man and a woman in their 60s. One victim died on the spot, Kenyan media said.

The crash happened just outside the city of Nairobi in the East African country of Kenya

Narok County Governor Samuel ole Tunai (arms outstretched) visited the injured tourists in hospital.

The government said the spouses of the dead Australians were among those admitted to hospital. They suffered injuries and 'deep shock', a statement said.

The county government released images of local officials visiting the wounded at Narok County Referral Hospital on its Facebook page overnight.

Eighteen of the injured and all Intrepid Tours staff have now been flown to Nairobi for treatment.

In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia, James Thornton, the managing director of the Melbourne-based Intrepid Tours said:

'Our first concern is with those affected and their friends and families.

'Senior managers from our operations team in Kenya are assisting passengers and staff involved.'

County police commander Paul Kerich told local newspaper The Standard that the bus, which was carrying three staff and 22 tourists, was en route to Tanzania.

He described the crash zone was a renowned black spot.

'There are a lot of sharp bends and steep depressions a long this road.

'We want to appeal to drivers especially those who are new to exercise caution so as to avoid unnecessary deaths.'

The tourists on board were from the United Kingdom, the U.S., Germany, Switzerland and Australia.

Kenyan roads have a poor reputation. Just last August, 41 people were killed in a bus crash in Narok.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters the crash was tragic. 'It's awful beyond belief for the families of those involved,' he said on Monday morning.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular support to the families of those affected.
