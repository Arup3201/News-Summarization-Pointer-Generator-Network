Three, two, one! This is the incredible moment a baby giraffe is born in a matter of seconds and is just as quick to find his feet.

Keepers at the Santa Barbara Zoo in California captured the birth of Buttercup last Thursday afternoon.

Footage shows the leggy calf emerging headfirst from his mother, Audrey, who stands in her pen on all fours.

Soft landing: Buttercup's body gently flops to the ground, with his patchwork coat covered in membrane

Bath time: Moments later he appears with his head up as his mother gives him a gentle wash

His body gently flops to the ground, with his patchwork coat covered in membrane.

Moments later he appears with his head up as his mother gives him a gentle wash.

Unfortunately, he had a bit of trouble standing up and the video shows him writhing around on the muddy floor with his legs splayed out.

Eventually he is able to find his balance, thanks to assistance from zoo keepers.

Buttercup was Audrey's third baby in four years. 

The six-year-old mother gave birth on November 13 in an off-exhibit area at 1:45pm, just one hour and 45 minutes after labor was observed.

Commenting on the smooth delivery, zoo director Nancy McToldridge said: 'Our professional staff prepared for and implemented the plan for an easy and healthy birth.

'Everything went smoothly, even when Buttercup needed to be moved to a drier spot in order to stand up.'

The public got its first glimpse of Buttercup this week as he began exploring the giraffe exhibit under the watchful eye of his mother.
