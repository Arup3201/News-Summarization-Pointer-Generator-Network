A man with Down's syndrome was moved to tears after receiving 30,000 birthday cards from strangers around the globe after his mother's touching appeal on Facebook went viral.

Manuel Parriseaux, from Calais, France, was overwhelmed by well-wishers when he turned 30 on Saturday, following his  mother Jacqueline's post.

The doting mother, 61, wrote the message in French on her husband Lucien's page, but had no idea it would reach so many people.

'I would like to make a request to all my Facebook friends - my son Manuel is turning 30 years old on 22 November and he loves to receive cards in the post,' said the message.

'He has Down's syndrome. I'm writing to ask you to take a couple minutes to send him a little card and to pass this information on to your friends so the chain doesn't get broken.

'I thank you all in advance for your gesture, which will make my Manu so happy.'

The message struck a chord with Jacqueline and Lucien's friends and many more. Eventually the post was shared 120,00 times resulting in 300 birthday cards flooding in for Manuel. 

But the post was mistaken for spam by Facebook and the page was blocked.

Not easily deterred, Jacqueline then took to her own Facebook page to continue her appeal.

Manuel was moved to tears after his mother's appeal inspired 30,000 people to write to him

'Some people think it's not true, that the message was a scam,' she wrote.

'But I can confirm that, no, this is a real chain of solidarity. I am his mother and I'd like to renew my appeal.

'I want to take this opportunity to thank all those who participated. To date we have already received over 300 postcards.'

The second post took the campaign to a new level and to date Manuel has received 30,000 cards.

The proud mother told Newsbeat on BBC Radio 1, 'We got cards from everywhere: Sri Lanka, Chicago, Hong Kong and sometimes with child's drawings.'

'I don't understand why it got so big. Manuel is like us, he is moved to tears.'
