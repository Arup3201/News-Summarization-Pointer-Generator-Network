A gang leader drove teenage thugs around in a stolen Audi searching for professional women out by themselves at night to mug, a court has heard.

Junior Cooper, 35, drove his teenage cohorts around central London as they searched for vulnerable women, before gang members grabbed their victims, choked them and stole their bags in three violent attacks last year.

Cooper was sentenced to nine years behind bars last month after he was found guilty of conspiracy to rob, while 19-year-old gang member Remy McLeod was jailed for eight years today.

Southwark Crown Court was told that the women were grabbed from behind by the attackers, before their bags were snatched.

One of them, pianist Susanne Suhonen suffered a broken finger and may never be able to play properly again.

The court heard how another woman, Jacqueline Hurst, had just parked her car near her home in Marylebone at 10.30pm on November 15, 2013 when she was attacked by the thugs.

One grabbed around the waist while another choked her with her own silk scarf.

She was knocked to the ground during the robbery and continues to suffer the psychological effects.

‘Before the attack I was a confident girl, happy, fun and totally unfazed by city living’, she said, in a victim impact statement read to the court.

‘Everything has changed and I am half the woman I used to be - at all times day or night I am looking behind myself.’

Ms Hurst said she now has to wait for her boyfriend to escort her from her car, and can only sit or stand with her back to a wall when out in public for fear of being grabbed from behind.

About half an hour after the attack on Ms Hurst, Sarah Lewishon was attacked as she walked from her car to her house in St John’s Wood, north London.

She too was grabbed round the neck as the gang snatched her bag and knocked her down.

As she refused to let go of her handbag she was dragged along the ground, and continues to suffer from severe neck pain, as well as being too afraid to go out at night unaccompanied.

Ms Suhonen was attacked by the gang 11 days later, on November 26 last year, as she walked home.

Her finger, which was fractured when her bag and jewellery were snatched, has healed crooked, meaning she may never be able to play the piano properly again.

She told the court she was unable to sleep for about two weeks after the attack, and that she kept having nightmares.

‘I had to open my eyes and I didn’t want to close them for fear of seeing the same scenes again - needless to say I was exhausted in my domestic life and at work,' she said in her statement.

Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, told the court: 'She fractured her finger on her right hand, which healed crooked, due to the fracture and the way the position of the tendon, she is unable to have it straightened.

'She might not be able to play the piano properly with that hand again. Her wrist was inflamed and extremely painful. She had to postpone her piano exam for one year because of her injuries.'

Cooper, of Queens Park, north west London, and McLeod, of no fixed address, were both convicted of conspiracy to rob after a trial.

Cooper, who was jailed in 2009 for a spate of robberies, was sentenced to nine years in prison at a separate hearing last month. 

McLeod appeared relaxed in the dock and grinned as Judge Michael Grieve sentenced him to eight years detention. The licence period was extended by three years for the protection of the public.

He was also sentenced to six months for possession of a knife, which will be served concurrently.
