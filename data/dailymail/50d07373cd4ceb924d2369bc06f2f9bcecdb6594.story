A comedian managed to walk past armed police and film inside Tony Blair’s home as part of a new satirical BBC series.

Heydon Prowse posed as a decorator to gain entry to the former Prime Minister’s £4 million home in Central London.

Clutching
a stained glass window portraying Mr Blair as an angel the comedian 
tells a member of Mr Blair’s staff he ‘has come to deliver the stained 
glass window for Tony’.

Prank: Comedian Heydon Prowse approaches an armed policeman with the stained glass as he walks towards Mr Blair's front door in central London

Conned: He pretended to be a decorator when questioned by the police at the £4 million property

Fooled: After reaching the house Mr Blair's maid even fetched Prowse a ladder so that he could 'fit' the joke glass above the front door

Saintly: Prankster measures up the stained glass above Mr Blair's front door

The stunt was part of a spoof item in which Prowse 
asks people whether the ex-Labour leader should be granted sainthood for
‘bringing democracy to Iraq.'

It is during this period that Prowse secretly films inside the Georgian townhouse.

Later, with armed police looking on, Prowse takes the ladder outside and pretends to fit the glass over the door.

Spoof: Tony Blair (pictured) was said to have been unaware of the prank at his London home

After
explaining he needs a ladder to fit the window over Mr Blair’s front 
door, the maid invites him in while she looks for the equipment.

At one point, Mr Blair’s maid comes out and says: ‘It’s a bit small isn’t it?’

The footage will be shown on Wednesday evening in BBC3’s The Revolution Will Be Televised.

Last
night a spokeswoman for programme makers, Hat Trick Productions, said 
Mr Blair had not complained because he had not been aware it had taken 
place.

She
said that police had subsequently asked Prowse to identify himself and 
producers were called to confirm he had been ‘on BBC business’.

She added no laws had been broken because ‘he knocked on the door and the maid opened it and invited him in’.

But the prank will raise fears about the ease in which a terrorist could use a similar ruse.

More
than 20 officers are assigned to protect Mr Blair, at a cost of 
£115,000 a week.

Four armed police officers are stationed outside the 
house round-the-clock.

A spokesman for Mr Blair did not return calls.
