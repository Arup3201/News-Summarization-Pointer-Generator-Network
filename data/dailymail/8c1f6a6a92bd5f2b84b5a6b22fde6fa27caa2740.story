As Twitter turns 8, the firm today revealed a new site to reveal its users first tweets.

However, despite revealing the musings of everyone from President Obama to Kim Kardashian, it reveals they have on thing in common - our first tweets are, in general, terrible.

Twitter has even set up a special site so users can see what they tweeted first - and it has taken the social networking site by storm.

Winning Twitter: Katy Perry is the most popular star, with 51.3 million followers. Her first tweet was revealed as: 'Just got into Berlin... feeling better thank you, have my vicks inhaler by my bedside... and P.S. I GOT TWITTTTER! GAH. Such a follower!'

Twitter has set up a special site, first-tweets.com to reveal the first tweets of its users.

Using this tool, you can look back to find your very first Tweet — or for that matter, anyone else’s.

Just type in the @username, be it yours or your, favourite comedian, footballer or TV idol.

They range from the 'just setting up my twttr' message sent by founder Jack Dorsey on March 1st, 2006, and the the first tweet ever send, to Kim Kardashian's pleas for help in setting up her account

Oprah Winfrey, sending a tweet live on her show, said: 'HI TWITTERS . THANK YOU FOR A WARM WELCOME. FEELING REALLY 21st CENTURY.'

Comedian Russell Brand tweeted: 'i have come to join you pleas be gentle with me as ive been feeling vulnerable... yet implausibly, sexy'

Announcing the project to reveal first tweets, Twitter said: 'We’re also giving you the chance to discover the #FirstTweet that started your own Twitter journey — be it a selfie photo, a philosophical quote, a link, a reply, retweet or just a few words.'

The firm also spoke to David Levin, a professional tweeter for TV shows and production companies, on the stress of a first tweet.

'At first I was afraid; I was petrified,' he said.

The first tweet: Jack Dorsey showed even twitter's founders don't set the world alight at their first attempt

Pope Francis joined in March 2013, taking over the account set up by the previous pope

UK Prime Minister David Cameron and US president Barack Obama are both prominent on Twitter, and the site has been used to make major announcements - including that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s engagement in 2010.

The very first tweet was sent by the site’s founder, Jack Dorsey, and read “just setting up my twttr”. Since then more than 300 billion tweets have been sent, with more than 500 million currently being sent each day.

The success of Twitter saw the company launch a companion video service in 2013, with the release of Vine - an app that allows users to post six-second videos to the web.

Lindsey Vonn's first tweet - it is not known if she's now less skeptical by the service having gained 311,000 followers.

The men who made Twitter: (L - R) Twitter chief executive officer (CEO) Dick Costolo, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, Twitter co-founder Evan Williams and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone

'Why would anyone care what I have to say? What if I’ve only got two followers and one of them is my dad? What if I get in an argument with Piers Morgan? But still, I did it. I tweeted. I sent my first tweet. And like David Cameron, Jeremy Clarkson, Fearne Cotton and almost everybody except Stephen Fry - my first tweet didn’t exactly set the world alight.

'But with time, they became less rubbish. 

Miley Cyrus began her Twitter life with a formal message

Britney spears boasted her entourage was also on the service with her first tweet

Rihanna joined the service in 2009, much to the relief of her fans.

'And now, as someone who tweets for a living, looking back at my first tweet is looking at a moment that my life changed.

'Like my first day at school, but with more wine and crying.'

The #FirstTweet was today taking twitter by storm as the site prepares for its eighth anniversary tomorrow.
