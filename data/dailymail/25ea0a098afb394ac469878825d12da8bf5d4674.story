The Obama administration's chief spokesman confirmed on Friday that the United States is officially 'at war' with the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS, also called ISIL), the terror group that has become America's top military and foreign affairs priority.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday during his daily press briefing that the battle against ISIS now mirrors the ongoing War on Terror closely enough to use the 'W' word.

'The fact is ISIL has indicated that they're ready to go to war against the world,' Earnest said, 'and this president – as is expected of American presidents – is stepping up to lead an international coalition to confront that threat and to deny ISIL a safe haven. And ultimately this international coalition will be responsible for degrading and destroying ISIL.' 

'So I think what you could conclude from this is the United States is at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates all around the globe.'

Earlier in the day, Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby raised eyebrows with a saber-rattling declaration that 'make no mistake, we know we are at war with ISIL, in the same way we are at war, and continue to be at war, with al-Qaeda and its affiliates.'

But as recently as Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry insisted that it would be wrong to label U.S. counter-terror efforts against the Islamist terror group as waging war.

'What we are doing is engaging in a very significant counter-terrorism operation,' Kerry told CNN just a day ago.

'It's going to go on for some period of time. If somebody wants to think about it as being a war with ISIL, they can do so, but the fact is it's a major counter-terrorism operation that will have many different moving parts.'

The U.S. effort, he said, will involve 'many different things that one doesn't think of normally in context of war.' 

Separately, Kerry told CBS News on Thursday that 'I don't think people need to get into war fever on this. I think they have to view it as a heightened level of counter terrorist activity.' 

A senior State Department official told the Fox News Channel that Friday's turnabout 'was a deliberate, administration-wide adjustment in language, which Secretary Kerry would have also used today had he been asked.'

That uniformity of language was underscored an hour after Earnest spoke, when State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf briefed reporters.

Not a war? Secretary of State John Kerry was in Turkey on Thursday to try to persuade President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to support a US-led coalition in the fight against ISIS

Asked about Adm. Kirby's statement, she conceded that 'there's been a lot of questions about what words we use.'

Then, reading from a binder of prepared talking points, she announced: 'We are at war with ISIL in the same way that we are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates around the world.'

'To be clear about what that looks like,' she said, 'it will be a counter-terrorism campaign to take ISIL out using a broad set of tools.'

Harf insisted that 'this is not the kind of Iraq war that we had talked about in the recent past.'

On Friday the administration seemed to execute a complete 180-degree turn as its efforts to recruit foreign nations into a new collaboration reached a fever pitch.

Retired Marine Lieutenant General John Allen has been tapped to spearhead the coalition, and will report to Kerry.

ISIS fighters now number as many as 31,000, according to the CIA, including some freed from prisons by ISIS, and Sunni loyalists who have joined the fight as the group advanced across Iraq

Only Congress has the authority to declare war. It's unclear if the administration consulted with the Speaker of the House or the Senate Majority Leader before publicly changing course. 

President Obama's national security adviser, the much-maligned Susan Rice, also told CNN on Thursday that America's military action in Iraq and Syria 'will not' involve 'American combat forces on the ground fighting as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.'

That, she said, 'is what I think the American people think of when they think of a war. So I think this is very different from that.'

The question over whether or not the Obama administration was on war footing has contributed for weeks to confusion about U.S. operations in the Middle East.

Obama has personally taken flak from members of Congress and the media for failing to foresee that Iraq would descend into sectarian chaos after he pulled American troops out of the country at the end of 2011 without leaving a residual force behind.
