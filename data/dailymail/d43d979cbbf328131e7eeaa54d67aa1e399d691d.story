Lord Bichard said older people had to stop being a 'negative burden on the state'

The elderly should earn their pensions by doing voluntary work in their communities to avoid being a ‘burden on the state’, a retired mandarin  has suggested.

Lord Bichard, formerly head of the Benefits Agency, made the controversial suggestion at a House of Lords discussion on how to meet the costs of Britain’s ageing population.

Last night his plans were branded ‘National Service for the over-60s’ by angry pensioner groups.

The cross-bench peer, a former permanent secretary at the Department for Education, retired from the civil service at just 53.

His taxpayer-funded pension is estimated to be £120,000 a year.

Lord Bichard, 65, drew a parallel between the workshy claiming unemployment benefits and retirees drawing their pensions.

He said: ‘We are now prepared to say to people who are not looking for work, if you don’t look for work you don’t get benefits.

So if you are old and you are not contributing in some way or another, maybe there is some penalty attached to that.’

He called for ‘imaginative’ ideas such as making old people care for the very old.

Lord Bichard added: ‘Are we using all of the incentives at our disposal to encourage older people not just to be a negative burden on the state but actually be a positive part of society?

‘It is quite possible, for example, to envisage a world where civil  society is making a greater contribution to the care of the very old, and older people who are not very old could be making a useful contribution to civil society in that respect, if they were given some incentive or some recognition for doing so.’

He later pledged to investigate the idea further as part of his work for the Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change.

Lord Bichard, who led the inquiry into the Soham murders, said it would be difficult for politicians to sell to the public, but added: ‘So was tuition fees.’

Pensioner groups reacted with fury at the suggestion that the elderly should have to ‘earn’ their pension after a lifetime of working and contributing taxes.

Lord Bichard wants a system where civil society is making a 'greater contribution to the care of the very old'

Dot Gibson, general secretary of the 
National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘This amounts to little more than 
National Service for the over-60s and is absolutely outrageous.

‘Those who have paid their national 
insurance contributions for 30 or more years are entitled to receive 
their state pension and there should be no attempt to put further 
barriers in their way.

‘We already have one of the lowest state pensions in Europe and one in five older people in Britain live below the poverty line.

‘Lord Bichard’s comments are also 
extremely divisive – trying to pitch younger people against older people
 – when the truth is that the real division in our society is between 
rich and poor.

The general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention said nothing should be put in the way of retirees receiving their pension

Frankly, Lord Bichard needs to think twice before making such silly and ill-informed remarks.’

Michelle Mitchell, director general of the charity Age UK, said: ‘Older people are a hugely positive part of society.

‘Over a third of people aged between 
65 and 74 volunteer, a percentage that only drops slightly for the 
over-75s.

In addition, nearly a million older people provide unpaid care
 to family or friends, saving the state millions of pounds.’

Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, added: ‘This is a very strange idea indeed.

‘Those who have retired have already 
made huge contributions to our society and are already the largest group
 of charity and community volunteers.

‘Lord Bichard’s suggestion smacks of 
social engineering of a dangerous kind. He seems to be suggesting that 
if you decide to stop working, even once you reach the age that society 
determines it is reasonable to stop, civil servants should assess you 
and decide whether you are fit to be assigned to do work that they 
decide you should do.’

Professor James Sefton, of Imperial College, London, a former adviser to the Treasury, appeared to back Lord Bichard.

He told the committee he could not 
understand why young people were not taking to the streets  in protest, 
because they were subsidising the older generation.

He told peers: ‘I think they  should be angry.

‘I think the deal they are getting is poor.’

Lord Sefton, who is also an analyst at
 the Swiss-owned UBS bank, said research he was carrying out at Imperial
 College, suggested that ‘the current generation are very heavy 
contributors to the public purse, whereas previous generations have 
benefited from the public purse’.
