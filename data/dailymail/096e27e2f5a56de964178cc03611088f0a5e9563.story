Louis van Gaal is expected to be announced as Manchester United's new manager this week, but what are the salient points to take away from his appointment?

Sportsmail's Martha Kelner has been over in Holland this week and talks through five things we are set to learn about the Dutch head coach.

Looking ahead: Louis van Gaal is ready to be announced as the new Manchester United manager this week

Press conferences are unlikely to be boring

Louis Van Gaal press conferences are punctuated by extended periods of silence where he stares down his inquisitor, seemingly attempting to unnerve with his steely gaze.

At Saturday’s press conference, one Dutch journalist idly asked Van Gaal how he would be spending his two-day break from Holland’s pre-World Cup training camp. ‘I don’t ask you how you are spending your weekend, so why should I tell you?’ the manager snapped back.

‘He always feels like he’s being attacked,’ one Dutch football journalist remarked, ‘so he is constantly on the defensive. He lacks the personal skills of someone like Ruud Gullit. But you’re in for an entertaining season.’

Van Gaal has a stern manner and according to one Dutch journalist who has been reporting on football in the Netherlands for 30 years, his brusqueness extends to his personal life. ‘He has two grown up daughters,’ the journalist said, ‘and they still address him very formally. There is no casual conversation with Louis.’

Talent: United hotshot James Wilson could be handed a chance under the new boss next season

Youngsters will get their chance

As a former PE teacher, Van Gaal is well-versed in handling young people, although one imagines he was probably the strictest teacher at his school.

On Saturday he gave starts to three of the youngest members of his World Cup squad. Van Gaal selected Terence Kongolo, Feyenoord’s 20-year-old defender, to take to Brazil despite him being previously uncapped. PSV Eindhoven’s Memphis Depay, 20, also started and both sparkled at times.

Jordy Clasie, Feyenoord’s highly rated 22-year-old playmaker played the superb pass that led to Robin Van Persie’s equaliser. Van Gaal’s trust in youth will come as welcome news to United’s thrusting youngsters, including 18-year-old James Wilson who scored twice on his debut in the 3-1 defeat of Hull City earlier this month. 

Robin Van Persie will be a Van Gaal favourite

It is obvious simply from observing the way they interact that there is a lot of respect, even warmth, between the pair. Van Persie was among the first to shake Van Gaal’s hand after the final whistle. It was also notable that Van Gaal - who usually refrains from mentioning individual players for plaudits or criticism - singled Van Persie out for praise in the post match press conference.

The striker is already very highly regarded by Van Gaal but his exquisitely taken goal to level proceedings at the Amsterdam ArenA will have only enhanced his reputation with the manager. Van Persie will feature prominently in Van Gaal’s plans at Old Trafford. ‘It has been a tough year,’ said Van Persie beforehand.

‘For the first time in my career I won’t be playing in Europe.’ Van Gaal will aim to soften that blow by aiming for the top four or higher next season.

Partnership: Robin van Persie shares a special bond with Van Gaal and will be handed major responsibility

He’ll probably be able to devote himself to United sooner than he’d like

Holland have an even tougher ask than England to get to the latter stages of the World Cup after being drawn in the ‘group of death’ with Spain, Chile and Australia. If they come second in the group, they will probably face Brazil on their home soil.

They were missing star names Nigel de Jong, Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart and Arjen Robben on Saturday night but judging by the lacklustre performance in their absence, a meeting with the hosts would be one step too far. Van Gaal could find himself swapping the sun, sea and sand of Brazil for the charms of Manchester sooner than he would like.

Dugout demeanour

Van Gaal is not one for patrolling the technical area. He has no obvious affectations, no Fergie-style gum chewing or AVB crouching. But his special notebook was ever-present. ‘I always have it with me in the dug-out and it attracts a lot of remarks,’ Van Gaal has said.

‘For me, it’s an extremely valuable aid, so it’s not important what other people think. First I always jot down the collective mistakes that go against the pre-planned tactics. That’s the most important aspect. Next, I always note down individual mistakes, of course.

'This way I have a logical sequence of aspects about which I can talk to the players during the interval. That’s why I find a list so useful. The chance of forgetting something important is negligible.’

Distinctive: Van Gaal doesn't have a dugout trademark like Andre Villas-Boas but still makes himself heard
