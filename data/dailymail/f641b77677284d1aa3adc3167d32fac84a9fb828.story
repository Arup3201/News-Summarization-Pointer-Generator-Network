This relaxed bear took some time out to catch a bit of autumn sunshine by floating on his back in a pond.

With his legs akimbo and toes pointing to the sky, the European brown bear lazed in the water for half an hour.

Almost as if he was in his own bathtub, the huge animal casually checked his surroundings as he daydreamed.

Taking it easy: A relaxed bear takes some time out to catch a bit of autumn sunshine at the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany

Shallow waters: The eight-year-old was in a pond in the brown bear compound

The hilarious shots were taken by nature photographer Duncan Usher in Eastern Bavaria, Germany.

The
eight-year-old bear is a resident at the Bavarian Forest National Park,
and was spotted in a pond in the brown bear compound.

Mr
Usher, 57, from Bursfelde, Lower Saxony, Germany, said: 'I visited the 
park to actually try and photograph two newborn cubs playing. But they were nowhere to be seen when I turned up.

'Instead, I found this huge brown bear laid out in the water at full stretch - it looked so human-like.

'The
bear really was enjoying the water and was constantly trying to find 
the most comfortable spot, grunting and snorting - apparently fully 
relaxed.

'When he finally got out of the water he ambled off into the bushes and disappeared out of sight - probably for another snooze.'

At ease: The bear rolls over as he enjoys his long soak

Wet and not so wild: The grizzly appeared in no rush to get out of the pond

Before taking up the relaxing position, the bear had been slouching against nearby trees, apparently not in an energetic mood.

Mr Usher, who is originally from Allendale, Northumberland, added: 'These shots were very special for me. Although I had photographed this bear several times before, I have never witnessed any behaviour like this.

'He stared straight at me several times too, as if to say "Hey, can't you give a guy some privacy whilst he is in his bathtub!"'

Itch alert: The slothful bear does manage to scratch his head though
