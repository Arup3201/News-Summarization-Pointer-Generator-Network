Fears are growing for a British teenager who has gone missing while kayaking along a swollen river in Norway.

Jason Raper, 19, of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, was attending an extreme sports festival at Voss, in Hordaland, but went missing along the River Raundalen at 6.30pm on Saturday.

A search was called off on Monday morning but local police are still monitoring bridges along the river in the hope of finding him.

Mr Raper has been an enthusiastic kayaker since discovering the sport on a course when he was 13 and is a committee member of Scarborough and District Canoe Club.

Club spokesman Martin Stirling said the teenager had travelled to Norway after visiting the Alps. 

He added: 'They had a lot of hot weather and the rivers were extremely high. Mr Raper went down a stretch of the river and disappeared. 

'They finished the main body of the search on Monday morning.'

Mr Stirling said that the search had involved helicopters and dog teams.

'There is always a slim hope,' he said.

Earlier this year Mr Raper, who is a joiner, raised around £6,000 for the Great North Air Ambulance after a three-day kayak trip in memory of his friend Kate Stainsby, who died during a canoe trip in Cumbria on New Year's Day.

A Foreign and Commonwealth spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a British national has gone missing while kayaking in Norway and we are providing consular assistance to the family.'
