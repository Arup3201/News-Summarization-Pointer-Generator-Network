The new Porsche Design P'9983 Graphite smartphone from BlackBerry boasts a hand wrapped leather battery case, 'glass-like' keys and even a personalised PIN so everyone know you own one.

Pioneered in 1999 with the launch of the RIM 950, BlackBerry changed the culture by allowing on-the-go business people to access email wirelessly. 

Then came a new generation of competing smartphones, and suddenly the BlackBerry looked ancient. 

Apple showed that phones can handle much more than email and phone calls. Blackberry was late in overhauling its operating system to compete.

BlackBerry now holds a small fraction of the U.S. smartphone market after commanding a nearly 50 percent share as recently as 2009. 

'This new member to the P'9983 family will provide exclusive graphite-metallic colored elements and the finest, hand-wrapped leather on the back door cover,' the firm boasts.

'This new Porsche Design P'9983 Graphite smartphone from BlackBerry will combine a unique stylish design from an iconic, timeless brand with the fluid and effortless productivity experience of BlackBerry 10 technology.'

Porsche Design worked with BlackBerry to design the keyboard to use glass-like keys, blackened glass and a graphite stainless steel color frame. 

'The iconic styling of the new P'9983 Graphite from BlackBerry is technically inspired with longevity, integrity, and individuality at its core,' says Roland Heiler, Chief Design Officer of the Porsche Design Group. 'And it will offer a new way to express individual style with the luxury of being one step ahead.' 

'Finally, an exclusive Porsche Design PIN ID group - 2AAXXXXX, sets you apart and makes you instantly recognized among other Porsche Design users.'

The firm also hopes a physical keyboard will help sales. 

The physical keyboard is something traditional BlackBerry users prefer because they find it easier than touch screens to type with. 

The company is also emphasizing battery life and security.

'A lot of people say the Classic is aiming for loyal customers. And that is true,' CEO John Chen said at the gadget's launch event, tellingly held in New York City's Financial District. 

But he also invited people who haven't used a BlackBerry 'especially people who are young,' to try the BlackBerry Classic.

The handsets have a legion of loyal fans.  

'I love a BlackBerry,' Kardashian West admitted to the Code Mobile conference earlier this year. 

'Every time I say that, people are horrified that I have a BlackBerry, and I don't understand that reaction.' 

'BlackBerry has my heart and soul, I'll never get rid of it,' she said.

 'I do have an iPhone, and I use that for photos, but if you have an email and you need to type fast, you need to have that keyboard.' 

The BlackBerry Classic iwas released earlier this year, bringing back the keyboard to Blackberrys handsets.
