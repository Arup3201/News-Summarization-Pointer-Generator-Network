Despite costing thousands of pounds, pectoral implants are becoming increasingly popular among men desperate to boost their upper bodies without hitting the gym.

But swapping sinew for silicone can have disastrous consequences as 44-year-old hairdresser, Brett, knows only too well.

Four years ago, the Australian got implants to boost his confidence after his marriage ended, only to be left in excruciating pain after developing an aggressive infection in one.

Painful: Hairdresser Brett was left with a lopsided chest after one of his pec implants became badly infected

Embarrassing: Brett says the experience left him feeling like a freak

Worse, when the implant was removed, it left him with a disfigured chest that appeared totally lopsided.

Speaking about the havoc wrought on his body, Brett, who appears in TLC documentary Extreme Beauty Blunders, said: 'In a way, it looks like I have two different bodies joined together. 

'There's no other word than freaky, or feeling like a freak that something's gone wrong with you. What I feel is that it's holding me back, that I was stupid to have the surgery done in the first place when there was really nothing wrong with my body to start with.'

In the years since the operation, the hairdresser has been forced to hide his chest in baggy clothing and says his lopsided chest has had a dramatic effect on his confidence.

'I dreamed of being a bit more buff and had the chest implants for a quick lift to my body and self-esteem,' he explains.

'I thought I would feel so good about myself... that would be the dream come true but it's not come true.

'The pain that I experienced with the swelling and the implant was horrific. My biggest fear is that I can't be helped. I just want my symmetry back.'

According to Dr Vik Vijh, a cosmetic surgeon who specialises in repairing botched surgery, pectoral implants are a particularly risky procedure.

'The female breast implant is soft, so 
when it pushes against the tissue, it gives way,' he explains. 'A pec implant is solid.
 When it pushes against the tissues, the tissues give way - Brett could end up with a moob.'

Warning: Leading cosmetic surgeon Dr Roberto Viel says that chest implants are always a bad idea

And he's not the only surgeon to warn of the potentially damaging effects of chest implants. Dr Massimiliano Marcellino of the London Center of Aesthetic Surgery says that choosing the right doctor is key as badly inserted pec implants can lead to serious consequences.

'Brett's case sounds extremely worrying,' he says, adding: 'It is very important that you 
choose a reputable surgeon to gain the desired effect with the right 
experience.'

Colleague Dr Roberto Viel is also wary of pec implants, which unlike the version created for breasts, are relatively solid - and hard to remove.

'We strongly discourage our patients to undergo pec implants, the risk of reaction (capsular contraction) and dislocation are too high plus those implants do look fake.

'Men with big chests are not seen as particularly trendy and they have difficulties in dressing suits and shirts.

'If we do need to augment male chest we use submuscular  lipofilling (fat injection) which it looks rather more natural and it is very safe.

'There 
are so many options and all are subject to body proportions and what 
will benefit the individual best - this is why you need to always talk to
 an expert where cosmetic surgery is concerned.'

For Brett, there's no choice and the only option left is to have his second pec implant removed.

'I'm looking forward to going to the gym and building up some muscle,' he adds. 'Hopefully, I'll one day have a normal looking chest again.'
