A 17-year-old skier who went missing on Sunday was found unharmed this morning after he built a snow cave with skills he learned on popular TV survival shows.

Nicholas Joy, of Medford, Massachusetts, was skiing with his father, Robert, on Sugarloaf Mountain on Sunday afternoon when he got lost.

His desperate family feared the worst after his second night on the mountain last night but were delighted when a snow-mobiler discovered the teen stumbling to safety this morning. 

Found: Rescuers took this photograph just moments after Nicholas Joy was found 'in great shape' after spending two nights lost in freezing conditions on Sugarloaf Mountain, Maine

In a statement this afternoon, Robert and Donna Joy said: 'There is great relief and happiness that Nicholas has made it through this difficult ordeal.'

'We want to thank everyone for their 
hopes and prayers and especially members of the rescue team'.

Nicholas became lost when he tried to find his way back after skiing off trail on Sunday.

He built a snow cave, covered himself with branches to keep warm and survived on water from a nearby stream in skills learned from his love of outdoors survival programs.

His enthusiasm for the shows like the popular Man vs Wild hosted by Bear Grylls, meant he survived without injury and was able to walk from the woods to be spotted this morning.

According to PracticalSurvivor.com picking a good location is key. It should aim to protect you from the wind and avoid possibly perilous spots such as a riverbank

If you're a skier you should use your skies to help you gather a huge pile of snow - around five foot high or more. You should then pat it down and leave it to settle before you hollow out a cave 

The cave should be several feet deep sloping slightly up. Pine boughs should be placed at the base for added insulation and to stop the body being in contact with the snow

The ceiling is then carved into a dome shape

The site recommends a wall thickness of 12+ inches with a ventilation hole

General manager of Sugarloaf Mountain John Diller was with the family when they heard the news.

'We were ecstatic. I was with his parents about a minute after they found him. I cried along with them,' he told the Boston Herald.

'This kind of thing, it’s almost like a miracle.’

Snowmobiler Joseph Paul happened upon
the high school senior four miles away from the resort around 9am today
as he rode on Caribou Pond Road.

He gave the hungry teen cheese crackers and peanuts before taking him in to be reunited with his parents.

He was later filmed by a local broadcaster walking to a waiting ambulance.

'I was searching off the side of the trail looking for any footprints or sign of anybody,' he told WHDH.

'All of the sudden I see some footprints walking down the trail. So he 
had found the snowmobile trail finally and I just gave him a ride out.

'He said he went off, following the 
trail and it ended skiing and then he started hiking back up. He decided
he was going to take a shortcut and then he got lost.'

'He said he watched a survival show and made a shelter with branches and drank out of the stream, so that’s how he survived'.

The experienced skier was supposed to meet him at the bottom of the mountain just before 1pm on Sunday.

Robert Joy raised the alarm when his son, a Medford High School student, failed to arrive.

Dozens joined the warden service in trying to find the teen including Navy SEALs but it was called off on Monday due to high winds and blowing snow

Nicholas was taken in to Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, Maine, but is believed to be without injury, not even suffering frostbite

One thing is for sure - the teenager is hungry.

His mother emerged this afternoon to buy him a cheeseburger and fries saying: 'He hasn't eaten for two days'.
