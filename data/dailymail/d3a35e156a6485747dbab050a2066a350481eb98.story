On the roster: Ronan Farrow, 26, has been assigned the 1pm time slot on MSNBC

MSNBC has given Ronan Farrow a time slot for his new show which will start late next month.

The 26-year-old's yet-untitled show will take the 1pm time slot on the cable news network and will premiere on February 24.

Farrow is Mia Farrow's son and a former foreign policy official in the Obama administration.

The announcement about his program is just one in a series of moves that the network is making as it shuffles its daytime schedule.

Farrow will be followed by a new show at 2pm with Joy Reid, managing editor of The Grio.com.

Current shows hosted by Tamron Hall and Andrea Mitchell will air at 11am and noon respectively.

The daytime openings were created by the move of Thomas Roberts to the early slot before 'Morning Joe' and the exit of Martin Bashir following crude comments he made about Sarah Palin.

Alex Wagner moved her show from noon to 4pm in the wake of Bashir's exit, and she'll keep that schedule.

Following weeks of speculation, Bashir released a statement at the beginning of December explaining his decision to resign over the 'ill-judged' comments about the former Alaskan governor's comparison of the federal debt to slavery.

He previously apologized to Palin both on and off camera, but came under further fire when fellow MSNBC host Alec Baldwin was fired for making homophobic comments to journalists outside of his apartment while he was not formally reprimanded in any way until now.

Starting early: Farrow has previously worked as a special adviser to Hillary Clinton when she was the Secretary of State (pictured here in 2011) and also held the title of global youth ambassador for the United Nations

MSNBC is known for their left-leaning political allegiances, and Farrow adds another connection to the Democratic party to their channel's roster.

Farrow previously held the title of 
UNICEF spokesman advocating for youth issues and later was appointed as a
 special advisor to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2011.

Alex Wagner, whose show will immediately precede Farrow's, is engaged to the White House chef, Sam Kass.

The couple have kept their relationship purposefully quiet but were dating for about a year before eagle-eyed viewers began noticing that Wagner was wearing an engagement ring on a very precarious finger in October.

No details about Farrow's contract 
with MSNBC have been released, so his salary remains a secret, but he 
clearly plans to be around for a while as he just bought a $1.495million
 condo near Lincoln Center in Manhattan.

The New York Post reported that Farrow bought the two
 bedroom, two bathroom apartment in a building that allows the owner 
access to a communal roof deck that looks out at the Hudson River on one
 side and Central Park on the other.

According to Zillow, 15th floor apartment has skyline views visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows that keeps the apartment flooded with natural light.

The apartment is has an easy commute to MSNBC's studios in Rockefeller Center, and it seems fitting that it should be on the city's West side as that is where his mother has always lived.Â
