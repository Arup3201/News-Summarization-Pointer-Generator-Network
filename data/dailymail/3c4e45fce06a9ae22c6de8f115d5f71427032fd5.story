A drunk tractor driver decapitated three people after swerving across the road and crushing a people carrier.

Jacob Gavrilov, 43, was five times over the limit, with no lights on, when his vehicle swung to the left and ploughed head-on into another, police said.

Joseph Zhdanov, 32, his wife Maria, 28, and a friend all died instantly in the crash in rural Irkutsk Oblast, southern Russia.

The force of the late-night collision knocked off the front wheels of the tractor and sent the car underneath the body of the vehicle, crushing the roof and decapitating the group inside.

Gavrilov, who was unharmed, ran from the scene but was tracked down and arrested within hours.

Police spokesman Andrew Ankudinov said: 'The tractor's scoop hit the car and shaved off the top killing those inside instantly.

'They didn't have a chance.

'But they didn't even see the tractor coming as it was dark and it didn't have any lights on.

'After the accident the tractor driver who was unhurt ran off but we were able to follow his footprints in the snow and he was arrested.

'He was still over the limit.'
