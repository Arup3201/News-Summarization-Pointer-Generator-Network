Google's Kevin Rose has built a career out of cutting-edge technology but plans to bring his historic Oregon home into the 21st Century have not been welcomed.

Rose, who founded news site Digg before joining Google, paid $1.3 million for the spacious 1890s house in Portland.

But when he revealed plans to demolish the five-bedroom house and build a new one on the site, neighbors started a petition to try to save the property.

Digg founder Kevin Rose has decided not to go ahead with plans to bulldoze his historic Oregon home after his neighbors' protest sparked a last-minute change of heart

Rose, who founded the news site Digg before joining Google, paid $1.3 million for the spacious 1890s house in Portland

The house, which was built in 1892, has been described as one of the 'great icons of Northwest Portland'.

On Monday however, a permit was issued to tear the property down after Rose had it removed from an historic homes inventory.

Steve Wilson, who was one of the agents who listed the property, said he knew Rose and his wife Darya planned a remodel, but said he was shocked to hear it was going to be pulled down.

'We did expect him to do a substantial remodel, but you pay $1.3 million and tear a house down? In Portland? That doesn't happen in,' he told the Oregonian.

An online petition set up by the couple's new neighbors has attracted more than 1,100 signatures since being set live.

In an open letter addressed to Rose and his wife, the petition states: 'When several of us met you at this yearâ€™s Easter egg hunt, we were eager to find out about your plans.

'We were reassured that you had no plans to build on the spare lot, and were relieved to hear that you were committed to remodeling rather than demolishing the house.'

It added that the neighbors had been shocked to later hear that the property had been removed from Portland's landmark inventory and was set to be demolished.

Rose has responded to the petition, releasing a statement that claimed the couple had been left no choice after receiving a quote for remodeling that was more than the house price.

Despite having surveys done before agreeing to buy the house, the couple later discovered extensive repairs were needed.

Rose said that they have asked the previous owner to buy back the house and fix the asbestos and other issues with it, and said if the demolition went ahead the materials would be recycled.

Unlisted: Kevin Rose had the house removed from a list of potentially significant properties

'We never intended to deceive anyone, as some of you have accused. We simply wanted to create a beautiful home for our family,' Rose said.

He added that the house had been listed as potentially significant on a voluntary register, but when an independent architect inspected it, they assured the couple it was not historically important.

Rose said the couple had hoped to just carry out an extensive remodel but 'the costs were higher than we anticipated, and we knew we could never recoup that kind of money on a 100 year-old house'.

Jim Draudt and Ann Witsil, who the Roses bought the house from, have also backed the petition to save the property, issuing a statement praising neighbors for raising concerns about the demolition.

'The only solution acceptable to us is to save the house, not to remove it,' the couple wrote.
