China has unveiled its latest method of crowd control - a ray gun likened to a 'human microwave' which gives its target the excruciating sensation of feeling like they're on fire.

Operating on similar principles to a microwave, the Poly WB-1 projects a wave beam up to a range of 80metres that causes movement in water and fat molecules just below the skin.

Despite the extreme burning pain felt by those shot, the weapon is completely non-lethal, leaves no lasting damage and the pain subsides immediately when moved off the person.

The China Poly Group Corporation used a recent air show to reveal its new weapon, and claimed its range could be increased to up to a kilometre, IHS Jane's reported. 

It is remarkably similar to a weapon briefly deployed by the US military in Afghanistan in 2010 that was withdrawn after concerns it could be used against the US in a propaganda war.

However, the weapon - called the Active Denial System (ADS) - also required 16 hours to warm up before use.

The futuristic device has long been popular with authorities as a means of effective crowd control because of its ability to repel groups of people without leaving any visible marks or injuries.

It was described in  Harper's Magazine as 'the next hurdle for non-lethality'.

Author Ando Arike wrote: 'Although “first-generation” weapons like rubber bullets and pepper spray have gained a certain acceptance, despite their many drawbacks, exotic technologies like the Active Denial System invariably cause public alarm.'
