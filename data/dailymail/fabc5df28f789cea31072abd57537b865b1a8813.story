The legs exciting the most intense fascination in Las Vegas this weekend do not belong to the tallest show-girl or the sexiest lap dancer on the famous Strip.

It is the muscular under-carriage of the wealthiest athlete in town which is attracting the closest attention.

It is the legs which weaken first when even the greatest of boxers reach a certain age. Not the punching power. Not even the reflexes.

Marcos Maidana lands a punch on Floyd Mayweather during their first bout in May but lost the brutal fight

Floyd Mayweather is 37 now and there are many among the blood brotherhood of the prize-ring who believe they are detecting a tell-tale slowing of the dazzling footwork which has helped him bank hundreds of millions of dollars.

That speed of movement is as important a weapon in Mayweather’s formidable armoury as the lightning hand speed and he did not appear as quick across the canvas in his last fight.

On that night here, four months ago, this most elusive practitioner of the noble art of self defence found himself obliged to stand and trade hefty punches with Argentine slugger Marcos Maidana.

After being roughed up like never before, Mayweather now goes into a re-match with that same presumptuous opponent. And Senor Maidana returns emboldened yet further by how much physical hurt he has already been able to inflict on the world’s best pound-for-pound fighter.

That gut-wrenching effort, while not enough to prevent Mayweather’s hand rightly being raised at the end of 12 ferocious rounds, did create sufficient debate to justify them returning to Floyd’s Money pit a second time.

Mayweather is guaranteed a minimum $30 million, Maidana roughly a tenth of that.

The contentious American has explained away whatever problems he had in the first fight as a consequence of him ‘choosing to stand and fight so I could give all the fans the thrills they want.’

Er…maybe.

Boxers do not usually choose to be hit. The best of them withstand it heroically when it happens but they would rather be the ones doing the hitting.

True or not this left the impression that he is now obliged to trade punches at times, where once he used to sashay out of touching distance like mist in the night.

That in no way diminishes Mayweather’s stature as one of the finest ring-craftsmen of all time but it may indicate increased vulnerability as he approaches the end of his career.

This will the 47th fight on a so-far unblemished record and he repeats that there will be only two more, one in May and another in September next year.

The full-frontal assault he must expect from Maidana in the MGM Grand Arena will provide an indication of how likely he is to realise his cherished ambition of quitting as an undefeated world champion.

In all probability he would have retired into a life of luxury already had it not been for the Showtime television network presenting him with a six-fight contract worth at least $250 million and up to $300 million.

So far, three down and three to go.

Mayweather’s welter and light-middleweight titles are not the most valuable prizes on the line here. The Showtime must go on but for that goose it to keep laying its biggest eggs he has to keep winning.

If he can do so in a manner which convinces himself that his powers are not waning, then he may feel strong enough to reach out for the golden fleece itself – the $300 million super-fight against Manny Pacquiao for which the world still awaits.

That potential epic to finish, preceded by the promised clash with our own Amir Khan, would generate the maximum interest back home in Blighty.

Can those legs carry Mayweather through all these challenges?

If he wants to steer clear of danger against Maidana he will have to be at his most nimble. El Chino will go for the Money as hard as he can, once again.

Intriguingly, Mayweather claims he will make no technical adjustments so as to avoid being cut and bruised again. But then he can be as deceptive when discussing his approach to a big fight as he is clever in selling it to the pay-TV public.

Controversy has again contrived to grab world-wide interest. One former girl-friend is suing him for assault, while Mayweather has apologised for offering a qualified defence of a giant NFL footballer who was caught on film knocking out his wife in an elevator.

Then there is all the publicity about his bling-laden lifestyle.

But behind it all works a dedicated sportsman who trains himself to the limit, in absolute readiness for the moment when the hype has to stop, the fight begin.

The casino bookmakers here know that. So while he complains that his genius is under-appreciated, another Mayweather win is quoted at 2-15 on with Maidana at 5-1 against.

Both men say they will go for the knock-out ‘to make a statement.’ While a stoppage would appear to be Maidana’s only realistic chance of winning.

But if Mayweather has his dancing shoes back on I expect him to pirouette to victory on his own Las Vegas stage, with the help of a stricter referee to keep the challenger’s bull-rush tactics within the laws.

Sin City has been the ruination of many a great man. Thought probably not this Saturday night.

But next year? In one of what Mayweather insists will be his last two fights? We will have a better idea come the early hours of Sunday morning UK time.

Mayweather v Maidana will be live late this Saturday night on BoxNation.
