A veteran TV sportscaster has been fired after he offered best wishes to colleagues who were leaving the station while live on-air.

On two occasions, Joe Swift thanked his co-workers on KNOP-TV in North Platte, Nebraska earlier this month. 

Several days later, bosses called him in to say he was fired after he supposedly gave the impression that his friends were forced out of the company.

Joe Swift thanked his co-workers on air at KNOP-TV in Nebraska as they prepared to leave the company - he was fired several days later for his kind gesture

The sportscaster made no mention of how newscaster Tara Moore and production manager Dennis McConnell left. Both employees resigned,North Platte Bulletin reported. 

Mr Swift told viewers: 'If I may take a moment: Tomorrow the last day for two longtime employees at KNOP... I want to take this opportunity to wish the best to Tara and Dennis.'

Newscaster Tara Moore resigned from the station 

The kind-hearted remarks lost Mr Swift his sportscaster job at the station - where he was worked for two decades. 

There have been several changes in staffing at KNOP, which has provided news for the area for close to 70 years, since it was bought over a year ago.

KNOP now operates under parent company of Gray Television, based in Atlanta, Georgia. 

Despite his difficult week, Mr Swift remained optimistic, telling North Platte Bulletin: 'I got fired for being a nice guy. I can live with that.'

In his career at KNOP, Mr Swift has covered two Super Bowls and numerous Nebraska Cornhusker games, according to his profile on the company's website. 

It has since been removed along with his picture.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from KNOP-TV.

The newscaster informed viewers that two colleagues were leaving the station - a gesture for which he lost his job after 20 years
