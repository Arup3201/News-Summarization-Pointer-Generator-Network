Despite playing just 160 minutes of Premier League football so far this season, Chelsea striker Loic Remy already has as many goals as Liverpool's entire strikeforce.

Remy has had to settle for a supporting role for Jose Mourinho's side this season following Diego Costa's brilliant start to life in a Chelsea shirt, but that hasn't stopped the Frenchman from bagging two Premier League goals in his limited time on the pitch.

The former QPR striker, who has three goals to his name this season, was also forced to miss several games after picking up a groin injury during Chelsea's 6-0 win against Maribor in October.

Loic Remy: 2 in 160 minutes

Rickie Lambert: 1 in 445 minutes

Daniel Sturridge : 1 in 270 minutes

Fabio Borini: 0 in 156 minutes

Mario Balotelli: 0 in 685 minutes

Liverpool's strikeforce of Daniel Sturridge, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini have managed just two Premier League goals between them after a difficult start to the season.

£16million man Balotelli has endured a terrible start to life in a Liverpool shirt and is without a Premier League goal for his new club despite starting in eight of Liverpool's 14 games and playing 685 minutes.

Brendan Rodgers has sorely missed the presence of star striker Sturridge, who has been ruled out since September with a thigh injury and scored just once before getting injured.

Rickie Lambert has scored just one goal for Liverpool since joining in the summer

Lambert's chances have been limited, but the former Southampton frontman bagged his first goal for the Reds during the 3-1 defeat against Crystal Palace in November.

Remy, however, has scored three times in his nine appearances for the Blues this season and admits that he must keep it up.

He told ChelseaTV: 'For me it's really important to score and the opportunity was there because Diego [Costa] was not involved tonight and Didier played well again and it's important to increase the level and keep going in this direction.'
