West Ham manager Sam Allardyce insists Tottenham’s Harry Kane cannot be considered a great striker until he has proved himself for a second season.

Allardyce takes his side to Spurs on Sunday for their fierce London derby where he admits Kane will be the ‘danger man.’ Kane, 21, has shocked everyone by scoring 23 goals in 36 games in all competitions this season which has put him on the verge of an England call-up.

But Allardyce does not believe Spurs should get carried away with his performances until he has shown he can continue scoring when opponents are prepared for him.

‘He’s been so brilliant,’ Allardyce said, ‘but he’s not that well known in the Premier League. It’s similar to Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho at West Ham this season.Because they’re unknown they can surprise defenders. They’ve not been able to watch them play.

‘The test of time, if they will be great, is when everyone knows how they play if they can sustain it then. That will be the test for Kane.’ Allardyce is, however, under no illusions as to how much of a threat Kane will be in the match at White Hart Lane.

Kane was rested by manager Mauricio Pochettino in Tottenham’s Europa League draw with Fiorentina and only played a part from the bench.

‘He’s the danger man,’ Allardyce added. ‘He only came on as a substitute so I can see him starting on Sunday.

‘Kane is the reason Spurs have climbed the table. His goal threat is greater than any other front man Spurs have got on their books.’
