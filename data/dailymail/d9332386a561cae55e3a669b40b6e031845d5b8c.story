Mike Barham with 30-year-old musical Father Christmas that's still running on original batteries

A 30-year-old musical Father Christmas decoration miraculously still plays a tune despite its original batteries having never been changed.

The electronic Santa has been belting out a decreasingly accurate Jingle Bells since it was won on a raffle in a pub.

But its owner  Mike Barham, 32, appears to be the only one pleased by this fact, as his parents have repeatedly tried to hide the eight-inch figure from him.

Mr Barham, from Cannock, Staffordshire, was given the mini Father Christmas when he was two by his father Mick who won it in a pub raffle.

And amazingly Mike's never had to change the batteries, even though the current two 1980s 'D' Maxell Super Power Ace Red have rusted solid into position.

Mike, 32, who lives with Julie and their 15-month-old daughter Millie in Cannock, Staffs, is bringing out the decoration this year as he has for the past 29.

He said: 'My mum and my partner hate it, when I was a kid mum used to hide it in the cooker or the fridge. 'My partner says it's got fleas.

'It moved out of home with me about seven years ago and it's usually in a box in the garage, I get it out about a week before Christmas.

'It's incredible to think he's still going after 30 years. My dad Mick won him in a raffle at a pub and I've had him ever since.

'Santa hasn't got a nickname or anything like that and the tune he plays now is a bit difficult to understand, but in battery years he must be an OAP by now.'
