Casey Anthony tonight rejected a jailhouse visit from her mother as her parents tried to speak to her for the first time since she was acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee.

Cindy Anthony made an appointment to visit her 25-year-old daughter at Orange County jail, Florida, at 7pm but Anthony refused to see her.

Mrs Anthony was due to go to the prison - where her daughter must spend another nine days after being found guilty of lying to police - without her husband George Anthony.

Anthony’s refusal to speak to her mother is the latest sign of how estranged she is from her parents. The snub has led to speculation of where Anthony will go when she is freed next Sunday.

Jail spokesman Allen Moore said: 'This morning under policy, Casey was told of the visit and she has declined the visit so it will not occur.'

The snub came as it was revealed that Anthony will be only the second inmate in the past 15 years to not walk out the front door of the jail lobby when she is released from custody.

The jail admitted that it has planned a secret exit for her protection when she walks free on Sunday July 17.

The only other inmate who got such special handling was Noelle Bush, daughter of then-Governor Jeb Bush and niece of then-President George W Bush, who the Secret Service believed could be targeted by terrorists.

George and Cindy Anthony have not spoken to their daughter since before her sensational six-week trial, which has caused outrage across the country.

The family has been torn apart by accusations of incest, rape and adultery.

Casey's parents George and Cindy, who have been married for 30 years, publicly supported their daughter from her initial arrest in 2008, as they continued to lead the search for their missing granddaughter, to the start of the murder trial.

Stone-faced: Cindy and George Anthony were the first people to leave the courtroom after the verdict on Tuesday

But on the opening day of the trial, 
the defence dropped a bombshell that Caylee was never missing but had 
drowned in an accident in the family's pool on June 16.

More
shocking was the accusation that George Anthony had sexually abused his
daughter when she was a child, and suggested the dysfunctional 
relationship explained

Anthony's behaviour after Caylee's death.

Defence lawyer Jose Baez said that Mr Anthony had a role in disposing the body and bullied his daughter, who he had molested from aged eight, into keeping it all secret.

The family have denied the defence's account of events that Caylee drowned in their pool.

In court, Cindy Anthony dismissed claims that she had left a ladder to the pool in place and George Anthony denied that he had ever sexually abused his daughter.

But Mrs Anthony was accused of lying under oath to protect her daughter from the death penalty when she testified that it was her who had made repeated Google searches for chloroform and neck injuries on the home computer not daughter Casey.

One of the most telling moments showing the animosity between Anthony and her parents came when Cindy Anthony left the witness stand and mouthed ‘I love you’ to her daughter, who rolled her eyes and looked away.
