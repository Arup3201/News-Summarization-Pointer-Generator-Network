A flamboyant businesswoman has been charged with drug dealing and money laundering offences after police raided her luxury home.

Paula White, an accountant who was once a director of Chester City football club, was arrested at her house in Eccles, Greater Manchester yesterday.

Last night police confirmed that the 44-year-old had been charged with conspiracy to supply Class A, B and C drugs and two counts of money laundering.

The charges come after a six-month probe into a website which sold nearly £4million worth of mephedrone to thousands of customers.

Arrest: Miss White is being questioned by police in connection with a website allegedly selling mephedrone

A £120,000 Aston Martin was seized from White's £800,000 home in a leafy suburb as part of the operation.

The businesswoman was last night remanded in custody and was due to appear at Bolton Magistrates' Court today.

According to company records, White 
served as a director for the now-defunct Chester City football club and 
Widnes rugby league club for a same three-week period in March 2007.

She has also been involved with a drinks retailer, as well as media and leisure businesses.

Seven months ago, she won planning permission to build a new swimming pool, gym and sun room at her home.

Luxury: Police officers searched the £800,000 home of Paula White, a 44-year-old businesswoman

Searched: Miss White's £120,000 Aston Martin was also seized by police 

Businesswoman: Miss White runs several media and leisure firms and was on the board of Chester City FC

Officers raided 11 addresses across 
Bolton, Bury, north Manchester and Salford. They are investigating the 
sale of approximately 313kg of mephedrone with the street value of £3.8m
through a website which was run from a unit in Bolton.

Those responsible allegedly advertised the 
drug as a ‘legal high’ - and officers believe it was the largest online 
mephedrone supply network in the UK.

Mephedrone, a Class B drug also known as 'meow meow' or MCAT, is a white synthetic powder which was criminalised in 2010.

Seven other people have been charged following the raids, and will appear in front of magistrates alongside White.

Huge operation: Police are investigating the sale of drugs through the website wide-mouth-frogs.com

Arrests: Police are questioning 12 people in connection with the website

Netta
Hymanson, 62, of Prestwich, has been charged with conspiracy to supply 
Class A, B and C drugs and two counts of money laundering.

Aaron
White, 20, of Salford; Christian White, 37, of Salford; Ian Mercer, 45,
of Walkden; Michaela Doyle, 42, of Salford; Sheena Jessop, 45, of 
Ramsbottom, and Rudi Chiu, 24, of Manchester have all been charged with 
conspiracy to supply Class A, B and C drugs.

A
29-year-old woman, arrested on suspicion of supply of controlled drugs 
and money laundering, has been bailed pending further enquiries.

The website at the centre of the 
investigation sold 35 different products and had processed tens of 
thousands of transactions over the past 12 months.

Well ogranised: The unit contained several labelled boxes filled with tablet bottles

Boxes: The police video shows boxes labelled with the names of 'legal highs' like salvia

Bottles: Police found hundreds of items which appeared to be pill jars

Powder: A tub full of a white substance was found on a metal sideboard in the unit

Vats: Huge blue tubs containing ingredients like lactose and starch were found in the unit

Although marketed as horticultural 
supplies, customer feedback on the site warned that the drugs were too 
dangerous to be taken with alcohol.

The website has since been closed down.

Last month Emma Johnston, 21, and 
father-of-one Chris Goodwin, 30, collapsed and died within minutes of 
each other after taking a mixture of alcohol, amphetamine and mephedrone
during an all-night party in Bolton.

Three other friends were also treated in hospital but recovered.

The source of the mephedrone they took is still unknown.

Refrigerated: Foil-packed goods appear to have been stored in this fridge

Packages: The warehouse contained several large boxes

Machinery: There were a number of electrical items in the unit

Equipment: Police also discovered machinery inside the industrial unit in Bolton

One neighbour said White always wore designer suits, adding: ‘That was her style.

‘She was obviously very successful and
mingled with the top of society, very successful people.

'She was quite 
pleasant but she is also a very tough woman who doesn’t suffer fools or 
bad tradesmen gladly. She is very feisty and very confident.

‘She always had personal trainers going to the house and had six dogs, little yappy things.

‘Her house is like something out of Hello! magazine. The interior is absolutely stunning with a designer kitchen and wet rooms.

‘I have a large garden but hers must have been about four times the size. I once got invited to a party. It was very swish. There were men at the door ticking your name off.’

Towed: Miss White's Aston Martin was seized by police

Illegal: Mephedrone, known as MCAT and meow, meow, was a legal high but was outlawed in 2010

Investigation: Forensic teams searched 11 addresses for evidence

Another local who saw the police 
operation said yesterday: ‘I was going to work at about 3pm when I saw 
three police units outside her house.

‘By the time I got home, every single light in the house was on.

‘They were emptying boxes and loading them into vans until 10.30pm.’

Greater Manchester Police said the 12 
arrested had been under surveillance since the end of last year after 
parcels were intercepted in the post and found to contain illegal drugs.

They were traced back to a warehouse in the Farnworth area of Bolton, and on Wednesday officers raided 11 homes.

Warehouse: Officers raided an industrial unit in Bolton, believed to be where the website was run from

Search: Forensics teams scoured the site for evidence during the series of raids

Drugs: Police are investigating the sale of 313kg of mephedrone worth £3.8million

Outlawed: Mephedrone is also known as MCAT, bubble or meow meow and was made illegal in 2010

Record: Police said this was the biggest operation of its kind since mephedrone was made illegal

Gang: Police arrested seven men and five women in connection with a website allegedly selling illegal drugs

Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson,
of the North West Regional Crime Squad, said: ‘These strikes have taken
months of planning and the operation reinforces our commitment to 
dismantle organised crime groups and tackle illegal drugs across our 
region.

‘Our priority is to disrupt and prevent the supply of drugs.

‘Let this be a reminder to anyone 
involved in the supply, that they will not only end up behind bars, but 
through the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation, they will also end up out
of pocket.’
