The Bank of England has stepped in to prevent the housing market from overheating – but indicated it is not worried if prices surge by a fifth over the next three years.

In an historic intervention, the central bank announced plans to ration risky loans by banning lenders from issuing any more than 15 per cent of their new mortgages at 4.5 times an applicant’s salary or higher.

Governor Mark Carney said the curbs should not make it any harder to get a mortgage – as the proportion is already below 15 per cent – and will have a ‘minimal impact’ on the housing market as long as prices rise in line with its expectations.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has moved to cool the housing market with new rules limiting large mortgages

Shares in the UK’s biggest housebuilders soared yesterday on hearing of the new regime, which will be enforced on October 1.

The value of Taylor Wimpey rose by more than 5 per cent or £175million.

The
 Bank is expecting house prices to rise by 20 per cent by early 2017, 
pushing the price of an average home from £186,512 to £223,814. It also 
expects household debt levels to rise by 15 per cent in that time.

Mr
 Carney said both scenarios were at ‘the limit of our tolerance’, 
suggesting he is prepared to take further action if the market 
accelerates any faster than that.

The
 Canadian described yesterday’s move as an ‘insurance policy’ to prevent
 the housing market from spinning out of control and ensure households 
do not take on too much debt.

At the same time the Treasury announced a ban on loans above 4.5 times salary on its Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme .

Chancellor George Osborne said the new rules will 'help protect our hard-won economic security by better insuring us against any risks that might emerge in our housing market'.

House prices in London rose by 18.7 per cent in the year to April,almost twice the national average of 9.9 per cent

He added: 'In the years before the Great Recession the failure to do this cost families dear and took our economy to the brink. 

'I gave the Bank of England these new powers because I’m determined that we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past. 

'I want to protect those who own homes, protect those who aspire to own a home, and protect the millions who suffer when boom turns to bust.

'Today’s announcement is a welcome sign that the new system we have created is working.'

Prices rose by 9.9 per cent in the year to April, surging by 18.7 per cent in London. In 33 areas of England and Wales, property prices increased in value by more than annual local wages.

First-time buyers have been hardest hit by the boom, with prices for them rising by more than 10 per cent in a year.

People getting on to the first rung of the property ladder paid a record £199,000 in April, almost 10 times the average salary of people in their twenties.

The new Bank of England rules could make it even harder to buy a house, with lenders forced to limit the number of large loans available.

The Bank's Financial Policy Committee has recommended that 'mortgage lenders do not extend more than 15 per cent of their total number of new residential mortgages at loan to income ratios at or greater than 4.5'. 

Prices paid by first-time buyers are up 10.7 per cent year-on-year, but only 9.5 per cent for those already on the property ladder

The rule will apply to all lenders who lend more than £100million each year and should be 'implemented as soon as is practicable'. 

It is already getting harder for buyers to get a loan, with banks limiting mortgage approvals despite rising demand.

The Bank of England reports that lenders forecast a 'lower appetite for risk' over the next three months

High street banks and lenders expect the number of new mortgage agreements to fall significantly from July to September.

It follows changes to the Mortgage Market Review which forces lenders to more closely scrutinise borrowers' income and outgoings to check if they can afford repayments if interest rates rise.

The Bank of England base rate of interest has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent since 2009

In the past, people applying for a mortgage were asked for three months’ pay slips and recent bank statements to show their major outgoings.

But since April they have faced invasive questions about their finances and lifestyle, from their weekly food bill to the cost of their childcare arrangements and even how much they spend on gym membership.

The new rules limiting the amount that can be loaned in relation to incomes will also push down mortgage approval rates. 

The Bank is putting more pressure on lenders to ensure their customers are prepared for, and able to cope with, a likely rise in interest rates. 

On Tuesday Governor Mark Carney appeared to row back on a warning last week that rates could rise before the end of the year, leading to claims he was blowing hot and cold on when families could expect mortgage costs to increase.

Giving evidence to the Treasury select committee, he told MPs that low wage growth and spare capacity in the economy meant a rate rise this year was less likely. 

Labour MP Pat McFadden said: 'The Bank is behaving a bit like an unreliable boyfriend. 

'One day hot, one day cold and the people on the other side of the message don't know where they stand.'

Last year the Bank said interest rates would not rise until the unemployment rate fell to 7 per cent, but when that target was met earlier than expected, it set broader criteria for a rise.

Having signalled an early rise last week, Mr Carney today appeared more doveish and played down the idea.

Mr McFadden added: 'The purpose of guidance is to achieve clarity of expectations among households and consumers.'

But Mr Carney insisted the message from Bank guidance had been 'very clearly received'. 

'As the economy progresses, the time to normalise interest rates is edging closer. It is coming closer. But what is most relevant is those adjustments will be through a gradual process that is likely to be lower that historical averages.'
