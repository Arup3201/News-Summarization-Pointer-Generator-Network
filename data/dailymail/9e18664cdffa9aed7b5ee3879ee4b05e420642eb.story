Extra topping: Austin Symonds, 18, was caught 'rubbing his testicles' on a customer's pizza

A teenage restaurant worker who was caught rubbing his genitals on a customer’s pizza has said it was an act of vengeance.

Austin Symonds was spotted by a customer ‘rubbing his testicles on the pizza he had ordered,’ a police statement read.

The 18-year-old later told police he wanted revenge as the customer had called in the order just before closing time.

Customer Brent Bradley arrived at Papa Murphy’s pizza in Georgetown, near Austin, Texas, to find that his family-sized stuffed pizza with bacon and extra cheese was being given additional topping.

Mr Bradley confronted Symonds, who immediately apologised, a complaint filed with Georgetown Police Department obtained by The Smoking Gun, reads.

A shocked Mr Bradley asked Symonds his age and after being told he was 18, he asked if Symonds was ‘old enough to know better than to put your balls on someone’s pizza.’

An apologetic Symonds acknowledged that this was the case.

However, he later told police that he would have given Mr Bradley the pizza had he not been caught.

During a police interview, Symonds told officers that he ‘did what he did because the customer had called in the order right before closing time,’ and admitted the crime.

The teenager has been charged with tampering with a consumer product, and is currently released on a $10,000 bail.

Symonds has, unsurprisingly, been fired from Papa Murphy’s.
