Liverpool, Tottenham and Celtic could face tricky ties in the last 32 of the Europa League as none of the trio are seeded for the draw.

Both Tottenham and Celtic were second in their respective Europa League groups while Liverpool dropped down from the Champions League after finishing third in their group.

That leaves Everton as the only seeded British team in the draw for the last 32.

Liverpool were eliminated from the Champions League and face a tough draw in the Europa League last 32

Everton finished top of Group H despite a 1-0 defeat by Krasnodar and will be seeded for the last 32 draw

Other seeded teams that Liverpool, Tottenham and Celtic could face include Inter Milan, Feyenoord, Napoli, Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao and Zenit St Petersburg.

Everton, who finished top of Group H in the Europa League, could potentially be drawn against Celtic in a battle of Britain.

But other unseeded teams who Roberto Martinez's men could face include Villarreal, Sevilla, Roma, Ajax and Wolfsburg.

The draw for the last 32 of the Europa League will be made on Monday lunchtime with the ties to be played over two legs on February 19 and 26.

Tottenham were beaten 1-0 by Besiktas in Istanbul and will be unseeded for the draw after finishing second
