A Texas appeals court on Thursday overturned a judge's ruling that had voided the marriage of a transgender widow whose firefighter husband died battling a blaze.

The 13th Texas Court of Appeals sent the case of Nikki Araguz back to the lower court, saying 'there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding [Araguz's] sex and whether the marriage was a same sex marriage.'

In 2011, state District Judge Randy Clapp in Wharton County ruled that the marriage between Nikki Araguz and her husband Thomas Araguz was 'void as a matter of law.'

Victory: An appeals court has overturned a decision that voided Nikki Araguz's marriage to her first husband Thomas Delgado because she was born male

Thomas Araguz's mother and his first wife Heather Delgado had challenged the marriage's validity, arguing the fallen firefighter's estate should go to his two sons because Nikki Araguz was born a man and Texas does not recognize same-sex marriage.

Attorneys for Delgado called the appeals court an 'activist court' relying on 'junk science' after the ruling.

Nikki Araguz, 38, had argued in court she had done everything medically and legally possible to show she is female and was legally married under Texas law and that she's entitled to widow's benefits.

'It’s never been about the money for me.' Nicki said as she celebrated the court ruling with supporters Thursday night.

'If I would have stayed quiet, the only narrative anyone would have heard was that I was a trickin' tranny who lied to my husband.'

At a press conference Friday, attorney for Delgado Ted Burwell demurred.

'Whenever someone says it’s not about the money, you know what it’s about,' he said.

The battle is over $635,000 in death benefits that the widow of a firefighter is entitled to. However, there is potentially millions more at stake.

A lawsuit alleging a faulty light was responsible for the 2010 blaze which killed Thomas Araguz could result in millions in damages.

Kent Rutter, Nikki Araguz's attorney, said his client was very pleased by Thursday's ruling.

'This decision recognizes that transgender Texans have the right to marry the person that they love,' he said.

Araguz has remarried since her first husband's death.

Attorneys for Simona Longoria, Thomas Araguz's mother, and Delgado, his ex-wife, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment.

Longoria and her family have said Thomas Araguz learned of his wife's gender history just before his death and had planned to end the marriage.

But Nikki Araguz, who remarried in 2013, has insisted Thomas Araguz fully supported her through the surgical process to become a woman. She underwent surgery two months after they were married in 2008.

Thomas Araguz died July 2010 while fighting a fire at an egg farm near Wharton, located 60 miles southwest of Houston. He was 30.

In its 26-page ruling, the three-judge panel of the Corpus Christi-based appeals court wrote that Clapp erred by essentially saying in his ruling that Nikki Araguz was a man at the time of her husband's death.

'I fully expect the other side to fight back as hate mongers often do,' said Nikki Araguz said Thursday.Burwell said that hate was not an issue in the case.

'To construe that anyone is hate mongering is Nikki is just grandstanding,' said Burwell.

Attorneys for Longoria and Delgado had argued Nikki Araguz was born with male sex organs and had such organs at the time of her marriage, making it invalid.

The appeals court said more expert testimony on this issue is needed as the only such testimony presented was an affidavit by one of Nikki Araguz's doctors, who wrote that she was medically and psychologically female as a result of her compliance with the standards of care adopted by the World Professional Association of Transgender Health.

The three-judge panel also wrote that changes made in 2009 to the Texas Family Code that allowed transgendered people to use proof of their sex change to get a marriage license legislatively overruled a previous court decision that had been used as legal precedent in such cases.

In that 1999 case, a San Antonio woman's wrongful-death claim brought on behalf of her husband was thrown out, with a court ruling that although the woman had undergone a sex-change operation, she was actually a man, based on her original birth certificate.
