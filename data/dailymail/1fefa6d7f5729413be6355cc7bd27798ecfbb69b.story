Prevented from dying with dignity: Brian Williams, 77, suffered 31 electric shocks in two days after doctors failed to switch off a heart defibrillator inside him

A dying father suffered 31 painful electric shocks in two days after doctors failed to switch off a heart defibrillator inside him.

Brian Williams, 77, was admitted to Tameside Hospital after he collapsed at home with a terminal brain tumour.

After doctors told his seven children he was unlikely to live, they decided to end his treatment.

But he was prevented from dying with dignity after doctors failed to turn off an implant fitted years earlier to regulate an abnormal heart rhythm.

Defibrillator implants are fitted in people with abnormal heart rhythms and can give the heart electric shocks to restore the patient’s heart beat.

They are inserted just under the collar bone and are the size of a matchbox.

In this case, it meant that every time Mr Williams was finally slipping away, he suffered an electric shock inside his body as the device tried to restart his heart and bring him back to life.

It was only when Mr Williams’ son-in-law held his hand and he was shocked himself that doctors realised their mistake.

The pensioner's defibrillator implant was eventually deactivated and he died a few hours later.

Tameside NHS Foundation Trust has since admitted staff failed to identify the defibrillator and switch it off at the appropriate time. It has agreed an undisclosed out-of-court settlement with the family.

But Mr Williams's children today told how they have still to receive an apology two years after his death in April 2012.

Daughter Lynda Beresford said she and her six siblings will never forget seeing their father in such distress.

Lynda, 58, said: 'The whole family are absolutely devastated by the nature of my dad’s death and the care he received at Tameside Hospital.

'We had to see him suffer as the defibrillator shocked him back to life more than 30 times in just two days.

Specialist medical lawyer Ayse Ince, of legal firm Irwin Mitchell which representedthe family, said: 'This is a very tragic case in which the family had to watch as their terminally ill father endured a painful and inhumane death - quite the opposite of what was intended by medical staff.'

A Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'The trust unreservedly apologises to the family of Brian Williams regarding the clinical care issues experienced in 2012.

'Since this incident in 2012 there have been significant changes in regard to end of life care practice in the trust.'
