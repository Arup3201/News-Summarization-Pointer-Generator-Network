A teen girl was shot dead by police while leaving a field party early Saturday morning and outraged locals are demanding answers.

Samantha Ramsey, 19, of Hebron, Kentucky, was shot four times after hitting a Boone County Sheriff’s Office deputy with her car, authorities said. But friends claim Tyler Brockman jumped on the hood of her car and opened fire.

Brockman suffered only a leg injury and was placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, sources told WLWT.

‘She lost her life for him jumping on the hood of a young girl’s car,’ friend Gunnar Buemi told the station during a vigil.

Buemi became more enraged as the day went on.

‘That's murder!’ He shouted while frantically waving his arms as people cheered him on. ‘Justice needs to be done about this injustice. We're all sitting here lighting candles, being quiet when the government is out here shooting.

‘Any other human would have been put in jail for that. He needs to answer for what he did to that family.’

He was not alone in his outrage.

Grieving: Mother Brandi Stewart attended the candlelight vigil and said she wants answers

Outraged: Friend Gunnar Buemi shouted that Ramsey was murdered and called for the cop to be jailed

‘Just to be shot four times that's excessive,’ friend Lynsy Hall told WXIX. ‘That wasn't right. He could have killed the other three people that were in the car’

One of the girls in the car said the officer used excessive force.

‘The cop was in the wrong,’ Chelsea Pendleton told the Cincinnati Enquirer. ‘I was there. I was in the back seat. That was unnecessary force. He had no right to do that.’

‘That was dead body weight on the gas pedal after she was shot,’ she added.

A large crowd including the slain teen’s mother gathered to light candles on the side of the road. She isn’t angry, but she does want to know what happened.

‘I just want to know what happened. I want answers,’ Brandi Stewart lamented to WXIX. ‘He was the last person that looked in my daughter's eyes that saw her face and I want answers.’

The gathering was large enough to close the road, and it brought back memories for one of the passengers in Ramsay’s car when all hell broke loose.

‘After the shots, I ducked down and then we're reversing back into the ditch and we couldn't get out for a second and I opened the door and dropped to my knees and started bawling my eyes out,’ Chelsea Pendleton told WLWT.

Authorities have not commented on the shooting other than to say an investigation is ongoing.Her friends and mother are trying to remember her in a better light.

It is not yet known if Ramsey had been drinking or doing drugs prior to the incident, police are awaiting toxicology results for confirmation.

‘I wouldn't have expected anything less because she was so loved, you know, she's a good person,’ Stewart added. ‘She loved people, they loved her. She was a people person.’
