Firing a rifle into the air and a pond, this is the shocking moment police shoot an armed man in a city park.

Joshua Twohig, 21, has been charged with aggravated assault on a public servant following the incident in Houston, Texas, on November 21.

The father-of-one was last night still in hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

Caught on camera: Joshua Twohig points a rifle at his head after he allegedly walked into a Houston park and began shooting into the air. A passer-by pleading with Twohig to lower his weapon can be seen on the right

Officers claim Twohig walked into 
Tranquility Park, near the Occupy Houston protest site, at around 5.15pm
dressed in a black suit, smoking a cigarette and carrying a .40-calibre
rifle.

He then discharged the weapon into the air, fired a shot into a pond and waved the gun at passers-by, it is claimed.

As he paced up and down a small pedestrian bridge, Twohig even pointed the rifle to his own head.

Two nearby police officers on bicycle patrol arrived quickly on the scene and told him to drop his weapon.

But, according to eyewitnesses, Twohig refused and shouted back, 'Shoot me! Shoot me!'

It was at this point that police 
claim the gunman began moving towards them. Officers fired several shots
at him and Twohig fell to the ground.

The 21-year-old quickly rises to his feet and makes a grab for his weapon, at which point he is shot again

Video of the incident shot by passer-by David 
Loeser shows Twohig quickly standing up and moving for his rifle before 
he is shot again.

A stray bullet splashes into the pond as he slumps to the ground.

Mr Loeser: 'I'm glad that the gentleman did not point his gun at all these innocent people here.'

Nobody else was injured in the shooting, which police said was unrelated to Occupy Houston.

Cameraman: David Loeser was with friends having just visited the nearby Occupy Houston demonstration when he spotted Twohig and filmed the stand-off

A spokesman for the demonstration 
said: 'Occupy Houston is not speculating on the motives of the gunman, 
but we extend our sympathies to the seemingly troubled young man who 
perpetrated this act of violence.

'We are thankful that no one other 
than the assailant was injured, and we extend our gratitude to the 
officers on scene who reacted quickly and with the appropriate amount of
force as dictated by the situation.'

Twohig's possible motives are unknown and are under investigation.

However, it has been reported that he recently lost his job, has a one-year-old child and that his wife underwent major surgery.
