Escaped jail: Angela Roberts, 45, of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, was given a community order after admitting assaulting Valerie Barrett with her shoe

A mother-of-two who left a woman with a 1.5inch gash on her head after hitting her with a stiletto in a drunken rage has escaped with just a community order.

Angela Roberts, 45, had drunk five pints of lager when she heard that her father had been assaulted at a nearby Wetherspoons pub in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent.

Assuming the attacker to be Valerie Barrett, whom she had rowed with in a different pub earlier, Roberts went to the Reginald Mitchell pub in Stoke-on-Trent in search of her.

A court heard that as she walked in, she heard a bouncer describe the attacker over his radio, and spotted Miss Barrett, who matched the description.

Roberts, from Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, struck Miss Barrett in the head with the stiletto, gashing her head and leaving her covered in blood.

Police were called to the Reginald Mitchell pub and Roberts, who had never been in trouble with the police before, was arrested at the scene.

Yesterday she pleaded guilty to one charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

Prosecuting Fiona Cortese told the court that Miss Barrett had gone to the pub with her daughter when she was attacked.

She said: 'Miss Barrett and her daughter went to the Reginald Mitchell pub and at some point there was an altercation with an elderly male.

'She later described feeling a blow to her head. The next thing she remembered was being in an ambulance.

'A door supervisor saw the defendant inside carrying a stiletto in her hand.

'She was walking quickly towards Miss Barrett and he saw her swing the stiletto, which connected with her head.'

Ms Cortese added that Roberts was drunk when police arrived, having drank five pints of lager throughout the day.

The defendant told officers she had gone out with her father and had seen Miss Barrett and her daughter earlier on in another pub.

Scene: The attack took place at the Reginald Mitchell pub in the Hanley district of Stoke-on-Trent

The court heard they had a heated discussion and altercation before the stiletto attack, which happened later that evening.

Jason Holt, defending Roberts, said she had no previous convictions and was having counselling as a result of the incident.

He said: 'A description was given by the door staff and it was quite obvious the people they were talking about.

'That is why she went in the pub, believing she was going to defend her father.

'She took off her shoes, not to use as a weapon. When she approached this woman, they were in her hands.'

Roberts was handed a 12-month community order and told to pay £750 compensation.

Sentencing,
 Judge David Fletcher said: 'I accept it was a single blow, and the 
stiletto was not taken off to be used as a weapon.

'The main aggravating feature was the amount of alcohol that you consumed.

'I have absolutely no doubt this would not have happened if you had not been drinking the amount you had.'
