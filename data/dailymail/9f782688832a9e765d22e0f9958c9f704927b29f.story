Jimmy Anderson came under fire from India again as he began preparing for a ‘home’ Test at Old Trafford that could take him to the brink of English bowling history.

Anderson, dramatically cleared of abusing and pushing Ravindra Jadeja last week, will go into Thursday’s fourth Test needing only 13 wickets to become England’s leading wicket-taker of all time but with India still seething over his behaviour at Trent Bridge.

The speed with which judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis threw out a Level Three charge against Anderson on Friday was an embarrassment for India, but they are showing little sign of taking it on the chin and moving on.

Common sense prevails: James Anderson has been cleared lf physically assaulting Ravindra Jedeja (R)

Spat: Anderson and Jadeja were embroiled in a row as they left the Trent Bridge pitch

Delight: Anderson cannot hide his emotions after dismissing Jadeja at the Ageas Bowl

An unnamed BCCI official was scathing in his criticism of England’s attack leader on the respected Wisden India website and it is clear that a country who are used to getting their own way still hope to force an appeal.

‘Clearly the judgment is incorrect,’ said the Indian official of a verdict made by Lewis in just 10 minutes after six hours of expensive evidence. ‘And it sets a very bad example. There were a series of errors. The level of abuse has been ridiculous and the ICC have a lot to answer for. What example does it set for kids and others watching? It sends the message that it is OK to abuse and push and you’ll still go scot-free.

‘The umpire (Bruce Oxenford) has mentioned in his witness statement that Anderson used the ‘f’ and ‘c’ words repeatedly. Why haven’t the officials reported him to the ICC? If they have, why has no action been taken?’

The comments confirm that the crux of India’s high-handed complaint, which was driven by captain MS Dhoni despite attempts by the ICC, ECB and even his own Board to talk him out of it, was sparked by Anderson’s sledging.

The man who could overtake Sir Ian Botham by the end of this series is quiet, almost shy, off the field but gets himself into ‘battle mode’ when he steps on to it.

Anderson has talked about the two sides to his personality and his work with a sports psychologist, calling himself Jimmy on the field and James off it. England feel Anderson is at his best when he is Jimmy but also in control of his emotions. He is already England’s leading wicket-taker in all international cricket and, just 32, he looks poised to break every record in the book, testament to his exceptional competitiveness, skill and work ethic.

The question now is whether the Lancastrian can keep his aggression in check and still bowl as well as he did at the Ageas Bowl when he reached heights not seen from him for over a year. And avoid any more flashpoints.

Leader of the attack: Anderson was man of the match in England's third Test win at the Ageas Bowl

For fourth Test vs India at Old Trafford, starting on August 7

Cook (c), Ali, Anderson, Ballance,  Bell,  Broad, Buttler (wkt), Jordan, Plunkett, Robson,  Root, Stokes, Woakes.

Any appeal against the Australian judge’s verdict — and Lewis also cleared Jadeja of all wrong-doing — can only come through ICC chief executive David  Richardson and there seemed  little appetite for official intervention on Monday despite India’s huffing and puffing.

The deadline for an appeal and a further twist in this acrimonious tale is Friday.

England’s perfect script sees Anderson driving England to victory in this series and overtaking Botham in the final Test at the Kia Oval, his 99th and the last England will play until they tour the Caribbean next April. Yet Anderson has never taken five wickets in an innings on his home ground.

It now seems certain that Stuart Broad will be fit enough to take  his place, while Chris Woakes looks sure to get another chance, leaving three bowlers competing for the last seam place.

Chris Jordan is in possession and was exceptional at Old Trafford in the one-day international against Sri Lanka this season, while Ben Stokes is a strong contender on what is expected to be the quickest pitch of the Investec series.

England have to be careful they do not chop and change too much but there is a strong case for  Steven Finn, added to the squad on Sunday when Liam Plunkett pulled out with injury, to leapfrog Jordan and Stokes on a pitch where his extra pace could well prove a handful.

Ulterior motives? England believe that Ravindra Jadeja's accusations were a purely tactical move by India
