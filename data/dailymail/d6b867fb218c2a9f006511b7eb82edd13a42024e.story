This seven-acre compound is an extension of The Sanctuary, the private island retreat of the fashion designer.

This was a line that started with simnplicity - women dressed in black bodysuits and tights, and then added skirts, jumpers, jackets and cashmere layers to create a clothing revolution. 

Then came the launch of her eponymous label DKNY, its origins can be traced back to 1984, but it didn't become a publicly trading brand until 1996.

Celebrities such as model Cara Delevigne and singer Rita Ora continue to keep the brand to the forefront of today's generation.
