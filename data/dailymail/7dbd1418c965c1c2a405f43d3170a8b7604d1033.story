The girlfriend of the co-pilot on board the missing Malaysia airlines flight is holed up in a hotel with his family as she anxiously awaits news of the plane's fate.

Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, was planning to marry his girlfriend Captain Nadira Ramli, 26, a fellow pilot from another airline.

The Sabah-based Daily Express said that 
Miss Nadira, 26, has been given a month's leave as she awaits news of the 
flight's final destination.

Details of the relationship emerged as it
 was revealed flight MH370's captain is a relative of Malaysia's jailed 
opposition leader. Intensive background checks on everyone aboard 
had turned up no-one else with a political or criminal motive to crash or 
hijack the plane.

Interest in the co-pilot of the missing Malyasia airlines plane has been renewed after it was revealed this week that he was the last person to communicate from the cockpit after the communication system was cut off.

Mr Hamid met Miss Nadira when they studied together at the Langkawi pilot school and the couple have known each other for nine years.

Miss Nadira flies for Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia - Malaysia Airlines' fierce rival - and is the daughter of a senior Malaysia Airlines pilot, local media reports said.

Nadira Ramli is now with Mr Fariq's distraught mother at an undisclosed hotel in Kuala Lumpur

A relative in Kota Kinabalu, who declined to be named, told the newspaper that described the young pilot was calm in the face of adversity 'and a pillar of strength to Fariq's mother who had hardly slept for three days'.

'Nadira is positive about the incident and told her family not to listen to the TV. Despite what has happened, she still has a glimmer of hope,' said the relative.

The paper added that Miss Nadira was the youngest child of Captain Ramli Ibrahim and Nancy Jipanis of Penampang in Sabah.

Hamid had his reputation called into question by a South African woman who accused him of inviting her to join him in the cockpit for a journey in 2011, in breach of security rules.

Malaysia Airlines said it was 'shocked' by the reported security violation, but could not verify the claims.

But those who knew him have described the son of a top state civil servant as a mild-mannered young man with a bright piloting future.

Fariq regularly visited his neighbourhood mosque outside Kuala Lumpur where he also attended occasional Islamic courses, said Ahmad Sharafi Ali Asrah, the mosque's imam or spiritual leader, who called him 'a good boy'.

Fariq appeared in a CNN travel segment in February in which he helped fly a plane from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur.

It chronicled his transition to piloting the Boeing 777-200 after having completed training in a flight simulator.

CNN correspondent Richard Quest called Fariq's technique 'textbook-perfect,' according to the network's website.

Details of Fariq's personal life emerged as it was revealed today that his 'fanatical' co-pilot is related to Malaysia's jailed opposition leader.

After previously denying he 
recognised the pliot's name, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim admitted 
that Malaysia Airlines MH370 Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is related to 
his son-in-law.

'I am not denying that he (Zaharie) is related to one of my in-laws and that I have met him on several occasions,' he said.

After previously denying he reconigsed his name,
 opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, left, has admitted that Malaysia 
Airlines MH370 pilot Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, right, is related to 
his son in law

He also admitted Zaharie is a close friend of PKR supreme council member and Subang MP R. Sivarasa.

He added: 'To politicise this is not 
right. We should respect the family's rights and pray for them instead 
of prosecuting him before the investigation is completed.'

Anwar
 further admitted that Zaharie was a staunch opposition supporter and 
that he had met the pilot on a few occasions at party functions.

He said: 'I am not one to hide my associations with others. I have met him once or twice but I do not remember how many times.'

The government has called on the public not to 'jump to conclusions' about the two men, saying they were not on record as asking to fly together on March 8.

Sympathetic tributes to them have poured out online.

In a YouTube memorial a collage of photos from various stages of Zaharie's life shows him happily socialising with friends and family, flying model airplanes, and doing volunteer work as the song 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' plays.

Also today, China's ambassador to 
Malaysia said his country had carried out a detailed probe into its 
nationals aboard the flight and could rule out their involvement.

U.S.
 and European security sources said efforts by various governments to 
investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the flight had not, as of 
Monday, turned up links to militant groups or anything else that could 
explain the jet's disappearance.

A European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur also said trawls through the passenger manifest had come up blank.

Families of the passengers aboard the missing plane decided to organize a hunger strike to express their anger and disappointment at the handling of the situation by authorities

They decided on the action after a daily morning meeting with two officials from Malaysia Airlines

Meanwhile, furious Chinese families today 
threatened to go on hunger strike until the Malaysian government tells 
them the truth about the fate of their relatives aboard the flight which
 went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Ten
 days after the airliner vanished an hour into its flight, hundreds of 
family members are still waiting for information in a Beijing hotel.

Around two thirds of the 239 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are Chinese.

Families
 vented their pain and anger on Chinese representatives sent by the 
airline to meet them on Tuesday and demanded to see the Malaysian 
ambassador.

'What we want is the truth. Don't let
 them become victims of politics. No matter what political party you 
are, no matter how much power you have, if there isn't life, what's the 
point? Where is compassion?' asked one middle-aged woman angrily.

'You're
 always going back and forth. I think your government knows in their 
heart why we want you to answer us. Because you're always tricking us, 
telling us lies,' added one man.

China
 has repeatedly called on the Malaysian side to do a better job at 
looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers, and to provide 
them with updated information.

Today
 China announced checks into the background of all the Chinese nationals
 on board the missing Malaysian jetliner have uncovered no links to 
terrorism.

The remarks by 
the Chinese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur will dampen speculation that 
Uighur separatists in far western Xinjiang province might have been 
involved with the disappearance of the Boeing 777 and its 239 passengers
 and crew early on March 8.

The
 plane was carrying 154 Chinese passengers, when Malaysian officials say
 someone on board deliberately diverted it from its route to Beijing 
less than one hour into the flight.

A massive search operation has yet to find any trace of the plane.

Chinese
 Ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang said today that background checks 
on Chinese nationals did not uncover any evidence suggesting they were 
involved in hijacking or an act of terrorism against the plane, 
according to state news agency Xinhua.

He also said that Chinese authorities had begun searching for the plane on its territory.

The Australian Marine Safety Authority (AMSA) is coordinating a search of water spanning more than 600,000 square kilometres, some 3200km southwest of Perth

Malaysian
 police are investigating the pilots and ground engineers of the plane, 
and have asked intelligence agencies from countries with passengers on 
board to carry out background checks on those passengers.

They say they are 
investigating the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or 
issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on 
board, but have yet to give any update on what they have uncovered.

Late yesterday it emerged that the 
turn that diverted the missing Malaysian Airlines plane off its flight 
path was programmed into the aircraft's computer navigation system, 
probably by someone in the cockpit, the New York Times reported.

That
 reinforces the increasing belief among investigators that the aircraft 
was deliberately diverted, the newspaper said, quoting U.S. officials.

Rather
 than manually operating the plane's controls, whoever altered Flight 
370's path typed seven or eight keystrokes into a computer situated 
between the captain and the co-pilot, according to officials.

The computer is called the Flight Management System.

Malaysian
 military radar spotted the plane in the northern reaches of the Strait 
of Malacca at 2.14am local time on March 8, just over 90 minutes after 
it took off from Kuala Lumpur.

That is the plane's last known confirmed position.

Today
 Australian authorities said they had begun searching 600,000 square 
kilometres of the remote Indian Ocean for missing Malaysia Airlines 
flight MH370, and conceded it was like looking for a needle in a 
haystack.

British Prime Minister David Cameron also today telephoned his Malaysian counterpart to offer Britain's help in dealing with the disappearance of Flight MH370.

Mr Cameron also told Najib Razak that his thoughts were with the families of those who were on board the Malaysian Airways jet, which went missing on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

It was the first direct contact between the two prime ministers since the mystery began, said Mr Cameron's official spokesman.

The Malaysian 
government has revealed it believes the jet was deliberately diverted 
and flew for several hours after leaving its scheduled flight path - 
either north towards Central Asia, or towards the southern Indian Ocean.
