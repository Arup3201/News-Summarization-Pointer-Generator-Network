Tom Daley has won yet another accolade as he was voted ‘Best British Sports Star’ at the Radio 1 Teen Awards.

The annual event, now in its fifth year, took place at the SSE Arena in Wembley and honours the UK’s unsung teenage heroes as well as the year’s best sport, music and entertainment stars.

The British diving star earned widespread acclaim last December after revealing he was in a gay relationship in an emotional video posted on YouTube.

Daley, who claimed gold in the 10m platform at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, followed up his 'Best British Young Sports Star' award back in 2012. 

The Plymouth native, who made his Olympic debut at the Beijing Games as a 14-year-old,  won a bronze medal at London 2012.

Andy Murray claimed the award last year after he became to first British tennis player to win a Wimbledon title in 77 years. 

The 20-year-old Olympian was chosen by Radio 1 listeners as the winner from a shortlist that included golf star Rory McIlroy, gymnast Claudia Fragapane, swimmer Erraid Davies and sprinter Adam Gemili.
