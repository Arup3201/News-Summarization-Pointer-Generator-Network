An AWOL Muslim soldier who 'plotted to an attack' on Fort Hood shouted the name of a military psychiatrist accused of a 2009 shooting rampage at the base in his first court appearance today.

Pvt. Nasser Jason Abdo, was arrested yesterday near the base after police were alerted by a local gun shop owner that Abdo had been acting 'suspicious'.

The 21-year-old was formally charged with illegal possession of a firearm two days after his arrest in a Killeen, Texas, motel room in possession of suspected bomb-making materials.

'Abeer Qassim al-Janabi Iraq 2006; Nidal Hasan, Fort Hood, 2009,' Abdo shouted at the media as he was led out of the Waco courtroom.

Nidal Hasan is a military psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people and wounding 32 at a medical facility on Fort Hood in 2009.

Hasan, who is in a wheelchair after being shot by police during the attack, faces court martial next year.

Abdo's outburst was the first public indication of his possible intentions when he was arrested.

The news follows reports Al-Qaeda magazine 'Inspire' was also found by investigators in Abdo's hotel room.

Abc reported police found the article titled 'How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom' in the issue.

The network also reported that Abdo had mentioned the name of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula during interrogations.

The FBI that his plan was to attack Fort Hood and blow up a local restaurant, according to an FBI affidavit filed with the charges on Friday.

It previously emerged Abdo was already being investigated for child pornography before he went AWOL on July 4.

After being detained, police say they recovered possible bomb making materials from his hotel room.

According
to abc news, police reports said Abdo told them he was targeting the 
base to 'get even,' possibly after his discharge from the army was 
delayed until after the child porn trial.

Alert: Greg Ebert of Guns Galore, warned police about Abdo

He was arrested Wednesday afternoon after a call from Greg Ebert, an employee at a Killeen gun shop, who told Reuters he was concerned when Abdo bought ammunition and smokeless powder.

It was the same gun shop where Hasan bought his weapons two years ago.

An affidavit by FBI agent James Runkel said Abdo told police he intended to conduct an attack against Killeen and Fort Hood.

He also indicated in response to questions that there were explosives in his backpack and in his hotel room, Runkel said.

His backpack was searched and the 
officers found a handgun, ammunition, items that can be used to 
construct a 'destructive device, Runkel said.

He said FBI personnel then 
interviewed Abdo on July 27 and he, 'admitted that he planned to 
assemble two bombs in the hotel room using gun powder and shrapnel 
packed into pressure cookers to detonate inside an unspecified 
restaurant frequented by solders from Fort Hood.'

Abdo - who was due to be deployed in 
Afghanistan -Â  had applied for conscientious objector status in August 
which was initially denied.

However a military review board this spring finally 
recommended approval of his request.

But his discharge was delayed pending the outcome of a trial for allegedly possessing child pornography on his government issued laptop.

It is thought that Abdo believed the delay was punishment for him wanting to leave the army.

In September Abdo announced his conscientious objector status, saying his faith and the military didn't mix.

He said: 'As a Muslim, we stand 
against injustice, we stand against discrimination, and I feel it's my 
duty as an individual to do this.

'I knew that if I went to Afghanistan
and, God forbid, something were to happen, that my faith was so weak 
that I wouldn't be admitted into heaven.'
