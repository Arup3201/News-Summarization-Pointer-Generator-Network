A family in Los Angeles have told of their horror at returning home to find one of their dogs dead and another in a critical condition after being attacked by a swarm of killer bees.

Justin and Heather Umphenours made the shocking discovery on Sunday at their house in Covina, finding their two German Shepherd-mixes collapsed in the backyard surrounded by hundreds of bees.

One dog, Luna, died from her injuries, while her brother, Wolf, was rushed to Inland Valley Emergency Pet Clinic.

'They're members of the family - we've had them since they were four weeks old. They were abandoned,' Mr Umphenours told KTLA.

Killed: German Shepherd-mix Luna died on Sunday after being stung hundreds of times by a swarm of bees

Fighting for life: Wolf survived the attack but is struggling to recover from hundreds of stings, most of them in his face and mouth

Swarm: Justin and Heather Umphenours said they returned to their Covina home to find hundreds of bees swarming their two dogs

Heartbroken: Justin and Heather Umphenours have called neighbors and local schools in an effort to prevent the same thing from happening to anyone else

'To see something like that - to see your animals lying on the ground helpless - is just heartwrenching.'

The wild honeybees in the San Gabriel Valley are known as killer bees.

Hybrids of European and African strains, they aggressively protect their hives by attacking in swarms, the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District told The Los Angeles Daily News.

However the Umphenours, who have four children, say they have never seen bees near their home in the seven years they have lived there.

The family said they spent Saturday cutting down branches of lemon trees in their backyard.

While they didn't see any hives, they worry the yard work somehow stirred up the bees.

'It's horrific enough that it happened to our animals,' Mrs Umphenours said.

'To know that it might happen to someone else's family - I just don't want that to happen.'

Critical: Wolf, who remains at the Inland Valley Emergency Pet Clinic, was stung primarily on his face

Scene: The family spent Saturday trimming lemon trees in their yard, which may have spurred the bee attack

Best friends: The family had the dogs - both abandoned - since they were four-weeks-old

Wolf continues to fight for his life at the animal hospital.

Several hundred stingers have already been removed from his tongue.

The vet said the stings inside the dog's mouth came from him biting at the bees.

He was mostly stung in his face.

A friend of the Umphenours has set up a Go Fund Me account help raise money for Wolf’s vet bills, which were expected to exceed $6000.
