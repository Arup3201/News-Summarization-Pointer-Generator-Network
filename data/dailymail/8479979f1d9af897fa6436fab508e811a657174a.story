Parents in a Pennsylvania school district are turning 50 shades of red over word search puzzles given to their middle school students based on an erotic novel and movie.

At least five students at Monessen Middle School were given puzzles based on 'Fifty Shades of Grey', the graphic bondage book by E.L. James that was recently adapted to a film. 

The puzzles contained terms including 'spanking,' 'submissive,' 'leather cuffs' and 'bondage'.

Inappropriate: This crossword puzzle, fashioned to explicit novel and now-movie Fifty Shades of Grey, was handed out to students at Monessen Middle School

Raunchy: Some of the words in the puzzle were so risque they had to be covered up for a local news story

Officials in the Monessen School District say they can't say who passed out the puzzles or how many students received one because they just learned about it Monday.

Parents complained about it at Tuesday night's school board meeting.

'We just learned of this issue yesterday,' said school board solicitor John Toohey. 

'An investigation will occur.' 

Scene: The puzzle was given to at least five students at Monessen Middle School in Pennsylvania 

Upset: Parent James Carter says that his son was given the crossword and he was shocked at the terms

Investigation: School board solicitor John Toohey (right) said they are trying to work out who gave out the crossword puzzle to students and why they did it

Superintendent Leanne Spazak also said the incident was under investigation.

Parent James Carter says he tried to question the school's principal and dean of students about the puzzle his son received, but they refused when he insisted on recording their conversation.

'I asked my son who passed it out, and he said the teacher passed it out,' Carter told Pittsburgh's Action News 4. 

'I don't think this is what they should be doing in the 8th grade level.' 

Steamy: The story of Fifty Shades of Grey follows the submission of Anastasia (played by Dakota Johnson in the film) into the bondage fetishism of reclusive millionaire Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan)
