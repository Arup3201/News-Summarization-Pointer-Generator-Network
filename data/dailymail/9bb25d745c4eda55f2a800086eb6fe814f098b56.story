Southern California residents have complained about their tap water being black and smelling like sewage.

Diane Morita, 59, from the city of Gardena provided video footage to KTLA 5 - TV showing discolored liquid running out of her toilet and bathroom sink faucet.

A neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous, also provided a photo to the news station showing the same thing happening in her bathtub. 

She claimed that her daughter developed a rash after bathing in the inky water.

Meanwhile Emy Sebastian, another Gardena local, said she's been finding small stones in her odorous water: 

And Charlotte Lynch, who lives nearby, reported that the liquid has a 'gooey' and 'spider web-like' texture.

Morita said that she's seen black water in her home several times.

She added: 'It’s disgusting . . . It looks like there’s charcoal in the water.' 

Not impressed: Morita said that she's seen black water in her home several times - she kept a specimen (seen above) to prove what she had witnessed

In a bid to prove what she had witnessed she kept a specimen of the liquid. She says her main concern is the health of her family.

'We have one dog with cancer . . . one of my daughters has skin issues,' she said.

Despite the reports Kate Nutting, a general manager for the Golden State Water Company, claims the water is safe. 

She says the company takes samples  every week and all of their tests indicate the water is drinkable.

However, following numerous complaints the water board has now launched an investigation to determine the source of the problem. The inquiry remains ongoing.
