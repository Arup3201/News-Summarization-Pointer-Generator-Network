The last time Rudy Gestede faced Liverpool, he missed a penalty in the biggest game of his career so far as Cardiff lost the 2012 League Cup final in a shootout at Wembley.

It took three years for Gestede to get another chance from the spot – scoring against Stoke City last month to help Blackburn through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup – and the striker will not be afraid to step up again if Rovers win a penalty at Anfield on Sunday.

‘Yeah, I would take it,’ said the Benin international. ‘That was a great final but penalties are a lottery and I missed mine. I remember it to this day. It’s still the biggest game I’ve played in.

It took three years for Gestede - now at Blackburn Rovers - to get another chance from the spot

The 26-year-old sent Stoke City keeper Jack Butland the wrong way in the previous round of the FA Cup

‘I was younger then and I was a bit tired because it was the end of the game after extra-time.

‘That remains the only penalty I have missed. But it’s gone, it’s finished, it’ s behind me. It’s going to be a different game on Sunday.’

Gestede’s 15 goals this season have not gone unnoticed in the Premier League, and Blackburn rejected a £3.5milion offer from Crystal Palace in the January transfer window.

After scoring against Swansea and Stoke in the earlier rounds, the 26-year-old sees Sunday’s game as another opportunity to showcase his talents.

Gestede has the opportunity to move to the Premier League during January but chose to wait 

He added: ‘If I can do well against Liverpool I can show Premier League clubs that the speculation was there because I’m a good player and not just because I’m tall and score a few goals with my head.

‘It was close with one club but I spoke a lot with the manager and he helped me to stay focused and think about Blackburn.

‘Nothing happened so in my mind I never left the club. It was a good chance to play in the Premier League but I wasn’t that disappointed.’
