Four in five voters back Ed Miliband’s pledge to freeze energy bills – but half doubt Labour will be able to deliver it.

The Big Six energy firms will today face MPs amid growing public anger at bills rising by up to 10 per cent this winter.

David Cameron is under intense pressure to act to curb rises, with almost 70 per cent of Tories backing Mr Miliband’s policy to freeze rises for two years.

Voters back Milliband's freeze

Threat: Labour leader Ed Miliband used his conference speech last month to promise to freeze energy bills for 20 months if he wins the 2015 election

Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises, with ScottishPower bills going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.

The firms have variously blamed rising wholesale prices, bills for upgrading gas mains and electricity cables and extra green levies imposed by the government.

But official figures released by energy regulator Ofgem reveal company profits have doubled in a year, while wholesale costs have risen by just 1.7 per cent.

Mr Miliband used his party conference speech last month to promise Labour would freeze energy bills for 20 months if he wins the 2015 election.

It would save the average household £120 each and businesses will be £1,800 better off on their gas and electricity bills.

A new survey reveals 80 per cent of voters support the idea of freezing gas and electricity prices while reforms to the Big Six energy companies are made.

Worrying for Mr Cameron, the idea is supported by 69 per cent of Tory voters.

However, the ComRes/Independent poll shows voters are sceptical that Mr Miliband actually freeze bills.

Only 41 per cent agree Labour would deliver on the pledge, while 52 per cent disagree.

One in five Labour voters think Mr Miliband is likely to break his promise.

Overall Labour has an eight-point lead in the poll, on 36 per cent ahead of the Tories on 28 per cent. The Lib Dems are on 11 per cent and UKIP 12 per cent.

The Big Six energy firms are expected to get a rough ride when they face the energy select committee today.

Labour’s shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: ‘The energy companies must come clean about why they are imposing yet another round of inflation-bust price rises this winter when they are already making huge profits.

‘The latest revelations about rising profits and the growing gap between wholesale costs and household energy bills highlight why answers are needed.

‘Britain's energy market isn't working for ordinary families and businesses.’

Pressure: Calls have grown for action on bills from David Cameron, who today met The Poppy Girls outside Number 10 ahead of the Royal British Legion's 2013 Poppy Appeal

Consumer group Which? has written to George Osborne calling for him to take action to curb costs in the autumn statement, warning that three in ten people do not know how they will afford to heat their homes this winter.

‘People need your help - and they need it now,’ it has told the Chancellor.

It calls for a number of measures to be introduced to claw back cash, including separating energy generation from supply to help make the wholesale market more competitive, scrapping the carbon floor price, freezing the smart meter roll out for two years, removing the Warm Home Discount from consumers' bills and reforming the Energy Companies Obligation, which helps people insulate their homes.

The plans could save consumers up to £1.8 billion per year, Which? estimates.

Executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Consumers have been left reeling by the recent round of inflation busting price hikes. People need help to cope with the rising cost of their energy bills - and they need it now.

‘When George Osborne stands up to deliver his autumn statement we want him to stand up for the millions of hard-pressed consumers who are grappling day-to-day with rising energy costs. He must cut the Big Six companies and the cost of Government energy policies down to size.’

A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokeswoman said: ‘We welcome this contribution to the debate, and agree that stronger competition is the key to tackling energy bills.’
