Britain could be forced to hold European elections on Sundays as part of a blatant EU bid to erase our long democratic tradition.

For 72 years, elections to Westminster have been held on a Thursday, with local elections also being held on the first Thursday in May.

Proposals from the European Commission would see the UK having to fall in line behind most of the continent, where elections are held on Sundays.

The plan would force Britain to ditch its tradition of voting on a Thursday for the first time in seven decades

The plan, which would come into force in time for the 2014 elections for the European Parliament, is described as a step to cement further ‘political union’.

Would you rather vote on a Sunday, as Europe wants Britain to do, instead of a Thursday?

In addition, Britons would also have to sit through party political broadcasts on TV to encourage them to choose the next President of the European Commission.

The last time a British election was not held on a Thursday was in 1931 – in the midst of the Great Depression – when polling was on a Tuesday.

The last vote to be held on a weekend was 1918, when a Saturday poll – the first to feature women – was held in the aftermath of the First World War.

The proposal is contained in a European Commission discussion paper, the Daily Telegraph reported. It said: ‘A common European voting day with polling stations closing at the same time would better reflect common participation by citizens across the union and therefore is part of the representative democracy on which the EU is founded.’

The next Euro election is due in early June 2014. It had been expected that the voting dates would be between 5 and 8 June.

The UK would have expected to vote on Thursday 5 June, and there were plans in train to move the local election voting day from early May to 5 June to coincide with the European vote.

But instead, if the Commission gets its way, the UK would vote on Sunday 8 June.

There are fears that turnout could fall if the Euro poll was not held on the same say as the council elections.

Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, said: ‘We absolutely oppose a common voting day for euro elections and would be appalled if local elections were held on a different day.’

Aside from the UK, only the Netherlands vote on Thursdays. Ireland and the Czech Republic hold the euro vote on Friday.

Cyprus, France, Italy Latvia, Malta, and Slovakia hold the polling day on Saturday and all other 17 EU countries hold it on Sunday.

David Cameron may be forced to use his veto to prevent a change in the voting day.

The proposed plans also require Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat and UKIP party political broadcasts to ask voters to choose between candidates for president of the European Union’s Brussels executive during euro-elections next May.

The Commission proposal says: ‘European and national political parties should make known, ahead of the elections to the European Parliament, the candidate for the function of the President of the European Commission they support.

‘National political parties should ensure that their political broadcasts in view of the European Parliament elections are also used to inform citizens about the candidate they support.’

Ashley Fox MEP, Conservative spokesman on EU constitutional affairs, said: ‘There is no need for an elected President of Europe because there is no country called Europe. Only sovereign countries need an elected head of state, whereas the EU is an international organisation.’

The proposal includes the requirement that national parties must state their affiliation to European political parties, which are not well known in Britain or elsewhere in Europe.

Elections to the European Parliament in Brussels are to be held in June next year

‘National political parties participating in the elections to the European Parliament should make publicly known ahead of those elections their affiliation with European political parties,’ the proposal says.

‘National political parties should prominently display their affiliation with European political parties in all campaign materials, communications and political broadcasts.’

Under the Lisbon Treaty, the next president of the commission will be the candidate selected by the European political party with the most votes in the euro elections.

‘It would increase the legitimacy of the president of the commission and more generally, the democratic legitimacy of the whole EU decision-making process,’ says the proposal.

‘It could also contribute to raising the turnout for European elections by strengthening the link between the election of the representatives of the citizens with the selection and election process of the head of the European executive.’

Since the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, turnout has declined in each successive vote.
