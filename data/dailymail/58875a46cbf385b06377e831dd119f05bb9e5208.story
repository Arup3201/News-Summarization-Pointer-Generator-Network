Mark Newton attacked the former Hearts and Falkirk keeper Myles Hogarth (pictured)

A fire chief hit a former professional footballer with a baseball bat after discovering he was having an affair with his wife. 

Mark Newton, 36, attacked the former Hearts and Falkirk keeper Myles Hogarth, 38, as the footballer was leaving the club where he now plays.

Hogarth’s injuries included a bruised back, cuts on the head and a two centimetre scar on his face.

But Newton has escaped a jail sentence after Hogarth wrote to the sentencing sheriff.

Falkirk
 Sheriff Court was told that Newton had found out that Hogarth had been 
involved in a three year affair with Newton’s wife, Janet, 27.

Newton tracked the player down and attacked him with the baseball bat, repeatedly striking him on the body.

When
 Hogarth ran off, Newton, a crew commander with the Scottish Fire and 
Rescue Service in the training division at Falkirk, chased after him and
 repeatedly kicked him on the head and body.

The court heard that Hogarth 
didn’t want police involved but a member of the public witnessed the 
brutal attack and noted Newton’s car registration as he drove off before
 alerting police.

Beverly Adam, prosecuting, said police stopped Newton in his car 10 minutes after the assault.

He immediately blurted out: 'I hit a guy with a baseball bat. 

'He had been f*****g about with my wife.'

Today, Newton, of Grangemouth, appeared 
for sentence after pleading guilty to assaulting Hogarth to his severe 
injury and permanent disfigurement.

The incident occurred at Camelon Juniors’ ground in Fairlie Drive, Falkirk, on May 21 last year.

Newton’s solicitor, Gordon Addison, said: 'This plays out with the drama that happens on TV and this is no stranger than fiction.

'He is a normal hardworking citizen and family man who has snapped in this situation.

'The complainer has made his position clear from the outset that he had no interest in Mr Newton being charged or punished.

'He accepts some responsibility for this situation.

'Mr Newton has taken steps to make sure this won’t happened again.

'The master plan is to reconcile with his family.'

Sheriff John Mundy ordered Newton to pay £1,000 compensation to Mr Hogarth, but made no other order.

The sheriff said: 'You will appreciate this is a very serious case and it could have had much more serious consequences.

'Fortunately it was only this.

'I take into account your references, that you have no previous convictions, and that you have employment, and I have the letter from the complainer stating his position.

'All that has persuaded me in taking the unusual step of not imposing a custodial sentence or community payback order.

'I will instead impose a compensation order and that should be for £1,000.'

Falkirk Sheriff Court was told that Newton had found out that Hogarth had been involved in a three year affair with Newton¿s wife

Since the affair was exposed, Hogarth and his wife Jennifer have split and the family’s home in Falkirk has been sold.

Jennifer, 39, said: 'We have now separated.'

Newton and Janet, who married in 2007, have also separated.

Leaving court Newton, who was dressed in a smart black suit, said: 'It’s a bad situation - I don’t want to say anything more.'

Hogarth said earlier: 'I am aware of the case but I don’t want to comment.'
