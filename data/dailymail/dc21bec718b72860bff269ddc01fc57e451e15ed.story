Britain will be drenched with up to three inches of rain today with forecasters warning that many parts of the country could be in for an extremely soggy New Year.

The bad weather will continue throughout the weekend and into Monday with further heavy downpours tomorrow night. And with the ground already saturated forecasters warn there is a high risk of further flooding.

As many parts of the country remain underwater, there will be torrential rain in the south and amber alert storm warnings have been issued for parts of the North West.

This morning there we 81 flood warnings 
in place with a further 218 flood alerts issued. The Environment Agency 
has warned those travelling over the weekend should take extra caution.

Pockets of the UK have had to endure being cut off temporarily, with homes evacuated and residents forced to seek refuge elsewhere, while the country's public transport system has been badly affected.

Sally Webb, forecaster at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'Rainfall totals could exceed 50mm in the next 72 hours, but it won't all come today.

'Wales, south west England and Scotland will be the hardest hit areas.

'The rain is coming in bands and it is going to be pretty persistent during the day time today with more showers on Sunday, but it is Monday that's going to bring the most rain coupled with strong winds.

'It is looking to be turning a little bit more settled in around 10 day's time.'

She said the risk of flooding was high in some parts.

'The ground is so saturated from the rain we've had already and it is just going to have nowhere to go,' she said.

The Met office warned of 'intense 
downpours' with persistent wet and windy weather moving in from west to 
east and not clearing in some areas until well after dark. Sunday will 
see more showers with snow warnings issued for many parts of Scotland.

And yet another band of heavy rain is
expected on Sunday night which may linger in some parts of the south 
throughout New Years Eve.

However many parts of the country should at least have clear skies for their New 
Year's Eve fireworks, and from Tuesday onwards only occasional showers 
are forecast, with several dry days.

The Met Office has already confirmed 
2012 as the wettest year in England since records began in 1910 – and 
the threatened storms are likely to confirm it as the wettest for all of
Britain.

Less than two inches of rain is needed
for the record to be broken, remarkable considering much of the country
was in drought in March with huge swathes subjected to hosepipe bans.

And after heavy overnight rain, there will be further blustery downpours this morning.

Experts warn that the North West can expect up to three inches of rain, while other areas can expect up to an inch.

In the past 10 days, 520 properties 
have flooded across the country. High ground water levels have meant 
that even places such as Common Moor, near Liskeard – one of Cornwall's 
highest communities above sea level – have been put at risk.

Flood defences have so far protected 
more than 21,000 properties across England and Wales, including 4,000 
properties in Cornwall, while the Environment Agency's Floodline has 
received 28,000 calls.

Pete Fox, flood risk manager at the 
Environment Agency, said: 'We're urging people, particularly in north 
Wales and western England, to remain vigilant to flooding.

'If you're driving home this weekend, 
give yourself extra time to make your journey, check your route before 
travelling and avoid driving through floodwater.'

First Great Western said the main rail
line in the South West, which has been closed since before Christmas 
because of flooding between Exeter St Davids and Tiverton, is expected 
to reopen today.

Met Office forecaster Dave Britton 
said: 'Heavier rain will return on Sunday evening, with a new band of 
wet weather from the west. New Year's Eve will see further outbreaks of 
rain, but after a sodden day, the early forecasts are for the rain to 
clear in the evening.

'By midnight, there will be a few 
localised showers, but much of the country can expect a largely dry 
night. So it looks like good news for fireworks displays. But it will be
slightly chillier than previous nights, so people should dress up warm.

'Things are drier from midweek and it 
looks like we are going to get some respite in southern parts, where it 
is most needed. We should have a few days of mostly dry weather.'
