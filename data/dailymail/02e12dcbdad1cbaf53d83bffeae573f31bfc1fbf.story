After Tottenham fell to a 2-1 home defeat to Newcastle on Sunday, Sportsmail asked fans' blog SpursWeb what exactly is going wrong under manager Mauricio Pochettino. Joseph Meakin gives us 10 reasons why the former Southampton boss is finding it tough in north London.

Back in May I wrote for MailOnline Sport explaining how excited I was for the Mauricio Pochettino era to begin at White Hart Lane.

Nine games into the Premier League season, Spurs sit 11th in the table having suffered their worst start to a league campaign since Juande Ramos' infamous return of two points from eight games in the 2009-10 season.

Here is why it is going wrong for Pochettino so far.

Europa League hangover

Three out of our four league defeats so far this season have come after matches on Thursday in the Europa League. I really do not see this as a coincidence. 

Although Pochettino has often made wholesale changes to his starting XIs selected between the weekend and Thursday nights, mid-week journeys to the likes of Limassol and Belgrade cannot be helping our first team players' energy levels, even if they just sit on the bench.

Mentality and a lack of characters

Pochettino described Tottenham's problem as 'not tactical or physical', but to do with 'mentality' after Sunday's defeat to Newcastle. This suggests he is extremely frustrated with some of his players and and feels like they all have a lot more to give. 

With the likes of Sandro, Rafael van der Vaart, Lewis Holtby and Scott Parker leaving Spurs over the last few seasons, the squad does appear a little devoid of players with genuine passion for the club.

It is time for experienced heads like Emmanuel Adebayor, Hugo Lloris and Younes Kaboul to lead, inspire and play by example to try and inspire some of the members of the squad who are perhaps not quite performing.

Defensive weaknesses

Tottenham have conceded 13 goals in the league this season and this really is no surprise. Whilst captain Kaboul seems like a first-choice selection, it does appear that Pochettino doesn't know who his most suitable partner is. 

Federico Fazio, Eric Dier, Jan Vertonghen and Vlad Chiriches have all had a go next to Kaboul and have all looked pretty unremarkable. Pochettino needs to make a call, stick with a defensive pairing and bring continuity to the back line.

Injuries to Kyle Walker and Kyle Naughton, in addition to the inability of Ben Davies to break into the first team, have also meant we have been poor at full back. I feel like it is a matter of time before Ledley King comes in as a defensive coach.

Levy short-changing yet another manager?

The signing of Benjamin Stambouli is a puzzling one. Pochettino seemed pretty dead certain that he wanted Morgan Schneiderlin this summer, but instead a cheaper option at holding midfield was brought in. 

The same applies to Fazio – a much cheaper option to Mateo Musacchio, a defender Pochettino wanted. How can Levy expect good results when the boss doesn't get the players he wants?

Close the revolving door

Levy has continually allowed our best players to leave, this must stop. From Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov to Luka Modric and Gareth Bale, Spurs are very much a selling club.

The suits will point to the huge profits made on the that quartet alone, but what does it say about our ambition?

The big test next summer will be Hugo Lloris. Arguably the league's best shot-stopper - playing behind one of the leakiest defences – would fit in at any of Europe's elite teams. Let him go and once again Levy will be adding credence to the argument that the best are just don't want to stay at Tottenham.

Difficult fixtures

What must not be forgotten is that Tottenham have already played three out of last season's top four, with two of these games being away from home. We have also played bogey team West Ham – our early season fixture list has been very tough. 

With Aston Villa, Stoke and Hull to play next month, Pochettino has the chance to put a run together and should be targeting nine points.

New signings failing to impress the manager

Nearly a quarter of the way into the season, only one new signing has managed to properly force his way into the first-team for league games. 

Whilst Dier has been excellent, academy prospects Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb are preferred to Benjamin Stambouli. Fazio is in and out of the team and Davies cannot seem to usurp Danny Rose at left-back. Pochettino cannot be happy.

Misfiring strikers

Adebayor, who could not stop scoring under Tim Sherwood, has looked like a Championship player so far under Pochettino. Soldado has also failed to impress, and his penalty miss against City shows how low his confidence must be. 

I find it utterly bemusing that Harry Kane hasn't yet been given a chance in the league, and Pochettino really needs to give him an opportunity.

Negative atmosphere at White Hart Lane

Tottenham have the second most expensive tickets in the Premier League. The crowd expects entertainment for the prices they pay and atmospheres often become hostile and negative if things don't go to plan. 

Whilst White Hart Lane isn't quite as quiet as The Emirates, things do appear to be heading that way. Improvement needed.

Pochettino's philosophy taking time to work

Pochettino is a modern coach with modern ideas. It took half a season of foundation laying at St Mary's before his Southampton side took the Premier League by storm. Spurs fans do need to be a little more patient.
