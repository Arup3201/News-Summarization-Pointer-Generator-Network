Slated: The Apprentice contestant Alex Mills

He is the Apprentice contestant best known for his bizarre plucked eyebrows – dubbed ‘guybrows’.

But gravestone salesman Alex Mills has been accused of a shady business past which left hundreds of angry customers in his wake.

Meanwhile a former boss claims Mills ‘fleeced’ his company and stole his clients.

On the BBC show, Mills has been proud to boast of being just 19 when he set up Prestige Slate. The web-based business sold stone signs  and gravestones.

But hundreds of Mills’s customers said their online orders took months to arrive – or did not turn up at all.

Trading Standards in the Vale of Glamorgan, where Prestige Slate was based, confirmed they had received 146 official complaints since it was formed in 2010. Mills was a director of the company until January this year.

Cardiff-based Mills founded Prestige Slate after leaving  a job as an office manager at a stone and masonry business in the Welsh capital.

And his former boss, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He stole all my information, all my artwork, the pictures from my website and even a lot of my customers.’

He said Mills had ‘basically fleeced’ his business.

In a statement, Mills said:  ‘I dispute this serious allegation and will take this up with my former employer.’

Catherine Watts, a musician from Windsor, ordered  a sign from Prestige Slate in 2011 and said she had been ‘completely hoodwinked’.

She said: ‘I paid online and waited for it to arrive. I am still waiting two years on.

‘I hate the idea that so many people were taken in by this man and that he’s now on TV making out that he is a successful businessman.’

It was a sentiment echoed by 53-year-old Spencer Lyon, who spent £350 on a specially designed sign for his new home which took six months to arrive.

Swathes of other Prestige Slate  customers have taken to online forums to vent their frustration.Trading Standards moved against the firm under the Enterprise Act – which gives officials the power to require undertakings that ‘certain behaviours will not continue’.

Then an online contributor identifying himself as ‘The real Alexander Mills’ posted a lengthy rebuttal, claiming the postings had been fabricated by his disgruntled former employer, a claim that he denies.

Mills described Prestige Slate as  ‘a credible and brilliant business’  and added: ‘We were supplying over 10,000 bespoke orders a year to both the general public and prestigious  clients – which included the Royal Family, The London 2012 Olympic comity [sic] and more.’

Mills, 22, has often boasted to his fellow Apprentice contestants of his significant success as a businessman.

But accounts lodged at Companies House reveal the net worth of Prestige Slate was only £555 in 2011 and that the company had a modest annual turnover of about £28,000.

Mills stepped down as a Prestige director after transferring all his shares to a businesses partner, who now operates the company under a new guise, Premier Slate.

Mills is one of the final seven contestants in the ninth season of The Apprentice, battling to secure a £250,000 business investment from tycoon Lord Sugar.

Last night a spokesman for Mills said: ‘Alex Mills takes such allegations and complaints very seriously and is concerned that these have been made against a reputable company.

'During his time at Prestige Slate the company took 18,419 orders – and the average amount of complaints received during his time as director and part owner was less than one per cent.’
