It might make frying an egg a bit more comfortable but perhaps isn't great value for money.

This tiny flat, which has gone on the market for £804 a month in Ealing, west London, has a double bed in the middle of the kitchen.

It is described by Northfields Estate Agents as having a 'good sized living area' and also features a furnished 'large kitchenette', shower room and wooden floors.

However the online advert, which has since been removed, doesn't mention that the first-floor flat's kitchen also doubles up as the bedroom.

Instead it includes pictures of the flat, which measures 19 sq m, with a divan bed placed in the middle of the room - inches from work surfaces and the kitchen sink.

A wardrobe has been squeezed into the far corner of the studio flat while the dining area is conveniently placed on the other side of the bed.

According to the London Evening Standard, the advert read: 'Located moments from Ealing Common Station is this great sized self-contained studio apartment with all bills included.

Tight squeeze: The kitchenette is described as 'large' by Northfields Estate Agents on their website - despite not even having a proper oven

'Station Parade is conveniently located for all the shops and amenities of Ealing Common and Ealing Broadway.' 

It is one of hundreds of flats soaring in price in the capital - many of them costing more than entire homes in the north of England. 

Often grand Victorian or Edwardian townhouses are split into several shoebox dwellings on each floor, each with a tiny kitchen and shower.

Britain has the smallest new flats in western Europe, according to the Royal Institute of British Architects, and some are now even smaller than a Tube carriage.

Among some of them was a five ft square studio-flat in Islington, north London, which was marketed for £737-a-month and was snapped up in just 16 hours.But the council banned a landlord from letting it out after pictures emerged with the bed blocked a kitchen cupboard.

Council officers investigated after the listing in Islington, north London, was plastered over social media and attracted the attention of the press, and found it could not be rented in its current state.

Elsewhere a flat was advertised for £780 a month in the exclusive west London enclave of Chelsea last year - with two electric hobs squeezed onto a kitchen counter which ends about 1ft from the bed.

Another flat in Harringey, north London, solves the issue of storage by having its occupant climb a ladder to reach their mattress. But its price - at £607 a month, comparatively low for the capital - is still more than an average three-bedroom flat in Liverpool.

Last year a landlord also asked for £780 a month for a studio flat so small that occupants would have to stand on top of a fridge and climb a ladder to get into bed, and there was less than two feet of space between the top of the mattress and the ceiling.
