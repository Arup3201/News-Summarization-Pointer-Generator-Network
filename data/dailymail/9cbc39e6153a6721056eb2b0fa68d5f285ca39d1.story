The celebration of a lifetime went down in flames for one couple on Saturday night, after a fire broke out during the middle of their wedding, forcing the evacuation of over 140 guests and destroying a beloved Massachusetts venue.

The fire started around 7.15pm at the historic Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough, moments after the marriage ceremony concluded.

'I had literally just pronounced them husband and wife, and they proceeded down the center aisle with the groomsmen and bridesmaids (and) I looked up and saw some smoke,' Justice of the Peace Jerry Cibley told The Sun Chronicle.

'I initially thought it was the fog machine.'

Big day ruined by fire: Flames broke out in a Foxborough wedding facility just after a ceremony had been completed just after 7 pm Saturday. All wedding guests were evacuated from the Lakeview Pavilion before firefighters arrived on scene

Several onlookers said it appeared the fire started in some newly-applied mulch outside the building, which is surrounded by a lake and woods, but it quickly spread to the building itself.

'The bride and groom are devastated — this was their big day,' Cibley said.

'I’m thankful everybody got out safely. It went up so quickly and could have been a lot worse with 140 to 150 people in there.'

The couple have not been named after they wished to stay anonymous.

Reports that surfaced on Twitter said the Renaissance Hotel in Foxborough quickly organized a makeshift reception.

Firefighters battled the flames using water from the nearby lake, while scores of onlookers arrived at the scene to lament the loss of the 108-year-old landmark.

'Thank goodness the lake is there,' said Paul Hubrich, who lives down the road.

'It’s incredibly sad — thank goodness everyone got out okay.'

The facility first opened on July 4, 1906 as Lake View Park, complete with a dance hall pavilion, dining room, theater and bandstand, under the ownership of the Ross family, according to the facility’s website.

It changed hands several times over the years and was purchased by Efstathios 'Steve' and Kiparisia 'Kathy' Kourtidis in 1988, when it was known as Lakeview Ballroom.

The facility was renamed to Lakeview Pavilion and is managed by the couple’s daughters, Anastasia Tsoumbasnos and Natalia Kapourelakos.

The popular wedding venue had undergone renovations in recent years.

Patricia Kissinger, who lives down the road, said she felt badly for the owners.

'We heard a lot of fire engines and ambulances coming down the road and after 10 or so knew it was something serious,' she said.

'They just kept coming. It’s just so sad, this is such a beautiful, historic place. We all love it. And the owners have been so good to the neighborhood.'
