'Wow, that reminds me of my upcoming book 900 Dirty Socks Picked Up Off The Floor and Dining Room Chairs,' one wrote on Jezebel.com.

Another added: 'You people need to visit my blog: 1,000 Ironed Dress Shirts. It is just pictures of the 1,000 times I've ironed my husband's shirts.

'I am gonna [sic] be publishing it as a coffee table book, for ironing enthusiasts.'   

Despite the comments, Miss Smith has thousands of fervent followers.

She became an internet sensation this year when she outed herself 
as the as the author of the 300 Sandwiches blog that she started in June
 2012.

Moth-watering read: Random House's new offshoot, Zinc Ink, will publish a compendium of Miss Smith's sub recipes in time for Valentine's day, 2015

Her boyfriend, Eric Schulte, had been doing most of the cooking when she decided to intervene and show her 'future wife' potential.

'After
 I made him a sandwich - your basic turkey and Swiss cheese - one day 
for lunch, he told me, 'Honey, you’re 300 sandwiches away from an 
engagement ring,' she said, adding: 'To
 him, sandwiches are like kisses or hugs. Or sex.'

The anonymous blog launched shortly thereafter.

'When I reach my 300th sandwich, Eric and I will likely go all the way and have babies, so I'll need to know how to cook a variety of meals for my kids'

Miss Smith, who is likely to have been 
paid a six-figure sum for her yet-to-be published book, said she was
 at 197 sandwiches on Tuesday.

Past recipes include 'Lamb Sandwich with Fig Jam and Arugula', 'Egg and Tomato Jam Breakfast Sandwich' and a 'Chicken Meatball Sub'.

There are also sweet options from 'Chocolate Whoopie Pies with Cream Cheese Filling' to 'Pumpkin Whoopie Pies with Bourbon Creme Filling'.

Gossip website Gawker, previously branded Miss Smith 'deranged' for bowing to the stringent demands of her bossy boyfriend - he won't 
eat sliced avocado, broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, anything with the word
 'sprouts' in it, cauliflower, raw tomatoes, peas, kale, blueberries, 
raisins or olives.

However, she defended her behavior saying she is not 'desperate' and her blog is not 'sexist', as critics made it out to be.

Retaining an sense of optimism, she concluded: 'When I reach my 300th sandwich, I’ll have an arsenal of meals I can use for dinner, parties, picnics,  breakfast and desserts.

'And
 barring any major fights or infidelities, [Eric] and I will likely go all 
the way, buy that country house and have babies, so I'll need to know 
how to cook a variety of meals for my kids and house guests anyway.'
