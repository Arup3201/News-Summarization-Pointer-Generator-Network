An historic Grade II-listed house where Oliver Cromwell plotted a key Civil War battle has gone on the market for £800,000.

Cromwell and his right-hand man General Sir Thomas Fairfax met at Wickham Court in Bristol on the eve of the New Model Army’s attack on the city.

Hours later the Parliamentarians launched a raid prompting weeks of fighting which left hundreds dead and ended one of the Civil War’s longest sieges.

The 17th-century house holds few clues to the pivotal role it played - but does boast rubble facades and detailed carvings from the period.

A blue plaque on the side of Wickham Court records the meeting between Oliver Cromwell (right) and General Sir Thomas Fairfax on the night of September 10, 1645.

Before the night attack, the people of Bristol and surrounding towns had endured months of hunger and hardship after Sir Thomas and his troops cut off supplies to Royalist soldiers.

At 2am on the morning after the meeting, two cannon shots boomed out over the city to give the signal to attack.

After days of fighting, Royalist commander Prince Rupert was eventually forced to sign a treaty of surrender - a defeat which cost the lives of around 200 of his own soldiers.

With views out over a large walled garden and the picturesque River Frome, the spacious stone-built home includes a study, sitting room with a beautiful terrace and a drawing room.

It is being marketed by estate agents Hamptons after its owners restored the building under the guidance of English Heritage experts.

In an online listing for the home, estate agents said: ‘Wickham Court is an historic and important early 17th century former court.

‘Grade II listed, it displays a plethora of period charm typical of this building period and house of historic note.

‘Wickham Court is historically important as Oliver Cromwell and General Fairfax are believed to have held council in the rooms in 1645 before their march to Bristol.

Religious dogma: When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent

The Civil War was a series of battles from 1642 to 1651 between Royalists and Parliamentarians.

When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent.

His was a style of governance defined by religious dogma and a stubborn opposition to parliamentary rule.

This bred feelings of alienation and deep mistrust in pockets of England, while in Scotland tensions with the English boiled over into bloody conflict.

The embattled king was forced to form a parliament in 1640, and within this a vocal and highly critical Puritan faction began to grow.

When a violent Catholic rebellion broke out in Ireland, disagreements over how to respond split England in two, and in 1642 the English Civil War broke out.

The Royalists, based largely in the north and west, fought for the king, while the Roundheads, also known as Parliamentarians, came mainly from the south and east.

They took their nickname from their preference for closely cropped hair, which set them apart from the ringlets of courtly Royalists.

The battles that followed saw Charles's forces, bolstered by the Welsh and Cornish, clash with a Roundhead army swollen with Londoners.

The Royalists looked to be on the brink of victory in 1643, until their enemies joined forces with the Scots.

In 1644, the king's men suffered a crushing defeat at Marston Moor, North Yorkshire, effectively conceding the north. A further loss at Naseby, Northamptonshire, was the final nail in the coffin.

The king gave himself up to the Scots and they promptly passed him on to their Roundhead allies, who were in the early stages of establishing a republican regime.

He was executed in 1649, but not before inciting further clashes known as the Second Civil War.
