Harry Redknapp has made a secret dash to Malaysia as he plots Queens Park Rangers’ relegation escape.

The Loftus Road manager cancelled a proposed TV appearance on Wednesday night to fly to Asia to hold talks with owners Tony Fernandes and Ruben Gnanalingam.

It is understood the discussions centred around the club’s January transfer plans; with the issues of budget and potential targets central to the meeting.

Redknapp is due back in England on Thursday in time to head his side’s preparations for Saturday’s Barclays Premier League clash against West Bromwich Albion.

And his Malaysian mission is viewed as a major indication that Redknapp remains central to the QPR hierarchy’s blueprint this season.

Redknapp has been under heavy pressure at various junctures this season due to the club’s difficult return to the top-flight.

Monday’s defeat at Everton kept them in the bottom three, but Rangers have shown real signs of improvement under Redknapp in recent weeks.

And Fernandes is said to be more certain than ever that the 67-year-old is the right man to lead QPR to Premier League survival.

Furthermore, Redknapp’s trip to the Far East to discuss transfer issues is viewed as a strong statement of confidence from those within the corridors of power at Loftus Road.

Redknapp has placed a new centre-forward at the top of his transfer hit list next month, with Stoke striker Peter Crouch among his targets.
