Paul Scholes says Manchester United have not been good enough under Louis van Gaal so far, insisting a club of their stature cannot just play well and lose.

Writing in the Independent, the legendary former United midfielder admitted he was surprised by how 'subdued' Van Gaal has been in the Old Trafford dugout compared with the way he was at the World Cup while managing Holland.

And Scholes also made reference to United's inferior record at this stage of the season compared with the last under David Moyes - United have 13 points from 10 games after their defeat at the hands of Manchester City last weekend.

'The scoreline against City might have been more respectable than last season but the performance in the first hour of the game was very poor indeed,' said Scholes. 

'This is Manchester United. It is simply not good enough to play well for 20 minutes and lose.

'Louis van Gaal talks about progress. I expected United to have a better record by this stage of the season. Under David Moyes last season United had 17 points from their first 10 games. This time, having spent £150million in the summer, they have 13 points from 10 games.'

Scholes also says he has become worried about the apparent downbeat mood of the squad after their underwhelming start to the campaign, especially in the case of record signing Angel di Maria.

'My concern is that the mood among the United players feels a bit low-key,' he continued. 'Preparing for the broadcast of the game in Madrid this week, I watched re-runs of last season and Angel di Maria smiling broadly as he celebrated goal after goal with Cristiano Ronaldo. 

'He doesn’t seem to be in the same happy mood at United. It feels downbeat among the team.' 

Angel di Maria has appeared unhappy at  United compared to when he was at Real Madrid, says Scholes

Scholes added that the Dutch boss has appeared a completely different character to the man who led Holland to third place at the World Cup, and that it can be tricky at times to decipher his thought process during matches.

'It is difficult to figure out what Van Gaal is thinking during games,' explained Scholes. 'His demeanour doesn’t change throughout. He looks a bit subdued. Certainly, he appears very different to the man you saw on the touchline at the World Cup.'
