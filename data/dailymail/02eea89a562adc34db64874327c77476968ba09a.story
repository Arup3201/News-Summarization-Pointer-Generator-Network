A narrow three-wheeled electric vehicle could offer commuters the freedom to squeeze through traffic jams as if were driving a motorbike, while offering the stability and safety of being inside a car.

Toyota's i-ROAD personal mobility vehicle is designed for negotiating busy city streets and is no wider than a standard motorbike, but can be driven like a car thanks to intelligent front wheels that automatically adjust to suit the driver's actions.

The trike uses 'Active Lean' technology that allows its wheels to move up and down to calculate the best position for going round tight corners, or weaving in and out of traffic.

This makes the vehicle lean a little like a motorbike, yet the driver can operate the vehicle without noticing the automated technology to drive the vehicle like a normal car.

The i-ROAD could be the answer for people who like the idea of cutting through traffic on a motorbike, but like the creature comforts of their car. It seats two people under cover, is 'intuitive' to drive' and there is no need for a helmet, according to the company.

The Active Lean technology is the key to the vehicle's stability, safety and comfort,Toyota told Mail Online, as it offers a stable ride without the driver having to maintain the balance of the vehicle.

Part of Toyota's eco range, the i-ROAD prototype is electric and has a range of 30 miles on a single charge

The
 system uses a lean actuator and gearing mounted above the front 
suspension member, linked via a yoke to the left and right front wheels.

An engine control unit calculates the required degree of lean based on steering 
angle, gyro-sensor and vehicle speed information, with the system 
automatically moving the wheels up and down in opposite directions, 
applying lean angle to counteract the centrifugal force of cornering.

The system also operates when the vehicle is 
being driven in a straight line over stepped surfaces, the actuator 
automatically compensating for changes in the road to keep the body 
level. This means that if a driver tries to park the trike and rides up on a kerb, it will stay level.

A spokesman told MailOnline that anyone who can drive a car can 'jump in and drive the i-ROAD as there is nothing special to learn - you don't have to know how to drive a motorbike'

Part of Toyota's eco range, the prototype is electric and has a range of 30 miles on a single charge, which may not be a long distance, but the company believes this type of vehicle could serve as the main mode of transport for short urban journeys in the future.

The vehicle's speed can be limited to suit road laws for its class of vehicles. It can typically travel at up to 45km per hour (28 mph) but has a maximum speed of 60kph (37mph).

A spokesman told MailOnline that anyone who can drive a car can 'jump in and drive the i-ROAD as there is nothing special to learn - you don't have to know how to drive a motorbike' as the leaning motion happens automatically and while the driver experiences a 'different sensation' to driving a car, it is no different to operate.

He also said that the driver and passengers so not 'heave to one side' of the vehicle like when a car takes a corner a little too quickly.

Despite the vehicle being narrow, its smart, moveable wheels mean that drivers do not need to stabilise the vehicle when it is stationary - like motorcyclists putting their feet on the road surface at traffic lights.

Toyota believes its concept trike could play a role in reducing traffic jams and pollution in cities and is going to roll out its vehicles in Tokyo's Ha:mo urban transport system

applying lean angle to counteract the centrifugal force of cornering.

The system also operates when the PMV is 
being driven in a straight line over stepped surfaces, the actuator 
automatically compensating for changes in the road to keep the body 
level.

Because of this, the vehicle has a closed body with creature comforts such as lighting, heating, audio and Bluetooth.

Toyota said: 'People using this kind of vehicle want 
something that is more comfortable, offers better weather protection and
 is safer than a two-wheeler such as a scooter or motorcycle, but has 
similar benefits of low running costs, easy parking and around-town 
manoeuvrability.'

The i-ROAD is 2.35 metres long, 1.45 metres high but just 85 centimetres wide - similar to a motorbike - which Toyota said is handy for manoeuvring through congested traffic and allows four of the vehicles to be parked in a single parking bay.

The trike uses a lithium-ion battery to power its two 2kW motors mounted on the front wheels and emits no emissions.

Toyota believes its concept trike could play a role in reducing traffic jams and pollution in cities and is going to roll out its vehicles in Tokyo's Ha:mo urban transport system, which will combine different forms of public and private transport including electric car sharing and traffic routing in a large-scale trial.
