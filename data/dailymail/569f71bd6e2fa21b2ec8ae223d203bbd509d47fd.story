Sean Dyche fears football will go down the tube unless football’s rule makers introduce retrospective bans for cheating.

The Burnley boss  is fed up with players diving and getting away with it and wants new rules introduced to stamp it out.

Dyche, who was speaking at the Leaders Sport Business Summit at Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge, then followed Roy Hodgson’s example by travelling on the tube.

Roy Hodgson was spotted on the tube in 2012 and told passengers Rio Ferdinand's England career was over

He said: 'I would introduce retrospective bans for cheating.

'It's got to be looked at. Some dives are being applauded now. It's ridiculous. It's very, very difficult for referees.

'A striker can drop in the box and not get banned. It can decide results. Have a panel who look at it, get all the angles.

Dyche is keen to stamp out diving in football and wants retrospective bans introduced 

'It would cut it out very, very quickly. It would disappear because managers would say to their best players: 'I can't afford to lose you for three matches.'

'It used to be frowned on. Now it's weirdly accepted. It's almost applauded. But cheating is cheating.'

Dyche was pictured on a busy Tube by a commuter just as England boss Hodgson was back in 2012 when he was reported to have told fellow passengers that Rio Ferdinand’s England career was over.

They aren't the only managers to have an affinity with the London Underground.

Former Tottenham boss Christian Gross was famously pictured waving a Tube ticket at his unveiling in 1997.
