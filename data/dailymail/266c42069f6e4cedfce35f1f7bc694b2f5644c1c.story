Arnis Zalkalns, 41, is the prime suspect in the murder of Alice Gross and police have revealed he served seven years in jail for  murdering his wife

David Cameron has pledged to personally examine how the prime suspect for Alice Gross's murder got into Britain.

In a dramatic intervention, the Prime Minister promised to learn lessons from the case and consider whether better ways of sharing information on criminals between European countries could have helped.

He said he was 'sickened' by the death of the 14-year-old schoolgirl, who was last seen walking along a canal towpath in West London on August 28. 

CCTV cameras also picked out Arnis Zalkalns, a builder from Latvia, cycling along the same route 15 minutes later. Alice's body was found on a river bed four days ago.

Last month police revealed that Zalkalns, 41, had served a jail term in 1998 for murdering his wife and dumping her body. Despite this, he was able to come to Britain to find work in 2007.

He went missing a week after Alice's disappearance and has not been seen since. Police have admitted they have no idea where he is and are continuing an increasingly desperate search of buildings and parks in London for clues to his whereabouts.

They believe he might be being harboured by criminal gangs in the capital and the South East. But he may have left the country using a Latvian identity card.

The case has triggered calls for the EU to keep a database of criminal convictions so offenders can be easily identified at borders. Under EU freedom of movement rules, it is Britain's responsibility to spot those it deems a threat.

But the so-called Warnings Index for UK border staff is mainly used for anti-terror measures and does not contain routine information about criminals from the rest of the EU.

Latvian authorities did not alert Britain to Zalkalns' record as he was not considered a 'present danger' after serving seven years for his wife's murder. They only disclosed his background when asked by Interpol after he was reported missing.

He has previously been arrested in the UK for the suspected indecent assault of a 14-year-old British girl. Zalkalns was raised in Latvian capital Riga and worked on building sites and dockyards from the age of 16. By adulthood he had developed a penchant for chasing young, impressionable women.

Alice's body was found buried in the River Brent in west London, near her home in Hanwell, on Tuesday night

Speaking in Afghanistan, Mr Cameron said: 'It's a horrific case. Anyone with a daughter will have felt just absolutely sickened by what has happened and what that poor family has had to go through. I'll look at all the circumstances of the case, what lessons there are to learn, whether that's about sharing information or whether it's about the importance of keeping our country safe.'

British police failed to secure a European Arrest Warrant – meaning that even if the suspect was found overseas he could not be arrested – because Scotland Yard has so far not gathered enough prima facie evidence. Alice's body was found weighed down by logs in the River Brent, off the Grand Union Canal in Hanwell, west London. A post-mortem examination was inconclusive.

Police have announced a case review, focusing on the first few days after Alice was reported missing. Critics asked whether enough consideration was given from day one to the possibility that Alice might have been abducted or murdered. In addition, police were slow to link her with Zalkalns.

MPs will question Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders about the case next month.

Labour's Home Affairs Committee chairman, Keith Vaz, said: 'It is very concerning … The UK needs an updated warnings index … which would flag up whether a person has a conviction as they are attempting to cross the UK border.'

Tory MP Peter Bone said: 'The real problem is the issue of free movement from the EU … We can't have our own visa controls and actually let in people we want to let in.'
