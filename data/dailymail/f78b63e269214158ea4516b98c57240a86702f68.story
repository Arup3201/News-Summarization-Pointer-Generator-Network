Harry Kane scored with the final kick of the game as Tottenham fought back from two goals down to draw with West Ham.

Cheikhou Kouyate and Diafra Sakho gave the Hammers what appeared to be comfortable lead but Spurs fought back first through Danny Rose and then Kane.

Here, Sportsmail gives their player ratings. 

Tottenham captain Lloris makes a superb save from Enner Valencia to keep the score at 1-0

TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1) 

Hugo Lloris - 7

Kept Tottenham in the game with superb saves at 1-0 down and 2-0 down. The Hammers would have been out of sight had it not been for Tottenham's captain.

Kyle Walker - 5.5

Both opposition goals came from crosses down his flank. Still a long way off his best but attacked well late on. 

Eric Dier - 5

Poor positioning for the opening goal, failed to impress thereafter. Struggling to recapture his early season form. 

Jan Vertonghen - 5.5

Like most of his team, not his best game. Occasionally looked a little flat-footed when balls were played in behind him. 

Jan Vertonghen indicates he thinks midfielder Mark Noble deserves a second yellow card

Danny Rose - 6.5

Could have done better for Sakho's goal - called for offside instead of playing to the whistle. Did manage to score though, his goal riled up the crowd and sparked the comeback.

Ryan Mason - 5

Struggled to exert himself on the game against an impressive West Ham midfield

Nabil Bentaleb - 5.5

Against Arsenal, he and Mason ran the show but Song, Noble and Kouyate didn't afford them the same luxury. 

Andros Townsend - 5

Cresswell dealt with him well. Never got a chance to use his pace and was hauled off after an hour.

Danny Rose strikes to pull one back for Tottenham with 10 minutes remaining in the match in north London 

Mousa Dembele - 4.5

His error led to the opening goal and was subbed at half time. Even with the ending, probably not a day he'll look back on fondly.

Erik Lamela - 5.5

Could have easily been substituted at half time instead of Dembele. Did not justify Pochettino's decision to start him ahead of Eriksen.

Harry Kane - 7

Looked frustrated for the majority of the game but kept trying and was rewarded with a penalty and a goal late on. Great strikers can score even when fed on scraps, Kane did that today.

Subs: Eriksen - 6, Soldado - 5.5, Chadli - 6.

Mauricio Pochettino - 5.5

Tottenham were poor, the Argentine claimed after the match his team deserved more than a draw - they didn't even deserve that. 

Harry Kane missed the penalty but scored the rebound with the final kick of the game on Sunday afternoon 

WEST HAM (4-3-3) 

Adrian - 5

Should have done better for Rose's goal. Saved Kane's penalty late on but the rebound fell straight to the Spurs striker.

Carl Jenkinson - 6

Quiet game from the on-loan defender. Didn't have much joy going forward but solid defensively. 

James Tomkins - 6

Kept Kane quiet for most of the game, not much he could do about either of Tottenham's goals. 

Winston Reid - 6

Made a superb challenge on Kane in the first half to prevent a goal. Like Tomkins, not at fault for either goal 

Defensive midfielders Song of West Ham and Nabil Bentaleb of Tottenham during the second half  

Aaron Cresswell - 6.5

Good going forward, provided the assist for the first goal (his fourth of the season). Unlucky not to be on the winning side.

Alex Song - 6

Really solid performance for the first 95 minutes of the match. Dominated the midfield with his team-mates. But a rush of blood to the head in the final 60 seconds cost his team the win. 

Cheikhou Kouyate - 7 

Great performance from the 25-year-old. Scored a goal and dominated the midfield with Song.

Mark Noble - 7

Assisted the second goal and played well but could have easily been sent off. Substituted in the second half to avoid that eventuality and it is no coincidence that Tottenham's comeback began shortly after.

Enner Valencia - 6

Denied a goal by a brilliant save from Lloris and struggled to make an impact thereafter. Could have scored in the second half but Sakho chose not to square it for a tap-in. 

Stewart Downing - 6

Solid, if unspectacular. A Stewart Downing performance if ever there was one. Some nice passing, worked hard tracking back but nothing to get the crowd off their feet.

Diafra Sakho - 6.5

A confusing performance. His goal was brilliantly taken - a half-volley from a remarkably tight angel. All of his easier chances, however, he failed to take advantage of.

Subs: Cole - 5, Jarvis - 5.5, Collins 5.5. 

Sam Allardyce - 7

So unfortunate to only come away with a point, Allardyce got his tactics spot on but were undone by a bizarre goal from Rose and a late penalty.
