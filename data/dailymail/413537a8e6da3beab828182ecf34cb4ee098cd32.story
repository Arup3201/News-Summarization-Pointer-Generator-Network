Ben Asadollahi Zoje faces life in prison after he was caught allegedly trying to smuggle drugs into Australia

A 29-year-old British man faces life in jail in Australia for allegedly trying to smuggle drugs into the country, hidden among bath salts.

Ben Asadollahi Zoje appeared in a Sydney court on Friday where he was refused bail.

Police claim that the man was found with 2kg of MDMA - ecstasy - when he arrived at Sydney airport on Thursday from a flight originating in Abu Dhabi.

Customs officers who pulled Zoje aside were said to have found the drugs - in a brown crystallised substance - hidden in five tins of bath salts.

Chemical tests on the bath salts allegedly revealed the presence of ecstasy.

Zoje's father said he was 'shocked' by the charges, speaking to the MailOnline from Belgium.

'The biggest crime he's ever done is a driving offense,' he said.

'Oh my god, I am shaking.'

Zoje's father, who did not wish to be named, said the 29-year-old was in London three days ago and he was not aware his son had flown to Sydney.

Zoje works as a night club events promoter between London and Dubai.

Tim Fitzgerald, regional commander of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, said it was 'a particularly elaborate attempt' to get the drugs into Australia.

'Stopping drugs at the border is of the highest priority and ACBPS officers are always alert to people trying to illegally import drugs, no matter the concealment,' he said.

Zoje was handed over to Australian Federal Police who are responsible for dealing with alleged offences at the airport.

He was charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug.

Zoje will appear in court again on July 23.

Commander Wayne Buchhorn of Sydney airport federal police said authorities remained vigilant to prevent these type of drugs and other dangerous substances from being brought into the country.

The maximum penalty for smuggling a large amount of drugs into Australia is life in prison

'People bringing these drugs into Australia can be as creative as they like with their concealment, but the AFP and its partner agencies have a track record of identifying and adapting to trends, leading to arrests and disruptions,' he told Sydney's Daily Telegraph.

Police said the alleged drugs would be weighed to determine their exact weight and street value.

The maximum penalty for smuggling a large amount of drugs into Australia is life in prison.
