The England team are taking no chances with their security even while staying in the luxury Mandarin Oriental Hotel on man-made Brickell Key Island in Miami this week.

There are 17 security personnel guarding the players even though the hotel in the financial district of Miami is already well protected from intruders.

FA security chief Tony Conniford had only three assistants among the massive England party of over 70 who arrived in Miami on Sunday night.

But they are supported by a six-strong security team from the company who guard St George’s Park; the six have flown to America purely for their protection role in Miami.

In addition, the hotel employs another seven guards to look after the England party. The task force operates in shifts guarding the entrance to The players’ floors.

So the chance of Miami’s answer to comedian Simon Brodkin, whom Conniford bundled away at Luton airport, trying to gatecrash the team rooms is slim indeed.

James Milner reacted far better to questions about the spoof Twitter account @boringmilner than former BOA chief executive Andy Hunt intended to do about his Olympic Games parody Twitter, RandyShunt. Milner amusingly said he wished his foundation Twitter account had as many followers as the boring one.

Hunt had wanted to tell the media he found RandyShunt totally disrespectful until persuaded otherwise by his communications team.

Freddie Flintoff, who is due to make his dramatic T20 return for Lancashire on Friday, has given up alcohol for four months.

Flintoff, renowned as a big boozer from his drunken Ashes 2005 celebrations and The 2007 World Cup pedalo episode, has really cut down his drinking since training to be a boxer. Sports science advances have pinpointed alcohol as responsible for slowing recovery from soft-tissue injuries.

David Beckham is one of the world’s most popular sportsmen, everywhere it seems apart from Miami, where he wants to build a new stadium for his MLS franchise. Not only is there significant opposition from locals but even Miami Marlins baseball manager Mike Redmond started swearing this week when asked about Becks wanting to bring ‘soccer’ to the city.

Andy’s winter base

The England press conferences were held at The Four Seasons Hotel in Brickell - near the team hotel - whose state-of-the-art gym Andy Murray always uses as part of his winter training time in Miami.

Murray was so engrossed in a work-out there last December that he turned up late for his live interview before he won The 2013 Sports Personality of The Year.

This was also the location for the botched award ceremony the year before when Lennox Lewis missed his cue to hand over the third-place trophy to Murray.

And another famous tennis player, Caroline Wozniacki, has been working out at The Four Seasons this week.

The England players settling into their luxury Mandarin Oriental Hotel will appreciate the facilities and water views. But it’s a 25-minute taxi ride from Miami’s financial district to The South Beach party zone.

And the choice of hotel was connected with keeping players well away from the art deco fleshpots with no plans even for a night out.

However, music lover Leighton Baines was delighted to find Morrissey was staying in the England hotel and the full back had a long chat and a selfie photo with The Smiths frontman.

The second edition of Graeme Swann’s video diaries ended abruptly when England began losing Ashes Tests last winter. Sponsors Yorkshire Tea had to be compensated for the lack of content.

Yet England sponsors Vauxhall have signed up Gary Cahill for a daily video diary from Miami.

However, perhaps fortunately - especially if England start losing and judging by the content of Cahill’s first Miami episode - the diary will cease when the team arrive in Rio because of FIFA digital rights.
