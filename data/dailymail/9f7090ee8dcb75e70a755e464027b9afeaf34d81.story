A singer was lucky to survive after suffering a huge electric shock in the middle of his performance in front of thousands of fans.

Nolberto was mid-way through his band Alkala's song ‘Yo por tu amor’ (Me for your love) at a carnival in Ranchillos, Argentina, when he placed his hand on a metal pole.

Dramatic mobile phone footage shows him convulsing as the volts start to surge through his body.

Electrifying performance: Nolberto sings on stage with his band during an Argentinian carnival - so far so good

Bad choice: During the performance, Nolberto walks across the stage to grab hold of part of the set, to emphasize his lyrics

Sizzling show: As Nolberto grabs the metal pole, electricity shoots through his body and the shirt on his back even emits smoke as he is shocked

Smoke then starts to rise from his arms, and he collapses off the stage.

With the audience screaming in terror, security men rushed to his unconscious side.

After several minutes, Nolberto regained consciousness and, like a true professional, returned to the stage to continue the show.

‘Nothing like this has ever happened to me before,’ Nolberto, from the Dominican Republic, later told Diario La Provincia.

As the electric shock makes his body shake, Nolberto throws himself off the stage to avoid further injury

Recovering: The singer is helped up from the floor and aided out of the crowd by a member of security

Lucky shot: The performer says he knew he had to throw himself off the stage in order to avoid being electrocuted

‘What happened was that the stage was damp, and when I touched the metal I was shocked. So to stop myself from being electrocuted I had to throw myself off the stage,’ he added.

It might make the Argentinian singer feel a little bit better, knowing that he probably won't make the same mistake again.

Scientists at Oxford University have discovered a part of the brain that helps stop humans from making bad decisions.

While other parts of the brain keep tabs on how well decisions are working, this new region thinks over what we might have done instead.
