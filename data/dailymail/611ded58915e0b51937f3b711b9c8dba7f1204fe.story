A street cleaner fell through a hole in the ground as the pavement beneath it collapsed.

Council worker Kelvin London was shocked when the earth gave way while he was cleaning the pavement in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk this morning.

As big paving slabs gave way, the sweeper tipped on its side.

Mr London said: ‘It suddenly went down and tipped to one side.

‘When I got my senses together I was in a big hole so I got out quick as it was a bit worrying.’

The street cleaner managed to clamber out a side door, unharmed.

Officials from Norfolk County Council are now investigating what could have caused the huge hole to appear.

Gordon Laird, who lives on the opposite side of the street told the Norwich Evening News that he woke at 8am to see the sweeper being removed from the gaping hole.

He said: ‘When I got out of bed there was a big lorry outside my house with a crane on it, picking it out of the pavement. I didn’t know what was going on.’

Nigel Seago, Highways Area Manager, said: ‘Initial investigations indicate the subsoil below the pavement in this section of Northgate Street has been washed away. 

‘It is too early to pinpoint exactly what has happened here but once we have removed the paving slabs and undertaken further explorations we will have a clearer idea. 

‘Temporary traffic controls will be in place until the problem is fixed and the footway can be returned to normal use.’

Traffic lights have been set up to allow the council to investigate.

Last year a motorist got the shock of her life when her vehicle fell into a giant sink hole as she drove along a busy city street in Manchester, New Hampshire. 

The unnamed woman was making her way across an intersection when the ground opened up beneath her.

Her Ford Kia became stuck in the sink hole as water began shooting into the air, catapulting several large boulders out of the ground.

About 200ft of road at the intersection of North and Beech streets collapsed.
