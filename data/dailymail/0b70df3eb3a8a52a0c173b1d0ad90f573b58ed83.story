House Speaker John Boehner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton today threw their weight behind President Obama's campaign to win support for military 
strikes against Syria ahead of a vote in Congress next week.

‘I'm
 going to support the president's call for action, and I believe my 
colleagues should support the president's call for action,’ said 
Boehner, an Ohio Republican.

‘The
 use of these weapons has to be responded to, and only the United States
 has the capability and the capacity to stop Assad and to warn others 
around the world that this type of behavior is not to be tolerated.’

Mrs. Clinton issued a statement late in the day, after a hearing concluded in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which heard testimony from John Kerry, her successor at State.

'Secretary Clinton supports the President’s effort to enlist the Congress in pursuing a strong and targeted response to the Assad regime’s horrific use of chemical weapons,' a Clinton aide told Politico.

Eric Cantor, the number 2 House Republican, echoed Boehner hours earlier. He said: 'Understanding that there are differing opinions on both sides of the aisle, it is up to President Obama to make the case to Congress and to the American people that this is the right course of action, and I hope he is successful in that endeavor.'

Action: Obama delivered a statement to members of Congress including John Boehner and National Security Advisor Susan Rice at the White House today to continue his campaign to muster support for strikes against Syria

Clinton joined the well-worn train of Obama partisans Tuesday afternoon, throwing her support behind the president's proposal for limited military strikes

GOP backing: House Speaker John Boehner today announced his support after the meeting, saying: 'I'm going to support the president's call for action, and I believe my colleagues should support the president's call for action'

United front: Obama speaks flanked by the House leaders of the Democrats and Republicans - but many congressmen are still undecided

Boehner and Cantor spoke after a 
closed-door meeting at the White House today as the president ramps up 
his efforts to win support on both sides of the House and avoid the 
humiliation suffered in the UK where Prime Minister David Cameron lost 
the vote to go to war last week.

That
 vote will come a full two weeks after the administration conceded that a
 ‘red line’ Obama identified more than a year ago – involving Syria’s 
use of chemical weapons – had been crossed.

With support from the UK evaporating 
and France saying it will wait to act until the U.S. determines Syria's 
fate, the Obama administration is no longer calling for Bashar 
al-Assad's ousting - in public at least.

‘I
 think Assad must go – and I believe he will go,’ Obama said on March 20
 during a joint press conference in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

But in recent days his administration has been far less enthusiastic about throwing Assad out of Damascus.

Speaking
 in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, Obama said only that he was
 ‘confident we can hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of 
chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their 
capacity to carry it out.’

The strength of those military 
strikes, and the length of any resulting armed conflict, is on clearly 
Obama’s mind as he battles to convince a skeptical House of Congress and
 public who have little appetite for another drawn out conflict.

‘The
 key point that I want to emphasize to the American people,’ the 
president said Tuesday, is that ‘the military plan that has been 
developed by the joint chiefs and that I believe is appropriate is 
proportional.  It is limited.  It does not involve boots on the ground. 
 This is not Iraq and this is not Afghanistan.’ 

Ready to go: An F/A-18F Super Hornet prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Red Sea today. The Nimitz was due to leave the region but has been ordered to stay

Limited? The president has said that any military action in Syria will be 'limited' and not 'involve boots on the ground'

Gen. Jack Keane, a former Army Vice Chief of Staff, indicated Tuesday that Obama’s ambitions may be broader.

Speaking
 after talks with senators including Republican John McCain of Arizona, 
who emerged Monday in support of Obama’s plan after a personal White 
House briefing, Keane told BBC Radio 4’s Today program that ‘the 
president has decided to deter the use of chemical weapons but also to 
degrade military capacity of the Assad regime.

‘At
 the same time he has upgraded the capacity of the opposing forces,’ he 
added. ‘And it’s the opposing forces that hopefully would be able 
eventually to topple the Assad regime.’

Nancy
 Pelosi, the House minority leader, was at the meeting today at the White House and used her five-year-old grandson as a
 case for pushing towards war after the meeting. He was against war. She
 said she told him: 'He said, 'I think no war.' I said, 'Well, I 
generally agree with that but you know, they have killed hundreds of 
children, they've killed hundreds of children there. ' And he said, five
 years old, 'Were these children in the United States?' And I said, 'No,
 but they're children wherever they are.' She
 added: 'Humanity drew a line decades ago that I think if we ignore, we 
do so to the peril of many other people who can suffer.

‘We’re
 going to be asking for hearings and a prompt vote,’ the president said 
Tuesday. ‘And I’m very appreciative that everybody here has already 
begun to schedule hearings and intends to take a vote as soon as all of 
Congress comes back early next week.’

Three
 different national polls conducted in the past week indicate that 
Americans may not have the stomach for another round of military 
intervention in the Middle East, even if it's limited and doesn't 
involve ground forces.And the level of support for President 
Obama's plan has decreased with each successive poll, first by six 
percentage points, and then by another seven.In a Pew Research survey,
 just 29 per cent of adults asked between August 29 and September 1 said
 they would favor military air strikes against Syria 'in response to 
reports that the Syrian government used chemical weapons.' A 
near-majority of 48 per cent said they would oppose such missions.That 48 per cent number was the lowest among the three polls. A Washington Post/ABC News poll
 conducted during the same period found that 59 per cent of Americans 
oppose 'the United States launching missile strikes against the Syrian 
government.' Just 36 per cent said they were in favor of the strikes.And when NBC News polled
 the question of whether the U.S. should 'take military action' against 
Syria, 50 per cent said it should not. That poll registered 42 per cent 
support for military strikes, but it's the earliest of the three public 
opinion surveys.

Secretary
 of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey are scheduled to make the 
president’s case Tuesday afternoon before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee.

A top-secret and 
more candid briefing will follow Wednesday morning, before a noon 
hearing in the House featuring Kerry and Hagel.

Meanwhile,
 French president Francoise Hollande today said he would to wait for the
 US Congress decision on military action in Syria before deciding on any
 action France might take.

No
 doubt playing on the fears of lawmakers, Syrian strongman Bashar Assad 
warned that the middle East is a 'powderkeg and fire is approaching 
today' in an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro published 
overnight.

Proof: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad yesterday challenged the U.S. and France to prove he used chemical weapons. (Pictured with his British-born wife Asma Assad)

Into the darkness: Many members of Congress fear that strikes on Congress may suck the U.S. into an open-ended conflict like Iraq, Afghanistan or Vietnam

'You can’t only talk about what the 
Syrian response will be, but what could happen after a first strike. And
 no one knows what would happen', he said.

'Everyone will lose control of the 
situation when the powder keg explodes. Chaos and extremism will be 
widespread. The risk of a regional war exists.'

The dictator also challenged the U.S. and France to produce proof that chemical weapons were used to kill 1,429 - including 426 children - on the outskirts of Damascus.

Political
 handicappers agree that with the support of McCain and Lindsey Graham 
of South Carolina, two powerful Republicans, the U.S. Senate will easily
 pass a resolution authorizing Obama to strike against Assad.

Boehner’s
 support may push a resolution across the finish line in the House, 
although passage is by no means certain.  The president’s backers will 
have to overcome opposition from liberal doves and libertarian-leaning 
isolationists – many of whom are eager for payback over the president’s 
Obamacare health insurance overhaul  –  in order to prevail.
