The two young girls orphaned when their parents were killed in the French Alps massacre could be adopted by their aunt.

Fadwa al-Saffar wants to become the legal guardian of Zainab al-Hilli, seven, and her sister Zeena, four, whose parents and grandmother were gunned down in their BMW on a holiday to Lake Annecy on September 5.

Their father Saad al-Hilli, 50, mother Iqbal, 47, and grandmother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were killed alongside 45-year-old French cyclist Sylvain Mollier. The police investigation continues. A  motorcyclist seen by British cyclist Brett Martin leaving the lay-by shortly after the killings remains the prime suspect.

Murdered: The girls were left orphaned when their family, including father Saad Al-Hilli (left) were gunned down in the French Alps (right). Now their aunt is preparing legal proceedings to adopt them

In December, MailOnline reported relatives of the girls said they wanted to care for them, but they had been placed in foster care by Surrey County Council 'against their will'.

Their aunt Fadwa al-Saffar, who is Iqbal's sister, is now planning legal proceedings in the family court to become the pair's legal guardian, The Sunday Times has reported.

Their family are apparently unhappy the children have been placed with an English foster family, despite their Iraqi heritage.

Their great-uncle Ahmed al-Saffar said the girls were allowed just one-hour meetings with their aunt.

He said he believed social services' actions breach the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, which says the state is obliged to preserve a child's identity including nationality, name and family relations.

Al-Saffar said: 'Social services are depriving the girls of their culture, religion, language and family environment.'

The Sunday Times has reported that it understood a police officer involved in the case told a friend of the family that no one outside the immediate family had access to the children.

According to the paper, the officer said: 'Until the investigation is drawn to a satisfactory conclusion the girls' safety and anonymity are of paramount importance.'

Surrey County Council said: 'The welfare of these two little girls is of paramount importance to us and everyone knows this is an incredibly sensitive case. Our concern is to ensure the children are safe and well and suggesting otherwise is simply wrong.'
