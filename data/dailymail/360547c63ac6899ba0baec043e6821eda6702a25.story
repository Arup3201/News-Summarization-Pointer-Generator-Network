The derelict military bunker at the centre of a German officer's botched plot to blow up Hitler will be opened to the public as a museum.

The Wolf’s Lair, located in the Masurian woods in northeastern Poland, has been open to the public since the end of World War II, but mainly for much criticised paintball games or as an indoor shooting range.

It was one of Hitler’s key military headquarters during the war. But is most famous as the place Colonel Claus von 
Stauffenberg tried to kill the dictator by placing a briefcase bomb 
underneath the table during a staff meeting on July 20, 
1944.

The plan was to kill Hitler and replace him with a government which would negotiate a truce with the Allies, ending the war.

Having left the conference for a pre-arranged phone call, Colonel von Stauffenberg, whose fate was thrown back into the spotlight due to 2008 movie Valkyrie starring Tom Cruise, left the hut shortly before the bomb detonated.

However, a staff officer had moved the briefcase shortly after von Stauffenberg’s departure which saw Hitler protected from the blast and the dictator survived with minor injuries.

Von Stauffenberg was captured and 
executed alongside three conspirators and all their relatives were sent 
to concentration camps.

A total of 200 were executed as a result of the assassination attempt.

Four months after the bomb, Wolf's Lair was destroyed by the Nazi forces as the Soviet Red army advanced in 1945. Soon after it became a tourist attraction.

Nearly 70 years later, due to lax 
legislation, tours of the overgrown bunkers have been less informative 
than the Polish Government see fit and tourists can even pose for 
photographs in Nazi uniforms.

‘At this moment, one does not feel the tragic dimension of this place,’ historian Tomasz Chinciski told The New York Times.

He is involved in the development of Wolf's Lair and underlines the importance of not forgetting its past.

He said: 'We need to work on new ways of telling history to make young generations want to learn it and understand it.'

The
 current lease of the premises is held by Wolf’s Nest, who have had the 
contract since the collapse of Poland’s communist regime.

Critics have called their tours of Wolf’s Lair a 'grotesque Disneyland’ operation and have called for them to stop.

In a bid to profit from ‘Nazi 
tourism’, Wolf’s Nest, a private company, built a restaurant, a hotel 
and even an indoor shooting range located in the offices of General Alfred 
Jodl, a Nazi Army Commander sentenced to death at Nuremberg.

But due to the remote location, Wolf’s 
Nest have not had much success in luring tourists to the bunker and the 
600-acre complex is in despair with overgrown buildings and pathways.

In an effort to re-build the bunker, Wolf’s Nest have agreed to work with historians, according to The Independent.

Poland’s
 Ministry of Culture and National heritage gave strict instructions to 
the company that no new lease would be granted unless the company meet 
educational requirements.

The
 hideout - whose name references Hitler's nickname, 'Herr Wolff' - 
consisted of 80 buildings at its peak including its own power plant and a
 railway station.

The complex, built in 1940, was heavily camouflaged and surrounded by a minefield, which took ten years to clear after the war.
