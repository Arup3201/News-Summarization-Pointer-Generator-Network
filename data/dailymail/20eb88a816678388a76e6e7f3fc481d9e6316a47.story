For most people, riding the world's best rollercoasters is a real treat. But for thrill-seeker John Cooper, it's all in a day's work. 

The 30-year-old is a professional theme park ride tester - and rakes in £20,000 a year testing up to 100 rides a day.

Mr Cooper can spend up to ten hours a week test-driving the dozens of rides and attractions at Drayton Manor theme park in Staffordshire.

But while the stomach-churning job definitely has its up and downs, Mr Cooper, from Tamworth, says that testing rides is his 'dream job' and has no plans of quitting anytime soon.

John said: 'Having worked at the park for a number of years in every department, I worked really hard to be promoted to this dream position.

'I don't think any other job could compare to this, it certainly wakes me up each morning.'

The guest services manager, who says his favourite ride at the park is Air Race, has been testing rides since 2009 after he was promoted to the position by park bosses. 

From the child-friendly Thomas the Tank Engine ride to the gut busting Apocalypse rollercoaster, John is tasked with making sure all the rides at Drayton Manor theme park are safe  before customers use them

From the child-friendly Thomas the Tank Engine ride to the gut busting Apocalypse rollercoaster, John is tasked with making sure all the attractions at the park are safe and operational before customers use them.

He said: 'My main challenge is ensuring that guests have the best possible day out, so testing the rides each morning enables me to see the park through their eyes.

'It's all about making sure everything is the best it can be, from checking the ride area is clear and clean, to checking the views on the way round.'

But despite his joy at landing the role, John has had his fair share of spills to go along with the constant thrills he experiences on a daily basis.

He said: 'One time, I thought my first port of call for the day would be testing the children's rides, so made the mistake of eating a fairly hearty breakfast.

'The schedule ended up being changed last minute and first up was Maelstrom instead - one of our most vomit-inducing rides.

'Needless to say I instantly regretted my choice of breakfast and although I managed to keep my cool on the ride, the aftermath wasn't pretty.

'It's safe to say I never made that mistake again, but it's an occupational hazard.'

It was in July this year that a Dutch tourism company advertised for a rollercoaster tester to compare the UK’s best rides.

Website Uitmetkorting.nl wanted to recruit someone to test more than 50 rollercoasters across eight of the UK’s biggest theme parks, including Thorpe Park, Flamingoland and Alton Towers.

In return, the winning applicant was required to film the rides on a small camera or smartphone before filling in a checklist ranking the rides.
