The  gun enthusiast who nearly killed his small town's police chief last week is a free man since cops couldn't find enough evidence to charge him and keep him behind bars.

Sentinel, Oklahoma Police Chief Louis Ross was shot four times that morning while raiding a house in connection to a bomb threat at a school, and only survived thanks to a bullet-proof vest he borrowed at the last minute.

Since he hasn't been officially charged, police have refused to officially name the man who shot Chief Ross, but the town's mayor has identified him as resident Dallas Horton. 

Before it was taken down, a Facebook page appearing to belong to Horton was littered with racially-charged posts making his shooting of African-American Ross even more sensitive.

Police say a man claiming to be Horton called 911 early Thursday, saying there was a bomb set to detonate at the Community Action Center, where the Sentinel Public Schools has their head start program. However, an analysis of the call later revealed that the call did not originate from Horton's home. 

Chief Ross and two Washita County Sheriff's deputies didn't know about the call's origins when they went to Horton's home to investigate the threat around 6am. 

The humble white house on South 4th Street that Horton shares with wife Esther Marie boasts signs that say 'certified zombie killer' and 'warning zombies inside enter at your own risk'. 

Who made the call? Ross and two deputies with the Washita County Sheriff's Office were investigating a bomb threat against a local school. Earlier that morning a man claiming to be Horton called 911 to say a bomb had been planted at a local community center. Above, Horton's home

Since Chief Ross's bullet-proof vest was currently getting repaired, he had to borrow a spare from a sheriff's deputy before entering Horton's home. 

Thankful: The police chief's wife Mary Ross (pictured) said her husband's bullet-proof vest was out for repair when he got the call to investigate Horton. She says she's eternally grateful to the deputy who lent his vest to her husband and saved his life

It was a good thing he did too, since Horton shot him three times in the chest and once in the arm upon entering. 

Chief Ross's wife Mary says she's eternally grateful to the deputy who gave his vest to her husband, and saved his life. 

'He allowed my husband to come home tonight,' Mrs Ross told KOCO. 'Had he not had that vest, my husband would not be here tonight.'

Chief Ross was rushed to Hobart Hospital where he was treated for his minor injuries and released. Mrs Ross says her husband has bruises where the vest shielded the bullets.

Horton and his wife were arrested in the aftermath, and he later told investigators that he didn't know  police  were breaking into his home, which Chief Ross finds skeptical. 

'Don't know what he heard or didn't hear, screaming from five officers of the law announcing our presence, requesting to see hands,' Ross told KWTV. 

A family friend of the Hortons defended Dallas, to News on 6. 

'He thought he was protecting his home and his wife. He didn't know what was going on until the door was busted down. And you have a right to protect your family and that's what he was doing.' 

Despite finding seven firearms and a explosive device in Horton's home, police say they didn't have enough evidence to charge him and he was released from jail later that day. 

Sentinel's Mayor Sam Dlugonski has known  Horton his whole life and described him to the Oklahoman as a 'gun enthusiast' and 'survivalist', adding that he seemed 'on edge'.  Horton's neighbor David Delk gave much the same description, saying he had a general mistrust of government, was unfriendly to neighbors and wore mostly black clothing.

Social media: A Facebook profiled believed to belong to Horton showed several racially-charged posts around the time of the bomb threat . It has since been taken down

Hobbies: Locals who know Horton, including the mayor of Sentinel, have described him as a gun enthusiast and survivalist  

Before the page was taken down, Horton's Facebook confirmed these interests in firearms with several images of himself holding up rifles. 

Around the time of the reported bomb threat, Horton was up posting about fear that Sharia law would spread to America. In another post he compared the U.S. to Nazi Germany and in another he criticized the White House sent officials to Michael Brown's funeral (who he called a thug) and none to Paris after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, according to Gawker.

And the racially-charged posts didn't end there. According to Raw Story,  he also reposted an image of a blood-spattered truck which read: 'JUST DROVE THROUGH FERGUSON. DIDN'T SEE ANY PROBLEMS.  

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation continues to look into the incident. 

Meanwhile, Chief Ross will be travelling to Oklahoma City to meet with an orthopedic surgeon about his recovery, and feels lucky to be alive.
