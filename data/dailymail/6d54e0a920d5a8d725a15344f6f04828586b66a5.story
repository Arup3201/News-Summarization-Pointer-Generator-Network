Now the worst excesses of snowstorm Nemo have descended, the fun can begin.

The blizzard caused havoc by dropping up to three feet of snow on the north-eastern U.S. But the recovery has now started in earnest.

Many residents are releasing their tension through snowball fights and playing in the powder. Across the region, families and friends threw snow at each other, went sledding and built igloos.

There is plenty of the white stuff remaining. On Sunday, some residents were just starting to dig themselves out of their inundated homes. And there is still a long way to go to return to normality.

Emergency crews and residents began to clear roadways and sidewalks after the storm that rampaged through the Northeast.

Municipal
workers from New York to Boston labored through the weekend in 
snow-bound communities, where some motorists had to be rescued after 
spending hours stuck in their cars.

President Barack Obama declared a state 
of emergency for Connecticut, allowing federal aid to be used in 
recovery, and utilities in some hard-hit New England states predicted 
that the storm could leave some customers in the dark for days.

About 345,000 homes and businesses were without power Sunday morning, down from a peak of about 650,000.

'We've never seen anything like this,' 
said county official Steven Bellone of New York's Long Island, which got
more than 2 1/2 feet of snow.

Some school districts announced they'd be closed Monday, complicating parents' back to work schedules but giving kids another day for frolicking.

At least 11 deaths in the U.S. were blamed on the snowstorm, including an 11-year-old boy in Boston who was overcome by carbon monoxide as he sat in a running car to keep warm while his father shoveled Saturday morning.

That death and the illnesses of several others exposed to carbon monoxide set off a flurry of safety warnings from public officials.

Roads across the Northeast were impassable and cars were entombed by snow drifts on Saturday. Some people found the snow packed so high against their homes they couldn't get their doors open.

'It's like lifting cement. They say it's 2 feet, but I think it's more like 3 feet,' said Michael Levesque, who was shoveling snow in Quincy, Massachusetts, for a landscaping company.

In Providence, where the drifts were 5 feet high and telephone lines encrusted with ice and snow drooped under the weight, Jason Harrison labored for nearly three hours to clear his blocked driveway and front walk and still had more work to do.

Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee cautioned that while the snow had stopped, the danger hadn't passed: 'People need to take this storm seriously, even after it's over. If you have any kind of heart condition, be careful with the shoveling.'

Blowing with hurricane-force winds of more than 80 mph in places, the storm hit hard along the heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor between New York City and Maine.

Milford, Connecticut, got 38 inches of snow, and Portland, Maine, recorded 31.9, shattering a 1979 record. Several communities in New York and across New England got more than 2 feet.

Still, the storm was not as bad as some of the forecasts led many to fear, and not as dire as the Blizzard of '78, used by longtime New Englanders as the benchmark by which all other winter storms are measured.

'Considering the severity, of the storm, the amount of snow and the wind, we've come though this pretty well,' Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation.'

Boston got up to 2 feet of snow, according to the National Weather Service. The 14.8 inches that fell Saturday alone broke the city's record for of 12.4 inches in a single day, set in 1994. Bradley Airport near Hartford, Conn., got 22 inches, for the No. 2 spot in the record books there.

Concord, New Hampshire, got 24 inches of snow, the second-highest amount on record and a few inches short of the reading from the great Blizzard of 1888.

In New York, where Central Park recorded 11 inches, not even enough to make the Top 10 list, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city 'dodged a bullet' and its streets were 'in great shape.'

The three major airports serving the city - LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark, N.J. - were up and running by late morning after shutting down the evening before.

Most of the power outages were in Massachusetts, where at its peak more than 400,000 homes and businesses were in the dark. In Rhode Island, a high of around 180,000 customers lost power, or about one-third of the state.

Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island imposed travel bans to keep cars off the road and let plows do their work, and the National Guard helped clear highways in Connecticut, where more than 240 accidents were reported.

The Guardsmen rescued about 90 people, including a few who had hypothermia and were taken to hospitals.

On Long Island, hundreds of drivers spent a cold and scary night stuck on the highways. Even snowplows got bogged down or were blocked by stuck cars, so emergency workers used snowmobiles to try to reach motorists, many of whom were still waiting to be rescued hours after the snow had stopped.

Richard Ebbrecht, a chiropractor, left his office in Brooklyn at 3 p.m. on Friday and headed for home in Middle Island, N.Y., but got stuck six or seven times on the Long Island Expressway and other roads.

'There was a bunch of us Long Islanders. We were all helping each other, shoveling, pushing,' he said. He finally gave up and settled in for the night in his car just two miles from his destination. At 8 a.m., when it was light out, he walked home.

'I could run my car and keep the heat on and listen to the radio a little bit,' he said. 'It was very icy under my car. That's why my car is still there.'

Local police said Sunday that all known abandoned cars were searched and no one needing medical help was found. But A 27-mile stretch of the expressway remained closed in both directions so crews could remove snow.

Around the New York metropolitan area, many victims of Superstorm Sandy were mercifully spared another round of flooding, property damage and power failures.

'I was very lucky and I never even lost power,' said Susan Kelly of Bayville. 'We were dry as anything. My new roof was fantastic. Other than digging out, this storm was a nice storm.' As for the shoveling, 'I got two hours of exercise.'

Across much of New England, streets were empty of cars and dotted instead with children who had never seen so much snow and were jumping into snow banks and making forts. Snow was waist-high in the streets of Boston.

Plows made some thoroughfares passable but piled even more snow on cars parked on the city's narrow streets.

Boston's Logan Airport resumed operations Saturday, and limited train and bus service in the metro area was set to resume Sunday afternoon. Authorities hoped to restore most service for Monday.

Life went on as usual for some. In Portland, Karen Willis Beal got her dream wedding on Saturday - complete with a snowstorm just like the one that hit before her parents married in December 1970.

'I have always wanted a snowstorm for my wedding, and my wish has come true to the max,' she said.

Some spots in Massachusetts had to be evacuated because of coastal flooding, including Salisbury Beach, where around 40 people were ordered out.

One concern going forward was a forecast for rain Monday in New England. While warmer temperatures might begin melting snow, the rain on top of snow already piled up on roofs could pose a danger of collapse.

'We are encouraging people as they can do so safely to use snow rakes and so forth to move the snow off of their roofs,' Patrick said.
