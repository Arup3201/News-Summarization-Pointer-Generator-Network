The mother of the 'Ikea monkey' has ended her custody battle to get him back from an animal sanctuary.

Yasmin Nakhuda will not appeal a judge's decision to place monkey Darwin with Story Brook Farm Primate Sanctuary (SBFPS).

Nakhuda has said that steep legal fees, along with little chance of success left her with no choice but to give up her quest for ownership of the monkey, The Globe and Mail reports. The court ordered Nakhuda to pay a costs award of $83,000, in addition to her own legal costs.

Darwin, a Japanese snow macaque, received worldwide attention after he escaped from Nakhuda's car in an IKEA parking lot in December 2012 and was photographed wearing a shearling jacket.

The monkey was then seized by animal services and sent to Stony Brook, prompting the dispute between Nakhuda and the sanctuary.

The legal battle for custody of Darwin has been heated -- the June 2013 trial heard that Story Brook founder Sherri Delaney received death threats from Nakhuda's supporters, according to The Toronto Star. 

Nakhuda purchased Darwin from an exotic animal dealer after watching a video of a different Japanese snow macaque waiting on a table in a restaurant, the website says.

On a Facebook support page for Darwin, Nakhuda said she had 'no regrets' regarding her battle for ownership of the monkey.

'We've faced ridicule, insults and our work and health suffered but we never relented out of pure selfless love,' she said. 'We have no regrets. None whatsoever.'

She also said that his fan page will not be taken down from the social media website.

'DDM Facebook page WILL REMAIN and in fact shall thrive,' she said.  'It will be Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary's reminder that they have mere "possession" of Darwin but can never own him as Darwin is ours and will always remain ours in our heart, mind and soul. They will NEVER take this away from us.'

In a statement on its website, the Story Brook sanctuary said it was 'pleased' with Nakhuda's decision.

'In September 2013, an Ontario Superior Court judge ruled that Darwin is a wild animal, and based on case law, Ms. Nakhuda lost ownership once he escaped from her car,' it says. 

'Over the past 15 months, we have incurred numerous expenses as a result of Ms. Nakhuda’s lawsuit [...]  and the payment by Ms. Nakhuda of the costs award made in SBFPS’ favour has allowed us to pay off those expenses,' it adds. The remainder of the award was reportedly split with Kevin D. Toyne, who worked as a pro bono retainer on the case.

The sanctuary also says that because Darwin was raised in a human home, he is only now 'slowly but surely learning to be more monkey than human.' The monkey, they say, now grooms one of his neighbors and and has learned to imitate other monkey's vocalizations. 

Nakhuda was ordered by a court to pay a $83,000 costs award in addition to her own legal costs
