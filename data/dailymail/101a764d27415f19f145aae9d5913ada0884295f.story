Unaware: Leanne Atherton said she didn't understand the serious risks involved when she started using tanning beds regularly at the age of 17

A 25-year-old woman is fighting skin cancer after using sunbeds for eight years in an effort to 'look good'.

Leanne Atherton said she was not fully aware of the risks of using tanning beds and was spending up to 20 minutes a week on them.

She was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in June and has had a lymph node biopsy to find out if the cancer has spread.

Ms Atherton started using sunbeds when she was 17 because she didn't like the look of her pale skin.

Since then, she has been topping up her colour with regular trips to tanning salons, which she said became an addiction,

'A tan is part of looking good. And I 
think it's addictive as well. You get used to seeing yourself with a tan
and when it starts to fade you go and top it up.

'There would be times I would pay for a 42-minute course and you would have to use them within the month.

'I
now know that is a lot of time to spend on a sunbed in just four weeks.
And having my skin type, with fair skin, blue eyes and having a lot of 
moles means I should not have been using them at all.'

Research has shown using sunbeds increases your risk of skin cancer by up to 75 per cent.

The Health and Safety Executive advise people with fair skin and moles 
not to use them at all because of the risks involved.

It is illegal for anyone under the age of 
18 to use sunbeds, but Ms Atherton says checks aren't made to ensure people know about the risks involved.

'I had heard that sunbeds posed a risk of skin cancer, but I didn't really understand just how much.

'In eight years of using them I was never once asked to fill any forms in or questioned about my skin type or my age.

Appearances: Ms Atherton said she topped up her tan because it is part of 'looking good' and she didn't like being fair-skinned. At no point was she asked about her pale skin or moles when she visited tanning salons

Killer: Using sunbeds increases the risk of skin cancer by up to 75per cent. People like Ms Atherton - fair, with blue eyes and some moles, are advised to avoid tanning beds entirely

'I just wish that I had been told more about the risks associated with them.'

Leanne has urged other visitors to 
tanning salons to research the dangers involved before they choose to use sunbeds.

'I would just urge people to read up
on skin cancer and make sure they're informed about the risks before 
they make a decision. I think salons have a responsibility in that 
regard as well.

'For me, no 
tan is worth the pain of an operation, scarred skin and the constant 
feeling of 'what if' while waiting for my results.'
