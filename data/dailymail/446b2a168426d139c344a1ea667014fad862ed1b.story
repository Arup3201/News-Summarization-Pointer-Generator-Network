Team news

Everton 

Everton will assess the fitness of two former Chelsea strikers, Samuel Eto'o and Romelu Lukaku, prior to the Londoners' visit to Goodison Park in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday.

Eto'o has been short of match fitness, having only joined the club this week, while Lukaku has had a toe injury. Another player with Chelsea connections, on-loan winger Christian Atsu, cannot face his parent club.

Midfielder Steven Pienaar (groin) is definitely missing but midfielder Darron Gibson is still pushing to return after 10 months out. Midfield duo Ross Barkley (knee) and Bryan Oviedo (leg), and striker Arouna Kone (knee) remain sidelined.

Provisional squad: Howard, Robles, Coleman, Hibbert, Distin, Jagielka, Stones, Baines, Alcaraz, Barry, McCarthy, Osman, McGeady, Besic, Naismith, Mirallas, Lukaku, Eto'o.

Chelsea 

Summer signing Diego Costa is a big doubt for Chelsea's Premier League clash with Everton on Saturday.

The 25-year-old forward has missed the previous two days of training with a minor muscular injury and will be assessed on Friday afternoon.

Ground to a halt: Diego Costa's good start to the season for Chelsea has taken a setback due to a muscle injury

Jose Mourinho has to make a decision on whether to include Fernando Torres amidst speculation over his future, while goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois could again be selected ahead of veteran Petr Cech.

Provisional squad: Courtois, Cech, Ivanovic, Terry, Cahill, Zouma, Azpilicueta, Luis, Fabregas, Hazard, Oscar, Matic, Ramires, Mikel, Willian, Schurrle, Costa, Torres, Drogba

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Everton have won four of their last five Barclays Premier League home games against Chelsea.

Since the 2009-10 season, Chelsea have lost four times to Everton; only Manchester City (5) have beaten them more often in that period.

If games had ended at half-time this season Everton would be top, Chelsea fifth.

If games just encompassed the second half then Everton would be bottom with zero points.

Chelsea have conceded just nine goals in 2014, fewer than any other ever-present PL side.

Proving a point: Steven Naismith scored the winning goal on half-time during the sides' last Goodison Park meeting, as Everton defeated Chelsea 1-0 last September

Everton new boy Samuel Eto’o scored nine Premier League goals for the Pensioners in 2013-14 but all of them came at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea have not lost their third game of the season since succumbing 2-0 to Middlesbrough in 1995.

Diego Costa has had two shots on target this season and scored with both.

Cesc Fabregas has assisted at least one goal in his last four Premier League appearances (five assists overall), a personal record for the Spaniard.

Eden Hazard has embarked on more dribbles than any other Premier League player this season (22 – eight more than any other player).
