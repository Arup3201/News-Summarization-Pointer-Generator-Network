With a level of detail usually reserved for globes in a classroom, it's hard to believe these replicas of Earth and Jupiter are completely edible.

Rhiannon Michell, 26, created the planet cakes complete with core, mantle and crust after her school teacher sister, Sarah, asked her to make a delicious science model for her class to enjoy.

The food blogger from Melbourne, Australia, baked the first layer of cake mix and allowed it to cool before placing it inside a bigger batter mix to make the second layer of sponge.

This was then baked again and Ms Michell repeated the process a third time and was left with three layers of sponge cake.

The inner layer of the Earth cake was an almond butter cake, the middle layer was lemon Madeira sponge and the outer layer was orange Madeira sponge.

'At first I was fairly sure there was no way I could make it, but then my inability to admit defeat kicked in and I had to find a way to do it,' said Ms Michell.

'So far I've made two planet cakes, starting with Earth. I have plans to make more, with one hopefully just around the corner.

'I'm hoping one day I will be able to tick off all the planets and their satellites.'

Using butter, flour, eggs and sugar, Ms Michell spent three days creating these mind-blowing sponge cakes, which measure 30cm in diameter.

She said: 'I have one really tiny and terrible oven, so I have to work on one half sphere at a time and glue them together using a fondant.'

For Jupiter, the inner layer was mudcake, followed by almond butter cake and then vanilla Madeira sponge.

She then used a tiny brush to paint the planets' distinctive features using food colouring.

She says: 'With Jupiter, the painting alone took me about eight hours. Getting all the detail in is really time consuming, but it feels worth it at the end.

'When people see my cakes, the most common response is that they look too nice to cut into. For me, seeing it eaten is the best part.

'The Earth cake was absolutely demolished by the school kids, and Jupiter was eaten by my family.

'I have this ever growing list of cake plans in my head, and never enough time to make them.

'My love of baking was mostly driven by wanting to be able to impress my boyfriend with amazing food, but I also can't deny the huge impact MasterChef has had on my passion for cooking.'
