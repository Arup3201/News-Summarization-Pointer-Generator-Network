Cyle Warren Abbott Jr, 23, demanded cash from the gas station, but returned three hours later to apologise and hand himself in

A 23-year-old man robbed a gas station with a loaded BB gun before returning three hours later with the money to apologise, say police.

Cyle Warren Abbott Jr from Eureka, California, demanded cash after entering the gas station brandishing what the clerk believed was a semi-automatic handgun, according to police.

He was given a small, undisclosed amount of cash before he fled the scene at around 6am on Friday, taking with him two bottles of beer.

Eureka Police Sergeant Steve Watson said Abbott told officers he needed cash to leave town for a fresh start, but then realised his mistake.

Abbott returned three hours later and gave back most of the cash saying he was sorry.

He told police the weapon he had used was a BB gun which he had thrown in a grassy area after leaving the station, but police have not found it. 

Police said he took officers to the spot where he tossed the gun, but it could not be located.

Abbott was arrested on suspicion of robbery and a probation violation.

He was booked into the Humboldt County Correctional Facility and his bail has been set at $50,000.

Anyone with any information concerning this incident, including the whereabouts of the pistol, is asked to call the Eureka Police Department at 441-4060  or 441-4044 after hours.

He was given a small, undisclosed amount of cash before he fled from the gas station on the 1000 block of Broadway on Friday, taking with him two bottles of beer
