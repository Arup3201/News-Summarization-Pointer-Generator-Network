Former fan favourite Luis Garcia has backed under-fire Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard to bring the good times back to Anfield, while warning the Kop faithful that Rafael Benitez is not the answer.

It has been more than seven years since the diminutive Spaniard bid an emotional farewell to his adoring Liverpool fans to rejoin Atletico Madrid.

It was a successful three-year stint on Merseyside for the La Masia graduate, with Champions League glory in dramatic circumstances on that memorable night in Istanbul in 2005 being the pinnacle.

Rafael Benitez guided Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005 (above) but he not the answer to Liverpool's current problems, says Garcia who played under the Spanish coach at Anfield 

Garcia, now 36, has recently come out of retirement to ply his trade in India’s inaugural Super League for Atletico de Kolkata, with the tournament heading into a title play-off in the coming weeks.

Despite his current intentions to keep his weary legs in shape to compete amongst much younger opposition in the Land of Prayers, Garcia admits to keeping a watchful eye on events back in England. And Garcia is especially disheartened by a mounting media maelstrom over whether an aging Gerrard still has what it takes to compete at the highest level.

'Stevie is the captain, the leader, he has to play,' said Garcia.

The Spaniard left Liverpool to join Atletico Madrid in 2007 after three years on Merseyside 

'So many of the players look up to him because of what he does on the pitch and what the club means to him.

'Even though when I was there he was much younger, he still had a presence on the pitch, and he has not lost that.

'Lose him you lose the soul of the team. He will make the other players up their game, and that is what you need from your captain.

The Reds season went from bad to worse on Tuesday night as Gerrard’s late equaliser at home to Swiss outfit Basel was not enough to spur his side on to the victory they needed to progress to the knockout stages of Europe’s premier competition.

Such a disappointment has increased the already intense pressure on boss Brendan Rodgers, despite last season’s exploits.

Talk around Anfield of former boss Rafael Benitez making a sensational return to the club, who he guided to that fifth European Cup crown in Turkey, has surfaced as a result of the Reds’ predicament.

The Spaniard's family still reside on Merseyside, and with his contract running down at Napoli, and fans yearning for the glory days to return, Benitez could prove to be a popular choice.

However, Garcia is not convinced the move would suit either party, insisting that age-old decree when considering returning to the scene of such success should be adhered to.

'Never go back,' adds Garcia, who will skipper his new side in the upcoming Indian Super League play-offs.

'I don’t think Benitez will ever go back as a manager. Maybe something else, director of football or something.

'To go back after winning the Champions League and many other trophies and struggle to turn things around would be a bad move.

'He is like a God in Liverpool.'

The question on everyone’s lips when in the company of the ubiquitous midfielder is whether he believes his infamous 'ghost goal' in the Champions League semi-final second leg at Anfield was over the line.

'Yes, yes it was a goal,' Garcia states.

'It does not annoy me when I get asked, I like it.

'I had the same thing here in India in our opening match, but it was disallowed. I knew it had gone in, as I did against Chelsea.'
