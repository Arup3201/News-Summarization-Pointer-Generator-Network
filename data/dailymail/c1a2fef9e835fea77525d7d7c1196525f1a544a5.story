An evil thug who savagely beat a little baby girl - breaking both her legs, fracturing her skull and leaving her with permanent brain damage - has jailed for 10 years and nine months.

Polish-born Grzegorze Lis, 35, even bit the tiny eight-week-old's arm as he inflicted an horrific catalogue of injuries, the court heard.

The violence was so severe, the child has been left her blind and deaf and in need of constant round the clock care, it was said.

Horror: St Albans Crown Court heard harrowing details of how the eight-week-old suffered agonising injuries at the hands of evil Lis

And the tiny child was left in agony for almost a week because Lis' twisted partner, Joanna Skrodzka, 22, refused to alert authorities in a bid to protect him, St Albans crown court was told.

Skrodzka, who shared a flat in, Hemel Hempstead, with Lis, was jailed for two years for an offence of child cruelty.

St Albans crown court heard today that the injuries to the baby, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were inflicted by Lis.

Both the baby’s legs were broken at the lower shin area close to the ankles. Both thigh bones had also been broken.

The child suffered a fractured skull 
caused by a massive impact injury and there was evidence that it had 
been violently shaken in a separate incident causing bleeding on the 
brain and leaving it starved of oxygen, which had left her blind.

Jane Bickerstaff QC prosecuting told 
how in March of this year the baby girl born just two months earlier in 
January was attacked and violently assaulted by unemployed Lis on a 
number of occasions.

But Skrodzka turned a blind eye to the terrible pain the baby was suffering, the judge was told.

As a result, no medical help was there for the little girl.

It was not until almost a week later 
that staff at Watford General Hospital saw the baby for the first time 
and she was immediately transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in 
London.

Today Polish born Miss Skrodzka appeared
for sentence having been found guilty by a jury last month of the 
offence of child cruelty.

Recorder Amanda Tipples who had 
presided over Skrodzka’s trial said that she thought the injuries had 
been inflicted sometime between Thursday, March 1, or Friday, March 2, 
of this year by Lis.

Passing sentence, Recorder Tipples 
told Skrodzka: 'You failed to get any medical help for her even though 
you were aware something terrible had happened to her and she was 
unwell.'

The recorder said a 'right thinking person' would not have waited more than five minutes once it was realised the child was ill.

Lis was jailed on Monday for two offences of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the baby girl with intent and causing her actual bodily harm.

During Skrodzka’s trial, expert evidence was given by a doctor that in 600 cases he had been involved in, this was one of the worst cases of brain damage he had ever seen where the child had survived.

The court heard today the child is now incontinent because of it’s injuries and will need 24 hour care for the rest of her life.
