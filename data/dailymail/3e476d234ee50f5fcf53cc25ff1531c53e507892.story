The Egyptian authorities have agreed to stop raiding the offices of human rights and pro-democracy groups after the U.S. government intervened.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta welcomed the decision, but expressed 'deep concern' that the attacks by security forces had been allowed to take place.

The non-governmental organisations had been accused 
by Egypt's military rulers of destabilising security by fomenting 
protests with the help of foreign funding.

Thursday's raids on a total of 17 offices 
throughout Egypt were part of the ruling generals' attempt to blame 
'foreign hands' for the unrest that continues to roil Egypt since the 
18-day revolt that ousted long-time leader Hosni Mubarak in February.

Among the offices ransacked were the 
U.S.-headquartered National Democratic Institute, Freedom House and the 
International Republican Institute, which is observing Egypt's staggered
parliamentary elections.

The Obama administration demanded 
Egyptian authorities immediately halt the raids on NGOs, saying they are 'inconsistent' with long-standing 
U.S-Egypt cooperation.

The U.S. State Department called on 
the Egyptian government 'to immediately end the harassment of NGO staff,
return all property and resolve this issue'.

Yesterday the Egyptian authorities agreed to call an end to the raids after negotiations with Mr Panetta and U.S. ambassador to Cairo Anne Patterson.

According to a State Department 
spokesman, Ms Patterson told the authorities she expected 'all 
international NGOs, including those that receive U.S. government 
support, to be able to return to normal operations as soon as possible 
in support of the democratic transition under way in Egypt.'

She agreed to take part in a dialogue
with Egyptian officials to better explain the work of the organizations
and address any concerns they might have. 'These NGOs should be allowed
to operate freely as they do in countries around the world in support 
of democracy and free elections,' the spokesman said.

After Ms Patterson's discussions, Mr 
Panetta spoke by phone to the head of Egypt's ruling military council, 
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, to emphasize the importance the 
administration places on the country's democratic transition and the 
ability of non-governmental organisations to work.

Panetta expressed appreciation for 
the decision to stop the raids and make it easier for NGOs to work in 
Egypt, a Pentagon spokesman said. 'The secretary emphasised that it is 
critical for Egypt to continue on the path to democratic transition,' he
added.

The raids on the NGOs were the first since Mubarak left office, though 
Egyptian officials have been levying accusations for months that the 
civil society groups are serving a foreign agenda.

Most recently, Justice Minister Adel Abdel-Hamid this month accused around 300 non-profit 
groups of receiving unauthorised foreign funding and using the money for
protests.

The Interior Ministry said the raids on ten non-profit organisations were 
part of the investigation into foreign funding of rights groups.

By far the largest recipient of foreign funding in Egypt is the military
itself, which has for more than 30 years received about $1.3billion in
annual U.S. security assistance.

Freedom House said its staff were held incommunicado during the raids 
and that mobile phones, laptops, funds and documents found during the 
interrogations were confiscated.

The group said in a statement the raids
came just three days after it formally submitted papers to register its
offices in accordance with Egyptian law.

Troops and police sealed the doors of the civil society groups and 
banned anyone from entering or speaking with employees as they were 
interrogated.

Freedom House spokesman Charles Dunne said: 'In the current fiscal environment, the United States must not subsidise
authoritarianism in Egypt while the Egyptian government is preventing 
NGOs from implementing democracy and human rights projects subsidised by
the U.S. taxpayer.'

The Cairo-based Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which is 
not under investigation, said in a statement that the raids went beyond 
the type of Mubarak-era tactics that spurred hundreds of thousands of 
Egyptians to take to the streets demanding freedom and democracy during 
this year's uprising.

ANHRI said in a statement: 'Mubarak's regime did not dare to undertake such practices prior to the 
uprising', adding that the storming of the civil society 
organisations' offices is part of 'a systematic campaign against these 
organisations, which was prepared for in advance'.

The country's military was cheered by protesters when it took over 
security from Mubarak's hated police force in January during the 
uprising.

The military, long the country's most powerful establishment 
and one that produced Egypt's last three presidents, sought to portray 
itself as a key player in the revolt that toppled Mubarak's 29-year 
rule.

However, in the eight months since Mubarak's exit, the military, led 
by a general who served for 20 years as Mubarak's defence minister, has 
been methodically seeking to discredit the reformers, accusing them of 
illegally receiving foreign funds and being part of a plot hatched 
abroad to destabilise Egypt.

Egypt's leading pro-democracy advocate, Nobel peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, denounced the raids.

Writing on his Twitter account, he said: 'Human rights organisations are the guardians of nascent freedom. 
Efforts to suffocate them will be a major setback and will surely 
backfire.'

An official with the Egyptian Attorney General's office said at least 
one of the U.S.-based organisations being searched was operating without
proper permits. He did not say which one.

Laws requiring local and foreign civil society groups to register with 
the government have long been a source of contention, with rights 
activists accusing the government of using legal provisions to go after 
groups critical of its policies. Offenders can be sentenced to prison 
terms.

A security official said 'influencing public opinion in non-peaceful 
ways' is among the possible charges that could be brought against the ten
organisations being investigated. The official spoke on condition of 
anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to reporters.

The security sweep on civil society offices comes on the heels of a 
military crackdown on protesters demanding ruling generals hand over 
power to a civilian authority.

Soldiers attempting to end the protest 
last week beat women and dragged one half-naked while kicking her in the
street. At least 17 protesters were killed, adding to the roughly 100 
people killed in clashes with security since Mubarak's exit.

Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's deputy director for the 
Middle-East and North Africa, said that the ruling 
Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is trying to attack groups that have
criticised the military's human rights records.

She said: 'I believe SCAF is trying to find some scapegoat for their human rights
record. Targeting civil society was a technique used by 
Mubarak, so it really is reminiscent of the worst tactics of the Mubarak
era.'
