Palermo president Maurizio Zamparini has slammed Serie A rivals Sampdoria for signing 'has-been' Samuel Eto'o.

Eto'o, 33, has joined Sampdoria as a free agent after leaving Everton where he scored four goals in 20 appearances for Roberto Martinez's side.

Zamparini's Palermo face Eto'o's new side on Sunday, and the Italian has stoked the fire by poking fun at Sampdoria's new signing.

He told Corriere dello Sport: 'Massimo Ferrero is extrovert and understands that sometimes football can be about putting on a show, but we’ll have to see how much fun he is when Samp lose a few games.

'I would never have signed Eto’o, as he is a has-been at the end of his career. His arrival is fitting with Ferrero’s day job, as it’s all about cinema and publicity.

'Fortunately Eto’o isn’t playing today, as he might’ve read those phrases and scored two goals against us! 

Television pictures showed Eto'o arriving at a clinic in Rome for a medical. He was due to be presented to the crowd before Sunday's Serie A match at home. 

Eto'o has won four league titles, seven domestic cups, a FIFA Club World Cup medal and three Champions League, two with Barcelona and one with Inter Milan.

Sampdoria are joint third in Serie A alongside Napoli with 33 points from 19 games.
