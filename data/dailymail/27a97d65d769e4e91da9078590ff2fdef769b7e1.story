Outspoken Australian senator Jacqui Lambie has been branded the 'Australian Sarah Palin' by an American radio host who said he is glad the US isn't the only country with colourful politicians.

The David Packman Show poked fun at the Palmer United Party senator, who called her now infamous attempt to explain sharia law as tossing 'together such an epic word salad'.

The host of the American radio show commented that the question should have been simple 'for some who is an anti-Muslim crusader,' but Ms Lambie delivered 'a brutal assault on the English language.'

In the interview with  ABC's Insiders on Ms Lambie struggled to explain what she thought sharia law was when asked by the show's presenter Barrie Cassidy, while reiterating her tough stance against the moral code.

'If you are not going to show your allegiance to our law, then get out,' she said.

But Ms Lambie was left tongue-tied when asked what she understood sharia to mean.

'Well I think...when it comes to...sharia law...you know to me...it obviously involves terrorism,' she told Mr Cassidy.

'It involves a power that is not a healthy power.'

The show compared her to controversial Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, labeling the interview 'completely embarrassing'.

'I think Sarah Palin would be hard pressed to top that,' the host said.

'I'm sorry Australia has to deal with this...We wouldn't wish this upon anybody.'

The show ridiculed her proposal for a $3400 fine for wearing a 'Muslim head or face covering without a reasonable excuse', pointing out that she doesn't identify what a reasonable excuse would actually entail. 

The host drew attention to her belief that Muslims have plans to use ebola to launch a terrorist attack on Australian soil, noting that it would be slowest way to kill a nation. 

Lambie has been outspoken in her views on Islam and Sharia law, though she has had difficulty expressing her views clearly.

'It's not going to come as a shock when I tell you that I'm not an Islamic scholar,' Ms Lambie admitted. 

In an address to parliament, the Palmer United Party member said 'These thugs and extremists will not stop their acts of terrorism and depravity until their way of life, their culture and their law is imposed on Australia - indeed the whole world.'

'These maniacs and depraved humans will not stop committing their cold blooded butchery and rapes until every woman in Australia wears a burqa and is subservient to men,' Senator Lambie said.

Ms Lambie also said 'every major terrorist attack in the western world' such as 911, the Bali Bombings, the Boston marathon bombings and 'recent beheadings and massacres' had been carried out by supporters of sharia law.

Senator Lambie has previously suggested sending troops over to fight in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East, and suggested: 'We need to get rid of them (Islamic extremeists) and their associates on home soil' first. 

'Clean up the rubbish in your own backyard before you try to clean up the rubbish in others', she added.

Clive Palmer has distanced himself from the outlandish comments, and told Fairfax Media: 'Party policy is determined by a meeting of the members and is announced by the leader'.

This follows his tweets earlier in the day where he said Australian's need to 'remain united' as they have 'strong obligations towards each other'.

In August, Ms Lambie made headlines again when she called for Australia to look into using missiles to defend the nation from other countries 'to stop our grandchildren from becoming slaves to an anti-democratic power' like China. 

She made the comments in support of Palmer, who days before had ranted about 'Chinese mongrels' and 'Chinese b***ards' on ABC's Q&A program. She refused to say 'sorry' to China, despite Mr Palmer penning an apology letter to the superpower. 

One Twitter user asked, 'Are we absolutely sure Jacqui Lambie isn't just a new Chris Lilley character?', echoing the comments from the David Packman show, who said 'It's fantastic...it's comforting to know that these types of people exist elsewhere, and that we're [the US] not the only ones who have to deal with it.
