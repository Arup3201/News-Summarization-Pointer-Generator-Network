Time to go: Ed Miliband said it 'beggars belief' that Jeremy Hunt was still in his job

Ed Miliband tonight said it 'beggars belief' that Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt is still in his job after an email claimed he asked the Murdoch empire to help him stop a phone hacking inquiry.

The Labour leader said today the 'accumulation of evidence' about the minister's close ties with News Corp meant that his position was untenable.

At the time the latest bombshell email was sent, Mr Hunt was supposed to be the independent arbiter who decided whether the company's bid to buy out BSkyB was successful.

The message asked News Corp to ‘advise him privately’ as the News of the World was engulfed in hacking allegations.

The disclosure is another blow to Mr 
Hunt, already fighting to save his career over claims about his handling
of the Murdochs’ £8billion takeover bid. It also implicated 
Downing Street in the row for the first time.

Today Mr Miliband said that Mr Hunt had the Murdoch's interests and not the government's interests at heart.

'One of the reasons so many people hate politics so much right now is that they think politicians stand up for the wrong people, not the right people,' he said.

'This is a clear example of that - Jeremy Hunt was standing up for Rupert Murdoch, not for the public interest.

'Out of touch with the many. Too close to the few. Jeremy Hunt should go.'

In the email sent on June 27 last 
year, a News Corporation lobbyist told Mrs Brooks, then one of Mr 
Murdoch’s most senior UK executives, that Mr Hunt was poised to make an 
‘extremely helpful’ statement about their company’s proposed acquisition
of BSkyB.

Frederic Michel 
suggested the Culture Secretary would give a green light to the bid 
because he believes ‘phone hacking has nothing to do with the media 
plurality issues’. It also said Mr Hunt ‘wants to prevent a public 
inquiry’ into the culture of phone hacking at the News of the World.

Leveson Inquiry yesterday, received an email from News Corp's Fred Michel claiming Jeremy Hunt, right, was asking him for 'private advice'

The email raises questions about the Culture Secretary’s close relationship with the Murdoch empire.

Mr Hunt’s special adviser Adam Smith resigned last month after it emerged that he secretly passed Mr Michel privileged information on News Corp’s takeover bid for BSkyB while Mr Hunt was supposed to be ruling on the bid as an impartial, quasi-judicial watchdog.

Mr Hunt, who has insisted he acted with propriety throughout and did not know what Mr Smith was doing, yesterday insisted the latest email was ‘completely inaccurate’.

His spokesman pointed out that soon after the email exchange took place, the Culture Secretary asked the watchdog Ofcom to rule on whether the phone hacking scandal should affect the BSkyB bid.

Mr Michel has admitted that his repeated references to ‘JH’ in emails in fact referred to information obtained from his special adviser, and Government officials suggest he exaggerated his contacts to impress his bosses.

Proof? The email which apparently proves Jeremy Hunt asked for advice from Murdoch's empire

In the email Mr Michel, News Corp’s head of public affairs for Europe, told Mrs Brooks that Mr Hunt ‘will be making references to phone hacking in his statement on Rubicon [the codename for the Sky bid] this week’.

He said the Culture Secretary believed police were ‘pursuing things thoroughly and phone hacking has nothing to do with the media plurality issue’, a position Mr Michel described as ‘extremely helpful’.

He claimed Mr Hunt wanted to widen the remit of a Parliamentary inquiry and ‘prevent a public enquiry’.

‘JH [Jeremy Hunt] is now starting to looking to phone-hacking/practices more thoroughly and has asked me to advise him privately in the coming weeks and guide his and No 10’s positioning,’ the email concluded.

Tough day: Mrs Brooks leaves in a Black Range Rover after giving evidence to Leveson Inquiry

Three days later, on June 30, Mr Hunt told MPs that while the phone hacking allegations were ‘very serious’ they were ‘not material’ to his consideration of the BSkyB bid.

Days later, however, the Guardian revealed that Milly Dowler’s voicemail messages had been targeted by the News of the World – a disclosure which led to News Corp dropping its bid for BSkyB, Mrs Brooks’s resignation and the Government setting up the Leveson inquiry, although the revelations have now been discredited.

Downing Street has refused to refer the allegations against Mr Hunt to a sleaze watchdog which oversees the ministerial code until after he too has given evidence to Leveson.

Mrs Brooks, giving evidence yesterday, said that after briefly discussing the BSkyB bid with Mr Cameron at a dinner in December 2010, she had a more substantial conversation with Mr Osborne at a restaurant that month.

The following day she emailed Mr Michel saying that Mr Osborne had expressed ‘total bafflement’ at Ofcom’s latest response to the bid.
