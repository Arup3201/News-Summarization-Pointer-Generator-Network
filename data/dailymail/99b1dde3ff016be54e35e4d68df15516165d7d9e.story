New Zealand reigned supreme once again, taking the prize for Top Country in Wanderlust Magazine's 2015 Travel Awards for the second year in a row.

With a satisfaction rating of almost 98 per cent, the Kiwis sure know a thing or two about keeping their visitors happy.

But for those who prefer more adventurous getaways, allow us to point you toward Papua New Guinea, which scooped up top honours in the Top Emerging Destination category.

Papua New Guinea was ranked first as Wanderlust Magazine's Top Emerging Destination for 2015

The country is known for its lush coral reefs, and as such, exceptional snorkelling and scuba diving

Despite it's difficult travel terrain, the country ranked at 100 per cent in visitor satisfaction.

Mongolia and Montenegro tied for second place, while Iran and Bolivia came in third.

'Despite being challenging for independent travellers, Papua New Guinea has struck a chord with our readers,' Editor in Chief, Lyn Hughes, explained. 

'It seems that people are increasingly looking for that off the beaten track travel experience and PNG, along with Mongolia and Iran, really do satisfy their thirst for adventure.'

Although the travel terrain is difficult, visitors are able to to visit traditional tribal cultural ceremonies

One of the most popular tourist destinations is the Kokoda Track,  a footpath offering views of the Owen Stanley mountain range

Among the top attractions in the exotic Oceanic country, Papua New Guinea offers incomparable snorkelling and scuba diving opportunities, as well as a chance to experience fascinating traditional tribal cultures.

However, with little to no tourism infrastructure, it's not a destination to visit without proper preparation.

Still, its biodiversity is unparalleled, particularly along the Kokoda Track, which runs throughout the Owen Stanley mountain range.

Other emerging destinations include Mongolia and Montenegro (pictured), known for its stunning coastline

Iran took the fourth spot in the Emerging Destinations category. Pictured: the Azadi monument in Tehran

Mongolia and Montenegro have recently gained prominence 

Famous for it's nomad culture, visitors to Mongolia can opt to explore the country's Gobi desert from the comfort of a traditional yurt.

The small Balkan nation of Montenegro is known for its expansive coastline and stunning mountain ranges - and is quickly growing in popularity as a premiere European summer beach destination. 

Luang Prabang, Laos, nabbed the Top City spot, which isn't surprising given that it's UNESCO Heritage listed

Luang Prabang is particularly known for its friendly, welcoming locals and the large population of monks

Luang Prabang in Laos is likewise back for another year at the top of its category, Top City, boasting a satisfaction rating of just over 97 per cent.

Known for monks, sticky rice, and lovely locals, Luang Prabang has held the top spot nine times in the last 10 years.

1. Papua New Guinea 

2. Mongolia

3. Montenegro

4. Iran

5. Bolivia

Not surprising, considering that the city itself is so culturally rich that it's UNESCO Heritage listed.

Closely following in second is Bagan, Burma, with Stockholm, Sweden, rounding out the top three.

The inclusion of Stockholm is particularly surprising, given the fact that Wanderlust readers have often opted to select Asian hubs in this category.

Still, with unique cuisine, minimalist design and even popular TV crime dramas, Scandinavia is gaining more attention than ever before as a must-visit travel destination.

Bagan, Burma, is known for its world-class architecture, such as the Ananda Pahto temple and the Shwezigon Paya religious site.

Stockholm, Sweden is the third ranked in the Top Cities category thanks to its cosmopolitan nature

Bagan, Burma was named the second best city, largely due to its breathtaking religious sites, like the Ananda Pahto temple, pictured.

Other Top Country highlights include Ethiopia and Namibia.

'Although New Zealand is back on top, it is particularly interesting to see Ethiopia voted third - having not even made the top ten last year,' Hughes added.

'With its rare wolves, rock-hewn churches, mighty mountains and elaborate coffee ceremonies, this country is fascinating.
