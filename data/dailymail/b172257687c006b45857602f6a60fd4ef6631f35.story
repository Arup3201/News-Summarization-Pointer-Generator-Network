A woman who was bitten by a false widow spider as she slept is now terrified to close her eyes as she fears the poisonous creature is still on the loose in her house.

Sarah Lucie Payne, 47, was woken in the night by a sharp pain in her left hand that she initially dismissed as a mosquito bite. But just hours later a painful, red blister erupted on her skin.

The dog walker later found a web behind her bed and an expert was able to confirm that it was a false widow - Britain's most venomous spider - that had bitten her.

Mrs Payne has since cleaned her house in Worthing, West Sussex, but can't find the spider. She now fears that it may strike again.

She said: 'I think it is very very bizarre. I've searched the house but I can't find it. I have to have a search around the bedroom when I go to bed and I'm looking around myself.

'I have even taken the pictures off the wall to see if it is hiding, but I can't find it.

'I'm just hoping that I can't possibly be bitten twice. That would be really bad luck.' 

False widows – cousins of the infamous black widow spider – give very painful bites which often swell as the body tries to combat the venom. Some people have reported being left unconscious by the bites, but to date there have never been any confirmed deaths from them.

About the size of a 10p piece, with a bulbous body and white markings, the false widow spider is now a fairly common sight in people’s homes, where it seeks refuge in autumn as the weather turns.

Some false widows are native to Britain, but the most venomous, the noble false widow, was first imported in fruit crates from the Canary Islands more than a century ago. Since then, they have spread northwards from the South Coast. 

Mrs Payne, who lives with her husband, Ian, 50, was bitten in the middle of the night earlier this month and initially dismissed it as a mosquito bite.

But after the bite started to bubble and blister she discovered a false widow's web behind her bed and a friend who keeps spiders confirmed she had been bitten by the poisonous creature.

She thought the wound would heal itself but a dentist later told her to go straight to Worthing Hospital for emergency treatment when the poison started to spread.

Mrs Payne said: 'I woke up in the night and got up to go to the loo and though "oh that's feel strange, I think I've been bitten" - it was itchy - but I went back to sleep.

'In the morning I had this little red patch but I carried on with my day until it started to feel like it was rubbing on my coat sleeve.

'I looked down and it had this massive red blister - it looked like a big jelly baby.

'I wasn't that worried about it - I thought it was really weird - but I showed it to someone who is a bit of a spider expert and keeps tarantulas.

Wound: Mrs Payne, from Worthing, West Sussex, initially thought that the wound would heal itself, but a dentist later told her to go to the hospital. She was later given antibiotics to treat the infection

'He said it was definitely a false widow bite and said that I would know it was one because they have very messy webs.

'I knew then that it was because I had been looking around my bedroom and next to the bed I found this huge cobweb and when I saw it I thought exactly that - it was really messy.

'I went to the dentist a few days later and she said I should go straight to A and E.

'It was getting a red ring around it. They removed the blister, cleaned it, dressed it, and give me a week's worth of antibiotics.

'It's getting better but it keeps tingling and fizzing. I think it is very very bizarre.'

Growing population: The false widow spider was first spotted in the UK in 1879 - they are now a common sight in many British homes

The spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most poisonous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing.

Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.

The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.

It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size.

The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England.

This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE

The key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened.

To avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs.

Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight.

If you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things.

If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.
