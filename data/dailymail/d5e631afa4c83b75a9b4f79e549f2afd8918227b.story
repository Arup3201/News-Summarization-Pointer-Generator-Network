One Direction's approach to promoting their 2015 US tour was to wear 11 different NFL team jerseys. 

The tour begins at the Qualcomm Stadium, home of San Diego Chargers in California and ends at the Gillette Stadium, home to the New England Patriots. 

Derby fan Niall Horan is no stranger to pulling on another teams jersey.

The 21-year-old trained at Chelsea's training ground in Cobham after getting permission from Blues' manager Jose Mourinho.

The Irishman, however, looked very comfortable wearing variety of NFL jerseys, constantly posing with his thumb up.

Doncaster Rovers fans also may be put out by the bands promotional posters as joint-owner Louis Tomlinson looked extremely pleased in the Pittsburgh Steelers' jersey.

Heartthrob Harry Styles seemed to be too cool to wear the jerseys as he opted to hold them up, bar the Milwaukee Brewers jersey, which was draped over his shoulders.

The One Direction boys will hope that the idea will help gain support from NFL fans to fill the huge stadiums.

Their US tour begins on July 9 2015 at the Qualcomm Stadium.

Another change by the boys sees them pose in the purple of the Baltimore Ravens 

Horan, who has taken part in Chelsea training sessions, looked comfortable in the blue of the Bills 

Styles opted for a slightly different pose as the boys donned the Philadelphia Eagles' top

The boys give the thumbs up as the wear the New England Patriots jersey 

Styles decides to drape the Milwaukee Brewers jersey is worthy of being worn
