Locked up in her palace and spending her lonely days composing sad songs, the life story of Hawaii's first and last Queen is tragic.

Liliuokalani, originally called name Lydia Kamakaeha, was the last Hawaiian sovereign to govern the islands, which were annexed by the United States in 1898.

In 1862, Liliuokalani married John Owen Dominis, son of a Boston sea captain and himself an official in the Hawaiian government.

Hawaiian royalty: Liliuokalani, original name Lydia Kamakaeha was the first and only reigning Hawaiian queen and the last Hawaiian sovereign to govern the islands, which were annexed by the United States in 1898

1870s royalty: In 1874 her brother David Kalakaua was chosen king, and in 1877, on the death of a second brother, W.P. Leleiohoku, she became Queen which is when she was known by her royal name, Liliuokalani

Their marriage was said to be an unhappy union and they were rumours of his infidelity.

They lived with his widowed mother at Washington Place, today the official residence of Hawaii's Governor.

In 1874 Liliuokalani's brother David Kalakaua was chosen king, but when he died in January 1891, Liliuokalani ascended the throne, becoming the first woman ever to occupy it.

From then on she was known by her royal name, Queen Liliuokalani.

Fortunately her experience as Princess Regent during King Kalakaua's nine-month world trip in 1881 and visit to the United States ,in 1890 had prepared her for her new role as Queen of Hawaii.

Members of the native population persuaded the new queen to draft a new constitution in an attempt to restore native rights and powers.

The move was resisted by the Committee on Annexation, which were a small group of businessmen and politicians who felt that annexation by the United States, the major importer of Hawaiian agricultural products, would be beneficial for the economy of Hawaii.Â 

On January 17, 1893, Queen Liliuokalani yielded her authority announcing it was to 'avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life.'

In 1895, a failed attempt by Hawaiian royalists to restore Queen Liliuokalani to power resulted in her arrest.

She was forced to sign a document of abdication that relinquished all her future claims to the throne.

She was then made to endure a humiliating public trial before a military tribunal in her former throne room.

Queen Liliuokalani was convicted of having knowledge of a royalist plot, and was fined - she was sentenced to five years in prison and hard labor - although it was later reduced.

Instead she imprisoned in an upstairs bedroom of Iolani Palace and was denied any visitors other than one lady in waiting.

Queen Liliuokalani spent her days reading, quilting, crochet-work, as well as composing music.

She wrote approximately 165 songs, 
including Ke Aloha O Ka Haku -- The Queen's Prayer, which was written 
during her lonely imprisonment.

Even after her release from Iolani 
Palace, Queen Liliuokalani  remained under house arrest for five months at her 
private home, Washington Place.

It was still another eight months before all restrictions were lifted and she was allowed to move freely and in 1896, the Republic of Hawaii gave her a full pardon and restored her civil rights.

On July 12, 1898, the Hawaiian islands were officially annexed by the United States.

Queen Liliuokalani  lived in Washington Place until her death, aged 79, in 1917 due to complications from a stroke.

She received a grand state funeral due to her status as a former head of state and her remains were placed in the Royal Mausoleum.

Upon her death, Queen Liliuokalani   dictated in her will that all of her possessions and properties be sold.

The funds raised went to the Queen Liliuokalani Children's Trust to help orphaned and indigent children and it is still in existence today.

In 1993, 100 years after the overthrow, President Clinton signed a Congressional resolution in which the United States government formally apologized to the native Hawaiian people.

Time: Today Hawaii is associated with idyllic beaches and is touted as an ideal holiday destination, but over 100 years ago, debate over its sovereignty was fierce
