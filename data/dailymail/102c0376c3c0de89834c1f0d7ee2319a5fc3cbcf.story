Liam Fox enjoyed sunshine breaks with his friend thanks to flights funded by the taxpayer, it emerged last night.

The Defence Secretary tagged four short foreign trips with Adam Werritty, who was best man at his wedding, on to official Government trips. Two of the mini-breaks were in Dubai and two in Hong Kong.

On one occasion, Dr Fox took two days’ annual leave to spend time with his former flatmate and self-styled ‘adviser’ in luxury in the Gulf before continuing his journey to meet British troops risking their lives in Afghanistan.

As the one and two-day breaks were tagged on to Government trips, Dr Fox could legitimately have his travel paid for from the public purse.

The new disclosure raised more questions about Dr Fox’s judgment and his dealings with Mr Werritty.

It came as Mr Werritty attempted to explain exactly how he managed to afford his air fares to meet Dr Fox on the same visits.

He
told senior civil servants he was employed as an international 
networker by wealthy business donors who had an interest in politics and
energy security and needed a middle-man to open doors to senior 
politicians.

Details of the mini-breaks emerged as:

■ Mr Werritty was quizzed for two hours by a senior civil servant about how he paid for his extensive globetrotting;

■ Sri Lankan officials claimed Mr Werritty offered to help them buy arms during a visit with Dr Fox;

■ A businessman accused Dr Fox of telling MPs ‘half-truths’ about their meeting with Mr Werritty and said the adviser liked to travel first-class;

■ David Cameron faced demands to bring in a sleaze watchdog to run the inquiry;

■ Dr Fox pulled out of a press conference today in Paris with his French counterpart.

Dr Fox is under investigation by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell after it emerged that 33-year-old Mr Werritty held 40 meetings with the Defence Secretary in just 16 months.

Mr Werritty was asked to explain how, despite having little obvious income, he has been able to afford to run up an estimated bill of £85,000 on flights and luxury hotels since the general election.

He has now been asked to provide bank statements to back his claims he was being bankrolled by wealthy businessmen.

On 18 occasions since the general election the two friends met abroad and four times Dr Fox, 50, took leave before, in the middle or at the end of official trips to meet Mr Werritty.

Dr Fox, who has in the past stayed in
five-star hotels – including the  63-storey, £600-a-night Address hotel
in Dubai and the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong – paid for his own 
accommodation during the breaks.

He did not pay for Mr Werritty and the MoD has refused to say who picked up his tab.

The details of the trips were disclosed in a list published by the Ministry of Defence on Monday.

Sources close to the Secretary of 
State insisted there was no additional burden on the taxpayer because he
would have travelled on the routes while undertaking trips for the 
Ministry of Defence.

But if he had not had the benefit of 
the official flights, he would have had to pay for the flights from 
Britain from his own pocket – at a cost of around £10,000 in British 
Airways business class.

Labour MP Dan Jarvis, who served as a
major in the Parachute Regiment in Iraq and Afghanistan, said: ‘I find 
this appalling. The message that it sends out to our Armed Forces, who 
are doing a fantastic job in the most difficult conditions, is that the 
first priority of the Defence Secretary is a bit of sunshine by the side
of the pool rather than the well-being of troops facing danger every 
day.’

Last night Mr Werritty faced serious new
allegations. Sources in Sri Lanka told Channel 4 News that he had 
offered to help the regime there acquire arms supplies for internal 
security during a visit with Dr Fox – claims denied by the Defence 
Secretary.

Mr Werritty also stands accused of 
offering to improve the regime’s international reputation following 
accusations that the government there was guilty of genocide during its 
war with the Tamil Tiger rebels.

Pressure intensified on the Defence 
Secretary yesterday as David Cameron faced growing calls to draft in Sir
Philip Mawer, the independent guardian of the ministerial code of 
conduct, to rule on whether Dr Fox has broken the code.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg made
clear he thinks Dr Fox has broken the rules, saying ministers should 
observe the ‘spirit and the letter of the ministerial code’ and that Dr 
Fox admits ‘a blurring of the professional, political and the personal’ 
in a way ‘that raises serious issues’.

In private, senior Lib Dems are demanding that Sir Philip is drafted in. And Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said an ‘independent person’ should conduct the investigation so it would ‘have much more public confidence’.

Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said: ‘Doesn’t this show that they’re prepared to sacrifice high standards in public office to protect the Secretary of State?’

Dr Fox also came under fire again from a businessman with whom he and Mr Werritty held talks in Dubai in June.

Harvey Boulter, who was hoping to sell technology to the Libyan rebels, said it was a ‘half-truth’ for Dr Fox to suggest that their meeting was the result of a chance encounter with Mr Werritty in a restaurant.

He had a meeting with Mr Werritty in April, following which the ‘clear intention’ was that the ‘adviser’ would arrange for him to see Fox.

He said he had assumed that Mr Werritty was a Government adviser to Dr Fox. ‘To me he was the route to Liam Fox, without a doubt,’ Mr Boulter said. ‘He did disclose to me that he liked to travel first-class.’

He added: ‘This appeared to be a friendship between Fox and Werritty and I think Werritty perhaps overstepped the friendship into an official role. I don’t understand the motivation of Dr Fox allowing him to do that.’

Dr Fox’s aides said Mr Boulter had changed his story and pointed out that Mr Boulter confirmed ‘the topic of money never came up’.

His spokesman denied that Mr Werritty had offered to help the Sri Lankans acquire arms, saying: ‘Dr Fox’s visits to Sri Lanka in opposition have been to promote post conflict reconciliation and development. Any suggestion otherwise is without foundation and is insulting.’

Adam Werritty’s business dealings were under scrutiny last night as questions were raised about how he financed his high-rolling lifestyle.

On the one hand the self-styled adviser to Defence Secretary Liam Fox was able to take at least 18 trips around the globe to meet his friend, trips which are estimated to have cost up to £85,000.

But on the other it has emerged that Mr Werritty was so cash-strapped he had asked for a rent reduction on his flat in London.

Mr Werritty stunned business associates who believed he worked for the Ministry of Defence by boasting about his generous perks, including plush hotels and first-class travel, at a time when the cash-strapped Whitehall department was implementing significant budget cuts.

Yet an investigation into the 33-year-old’s finances indicates that, at best, he earned around £55,000 a year from his businesses and consultancy firms.

The freelance defence consultant had extraordinary access to the MoD – visiting 22 times – and crossed paths with the Defence Secretary on 18 overseas trips.

He has flown to destinations including Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Israel, the U.S., Singapore, Switzerland and Sri Lanka, and stayed in hotels. The MoD insisted it had not paid.

A calculation using British Airways prices yesterday suggested that flying economy class would cost Mr Werritty around £25,000, with business class seats pushing the bill closer to £78,000. Accommodation would cost an estimated £7,000 based on £200-a-night rooms – a total of £85,000.

Downing Street sources warned that Sir Gus O’Donnell, the country’s top civil servant, would be faced with figures that did not add up when he investigated the Scotsman’s background.

Mr Werritty pays an estimated rent of more than £2,500 a month for his flat in Pimlico, a short walk from the Houses of Parliament. Last night a source told the Mail: ‘Mr Werritty has tried to get the agents to reduce the rent on the property but has been told that it is not possible.’

Mr Werritty has run a string of companies. He started UK Health Ltd when Dr Fox was shadow health secretary but this was dissolved and he founded Security Futures in 2006 after his friend moved to the defence brief. This company ceased trading last year but its last accounts revealed a pre-tax profit of just £4,000.

Mr Werritty also started Danscottia Consulting Ltd in 2007 but the latest accounts show an £8,000 loss last year. His other company is Todiha Ltd was formed in February.

Another venture is the Atlantic Bridge Education and Research Scheme, a think-tank founded by Dr Fox in 1997. Mr Werritty was the sole employee of the charity, which was wound up last month after the Charity Commission ruled it was not meeting its ‘charitable purposes’.

The charity’s accounts show it paid £37,000 for an annual salary to an unnamed individual. It also paid consultancy fees of £87,738 over three years to Mr Werritty.
