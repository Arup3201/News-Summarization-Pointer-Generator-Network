Maximo Caminero, 51, plead guilty to criminal mischief for breaking a $1 million vase in an exhibit by famous Chinese artist Ai Wei Wei

A jealous artist who smashed Chinese Artist Ai Weiwei's $1 million vase at a museum in February 'as a political act' was found guilty of criminal mischief.

Maximo Caminero, a 51-year-old artist from the Dominican Republic, will serve 100 hours of community service by teaching children how to paint and will be put on 18 months probation.

The New York Times reports that Caminero must also pay $10,000 to Ai Weiei for the vase he broke at the Perez Art Museum in Miami, Florida.

'I think about what I did every day and I find it hard to live with what I did because it still haunts me,' Caminero said in a public apology.

'I know I have a debt to our society and I accept responsibility for my actions, but I ask you to give me an opportunity to redeem myself through working in the community as a way to make amends for my actions.'

Caminero says he broke the vase as a political act and a way to attract attention to the lack of local artists showcasing their art.

Caminero could have faced as many as five years in prison but the museum agreed to waive his sentence for community service.

'What I did was not good,' Mr. Caminero said.

'But I hope it serves to persuade others — including Ai Weiwei — not to do what I did.'

According
 to the arrest affidavit from February, Caminero picked up the ancient 
vase painted over by Weiwei and a security guard told him to put it 
down.

Instead,
 Caminero smashed the vase on the floor and 'spontaneously told [police]
 that he broke the vase in protest of local artists and that the museum 
only displayed international artists.'

Caminero
 had been working as a painter for 30 years and he was frustrated 
that local artists like himself aren't showcased in Miami-area art 
museums.

'I did it for all the local artists in Miami that have never been shown in museums here,' Caminero told the Miami New Times back in February.

'They have spent so many millions now on international artists. It's the same political situation over and over again. I've been here for 30 years and it's always the same.'

Caminero plans to hold a press conference Tuesday afternoon to 'answer all the questions'.

The police affidavit lists the value of the vase as $1 million - but Caminero said he had no idea it was that valuable and feels sorry for damaging such an expensive relic.

'If you saw the vases on display and the way they were painted there was no way one would think the artist had painted over an ancient artifact,' Caminero said.

'Instead I thought it was a common clay pot like you would find at Home Depot, frankly.'

In addition to being a work of art by a famous artist, the vase is ancient and could be as much as 7,000 years old.

Weiwei is arguably China's most famous artist, and probably best known for having designed the Bird's Nest Olympic stadium in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics.   

Artist and political activist: A sculptor, designer and documentary-maker, Ai Weiwei has irked Beijing by using his art and online profile to draw attention to injustices in China and the need for greater transparency and rule of law

A sculptor, designer and documentary-maker, Weiwei has irked Beijing by using his art and online profile to draw attention to injustices in China and the need for greater transparency and rule of law.

He was detained for 81 days in 2011 during crackdown on dissent. After his release in June 2011, Ai's design firm was slapped with a $2.4million tax bill, which he fought unsuccessfully in the Chinese courts.

According to museum's web site, the vase is one of more than a dozen that are part of a floor installation. Each vase is partially painted in bright colors.

'I was at PAMM and saw Ai Weiwei's photos behind the vases where he drops an ancient Chinese vase and breaks it. And I saw it as a provocation by Weiwei to join him in an act of performance protest.'

Caminero has shown his art at the Gallery in West Palm Beach that offered a patrons a chance to meet him and 'view a sampling of the work from his 30-year career as an artist.'
