They may have failed to set White Hart Lane alight last season, but Tottenham forwards Erik Lamela and Roberto Soldado have been on fire during pre-season.

Both players were brought in as part of Spurs' recruitment drive to replace Gareth Bale last summer but struggled to justify their price tags. 

However, each found the target again as Tottenham thrashed Celtic 6-1 in Helsinki on Saturday - taking their pre-season goal tallies to three apiece.

Following such sizzling form, Lamela posted a picture of the pair cooling down after training while sharing smiles that Tottenham fans will hope set the tone for the new campaign.

King Erik? The 22-year-old Argentine has caught the eye of Mauricio Pochettino during pre-season

Making up for lost time: Roberto Soldado has raised his game by scoring three goals during pre-season

The 22-year-old was signed for  £25.7m from Roma but made only three league starts under Andre Villas-Boas due to a series of injuries and difficulties adapting to life in London. 

Soldado also had an uninspiring first season in north London, scoring only six league goals following his £26million move from Valencia.

But, both have caught the eye of new manager Mauricio Pochettino who is determined to restore their reputations as some of the most exciting talents in Europe..

Speaking of Lamela, he said: ‘We know the Erik Lamela from Argentina and Italy. But he is still young and the Premier League is the most difficult league to play; the style, the language.

Season to forget: Erik Lamela's statistics from last season make for unimpressive reading

Flop: The former Valencia striker only managed six league goals following his £26m move last season

‘But after one year we believe that Erik is ready to show his quality.

‘Will he play as a No 10 or out wide? It depends on the situation. My philosophy is to give a freer style with good organisation but not only with Erik; with other players as well.’

Soldado is desperate to prove himself in the Premier League, despite Spanish newspaper Marca reporting that Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone is interested in taking him back to La Liga.
