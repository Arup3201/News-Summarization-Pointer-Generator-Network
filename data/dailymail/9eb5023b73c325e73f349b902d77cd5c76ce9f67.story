A mystery blaze at a specialist car dealership has destroyed a £100,000 fleet of unique and valuable classic Land Rovers.

Fire crews were called out  to the Land Rover Centre in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, a leading supplier of restored Land Rovers.

After breaking through the entrance gates the two crews found the fire in the covered parking area containing the vehicles.

The damage caused by a fire at the Land Rover Centre in Huddersfield. The blaze has caused an estimated £100,000 worth of damage

Four of the six vehicles on site, dating from 1968 and 1979, were worth around £20,000 each

The structure’s fibre-glass roof melted and dripped onto the iconic cars underneath, igniting them and destroying the interiors.

In some instances the heat was so intense it melted some sections of the cars’ aluminium bodywork.

Four of the six vehicles on site, dating from 1968 and 1979 and worth around £20,000 each, were completely destroyed along with the parking area.

Company founder Peter Garside said: 'The Land Rovers damaged were either Series 2 or 2a classic Land Rovers, and there was one Series 3.

Fire crews had to break through the entrance gates to tackle the blaze

'The Fire Service and the police have both had a look and they don’t know how it started, the sheets on the roof went up and something set them on fire.

'The fire has destroyed a lot of hard work. It takes about three weeks to build each one up from the chassis and we can’t just go out and replace the parts.

'We have to look far and wide for them.'

Sales Manager Mark Griffiths, 52, arrived at the premises to discover firefighters dousing the last of the flames

West Yorkshire Police said they are investigating the blaze at the Land Rover Centre as a potential arson attack

Sales Manager Mark Griffiths, 52, received a phone call at 5.15am and arrived at the premises to discover firefighters dousing the last of the flames.

He said: 'The scene was horrendous and it was quite a shock. Usually when we get a call from the alarm company there is a spider in one of the sensors or something similar.

'Each vehicle is unique. We strip them down and build from the ground up and, sadly, I think four or five of them are beyond repair.

'There was a one-vehicle gap between the parked Land Rovers and our main building which would definitely have gone up if we’d have had one there, so we’ve been very lucky from that point of view.

'A lot of us have been here a long time. We are like a family company so there is a sombre mood and a sense of shock. Luckily we are a strong business, so we will survive.'

A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said   they are investigating the blaze at the Land Rover Centre as a potential arson attack.
