Britain's borders are ‘like a sieve’, a senior judge declared yesterday as he warned Romanian criminals not to come to Britain on January 1.

The Recorder of Lincoln, Judge Sean Morris, raised the prospect that the courts could face a surge of foreign offenders when controls on Romania and Bulgaria are abandoned 13 days from now.

He expressed frustration at delays of six months and longer to obtain criminal records from the Romanian authorities and called on ministers to do something about it. His comments came as he delayed sentencing of a Romanian woman who was part of a gang which targeted elderly men using cash machines.

He delayed sentencing Romanian thief Nicoleta Bala - who was part of a gang targeting elderly men - at Lincoln Crown Court (pictured) until he had received her criminal record from her native country

He said he would not sentence Nicoleta Bala – who now has a child born in Britain – until he received her criminal history from her home country. He said any Romanian criminals would ‘languish’ in prison awaiting sentence until he knew what their criminal past was.

‘You can get in and out of this country. The borders are like a sieve,’ he told Lincoln Crown Court.

‘I do not deal with foreign criminals without knowing whether  they have been in trouble in their own country.

‘If the fact is that people come over here from Romania to commit crime they cannot complain.

‘The message can go out that I will not deal with these people until I have full knowledge about their background. The lesson is – don’t come here and commit crime.’

On the delays in obtaining records he added: ‘It really is in the political sphere. Something has to be done.

‘I don’t know if we are going to have a lot of new customers. This is  something that the police at a senior level, the Home Office and the  Ministry of Justice are going to have to take up.’

Bala, 28, who lives in Leicester, was in a gang which stole PINs and bank cards from elderly men using cash machines in the Midlands.

She admitted two distraction thefts 
in Grantham and Stoke on Trent in November 2008, only months after 
entering Britain using a Romanian ID card. After committing the crimes 
she left the country but was arrested on her return at Folkestone.

Police
 requested her past convictions in September but do not expect a 
response until the New Year, the court heard. Both of Bala’s theft 
victims have since died, prosecutor Andrew Scott said.

He
 told the court: ‘Unlike the East European Baltic states, Romania is not
 one of the most efficient member states in relation to bilateral 
co-operation.’

Judge said British borders were like a 'sieve' and said something has to be done at a 'senior level' (file picture)

This week 
it emerged that British police travelled to Romania to discourage young 
men from coming to this country to commit crime.

Even those who arrive intending to work can find themselves drawn in to petty crimes such as begging and pick-pocketing.

Last
 week it emerged that Romanians are seven times more likely to be 
arrested in London in Britons. They account for more than 11 per cent of
 all foreign offenders, despite making up just a tiny proportion of 
residents. Last year, Romanians accounted for 49 per cent of all arrests
 for begging and for 34 per cent of arrests for pickpocketing in the 
capital.

The Recorder of Lincoln, His Honour 
Judge Sean Morris, was widely applauded in 2011 after handing a violent 
burglar a 15-year sentence.

He
 tore up the normal sentencing guidelines for professional criminal and 
heroin addict Leonard Johnston for three serious break-ins and assaults 
on two of his victims.

One of the victims died two months later.

The
 judge told Johnston that short prison and community sentences had 
failed and he would be ‘out of circulation for a long, long time in 
order to protect people’.

Elderly people should, he said, be able to live in ‘safety and dignity’.

The judge who is 55, was born in Bingley, West Yorkshire.

He attended Benton Park Grammar School and Leeds Polytechnic then specialised as a criminal barrister.

He has been a judge since 2003 and Recorder of Lincoln since 2011.

In Who’s Who he lists his hobbies as ‘beer and curry’.
