The world’s first sensory restaurant for babies, which aims to encourage healthy eating from a young age, has opened its doors today.

With the aim of helping mothers and fathers 
introduce their little ones to healthy eating habits early on, the Weeny Weaning Restaurant aims to help 
families make mealtimes fun through sensory play and expert advice.

The restaurant in Clapham features a dedicated sensory area where mini diners are encouraged to play and explore before taking their seats to tuck in.

'If you can involve your little ones in the food preparation process, such as giving them veggies and fruits to play with, it will make them more engaged from the start,' explained  Consultant Infant Nutritionist Claire Baseley.

'Letting them see, touch and smell the food will make them feel involved and in return they will be more likely to try new tastes.'

Babies are then encouraged to try new flavours, in order to encourage them to discover and accept new foods and tastes, in the 'taste zone'.

Little ones will be seated in highchairs at interactive tables, from which they will be able to choose from their very own digital menu, allowing them to select their own mains and desserts. 

Creators say that the colourful interactive menu features state-of-the-art technology, designed to be ideal for little fingers to tap and touch.

'The interactive menu is another great 
way of generating that important sensory engagement, by using visuals of
 fruit and vegetables to introduce babies to the ingredients they are 
about to munch on.

'They are able to look at colours and shapes and 
engage their senses visually, which will make them more excited about new
 shapes, textures and foods they try,' said Claire.

Depending on the number of times they tap a particular food icon over a 30-second period, the digital menu responds accordingly and the waiters bring the children their selected choice of food, which has been developed with advice from child nutritionists.

Speaking about the new restaurant, Claire, who worked on the menu, added: 'We understand that mums and dads sometimes find mealtimes tricky, and that it can take quite a few tries to familiarise any hungry little ones with a new taste or texture.

'We also know that by introducing little ones’ taste buds to a wide variety of different and exciting tastes, it can help encourage them to grow up to be good little eaters.

'That’s why it’s super important to try to introduce little ones to new foods, especially savoury vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, every day during the first weeks of weaning.

How does it work? 'If you can involve your little ones in the food preparation process, such as giving them veggies and fruits to play with, it will make them more engaged from the start,' explained Consultant Infant Nutritionist Claire Baseley

'We hope our sensory restaurant encourages lots of little ones to try tastes and textures they may not have experienced before, and gives parents plenty of ideas and suggestions for fun ways to excite little ones’ senses and make mealtimes fun at home.'

Paul Lindley, Ella’s Dad and founder of Ella’s Kitchen, who are behind the restaurant, said: 'Since I set up Ella’s Kitchen, our mission has been to help create healthy relationships with food for little ones.

'The very first tastes babies try when starting out on the weaning journey are so important, so it’s our aim to make this experience as easy and enjoyable as possible for both parents and little ones.

'That’s why we’re delighted to open this innovative weeny weaning restaurant, which helps babies get used to trying lots of delicious new flavours in a really fun, sensorial way.'
