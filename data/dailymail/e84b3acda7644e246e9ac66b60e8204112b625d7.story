iPhone covers shaped like knuckledusters that sold in their thousands after Rihanna was seen using one have been banned from eBay in case they are used to attack people.

The £25 aluminium case became a celebrity must-have after the singer was pictured with hers last year.

But eBay has removed the web pages of sellers, saying the cases are legally classed as weapons and breach its guidelines.

However, flimsier plastic versions are still for sale.

iPhone covers shaped like knuckledusters that sold in their thousands after Rihanna (pictured) was seen using one have been banned from eBay in case they are used to attack people

The £25 aluminium phone case is shaped like a knuckleduster, with four holes for fingers to slip through. Phones then fit inside a metal frame which is attached to the knuckleduster design

One trader who sold hundreds said: ‘Everyone wanted one.

'The knuckle case had been selling really well because everyone wanted one like Rihanna’s.

'They’re really stylish but because they’re shaped like a knuckleduster, they’re classed as a weapon.

'I received an email from eBay saying that the auction violated their guidelines and the listing was immediately suspended.

'I’m sure Rihanna only looks at is as a fashion accessory and has no idea that it’s linked to being a weapon.'

The seller - who asked to remain anonymous - received a message from eBay which said the knuckle case came under the ‘Firearms, Weapons, and Knives’ category.

It said the iPhone case was defined by Section 141 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (UK).

Phones then fit inside a metal frame which is attached to the knuckleduster design.

A second seller whose listings were also removed added: 'It’s such a shame because the profit margins on those little beauties were incredible.”

Plastic versions have not yet been removed. It is believed this is because they are not considered as dangerous.

The cases banned from eBay are all manufactured in China and are copies of the original ‘Knucklecase’ brand sported by Rihanna.
