University of New Mexico law student Jeremy Martin says that an overzealous police officer kneed him in the groin so viciously during a routine traffic stop that he lost a testicle.

Martin, 24, was driving a carload of friends after midnight on Friday when a police officer pulled him over claiming he ran a stop sign.

A police report filed by an officer Padilla claimed that Martin appeared to be intoxicated and admitted to having three beers.

Martin went through a series of field sobriety tests then the officer asked him to sit on the curb. However, according to the report, Martin resisted.

Martin's attorney, Sam Bregman, told KOB4 that the officer reacted in the worst possible way.

'This officer felt the necessity to knee him so 
directly and with so much blunt force that it shattered his testicle,' he said.

Martin was booked on misdemeanor charges of marijuana possession and DWI.

His face is visibly injured in his mug shot, and while the police report mentions those injuries it does not mention his testicle.

'He was taken to Presbyterian Hospital where he had emergency surgery to have his testicle removed,' Bregman said.

Bregman is now filing suit against the officers involved.Â

'How does a DWI investigation with a first year law 
student -- when he absolutely did nothing to provoke the officer -- 
result in the shattering of his testicle and emergency surgery to remove
 it?' Bregman asked.

In Bregman's favor is that the police report contains several inconsistencies.

Besides omitting the testicle injury, the report claims Bregman went through a stop sign while traveling north on Wellesley Place, but it's impossible to travel north on that street and reach the stop sign in question.
