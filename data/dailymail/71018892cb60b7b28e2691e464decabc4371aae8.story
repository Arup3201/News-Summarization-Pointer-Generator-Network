A dying man was left receiving electric shocks to his heart for several hours from a 'zapper' implant that doctors didn't know how to switch off.

Francis Woods, 67, died at home after a short battle with tonsil cancer, but medics failed to turn off his Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) for several hours.

The 'heart-zapper' implant delivers life-saving electric shocks if it detects an irregular heart rate - but can cause painful jolts when left active in dying patients.

Francis Woods (with wife Eileen) continued receiving painful electric shocks to his heart for several hours from a 'zapper' implant that medics didn't know how to switch off

An out-of-hours GP came to Mr Woods' house in Partington, Greater Manchester, after he had discharged himself from St Ann's Hospice in Heald Green, Stockport - but didn't know how to deactivate the device.

The implant had been installed at Wythenshawe Hospital but bosses admitted they couldn't provide the doctor with clear information on how to de-activate it.

The trust has its own guidelines for switching off ICDs on patients in hospital but they do not apply for patients who choose to die at home or in a hospice under the Liverpool Care Pathway.

Switching off the device involves 
holding a specialist magnet over the ICD, which temporarily closes a 
magnetic switch incorporated in it.

To turn it off permanently, the device has to then be reprogrammed remotely using a 'wand' attached to a computer.

The British Heart Foundation 
published official guidelines in 2009 recommending that health 
professionals have a 'responsibility' to ensure any implanted device is 
de-activated in patients close to the point of death.

Mr Woods, 67, died at home after a short battle with tonsil cancer, but medics failed to turn off his Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) for several hours, says his widow

Mr Woods' widow Eileen, 65, held talks 
with hospital chiefs following her husband's death in June 2011 and was 
told that new guidelines were being put in place to prevent such an 
incident happening again.

But two years on, the guidelines have yet to be implemented by the Greater Manchester and Cheshire Cardiac Network, which is responsible for integrating cardiac care between hospitals, GPs and other health organisations in the region.

Health bosses have admitted that 'more training and education' was needed and that re-organisation of the NHS had slowed down the introduction of official guidelines.

Mrs Woods says she has now complained after becoming frustrated that 'no lessons have been learned' from her husband's death two years ago.

Two years on, Mrs Woods is angry that guidelines put in place to prevent such an incident happening again have not been implemented

She said: 'My main concern after his death was to make sure this wouldn't happen to other patients and I was satisfied at the time because I felt my concerns would help shape this new policy. But there seems to have been next to no movement on the issue and now I feel like I was just being kept quiet.

'From my experience these guidelines are badly needed and it shocks me that it's taken so long.

'Because my husband was unconscious, I can't know if he was experiencing pain - I'll never know - but it's not something that should be allowed to happen.

'It was his choice and his right to die at home, but after making that decision we were not given the support we needed to make sure he was allowed a peaceful passing.'

A Wythenshawe Hospital spokesman said:'"Our ICD specialist nurse discussed deactivation of the ICD with the hospice. Mr Woods was sent home before this happened, and then deteriorated.

'A physician attended his home and contacted the hospital, but could not get the clearest of information [from the hospital] about magnet application to deactivate the ICD as this took place out of hours.

'The new guidelines from the network will give clearer details for physicians about magnet application, and where to get these magnets if necessary. The intention is that the ICDs are switched off before the patient gets to this stage.'

A spokeswoman for the Greater Manchester
 and Cheshire Cardiac Network said: 'The network has been working on an 
implementation plan and the intention is to launch the policy over the 
coming months and work with clinicians to agree how they will take it 
forward.'Â
