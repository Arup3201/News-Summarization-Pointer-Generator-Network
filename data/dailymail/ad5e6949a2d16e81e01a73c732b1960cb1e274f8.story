'Pot princess' Kayla Mendoza, 21, was charged with DUI manslaughter on Monday in Florida

A self-proclaimed 'pothead princess' who tweeted '2 drunk 2 care' hours before she killed two young women was charged on Monday with causing their deaths.

Kayla Mendoza, 21, was wheeled into Broward County Jail, Florida on a stretcher as she is still recovering from injuries five months after the crash which killed Marisa Catronio and Kaitlyn Ferrante, both 21.

Mendoza covered her face with a sheet while the families of the victims gathered outside the prison gates.

Mendoza faces two counts of DUI 
manslaughter while impaired, two counts of DUI manslaughter with an 
unlawful blood-alcohol level, two counts of vehicular homicide and two 
counts of driving without a license and causing death.

Her blood-alcohol level was twice the legal limit at the time of the 2am crash, according to highway patrol. She also had traces of marijuana in her system.

The 21-year-old sales assistant is being held without bond. Mendoza suffered a brain injury and broken legs in the crash.

The grieving families said on Monday they were glad to see Mendoza being brought to justice.

Miss Ferrante's mother Christine Ferrante told the Sun-Sentinel that she believed Mendoza covered her face so she would not have to look at them.

However she added: 'All this time I wanted to see those gates close behind her, and now I have.'

Family members said that waiting so long to see Mendoza charged has been difficult but that they understood investigators had a complex task and wanted to be certain there were no legal loopholes.

On the night of the crash, 20-year-old Mendoza had been drinking at the Tijuana Taxi Company in Coral Springs.

Around 8pm, she tweeted the words '2 drunk 2 care' - just hours before climbing into her car and  allegedly causing the horrific wrong-way crash on the Sawgrass Expressway.

Marisa Catronio was pronounced dead at the scene around 2am on November 17 last year. Kaitlyn Ferrante was taken to hospital but died from her injuries four days later.  

The best friends had been heading 
home to Coral Springs in Miss Ferrante's 2012 Toyota Camry after a night
 out when they were struck by a Hyundai Sonata driven by Mendoza, police
 said.

Less than three hours before the wrong-way crash on November 17 last year, Mendoza tweeted that she was '2 drunk 2 care'

Mendoza was heading east in the 
westbound lanes when she slammed head-on into Catronio's red Camry 
driven by Ferrante, west of University Drive.

The two friends were out celebrating Miss Catronio's 21st birthday.

Mendoza was not shy about her drug and alcohol use on her social media accounts.  Posting
 under the user name 'Kaila Mendoza,' the T-Mobile sales associate had 
fired off dozens of tweets about being high and rolling joints.

In the weeks leading up to the crash, Mendoza tweeted that her 'car permanently smells like weedâ€™ and boasted about 'rolling a blunt in the airport parking lot'.
