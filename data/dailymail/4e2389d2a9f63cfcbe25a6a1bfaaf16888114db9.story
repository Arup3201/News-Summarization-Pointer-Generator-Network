The publishers of bestseller He Who Must be Obeid admit that the authors made an error and accused an innocent man of being involved in business with Eddie Obeid and two of his children.

Although Eddie Obeid and his Obeid children were in business with a Christopher Brown, the book places the blame on a well-respected Sydney businessman who happens to have the same name.

The authors, Fairfax journalist Kate McClymont and ABC reporter Linton Besser, clearly link the wrong man to the Obeids. They accuse Christopher Brown AM, member of the general division of the Order of Australia, Sydney tourism advocate and the son of former Labor MP, John Brown.

The implicated Mr Brown says his reputation has been sullied and told 2UE radio that, ‘simple homework checking would have stopped the damage to me and my family.’

Mr Brown claims it took him four minutes and $19 to prove the error, using the ASIC search website.

Co-authors Kate McClymont and Linton Besser pose for a photograph in the former parliamentary office of Eddie Obeid, following their the launch of their book at the NSW State Parliament building, in Sydney on Wednesday, July 30, 2014. The book, entitled He Who Must Be Obeid, is a non-fiction account of business dealings of former NSW Labor Minister Eddie Obeid. It has since been revealed that they misidentified businessman, Christopher Brown in the expose.

The exposé was withdrawn from sale yesterday after an injunction was placed on the book by Mr Brown, amid warnings of legal action.

The publisher, Random House confirm the imputation of the wrong man and say amended copies of the books will be on sale within the week.

‘The book contained misidentification and that was included in error,’ Random House marketing and publicity director Brett Osmond told Daily Mail on Thursday.

‘We have acted quickly to ensure the small amount of text that required a rewrite has indeed been rewritten to correct the error. A reprint will be in stores next week.'

Christopher Brown was accused of being in business with Eddie Obeid's son Paul (pictured left, with his brother Moses leaving the ICAC hearing in April this year) and daughter Fiona.

Mr Brown has hired defamation lawyer, Mark O’Brien and is demanding a public apology, after he was accused of being in business with two of Eddie Obeid’s children, Paul and Fiona.

‘I’m still sitting here waiting for a phone call from the journalist who haven’t bothered to say sorry despite one of the worst cases of defamation in a long, long time.

‘These books sit on people’s bookshelves for 40 years. Every time someone picks the book up, it says I’m a crook,’ Mr Brown told 2UE Radio.

Mr Brown is the Chairman of Taylor Street Advisory and was Managing Director of the Tourism & Transport forum for almost 20 years.

Mr Brown also serves on various Government boards and is a Fairfax media contributor.

'My legal team has injuncted the book, had it forced off the bookshelves to be pulped, a new edition to have corrections included, with public apologies to be issued in due course for damages obviously to be lodged,' Mr Brown told ABC Radio.

Ms McClymont, who was covering the latest NSW corruption inquiry, tweeted on Thursday a formal apology would be made.

She wrote: "#icac media room helpfully offering suggestions re any new version of He Who Must Be Obeid. Formal apology to come re mistaken identity (sic)."

Dymocks Bookstore on Sydney's George Street confirmed on Thursday all copies of the book had been removed from its shelves.

An employee said about 150 copies were taken down, adding that the book had been selling well since it was released last month.

The book was listed as number one independent book bestseller as of the week ending August 2, according to Nielsen BookScan.
