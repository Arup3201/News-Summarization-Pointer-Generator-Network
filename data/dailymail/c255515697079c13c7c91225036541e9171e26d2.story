With padded wings and a 'halo', it can make even the most mischievous dog look angelic

But this device  has another, more practical use - it gives blind canines a new lease of life.

The eye-catching contraption, dubbed 'Muffin's Halo', aims to protect dogs who are either entirely blind or seriously visually impaired from running into walls, furniture and other objects.

Silvie Bordeaux created 'Muffin's Halo' in 2012 after her 13-year-old Toy Poodle Muffin lost his eyesight and started running into walls and falling down the stairs at their home in Los Angeles.

She was reportedly 'heartbroken' and 'determined to find a solution for her beloved dog', so carried out weeks of research before launching the device in a bid to help Muffin and other blind pets.

Safe from harm: Speaking of the product, Ms Bordeaux, a publicist, wrote: 'The halo is just above the eye level and acts as a buffer to safeguard a dog's head, nose, face and shoulders from bumping into surfaces'

Speaking of the product, Ms Bordeaux, a publicist, wrote: 'The halo is just above the eye level and acts as a buffer to safeguard a dog's head, nose, face and shoulders from bumping into hard surfaces.

'When the halo taps a hard surface, it sends a signal to the dog and they automatically go in a different direction. They catch on very fast and it is truly amazing to watch their confidence level rise.'

She added that she hoped 'Muffin's Halo' could help prevent a 'high number' of animals from being put down by their owners because they are blind or visually impaired.

Prices for 'Muffin's Halo' range between $63 and $118.
