A new vaccine against one of the most common stomach bugs contracted abroad could save the holiday for millions of travellers.

Dehli belly, also known as traveller’s stomach, affects around 10million people every year and up to half of all tourists suffer from it in some way.

The new vaccine targets both E. Coli bacteria and salmonella and has been produced by researchers at University of Cambridge.

The stomach virus is most commonly contracted by tourists in tropical countries such as India.

Delhi belly causes cramps, diahorrea, and, as a result, dehydration, and is caught by consuming contaminated food or water.

The vaccine comes in powder form and offers protection against enterotoxigenic E.Coli as well as typhoid.

‘The vaccine we have produced is a powder so it is very stable and does not need to be kept in cold storage,’ Prof Nigel Slater, who let the work to produce the vaccine, told The Telegraph.

‘Nor does it carry any of the problems associated with needles,’ he added, saying that now all it takes is swallowing a capsule and the stomach problem is solved.

Prof. Slater, who leads a team of scientists at University of Cambridge’s department of biochemical engineering and biotechnology, said clinical trials are due to start later this year.
