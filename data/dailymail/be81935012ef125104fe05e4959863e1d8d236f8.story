A nine-year-old boy became the youngest person ever to appear before Parliament today – and described it as being ‘like Hogwarts’.

Alex Rukin was petitioning a committee of MPs investigating the case for a new high-speed rail link between London, the Midlands and the North.

The primary school pupil has claimed the £40billion scheme will ‘ruin my life’ - because it will run past the back of his mother's home, spoiling his night's sleep.

Alexander Rukin, nine, appeared in Parliament today with his father Joe Rukin, who manages the Stop HS2 campaign

Alex, whose father manages the Stop HS2 campaign, told MPs the new rail line was a 'stupid idea'.

The young anti-high speed rail campaigner, who goes to Clinton School, in Kenilworth in Warwickshire, starred in a video last year informing people how to petition against HS2.

Alex, who spends half his time in Kenilworth with his father and the remaining time in Balsall Common with his mother, questioned why HS2 was being funded when his school has to ask parents to donate money.

Asked about what he thought of his famous surroundings in Westminster where he made history, Alex said: ‘It looks a lot like Hogwarts.’

Hogwarts is a fictional school of witchcraft and wizardry in the Harry Potter series of books.

In his petition against HS2 Alex claimed the project’s bosses were ‘cheating on their sums’.

He said: ‘People at HS2 Ltd are really, really bad at maths and make things up that aren’t true, your petitioner is worried that HS2 will cost lots more than the people are saying.

‘Your petitioner has been told that saying things which are not true is naughty, so does not understand why the HS2 people say things that are not true and get given lots of money.’

Alex’s father, and Stop HS2 Campaign manager, Joe Rukin (right) said his son was the 'youngest person to have ever appeared in an official capacity before parliament'

Alex’s father, and Stop HS2 Campaign manager, Joe Rukin said: ‘As far as we can tell Alex will become the youngest person to have ever appeared in an official capacity before parliament. This makes sense to me, as apart from the specific instance of Hybrid Bill committees, I can’t think of any case when someone that young would have the opportunity, apart from maybe Edward VI.

‘After I explained what petitioning was, he said he thought everyone in the whole country should be doing it, He is committed to doing something about something he thinks is wrong, and I’m really proud about that.’
