Actor Randy Quaid and his wife Evgenia are suing John Kerry and the State Department to recover passports that the government revoked three years ago.

The State Department said it takes U.S. passports for reasons including issuance of a felony arrest warrant, fraud, failure to pay child support or a criminal court order barring departure from the country.

Randy Quaid said the revocation involved an issue over 'an insurance policy that we did not take out,' but declined to discuss it further.

'We can't go anywhere,' Quaid said.

'Randy can't take a film job,' said Evgenia Quaid. 'He had to turn down the Cannes Film Festival last year. We can't proceed with our life.'

The Quaids have had a string of legal problems, including accusations of vandalism of a home they once owned and a California felony warrant issued over an unpaid hotel tab.

The couple applied for refugee status in Canada in October 2010, saying they were being persecuted by a group of devious lawyers and agents bent on killing famous actors.

The pair relocated north of the U.S. border at the time, jumping bail and skipping court dates in Santa Barbara, California, where they face felony and misdemeanor counts in connection with vandalizing a home they once owned.

$500,000 bench warrants are still in effect for the couple in Santa Barbara.

The Quaids told authorities that their friends including Heath Ledger and David Carradine had died under ‘mysterious circumstances. 

Randy Quaid is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid. He is best-known for his roles in films such as 'National Lampoon's Vacation' and 'Independence Day.' 

He won a Golden Globe award - which he brought to court during one of his appearances in the innkeeper case - for his depiction of President Lyndon Johnson in a TV movie in the late 1980s. 

He was also nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar in 1973 for his role in 'The Last Detail.'
