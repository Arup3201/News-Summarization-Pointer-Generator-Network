Dr Richard Keller, 56, of Andover, knowingly received films depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct

A doctor who worked as the medical 
director of the prestigious Phillips Academy boarding school pleaded 
guilty on Monday to child pornography charges.

Richard Keller, of Andover, pleaded 
guilty to two counts of receiving and one count of possessing child 
pornography.

Under the agreement, Keller, the former 
medical director at the elite academy in Andover, acknowledged 
purchasing child pornography from a Canadian company and having some of 
it sent to the student health center.

Phillips Academy's alumni include former
presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush.

The case began with an investigation 
of an oversea's movie production company that offered films featuring 
naked young boys having food fights, wrestling, showering together and 
playing Twister.

When 
investigators accessed the company website and reviewed film previews 
and summaries, one of the videos was described as: 'We bring you 
action-packed discs of ooey-gooey slippery goodness.

'This two set disc 
features (name) and his buddies going commando in a very unique way.

'They're
sweet enough but that didn't stop them from breaking out sugary 
cupcakes and giving you a whole new perspective on nudist food 
fighting.'

The pediatric 
endocrinologist's account showed that between January 2009 and July 
2011, he ordered titles on 19 separate occasions, spending $2,695.

As part of the agreement, Keller 
acknowledged that he has had a sexual interest in adolescents since the 
early 1970s.

Keller worked as the 
school's medical director for 19 years until the academy failed to renew
his contract in 2011.

In a written agreement filed in court on Monday, Keller also 
acknowledged viewing child pornography on the Internet and 'that he has 
previously tried to stop, but failed to do so'.

Keller, 57, did not speak during a court
hearing in Boston, except to answer questions from U.S. District Judge 
Dennis Saylor IV.

Concerns: Keller was placed on immediate leave from Boston Children's Hospital Boston pending an investigation

He kept his hands folded under his 
chin as Assistant U.S. Attorney Stacy Dawson Belf described the charges 
against him, including an allegation that he purchased videos and images
from a Toronto company on 19 different occasions between 2009 and 2011.

The videos and images depicted boys engaged in sexually explicit 
conduct.

Belf said Keller was identified through 
the company's database after federal postal inspectors began an 
investigation into the company in 2012.

She said that more than 500 
high-gloss printouts and 60 to 100 DVDs of child porn were found during a
search of Keller's home.

His lawyer, Max Stern, declined to comment after the hearing. Prosecutors also declined to comment.

John Palfrey, the head of school at 
Phillips Academy, said in an email to students and parents after 
Keller's arrest that the decision to not renew Keller's contract was 
based on professional misconduct unrelated to the federal case.

Palfrey 
said Keller had been reprimanded in 1999 for using a school computer to 
access adult pornography and had shown an inappropriate cartoon to 
students in 2002.

Keller also worked as a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital in Boston and taught at Harvard Medical School.

Under the terms of a plea agreement, Keller's attorney and 
federal prosecutors recommended a sentence of between five years, three 
months and six-and-a-half years.

Sentencing is scheduled for February 27.
