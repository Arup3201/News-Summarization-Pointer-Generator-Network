A Texas paramedic who helped evacuate people in the minutes following the  fertilizer plant explosion that killed 14 at West, Texas, has been charged with possessing bomb-making materials, including a pipe and chemicals.

Bryce Reed, 31, is in police custody and did not enter a plea during his appearance in court this afternoon.

Sheriff's deputies were called earlier this week to a home near West where they found a pipe, chemicals and fuses. They say the objects belonged to Reed.

His arrest came just hours before police launched a criminal investigation into the blast.

Reed was one of the first to arrive at the catastrophic explosion and helped recover the injured. He was assigned to be the incident commander at the scene.

In the days following the tragedy he spoke at 
the memorial of those who were killed.

According to sources, Reed is also said to have asked an co-worker to store a box for him sometime after the explosion.

That person later found what appeared to be a pipe bomb in the container, and then contacted police.

In recent days the sister of the man he eulogized has come forward to say she thinks her brother never even knew the paramedic and his Facebook page features him angrily denying that he has ‘profited’ from the tragedy.

In custody: Bryce Reed, a volunteer EMS worker who frequently spoke with the media during the aftermath of the West explosion, was detained and faces a charge of possession of a destructive device.

According to an affidavit released by the federal court in Waco, the McLennan County Sheriff's Office was called on Tuesday to home in Abbott, which is near West, about 'a possible destructive device' and related items.

The affidavit said that law enforcement officials determined that the device and related items belonged to Reed.

The material is described as a 3.5-inch galvanized metal pipe an inch and a half in diameter. Two galvanized end caps were attached to the pipe. One end cap had a small hole drilled into it.

Canisters containing a fuse, a lighter, six coils of metal ribbon and several pounds of chemical powders were also found.

The powders were described as potassium nitrate, aluminum powder, red iron oxide, ammonium perchlorate, sulfur powder and other materials.

The affidavit said that the materials had been left in the home by Reed on April 26, but the person at the home did not know what had been left.

Potassium nitrate is used in fertilizers and can also be used in fireworks and gunpowder.

Aluminum powder, potassium nitrate and sulfur are common ingredients in flash powder. The affidavit said ATF explosives and chemistry experts determined that the materials 'can be readily assembled into a destructive device.'

On his LinkedIn profile, Reed said he spent time at the U.S. Biological and Chemical Weapon Depot in Ft McClellan, Alabama.

Reed also lists one year from 2010-2011 as a technician/regional safety officer for Allied International Emergency LLC., where he said response teams dealt with 'Weapons of Mass Destruction Response, Nuclear Event Management, Chemical or Biological Weapons Containment, Large Scale Environmental Loss Mitigation, to DOT/EPA small scale spill cleanup...'

Reed, who acted as the town's spokesman in the aftermath of the blast, had a court appearance in Waco today and will remain in custody until a further hearing on Wednesday.

At this point, agents have not connected the arrest to the April 17 West Fertilizer Company explosion that killed 15, including 12 first responders.

Reed was arrested around 2 a.m. this morning and was booked into McLennan County Jail before being taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals.

As a volunteer EMS worker, Reed was placed on leave immediately after the explosion on April 17th.

He was also frequently interviewed in the days following the blast.

He told the L.A. Times
a heartbreaking story about heading to a close friend's house only for them to tell 
him that their son Cyrus Reed (no relation) had died in the explosion.

He also spoke extensively with The Dallas 
Morning News about his experiences during the tragedy and his difficulty 
coping afterwards.

Speaker: Bryce Reed was a paramedic who essentially became a spokesperson for the town of West after last month's deadly explosion at a fertilizer facility

Charged: Bryce Reed, a first responder at the fertilizer plant blast in West, Texas, is facing a charge of possession of a destructive device

At last month’s public memorial for the 12 people EMT personnel killed responding to the fire, Reed gave a heartfelt and often humorous eulogy to his 'close friend' Cyrus Reed.

Bryce said that he and his wife Brittany Reed were listening to music at their home when they heard the town's siren and jumped into their truck to warn people nearby.

'Get your kids and go!' the couple said they yelled at residents of an apartment complex near the plant.

They said they were about 50 to 75 yards from the plant when the blast rocked their car.

Reed also said that his home was destroyed and that he had lost his best friend, volunteer firefighter Cyrus Reed, in the blast.

The two are not related, but were so close they considered each other brothers.

'There's no words to convey the magnitude of this incident,' Reed he said at the time.

In a video that aired at the memorial, Bryce Reed said Cyrus lived life to the fullest.

He also said Cyrus also loved fire and was known for backyard high jinks that included shooting BB guns at pressurized cans of processed cheese.

'He would giggle and then proceed to plead his case and say, ‘You don’t understand, it was like 15 feet in the air and it spun and it was so cool,’ Bryce Reed said at the April 25 memorial in Waco that was attended by Gov. Rick Perry and President Barack Obama. 

However, Sarah Reed, who is Cyrus Reed’s biological sister, said her family had been 'fooled by Bryce Reed.' She told the Dallas Morning News that she let Bryce Reed eulogize her brother because he led them to believe that he and Cyrus Reed were very close.

Sarah Reed says that she has gone through Cyrus Reed's computer and cellphone records and have found that the two first responders might not have been as close as the suspect led the public to believe.

'He convinced us that he and Cyrus were very close, like brothers,' she said. 'But I want people to know they are not brothers, and he is not part of our family.'

Bryce Reed’s Facebook page indicates that some people may have accused him of profiting off of donations. He described this week as 'a trying one'.

On Monday he posted that he is 'appalled at how people are tearing me apart.' He mentions that his wife, Brittany, left him because he was 'lost in his own emotions'.

'I have not received ONE CENT for ANYTHING that I did to help with this situation,' Bryce Reed wrote the following day.

'I have not been paid by the media, by press, I made nothing for delivering my brothers eulogy, and made NOTHING off of this tragedy. I was a shoulder to cry on, I found a GREAT new family, and was blessed to get to tell them about their son.'

By Wednesday, Reed had decided to come off Facebook for a while: ' just wanted to tell everyone thank you for all the prayers and support. I'm going to take a break from Facebook to reflect. I assure you that I'm ok. God bless you all, and please if you heed nothing else I have said, love one another. '
