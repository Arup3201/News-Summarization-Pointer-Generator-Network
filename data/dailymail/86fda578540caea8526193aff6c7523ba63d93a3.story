Horrid: Jake Keating, 20, of Liverpool, said he found the body of a wasp in his Dairy Milk Bar

These shocking pictures show how a student discovered a wasp in his Cadbury Dairy Milk bar.

Jake Keating, 20, of Liverpool, claimed he found the body of the insect inside the chocolate bar after buying it in the city centre last week.

The construction management student at Liverpool John Moores University kept the bar, took a photograph of it and contacted Cadbury.

He said: ‘I was in the city centre when I unwrapped the bar and found this wasp inside.

'We kept the bar all day because I thought we should send it back.

'It was a whole wasp - it wasn’t like a bit of it, it still had both wings and the sting as well, which could still hurt someone I think. Cadbury’s sent someone round on Friday to collect it.’

A Cadbury spokesman said: ‘This certainly sounds unpleasant for Mr Keating and we have asked for the bar to be returned to us.

‘Once we have the bar back we will carry out an investigation to see where and when this could have occurred.’

Dairy Milk was first introduced in Britain in 1905 and the bars contain 23 per cent cocoa solids.

The incident comes two months after a couple found a live fly buzzing around inside a sealed bowl of mashed potato 
which they had just bought from a supermarket.

Chris
 and Hayley Rice were about to pierce the lid of the Sainsbury's product
 when the saw the insect crawling around. They had bought it at the West
 Green branch outside Crawley, West Sussex.

And
 last June, a 21-year-old man opened a bacon, lettuce and tomato 
sandwich he had bought at a petrol station - and bit into a lump of old 
chewing gum.

Alex Moughton 
said he felt sick after buying the pre-packaged BLT from the Co-op 
petrol station in Hopton, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on his way to 
work.
