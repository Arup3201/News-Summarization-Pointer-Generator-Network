One of Britain’s biggest charities has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on school fees for its chief executive’s children.

The high-profile Halo Trust, which clears landmines from war zones, was facing severe criticism last night after revelations that its founder, Guy Willoughby, had his annual bill of more than £70,000 covered for his children to attend some of the country’s most expensive boarding schools.

The charity rose to prominence in 1997 when Diana, Princess of Wales, visited a minefield it was clearing in Angola shortly before her death. Prince Harry is still a patron.

Last year its income was more than £26million, including £4million from the Department for International Development.

For more than a decade the Halo Trust - which was made famous after a visit by Princess Diana in 1997 - has given the go-ahead for the payments for Guy Willoughby's four children

According to the charity's latest accounts he receives a package of between £210,000 and £220,000 a year  - including the cost of sending his children to boarding schools.

Mr Willoughby's son is said to attend Oundle School in Northamptonshire - which charges £30, 705 a year for boarders -  and two of his daughters attend Queen Margaret’s School in York, which charges £27,825.

Queen Margaret's offers a discount for siblings, the Telegraph reports.

Mr Willoughby’s eldest child is now at university but her boarding school fees were once footed by the charity. 

Robert Halfon MP is a member of the Commons public administration committee which is investigating charity pay.

He said that charity chief executive salaries and perks should be displayed on their websites so people can decide whether they then want to donate.

Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative MP, added: 'Clearly, this is an outrageous abuse of charitable money. It highlights the need for better control of charities and greater respect for volunteer fund-raisers.'

Mr Willoughby, 53, co-founded Halo in 1988. It hit headlines when Princess Diana was pictured at a minefield in Angola, in 1997, shortly before she died.

He defended the charity's decision to pay his children's school fees to the paper highlighting  that the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office paid for the private education of children whose parents were posted overseas.

Mr Willoughby said that he often travelled overseas for work.

He said the charitable sector should pay salaries that would attract the best talent.

Staff who have worked for the charity for more than seven years are eligible for its school fees scheme, but there are just three members of staff which qualify, including Mr Willoughby.

The fees are paid for children between 10 and 18.

Mr Willoughby said:'The advantage to the Halo Trust of the remuneration package and the school fees allowance is actually that as employees [and their children] get older, it costs the charity less.'

The board of trustees for The HALO Trust said: 'Like some other charities and their senior executives, Guy is very much hands on and leads from the front putting his life in danger regularly, as he himself gets involved clearing landmines by hand, working, surveying and travelling in conflict and post-conflict countries such as Afghanistan, Colombia, Somalia, Angola, Sri Lanka and The West Bank.

'In 2013, Guy spent 60-70 per cent of the year working abroad to drive the charity’s goals and ambitions to rid the world of landmines.

'Our entire ethos as a charity is focused on efficiency and productivity to ensure that we achieve the maximum outcomes in the field and make the world a safer place.

'HALO’s beneficiaries and staff deserve and require a highly competent and professional management team and the Board has taken the necessary steps to recruit and retain one. The charity has had to remain competitive alongside our counterparts, such as the UN, Army and the Foreign Office.

'As a result, we introduced a school fees scheme for senior staff with over seven years’ service, and children from the age of 10 through to 18 are eligible and receive a percentage of their salary, which they put towards the part-payment of their children’s education - this is a taxable benefit.

'Guy’s remuneration package as fully disclosed reflects the complexity and responsibility of his role, pay in comparable jobs, entitlements of subordinate staff, the amount of time he is expected to spend abroad, and the value he provides in driving the efficiency and productivity of the charity to the benefit of mine-impacted communities.

'An ancillary benefit of the school fees scheme is that, as children come out of the education system, eligible senior staff’s salary will reduce accordingly and therefore it is a more efficient approach in the longer term for the organisation.'
