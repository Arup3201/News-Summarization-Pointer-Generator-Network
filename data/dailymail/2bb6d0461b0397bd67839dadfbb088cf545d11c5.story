Lionel Messi looked exhausted as the clock ticked into the 117th minute in Sao Paulo before he suddenly shifted up a gear to provide Angel Di Maria with a chance on a plate to win the game for Argentina.

The diminutive number 10 looked frustrated for long periods: left to win the game on his own, heavily marked and being constantly fouled - but when he finally got going he once again lit up the World Cup by setting up the winner with less than three minutes to go of extra time.

Argentina are still on track for a dream World Cup final with Brazil and it the end it all came down to Messi - again. Of his last 25 Argentina games he has won eighteen and drawn four. Brazil beware.

19 minutes: After a quiet opening the four-time Ballon d'Or winner brilliantly breaks past two Swiss defenders, but Ricardo Rodriguez recovers to nick the ball off him.

48 minutes: Granit Xhaka brings Messi down with a cynical trip on the right, which could have forced the referee into issuing the Swiss midfielder a second yellow card.

60 minutes: Fabian Schar is the latest player to foul Messi as he looks to link up Argentina's play in the middle. Switzerland seem to be becoming more desperate in their attempts to stop him.

67 minutes: Finding space on the edge of the area, Messi takes a bouncing ball on his chest before shooting left footed towards the top corner. It has the goalkeeper worried but just goes over the bar.

74 minutes: Working his way into the box on the left, Messi drifts in a cross but it is headed wide.

77 minutes: Messi finally gets a real effort in at goal. A corner breaks to him, he rounds two Swiss markers and then fires at goal through two pairs of legs but the 'keeper saves well.

80 minutes: Has the ball nicked from him on the edge of the box after a trademark run.

88 minutes: Messi runs past two but his pass is overhit and the recipient can't control it.

111 minutes: Messi labours on a pass and looks frustrated and exhausted after carrying Argentina this far.

117 minutes: A brilliant run carves through the Swiss defence before Messi slides the ball right to Di Maria win it.

He is now so key to Argentina's play 
that he was his side's top tackler - with six - alongside right back Pablo Zabaleta.

And Messi was, of course, constantly at the heart of everything Argentina did well offensively - although there wasn't much of that in a poor game in Sao Paulo.

Throughout the first half the Swiss were brilliant in their attempts to frustrate the little maestro, springing as many as four markers on him when needed as they nullified the threat of Argentina's talisman.

He briefly sparked into life midway through the half but the excellent Ricardo Rodriguez recovered to nick the ball from his toes.

It looked to be a frustrating afternoon for the man who had scored in all three of his games at this summer's tournament before facing Switzerland, with Argentina often forced to go wide and aim crosses into the box - obviously not Messi's strength.

But as the game ebbed on at 0-0, Messi began to have more and more influence, dropping deep to pick up the ball between the lines of Swiss defence and midfield.

In turn, his opponents changed their approach, with Granik Xhaka and Fabian Schar among the chief culprits repeatedly fouling the Argentine and preventing him from running at the defence.

But these are tactics Messi is used to, both at club level and particularly at this World Cup. Teams crowd him but he tends to find a way through.

Against Bosnia and Nigeria he scored relatively early - but in the 1-0 win over Iran his winner came in stoppage time - and it looked as though he would have to leave it late again.

With thirteen minutes to go he fired a warning shot: rounding two defenders and striking between two defenders' legs before the 'keeper saved.

As the game reached extra time, Argentina's talisman looked exhausted and again drifted out of the game - but his play for the goal was class, drifting past defenders with a trademark run before slipping the ball to Di Maria to win the game.
