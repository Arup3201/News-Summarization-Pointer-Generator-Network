A Syrian woman survived an execution by stoning in Syria and managed to flee because it was 'God's will that she lived'.

The woman was being stoned by the Islamic State group for alleged adultery and left for dead.

But the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said today that she has 'miraculously' walked away from the brutal punishment alive.

A Syrian woman has surviving an execution by stoning in Syria and managed to flee. Earlier this month, ISIS revealed pictures which show a woman (pictured) accused of adultery being brutally stoned to death 

The organisation said the jihadist group sentenced the woman to be 'stoned for adultery' in the town of Raqqa - an ISIS stronghold in northern Syria.

Militants carried out the punishment and 'stoned her until they thought she had died,' said the Britain-based monitor.

But just as they had stopped pelting her with stones, the woman stood up and tried to flee.

'An IS militant was about to open fire at her when an Islamist jurist intervened and stopped him saying it was God's will that she did not die,' said the Observatory, without specifying when it happened.

The jurist told the woman she can walk free but that she must 'repent'.

He reportedly told the gunman: 'Her sentence is done, let her go and repent to her God.' 

In the earlier execution, the burqa-clad woman read her charges for adultery by Abu Omar al-Ansari, an elderly Islamic State fighter, before she is stoned to death

According to the Observatory, at least 15 people, nine of them women, have been executed by jihadists in Syria, including Al-Qaeda-linked militants, since July for alleged adultery and homosexuality.

Earlier this month, the terrorist group revealed evidence of a series of horrific public executions.

They included two men who were hurled from the top of a tower block as a punishment for being gay, men who were crucified for banditry and a woman stoned to death for adultery.

The burqa clad woman was pictured being stoned to death by a horde of Islamic State militants, who hurled large rocks at her.

A piece of blue tarpaulin was then used to cover the dead woman’s body, which was seen on the ground surrounded by a pile of rocks.

ISIS and the Al-Nusra Front, Al-Qaeda's Syria branch, hold large swathes of Syria and have imposed a brutal version of Islamic law in territory under their control.
