A billion people around the world will turn their eyes to the Paralympic opening ceremony tonight, but there are four people who are paying extra attention to part two of London 2012.

Olympic heroes Jessica Ennis, Greg Rutherford, Louis Smith and Zoe Smith have issued a rousing message of support to their Paralympic counterparts in a video they hope will help add yet more gold medals to Britain's growing tally.

We Are Alongside You has been released in the build up to tonight's Paralympic opening ceremony.

The 41-second film opens with Heptathlete Jessica Ennis looking deep into the camera before saying: 'When you enter the stadium we will be beside you.'

Golden girl: The 41-second film opens with Heptathlete Jessica Ennis looking deep into the camera before saying: 'When you enter the stadium we will be beside you'

With her words interspersed by some of 
Britain's greatest highlights from the previous Paralympic Games in 
Beijing four years ago, she adds: 'When you take your marks we will be alongside you.

'When you cross the finish line we will be alongside you.'

She is followed by silver-medal winning gymnast Louis Smith saying: 'When there are tears in your eye.'

The gymnast and the weighlifter: Silver-medalist Louis Smith adds, 'When there are tears in your eye' while Zoe Smith continues, 'When you show how strong you can be'

Rousing: Long jump golden boy Greg Rutherford brings up the rear with the words, 'When you go further than you thought you ever would'

Then weight lifter Zoe Smith says: 'When you show how strong you can be.'

Long jump golden boy Greg Rutherford adds: 'When you go further than you thought you ever would.'

And the four athletes top the stirring tribute in unison with the words: 'Britain will be alongside you'.

Memories: The athletes' words of support are interspersed by some of Britain's greatest highlights from the previous Paralympic Games in Beijing four years ago

One to watch: Ellie Simmonds won gold in the 100m and 400m freestyle events in the S6 disability category.

Paralympic hero: Tom Aggar won gold in Beijing in the Men's Single Skulls

British Airways, who produced the film, said it was inspired by the definition of the word 'Paralympics' which 'many people are unaware of'.

A spokesman said: 'Its origin is from the Greek prefix 'Para' which translates as 'beside' 
or 'alongside', as the Paralympic Games  run in parallel to the Olympic 
Games.'

Tonight's opening ceremony is expected to be watched on TV by a record billion people around the world, as well as 80,000 in the stadium.

Adding definition: British Airways, who produced the film, said it was inspired by the definition of the word 'Paralympics' which 'many people are unaware of'

The ceremony, which is entitled 
Enlightenment, begins at 8.30pm and will kick-start 11 days of sport in 
front of unprecedented crowds – the event is on course to be the first 
sell-out Paralympic Games in history.

And Great Britain is hoping for a record 
haul of medals surpassing the 102 won in Beijing in 2008 as athletes are
inspired by their home crowds, as happened during the Olympics.
