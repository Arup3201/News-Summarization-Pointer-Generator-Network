The trial of the captain of the 
wrecked Costa Concordia cruise liner has begun in Tuscany, but was postponed immediately due to an eight-day nationwide lawyers' strike.

The sole defendant, Francesco 
Schettino, his eyes shaded by sunglasses, slipped in through a back door
and made no comment to reporters as he arrived on charges
of multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing the shipwreck 
near the tiny island of Giglio.

The trial in 
Grosseto is being held in a theatre 
converted into a courtroom to accommodate all the survivors and 
relatives of the 32 victims who want justice over the 2012 tragedy.

Facing the music: The captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia cruise ship, Francesco Schettino, arrives at courtÂ  in Tuscany for trial. Proceedings were postponed as a result of an Italian lawyers strike

Passengers and crew aboard the Concordia were left to their fate by Schettino. The trial in Grosseto is being held in a theatre converted into a courtroom to accommodate all the survivors and relatives of the 32 victims

Schettino's lawyer, Domenico Pepe, said some 1,000 witnesses are 
expected to eventually give evidence.

Many of them are expected to be 
from among the 4,200 passengers and crew on board the ship which struck a
jagged reef off Giglio, took on water and capsized.

Schettino, who has denied wrongdoing, could face up to 20 years in prison if he is convicted.

The wreck of the ship lies on its side
and half-submerged off Giglio, blighting the seascape for another 
summer in an otherwise pristine part of the Mediterranean, a daily 
reminder of the slow progress Italian authorities have made in handling 
the aftermath of the disaster.

The remains of two of the 32 dead have
yet to be found. The timetable to salvage it has stretched on. Only now
is anyone facing trial for the catastrophe - and even that process is 
expected to be immediately delayed.

Captain Francesco Schettino was at the command of the cruise liner in January 2012 when it hit rocks off the coast of Tuscany and sank, killing 32 people

A lifeboat is prepared after the ship run aground off Italian island 
Giglio's coast in January 2012. A report demolished Schettino's claim 
that he saved thousands of lives, by steering the ship into shore

Though court-appointed experts 
concluded that the crew and owner Costa Crociere SpA, a unit of 
Miami-based Carnival Corp, committed blunders and safety breaches which 
contributed to the tragedy off the island's rocky coast, only Captain 
Schettino has been ordered to stand trial.

Prosecutors contend that on the night 
of January 13 2012, he steered the ship too close to the island's 
coastline in a publicity stunt for Costa Crociere and accidentally 
rammed the jagged reef. The cruise company denies that scenario.

Survivors described a chaotic and 
delayed evacuation, with crew allegedly playing down the seriousness of 
the collision, which caused a 230ft (70m) gash in the Concordia's side 
and let seawater rush into the ship.

Schettino has protested his innocence,
insisting that his skilful steering of the liner to just outside the 
port saved thousands of lives. He also contends that the ship's 
navigational charts did not indicate that the reef was in its path as it
cruised near the island on part of a week-long Mediterranean tour.

A recording of a phone conversation 
between Schettino and an exasperated Italian coastguard official who 
repeatedly ordered the captain in vain to scramble back on board the 
ship to direct the evacuation was played again and again in broadcasts 
around the world.

In interviews, Schettino insisted he 
is no coward. He claimed he had to leave the capsizing liner before it 
was impossible to launch any more lifeboats and that in the darkness he 
did no see a ladder he could have used to climb back on board.

The captain has depicted himself as a 
scapegoat. Five other defendants - two ship officials, a helmsman, the 
hotel director aboard and the director of the cruise company's crisis 
unit - successfully sought pleas bargains. Yesterday, the lawyers' 
strike prompted the postponement of a hearing to announce their 
sentences, likely to be a fraction of what Schettino could get.

On Giglio, where residents depend on 
tourism and fishing for their livelihoods, the wreckage still mars the 
panorama from the island's port. Salvage experts had originally 
predicted the ship could be tipped upright in an ambitious operation so 
towing could begin in spring of this year. But that timetable has 
slipped away.

The removal project involves some 400 
workers representing 18 nationalities, including engineers and divers. 
Yesterday, crews were busy securing some of the caissons being attached 
to one side of the crippled ship, which, the planners hope, will help 
the wreckage stay afloat when eventually righted so it can be towed to 
the mainland.

Islanders are impatient for the removal of the eyesore.

'We want our island back as it was,' 
Giglio's mayor, Sergio Ortelli, told The Associated Press as he looked 
at the blue cove where he used to swim. Now, towering cranes and 
platforms of the removal team loom over the shipwreck.

Mr Ortelli said authorities told the islanders the operation to bring the wrecked ship upright again will begin in September .

The island is still awaiting 
compensation for damages caused by the shipwreck, he said - 'Our image 
was internationally damaged, and tourism figures have dropped off 
noticeably.'

Meanwhile, the remains of an Italian 
woman who was a passenger and of an Indian man who worked as a waiter 
have still not been recovered.

'The saddest thing is to pass by on 
the ferry and think that two bodies are still there, or will never be 
found,' said tourist Patrizia Giovanelli, who was making her second 
visit to the island.
