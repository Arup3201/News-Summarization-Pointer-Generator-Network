A South Dakota mother of five children has been arrested for her sixth drunken driving offense after driving on a sidewalk New Year's Eve with two children in her car.

Thirty-six-year-old Nichole Kroger faces several charges including drunken driving and child abuse.

She was spotted by an off-duty police officer in Sioux Falls around 6:10pm on Tuesday with an eight-year-old and a 10-year-old in her car. An on-duty officer eventually stopped and arrested her.

Sixth arrest: Nichole Kroger appeared in court and is being held on $10,000 bond

'That's the type of stuff that's out there all the time,' said police Lieutenant Jerome Miller to KDLT.

'Unfortunately that's the reason we are out there and appreciate those types of tips, whether they come from one of our own officers or another citizen - anything we can do to get those people off the road.'

Authorities say her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit for driving.

Her husband, Kevin Kroger, says his wife suffers from alcohol addiction and needs help, not incarceration.

He says she was sober for four years before the New Year's Eve incident.

'It had nothing to do with New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day,' Kevin Kroger said, adding that his wife is dealing with depression and addiction.

'She was a model mother,' he said. 'My kids are doing great right now, and she’s the reason why.'

Nichole Kroger was cited for the felony DUI, driving on the sidewalk and child endangerment, along with driving with a revoked license and no seat-belt and open container.

Her bond is set at $10,000.

Served time: Kroger has previously served two years in prison for driving under the influence

Nichole Kroger's last DUI was in 2009. She was sentenced to five years in prison and served two years before being paroled.

According to the Argus Leader, the Krogers are raising five children at home, including a nine-month-old baby with Down syndrome.

In 2012 she wrote on her Facebook page, 'Addiction is a disease. Relapse is the equivalent to a cancer patient no longer in remission. It hurts everyone involved. It will get you into trouble with the law if it doesnt kill you first. It makes you do ridiculous s***.'
