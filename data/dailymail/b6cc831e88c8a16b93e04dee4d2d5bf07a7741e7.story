The Director of Public Prosecutions yesterday defended the decision to charge Michael Le Vell with child abuse.

Keir Starmer QC told MPs that ‘the decision to proceed was the right decision’.

Appearing in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee, he said: ‘This was a properly brought prosecution according to the proper test.

'It would have been wrong not to have taken a case when there was a case to answer.’

Mr Le Vell, who has played Kevin Webster on Coronation Street for 30 years, was this week acquitted of abusing and raping a child over a period of nine years.

He said his life had been destroyed by ‘an absolute pack of lies’, and was reportedly so devastated that he considered suicide.

His relatives and colleagues condemned the Crown Prosecution Service, claiming the case should never have gone to court.

They accused CPS lawyers of leading a vindictive ‘witch-hunt’ against celebrities, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

However, Mr Starmer said yesterday: 
‘There is a safeguard within our system, and that is at the end of the 
prosecution case in court, it is not only open to the judge, it is the 
duty of the judge, to stop the case if there is no case to answer.

‘That did not happen in this case and therefore there was a case to answer. That case was answered and the jury took some time to consider their verdict – so it was a properly brought case.

'The idea that if a case results in an acquittal it shouldn’t have been brought is wrong.’

Damage: Keith Vaz MP said celebrities in particular suffer huge publicity

Keith Vaz MP, the committee’s chairman, said that celebrities in particular had to suffer huge publicity and ‘they feel their reputation has been damaged even after they have been acquitted’.

Mr Starmer countered that ‘in many cases the fact that a suspect or a person once charged is named leads other victims to come forward’.

He added: ‘We have a number of examples where having named somebody once charged, other victims have come forward, enabling a case to be built.’

Mr Le Vell’s former Coronation Street colleague Kevin Kennedy, who played Curly Watts, said yesterday: ‘There are no winners in this. It should never have got to this stage in the first place.’

Speaking on ITV’s This Morning, he added: ‘The anonymity should go across the board.’

Mr Le Vell’s accuser retains her anonymity despite his acquittal.

The Ministry of Justice has confirmed, however, that it has no plans to reform the law to allow those accused of sexual offences to retain their anonymity until convicted.

Nazir Afzal, the Crown Chief Prosecutor in the North-West, had initially decided not to charge Mr Le Vell in 2011 but was overruled by Alison Levitt QC, Mr Starmer’s principal adviser.

Mr Starmer said the original decision
 was reviewed and overturned after new evidence emerged, and Mr Afzal 
also denied there was a celebrity witch-hunt under way.

He said yesterday: ‘I absolutely detest this word “witch-hunt”. It is not a witch-hunt.

‘We look at the evidence. We follow the evidence. We present the evidence. I am not shy about pursuing these type of cases and will continue to do so.’

Mr Le Vell, 48, appeared bleary-eyed as he emerged from the front door of his terraced house yesterday morning, having celebrated his acquittal long into the night with his family at a top Manchester hotel.

Wearing a black dressing gown, he was photographed on the steps of his modest £230,000 Cheshire home, where he lives alone, at about 10am.

The actor is now set to  enter talks with bosses at ITV  to discuss his return to Coronation Street.
