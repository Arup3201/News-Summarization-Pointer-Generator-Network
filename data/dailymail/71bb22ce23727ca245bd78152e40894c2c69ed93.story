It might have taken eight years and £8,000 to build and have a flying time of just 18 seconds, but the designer of a pedal-powered aeroplane says he is delighted with his creation.

Formula one engineer David Barford, 42, who makes a living constructing racing car engines, built the unique man-powered plane in his own garage.

And when Betterfly took off from Sywell Aerodrome, Northamptonshire, in June, it became the first ever man-powered aircraft to take to the skies from the airport.

David, from East Hunsbury, Northamptonshire, said that making the aircraft has fulfilled a childhood dream: 'Ever since I was a child I would build things - it started with model aeroplanes but soon turned to wanting to create the real thing.

'At the age of seven, I would go to the library and read about human powered aircraft and that’s where the love came from.'

Betterfly has a wing-span of 20 metres and is purposely made to be as light as possible from special carbon.

It is powered solely by the pilot who pedals it like a bicycle.

David said: 'It was built on strength-to-weight radio so it is both resilient and flexible.

'I’ve made everything myself - and even bought a seven metre long oven so I could mould carbon around the shell.'

The device is larger than most man-powered planes as he wanted to be able to fit in it himself.

He said: 'Other planes that are man-powered have been built for someone who is extremely fit and slender to pedal.

'Unfortunately, I am not an Olympic athlete and wanted to be able to fly my own plane so I’ve made it slightly bigger and possible for me to power myself.'

David Barford says that although it may look dangerous, flying his aircraft is no more dangerous than cycling

David asked someone with experience in flying man-powered planes - Dr Bill Brooke - to take the controls for the first time so he could concentrate on where improvements needed to be made.

David said: 'I was overjoyed when I first saw it fly - it was almost a miracle to see it take off.

'When the wings took lift, you could hear the cheers of the crowds who had come to support us - it was a great feeling.'

David was delighted that flights in his plane last around 18 seconds at a speed of about 17mph.

He said: 'It flew like a dream. I was completely prepared for it to fail, but it went marvellously.

David Barford said it was 'almost a miracle' to see the aircraft, which he had spent £8,000 and eight years building, take off

'There’s a fine line between it breaking because it hasn’t been built properly or being too heavy so it wouldn’t take flight  - luckily we got it just right.

'It’s a very special feeling to sit there pedalling and then be lifted into the air - it totally fulfilled my dreams.

'You pedal really hard and then all of a sudden you are pedalling in mid-air, it’s very surreal and you feel like a puppet.'

During the week, Mr Barford works at the Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines factory in Brixworth, working on engines for Formula 1 drivers including Jenson Button and Michael Schumacher.

David added: 'People think it’s quite high-risk flying a man-powered plane but the risk is pretty low.

'If you were to fall, it would only be about as bad as a push-bike crash.'

Now Betterfly has completed its maiden flight at Sywell, it will take part in a national competition for human-powered flying machines.

The Royal Aeronautical Society’s Icarus Cup competition will be held in Hampshire from July 13th to the 23rd.

During the competition, Betterfly will compete against other man-powered planes in races, endurance tests and a slalom challenge.
