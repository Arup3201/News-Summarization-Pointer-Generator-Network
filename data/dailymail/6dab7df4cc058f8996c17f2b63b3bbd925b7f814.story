John Carver has defended Newcastle’s mid-season break in Dubai and warned his players they will be fined if curfews are broken.

The Magpies – who have a two-week break having been knocked out of the FA Cup - fly to the United Arab Emirates 24 hours after Saturday’s home game with Southampton and will return to the north-east on Thursday.

Caretaker boss Carver says the trip was planned regardless of whether they were playing in the FA Cup fourth round next weekend.

The Magpies have been forced to train indoors due to poor weather conditions in the north east 

It was three years ago that Alan Pardew and the club came in for heavy criticism when they were pictured partying in Tenerife before returning to lose at Brighton in the FA Cup.

But Carver says the warm-weather retreat will be beneficial to his squad.

‘This has been arranged from when Alan was manager,’ he explained.

‘For the last three or four years we've had a mid-season break. We've got a hurricane out there to deal with and it's difficult to do good quality stuff with the wind howling. We've had to work indoors because it's just unbearable.

‘So this is a chance to go away and get some proper work done.’

Carver, though, said the trip is not an excuse to party.

‘People will be putting two and two together and thinking it's a jolly, but let me tell you, it's no jolly-up,’ he said.

‘There will be curfews and I will treat the players with respect, but if anyone oversteps the mark or breaks the curfew then they will be fined. We'd still have gone away even if we'd had an FA Cup game this week. It's just like a normal week and will mirror our regular work here.

‘The players will be off Wednesday and most will probably play golf. We'll have a team meal on the night and there will be a couple of glasses of wine with that, then we're back on the bus and back to the hotel before coming home on Thursday.'
