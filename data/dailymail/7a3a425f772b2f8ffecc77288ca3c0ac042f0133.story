A journalist also known as a top player and spokesman for the hacking group Anonymous has been sentenced to just over five years in prison by a federal judge in Dallas on Thursday for charges including aiding in cyber crime.

Barrett Brown, arrested in 2012, was originally charged with collaborating with hackers but later pleaded guilty to lesser charges including accessory to the unauthorized access of a protected computer.

The judge sentenced Barret Brown to 63 months in prison, including the 31 months he has already served. He was also ordered to pay $890,000 in restitution.

Barret Brown, who said he was a top player in the hacking group Anonymous, was sentenced to just over five years in prison by a federal judge on Thursday for charges including aiding in cyber crime

Brown, 33, pleaded guilty in April to being an accessory after the fact for attempting to assist a hacker, hiding two computers from FBI agents who were executing a search warrant and threatening an FBI agent in a video.

The accessory after the fact charge relates to an incident in December 2011 when someone Brown knew as 'o' hacked the computer network of Austin, Texas-based private intelligence firm Stratfor and obtained confidential information, including credit card details, according to court papers.

Brown knew that the incident harmed Statfor's website and removed confidential data, according to court documents.

He also attempted to communicate with Stratfor's top official on behalf of the hacker to minimize damage, the papers said.

In a statement read in court on Thursday, Brown - who had written for Vanity Fair and other news outlets - said his role was to post a link which had already been made public.

He said the government 'exposed me to decades of prison time for copying and pasting a link to a publicly available file that other journalists were also linking to without being prosecuted.'

Brown claimed he was in a manic state brought on by sudden withdrawal from Paxil and Suboxone at the time he threatened an FBI agent via YouTube videos in 2012

Brown expressed regret for some of his actions, including threats made in online videos against an FBI agent.

'The videos were idiotic, and although I made them in a manic state brought on by sudden withdrawal from Paxil and Suboxone, and while distraught over the threats to prosecute my mother, that's still me in those YouTube clips talking nonsense about how the FBI would never take me alive,' he said.

Brown's defense was supported by media rights organizations including the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders, which claimed he was prosecuted for his actions as a journalist.

Brown and his supporters had asked him to be sentenced to time already served, or 30 months.

In a statement after the sentencing, Brown appeared defiant as he mocked the process.

'Good news! -- The US government decided today that because I did such a good job investigating the cyber-industrial complex, they're now going to send me to investigate the prison-industrial complex,' he said.

'For the next 35 months, I'll be provided with free food, clothes, and housing as I seek to expose wrongdoing by Bureau of Prisons officials and staff and otherwise report on news and culture in the world's greatest prison system.'
