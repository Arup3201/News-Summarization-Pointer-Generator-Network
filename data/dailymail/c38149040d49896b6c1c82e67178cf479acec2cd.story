AC Milan returned to winning ways after picking up just two points in their last three games with Sulley Muntari and Keisuke Honda on target in a 2-0 win over Chievo Verona.

Muntari marked his 250th Serie A appearance with his 26th goal early in the second half with Honda adding a second with just over 10 minutes remaining.

The win lifted the Rossoneri up into a share of fifth with Sampdoria and Hellas Verona, ahead of the rest of the weekend's games on Sunday.

Hellas Verona left it late to beat Cagliari 1-0 at the Stadio Bentegodi, with Panagiotis Tachtsidis' goal securing victory in the 89th minute.

Verona could have been celebrating a more comfortable win, having seen a valid goal ruled out in the first half and two shots come back out after hitting the crossbar in the second 45 minutes.

Cagliari also contributed to an entertaining game with chances of their own, but, after putting four past Inter Milan last weekend, they were unable to find one and they paid the price with the Greek's late winner.
