A strange animal captured by a Texas couple and believed to be the legendary 'goat sucker' beast el chupacabra has been put to sleep.

Jackie Stock and her husband Bubba discovered the hairless, growling creature eating corn outside their Ratcliffe home on Sunday but have since had it euthanized because it appeared to be suffering.

'It went to sleep peacefully,' she told TMZ. 'I had gotten attached.  I was calling him Chupie.  He will be missed.'

Is this El Chupacabra? A Texas couple found this mysterious creature in their yard on Sunday and believe it is a legendary chupacabra

'He called me to come and look, and I said "Bubba that looks like a baby chupacabra,¿' said Jackie Stock after her husband first happened on the creature

Officials at the DeWitt County Sheriff's Office referred inquiries about the animal to local game warden Mike Hoffman, who has yet to respond to interview requests from MailOnline.

The woman also told the gossip site that she had received several complaints over the bizarre animal being kept in a cage and not receiving proper care.

The couple was in disbelief after first discovering the creature, which she said is likely only a raccoon with mange.

'He called me to come and look, and I said 'Bubba that looks like a baby chupacabra,' Stock said.

The animal was not very large--perhaps the size of a house cat.

But its wrinkly black skin and bulbous eyes still lent it a look of menace.

The couple kept it in a cage, fed it and made sure it had water.

They also gave friends and neighbors the opportunity to come take a peek.

Neighbor Arlen Parma spoke from experience, and insisted it was likely the blood-sucking chupacabra.

'I hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and I ain’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there,' Parma told KAVU.

'We've never seen anything like it before': The couple has kept the animal around in order to show it around in hopes someone can ID it

'I hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and I ain’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there,' said the Stocks' neighbor Arlen Parma

And his identification wasn't just based on looks:

'A coon doesn’t make that noise, or a possum. What makes that noise? I guess a chupacabra does,' Parma said.

Stock and her husband say they kept the animal in a cage, not to harm it, but out of curiosity.

'We were just trying to figure out what it is because we've never seen anything like it before,' Stock said.

No chupacabra has ever been positively identified, of course, and if the Stock's find is ever ID'd, it will likely be as a mammal, possibly with a parasitic infestation that has caused its hair to fall out.

Mangy? Many believe chupacabra sightings are nothing more than mammals like foxes or raccoons with hair loss caused by mange

 LEGEND OF EL CHUPACABRA

The word comes from two Spanish words - 'chupar', to suck, and 'cabra', goat.

The first reported sighting was In 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood.

Thus, the legend of the livestock killing, vampire-like chupacabra was born.

Since then, the legendary beast has been spotted across the Americas and even the world.

A Mexican incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on El Chupacabra in 2012.

Earlier this year, yet another Mississippi sighting came when a Leake County man actually shot and killed what he claimed was El Chupacabra.

Even a Belarusian town had a Chupacabra sighting this past July

SCIENCE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN

Scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be El Chupacabra are actually wildlife like coyotes, foxes, and stray dogs infested with parasites.

Most commonly pointed to is the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes mange.

Mange is a painful, potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel, making for an even more ghoulish looking beast.

In humans, Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies and a consequent itchy, painful rash as the parasites burrow around, leaving their feces under the skin.

'Goat
 sucker': The legend of El Chupacabra likely originates from a 1995 case
 in Puerto Rico where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds. It 
has been described as hairless, or as having spines along its back, and 
as having blue or red eyes
