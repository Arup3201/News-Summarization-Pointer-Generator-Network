Comic book tycoon and Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal has promised to send a letter of apology to Leicester following Sunday night’s ugly scenes at Welford Road.

The French giants are also considering an internal suspension for Italian prop Martin Castrogiovanni, whose expletive-laden outburst at Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill overshadowed a famous 25-21 victory for the East Midlands club.

But Toulon have refused to comment on yesterday’s allegations in Sportsmail that former England full back Delon Armitage threatened to ‘take the face off’ a supporter after the final whistle.

Speaking to French media about Castrogiovanni’s foul-mouthed rant, Boudjellal said: ‘I am very surprised. This is not the boy I know; I think he spoke under the influence of disappointment. We will send Leicester and their manager Richard Cockerill a letter of apology. Along with Bernard Laporte, we will call the player and decide whether we do something or not — a sanction is not excluded.’

Castrogiovanni’s comments were in response to claims from Cockerill that he joined Toulon for a pay-rise. The 33-year-old — whose agent, Sportsmail understands, was in Asia last week to discuss a summer move to Japan — has been backed by his Toulon team-mates.

All Blacks lock Ali Williams said on Twitter: ‘Finally a man that speaks his heart and truth of what happens between management and players. So much that is untold.’

Former Australia playmaker Matt Giteau tweeted: ‘Don’t condone the swearing but good on u @castrito81 standing up for urself & the team!!’

There has been no such support for Armitage, who is at risk of missing out on Saturday’s return leg at the Stade Felix Mayol. A victory would keep Toulon top of Pool 3.

With three wins from three, Harlequins are leading the English challenge to dethrone the Top 14 side, who are hoping to win their third successive European crown.

Conor O’Shea’s side travel to Leinster on Saturday, but they are likely to be without England captain Chris Robshaw and fly-half Nick Evans for the fixture in Dublin. ‘Chris is doubtful and I wouldn’t say Nick will make it either,’ said O’Shea. ‘We know there’s going to be a huge backlash from them, but we’re not going to sit back. We’ll take the game to them. It will be a war and a physical battle.

‘To me, Leinster are better than Toulon. Toulon’s coaches have done a brilliant job and they’ve got an incredible record, but playing fantasy rugby versus building something is completely different. Leinster have built an incredible brand since the days I used to play for them in front of 300 people.’

The absence of Robshaw will increase the pressure on rookie captain Joe Marler who, according to O’Shea, put in one of the best performances of his career during last weekend’s 24-18 victory in the first of two fixtures against Leinster.

‘I thought he came of age in every way he could on Sunday,’ said O’Shea. ‘In the way he controlled the team, his individual performance and his decision-making. When I made Chris captain, I said “you are captain to be you, not to be someone else.” The minute you are comfortable with that you can become very good at what you do, as opposed to thinking I have to be like Martin Johnson or Brian O’Driscoll. He will grow and he will get better for that.’
