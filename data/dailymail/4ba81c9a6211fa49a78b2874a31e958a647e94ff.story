The instinctive reading of the ball as it came back across the penalty area would be the envy of many a top striker

As would the presence of mind to get in front of the covering defender. So too the smart outside-of-the-boot finish into the one area the goalkeeper couldn't stop it.

Blink and you could imagine it was Robbie Keane out there earning the Republic of Ireland a point in Germany or another goal-greedy striker of his ilk.

Yet it was John O'Shea out there grounding out a draw for Ireland in their quest to reach Euro 2016. That's John O'Shea. The defender.

For so long unsung and under-appreciated, it's time, on the occasion of O'Shea's 100th international cap, to raise our glasses to a man who throughout his career has been a byword for presence and professionalism.

O'Shea is not, nor has ever been, a glamorous player. There have been good times and there have been bad times. But his contribution, whether for Manchester United, Sunderland or Ireland, has been marvellous.

It's quite easy to forget that O'Shea made 393 appearances for United over the course of his 12 years in the Old Trafford first-team squad.

And it may surprise the uninitiated that he has five Premier Leagues, an FA Cup, three League Cups and the Champions League in his trophy cabinet.

Add to that the 121 games he has played for Sunderland, many as captain, and that century of caps for his country.

Nobody clocks up that amount of games by fluke. That's why it was so wonderful, on his big history-making night, to see O'Shea there, in the 94th minute when all hope seemed lost, rescuing a precious point and avoiding an accident on the long road to France.

His beaming smile radiated out from many back pages on Wednesday morning, his Irish eyes also smiling as they gazed up at the delirious travelling support high in one corner of the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen.

This was John Francis O'Shea from Waterford, sticking it to the world champions.

One of United's own, a product of that prestigious academy, O'Shea slowly but assuredly worked his way up into the first team.

Admired by Sir Alex Ferguson for his versatility, O'Shea made his breakthrough as a 21-year-old because he could play at left-back, right-back, centre-back or in central midfield.

Roy Keane jumps on O'Shea to congratulate him on his goal against Arsenal but would criticise his team-mate during their time together at Old Trafford 

It didn't matter where he was asked to play, you could depend on O'Shea to produce a performance of efficiency and character.

He'll always be remembered at Old Trafford for that outrageous lob over Manuel Almunia from outside the box in United's 4-2 win at Arsenal in the 2004-2005 campaign.

And equally he'll be remembered as one of those criticised by Roy Keane's acerbic tongue the following season.

Unlike many of those blasted in that never-aired MUTV interview, O'Shea survived - and prospered, winning trophies at home and abroad.

He scored a critical last-minute winner at Anfield as United won the title in 2006-2007 and was used as an emergency striker at times the following campaign, which he ended as a European champion.

O'Shea scored against Arsenal in the Champions League semi-final, first leg in 2009, setting United on course for a 4-1 aggregate win and Ferguson put him in the team for the final with Barcelona as a reward.

You see, critical goals in critical games are not a recent phenomenon for this man.

Perhaps the highlight was still to come - O'Shea was handed the captain's armband for the Champions League semi-final with Schalke in 2011. It proved a fitting farewell.

Many believe there isn't life after United but O'Shea has proved an exception, a little like Phil Neville at Everton.

Joining Sunderland has meant flirtations with relegation and a few thrashings, but allowed him to develop his leadership skills.

He has always been a positive presence both on the field and behind-the-scenes at the Stadium of Light, a future manager-in-the-making you would imagine.

O'Shea is 33 now and will eventually decide to call it a day. He'll bring the same level of dedication to whatever he chooses to do next.

He'll never be the most celebrated of players but that just makes those headline-grabbing moments like the one in Germany all the more magical.
