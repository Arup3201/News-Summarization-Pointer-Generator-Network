Forget the nuclear apocalypse - is the beer still good?

That was the question on the minds of scientists in the late 1950s - looking to see if items like beer and soft drinks were still drinkable if an atomic bomb went off nearby.

The experiment was conducted as a part of Operation Teapot, a sequence of nuclear weapons assessments by the U.S. Military in 1955.

Documentation of the 1957 experiment has now been made available by science historian Alex Wellerstein, who runs the blog Restricted Data.

The cans and bottles were set up in three positions ranging from 0.2 miles to one mile away from ‘ground zero’ of the atomic blast.

The study found that the drinks were mostly unaffected by the radiation - except for the few bottles that were shattered by the force of the bomb blast.

There was however, a question of a taste in the beer.

The document read: 'Some flavor change was found in the beverages, more in beer than in soft drinks.'

Drinks placed more than 1,270 feet away from ground zero showed no change to their consistency or taste.

They also retained their airtight carbonation.

The study ruled that the containers housing soft drinks and beer would be OK for consumption in the event of a nuclear explosion.

Results: Drinks placed more than 1,270 feet away from ground zero showed no change to their consistency or taste
