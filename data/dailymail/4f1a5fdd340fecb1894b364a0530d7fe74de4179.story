Tottenham can finally press on with plans to build a £400 million stadium after a High Court judge ruled they can force out the one business blocking their way.

Archway Sheet Metal Works were fighting a compulsory purchase order making them give up their land for Spurs to build a new 56,000-seat ground next to White Hart Lane.

The company has 21 days to appeal but Mr Justice Dove told them they have no reasonable chance of success.

Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham needed for their stadium development argued that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful

How Tottenham's new stadium will look for night games from 2018-19 season onwards

It is anticipated that once work starts on the new stadium it will take three years to complete.

The news will give Tottenham supporters an extra lift before tomorrow's London derby against West Ham.

Sam Allardyce, the West Ham manager, has stoked the flames by claiming he could have succeeded where Spurs have failed this season by getting Emmanuel Adebayor (right) scoring again.

Allardyce tried to end Adebayor's nightmare at White Hart Lane by taking him to Upton Park on loan last month.

The misfiring Tottenham striker has scored just two goals in 15 games so far this season

The striker was close to a deadline day move only for Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy to veto the deal. Since then, Adebayor has not made even one of manager Mauricio Pochettino's match squads.

In 12 Spurs games this year Adebayor has started just once and been on the bench three times — playing just 115 minutes.

Allardyce, who has lost striker Andy Carroll for the rest of the campaign with a knee injury, instead brought in 33-year-old Brazilian Nene on a free transfer.

Now Big Sam is convinced he could have got the best of Adebayor.

Allardyce said: 'He is one of those players that you have to look at and say, 'How do I react to him and interact with him (because) that is the basis for how well he plays for us?'

'You use your management skills in terms of looking at his personality and talking about wanting him to enjoy his football and do what he does best: play and score goals.'
