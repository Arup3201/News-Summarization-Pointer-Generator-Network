A bride-to-be was 'disfigured' at her engagement party when a woman who had once appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show deliberately smashed a glass into her face, a jury was told today.

It should have been one of the happiest days in Lucy Steers’ life - but Jennifer Eckley’s attack on her made it one of the worst, said prosecutor Julian Kesner at Gloucester Crown Court.

Miss Steers, of Gloucetershire, suffered a broken nose, a ‘gaping’ 2cm wound on the bridge of her nose and two other cuts - one to the side of the nose and one to the eye, he said.

It was suggested during the trial that Eckley's past appearance on the Jeremy Kyle show was the trigger which led to the alleged attack.

The defence suggested that Miss Steers had been 'taunting' Eckley about her appearance on the controversial show and the violence then broke out.

Details of why Eckley appeared on Jeremy Kyle were not given to the jury.

Just before she glassed Ms Steers, the 
defendant told her: 'I suppose you think you’re f****** pretty - well you
won’t be now,' it was alleged.

Child-minder Eckley, 27, of Newent, Gloucestershire, denies wounding Miss Steers with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm on the night of 1/2 December last year at the George Hotel in Newent.

She also denies assaulting another woman guest, Kate Taylor, by beating.

The jury was told that she has, however, admitted a less serious assault on Miss Steers and a charge of assault on Kate Taylor’s sister, Nicola Taylor.

Mr Kesner told the jury that the assaults on the Taylor sisters happened between about 10.30-10.45pm that night. They were sparked, he said, by Nicola Taylor bad-mouthing Eckley’s boyfriend Mark Beacham.

Nicola Taylor had gone out with Mr Beacham before Eckley became his girlfriend, Mr Kesner said.

Surprisingly, in view of the attacks on the sisters, Eckley was still at the pub an hour later when she glassed Miss Steers, he added.

'She left the most serious assault until last,' he said.

'Glass in hand she hit and disfigured Lucy Steers.'

'Rather than being one of the happiest days of Lucy Steers’ life, her engagement party, it turned out to be one of the worst.'

Lucy had thrown the party at the George with her fiance Craig Mortimer because her father was a manager at the hotel, he said.

Mr Kesner told the jury the first assault happened when Nicola Taylor was in an alleyway and Eckley approached her and said she was fed up with what she was saying about her bloke.

'She grabbed Nicola Taylor’s hair and banged her head against a wall. Two people intervened to stop her. One of those who intervened was Nicola’s sister Kate.

'During that intervention and the general melee the defendant punched Kate in the face.'

Mr Kesner said Eckley was pulled away. An hour later she approached Miss Steers in the bar and was ‘having a go at her’ when pub landlord Rhodri Yendle pulled her away.

He was talking to her in the alleyway and telling her to calm down when she saw Miss Steers in a back smoking area .

'Understandably Miss Steers was upset about the earlier incident and was saying something about the defendant which Ms Eckley overheard.'

'On hearing her the defendant responded by going to the smoking area. It is an undisputed fact in this case that she went there to have another go at Lucy.

'The prosecution say she was on the warpath and it was obvious to everyone in the smoking area that she was after Lucy.'

Eckley was arrested about an hour after the glassing and made no comment - except to say to a police officer: 'No-one is going to want me to look after their kids now that I have glassed someone in the face.'

Yet in her defence statement Eckley has denied saying that to the officer - and denied that she had a glass in her hand. She also disputed that Lucy’s injuries were caused by a glass, said Mr Kesner.

It was suggested during the trial that Eckley's past appearance on the Jeremy Kyle show (pictured) was the trigger which led to the alleged attack

Cross-examining her, defence lawyer Jason Coulter asked her about CCTV footage of her and Eckley talking in the hotel bar.

'I suggest it was a reasonably friendly chat but it got a bit difficult after that because you made reference to her appearing some time earlier on the Jeremy Kyle TV show?' asked Mr Coulter

'She appeared live on the show discussing a subject which is not desperately important to this case but no doubt it caused some local interest in Newent to all who knew her. Did you watch the show?'

Ms Steers said she did.

'It was when you mentioned that that things became heated between you I suggest?' said Mr Coulter.

'Do you remember?'

Ms Steers said 'No.'

The trial continues.
