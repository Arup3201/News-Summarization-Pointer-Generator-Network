A Libyan architect who had half his face blown off in a rocket attack is talking again after a series of life-saving operations.

Mohamed Z underwent crucial surgery five times at the Martin-Luther Hospital in Berlin, Germany, to reconstruct his lips, parts of his nose and his jaw.

The 29-year-old was travelling in a car in Misrata in June when the fallout from a missile ripped through the vehicle and tore a gaping hole in his face.

Confident: Mohamed Z underwent several bouts of life-saving surgery to reconstruct his lips, nose and jaw

Speaking yesterday for the first time since the horrific incident, he said: 'I'm happy, I can laugh and eat.'

Following the blast his uncle took him to Egypt, where doctors fed him through a tube into his stomach.

Otherwise he would have starved to death.

Relief organisation Doctors for Germany in Libya then brought him to Europe, where plastic surgeon Dr Johannes Bruck convinced his bosses at Martin Luther Hospital in Berlin to foot the bill.

Their first challenge was to reconstruct his jaw and nose.

To do this, they took a palm-sized piece of skin from his groin, which they put on his face.

Dr Bruck said: 'The skin there is very
thin, making it possible to produce a better facial expressions.'

Then,
with skin from his arm, his mouth was restored. Mohamed, who needed translators to keep him up to date with what was going on, underwent almost daily surgery.

Having
arrived in a deep state of depression, and unable to look at himself in
the mirror, Bruck revealed his patient was now getting to grips with 
his new look.

He said: 'He has accepted his face.'

Mohamed,
who has six sisters and two brothers and lives with other Libyans in 
Charlotteburg, will have to wait another three months before he can 
return home to Libya.

Dr 
Bruck, chief physician at the Clinic for Aesthetic Surgery at the 
hospital, added: 'First his mouth must be stable, so that he can get a 
prosthesis.'
