The funeral was held Sunday for Mexican wrestler Pedro Aguayo Ramirez, known as Hijo del Perro Aguayo, who died from injuries sustained during a match in Tijuana.

Aguayo, 35, was the son of the legendary Pedro 'Perro' Aguayo, now retired and a member of the Aztec lucha hall of fame.

The father didn't speak to reporters at the funeral in Guadalajara in central Mexico, but Aguayo's mother released a statement which came amid a debate over how the wrestler died and whether he received adequate medical attention following his injury.

'We, as relatives of Pedro, want to thank all of you for the affection and respect you have shown for Pedro, and you will understand that we are in no condition to comment with respect to the death of Pedro,' Luz Ramirez said.

Aguayo fell unconscious on the ropes, apparently after receiving a flying kick from fellow wrestler Oscar Gutierrez, known as Rey Mysterio Jr., according to video of the match. 

The Tijuana Boxing and Wrestling Commission called the death an unfortunate accident. Commission President Juan Carlos Pelayo said the doctor in charge was not at ringside because he was treating another injured wrestler, but paramedics and a doctor who was a spectator attended to Aguayo.

'The reaction for medical attention was quick, in my opinion,' Pelayo said Saturday.

On Sunday, Gutierrez said that no arrest order had been issued for the other wrestler, though he did not discount that he would be called in for questioning. 

The team match continued for almost two minutes before the other participants and the referee realized Aguayo was seriously injured and tended to him, according to video shot in a municipal auditorium in Tijuana, Mexico.

Mexico is famous for its colorful characters and costumes in professional wrestling, popularly known as lucha libre. 

The elder Aguayo was a lucha libre sensation from the 1970s to 1990s.

The younger Aguayo began wrestling in his teens and also was very popular, leading a group called 'Los Perros de Mal,' or the bad dogs.

Bleacher Report writes that Friday's match was supposed to be a celebration and it was Mysterio's first time fighting for the AAA since 1997 after leaving the WWE. 

Wrestler Hijo del Santo said: 'It makes me very sad because he was a professional colleague and I have great affection for his father.

'I think the fans in Japan, the US and Mexico, of course, where he was very popular, must be in mourning, especially because of his youth. 

'He had much ahead of him.'
