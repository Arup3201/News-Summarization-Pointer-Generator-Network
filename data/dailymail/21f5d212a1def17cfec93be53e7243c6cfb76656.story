He has been released from hospital and remains in Israel. But had watched four of his fellow soldiers killed in front of him, according to PennLive.

The soldier is the son of Laurel Frankston Lagstein and Roger Grass.

Dozens of young Jews from around the world have volunteered to fight for the Israeli Defense Forces in the current conflict in Gaza, marching in the desert and taking up arms to defend the Jewish state.

There are about 2,000 'lone soldiers' as they are called currently serving in the military, said Marina Rozhansky, spokeswoman at the Israel Consul General in Los Angeles.

For Jews who left Israel before the age of 15 or who never lived there, their service is voluntary.

For many, it is a calling, a way to get back to their roots and unite the world's Jewish population. Some have dual citizenship.

Rite Aid founder Alex Grass was born in Scranton 
Pennsylvania in 1927 and launched the company in 1968.

In later life, he 
used his vast wealth for philanthropic causes and for many years, headed the board of 
governors of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Mr Grass passed away in 2009 after a long battle with lung cancer.

He is survived by three children, Martin Grass of Florida, Roger Grass of Israel and Elizabeth Weese of Baltimore. His daughter Linda Shapiro Chemtob, of New York, passed away in 2011.
