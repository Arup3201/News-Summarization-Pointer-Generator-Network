Sutherland's spokesperson responded by saying: 'Kiefer enjoyed working with Freddie and wishes him the best'

A Fox spokesperson insists 24 star is 'beloved by cast and crew' and branded Prinze Jr's comments 'so out of left field'

Not happy: Freddie Prinze Jr spoke out at Comic Con about his 24 co-star Kiefer Sutherland

He appeared in every episode of the eighth season of Kiefer Sutherland hit TV series 24.

But it seems the experience was enough to turn Freddie Prinze Jr off acting for good.

'I did 24, it was terrible. I hated 
every moment of it,' he told ABC News this weekend. 'I just wanted to quit the 
business after that. So, I just sort of stopped.'

The 38-year-old star said he had found working with Kiefer particularly difficult.

'Kiefer was the most unprofessional dude 
in the world,' said Freddie. 'That's not me talking trash, I'd say 
it to his face. I think everyone that's worked with him has said that.'

Speaking at Comic Con in San Diego, where he was promoting his new Disney XD series Star Wars Rebels, the actor went on to further poke jibes at Kiefer.

'I went and worked for [CEO and promoter] Vince McMahon at the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), for Christ's 
sake.

'But, at least he was cool and tall. I didn't have to take my 
shoes off to do scenes with him, which they made me do [at 24].

'Just put
 the guy on an apple box or don't hire me next time. You know I'm 6 feet
 and he's 5ft 4ins.

Incidentally, recorded heights for Sutherland range from 5ft 8ins to 5ft 9ins tall.

Following 24, where he played Cole Ortiz, Director of Field Operations for CTU New York, Freddie worked at WWE in the role of producer and director, before appearing in Witches Of East End and Bones.

Freddie is voicing leader Kanan Jarrus in Star Wars Rebels - an animated TV series to air in October and which will tell the story of the origins of the Rebel Alliance as detailed in 1977 movie Star Wars: A New Hope.

Keifer's 
spokesperson responded to the comments on Monday, telling TMZ: 'Kiefer 
worked with Freddie Prinze, Jr. more than 5 years ago, and this is the 
first he has heard of Freddie's grievances.

'Kiefer enjoyed working with Freddie and wishes him the best.'

A
 spokesperson for Fox insisted Kiefter was 'nothing but professional 
during the run of the show and is beloved by cast and crew. It's so out 
of left field, 5 years later.'

'We wouldn't have done another '24' if Kiefer were anything like Freddie described.'
