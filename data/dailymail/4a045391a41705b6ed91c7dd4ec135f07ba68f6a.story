A Colorado man who was found living illegally in the rafters of a Denver restaurant after he tumbled through the ceiling and caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage was sentenced yesterday.

Stephen Graves, 36, was discovered living above the Yard House restaurant in Denver on December 10 when he fell through the ceiling and broke a sprinkler head. 

He pleaded guilty to first-degree criminal trespass, a felony, and was sentenced to two years mental health probation.

Graves was originally charged with burglary and two counts of criminal mischief, the Denver Post reported. 

The probation sentence will run concurrent with two other cases, according to the Denver District Attorney's office. 

When Graves fell through the ceiling and broke the sprinkler, it caused the restaurant and the Sheraton Hotel next door to flood. 

It is believed Graves, who was only wearing jeans at the time, fell about 20 feet.

He became trapped in a wall in the restaurant and had to be cut out with a chainsaw, 7NEWS reported. 

James Ballinger with the Denver Police Department said: 'There was moaning coming from one of the walls to the right of the front doors.'

A search of the area Graves was occupying revealed numerous bottle caps from alcoholic beverages.

It is unclear how long he was living in the restaurant before his ill-fated fall.
