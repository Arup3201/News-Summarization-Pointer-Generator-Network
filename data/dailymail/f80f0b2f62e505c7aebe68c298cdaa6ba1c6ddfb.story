A California chef abruptly quit his job Saturday after he says his cold-hearted bosses ordered an employee to drown a baby possum in bleach.

Dany Pena was head chef at South beach Pizza Company in Santa Cruz until he arrived to work to find two workers hovering over the young marsupial, which they'd trapped in a trash can.

'I immediately freaked out,' the 35-year-old told KGO-TV. 'It was a baby, and the sweetest looking guy on the planet.'

According to Pena, the employees had been ordered to kill the critter by pouring caustic cleaner over it.

Pena says he tried washing off the possum and rushed it to an animal rescue center, where it soon died.

He quit his job before he drove away.

'The lack of remorse they had about this act of cruelty led me to quit. None of God's creatures should be treated in this manner,' Pena said. 

Joining Pena in his outrage are county animal control officials.

Rebecca Dmytryk of Wildlife Emergency Service told CBS San Francisco her agency is now investigating the animal cruelty claim.
