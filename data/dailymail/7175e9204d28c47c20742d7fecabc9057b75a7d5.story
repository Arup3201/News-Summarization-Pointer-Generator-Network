A fish and chip shop in South Australia has been threatened with a $20,000 fine, simply for having a sign in its window letting people know they are open for business.

Feathers Fish And Chip Shop in Hazelwood Park - located about 15 minutes from Adelaide's city centre - was issued with a number of warnings for the sign which has been in the front window for 13 years.

Owner Peter Alevizos said he is 'flabbergasted' at why his small business has been targeted over the light-up 'open' sign, when 'all we’re doing is advertising that we’re open.'

The 'open' sign lights are not allowed and if turned on again could cost owner Peter Alevizos a lot of money

'There’s a lot of things around that can distract people; there are roadwork signs that flash brighter than that', he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Alevizos first received notice of the council's issue with the sign last October, when a letter arrived in the mail threatening him with a hefty fine should he continue to turn the sign on.

Owner Peter Alevizos said he doesn't see how he's doing anything wrong by letting people know he's open

'After that I spoke to the council and I said to them look I received your letter I’m flabbergasted to why we've been issued this,' he said.

‘You can’t tell me that in 13 years, 365 days in a year (and) I've never received a letter about it until now,' he continued.

The second blow came when he shop owner was in hospital with family the day his mother passed away. A staff member was running the shop that day and accidentally  lit the sign up.

A council member saw it on, snapped a photo of it and soon after Mr Alevizos was issued with a $750 fine.

However that fine was later waived, but the issue continued to 'snowball from there'.

Independent South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon had also expressed his outrage at the 'bureaucratic madness'.

He was due to hold a press conference on the issue, but the people he had hired to provide signs for the event got spooked and pulled out amid fears they would also be targeted by the council.

'This is a case of red tape madness,' Senator Xenophon told Daily Mail Australia.

'This is mindless, petty red tape that is actually killing jobs and making it very hard for small businesses to survive.

Independent South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon described the ordeal as a targeted attack on small businesses 

'Why do councils do this? ‘Because they can,' he added.

Mr Xenophon urged others to come forward with similar cases, saying that such instances are 'taking our country's economy backwards.'

'Local governments deserve to be a laughing stock for trying to enforce these sorts of regulations,' he said, before adding that the whole situation is 'absurd'. 

Potentially facing a $20,000 fine should the Open sign be switched on again, Mr Alevizos described the ordeal as 'revenue raising' and said he had been unfairly targeted as a small business owner.

'All I'm doing is letting people know I'm open', he said.

'It’s not an eyesore, you really have to look for it to see it.

'I just think that it’s not fair.

'Surely in this day and age we have better things to worry about than little signs,' Mr Alevizos added.
