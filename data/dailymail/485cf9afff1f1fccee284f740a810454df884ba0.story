Postmistress: Margaret Player, 46, pretended she had been robbed at gunpoint, sparking a 600 hour police hunt, to cover up almost £4,000 of till thefts

A village postmistress who pretended she had been robbed at gunpoint to cover up nearly £4,000 of till thefts has been jailed.

After stealing money from the post office branch in Croxton Kerrial, Leicestershire, Margaret Player rang 999 and falsely claimed a masked raider with a handgun had taken the cash sparking a 600 hour police hunt.

Officers from Leicester Police spent between 500 and 600 hours searching for the non-existant thief, at a cost of almost £14,000 as 19 constables, a tactical firearms team, three sergeants, various inspectors and forensics experts joined the hunt.

Police eventually came to suspect that Player had faked the robbery and asked for an audit of the post office’s accounts, revealing the truth behind the missing money.

Player, 46, from Croxton Kerrial, admitted fraudulently falsifying accounting records, to conceal the fact that £3,800 was missing, between August 2011 and January 2012.

She pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by falsely claiming that she had been robbed on December 20, 2011, and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.

Neil Bannister, prosecuting, told Leicester Crown Court that inquiries revealed how Player had asked the Post Office for an additional delivery of £1,000 of funds prior to the false robbery claim, but the request was refused.

She had also told a pensioner on the day of the fake robbery she did not have enough cash to cover pension payments.

'The police couldn’t find any evidence a robbery took place, and her explanation of what happened did not appear credible,' said Mr Bannister.

House to house inquiries were made, and people who were at a bus stop opposite the Post Office at the time of the supposed raid told officers they had not seen anything suspicious.

A Post Office audit ascertained £3,196 was missing following the ‘robbery’ but Player went on to steal a further £658 from the till after it was restocked.

At one stage, Player had even pointed the finger of suspicion at the previous post mistress who still lived on the premises - resulting in an innocent woman being arrested and interviewed.

Jonathan Dunne, mitigating, said Player had no previous convictions and was in debt at the time.

'She found it all too easy by using the post office till as a way of making ends meet, using it for extra money to tide her over,' he said.

'Having told the initial lie, it’s taken until now to admit to her lawyers what she’d done. She lost her job because of her dishonesty and is in even more reduced circumstances than in 2011.'

Mr Dunne said Player suffered from ill health and was facing eviction from her home.

'You succumbed to the temptation of putting your hand in the till when you were a post mistress'

Judge Nicholas Dean QC

Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Dean QC told Player: 'You persisted until June this year, insisting there was a robbery.

'You’ve finally faced up to the truth.'

The judge added: 'You had pleaded guilty at an earlier stage to misappropriation, by taking money that wasn’t yours when in a position of trust.

'You fabricated a robbery and caused a considerable waste of police time and resources.

'What you hoped to achieve by reporting the robbery was the writing off of the money you’d taken - money that’s been wasted by you.

'You succumbed to the temptation of putting your hand in the till when you were a post mistress, entrusted by the Post Office with substantial sums.'

He said an immediate jail sentence was 'inevitable and necessary'.

After the hearing, Detective Constable Rob Buckley said: 'When Margaret Player reported the robbery she informed the call handler a firearm was used to threaten her and steal money.

'As a result officers from the armed response team were deployed to the incident.

'The initial response and subsequent inquiries resulted in many police hours being spent on the investigation, the inquiries spanned over two years.

'This was a complex investigation and we hope this case will deter others who may be considering abusing their position of trust.'
