An Australian baseball player who was allegedly shot and killed at random while he was jogging wasn't targeted because of his race or nationality, the prosecutor in charge of the case has said.

Christopher Lane, a 22-year-old student at East Central University, was shot in the back and killed last week while jogging in Duncan, Oklahoma where the three teenagers accused in his killing live.

'At this point, the evidence does not support the theory that Christopher Lane was targeted based upon his race or nationality,' District Attorney Jason Hicks said in a statement on Friday.

Hicks acknowledged that social media posts allegedly made by some of the defendants are racial in nature, but he said 'the evidence is insufficient to establish that race was the primary motive' in Lane's slaying.

Killed: Christopher Lane, a baseball player and student who was shot dead as he went jogging, was not targeted due to his race or nationality, the prosecutor in charge of the case has said

Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards, Jr., 15, have been charged as adults with first-degree murder.

Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, is charged with using a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and with accessory to first-degree murder. He is considered a youthful offender but will be tried in adult court.

Police said Jones told investigators that the three were 'bored' and decided to kill someone for the 'fun of it'.

One of Edwards' friends, Serenity Jackson, told The Associated Press she didn't believe race was a factor in the shooting. She noted that Luna's mother, Edwards' girlfriend and Jones are white.

Suspects: Michael Jones (left) is accused of being an accessory to murder while Chancey Luna (center) and James Edwards (right) face first degree murder charges for the shooting of Christopher Lane

Questionable: Friends claimed Edwards (center) and Luna (right) were trying to join the local chapter 
of the notorious Crips gang, and they posted pictures to their Facebook 
where they are holding gang signs

'It has nothing to do with Chris being white. They didn't even know who he was,' said Jackson, 17, who grew up with Edwards.

It had previously emerged that Edwards
had posted on his Twitter profile that he 'hated white people' and 
boasted that
he beat up five white people - using the derogatory term 'woods' - 
after the George Zimmerman acquittal in the Trayvon Martin case.

'Ayeee I knocced out 5 woods since Zimmerman court!:) lol sh*t ima keep sleepin sh*t! #ayeeee,' he wrote.

In another, he said: '90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM'.

But Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said that 
rather than being part of any gang, which had been suggested before, 
authorities believe the boys were just wannabes who were emulating the 
thuggish beliefs of their idols, with Chief Keef being prime suspect.

It emerged that the day before 
Edwards is alleged to have shot dead Christopher in a drive-by from
a black Ford Focus, he tweeted about rapper Chief Keef.

Two
days earlier he posted a chilling tweet that was a lyric from the 
rapper's song I Don't Like.

It read: 'With my n****s when it's time to 
start taken life's' (sic). Other lyrics in the same song include 'pistol
toting and I'm shooting on sight'.

Ford said: 'These boys were more into 
some rapper that goes around, his music is violent. More than gang 
stuff. One of the parents said something about rap.

'These
boys have no respect for life or authority or society, it doesn't 
matter who it is. By one of their own words, they saw him go by, and 
they said, "there's the target" and they followed him and shot him. He 
could have been anybody walking down the street.'

Tough guy: Edwards posted videos of him tossing around guns and looking threatening in a blue bandana associated with the notorious Crips gang

Random: Police chief Danny Ford said 'it could have been anybody' who was killed that day. But it was Chris Lane (left) and his girlfriend Sarah Harper has talked of her heartbreak at the 'senseless' killing

The boys also posted pictures of themselves doing gang signs with their hands, pretending to use wads of cash as telephones and posing with guns in social media videos.

Victim: Chris Lane, 22, was visiting his girlfriend's family in Duncan, Oklahoma when he was killed

Edwards also changed his profile picture on August 9 to show his face hidden in a blue bandana - typically associated with the Crips and its affiliates - and they are active in Oklahoma. Four Crips were indicted on drugs charges in Tulsa in June.

But Detective John Byers, who is leading the investigation and is the town's gang expert, told MailOnline: 'Jones, the white gentleman, I've not known him to be claiming to be part of any gang.

'On Edward's posts he is throwing up hand signs, but I haven't known him to say he's part of any gang - and we have no knowledge of Luna being involved with the other two before at all.

'I cannot say this is a gang. They knew each other, they hung out. they committed crime. Yes, by classification, to be called a gang, they have to have some kind of initiation and call themselves a certain name, but at this point I can't say they are a gang.

'Social media has played a large part of this investigation.'

Officials believe that Lane was not their first target, though he was their first human victim.

Police
chief Ford said that during their investigation they found a dead 
donkey that had been killed with a shotgun just a block away from where 
Lane was murdered.

Shock: Residents of Duncan have been convulsed by the murder that has attracted worldwide attention

The small town has been rocked by the 
senseless murder that has sent shockwaves around the world, leaving many
wondering what drove the 'bored' boys to apparently kill just for the 
thrill of it.

Because 
of Lane's nationality, the case has gained national attention, but some 
have criticized the White House for not reacting strongly enough.

A
State Department spokeswoman put out a statement last week saying that 
the federal government is 'deeply saddened' by Lane's death but she did 
not comment on any specific action.

Australia's
former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called for his fellow 
countrymen to think of this shooting when they are planning a trip to 
the United States.
