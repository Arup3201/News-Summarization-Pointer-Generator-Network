A jury is deadlocked by one vote in charging a Florida woman with the murder of 4-year-old foster child Rilya Wilson who disappeared after being barbarically locked in a cage more than a decade ago.

Jurors in Miami-Dade County revealed a vote of 11 to 1 on Thursday in charging 67-year-old Geralyn Graham with the child's murder which carries a potential life sentence.

The note did not say which side had the majority or what the verdicts were on kidnapping and aggravated child abuse charges, which carry less severe sentences than murder.

Verdict is in: A verdict in the death of 4-year-old foster child Rilya Wilson, pictured, has been reached by jurors but with a deadlock by one vote on charging a Florida woman with murder

Prosecutors said Graham, who was Rilya's caretaker, smothered the girl with a pillow in December of 2000 before disposing of her body, which has still never been found.

The jury could opt for a less severe manslaughter charge rather than murder. All verdicts must be unanimous.

'All of us are depending on you to make a wise and legal decision in this matter,' Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez told jurors earlier in the day.

After more than three additional hours of deliberations Mendez ordered the panel to return on Friday morning to continue.

Authorities long suspected Graham in Rilya's disappearance, but didn't charge her until 2005 when prosecutors said she confessed to an inmate while serving time on an unrelated fraud charge.

That purported jailhouse confession by Graham to career criminal Robin Lunceford became key evidence against her after Luceford said Graham told her she did it because Rilya was evil and demonic.

Before that in November, shocking court testimony and evidence revealed Rilya was kept in a dog cage, tied to her bed with plastic restraints and forced for long periods to stay in a small laundry room as punishment for disobedience.

'She was being brutalized. She was 
being punished to the extreme,' Assistant State Attorney Sally Weintraub
said in closing arguments.

Prosecutors
brought the wire dog cage into the court room and placed it in front of
the jurors as Graham's friend Detra Coakley Winfield testified she 
loaned it to her specifically to keep the child in.

She
said Graham asked to borrow it and told her it was so she could keep 
the four-year-old in it at night 'to stop her from doing harm to 
herself'.

However she did admit she had never seen her inside the cage.

'I
saw her in timeout but I never saw her in the dog cage,' she said, 
adding that she had never saw Graham strike the child once.

She also said the girl often seemed 'sad' during her eight-month stay at the Graham home and once saw her play with feces.

Lost: Rilya's body has never been found

'To me, she had some issues, some mental issues,' Winfield told jurors.

Rilya's name is an acronym for 'remember I love you always' given by her birth mother.

Graham has always maintained that a child welfare worker took Rilya from her home in January 2001 and never returned her.

Her
disappearance was not discovered for 15 months, leading to major 
reforms at the Florida Department of Children and Families and 
high-level resignations.

A
caseworker who failed to check up on Rilya in person during all those 
months eventually pleaded guilty to official misconduct charges for 
falsifying time sheets.

Graham's
defense raised the possibility Rilya might have been sold and could 
still be alive. They questioned the credibility of Lunceford — whose 
life sentence was cut to 10 years in exchange for her testimony — and 
the fact that no physical evidence exists showing a crime was committed.

'There's no evidence of it because my client never committed murder,' said defense attorney Michael Matters.

Two other prison inmates also testified that Graham implicated herself in Rilya's killing.

Friends
and acquaintances said Graham told various stories about the girl's 
disappearance, such as trips to Disney World and New York. She also told
investigators the girl, who was taken 
into care after being born to a crack-addicted mom, had been taken for mental tests by a state caseworker and never returned.

Authorities found no evidence to back up those explanations.

Before jurors began deliberations, 
three alternates were sent home but instructed by the judge not to talk 
to the media or read news account of the case until a verdict in the 
high-profile case is reached.

In November another family friend, 
Laquica Tuff, told jurors that she saw Rilya with scratches and a gash 
on her forehead about two months before the girl’s disappearance.

She also said Graham told her the same story about her being taken to New York by a friend.

In the afternoon, a crime scene detective dispatched to Graham's home in Kendall in 2004, more than three years after Rilya disappeared and after the family had already moved, testified that little forensic evidence was found at the home except for latent evidence of human bodily fluid or blood in the garage, according to Local10.com.

Graham's attorney raised the possibility that Rilya could still be alive because her body has not been found.

Attorney Scott Sakin suggested Rilya 
could've been relocated to a new home and lost in a system that has a 
history of caseworker incompetence.

Sakin also reminded jurors that jailhouse snitches have much to gain for helping out prosecutors.

'Is there any evidence at all that 
this child is dead?' Sakin said. 'Where is the body? We don't have to 
prove that she's alive. They have to prove that this child is dead.'

Prosecutors said Graham confessed to 
killing Rilya, who would be 16 now, because she believed the girl was 
evil and possessed by demons.

Rilya and a younger sister were both 
given over to state care because their drug-addicted, frequently 
homeless mother could not care for them.

One now-retired DCF supervisor, 
Willie Harris, testified that in April 2000 he received a call from 
Graham claiming Rilya's first foster home was 'deplorable' and might be 
unsafe.

Testimony: Mrs Winfield told the court that she saw the girl in timeout but never saw her in the dog cage she provided, adding that she had never saw Graham strike the child once

Rilya's younger sister was living 
with Graham and her unrelated companion, Pamela Graham, and Rilya had 
recently visited their house.

Harris said he decided to remove 
Rilya from the first foster home when he was denied access to 
investigate its condition. He took the girl to the Grahams' home.

'I thought it would be necessary to 
remove the child because I couldn't prove whether she was at risk or not
at risk,' Harris testified.

The key to the case, both sides agree, is the testimony of career criminal Robin Lunceford, who befriended Graham in jail.

Lunceford claims that Graham, 
referring to Rilya as 'it,' told her she smothered the girl with a 
pillow and buried the remains near water 'because water represented 
peace,' Weintraub told jurors. Another inmate also claims that Graham 
confessed at a different time.

Weintraub said Lunceford was reluctant to snitch but 'couldn't stomach' knowing about the death of a child.

'If you tell me you killed an 
innocent child, I'm going to snitch, and I'm going to snitch proud. 
Because it's different,' Weintraub quoted Lunceford as telling 
detectives.

Lunceford had been facing a life 
sentence as a repeat offender but has had her sentence reduced to 10 
years because of her cooperation, court records show. With time off for 
good behavior, she could be released by the end of December, Sakin 
pointed out.

'She's a rat,' Sakin said. 'Robin Lunceford would do anything, anything, to get out of prison.'

Graham also has a checkered past, 
including a history of convictions for fraud. Authorities said she has 
used 47 different aliases and had 10 different driver's licenses when 
she was arrested.

Weintraub said Graham forged 
documents falsely claiming she was Rilya's grandmother in order to 
collect state benefits — even after police believed the girl was dead.

The trial resumes on Tuesday.
