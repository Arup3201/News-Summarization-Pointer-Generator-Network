The luxury apartment owned by sex symbol actress Heather Graham, 42, suffered a major fire on Saturday night.

Officials say that the blaze probably started after burning candles ignited clothes that were lying close to the bathtub.

The New York Post reported that the fire in Graham's 2,000-square-foot Union Square penthouse began at around 10pm on Saturday and took 45 minutes to extinguish.

'It was candles that maybe caught some clothes that were left near the tub,' FDNY Chief John Bley told the Post.

Graham rushed back to the 12th-floor property after firefighters had put out the blaze. Representatives for Graham have so far declined to comment.

While Graham lives in the penthouse of the Broadway block, she isn't the only famous face to reside in the building.

Zach Braff, actor and director of TV show Scrubs, bought a 2,500-square-foot flat at the same address for $3.2million in 2007.

Braff acquired the property from Broadway legend Tom O’Horgan, director of 1970s musicals Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar.

Graham made her major breakthrough with her role as a young porn star named Brandi in the award-winning 1997 picture Boogie Nights.

Since then she has starred in movies such as Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and The Hangover.

Graham regularly featured in FHM magazine's list of the 100 Sexiest Women in the World and in 2001 People Magazine named her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.

The actress is currently filming her role for The Hangover Part III.
