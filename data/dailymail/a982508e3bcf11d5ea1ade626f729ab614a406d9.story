Arsene Wenger wants to groom new-boy Calum Chambers into an Arsenal middle man.

The Gunners have completed the signing of the right-back from Southampton in a deal that could reach £16million.

Chambers, 19, made the breakthrough at St Mary's as a right-back, where he competed with Nathaniel Clyne for a starting spot.

But Wenger feels the teenager has the attributes to play through the middle - as either a centre-back or defensive midfielder.

Wenger
 feels Chambers has the technical ability and intelligence to be shifted
 inside and wants to nurture the youngster in that mould in the coming 
months.

The Frenchman has already held extensive discussions with his coaching team about his plans for Chambers.

The
 Arsenal manager was at the forefront of the club's move for Chambers, 
having identified the youngster as a target towards the end of last 
year.

Speaking over the weekend Wenger said: 'He 
hasn't played many games but the English players on the market in 
England are very expensive.

'And at the end of the day I was ready to take a gamble because he is a player for the future.

'He
 is a player I wanted because I rated his quality and intelligence, he 
is only 19 and can play in different positions as well.'
