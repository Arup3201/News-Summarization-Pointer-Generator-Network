Ofcom is to canvas the views of thousands of football fans as it probes a complaint by Virgin Media about the way £1.7 billion-a-year Premier League football rights are sold to broadcasters.

Armchair supporters and regular match-goers are to be asked for their views as part of the regulator's inquiry.

Ofcom also said it would be looking at changes in the prices charged by broadcasters for sports channels.

The regulator is in the midst of an investigation after Virgin argued that the English top flight screened fewer live matches than other top European leagues, contributing to higher prices for pay-TV packages.

In an update published on Monday, it said that its probe continued to progress with no decisions reached at this stage and that it was reviewing consumer research it had recently received from Virgin Media.

It added: 'Ofcom will also carry out new consumer research, which will canvas views of fans who attend matches and those who watch them on TV.

'It will look at the value viewers place on watching the Premier League. We will also be monitoring changes in retail prices of sports channels as the investigation progresses.'

The fans' research will build on views already sought from football bodies, clubs, fans' groups, broadcasters and policing organisations.

Virgin had argued that the latest Premier League rights auction should be suspended as Ofcom probed the process, but the regulator declined and allowed the sale to go ahead last month.

It resulted in Sky and BT paying a combined £5.14 billion to screen top-flight games for the 2016-2019 seasons, a 70 per cent increase on the current deal.

Ofcom said prior to the auction that there was no 'urgent need' to delay it and that it was carrying out its probe 'expeditiously' given that the auctioned matches will start to be broadcast from August 2016.

It said it had the power necessary to alter broadcasting arrangements before this time, should its probe find there had been an infringement of competition rules.
