Breaking Amish star Kate Stotlz has opened up about how her strict religious family vehemently disapprove of her lingerie modeling career.

The New York-based 23-year-old, who landed her first major job with men's magazine Maxim last year, said: 'If I were to even show my 
father face to face a lingerie picture that I took he would probably 
burn it and tell me that I'm going to hell.

'The Amish think that modelling is one of the worst things a woman can do, they see it as flaunting your body and being vain.'

Not for mom and dad to see: Breaking Amish star Kate Stotlz has opened up about how her strict religious family vehemently disapprove of her lingerie modeling career

Changed: Miss Stoltz, a bishop's daughter, is pictured in 2012 as she appeared on TLC's show, Breaking Amish

Growing up Miss Stoltz, born Kate Stoltzfus, was even forbidden from having her picture taken fully-dressed because of traditional Amish beliefs.

Like the other women in her family, she would wear conservative ankle-length dresses, a smock and bonnet.

On top of school work she spent hours in the fields pitching hay as well as cooking, cleaning and looking after her family. There were no electronics in the house.

Looking back on her old life, the pretty brunette said: 'Before school I would go out and feed the cows.Â

Making headlines: Miss Stotlz also appeared in the New York Post, when the newspaper covered the 100th anniversary of the brassiere

'After
 school I'd take care of the calves, I make dinner for the family and 
spend about six hours at a time just out in the fields raking hay.'

But in 2012 the Miss Stoltz turned her back on her ultra-strict upbringing to appear in TLC's reality TV show Breaking Amish.

The series followed a group of Amish and Mennonite youngsters as they had their first taste of modern life in New York. After appearing on the small screen, Miss Stoltz's life changed overnight.

Her good looks caught the attention of Major Model Management and she was immediately signed up by the European and U.S.-based agency.

Now the 5ft 8in beauty sets pulses racing with saucy underwear shoots.

Talking about her move from rural Pennsylvania to Manhattan, Miss Stoltz recalled: 'I actually found it really hard to get used to New York because it's so loud and there's so many people.'

And the bishop's daughter had to deal with the disapproval of the community she left behind.

'I
 mean my dad's a minister in the church, he of course does not approve 
but then again he also knows that he can't control my life.'

Lingerie modeling wasn't the first time Miss Stoltz had broken the rules of her strict faith.

During Breaking Amish, she was forced to admit she had been arrested for a DUI before the show.

Blogs
 also revealed she had previously submitted images to modeling agencies -
 which is at odds with the Amish stance against photographs, believing 
they represent 'vanity' which they deem a sin.

Online
 records show that Kate posted a photograph on exploretalent.com to 
enter a Best Smile contest in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave 
up her Amish life to move to the city.

Despite the radical change in her lifestyle, Miss Stoltz is still very close to her family.

She said: 'Even though they don't approve of my lifestyle they're always telling me to come back home.

Leaving the past behind: Miss Stoltz says she has no desire to return to the Amish way of life

'I couldn't ask for better parents or better brothers and sisters.'

With
 no desire to return to the Amish way of life Miss Stoltz is making plans for 
her future and will appear in a second TLC spinoff series called Return to Amish this June.

She said: 'I actually have really big hopes and plans for the future.

'I
 want to be on a billboard in the middle of Times Square and I want to 
be the first person in my family to ever have a college education.

'Now
 that I'm outside of that I realise the world is so large and the only 
thing that matters is who you are and whether or not you're happy.'
