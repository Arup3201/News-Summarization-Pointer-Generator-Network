England may have been severely disappointing at the World Cup in Brazil, but that didn't stop Wayne Rooney's son Kai from reliving his dad's only highlight on Ipanema beach.

Although Rooney Snr. managed to score his first ever goal at the tournament, England were defeatedÂ  2-1 by a Luis Suarez-inspired Uruguay on Thursday. And, their fate was sealed the next day when Costa Rica beat Italy making it impossible for England to qualify from Group D.

Despite being seen crying during the defeat to Uruguay, four-year-old Kai had obviously moved on from the disappointment as he enjoyed a kickabout on the beach watched by his mother Coleen.

The Rooney family, including youngest son Klay, have travelled to Brazil to support Wayne and will be saddened to leave disappointed, despite seeing the Manchester United striker end his World Cup drought.

Moments after the game Rooney's wife Coleen took to her Twitter account to say: 'Gutted with the score, but so pleased @WayneRooney scored and his boys were here to see it!!'

Rooney has been heavily criticised for his performances in Brazil, despite arriving at the tournament in better condition than he has done in the past.

There were calls for him to be dropped from the starting XI after England lost 2-1 to Italy in their opening game and, although he was more effective in a central role against Uruguay, many fans were still left unimpressed.
