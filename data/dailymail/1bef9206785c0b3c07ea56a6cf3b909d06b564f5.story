Fashion month may be drawing to a close but the heavyhitters in Paris are still impressing with their statement collections.

Today's showstopping offering came courtesy of  design duo Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, who run the hugely popular Kenzo label.

Known and loved among the fash-pack for their statement sweatshirts and slouchy cuts, SS15 looks set to be full of wide trousers, laser-cut cotton and plenty of denim. 

New style essentials: Los Angeles-based design duo Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, who run the hugely popular Kenzo label, unveiled their SS15 collection at Paris fashion week today

The showspace was a transformed skatepark on the outskirts of Paris - the most fitting location for the super cool brand.

While the designs themselves were sleek and minimalistic, it was the shapes that did all the talking.

Boxy jackets were updated for summer by being teamed with floaty maxi dresses, while stripey shirts were worn with drop-hem skirts and kitten heel sandals. 

The colour palette, much like the clothes, was pared-back with head-to-toe white, slate greys and pastel blues and pinks reigning supreme.

And it wasn't just the clothes that took on the bigger is better mantra; accessories, including leather toes and sunglasses, were larger than life. 

Speaking about the collection, the Telegraph's Lisa Armstrong said: 'Humberto Leon and Carol Lim know how to serve up fashion without a shred of portentous dirginess and they're not afraid of a trend.

'The shorter Kenzo fan may not be the most elegant creature on the street if she takes on very much of this stuff. But she'll certainly look as though she's enjoying herself.'

Accessories all areas: It wasn't just the clothes that took on the bigger is better mantra; accessories, including leather toes and sunglasses, were larger than life
