Spaniard Carlos Velasco Carballo wore the referee's kit, but he wasn't in charge for this quarter final in Fortaleza.

The refereeing at this World Cup has been consistently lenient. Teams will have noted that and now know that they have a licence to foul, particularly gifted opponents like James Rodriguez.

Time and time again the dangerous Rodriguez was blocked, tripped and body checked. Yet, Paulinho and his Brazil team-mates escaped sanction. What the Tottenham man has to do to get a yellow card at this tournament I do not know.

Fouling: Paulinho was a constant offender but was not booked by the referee

Ouch: Fernandinho was another who emerged without a booking despite making several fouls

Even when Colombia got a free-kick in a promising position, Carballo ignored the Brazilians charging the ball down from perhaps six yards. A caution for the defender and a retake was the correct decision.

With the hosts a goal up but facing a determined Colombian side they elected to ignore the beautiful game and resort to foul tactics to progress to the semi-final.

The second half of a promising game deteriorated into a petty ugly affair in which Carballo was happy to award free-kicks but nothing else – until it was too late.

Frustratingly when Rodriguez committed a minor foul, he was cautioned adding fuel to the fire that Brazil are enjoying every perceived advantage of being a home team.

If this continues they must surely lift their sixth World Cup. That David Luiz scored the winner from the free-kick added insult to injury.

Finally: Julio Cesar and Thiago Silva were booked as the referee eventually got tough with hosts Brazil

Paying the price: James Rodriguez fouled Hulk for the free kick that led to David Luiz's goal

In the book: Rodriguez was also booked as Colombia were sent crashing out by the hosts on Friday

While Carballo did nothing to impress his assistant worked well and rightly flagged for offside to disallow Mario Yepes effort.

It is hard to give Carballo any credit for finally giving a decision against Brazil when Julio Cesar hacked Carlos Bacca down.

Carballo made his name in La Liga for being a strict disciplinarian but FIFA instructions have clearly affected a number of referees in this tournament and it is highly unlikely that will change in the remaining six games.

The question now is whether the referee for Brazil’s semi-final will be strong enough to ensure fair play – and that referee could well be Howard Webb.
