Tying your shoelaces is a simple enough task, but one that proved to be life changing for Beth Dorrington.

The obese mother was motivated to lose 6st in 12 months after getting out of breath one day as she bent to tie her shoes.

The 35-year-old had piled on weight after her love for takeaways saw her eating four or five fast food meals a week for dinner.

But when she got out of breath simply from bending down to tie up her shoes, Beth knew she had to do something about it. 

Beth managed to drop from 18st (left) to 11st 13lb (right) in just a year 

Beth has now managed to lose more than 6st after joining her local Slimming World group and is a much healthier 11st 13lb.

She said: 'I needed a bigger uniform at work as mine was too tight but it meant asking for a size 26.

'There was no way I was going to the office to ask for that size.

'I had also seen pictures from a recent hen do. I had not noticed how big I had got.'

Beth has swapped take-aways for homemade healthy foods in moderate portions 

But she said it was not always easy to stick to her diet.

'It was daunting walking through the doors of Slimming World for the first time,' she added.

'My son is 14 and came with me for moral support. I lost four pounds in my first Week. From then on the journey has just gone up and up.

'I've had times where I've slipped a little but I was determined. Remembering what I looked like before was the motivation to keep on going.

'I have made big changes to my diet, I used to love takeaways and would have four or five a week.

'Now I'm making much better choices. Everything I eat now is in moderation and I make sure I'm eating at the right time.'

Beth, from Hardwicke, Glos., used to gorge on Chinese and Indian takeaways as well as chocolate bars, burger, chips and kebabs.

But since starting her new diet she now eats homemade lean meat kebabs, stews, homemade pizzas and fresh vegetables and salad.

A recent weight loss study by the University of Sheffield claimed that people from wealthy areas are more likely to have used slimming clubs than people from more deprived areas. 

Buth Beth maintains that weight loss is not just about being able to afford signing up to a club.

'It is a myth that these kind of clubs are expensive and people in poor areas are obese because they can't afford to attend,' she said.

'It's about getting the right dietary advice and sticking to it.'
