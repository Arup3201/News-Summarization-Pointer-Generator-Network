James Dasaolu has predicted Britain’s ‘golden era’ of sprinters will dominate at this week’s European Athletics Championships.

And he insisted they are poised to shake up the Jamaican and American stronghold over athletics’ blue riband events.

Dasaolu, the second fastest European in history after Linford Christie, admitted it would be an underachievement if he fails to win a medal in the 100 metres final in Zurich on Wednesday evening.

Ambitions: James Dasaolu wants to help see in an era of British sprinting dominance starting in Zurich

‘I’m going into the competition as the second ranked (behind France’s Jimmy Vicaut) so, on paper, I should pick up a medal. That’s what expected of me.’

The 26-year-old ran 9.91sec in 2013 but has struggled with a hamstring injury and has only competed three times this year.

His first challenge will be proving he is physically durable enough to advance through the rounds unscathed. ‘I feel like my late start to the season has worked to my advantage,’ said Dasaolu, ‘I’m quite fresh and I’ve still got a lot to give. It took four or five races last year to reach my peak.

‘I fancy there will be quite a few British men on the podium in the 100m and the 200m, ‘Seeing me and Chijindu Ujah go sub-10 and a number of guys go 10.1 (sec) and lots of medals at the Commonwealth Games, you just want to continue this on.

‘Confidence is high and we believe we can beat the best in the world and challenge the Jamaicans and Americans. I think it’s important we continue to win medals in the sprints and relays to grow that confidence.’

Dasaolu was overlooked for selection for Team England at the Commonwealth Games and watched on TV as Adam Gemili, 20, won a silver medal in the 100m, splitting Jamaicans Kemar Bailey-Cole and Nickel Ashmeade. Gemili will run in the 200m in Zurich, while Dasaolu will compete alongside Dwain Chambers and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey.

‘I’m disappointed I wasn’t there but I can only look forward,’ he said, ‘Adam’s living up to his potential now and got a medal. He’s a championship performer and he produced on the day.’

Dasaolu said he was a ‘better athlete’ now than when he ran 9.91sec last year but claimed he was not thinking about breaking Linford Christie’s British record of 9.87sec, which has stood since 1993. His main opposition in Europe will be France’s Jimmy Vicaut, who clocked 9.95sec in May.

‘I never really think about times but British sprinters are expected to pick up medals at the Europeans if you want to compete against the best in the world.’

On the back of his Commonwealth gold medal, Greg Rutherford said he was prepared that he might have to beat his own British long jump medal to win gold again in Zurich. Rutherford recorded a jump of 8.51 metres in Chula Vista in San Diego in April.

‘I have not been jumping like that since,’ he said, ‘but I caught one at the Commonwealths which filled me with confidence. I might have to go 51 (to win in Zurich. Aleksandr Menkov (from Russia) jumped 56 last year and if he’s on point it can happen

‘Apparently the track is amazing, so from that point of view it could be a very exciting competition.’
