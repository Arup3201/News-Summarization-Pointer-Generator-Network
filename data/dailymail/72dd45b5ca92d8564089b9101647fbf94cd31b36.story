Hackers: The logo of LulzSec, who Team Poison have threatened to expose the names of its members

A rival hacking group has threatened to name each of the members of LulzSec.

TeaMp0ison, (Team Poison) are racing against the police to expose the names of those involved with the group, who have already brought down Sony, Sega and the FBI.

LulzSec’s members use a range of pseudonyms to cover their tracks while exposing others. They include 'Sabu', the groups alleged leader, Nakomis and Topiary.

Now though, a member of Team Poison has claimed it will show their true identities.

In an interview with Fox News, Hex0010, a member of the group said: 'We're here to show the world that they're nothing but a bunch of script kiddies.

'We're going to let them do what they do. Then we're going to do what we do,’ he said. 'We're going to hit them hard.'

Hex, who refused to reveal his true name, claimed the next person to be identified would be from California. He would not reveal further details.

The claim come just days after police named the first alleged LulzSec member as Ryan Cleary, a 19-year-old from Essex who was arrested on Monday.

Cleary was later charged with a five offences and appeared in court yesterday.

The loner is said to be helping 
police with their probe into the organisation, with officers given three
extra days to question him about offences in America.

The outcome of the investigation could lead to Cleary being extradited.

LulzSec has since distanced itself from the teenager, using a Twitter account to claim the British police were 'desperate' and that they had arrested 'someone who is, at best, mildly associated with us.'

However Hex believes that Cleary is connected with the group.

'Depends on how you look at it,' he continued. 'You can say he's one of the people that ran it, you can say he's a middleman. Depends on how you look at it. I think he's a middleman.'

TeamPoison yesterday upped its attacks on users it believes are connected to LulzSec by defacing the website of Sven Slootweg.

Slootweg, also known as Joepie, has been linked to the group but quickly issued a statement denying his involvement.

He said: 'I am not a member of LulzSec (a statement I have made several times before in various places).’

Team Poison’s threats come just days after another hacking group, named Team Web Ninjas posted what they claimed where names, addresses, phone numbers and even pictures of what it considered LulzSec members.

The group claimed that Sabu, a 34-year-old Brazillian, was the group's leader. They claimed to have full details but did not publish them.

They also claimed that Slootweg was a member, alongside freelance journalist Barret Brown and a member of the U.S. Marines named Casey Gardiner.

Team Poison are closely affiliated to the 'Mujahdeen Hacking Unit',  which attacked Facebook in December 2010.

They also have connections with the 'Pakistan Cyber Army'.

Both groups are said to be anti-U.S., anti-Israel and anti-India.

The group of computer hackers that infiltrated Sony and the CIA has leaked confidential details of law enforcement officers from Arizona in its latest on-line raid.

LulzSec owned up to posting personal e-mails, intelligence bulletins, names, addresses and phoen numbers belonging to state Department of Public Safety workers.

It said it carried out the hack because of opposition to an anti-immigrant bill that has been passed in Arizona.

Several DPS workers said that within minutes of their details going on the Internet they had started receiving malicious phone calls and were trying to change their numbers.

The raid came after LulzSec claimed credit for hacking into Sony's system and gaining access to data on its 100 million usersIt also defaced the PBS website and attacked the U.S. Senate and the CIA website.

The new attack was on the Arizona Department of Public Safety because of the state's tough immigration enforcement law known as SB1070.LulzSec said in a statement it objected to the 'the racial profiling anti-immigrant police state that is Arizona'.

It also plans to release 'more classified documents and embarrassing personal details of military and law enforcement' until its undisclosed demands are met.

DPS officer Daniel Scott told the Washington Post that he had to get a new telephone number after his was posted on the Internet.

'I've never had it happen before. It's getting real annoying,' he said.'I let the department know and hopefully they can figure it out. I might have to change my phone number. It's all over the world.'

Steven Loya, another DPS officer, also had his email and home address posted on-line.

'Well, they got my cellphone. It's not a good thing,' he told the Post.LulzSec started as an offshoot of hacking collective 4chan but has become notorious of late after British teenager Ryan Cleary was charged over his alleged involvement with LulzSec in cyber attacks on the CIA website.

One of the charges also relates to bringing down the website of Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency - the U.K.'s FBI equivalent - using a flood of traffic, in what is known as a 'distributed denial of service' attack.LulzSec has already taken revenge on two people it claimed had 'snitched' on them and landed Cleary in custody.

And in a further sign of unrest a rival hacking group has now vowed to take down LulzSec members one by one as rivalry between such collectives intensifies.

A member of TeaMp0isoN - pronounced Team Poison - said it would dismantle LulzSec because they were considered to be amateurs.'We're a group that consists of political hackers,' the 23-year-old calling himself 'Hex' said.

'A lot of people consider us being a religious type thing -- in reality it's not. When international governments are doing wrong and trying to hide from it, we're there.'

Arizona DPS spokesman Steve Harrison confirmed its computer system had been breached and that additional security measures were being taken.

A spokesman for the FBI's Phoenix division added it was aware of the situation but would not say if it was investigating.
