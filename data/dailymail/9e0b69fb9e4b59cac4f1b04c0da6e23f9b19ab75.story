They met last summer in Ibiza and their friendship has recently blossomed into romance.

And it's no wonder Barcelona football star Neymar seems smitten with his new girlfriend Soraja Vucelic after she was spotted showing off her amazing bikini body on Puro Beach in Tivat, Montenegro.

The 28-year-old Serbian beauty - who is famous in her home country for appearing on Big Brother - donned a barely-there two-piece with a black and white striped pattern.

Soraja flaunted her toned stomach and perfectly proportioned curves as she splashed around in the shadows, milking her moment in the spotlight.

The Brazil captain has reportedly been pulling out all the stops to keep his holiday romance with the tanned beauty alive.

According to Belgrade-based tabloid Kurir, the couple have kept in touch via Skype since their initial Ibiza encounter.

They had apparently agreed that Soraja would fly over to visit Neymar in Barcelona at the end of October, but then decided they couldn't wait that long.

The football ace reportedly sent a private plane to fly her over to Spain for a visit, where she stayed for several days.

Neymar was previously dating Brazilian beauty Bruna Marquezine, who was by his side during the 2014 World Cup.

However, the pair reportedly called it quits in August.
