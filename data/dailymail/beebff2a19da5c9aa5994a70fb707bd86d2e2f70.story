The secretive nation of North Korea had given away the status of its nuclear arms program months before its controversial leader, Kim Jong Un, openly declared he would order nuclear strikes, it was revealed today.

Newsweek/Daily Beast today exclusively revealed that the country, known as much for its nuclear weapons as for its propaganda, had the resources to launch a nuclear attack in December.

Part of a rocket launched by North Korea in December was recovered by U.S. officials, who then determined the true threat the nation posed.

The debris provided valuable insight into what had been happening beyond the De-militarized Zone in the capital of Pyongyang.

Sources told the website that members of
 the U.S. Navy recovered what was assumedly a fuel container last 
December, and revealed how exactly a nuclear missile could be deployed.

The discarded rocket revealed much about North Korea’s capacity to launch a nuclear attack. ‘We looked at the wreckage from the launch, and we put it together with other kinds of intelligence and came to this judgement that they had figured out the warhead piece,’ a non-proliferation official told the Daily Beast.

The officials’ confirmation coincides with a bungled report from the Pentagon that was mistakenly released earlier this month after marked ‘unclassified.’

The papers detailed that they have ‘moderate confidence’ that Pyongyang is able to launch ballistic missiles armed with nuclear weapons

In the report, a Pentagon agency concluded for the first time that the secretive country could have a likely ability to launch a nuclear-armed missile at its enemies, although this was later played down by the Obama administration.

The document, called ‘Dynamic Threat Assessment 8099: North Korea Nuclear Weapons Program,’ is from March of 2013. 

However, shortly after its release by Rep. Dough Lamborn, R-Colorado, Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a statement that there was little reason to be immediately alarmed.

‘It would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed, or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in this passage,’ the statement reads.

‘The United States continues to closely monitor the North Korean nuclear program and calls upon North Korea to honor its international obligations.’

While the rest of the world hears whispers and rumors of nuclear demise, North Koreans themselves today set aside their fear-mongering and bravado to celebrate the birthday of their first leader, Kim Il Sung.

Girls in red and pink jackets skipped along streets of the capital of Pyongyang, festooned with celebratory banners and flags and boys on inline skates took a break to slurp up bowls of shaved ice.

There was no sense of panic in the North Korean capital, where very few locals have access to international broadcasts and foreign newspapers speculating about an imminent missile launch and detailing the international diplomacy under way to try to rein Pyongyang in.

Elsewhere in the region, however, the focus remained on the threat of a launch as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry wrapped up a tour to coordinate Washington's response with Beijing, North Korea's most important ally, as well as with Seoul and Tokyo.

In Seoul, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin told a parliamentary committee Monday that North Korea still appeared poised to launch a missile from its east coast, though he declined to disclose the source of his information.

Kerry warned North Korea not to conduct a missile test, saying it would be provocation that 'will raise people's temperatures' and further isolate the country and its impoverished people.

He said Sunday that the U.S. was 'prepared to reach out,' but that Pyongyang must first bring down tensions and honor previous agreements.
