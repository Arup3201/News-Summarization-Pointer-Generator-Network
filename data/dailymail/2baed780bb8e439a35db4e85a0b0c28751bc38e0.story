The Prime Minister’s own music collection is – apparently – packed with trendy new bands and obscure artists.

But it seems his supporters have slightly more mainstream tastes.

Those who admire David Cameron are likely to be fans of Cliff Richard, Dolly Parton and Kylie Minogue, according to a survey.

Supporters of Ed Miliband, on the other hand, probably listen to John Lennon or Leonard Cohen – while those who favour Nick Clegg are keen on Norah Jones, and Nigel Farage’s followers like Kate Bush.

Mr Cameron himself revealed earlier this year that he is a fan of little-known Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit and had been to one of their gigs. 

He has previously said he owns an album by British folk rock band Mumford and Sons, and on Desert Island Discs he picked tracks by Pink Floyd, REM and The Killers.

The new research, by pollster YouGov, found voters who back the Prime Minister count actor Tom Cruise and Top Gear stars Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond among their favourite celebrities.

Admirers of Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg are likely to be fans of Evan Davis, the new host of Newsnight.

And perhaps unsurprisingly, celebrities favoured by Mr Farage’s supporters include Mike Read, the former Radio 1 DJ who recently wrote and sang a controversial song in praise of Ukip, as well as Carry On star Sid James.

 When it comes to food, the preferred dishes of Mr Miliband’s supporters are vegetarian ones, with mushroom stroganoff at the top of the list. 

Those who like Mr Cameron favour a more exotic Malay prawn satay, as well as Beluga caviar and lobster.

The survey – based on information from 200,000 respondents to YouGov’s online polls – found fans of pro-EU Mr Clegg enjoy watching the Eurovision Song Contest, as well as the BBC Ten O’Clock News and the Andrew Marr Show.

Supporters of Ukip leader Mr Farage are more likely to shop at discount supermarket Lidl, drive a Land Rover and enjoy DIY as a hobby. Their favourite TV shows are Dad’s Army, Doc Martin and Top Gear.

The programmes preferred by Mr Cameron’s supporters include, perhaps more predictably, Prime Minister’s Questions, along with Downton Abbey and Top Gear.

Mr Cameron’s fans are also more likely to shop at Waitrose and drive a Mercedes-Benz – and to name driving as one of their favourite activities.

Mr Miliband’s supporters own Citroen cars and watch game show Only Connect, while listing writing as their top hobby. 

Mr Clegg’s fans like to drive an Alfa Romeo, dine on Vichyssoise soup – a chilled leek and potato creation – and take an interest in computer programming.

Clegg enthusiasts named Hot Gossip, Norah Jones and Wings among their favourite musicians

The poll also found that fans of Margaret Thatcher probably shop at Tesco and enjoy game pie, while admirers of Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, who comes from Scotland, love roast venison, venison pie and venison casserole. 

Mr Davis yesterday seemed taken aback by his popularity among supporters of Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg, writing on Twitter: ‘Oh wow, I’m not sure what to make of that.’

But he should perhaps take heart from the fact that those who liked Mr Miliband also described themselves as being ethical, principled and compassionate, while Mr Clegg’s fans said they were analytical, clever and well-educated.

Meanwhile, those who supported Mr Cameron and Mr Farage said they were leaders, dogmatic and firm-minded.
