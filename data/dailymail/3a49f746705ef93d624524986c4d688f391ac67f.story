It is a remarkable fact that the difference in time between when the Stegosaurus and T-rex roamed the Earth is greater than the distance in time between the T-rex and today.

And now one man has created an ingenious infographic to show the evolution of these dinosaurs in all their incredible diversity.

The unusual circular diagram details the rise and fall of the Dinosauria from its appearance in the early Triassic, 231 million years ago, to its virtual total extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period 66 million years ago.

The infographic covers the rise and fall of Dinosauria, as shown on this timeline. Dinosaurs are thought to have been wiped out by a massive asteroid impact that created a dust cloud capable of blocking out sunlight for a year. It also released acidic gasses into the atmosphere, known as the Palaeogene extinction event

Dinosaurs are thought to have been wiped out by a massive asteroid impact. This impact created a dust cloud capable of blocking out sunlight for a year, as well as releasing acidic gasses into the atmosphere, commonly known as the Palaeogene extinction event.

Three quarters of plant and animal life on Earth was annihilated, and the only dinosaurs to survive were those of the clade Avialae, which evolved into what we know today as birds.

Graphic designer Simon Tyler, 36, took a staggering 180 hours to create his dinosaur family tree, based upon research from the Smithsonian Museum, the University of Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley.

The design is known as a phylogenetic tree and Tyler’s creation starts in the centre from which the timeline and epochs radiate.

He chose this design to make it easy to see the wide range of dinosaur shapes and sizes that evolved around the later period of the tree – the Cretaceous – which is coloured in blue.

The dinosaurs featured on the tree are ordered in size from the smallest to the largest and while they are in proportion, they are different scales as the creatures ranged from between 1.9ft (60cm) and 85ft (26 metres), which is impossible to fit on a tree, according to the designer.

‘There are obviously hundreds of distinct dinosaur species, and the selection on the poster was chosen to offer as wide representation of the differing forms and sizes at different points in time as possible,’ Tyler told MailOnline.

The creature at the centre of the tree is Euparkeria, an archosauriform.

The archosaur group eventually evolved into dinosaurs, so this creature marks the beginning of the family tree.

It then splits into two branches – one for saurischian dinosaurs and the other being ornithischian dinosaurs. The distinction is based upon their differing hip structure. 

Saurischian
 dinosaurs had hips like a lizard, whereas ornithischian dinosaurs had 
hips more like modern birds, with a pubic bone pointing downwards 
towards their tails. This is a little confusing as modern birds evolved 
from the saurischia.

An
 early member of the group saurischia was Chindesaurus - a small 
carnivorous beast that walked on two feet and measured 6.5ft (two metres) long.

Sauropods such as Brachiosaurus (pictured) and Isisaurus are included in the family tree as well as Diplodocus and Apatosaurus (formerly known as Brontosaurus)

This clade - a group of organisms consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants - included the largest land animals that have ever existed, the later members of which are known as titanosaurs.

Sauropods such as Brachiosaurus and Isisaurus are included in the family tree as well as Diplodocus and Apatosaurus (formerly known as Brontosaurus).

However, it also evolved in a different direction too, to include therapods, which were mainly carnivorous bipedal dinosaurs. Early therapods were quite small, such as Coelyphysis at 9.8ft (three metres) long, and Elaphrosaurus at 19.6ft (six metres).

Later therapods include the most well-known large carnivorous dinosaurs including Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Spinosaurus.

Shown on the right-hand side of the infographic, most herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs evolved hard beaks. One of the earliest was Pisanosaurus which was around 3.2ft (one metre) long

Avialae - which evolved into modern birds - and coelurosauria - which include the Tyrannosaurus - are both parts of a clade known as avetherapoda.

Avialae then branched off and is represented on the chart by Archaeopteryx – a feathered flying dinosaur around the size of a modern raven.

Most herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs, which are shown on the right-hand side of the graphic, evolved hard beaks. One of the earliest was Pisanosaurus, which was around 3.3ft (one metre) long.

Like various other dinosaurs (including the therapod Coelyphysis on the graphic), Pisanosaurus is thought to have been at least partially feathered based on the recovered fossils.

A group of dinosaurs known as ‘shield bearers’ because of their armoured skin, evolved into the group stegosauria – represented by Stegosaurus in the infographic – and ankylosauria. They all had very small brains considering their size.

The brain of stegosaurus was around the same size as a modern dog’s, despite that fact the dinosaur was 29.5ft (nine metres) long.

Meanwhile, non-armoured dinosaurs called ornithopoda – represented by Hypsilophodon and Zalmoxes – evolved an effective jaw structure for chewing grass, and grazed on plains.

Another group called ceratopsia, which included Triceratops, existed towards the end of the Cretaceous period alongside therapod predators such as the T-rex and Giganotosaurus.

The final group shown on the infographic is pachycephalosauria represented by a dinosaur called Dracorex. The dinosaur was bipedal with a heavily armoured body and spiky horns, which it probably used to head-butt predators.

Each dinosaur, such as this Hypsilophodon, took between six and eight hours to draw using Adobe Illustrator and are based on the most up-to-date thinking about how dinosaurs looked - particularly the feathered ones

The only known species of Dracorex is Dracorex hogwartsia, which was named by children because it resembles the fictional dragons in Harry Potter.

There is a lot of information packed into one infographic, which is available as a poster from Tyler’s graphic design company Atomic Printworks for £25.

‘The colours are a tiny bit more playful, as it's pretty obvious that there's no way anyone could have truly accurate evidence of that kind,’ Tyler explained.

He decided to make such detailed posters for children and adults alike after his two-year-old daughter asked him what a hydrothermal vent is.

‘I realised that kids are just like information sponges - if you present them with interesting things in a bright, clear and fun format, they absorb it so easily.’

Having studied biochemistry and the history of science at university, Tyler, of St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex, set to work creating accurate posters from dinosaurs to space shuttles.

‘I think the subject of dinosaurs is one of those amazing entry points into the wonders of natural science in that they're so bizarre and otherworldly that they captivate young minds,' he said.

He plans on creating more posters about science, technology, engineering and maths as well as a series of illustrated books in which a chimp character called Professor Plasma will tackle quantum physics for the under-fives.
