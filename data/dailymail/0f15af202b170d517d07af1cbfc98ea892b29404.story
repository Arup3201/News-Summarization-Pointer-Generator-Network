The poorest people in society have eight fewer teeth by their seventies than the richest, a study has found.

While it is already known that there is a strong link between socio-economic status and oral health, the research reveals the full extent of the problem.

It shows a shocking discrepancy between the dental conditions enjoyed by the richest 20 per cent of society compared with the poorest.

For those aged over 65, the least well-off averaged eight fewer teeth than the richest – a quarter of a full set.

More than 6,000 people aged 21 and over from all income groups were involved in the British study, published today in the Journal of Dental Research.

Those with lower incomes, a lower occupational class, higher levels of deprivation and lower educational attainment had the worst oral health.

This includes having more tooth decay, gum disease and tooth gaps, as well as having fewer teeth.

But despite these social differences, the overall oral health of young British adults is much better than it used to be.

The study was a collaboration between Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust, University College London and the National Centre for Social Research.

Professor Jimmy Steele, head of the dental school at Newcastle University, said: 'It's probably not a big surprise that poorer people have worse dental health than the richest, but the surprise is just how big the differences can be and how it affects people.

'Eight teeth less on average is a huge amount and will have had a big impact.' 

Dr Georgios Tsakos, senior lecturer at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at UCL, said education was key.

'In terms of the younger adults, we showed that it is not only being poor that affects their perceptions about their oral health and quality of life, but educational attainment can also make a major difference.

'This has profound implications for policy as intervening in earlier life could have a significant long term effect on oral health,' he said.

John Wildman, professor of health economics at Newcastle University Business School, and the Principal Investigator on the ESRC study, said the issue has not been given enough attention.

'Inequalities in oral health have not received the attention that they deserve. Our study is an attempt to redress this balance. Oral health contributes hugely to everyday wellbeing and addressing these inequalities may result in considerable improvements in quality of life for large numbers of individuals,' he said.

Professor Richard Watt, head of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at UCL, referred to the policy implications of this research.

'Inequalities in oral health require urgent action by organisations such as Public Health England - in particular more needs to be done to tackle the underlying causes of oral diseases such as sugary diets,' he said.

One example is Sydney Alcock, 68, a shoemaker from Washington, Tyne and Wear, who was a keen trombonist in a brass band.

He lost all his teeth at a young age due to suffering from gum disease, primarily caused by poor oral hygiene, and has struggled ever since.

He has never smoked regularly and says he did not have too much sugar in his diet.

'You can't play the trombone without any teeth', he said.

'I have had false teeth but they don't last, so losing my teeth has made a big impact on my life. It costs a lot of money for false teeth.

'When I was young we didn't have milk or eggs, or much other dairy, we had to eat powdered eggs. I'm sure that has had an impact on how good my teeth were.'
