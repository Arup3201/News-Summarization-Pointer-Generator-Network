Temperatures are set to nudged a record breaking 21C from the start of next week as Britain enjoys an Indian summer - but forecasters have warned not to get used to it.

The brief spell of unseasonable warmth could precede a polar plunge, bringing England’s first snow of winter by Friday, according to Meteorologists.

This year is already Britain’s 
'strangest-ever' for weather, the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology 
said, with the worst drought since 1976 followed by the wettest summer 
for a century.

But the erratic climate has a few more 
surprised in store in the coming days, delivering a taste of three 
seasons in a week - as a golden autumnal weekend is being followed by 
summer and winter snaps.

The
Met Office said most parts were having a weekend of long sunny spells 
once morning fog lifts - perfect for autumn walks amid glorious colours.

Only the cloudier South will see occasional rain tomorrow.

African air will deliver Indian Summer temperatures from Monday.

With
Halloween just a week away, The Weather Channel forecast a 50 per cent 
chance of topping 20C in the South, nudging the October 23 temperature 
record of 21.4C at Anglesey, Wales, in 1996.

Three Day Weather Graphic

The Met Office predicted temperatures 
in the 'high teens' but the potential for higher if clouds bringing 
'blood rain' showers ease.

Tonight:

Britain should expect cloud with outbreaks of rain, particularly in southern counties, which will clear more western and northern areas by the early hours of the morning. The minimum temperature is expected to fall to 8C.

Sunday:

Early low cloud will slowly clear leaving the occasional shower in the south. Temperatures will peak at 15C.

Monday to Wednesday:

Monday, rather cloudy and misty with occasional rain. Tuesday and Wednesday will be mainly dry with broken cloud, some pleasant bright or sunny spells, although with brisk east winds. Mild.

Forecasters said Saharan dust is expected to leave red-tinged sand stains on cars. Holland had blood rain today.

But forecasters warned of a 'very 
potent' Arctic plunge from Thursday, with snow in the East, North and 
Wales by Friday and the South at risk next weekend, the Weather Outlook,
WeatherOnline and British Weather Services said.

The
Met Office claimed it was 'too early' to assess the snow risk - but 
confirmed colder air would push nights close to freezing in the North.

Days are forecast to reach just 8C in the Midlands and 5C in parts of Scotland.

A
colder-than-average winter with 'significant' snow, -18C temperatures 
and transport disruption is ahead, British Weather Services said this 
week.

Weather Channel 
forecaster Leon Brown said: 'Temperatures above 20C are rare in late 
October - but there’s a 50 per cent chance of 20C in the South on 
Tuesday, close to record levels.'

Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather Outlook said: 'Enjoy the warmth but make sure you’ve got your winter woolies close at hand.

'Forecast
models show a very potent cold blast by October standards, with snow as
far south as Wales - and I wouldn’t rule out snow in the South by next 
weekend.'

WeatherOnline forecaster Simon Keeling said: 'The major story of the next week will be the temperature fall, to 8C in the Midlands and 5C in Scotland by Friday.

'Thursday may see low-level sleet in Scotland with snow on higher ground, with Friday seeing wintry showers on hills in England’s East and North.'

British Weather Services said: 'Could we go from T-shirts to sledges within days?'

Met Office forecaster Dave Britton said: 'Temperatures will be in the high teens at the start of next week and perhaps very warm in the South-East in any sunshine.

'Things cool off later in the week but it’s too early to say if there will be snow.'
