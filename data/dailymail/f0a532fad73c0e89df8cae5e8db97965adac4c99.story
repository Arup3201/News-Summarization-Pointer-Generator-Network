On Tuesday, four-year-old Utah boy, Ethan Van Leuven passed away after his long battle with acute leukemia, but not before his parents and neighbors made sure he had the best week of his tragically short life.

Mom and dad, Merrill and Jennifer were not sure if their brave son would make it through the holiday period, so they decided to cram his birthday, Halloween and Christmas all into the same week.

The celebration ended over the weekend, but the community of West Jordan made sure their bravest resident's last days were filled with laughter and joy.
