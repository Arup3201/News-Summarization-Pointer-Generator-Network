Four veterans who served for years in the U.S. military have been grounded after their names were among those of 13 Americans believed to have been added to the government's no-fly list. 

The group, who have found themselves barred from flying to the U.S., are suing the government over claims that the list denies them the right to due process.

For many, including Raymond Earl Knaeble IV, who converted to Islam after serving in the Army, the first sign they have of being on the list is when they are stopped from boarding flights back to their homes in the U.S.

Denied: Raymond Knaeble, left, and Abe Mashal, right, are included in a lawsuit suing over the no-fly list

Knaeble served in the Army from 1999 to 2003 and, after his honorable discharge, began work for a private company in Kuwait.

He later converted to Islam and joined an anti-war group but, according to his father, Knaeble is a loyal American.

He first discovered he was on the no-fly list in 2010, when he tried to board a flight to Colombia after getting married.

The bar meant that in order to return home to the U.S. he had to travel by bus from Panama, through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico before reaching the U.S. 

His father told Fox News: 'It’s affected him immensely. He can’t travel unless it’s by car or by
 foot. And he has the FBI following his every move, 24/7.'

Knaeble, like the others on the list, has no way of finding out why he has been barred from flights. When he was barred from boarding the plane in Colombia he was told to visit the nearest Embassy, where his passport was taken from him but no answers were given.

The government has refused to confirm or deny if those bringing the case are on the no-fly list.

Solution: District judge Anna Brown says officials need to find a way to let those on the list know why they have been blocked

In 2010, Mr Knaeble, who now lives in Chicago, wrote in a blogpost that he cooperated with officials, handing over his cell phone SIM card and a list of contacts in the Middle East.

He claims that he has been 'interrogated day in and day out by the FBI' despite not being given a reason for why his name is on the list.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing them, said the process used by the FBI's terrorist screening center, is unconstitutional
 because those on the list have no way of knowing what caused them to be
 added, and therefore are not able to contest it.

According to AP, in 2012 the federal no-fly list included about 21,000 people, including 500 Americans.

The 13 Americans bringing the lawsuit over their inclusion on the list have been barred from domestic flights and those flying to and from the U.S. Their names were added between 2009 and 2012.

One of the other veterans suing under the lawsuit is Abe Mashal, who was trying to fly from Chicago to Washington state when he first realized he was on the no-fly list.

The former Marine said the ban has caused him to miss key family events, including weddings and funerals, and said it has led to a loss for his dog-training business.

According to the Huffington Post, he was added to the list after sending emails to a Muslim cleric the FBI was watching, and then refusing to hand over information about fellow Muslims.

Mashal and Knaebie's cases illustrate the personal restrictions being on the no-fly list cause. A federal judge has rejected claims by the Justice Department that the list does not lead to a bar on travel by other means.

In August U.S. District Judge Anna Brown rejected claims that the no-fly list does not deprive citizens of their civil liberties.

She demanded a solution for those on the list to find out why they were added and to be able to maintain their right to due process.

Government lawyers this week however said national security issues limited a person's rights to a hearing about their no-fly status.

They warned Brown against taking over policy making if she rules the current system is unfair.

In August the circuit court of appeals gave Brown responsibility for the lawsuit, which was launched in 2010. The Oregon judge has not said when she expects to make a decision in the case.

Attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, Hina Shamsi, has said the current system denies Americans the right to contest the evidence that led to them being on the no-fly list.

'When
 the government deprives people of those rights, it must provide them 
notice and a meaningful opportunity to clear their names,' Shamsi told Fox News.

Currently, those barred from boarding a flight to the U.S. can try to contest it with the Department of Homeland Security. If they are then unhappy with the department's ruling they can apply for a judicial review bit not a hearing, where evidence against them would be presented.

For Knaeble and the others fighting their inclusion on the no-fly list, the travel limbo has left them in despair.

'I am a veteran of the U.S. armed forces and I have no criminal record. I am no threat to national security and have been charged with no crime,' Knaeble wrote in 2010.

'The FBI put me on a list that turned my life upside-down and there is no process in place to make them tell me why, or let me respond to any accusations they may have against me.'
