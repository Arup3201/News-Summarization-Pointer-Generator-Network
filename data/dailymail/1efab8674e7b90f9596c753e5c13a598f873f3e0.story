David Cameron has taken industry experts by surprise, saying he wants fracking underway by the end of the year

Britain has a duty to step up fracking to reduce dependence on gas from Russia, the Prime Minister said yesterday.

David Cameron, who met world leaders to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, said the annexation of Crimea was a ‘wake up call’ for Europe about its reliance on Russian energy.

Moscow supplies around a third of Europe’s gas, much of it via a pipeline through Ukraine, and Mr Cameron said some countries are nearly 100 per cent reliant on Russian gas.

He said he wanted some shale gas wells up and running by the end of the year, to encourage the idea of self-sufficiency in energy.

But his call surprised industry experts, who said it would be the end of this decade before commercial fracking could begin.

Britain gets most of its gas from the North Sea, Norway and Qatar but will need far more imports as North Sea supplies dwindle.

Officially the UK imports less than 1 per cent of its gas from Russia. But Moscow-owned firm Gazprom claims it could be as high as 15 per cent indirectly, as Britain’s buys gas from other European countries such as Germany at peak times, which originates from Russia.

In 2009, when Russia cut off the gas to Ukraine, UK prices jumped by 17 per cent.

Britain has vast reserves of shale gas trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground which can be extracted in the controversial fracking process.

It got under way in Lancashire three years ago and had to be halted after two small earthquakes but has now re-started.

Exploratory drilling near the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, last year was abandoned after the site was overrun by protesters who believe fracking could ruin the countryside and contaminate water supplies.

Yesterday the Prime Minister said the military action by Russia meant that ‘energy independence’ should become ‘a tier one political issue from now on, rather than tier five’.

Asked whether it was Britain’s duty to secure its energy independence by embracing fracking, he said: ‘Yes, I think it is.’

He added that one of the best ways of addressing ‘people’s uncertainties and worries’ is to show them shale gas wells in action as soon as possible.

‘By the end of this year there should be some unconventional gas wells up and running that we can demonstrate and I think  the enthusiasm for it will grow,’ he said. ‘I’m confident we’ll win the argument.’

Ministers are expected to hand out dozens of licences for shale gas drilling this summer, and a map of Britain’s reserves suggests every county except Cornwall could see some drilling.
