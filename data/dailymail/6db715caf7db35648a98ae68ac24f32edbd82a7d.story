TV watchdogs are under pressure to launch an inquiry into the rip-off cost of watching live Premier League football on television, which can be more than £600 a year.

The pay TV and broadband company Virgin Media claims the way the Premier League sells the rights to top flight matches means armchair fans in the UK are hit with unfair fees.

The net result is that clubs like Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City are sharing in billions of pounds from fans whose passion and loyalty is being abused.

Virgin claims that viewers in the UK are getting a raw deal both on the cost of watching matches and the fact that many games are not broadcast live.

It calculates that the minimum monthly cost of watching live Premier League games on the sports channels of Sky and BT comes in at £51.

That works out at £612 a year, which is more than four times higher than the BBC licence fee of £145.50, which covers all of its many TV and radio channels, including Match of the Day.

The £51 figure is much higher than the £21 month charge football fans in Germany must pay to see top flight teams such as the Bayern Munich and Dortmund in the Bundesliga.

It is also more than double the £25 charged in Italy to watch Serie A, and compares to £18 in Spain to follow Barcelona and Real Madrid and just £10 a month in France.

Access to games in the UK is also far more limited compared to the rest of Europe. Here only 41per cent of Premier League games – 154 out of 380 – are broadcast live in a season. By contrast all games are broadcast live on TV in Spain, Germany, France and Italy.

Research commissioned by Virgin found more than 15per cent of viewers say they could not watch the games they wanted through their TV provider, while 25per cent found that games were not included in their pay TV subscription.

Virgin argues that the way the Premier League packages and sells the TV rights to football in this country works to artificially inflate the price.

As a result, the cost of Premier League domestic live TV rights increased by 70per cent to a staggering £3 billion over three years in the last auction. It is predicted to rise by a further 60per cent when they are sold next time.

The high prices charged by the Premier League means teams in the top flight are able pay world stars like Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Yaya Toure well over £200,000 a week.

It also means there is absolutely no chance of live Premier League games ever returning to free-to-air terrestrial TV channels like the BBC and ITV ever again.

While the sports channel subscriptions are extortionate enough in themselves, BT has been accused of putting up many other charges for all its customers in order to cover the millions of pounds it has paid to the Premier League.

Virgin Media has asked Ofcom to open a formal investigation under the Competition Act 1998 into the arrangements by which the FA Premier League sells live UK television rights to its games.

It claims the current regime causes ‘significant consumer harm’ resulting from escalating rights costs.

The firm’s chief corporate affairs officer, Brigitte Trafford, said: ‘The rapidly rising cost of Premier League live broadcast rights means UK fans pay the highest prices in Europe to watch football on TV. Virgin Media has asked Ofcom to investigate how the rights are sold ahead of the next auction.’

The Premier League insisted the auction process it uses is entirely legal. A spokesman said: ‘Live Premier League audio-visual rights have always been sold in a transparent and open process.

‘Regulators have examined our rights packaging and sales process in considerable detail in the past and found both of them to be compliant with UK and European competition law.

‘If Ofcom chooses to investigate this complaint, we will of course be happy to demonstrate to Ofcom that this is the case.’
