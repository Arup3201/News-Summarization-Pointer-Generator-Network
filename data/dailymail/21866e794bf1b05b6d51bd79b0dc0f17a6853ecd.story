A facebook group dedicated to criticizing 'ugly' babies proves that bullying is not just an act of teenagers.

The private facebook group, which has since been removed, is composed of grown women around the country who grab photos of toddlers from other mothers' facebook pages without approval and post them online for criticizing.

The group was originally designed to trade and sell children's clothing but took a nasty turn.

One mother, Melissa Anetucci, of Palm Beach, Fla. has made it her mission to fight against the self-proclaimed 'mean girls group' and to expose their wildly inappropriate behavior. She began posting the mother's comments online in order to exploit their cruel remarks.

Anetucci told Wesh.com, 'The things that these mothers said were the most horrific things that I have ever seen, being a mom and knowing that they are moms.'

Another mother, Ellen Veach, of Pheonix, Ariz. told Fox News she was terrified to discover that a photo of her 2-year-old daughter was taken from her facebook and pictured next to a cartoon character.

Veach says she didn't realize that friends of friends could access her photos on facebook. It was a friend who notified her her daughter's photo was circulating online.

'So I'm posting pictures of my son's first day in kindergarten or Ivy's new outfit or something just naively posting it up there so my friends can see, not realizing there's a group that takes these pictures and targets these children and makes fun of them. Like that's just something I wouldn't even think a mother or grown woman would do,' Veach told Fox.

One 'mean girl' wrote, 'Before I address this...It...I want to point out that it makes my heart happy that you have a Mean Girls tab in your computer. Good stuff. Now, # 1 is this a he or a she...You absolutely can not fix ugly. This is a God given example of such.'

This Facebook comment was one of the many harsh remarks by the grown-up 'Mean Girls'

The comments go on and on in the private 'toddler bashing' facebook group which has since been deleted

The comments themselves are 'hideous' and most of the mothers in the group have deleted their facebook pages in shame

Another facebook comment read, 'An ugly baby thread. I have died and gone to heaven...why can't you guys live near me so we can do this over cocktails?'

Another commented of a child, 'It's hideous.'

The parents of the children who were being bullied commented on the group's page and asked the women to stop their lewd behavior, but they were none too kind.

'It's hideous,' read the harsh comment under this unassuming child's photo

Angry mothers had some 'words' to say against the mean mothers ridiculing photos of other people's children

One overwhelmed mother wrote, 'This is MY DAUGHTER that is being made fun of because she is delayed…so funny, huh? Sick (expletive).'The photo was of her daughter in the intensive care unit.

One of the 'Mean Girls' responded, 'THIS IS FACEBOOK, NOT THE SALEM WITCH HUNT....THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY AND I WAS LAUGHING BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY....THANKS FOR YOUR COMMENTS, NEXT.'

Some of the 'Mean Girls' acknowledged that what they were saying was unjust. 'I'm probably going to hell for saying that,' one mother said after criticizing a photo of an innocent and unaware child.

'We think out children are beautiful and miracles and have somebody even though you know it's not true to have somebody say something negative or derogatory about your child.. it hurts,' said Veach.

Some of the 'Mean Girls,' many of whom are mothers themselves, defend their behavior by saying that they have a right to free speech.

Most of the mothers in the secret facebook group have deleted their accounts. Veach reported the facebook group and facebook told Fox that they adhere to anti-harassment policies. 

Anetucci says she will not stop going after the 'toddler bashing' ladies group and she makes it her goal to expose their identities.

'We have zero tolerance. You are bullying babies,' she said. 'You're not even bullying your peers. You're bullying babies. No,' said Anetucci.

The facebook page has since been deleted, but the damage caused by the bullying still resonates with many
