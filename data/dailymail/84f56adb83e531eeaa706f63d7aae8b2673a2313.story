Boris Johnson today condemned 'ugly and stupid' metal ‘spikes’ installed at a luxury block of flats to deter the homeless from sleeping there.

The London Mayor joined the online outrage after pictures of the blunt 1.5in studs were posted on Twitter.

Critics described them as ‘inhumane’ and said rough sleepers were being treated like pigeons, who are deterred by spikes on potential perches.

'Spikes': Critics described the studs as 'inhumane' and said rough sleepers were being treated like pigeons

Hundreds of people have signed an internet petition urging to have the 19 studs removed from an alcove next to the entrance of the privately-owned building in Southwark, South London.

Writing on Twitter today, the London Mayor said: 'Spikes outside Southwark housing development to deter rough sleeping are ugly, self defeating & stupid. Developer should remove them ASAP.

'We've spent £34m on the likes of 'no 2nd night out, reaching 3/4s of rough sleepers, but must do more. Spikes are simply not the answer.'  

But some campaigners said that opponents 
were missing the point and argued that the real issue was a shortage of 
help for homeless people with mental health, drug and alcohol problems.

Studs
 and railings have been fitted to the doorways and ledges of buildings 
in Britain to discourage rough sleepers for over a decade.

The latest spikes outside the Southwark block, where a 
two-bedroom flat is worth as much as £900,000, have divided opinion 
among people living in the apartment building.

Residents were not told before they were put in two weeks ago. 

One described them as ‘a form of persecution’, saying: ‘I didn’t 
know what they were at first, I thought they were a design feature.

'When
 I realised I thought it was a strange and brutal idea. It’s like they 
are treating people like animals by putting down the spikes, similar to 
the ones used to deter pigeons.

'I’ve lived in this area for some time 
and there is a lot of homelessness and other problems – these spikes are
 a form of persecution.’

But others welcomed the move, saying that rough sleepers had previously frightened women returning to the block after dark.

Mark Hicks, who has lived in the building for a year, said: ‘I think they’re a very good idea. We used to come back and find drunk homeless people in the doorway, which is not very nice at all. If it stops that, it’s great.’

Another long-time resident, who asked to remain anonymous, added: ‘There is a huge problem with rough sleepers here.

‘I have female friends in the building who are scared to come home at night because they have been intimidated and threatened by homeless people in the doorway. It’s about time something has been done about this.

‘In any case, they aren’t really spikes - they’re not sharp. I’m sure someone could put a blanket over them and sleep here if they wanted to.’

One anonymous blogger, who previously worked with the homeless in London, said the spikes were ‘not a nice thing’ but added: ‘As horrific as it must sound, sometimes you have to remove a person’s sleep site in order to engage that person.’

Homeless charity St Mungo’s Broadway, which has a centre to help rough sleepers get back on their feet near the Southwark flats, said the spikes were a ‘rather brutal’ approach to getting people off the streets.

Chief executive Howard Sinclair added: ‘To undertake such measures without providing the necessary assistance to people who sleep rough is wrong - the aim is to help people move in, not just move on.’

Katharine Sacks-Jones, from homelessness charity Crisis, said: ‘We will never tackle rough sleeping with studs in the pavement.

'Instead we must deal with the causes.’.
