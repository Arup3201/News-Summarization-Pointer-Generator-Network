The woman who caused traffic mayhem during peak hour after falling asleep behind the wheel has admitted to smoking cannabis before getting in the vehicle.

The 37-year-old woman was driving a rented van full of suitcases southbound over the Sydney Harbour Bridge which witnesses say crossed into a northbound lane and crashed into another vehicle on Wednesday morning.

This resulted in a five-vehicle accident on the bridge just after 6.45am, with traffic stretching back for 21km in all different directions to Sydney's city centre after all northbound lanes plus two of the five southbound lanes on the bridge were closed off.

The woman who caused traffic mayhem during peak hour after falling asleep behind the wheel has admitted to smoking cannabis before getting in the car on Wednesday morning

Traffic was at a standstill southbound heading onto Harbour Bridge and into Sydney's centre for 21km

Highway Patrol head Assistant Police Commissioner John Hartley said drugs are becoming a serious issue on the roads across the country.

'It is a scourge on the road as well as society and a major concern,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

'We are increasing the number of random drug tests we do and are looking at new technologies that are more ­efficient to allow us to do even more.'

It has been predicted that the loss of productivity would be as high as $50 million across the city.

Police could not test the woman at the scene due to her injuries but a blood sample was taken after she was transported to the Royal North Shore hospital.

A police officer said charged would not be laid until the test results are determined in the next three to six weeks.

All northbound lanes plus two of the five southbound lanes on the bridge were closed off on the bridge 

A person was stretchered away from the scene by paramedics on Wednesday morning

A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the driver of the Toyota van was a 37-year-old woman.

'She fell asleep at the wheel just before 6.45am,' the spokeswoman said.

All lanes of the bridge have reopened after the multi-vehicle crash.

Emergency crews cleared the accident by 8am but all roads approaching the CBD were affected causing peak-hour chaos for commuters. Motorists were urged to take the ferry or train.

Two people were hurt in the accident and have been taken to hospital, an ambulance spokesman said.  

'Inquiries are continuing after a crash on the Sydney Harbour Bridge this morning,' police said earlier in the day.

'The crash, which involved a number of vehicles, occurred shortly before 6.45am. A number of people are being assessed on site by ambulance paramedics.'

One patient is in a serious condition and has been taken to St Vincent's Hospital, while the other is going to Royal North Shore with minor injuries, an ambulance spokesperson told AAP.
