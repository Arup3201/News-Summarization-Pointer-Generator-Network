Wearing a pink tutu or dressed as a clown, this is Gromit as we've never seen him before.

Seventy life-size statues of the faithful mutt from the Wallace & Gromit series have been auctioned off for charities in the UK and Hong Kong on Friday. 

The unique fiberglass sculptures raised £45,000 for Wallace & Gromit's Grand Appeal at Bristol Children's Hospital in the UK, and Art in Hospital, in Hong Kong.

Manchester-born auctioneer Brian Hodgson said prominent artists, designers and celebrities had been involved in the creation of the the sculptures.

Mr Hodgson said: 'Many of these designs are very special and they either come from some corporates like Mini here have one in the design of Bruce Lee and one of the Gromit's has a ballet dress which has changed his gender somewhat but he is still looking happy.'

The auctioneer said another Gromit which certainly stood out  was specially knitted for the auction by a Hong Kong celebrity couple.

Different shapes: The 70 Gromit's were all different sizes and were designed by artists and  designers

The highest bid was collected for Nick Parks' 'Sweet Dreams' design, which raised £9,500.

Speaking about the appeal of Gromit during the first auction of its kind to take place outside the UK Mr Hodgson said: 'The character resonates with people. 

'He doesn't actually have to say anything but he has his expressions and his character. He is the clever dog and I think people like that, people like the simplicity of Gromit.'

Last year, more than 80 sculptures were auctioned off the appeal and more than £2.3m was raised to fund an expansion of Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.
