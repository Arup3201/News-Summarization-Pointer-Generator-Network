Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the most senior mandarin at the Treasury, has revealed that they will seek to play a 'critical role' in the referendum debate

Treasury mandarins are planning to issue a stark warning
about the economic perils of withdrawing from the European Union.

In a move that has enraged Eurosceptics, officials are set
to publish a formal report in the run up to a referendum arguing that it will
damage Britain’s trade relations if the UK votes to leave in 2017.

Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the most senior mandarin at the
Treasury, has revealed that they will seek to play a ‘critical role’ in the referendum
debate, just as the department has done in the argument over Scottish
independence.

The Treasury produced a report arguing that a Yes vote in
Scotland would damage the economy.

In a speech to the Mile End Group, a politics forum at Queen
Mary, University of London, Sir Nicholas said: ‘Just as the Treasury has played
a leading role in setting out the implications of Scotland leaving the free
trade area that is the United Kingdom, so would I expect it to play a critical
role in setting out the economic implications of the options of staying in or
leaving the EU, should there be a referendum on our membership in the next
Parliament.’

He signalled that the Treasury would argue that Britain
needs to be in the EU to benefit from free trade in the single market and deals
between the EU and other countries.

‘A belief in free trade links seamlessly the Treasury of
William Gladstone to that of George Osborne,’ Sir Nicholas said. ‘The Treasury
has always taken the view that the United Kingdom is a small country with few
natural resources. Its prosperity rests on trade. And the fewer the impediments
there are to trade, the more the economy will grow and the greater the
prosperity of the nation.’

A senior Government source made clear that the Treasury
would argue that Britain must stay in the EU and said Sir Nicholas’s views are
also shared by the Chancellor George Osborne.

Asked if the Treasury will argue for the UK to remain, the
source said: ‘Absolutely. Sir Nicholas is of the view that while there are
aspects of the EU which need to be reformed it would not be in Britain’s long
term economic interests to go it alone. That is a view which is shared by the
Chancellor.’

The Tories have promised to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017 of David Cameron is Prime Minister after the 2015 election

The revelations led Tory MPs to accuse the Treasury of
attempting to scare the public in favour of a ‘yes’ vote.

Leading Eurosceptic Douglas Carswell said: ‘These comments
clearly show that Macpherson and the Treasury are not neutral players in the
debate about Britain’s future in Europe.

‘They are signed up members of the “yes” campaign already. In
some ways it is useful to know – because at least we will know who we are up
against in the referendum.

‘But in a way it is not surprising because it was Whitehall
grandees who took us into this wretched club in the first place.’

Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee,
criticised Sir Nicholas for speaking out.

‘I think it is extremely unwise for officials to make
remarks of this kind on sensitive issues of national importance,’ he said.

The Treasury refused to comment. ‘Sir Nicholas’s comments
speak for themselves,’ a source said.
