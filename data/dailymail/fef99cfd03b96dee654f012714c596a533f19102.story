An escaped inmate has been found in a nearby hot tub after escaping from custody in Los Angeles.

Arturo Valenzuela, 23,  was working outside at Lomita Sheriff's Station when he was given a warning for breaking rules and decided to hop over a wall and run away at around 2.30pm Sunday afternoon.

The inmate, who was arrested for burglary, was found at 5pm hiding in a Jacuzzi about half a mile away from the station.

Valenzuela was wearing a yellow jumpsuit and working outside when he hopped over a wall at the Lomita Sheriff's Station (pictured) after being warned for breaking rules 

The Jacuzzi was covered and only partly filled with water, according to NBC Los Angeles.

Valenzuela was wearing a yellow jumpsuit when he suddenly took off from the station.

'[He] decided he no longer wanted to be incarcerated with us and took off over the west wall," said sheriff's Sgt. Paul Creason told ABC 7.

The search for the escaped inmate included police dogs and a helicopter, though Valenzuela was ultimately found only two streets over from the facility he left.

He injured his ankle during the ordeal and was treated at a local hospital. 

Valenzuela is being held of $100,000 bail for escape charges, in addition to his original burglary charge.

The escaped burglary suspect made it about half a mile from the sheriff's station before police caught him
