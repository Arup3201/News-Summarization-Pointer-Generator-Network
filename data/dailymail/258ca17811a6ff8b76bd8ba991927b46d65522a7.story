Ross Murdoch again beat rival Michael Jamieson in their Commonwealth 100 metre breaststroke heat but it was England's Adam Peaty who thrilled the crowd at Tollcross with a Games record of 59.47 seconds.

The 19-year-old powered to the finish in his heat with fancied Australian Christian Sprenger among the rest of the race left in his wake.
