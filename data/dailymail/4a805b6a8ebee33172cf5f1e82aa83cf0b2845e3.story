They may be newly-crowned La Liga title winners, after defying Barcelona at the Nou Camp, but Atletico Madrid will still go into Saturday’s Champions’ League final as underdogs, in most people’s estimation.

Diego Simeone’s side can consider themselves worthy champions after going behind at the Nou Camp but bouncing back with an equaliser to force the draw they needed to break the Spanish League’s long-running duopoly and finish above Barca and Real Madrid.

But can they round off an unforgettable campaign by getting the better of Real in an eagerly-awaited all-Madrid European final in Lisbon? With Cristiano Ronaldo in the form of his life and Gareth Bale already looking at home in the company of Real’s galacticos, few are backing them to pull off an improbable double.

If they do once more respond to Simeone’s inspirational promptings, in the same way that took them past Chelsea in the semi-final, it will bear comparison with other upsets in the competition’s illustrious history. Here are five of the best.

Liverpool 3-3 AC Milan (aet: Liverpool 3-2 on pens), Istanbul, May 25, 2005 - Liverpool’s players were stunned when they trudged off at half-time, but not as stunned as Milan’s were the best part of two hours later. All bets were off after goals from Paolo Maldini and Hernan Crespo (2) gave Milan a 3-0 interval lead. All except spread bets on the margin of Liverpool’s defeat, that is. But it all changed after a tactical masterclass from Rafa Benitez, who replaced full-back Steve Finnan with midfielder Dietmar Hamman, switched to a 3-5-2 formation and saw the seemingly-impossible begin to unfold. Steven Gerrard, Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso forced extra-time, and Liverpool pulled off the comeback to end them all by holding their nerve in the penalty shoot-out.

Celtic 2-1 Inter Milan, Lisbon, May 25, 1967 – we were still to enter the age of colour television, let alone widescreen and HD, but the grainy images of Jock Stein’s heroic Lisbon Lions defying the odds against Helenio Herrera’s seemingly-impregnable Serie A champions are as vivid as ever. Inter had won the European Cup, as it was known then, in ’64 and ’65 and looked on for a third in four years after Sandro Mazzola converted a seventh-minute penalty, following a Jim Craig foul on Renato Cappellini. The script was made for Inter to sit back and soak up any amount of pressure with their renowned defensive resilience. But Celtic had other ideas, and, after equalising through left-back Tommy Gemmell in the 63rd minute, they became Britain’s first European champions with a close-range finish by Stevie Chalmers six minutes from time.

Marseille 1-0 AC Milan, Munich, May 26, 1993 – under Fabio Capello, Milan were known as The Invincibles and were in the middle of a spell of domestic dominance that brought them three successive Serie A titles. No-one gave Marseille much hope, and a look at the group stages underlined why. While Milan breezed through with a 100 per cent record, Marseille scraped through with three wins and three draws against Rangers, Bruges and an out-of-sorts CSKA Moscow. But defender Basile Boli’s 43rd-minute header proved decisive against a star-studded Milan side containing the likes of Marco Van Basten, Frank Rijkaard, Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta.

Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus, Munich, May 28, 1997 – Juve had just wrapped up their 24th Serie A title under Marcello Lippi and were strong favourites, particularly after beating Manchester United home and away en route to topping their group with five wins and a draw. Dortmund only finished second in their group, to Atletico Madrid, but they unearthed an unlikely hero in the final, in the shape of midfield anchor man Paul Lambert. The Scot may be having his problems as manager of Aston Villa, but he had little difficulty shackling Zinedine Zidane in a man-marking job that proved decisive. He even found time to lay on the opening goal for Karl-Heinz Riedle, who doubled the Germans’ advantage, before Alessandro Del Piero hit back in the second half. An unlikely Dortmund triumph was secured when local lad Lars Ricken scored 16 seconds after going on as substitute.

Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea (aet: Chelsea 4-3 on pens), Munich, May 19, 2012 – the venue gives a clue as to why this counted as an upset. Bayern’s glittering Allianz Arena was the stage, and it was set for Jupp Heynckes’ team to bring the trophy home, two years after the heartbreak of losing to Inter Milan. Add the fact that Chelsea were in turmoil after sacking Andre Villas-Boas two months earlier and finishing sixth in the Barclays Premier League, a distant 25 points behind champions Manchester City, and a Bayern win looked assured. It was all going to plan when Thomas Muller’s downward header reared up off the turf and beat Petr Cech seven minutes from time. But this was to be Didier Drogba’s finest hour in a Chelsea shirt. Just as Bavaria was bracing itself for an all-night party, Drogba powered an 88th-minute header past Manuel Neuer to force extra time that duly gave way to a penalty shoot-out. Incredibly, Bastian Schweinsteiger missed Bayern’s fifth to leave the way clear for Drogba to nervelessly convert the decisive kick.
