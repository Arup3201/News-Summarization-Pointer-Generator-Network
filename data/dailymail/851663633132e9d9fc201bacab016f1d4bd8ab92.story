The drought in California is causing farmland to die, and threatening the water supplies of rural communities, but it's been a godsend for modern gold miners.

Prospectors say the drought is causing a second Gold Rush, since extremely low water levels are opening up areas never mined before.

'A lot of time you would just see a husband. Now you’re seeing the whole family out,' Kevin Hoagland, of the Gold Prospectors Association of America, told KCAL.

Like 1849 all over again: Low water levels in California's historic drought are opening up areas never touched by miners and causing what prospectors are calling a second Gold Rush

Lucky strike: Beginners can expect to find anywhere between $5 and $200 worth of gold in these 'untouched' areas

The first Gold Rush began in 1848 when deposits of the precious metal were discovered in Coloma, California.

That set off a mass migration, with some 300,000 people (forty-niners) from all over the U.S. and world coming to California with the hopes of striking it rich.

In the first five years of the Gold Rush, an estimated 12million ounces of gold were mined - worth more than $16million today - but the rush soon fizzled out.

Get rich quick: More than 300,000 people migrated to California during the Gold Rush of 1849, but the previous metal deposits mostly dried up by 1855

With the current drought, modern prospectors say they're digging in places never touched by the forty-niners.

Hoagland points out several places on Lytle Creek, just 60 miles from Los Angeles, that would have been inaccessible just a few years ago because of swift water.

'I'm 50-some odd years old and I have never had water levels in this area this low,' he said.

Brief: The second Gold Rush may be over as soon as it started though. Rain is expected to his the Los Angeles area this weekend with the heaviest rainfall on Friday morning into the afternoon

More prospectors have been coming out to the creek in recent weeks with pans, slough boxes and metal detectors than is usual for the winter.

Gold is currently selling for $1300 a troy ounce, and Hoagland says beginners can make anywhere between $5 and $200 a day.

But this second Gold Rush may be over as soon as it started.

A storm is set to hit southern California Friday and could last all weekend, with the heaviest rainfall expected Friday morning into the afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.

Today: California's drought continues to worsen, with ten rural communities identified as having fewer than 60 days' supply of water

Parched: Water levels for many of California's 
major reservoirs are well below average and dropping; concern is 
mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought 
of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977

This has local authorities worried about mudslides and traffic accidents with so much rain in such a short period of time.

Since July, Los Angeles has received just 1.2 inches of rain, which means there's been a build-up of oil on the roads that will become slick once wet.

It's also a cause for concern for residents living in hilly areas.

Many residents in Glendora took off work Tuesday just to protect their homes from the expected storm.

Cause for concern: So much rain in a short amount of time has emergency officials fearing mudslides in the area

Glendora City Manager Chris Jeffers told the Los Angeles Times that the storm is a cause for concern, comparing the weather conditions to a similar event in 1968 which led to extremely damaging mudflows.

Despite the dangers, the rain will be celebrated across the state where water supplies have become dangerous low.

Images released by NASA comparing a full Folsom Lake in July 2011 to last month show just how desperate the situation is.

The drought is causing a serious economic consequences for the state since much of the nation's most successful farmland is going to waste because there isn't any water to keep the fields alive.

Before: In 2011, the Californian dam was almost full, sitting at a capacity of 97 percent

After: The capacity of Folsom Lake last month was just 17 percent, a whopping 80 percent lower than what it was 2.5 years ago

California is under the influence of a persistent upper-level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has kept the region generally warm, dry and clear.Nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long, is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched West Coast.The mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore in California, pushing them into Alaska and British Columbia - it is even responsible for rain and cold weather to the East Coast.Similar high-pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters, but they usually break down, allowing rain to get through to California.The duration of its presence - 13 months - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers - it has been named the 'ridiculously resilient ridge.'Source: Sci-Tech Today

Southern California has received just 1.2 inches of rain since July

The drought has caused extremely low water levels in local creeks which is bad for farming but good news for modern prospectors

These prospectors are now able to dig in areas never touched in the original Gold Rush of 1849

But the 'second Gold Rush' may be over as soon as it started with rain forecast for Friday
