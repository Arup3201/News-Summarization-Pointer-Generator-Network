Reputation 
and sentiment will be shoved aside in Cardiff this evening as Saracens’ 
‘Wolf Pack’ set out to hunt down Jonny Wilkinson and Co and deny the 
icon a fitting farewell and claim their own European glory.

The
 script surely dictates that England’s No 10 hero of the ages concludes 
his last appearance on these shores as a champion again, in a Toulon 
team who retain their Heineken Cup title.

But Saracens do not intend to 
yield to this fairytale scenario and in fact they are hell-bent on 
honouring their own departing skipper in appropriate fashion.

Pitch perfect: Jonny Wilkinson took part in Toulon training ahead of their Heineken Cup final vs Saracens

In the zone: Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell practices his place-kicking during their training session on Friday

On
 Friday lunchtime, the Aviva Premiership finalists named Steve Borthwick in the second row, which apparently confirmed his recovery from
 a pectoral injury. Whether or not the former England captain actually 
leads his side on to the Millennium Stadium pitch just before 5pm cannot
 be assured until that hour arrives, but his reassuring presence would 
provide Saracens with a vital boost.

Mark
 McCall’s men will ensure Wilkinson will have to contend with a 
monumental onslaught in this last instalment of the continent’s 
blue-riband event, in its current guise. ‘We are a ferocious team with a
 lot of intensity in our defence,’ said full back Alex Goode.

‘We
 don’t believe in going in in ones or twos; we hunt as a team. We go 
after the opposition and we are relentless in that pursuit of them. 
Whether that means Jonny or whoever, we keep coming and we keep coming.

‘We
 were all pretty young when he won the World Cup with that kick. From 
then on he’s been a hero to a lot of English people, but as far as we’re
 concerned, we want to put as much pressure as possible on him.’

Top dog: Wilkinson scored all of Toulon's points in last season's 24-12 semi-final victory at Twickenham

That is the mindset which underpins the 
Wolf Pack — a term coined by Saracens’ defence coach, Paul Gustard, to 
signify the team’s commitment to hunting in numbers, without let-up. 
Owen Farrell added: ‘The Wolf Pack is what we call our defence. It’s 
called the Wolf Pack because wolves hunt better in packs. It is 
something we have talked about for a long time. The strength of the wolf
 is in the pack. That’s how we operate.’

Under the closed roof, 
Saracens will go big-game, big-name hunting, driven on by the ferocity 
of their Namibian flanker, Jacques Burger, whose thunderous tackling and
 breakdown work inspired the semi-final rout of Clermont Auvergne. He 
and his team-mates will have to reach such stupendous heights again if 
they are to deny a Toulon line-up laden with international glitterati.

The Cote d’Azur club are favourites — 4-6 with Ladbrokes, while Saracens are the 6-5 outsiders.

So
 much attention will focus on the Wilkinson v Farrell contest at No 10; a
 repeat of last year’s semi-final head to head which was comfortably won
 by the veteran and his team.

That game yielded the memorable image 
of Wilkinson consoling his young rival after landing  a quick-reaction 
drop goal. Recalling the incident, Farrell said: ‘We put pressure on him
 for his drop goal and he managed to get it over. I think my words were 
“There’s no way you got that over” because I hadn’t seen it — I couldn’t
 see the posts. He said, “Sorry”. That was it!’

Wilkinson also 
relived the moment when he patted Farrell on the head, adding: ‘It was a
 gesture of respect and I think he understood that perfectly.

‘I 
knew chance would play a big part in that drop goal and the  gesture was
 to show my respect, like in tennis when a shot hits the net and drops 
over the other side. I just wanted to say sorry because that’s what I 
felt.’

Toulon have come to Wales armed with a multitude of  weapons,
 from Bryan Habana to Matt Giteau, Carl Hayman in the scrum, fearsome 
locks in Bakkies Botha and Danie Rossouw, the magnificent Puma captain 
Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe  and exiled England flanker Steffon 
Armitage.

But Wilkinson is the ringmaster and talisman, as his 
coach,  Bernard Laporte, made clear when he said: ‘After we (France) 
lost against England at Twickenham a few years, I said, “We have Zidane 
and they have Wilkinson”. I was right. We are happy to have him.’

The
 fabled fly-half may have played in two World Cup finals and on two 
Lions tours, but in keeping with his emphasis on the here and now, he 
said: ‘Just as with every other game, this game is the  biggest game of 
my career. As far as I am concerned, next week (French Top 14 league 
final) doesn’t exist at the moment and neither does what’s gone before.

‘The
 thought of leaving this final without a happy ending is a painful one, 
so we have to make sure that it doesn’t end like that.’

If Saracens 
have their way, that is exactly how it will end — with the UK leg of 
Wilkinson’s farewell party well and truly spoiled. That’s the vision, 
but despite their  heroics against Clermont it is still difficult to 
envisage.

Toulon have sufficient power and class to give their idol his dream send-off.
