Some might say he probably deserved it - and it's easy to see why.

An angry motorcyclist has been caught on camera in Brazil suffering a humiliating fall after trying to kick a moving car.

In what appears to be a bizarre road rage incident, the biker is seen from a trailing car zooming up behind his target on a road in Sao Paulo before getting alongside and giving it a kick with his left leg.

Having come up behind the car, the biker sticks out a leg to kick the car in an act of road rage

But moments later he loses balance and crashes on the highway.

Antonio Borba uploaded the video to YouTube saying: 'In São Paulo, the car accidentally drifted a little to the right lane.

'The biker started cursing heavily, making a huge fuss on traffic. Not being enough, he stopped the bike and I knew it was coming.

'So I started recording. Here is the result. After that, the car stopped by a police car nearby. The rest I don’t know.'

The man on the motorcycle was not seriously injured.   

But straight after he loses balance and veers off to the right and into the outside lane

Ouch: The motorcyclist tumbles over as his bike goes flying in Sao Paulo, Brazil

Embarassing: The biker, looking like he is in pain, pulls up the left leg of his trousers. He was not seriously hurt in the incident
