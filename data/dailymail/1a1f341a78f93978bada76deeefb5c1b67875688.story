As Hitman: Absolution's release draws ever closer, MailOnline caught up with the game's star, David Bateson - the long-standing voice of Agent 47.

Is it the darkest Hitman game yet?

Bateson: 'You know what, I think they’re all pretty dark. I haven’t seen the whole game, but yes, it’s fair to say that the darkness of it, the element of suspense, fear, death and destruction is the worst...or the best.'

Legend: Agent 47 is one of the most recognisable characters in video games

How has the character evolved since you have played him?

Bateson: 'I think the history and the back story of his creation has been developed more and I think it has also evolved.

'I don’t even know to what extent the creators had worked it through from start to end or whether they’d gone from one game to the next, but I definitely think this game has a much more personal human element to it.

'I thought Blood Money really was pushing it with advancing that human element with his relationship with Diana, however this one takes it to the next level.'

Do you feel like Agent 47 has any weaknesses and are these explored in Absolution?

Bateson: 'Weaknesses, well maybe killing people! You know, I don’t know.

'I’d say his only weakness may be that he might sometimes get a bit curious as to how he goes about killing someone or where that level could lead him to. 

'But then a weakness in this game might be his evolving relationship with one of the characters.'

Looks that kill: Absolution is the most graphically accomplished Hitman yet

Agent 47 has a dry sense of humour. Are there any elements of the character that are similar to you?

Bateson: 'Yeah, a lot, actually. I kill people for a living, I have to admit it (Laughs).

'No, the dry sense of humour right from the get go was there and sometimes I was allowed to put in a bit more, in terms of delivering a line with a bit more irony than originally intended.

'Sometimes it was done as an alternative. I would say, "listen, can I just give him a little bit more of an edge? I think there’s a little twinkle in his eye when he does this line".

'I think his dark sense of humour has actually evolved, too.'

Lastly, what is your favourite Hitman game?

Bateson: 'Silent Assassin, St Petersburg – I love that.'
