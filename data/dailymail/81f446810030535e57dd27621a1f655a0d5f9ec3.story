Retired policeman Ian Richardson (pictured) told a libel trial the Plebgate affair was 'trivial nonsense'

A retired policeman has described the Plebgate affair as ‘trivial nonsense’ which he could not be bothered to record because he was eating his sandwiches.

Ian Richardson told a libel trial yesterday that it was merely a ‘quirky incident’ involving ‘a gentleman on a bike who had the hump’.

The former police marksman was on duty in Downing Street when Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell allegedly called officers ‘f****** plebs’.

He did not hear the former chief whip use the ‘toxic phrase’, but was given an account of what happened moments later by colleague PC Toby Rowland.

 Asked why he did not write a full account of the conversation, Mr Richardson replied: ‘I was eating my sandwiches and I couldn’t be a**** to write too much more – laziness. 

'It was a trivial nonsense incident. It wasn’t a murder scene where tape was being put up.’

Mr Richardson said the confrontation turned into a ‘Mexican stand-off’ after his colleagues refused to allow Mr Mitchell to cycle through the main Downing Street gate.

He told the High Court yesterday: ‘I heard Toby say, “please don’t swear at me sir”. I said, “Hello, I think it’s going off over there”.’

He said his team tried to track down members of the public who allegedly witnessed the incident. When asked why, he said: ‘I was anxious to prove that we had been decent, honourable officers that night.’

Earlier Pc Rowland, the only officer who claims he heard Mr Mitchell use the word ‘pleb’, was accused of inventing his account of the incident. 

The police marksman claims ‘several’ members of the public heard the MP’s outburst and were ‘visibly shocked’.

But James Price QC, representing Mr Mitchell, accused Pc Rowland of inventing his account to justify giving the MP a warning under the Public Order Act.

Mr Price said the officer’s witness statement was ‘a carefully constructed account’.

In a written submission to the court, Mr Price added: ‘Pc Rowland, either on his own, or with the encouragement of others, fabricated the toxic phrases, lied about seeing visibly shocked members of the public, and falsely claimed to have been alarmed by what Mr Mitchell said.

‘In other words, he lied about what was said, where it was said, what he saw and how he felt.’

The Scotland Yard officer, a policeman of 22 years, replied: ‘No, the evidence I have given is the truth.’

Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, over the allegation that, after being refused entry through a Downing Street gate on his bike, he told officers: ‘Best you learn your f****** place. You don’t run this f****** government, you’re f****** plebs.’

Mr Mitchell denies this, but admits saying ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’ after officers refused to open the gate in September 2012. 

News Group Newspapers argues its article was substantially true.

Pc Rowland is suing the MP for suggesting that he made up the allegations. 

The case continues.
