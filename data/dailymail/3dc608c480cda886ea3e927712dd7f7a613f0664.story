The 2014 Winter Olympics is taking place in the Russian city of Sochi – and an investigation suggests that if eavesdropping was one of the events, the Russian security services would be clear favourites for a gold medal.

WiFi and mobile phone coverage at the Games will be the best of any Olympic event, with full broadband access and a 4G network.

But tourists will be spied on to such an extent that the U.S Government has advised them to leave their laptops and mobile phones at home, according to research by journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan.

Russia's secretive FSB intelligence service will use a secret system of phone and internet tapping left over from the Cold War to eavesdrop on visitors and athletes alike.

The SORM surveillance system will 
allow the body to listen in on all 
communications in and out of the Olympic venue at Sochi in February.

The
programme, which stands for System for Operative Investigative 
Activities, was first developed by the KGB in the mid-1980s but was not 
ratified for official government use until 1995. A second programme 
called SORM-2 was developed to monitor online activity in 1998.

It
will allow security services to bug the communications of anyone 
without having to show providers court orders allowing the 
eavesdropping, the analysts said.

Planning: Analysts said the authorities have been installing the surveillance devices in the Black Sea resort of Sochi over the past few years

'Operators
do not know what and when the FSB is monitoring,' Soldatov, who 
collaborated on the project with Citizen Lab, a research centre at the 
University of Toronto and UK-based charity Privacy International, told 
AFP.

The SORM surveillance system will 
allow the FSB intelligence agency to listen in on all 
communications in and out of the Olympic venue at Sochi in February.

The
programme, which stands for System for Operative Investigative 
Activities, was first developed by the KGB in the mid-1980s but was not 
ratified for official government use until 1995.

Three years later, a second programme 
called SORM-2 was developed to monitor online activity.

Under SORM-2 Russian Internet service 
providers (ISPs) must install a special device - at their own considerable expense - on their servers to allow
the FSB to track all credit card transactions, e-mail messages and internet use.

Then in 2000, Russia's Minister of Information Technology and Communications Leonid Reiman issued order 130 that concerned 'the introduction of technical means ensuring investigative activity (SORM) in phone, mobile and wireless communication and radio paging networks'.

The order allowed security services to bug the communications of anyone they liked
without having to show providers court orders allowing them to do so.

Citing research based on 
documents published by the Russian government procurement agency and 
other state records, analysts said the authorities have been installing 
the surveillance devices in the Black Sea resort of Sochi over the past 
few years.

Russia has 
pulled out all the stops to get the subtropic region ready for the 
Games, spending more than $50 billion (37 billion euros) in state and 
corporate money on infrastructure improvements.

Soldatov, after studying an ‘information security concept’ document for the event, told The Telegraph: ‘There is an element of meta-data gathering, but Russian security services are not so interested in meta-data. This is about content.

‘The idea seems to be to make communications in Sochi totally transparent for the Russian authorities.’

It’s thought that the primary reason for this is to help safeguard against terrorist attacks, as Sochi borders the North Caucasus – a hotbed of Islamic extremism. Separatist fighters from that region have been battling Russian forces for years.

The authorities will be monitoring cyber space for words and phrases that could suggest an imminent attack.

However, the level of surveillance 
will be such that the US State Department, according to The Telegraph, 
was moved to tell Americans planning on visiting the Games: ‘It would be
better to forget your laptop or smart phone in your home country, 
because it will be intercepted.’

Meanwhile,
the flame that will burn at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games arrived in 
Moscow on Sunday, starting an epic torch relay around the huge country 
and bringing Vladimir Putin's campaign to stage Russia's first 
post-Soviet Olympics a step closer to completion.

President Putin was to signal the 
start of the torch relay at a ceremony in Red Square 123 days before 
Russia's first-ever Winter Olympics begin in the Black Sea resort city 
of Sochi on Feb. 7.

Protected
by a small lantern, the flame was flown in from Greece after being lit 
at the birthplace of the ancient Olympics and handed over to Russia on 
Saturday at the marble Athens stadium that hosted the first modern Games
in 1896.

Gingerly carrying the lantern, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak stepped off the plane and onto a red carpet as an honour guard of rifle-toting soldiers in wooly Astrakhan collars stood by, chins jutting high.

'Today can truly be called a historic day for us,' Kozak said. 'We - all Russians - have a right to be proud.

The longest torch relay before a Winter Olympics will show off Russia's variety as well as its sheer scale of taking the flame though all 83 regions in a more than 65,000 km (40,400 mile) journey around the world's biggest country.
