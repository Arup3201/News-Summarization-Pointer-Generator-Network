It should be no surprise that Adrian cooly stepped up and slotted West Ham into the fourth round of the FA Cup... the goalkeeper used to play up front.

The Spanish stopper saved Steven Naismith's penalty during a 9-8 penalty shoot-out triumph against Everton after a 2-2 draw at Upton Park, and later proved the hero using a different skill.

And speaking to Sportsmail's Pete Jenson, he admitted that he used to score many goals as a youngster, albeit for an Under 11 team.

‘I was an outfield player before I was a goalkeeper,’ he says. ‘I played up front until I was 10 and I loved to score goals but when my Under 11 team CD Altair lost their goalkeeper and the coach asked: “Who wants to go in goal?”

‘I said I didn’t mind while we looked for a new keeper — 18 years on I’m still in goal!’

Adrian sent fellow Spaniard Joel Robles the wrong way in the final penalty, after the Everton keeper sent his spot-kick rattling against the crossbar.
