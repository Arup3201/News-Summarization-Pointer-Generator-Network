An adorable video of a baby listening to Canadian Rock Band Rush for the first time has emerged online and it’s bound to bring a smile to your face.

Sitting on what appears to be his dad’s lap, the nine-month-old baby looks tiny in a dwarfing pair of adult-sized headphones.

With his eyes wide open in anticipation, the baby named Hector, pulls a frown and begins bobbing his head up and down as the music kicks in.

Becoming – if possible – more wide-eyed, the youngster gets into a bit of a groove and even starts adding some accompanying eyebrow movements to his routine.

While the music itself is silent in the video, the man can be heard laughing along in the background before pointing the camera at the screen and showing the track that the baby is listening to – Rush’s 2112.

Returning to the baby, the video picks up the youngster frowning, yawning and checking out his surroundings while he continues to bob his head.

Dwarfed in a large pair of headphones, the youngster pulls a number of faces as he listens along to the music

Judging by the video, Hector is listening to Rush's 2112 somewhere between ‘The Temples of Syrinx’  and ‘Discovery’ 

Released in 1976, Rush’s 2112 is a 20 minute 34 second song arranged into seven chapters.

Judging by the video, which momentarily shows the computer screen, the baby is listening somewhere between ‘The Temples of Syrinx’ section, which ends quite loudly, and ‘Discovery’, which begins rather more melodically.
