Gareth Bale has posted a picture with Real Madrid's European trophies as the Spanish club set out on their journey to win an eleventh.

Los Blancos clinched La Decima last season, their tenth triumph, after an extra-time victory against rivals Atletico Madrid in the final.

Real start their Champions League campaign with a  match against Basel at the Bernabeu.

Bale is obviously confident for the new season, and while Carlo Ancelotti didn't quite share his optimism, he was also keen to defeat the odds.

'The statistics suggest that we are not favourites as no team have won the Champions League twice in a row,' Ancelotti told Corriere dello Sport.

'But we can repeat last year's success, that would be great. The Decima was a dream for Madrid followers everywhere. The 11th would be the dream of all dreams.'
