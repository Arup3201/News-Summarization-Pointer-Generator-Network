Olivier Giroud believes the French 
national team have come a long way since their turbulent World Cup 
campaign in 2010 and he wants to prove it in Brazil.

France imploded in South Africa four 
years ago, with the players boycotting training after Nicolas Anelka was
 sent home for verbally abusing then-coach Raymond Domenech.

Their
 subsequent failure to reach the knockout stages, finishing bottom of 
their group, led to a rift between the team and the French public.

There were also reports of unrest within the squad following a 2-0 defeat to Sweden in the group stage of Euro 2012, which hardly helped matters.

But
 Giroud has told Arsenal's official website that they have now 
reconciled those differences and have the full support of French fans 
ahead of this year's showpiece.

'I
 am looking forward to the World Cup a lot,' he told Arsenal Player. 'It
 will be amazing in Brazil and a really good opportunity for France to 
bounce back.

'We had a big 
disappointment at the last one but it is part of the past. Now we have a
 really good squad so we have a good chance.

'Yes
 [the fans still talk about the 1998 World Cup] because for the French 
people that will always be a fantastic memory. They're expecting a lot 
from us.

'We have shown 
them that we are better than one or two years ago. We have really 
reconciled with them because of our good results.

'We
 had bad memories from the World Cup and the last Euros, but they are 
behind us and 1998 is the past - you have to look forward. We have the 
support of the French people, so that is a good thing for us.'
