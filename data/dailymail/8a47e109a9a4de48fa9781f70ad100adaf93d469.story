The British Airways Airbus A380 made its debut at the Royal International Air Tattoo yesterday as it took to the skies with the famous Red Arrows above RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire.

British Airways’ senior first officer Peter Nye was at the controls with captain Charles Everett in command of the aircraft.

Hopes are high that Prince Harry will also fly as part of the world's largest military airshow this weekend after he was spotted 'practising' in an Apache helicopter on Friday.

The Prince, who earlier this month

With over 
250+ aircraft participating each year, upwards of 130,000 visitors and 
support from the Royal Air Force and some of the world's leading 
aerospace companies, the Royal International Air Tattoo has been 
acknowledged as not only the world's largest military airshow but also 
one of the UK's premier outdoor events for the whole family.

The first day was on Saturday, with tickets sold out and few remaining for today's events.

As
well as hoping to catch a glimpse of royalty in the skies, crowds were 
be treated to the renowned display of skill and precision of the Red 
Arrows.

The year 2013 is the 49th display season for the Red Arrows in which they will continue to enthrall, captivate and inspire millions of people both in the UK and around the world with a series of displays and flypasts at a wide variety of events.

More recently of note, they displayed their skills at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and last year they formed part of the celebrations for the London 2012 Olympics, and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

Harry’s new qualification is the culmination of three years of training which has seen him learn how to fly the Apache and use its deadly firepower, and conduct missions in Afghanistan.

The assessment comprehensively tested his ability to perform as an aircraft commander across a wide range of tactical and procedural scenarios.
