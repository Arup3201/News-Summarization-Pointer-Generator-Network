Victim: Alim Uddin, 17, was stabbed to death in an alleged row over a second-hand bicycle

A teenager has been stabbed to death in an alleged row over a second-hand bicycle.

Alim Uddin, 17, was attacked while picking up the bike from a boy he knew from school. The pair are said to have argued over payment.

Alim was allegedly dragged up to the top-floor walkway of a block of flats by a gang of youths and stabbed seven times in his arms, legs and chest.

A resident raised the alarm and tried to resuscitate Alim before paramedics arrived. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead with his parents at his bedside.

Alim, who had gained a string of A and B grades at GCSE, was studying for his A-levels in the hope of going to university.

His family said they believed he had been ‘lured’ to his death on the council estate in Brixton, South London, on Sunday.

It is understood that Alim paid a boy £90 for the bicycle last week. However the boy refused to hand it over and demanded £50 more.

The two agreed to meet on Sunday and Alim took two friends with him including Namitullah Hamid, head boy of his school, Chesnut Grove in Balham.

Alim told them to wait for him in a shop but they became concerned when he failed to answer his phone.

The pair found him at 5pm being tended to by paramedics  at the top of the eight-storey tower block.

He was covered in blood and dust.

Alim’s family are originally from Bangladesh and his parents Hakim and Parool, both 40, own an Indian restaurant.

He
 had three younger brothers and a younger sister. His uncle, Absal 
Uddin, 36, said yesterday: ‘He would never come to an estate like this 
normally. We think he was lured here.

‘He’s a posh kid really. He’s always with his family, helping out his dad. You don’t expect this sort of thing to happen.

‘And all over a second-hand bike. It’s such a waste.’

Police have cordoned off Tilford House in Brixton, south London where the fatal stabbing took place

Another
 uncle, Shatab Uddin, 38, said: ‘We are devastated. His parents were in 
pieces when they went to the hospital last night.

‘He’s never had issues with other boys and he doesn’t get involved in drugs. He’s not that kind of boy.

‘Alim
 was very easy-going, and he was very protective of his younger 
siblings. At school he was well liked and had lots of friends. He was 
very sociable.’

Alim had apparently told the other boy’s mother that he had been cheated over the bicycle.

Tragic statistic: Alim Uddin is the third teenager to be killed in London this year

Absal
 Uddin added: ‘We think the reason why he was covered in dust is because
 he was dragged up those flats by a group of people. He wasn’t naive, he
 certainly wouldn’t have gone up there of his own accord.’

Alim’s
 family said he loved computer science and art and wanted to be a 
policeman. His friend Namitullah, 17, said: ‘I was there but I didn’t 
see anything. I don’t want to say any more. He was my friend. I can’t 
bear it.’

A 16-year-old boy
 has been arrested on suspicion of murder and was being questioned by 
detectives from the Metropolitan Police last night.

A
 Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A 17-year-old boy was taken by the 
London Ambulance Service to a South London hospital where life was 
pronounced extinct. We await formal identification. A post-mortem 
examination will be scheduled in due course.

‘The investigation is being led by detectives from the homicide and major crime command.’

Alim
 is the third teenager to be murdered in London this year. Basel 
Aghabra, 19, was fatally stabbed in February and Shereka Fab-Ann Marsh, 
15, was shot in March.
