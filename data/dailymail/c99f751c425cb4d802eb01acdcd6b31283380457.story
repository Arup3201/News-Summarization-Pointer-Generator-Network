The Duke of Edinburgh made a full return to public engagements today - albeit with the help of a stick.

But aides of the doughty 92-year-old were quick to explain it was not a permanent feature.

The Queen’s husband, who has spent the summer recuperating at Balmoral after undergoing abdominal surgery in June, was visiting volunteers restoring a rare bog on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

Back on form: The Duke of Edinburgh returned to his public duties today with a visit to a conservation project at the Dersingham Bog Nature Reserve, on the Royal Sandringham Estate, Norfolk

On the mend: Prince Philip's return to health comes after he spent the summer recuperating at Balmoral after abdominal surgery in June

‘It was the kind of staff used quite frequently by those engaged in countryside pursuits, particularly when walking across uneven terrain,’ said one. ‘It is not something that the Duke uses often.’

Indeed, Philip appeared in fine fettle as he chatted animatedly with the conservationists at Dersingham Bog, a national nature reserve covering more than 400 acres, which is one of the last remaining fragments of lowland heathland in south-east England.

The workers were from The Conservation Volunteers (TCV), a national charity which encourages people and communities to transform their health, prospects and outdoor places by getting involved with projects.

Philip is the organisation’s patron and watched as the volunteers worked at coppicing, rhododendron clearing and restoration work on the mire.

Patron: The Dersingham Bog is a nature reserve covering 400 acres. Prince Philip is the patron of The Conservation Volunteers which is working on preserving the site

After the tour of the reserve Philip presented certificates to volunteers who have been working with TCV on projects in the local area.

From next week the prince, who normally undertakes some 300 plus public visits each year, will once again take up a full programme of engagements.

The ageing royal was admitted to The London Clinic in early June - his fourth hospitalisation in just 18 months - where he underwent what Buckingham Palace described as an ‘exploratory operation following abdominal investigations’.

He was released 10 days later and although staff have refused to discuss the result of the tests citing medical confidentiality, they made clear he would require at least two months recuperation.

After retiring to recover at the Queen’s residences at Windsor Castle and Sandringham, Philip flew up to Scotland where he joined his wife for the summer.

Merit: Prince Philip took a tour of the conservation work before presenting volunteers with a certificate
