West Ham have announced the signing of Pachuca striker Enner Valencia on a five-year contract, with the Ecuador international awaiting a work permit to complete the deal.

Valencia, 24, scored all three of Ecuador's goals in the 2014 World Cup, attracting attention from throughout Europe as a result.

But it is West Ham who have won the race 
for his signature, with the Hammers announcing the signing on Thursday 
morning ahead of their pre-season tour of New Zealand.

'West Ham United are delighted to announce that exciting Ecuador international forward Enner Valencia will become the Club's fifth summer signing, subject to a successful work permit hearing,' a statement on their official website read.

'Valencia, who impressed hugely in scoring three goals for his country at the FIFA World Cup finals in Brazil, will join West Ham on a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee.'

Although the fee will not be disclosed it is believed that Valencia, who started his career with Emelec before moving to Mexican outfit Pachuca, moves to West Ham for a deal close to the club-record amount paid for fellow striker Andy Carroll last summer.

After completing his move from 
Liverpool Carroll struggled for fitness last season and goalscoring was a
 problem for Sam Allardyce's side.

With
 Valencia, who also scored in Ecuador's World Cup warm-up draw with 
England, now on board Allardyce will be hoping the Hammers' reliance on 
Carroll will be eased.

The
 59-year-old was only assured of his position in May but has now brought
 in five new faces as he looks to improve on last season's 13th-placed 
finish.

Once the work 
permit regulations are dealt with, Valencia will join fellow striker 
Mauro Zarate, Senegal midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate, full-back Aaron 
Cresswell and England youth international Diego Poyet in completing 
moves to Upton Park so far this summer.
