As the former Foreign Secretary he was used to meeting and negotiating with political leaders from around the world.

But William Hague found himself with an even trickier engagement when he bumped into a hen party at a sausage and beer festival.

Thankfully, as this picture shows, Mr Hague emerged smiling - despite showing some confusion about the L-plate symbols worn by the hens.

Former Foreign Secretary found himself with a tricky engagement when he bumped into a hen party at a sausage and beer festival in Bedale, Yorkshire - but appeared to fit in well

Mr Hague, who in recent months has been seen campaigning with the movie star Angelina Jolie, was presenting awards at the Camp Hill Sausage & Beer Festival in Bedale, Yorkshire, on Saturday when the unusual meeting took place.

The hen party, who were celebrating with bride-to-be Rhiannan Adamson, were glamping in the area when they approached the unsuspecting Tory politician for a photograph.

Afterwards some of her Facebook friends joked about him being mistaken him for a stripper. 

Victoria Whiteley, a member of the hen party, said: 'We were just sat on the grass at the place we were staying and we heard that there was this sausage and beer festival and then the next thing, William Hague is there presenting awards.

'He was very nice. He was asking questions about the wedding and things and complimented us on the flowers in our hair.'

Ms Whiteley revealed that Mr Hague was not aware of the reasons for the L-plates sported by the hen party and needed an explanation.

'It was funny because we had to explain why we had the L-plates on. He didn't understand it,' she added.

It's been suggested that the tradition for L-plates arose because soon-to-be-hitched virgin brides would have to learn their way around the bedroom pretty quickly if they planned to keep their new husband.

But a more popular line of reasoning is that a bride-to-be is, by definition, not married yet, making her a bit of a 'learner' as far as marriage is concerned - just like a inexperienced driver who's yet to pass their driving test.

Mr Hague quit as Foreign Secretary and became Leader of the Commons in a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month.

He will leave Parliament at the 2015 general election after 26 years as MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire.

After the announcement, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'William Hague has been one of the leading lights of the Conservative Party for a generation, leading the party and serving in two cabinets.

'Not only has he been a first-class foreign secretary - he has also been a close confidant, a wise counsellor and a great friend.

'He will remain as first secretary of state and my de facto political deputy in the run up to the election - and it is great to know that he will be a core part of the team working to ensure an outright Conservative victory.'
