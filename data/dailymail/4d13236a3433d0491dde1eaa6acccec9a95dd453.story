England stormed into their fourth successive Women’s World Cup final on Wednesday night as a devastating scrum onslaught and a superb all-round performance by goal-kicking centre Emily Scarratt quelled spirited Irish resistance.

Gary Street’s team fell behind to an early Ireland try at Stade Jean Bouin in Paris, but once the pack had established a formidable set-piece platform the result became a glaring formality. They were in front from the 33rd minute and went on to touch down five times.

What began as a compelling contest turned into a rout as the Red Rose forwards — led by veteran props Rochelle ‘Rocky’ Clark and Sophie Hemming — blasted their opponents into set-piece oblivion. The scale of their dominance was astounding, while initial lineout problems were gradually overcome and the back row were ferociously combative.

Yet, the victors produced ample creativity to go with their clout and commitment. In their pool-stage draw with Canada there was no real cutting edge but this semi-final was illuminated by the footwork of full back Danielle Waterman and pace out wide from Kat Merchant and Kay Wilson.

In midfield, Scarratt spread constant mayhem; carving through the opposition repeatedly and kicking 11 points.

This had all the makings of a close encounter. Ireland had stunned champions New Zealand to send the previously imperious Black Ferns crashing out of the tournament, but they were unable to hit such heights again, while England rose to the occasion in fine style.

Despite Maggie Alphonsi’s typically relentlessly defensive efforts, the Irish went over from a lineout drive in the 16th minute to take the lead, but their advantage was short-lived.

Try No 1 for England saw Clark plunge over from close range to level proceedings. The first of Scarratt’s two penalties put her side in front, then the No 13 created the next try with a long-range break down the left. The ball was shipped across to the far side and Merchant claimed her 44th try in her 57th appearance for England.

After the break, the procession went on as the scrum mis-match continued. England captain Katy McLean shunned the option of a shot at goal from a 57th minute penalty and made the decision pay off with the decisive pass to send Wilson hurtling in at the left corner.a

With 19 points between the teams, the game was up, but the runners-up from the last World Cup were in no mood to ease up. Galvanised by their replacements, England struck twice more, with both tries coming from Wasps flanker Marlie Packer.

She burst through a crowd of defenders and stretched over for her first, before pouncing on Rachael Burford’s deft kick through for her second.

When the one-way traffic finally stopped, McLean said: ‘We knew Ireland would be very tough but the result reflects our performance. We showed that when we get it right, we can cause teams a lot of problems.’

If they can reach the same standards again in Sunday’s final, the title they have long craved will be theirs for the taking.
