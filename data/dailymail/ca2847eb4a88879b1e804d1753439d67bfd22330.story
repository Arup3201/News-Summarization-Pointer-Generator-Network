On the run: Charles Rodriguez fled the UK after robbing a diamond trader in in Manchester but police monitored his Facebook and phone use

Police caught a thief, who stole more than £80,000 worth of diamonds and pearls, after he posted holiday photos on Facebook while on the run.

Charles Rodriguez, 31, fled the UK after robbing a diamond trader in ‘an appalling attack’ in Manchester in October 2011.

But police caught up with him after he brazenly posted holiday snaps of himself enjoying the sights of London and Rio de Janeiro on his Facebook page.

He was jailed for five years and four months at Manchester Crown Court today after pleading guilty to robbery at an earlier hearing.

Rodriguez, who is thought to be a member of the London-based South American organised crime group The Latin Kings, threw the trader to the floor with another male during the robbery.

They stole the keys to his car and opened his boot during the attack on Singleton Road in Broughton Park, Salford, making off with two briefcases containing diamonds and pearls worth more than £80,000.

Detectives in the Salford Volume Crime Team trawled hours of CCTV footage and identified the culprits who were following the trader on the day of the robbery.

They followed them from Manchester city centre back to Salford on October 12, 2011, the day of the attack.

After an analysis of his social networking use and analysis of telecommunications evidence, officers discovered he had fled the UK and returned to Columbia about a month after the robbery.

He then posted his holiday snaps including one showing him draped in a Rio de Janeiro flag on what appears to be a tourist boat.

He had purchased two tickets for a TAM airlines flight to Rio de Janeiro on November 10, 2011 and left using a false passport in the name of ‘Mr Chiguichon-Lopez’.

Detectives discovered Rodriguez had returned home to Columbia after his holiday in Brazil, but they were unable to arrest him as Columbia is a non-extradition country.

But Rodriguez slipped up on December 4
last year when he was stopped by police for suspicious driving in 
London after coming into the country on another false passport.

He provided officers with a false name, but his true identity was revealed with fingerprints and he was arrested and charged.

Before his arrest, he had posted more pictures of himself on Facebook of him Christmas shopping and taking in the sights of the capital.

Detective Sergeant Roger Smethurst said: ‘Rodriguez’s arrogance was astonishing.

‘After committing an appalling attack
on a jewellery trader, he fled the country to his native Columbia where
he knew he could not be extradited. 

‘However,
his lack of remorse was evident by the fact he brazenly posted 
sightseeing pictures from Brazil - at a time when he was on the run - on
his Facebook page.’

‘But 
patience is a virtue and while Rodriguez thought he was living a 
carefree, jet set lifestyle, our officers were gathering overwhelming 
evidence against him so that when he finally did slip up, there was no 
escape.

‘I would like to 
commend all those who worked on what was a complex and lengthy 
investigation, and just as importantly hope that this brings some sense 
of closure to the victim who has had to wait months and months to see 
his attacker brought to justice.’
