The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have secretly set up firms to protect their ‘brand’ and intellectual property rights.

In a move more often associated with celebrities such as David and Victoria Beckham, they have told lawyers to establish companies in each of their names.

It will enable William and Kate to sell officially-endorsed products and take action against anyone selling items that could harm their image.

Kate’s firm is called CE Strathearn – from her names Catherine and Elizabeth and the Countess of Strathearn title awarded by the Queen.

William’s is APL Anglesey – after his middle names Arthur Philip Louis and the Welsh island where he and Kate lived after they married.

Prince Harry has taken the step too, calling his company Tsessebe – the name of an African antelope.

Kensington Palace stressed last night the firms would not be ‘regular trading arms’ and were likely to remain dormant for the foreseeable future.

But aides admitted they could not rule out them being used for commercial purposes at some stage, with the profits going to charity.

They also confirmed the companies could be used for ‘protection’ when it came to the issue of trademarks or the couple’s brand.

William and Kate’s solicitors, Harbottle and Lewis, have a team of experts in the field of image rights, including the couple’s legal adviser, Gerard Tyrell.

He has also acted for David and Victoria Beckham, the diver Tom Daley and supermodel Kate Moss. On its website, the law firm boasts: ‘If your brand has value, image rights will form an essential part of your earning potential.

‘We can advise you on how to make the most out of your personal brand, securing intellectual property rights for names, artwork and logos as well as arranging endorsements and sponsorships.’

It helps advise on the ‘exploitation of your image/brand on traditional advertising platforms and various forms of new media’.

In an interview published some years ago, Mr Tyrell gave his views of how image rights may be ruthlessly enforced in sport: ‘If you can control the copyright on a significant amount of stuff – images and the like – the idea is that you strangle everyone else at birth and make sure than anyone who wants a bit of the player comes to you.’

The Cambridges are among the most marketable couples in the world and the use of their name to official endorse a product would be worth millions.

John Noble, of the British Brands Group, a trade body that represents brand owners in the UK, said last night: ‘Forming companies to register and hold your intellectual property rights can be both defensive but also create huge opportunities for raising significant sums in the future for charity.

‘It will also benefit consumers in knowing that they are getting the genuine article.’

According to Paul Walsh, of law firm Bristows, intellectual property concerns the protection of creative ideas, image rights and reputation.

Creating their own companies will allow William and Kate to bring out, should they ever chose to, myriad items of officially-endorsed merchandise from tea towels to coffee cups.

Mr Walsh said: ‘It also means that if something is produced that they feel is very detrimental to their image that they could take action against the maker if they wished.’

It is unlikely, however, to put a stop to royal ‘tat’ – flags, ornaments and the like – traders hawk for royal births or marriages.

‘When products are clearly memorabilia – tea towels, mugs, ornaments and the like – there is little that can be done to prevent this and the Royal Family have never tried to prevent this sort of patriotic thing in the past,’ said Mr Walsh. ‘Nobody will think the product is official or endorsed by the Royal Family. It is clear that the relevant royals are not endorsing the product nor, unlike other celebrities, are they in the endorsement business.’

The memorial fund set up in the memory of William’s mother caused a scandal when it authorised the use of Diana’s signature on tubs of margarine. Trustees also went to court to stop the manufacture of Diana dolls, a battle they lost at a cost of almost £15million.

The three royal firms were set up in October 2012, around the time the Cambridges found out they were expecting their first child.

Royals including the Queen and Prince Charles already have their own official ranges of merchandise.

The profits from the prince’s range, Highgrove, go to charity while Buckingham Palace’s funds the Royal Collection, art and antiques held in trust on behalf of the nation.

Charles offers an eclectic mix of goods ranging from a £70 antler walking stick, to a £2,750 cow willow sculpture and an £18 garden bird mug.

The Royal Collection shop offers a £90 crystal drop tiara, a £12.95 God Save The Queen tea cosy and even an £8.95 palace corkscrew.

There were registered at Companies House under the holding name of Tyrolese with their registered address as Clarence House, Prince Charles’s official London residence. But according to sources, the names were changed in May to ‘mean something to them’.

The directors of Kate’s company are her private secretary, Rebecca Deacon, and a member of Clarence House staff, Polly McGivern, who is also a director for William and Harry.

William has appointed his private secretary, Miguel Head, as a director of APL Anglesey while Harry has chosen his principal private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton.

Kensington Palace officials said they were doing the ‘sensible thing’ in protecting the couple’s rights. They insisted CE Strathearn and APL Anglesey will be used on special occasions only and any money raised would go to charity.

‘It is not intended to alter the normal modus operandi of the Duke and Duchess’s operation. Raising funds by working closely with charities etc will continue as normal,’ said a source. ‘But setting up these companies is a sensible precaution and is a pre-emptive move – not a change of working.

‘They are not a trading arm – more about creating a vehicle that could be used in future for specific situations. It is not necessarily about making money – it could be about protection such as the issue of trademarks for example.’

Both William and Kate approved the setting up of the companies, they said.

A spokesman added: ‘APL Anglesey and CE Strathearn have been set up to house the intellectual property rights of the Duke and Duchess. They were formed a year ago, but remain dormant. They are not intended to be used as a regular trading arm.’
