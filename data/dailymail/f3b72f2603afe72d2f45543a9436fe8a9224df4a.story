Ancient Britons had far less gum disease during Roman occupation than people today. Evidence of the disease on ancient skulls is pictured

Ancient Britons had far less gum disease during Roman occupation, 1,800 years ago, than people today - even though there was little dental care, experts claim.

Just five per cent of 300 skulls examined, which date between 200AD to 400AD, showed signs of severe periodontitis, or gum disease, which affects three in 10 people today.

Experts believe that modern habits such as smoking are responsible for the decline in the nation’s gum health.

Professor Francis Hughes, of King’s College London, said: ‘We were very struck by the finding severe gum disease appeared to be much less common in the Roman-British population than in modern humans - despite the fact that they did not use toothbrushes or visit dentists as we do today.

‘Gum disease has been found in our ancestors including in mummified remains in Egypt - and was alluded to in writings by the Babylonians, Assyrians and Sumerians as well as the early Chinese.’

Gum disease is the result of a chronic inflammatory response to the build-up of dental plaque.

Much of the population lives with a mild form but factors such as smoking or medical conditions like diabetes can trigger more severe chronic gum disease, which can lead to the loss of teeth.

Professor Hughes said: ‘One of the main reasons for doing the study was the realisation in recent years that a lot of periodontal disease was associated with smoking and to a lesser extent diabetes, and although oral hygiene is obviously important it wasn’t the only factor that contributed to destructive periodontal disease.

‘This study was a way of looking at the reverse of modern causative factors - poor oral hygiene but less other contributory factors such as smoking and diabetes.’

The research, published in the British Dental Journal, examined 303 skulls from a Romano-British burial ground in Poundbury in Dorset for evidence of dental disease.

While instances of gum disease in the Romano-British skulls was low, many of them showed signs of infections and abscesses - and half had tooth decay.

The ancient population also showed extensive tooth wear from a young age, caused by a diet rich in coarse grains and cereals.

‘Some tooth decay was seen in many of the population - the main difference of this to modern populations was that this was typically confide to one or 2 teeth, whereas it is more widespread in the mouth today,’ Professor Hughes said.

‘Quite a lot of infection also arose because of the severe tooth wear resulted on occasions in exposure of the dental pulp - the dental nerve inside the tooth - and this would be a very predictable way of getting chronic infections’

The Poundbury cemetery community was made up of countryside dwellers as well as a Romanised urban population. This was a non-smoking population and likely to have had very low levels of diabetes.

Among the people who survived infancy, childhood illnesses and malnutrition into adulthood, the average age seems to be 40, with infectious diseases believed to have been the reason for death.

Theya Molleson, of the Natural History Museum, said: ‘This study shows a major deterioration in oral health between Roman times and modern England.

‘By underlining the probable role of smoking - especially in determining the susceptibility to progressive periodontitis - in modern populations there is a real sign that the disease can be avoided.

‘As smoking declines in the population we should see a decline in the prevalence of the disease.’
