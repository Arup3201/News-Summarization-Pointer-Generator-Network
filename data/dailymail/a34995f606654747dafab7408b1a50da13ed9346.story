Princess Charlene and Prince Albert II of Monaco wore matching navy blazers as they attended the final of the Monte Carlo Masters yesterday.

The his 'n' hers jackets with gold buttons were not a fashion conscious attempt to sync their wardrobes but are their official Monte Carlo Sporting Club uniforms.

The sporty royals were on hand to watch the tennis as Novak Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal to the title in two sets, 6-2, 7-6.

Rain delayed the start of play on centre court for almost an hour but the sun soon came out to bask the players and spectators in Mediterranean heat.

The royals, who tied the knot in 2011, were seen boisterously cheering and clapping during the match proving their presence was more a pleasure than a duty.

Afterwards they presented the trophies to the tennis stars where the princess gave Serbian Djokovic a congratulatory hug.

Earlier in the day, Prince Albert indulged in a spot of tennis himself as he took part in an exhibition match with former professional players Guy Forget and Arnaud Boetsch and French TV presenter Patrick Poivre d'Arvor.

But while the 55-year-old had looked trim in his navy blazer, his tennis whites revealed he's no longer in the shape he was in as an Olympian.

Competitive: The royal proved his agility as he served and moved around the court to return shots

A slight belly could be seen over-hanging his shorts as he took part in the match on the clay courts.

The prince competed in the bobsleigh in the Winter Olympics five times and remains a keen supporter of the Olympic movement. Meanwhile his glamorous wife, 35, is also a former swimming Olympian for South Africa.

But while the prince may have gained a couple of pounds since his Olympic glory days, he doesn't seem to have lost any of his agility, moving around the court and returning shots with ease.

However, he couldn't match up to the blistering tennis seen later in the day between Djokovic and Nadal. Djokovic ended Nadal's eight year reign as the champion of Monte Carlo as the injury-hit Spaniard continues his return to form.

'I knew after yesterday's match that I had a feeling that I had a big chance to win against Rafa if I was on the top of my game,' Djokovic said. 'The first six, seven games, eight games, were unbelievable. It's the best that I can play on clay.'

He added: 'I did not know if I was going to be a part of the tournament this year. I made a decision to play, right now, it's the best decision of my life.'
