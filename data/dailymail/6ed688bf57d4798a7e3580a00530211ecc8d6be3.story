Most people would send valuable items by recorded delivery at the very least.

While anyone posting  a rare piece of art worth thousands of pounds by one of the world's greatest painters would almost certainly go to great lengths for it to be protected.

But one Norwegian museum's attempt to save money has come back to haunt them after the had a Rembrandt etching sent in the post - only for it to get lost.

The Soli Brug Gallery in Greaaker, about 50 miles south of Oslo, bought from a British dealer a copy of Rembrandt's 'Lieven Willemsz, van Coppenol, Writing-Master' for an exhibition.

They wanted to save money on courier and insurance costs of it coming from the UK - and chose for it to be delivered in the post.

But everything did not go to plan. And as days past by without the work arriving through the letter box it became clear that the virtually irreplaceable had been lost.

'Using a courier or special insurance is quite expensive so we have used regular mail until now,' Ole Derje, the gallery's chairman said.

'It is worth around 40,000 to 50,000 crowns ($6,900-$8,600) and the postal service is offering us compensation of 500-1,000 crowns.'

Derje said his gallery, which is displaying works by Dürer, Rembrandt, Goya, Munch and Dali, received notice to pick up the package but when he went to collect it, it was nowhere to be found.

Derje declined to name the seller, citing confidentiality concerns.

The Soli Brug Gallery in Greaaker near Oslo, that refused to pay for couriers for the rare Rembrandt is bought from Britain. It was then lost in the post

'We are sorry that this has happened; 
we have advised him to use a more appropriate form of mail when sending 
items that are worth as much as this with the appropriate insurance 
connected,' said Hilde

Rembrandt was a dutch painter and etcher who is considered to be one of the greatest painters in European art.

His works include the The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, 1633, and The Abduction of Europa, 1632.

The Dutch artists Night Watch is valued at a staggering $305,000,000. While in 2009, his 'Portrait of a Man' sold for $36m at Christies in London.

If the lost etching was stolen in the 
post, it will join a register of missing pieces of work that stands at 
an incredible £1bn, according according to the Art Loss Register.

The organisation claims that there are 350,000 stolen works of art in the world.

It is not clear what would happen to the picture if somebody found it in the post but it would be hard for them to sell it legally without attracting the attention of the authorities.

A model stands by Rembrandt's portrait of an unknown man, painted in 1658, hangs in Christie's auction house where it was priced at £25m

Value: A Christie's employee displays Rembrandt's 'A man in a gorget and cap' in 2010 before it sold for £8.5m

Experts say such works often 'go underground' where they trade for just five to 10 per cent of their true value.

Johannes Vermeer's The Concert - valued at $500m is thought to be the most highly valued stolen work of art in the world.

Vincent van Gogh's Poppy Flowers has still not surfaced since it was stolen from the Mahmoud Khalil Museum in Cairo, Egypt, in 2010. It is valued at $55m.
