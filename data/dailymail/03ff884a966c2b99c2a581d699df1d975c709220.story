Four firefighters in a Chicago suburb have been relieved of their duties for refusing to remove American flags from their lockers and helmets.

The four were disciplined after they refused to comply with an order issued last week by Maywood Fire Chief Craig Bronaugh.

He claims that there is a culture of racism in the department and issued a strict memo saying all decals and stickers, including American flags and military stickers, should be removed from lockers and helmets.

The firefighters, including an African American, a Cuban and two white men, deny the chief's allegations of racism in the department

'As a fire chief here, I cannot afford nor tolerate,' he told WGN. He cites a picture of a monkey smoking a cigarette that he found taped on a locker as evidence of the racist culture. 

However the firefighters - who include an African American, a Cuban and two white men - deny the chief's allegations.

They claim the offending image was put up ten years old as a joke about someone who was a heavy smoker. 

They say the tension started when the chief ordering an American flag be removed from the inside of the fire station. The firefighters had bought the flag with their own money to replace an old and tattered one.

They put American flags on their lockers after they were told they couldn't have the flag, but then received the memo saying that stickers weren't allowed. 

When union president David Flowers Jr. refused to take down a Marine decal from his locker he was relieved of duty and sent home.

The locker had previously belonged to his father, who as well as being a Maywood firefighter had served in Vietnam.

'If someone has a problem with a Marine Corp decal, you take this to heart. Flag is attached to our uniform," Flowers Jr said.

The chief says he has nothing against the American flag or veterans. He points out that the station has a flag outside and it also appears on the firefighters uniform.

Bronaugh told WGN that he just wanted to make a blanket rule that covers everything, but the firefighters say the American flag is special and should be exempt.  

Bronaugh denies that he has anything against the American flag and pointed out that it flies outside the station and it on the firefighters uniform
