A gang of nine yobs who beat an autistic teenager, punching her about 20 times in the face and forcing her to take 10 months off school to recover, have escaped punishment.

Sophie Russell, 16, was attacked by the teenage yobs who left her seriously injured with a broken nose and shattered face at her school in February. 

But the gang of four girls and five boys were let off after police only handed one of the mob with a caution. 

Beaten: Sophie Russell was attacked by the teenage yobs who left her seriously injured with a broken nose and shattered face at her school in February

The teenager from Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, had to have facial surgery and was forced to take 10 months off school to overcome traumatic panic attacks and rebuild her life. 

Her mother Helen, who owns a heating ventilation company with husband Iain, 45, in Louth, Lincolnshire, has criticised police for not prosecuting the youths, saying ‘there has been no justice.’

Sophie, who has Asperger’s syndrome, said: 'What I went through was really traumatic and ripped the family 
to bits. I was just walking to my boyfriend’s house and wasn’t expecting
to be attacked.

'I had to jump over a wall to get away from them, then I called my Dad and he came and took me straight to hospital.'

Mrs Russell, 45, said: 'I am absolutely devastated. If they are doing that at the age of 15 what are they going to be doing at the age of 25?

'There is no justice. They have got away unpunished, but it will always be at the back of Sophie’s mind. That is terrible.

Sophie, pictured this month, has only just been able to return to school 10 months on and regained the confidence to relive the horror of the attack

'I still can’t look at the pictures. It’s like somebody ripped my heart out and threw it away.

'To think someone could do that to another person is horrific. She is scarred for life. It will be seen on wedding photos.

'It tore her world apart, she was so upset and couldn’t sleep but she’s really turned her life around.'

She continued: 'At my age there would be somewhere these kids would be sent - stick them in the army I say.

'Because
they are juveniles they have got away with it. If the main offender 
does it again she will end up in front of a judge, but why give them a 
chance to do it again?'

In the moments after the attack, 
Sophie managed to hide behind a wall and call her father, who rushed to 
help her and took her to hospital.

She was discharged that evening but found out four weeks later her nose was in fact broken and had to have surgery.

Despite
suffering serious internal bruising, post traumatic stress disorder and
being left with a permanent scar on her top lip and jaw, the aspiring 
RAF servicewoman has put the attack behind her.

The attack happened at her school in Louth at 5.30pm in February. 

She
has since moved to a new school in Lincoln and despite missing most of 
year ten is on track to take her GCSEs at the same time as everyone 
else.

She has now been chosen by the Olympic Games committee to be a 2012 torch bearer.

Sophie added: 'I want to show everyone they can turn their life around no matter what has happened to them.

'I was on a downward slope but managed to turn things around. I still can’t go to Louth but I’m doing so much better than I thought I could ever be.

'This is the happiest I’ve been since the attack, I couldn’t believe it when my mum phoned me to tell me I’d been selected. I’m really excited, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity.'

A Lincolnshire Police spokesman said the case was passed to the Youth Offending Team who decided not to press charges but to give a caution for common assault.

She said: 'Age is a factor in the decision but everything would have been taken into account. Her (Sophie) injuries would form part of the evidence.

'The case would have been handed over the the Youth Offending Team and various other agencies.

'Evidence would have been looked at to come to the decision that a caution was the necessary action to take in this case.'
