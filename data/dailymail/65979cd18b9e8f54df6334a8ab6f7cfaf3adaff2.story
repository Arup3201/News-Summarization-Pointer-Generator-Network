This bronze statue put up in memory of murdered Sarah Payne was stolen this morning from Burhill County Primary School in Hersham, Surrey 

A bronze statue erected in memory of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne was stolen from her school this morning. 

The 2ft tall statue was presented to Burhill County Primary School in Hersham, Surrey, to commemorate Sarah, who was murdered by Roy Whiting in 2000.  

Three people are believed to have been involved in the 'reprehensible' theft, with a van spotted leaving the area at around 1am.  

Her mother, Sara, said today: 'I implore the public to help me and the police bring my Sarah's memorial statue back where it belongs.' 

She fears the statue could end up at a scrapyard and melted down and appealed for such businesses to look out for it.

She said: 'Monetary-wise it's not worth that much. It's worth far more to the school. The residents feel sick and I feel sick about it.' 

Eight-year-old Sarah was abducted by paedophile Roy Whiting as she played with older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte  in a field outside her grandparents' rural home in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex in July 2000. 

Michael Payne and his then wife Sara made a series of heart-rending appeals for her safe return, but her body was discovered 16 days later in a shallow grave just a few miles away. 

Whiting was sentenced to life behind bars in January 2001, and is held at HMP Wakefield, dubbed the Monster Mansion due to the number of high risk sex offenders imprisoned there. 

Her mother, Sara, said today: 'I implore the the public to help me and the police bring my Sarah's memorial statue back where it belongs'

It later emerged that Whiting was already on the Sex Offenders Register after abducting and sexually attacking another eight-year-old.  

Her brutal death remains one of Britain's highest profile child murders and led to the introduction of Sarah's Law following a lengthy campaign by her mother.

The rule allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. 

Sarah's father, Michael, died aged 45 last October after a long battle with alcoholism.

Her mother was awarded an MBE in 2008 for her campaign work. 

Following the theft of the statue today, Elmbridge neighbourhood sergeant Marc Nettleingham said: 'We are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the offenders responsible for this theft, which is particularly reprehensible given that it was presented to the school in memory of Sarah Payne.

'I am appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area at the time of the offence, or with any other information, to come forward straight away.'
