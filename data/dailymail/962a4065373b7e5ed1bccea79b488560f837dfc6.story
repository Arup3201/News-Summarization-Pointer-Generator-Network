A hotel worker whose  nose was bitten off on the night of his work Christmas party is having it rebuilt using skin from his face.

Christopher Watson, 32, admits he was too drunk to remember on a night out with colleagues in Newcastle upon Tyne on December 23, but insists he was attacked. 

He is currently recovering from reconstructive surgery as doctors battle to repair his disfigured face using grafts from other parts of his head.

But police have shelved the investigation into the alleged attack because he was too drunk to remember who attacked him, and where.

Anger: Christopher Watson, 32, claims his nose was bitten off, left and right, during his work Christmas party but is furious after police shelved their investigation because he was too drunk to remember what happened

After checking CCTV at possible locations and hunting for witnesses, officers found nothing so were unable to record the incident as a crime and suggested he may have fallen over.

Mr Watson fears the person who attacked him may now never be caught and denies he fell because he had no grazes on his hands, elbows or knees.

Now he  faces years of surgery to repair his nose, which was so severely damaged people cannot stop staring. 

Aftermath: Mr Watson says that people keep staring at him because of his injuries 

He said: 'It's been awful. People still stare at me wherever I go, in the shop, on the bus, I get people looking at me.

'I just can't get my head around the fact that this has happened to me and I don't know why.' 

He had been enjoying a Christmas do with his colleagues from Newcastle's Vermont Hotel when the mysterious incident occurred, during the early hours of December 22, 2013.

He believes he was attacked near Grey's Monument, outside Fenwick department store, in Newcastle city centre.

He said: 'All I can remember is a flash of blue, then the pain of someone biting my nose, I can just remember the excruciating pain. I was delirious, in shock and in pain'.

He then went back to the hotel he works in and a friend called an ambulance.

When Christopher got to hospital medics told him a piece of his nose, the size of a five pence piece was missing.

The hotel maintenance worker has since undergone painful skin grafts, and in December surgeons took skin from another part of his face to rebuild his nose.

Last month Christopher went under the knife again for more reconstructive surgery. And he will return to hospital this month to find out what the next stage of his treatment will be.

Christopher still believes part of his nose was bitten off. But police say there was not enough evidence to suggest a crime had taken place.

'There is no way I could have got that injury without someone else doing it. The police say I could have tripped or fallen, but I have no other bruises on my knees or hands. And I was wearing my glasses and they didn't break.

'The police have now written it off because I can't remember what happened. I thought it happened outside Fenwick but I can't be sure. They say they checked the CCTV cameras in that area and found nothing. But it could have happened somewhere else.'

Mystery: Mr Watson has had surgery twice already after the incident on December 23 - but his memory of the night is hazy, making it hard for police to discover what happened

Northumbria Police has confirmed the incident was investigated but no evidence of an attack could be found.

A spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm we received a report from the ambulance service that a man had suffered an injury. Extensive enquiries were carried out but no details of what happened or where could be clarified by the man or the person with him. If any further information is available we would ask people to contact the police.'
