Nothing says ‘mood-killer’ like having to ask a judge for permission to sleep with your partner, even if it is a soon-to-be-divorced partner.

But that is just what couples will have to do if the S787 legislation is passed in Massachusetts.

The bizarre bill proposes that couples that are going through a divorce and have children must seek a judge’s permission before having sex in their marital home.

No sex before divorce! A proposed bill in the State of Massachusetts wants spouses who are divorcing, and have children, to abstain from having sex or any sort of romantic date without permission from a judge

Not only that, couples on the brink of divorce won’t even be able to go on a dinner date with each other until their divorce is finalised.

The bill bans any sort of romantic gestures between the two separating people that has not been pre-approved by the judge.

In the current State law, there is a 120 day waiting period for an uncontested no-fault divorce.

Republican senator Richard Ross proposed the bill S787 in Massachusetts on behalf of a loyal voter who had gone through a difficult divorce

Otherwise, the entire process should take less than six months.

Massachusetts also permits fault divorces, which have a residency requirement of 1 year.

Republican Senator Richard J. Ross wants to amend Massachusettes’ current divorce law to the following:

‘In divorce, separation, or 209A proceedings involving children and a marital home, the party remaining in the home shall not conduct a dating or sexual relationship within the home until a divorce is final and all financial and custody issues are resolved, unless the express permission is granted by the courts.’

The bill was first proposed in early 2013, and it went through various hearings last week.

On Thursday March 20, it received an extension for consideration in the State House until June 30, reports Think Progress.

In a bizarre twist, Ross himself has claimed that the bill is, ‘going nowhere in the Legislature.’

He has hit back at criticism from the media, arguing that that he merely filed the bill at the request of a constituent, or loyal voter, who had gone through a difficult divorce.

The senator even wrote on the bill, ‘by request,’ meaning he disagrees with it, but is filing it for a constituent.

It’s not clear precisely what benefit the bill would have, what the penalty is for pre-divorce sex between spouses, or how the bill proposes to check up on such affairs.
