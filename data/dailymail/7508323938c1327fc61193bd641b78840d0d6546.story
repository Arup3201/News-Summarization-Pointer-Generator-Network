Reassurance: George Osborne yesterday

George Osborne flatly ruled out an electoral deal with Nigel Farage yesterday, even as he vowed never to ‘belittle’ UKIP voters.

The Chancellor sought to silence talk by worried Tory MPs of an electoral deal with the UKIP leader by insisting the only real choice at next year’s General Election was between David Cameron and Ed Miliband.

Speaking to Tory activists in London, Mr Osborne declared: ‘There will not be a pact. For a Conservative Government at the next  election, you have to vote Conservative.’ But the stern warning was coupled with a clear bid to reach out to UKIP voters and win them back to the  Conservatives.

Mr Osborne stressed how he ‘respected’ UKIP voters and Mr Farage even if he did not agree with the party’s leader.

He said: ‘The modern Conservative party will never dismiss or belittle the views of the people we aspire to represent.

‘We should show the highest respect for those who go out and cast their vote – and respect too for those who cast their vote for another party, and that includes those who voted for UKIP on Thursday.’

Difference: Lord Ashcroft's survey of key marginal seats put Labour at 41 per cent - ahead of the Tories on 29

Decisions: This graphic shows how 56 per cent of voters would definitely not vote for the Lib Dems at the next election. The figure was 49 per cent for Conservatives, 38 per cent for Labour and 52 per cent for UKIP

But Mr Osborne insisted that Mr Farage did not have ‘the answers to the country’s future’.

Liberal
 Democrat president Tim Farron told Sky News today that unlike the 
‘spineless’ other leaders, Nick Clegg had been ‘the only one with the 
bottle and the backbone to stand up to Nigel Farage’.

Tory party
 bosses are hoping their key pledge of an in/out referendum on the EU 
after the next election will be decisive in pulling back disaffected 
Conservative voters.

But the Chancellor seemed concerned yesterday that voters were yet to be convinced by the promise.

He
 said: ‘We should stop complaining that the public don’t believe us on 
our referendum pledge and instead work harder to make sure they do.’

It has been suggested that David Davies could be the Tory party's secret weapon to beat Nigel Farage's Ukip

Mr Osborne also braced his party for more bad news tonight when the European election results are unveiled.

Poll: The new survey by former Tory vice-chairman Lord Ashcroft (pictured) claims Labour is still on course for a clear General Election win

The
 Chancellor, who put the Tories’ economic competence at the centre of 
its re-election bid, said the Government would now ‘listen, respond and 
deliver’ in the wake of the voters’ verdict.

But
 he was challenged by Tory activist John Strafford to say how he would 
listen to UKIP voters opposed to controversial coalition policies such 
as high-speed rail, gay marriage or Mr Osborne’s own ‘barmy’ Help to Buy
 mortgage assistance scheme.

And, 
despite Mr Osborne taunting Labour over a ‘miserable’ result in last 
week’s local elections, a new survey by former Tory vice-chairman Lord 
Ashcroft last night claimed Labour was still on course for a clear 
General Election win.

The survey of key marginal seats put Labour at 41 per cent – way ahead of the Tories on 29. 

The
 poll found there was an average 6.5 per cent swing to Labour – enough 
to oust up to 83 Tory MPs and secure what some observers said could be a
 Labour majority of 70.

UKIP was on 18 per cent with the Lib Dems scoring just eight per cent, based on 1,000 voters in each of  the areas.

Last
 night Labour election supremo Douglas Alexander said: ‘Lord Ashcroft’s 
poll confirms that we are making real progress in seats where we need to
 do well and that Labour can win next year’s General Election.’

Prediction: A survey of key marginal seats put Ed Miliband's Labour at 41 per cent

Mr Miliband will this week visit the scene of one of the Labour’s biggest disappointments, Thurrock, in Essex, number two on its Westminster target list, where it actually lost control of the council.

‘UKIP won over some voters who feel ignored by politicians and let down by the way the country is run,’ he wrote in the Sunday Mirror. ‘Our job now is to show all of those people that we can change our country so they can build a better life for themselves and their family.'

Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron has appealed for an end to ‘absolutely foolish’ calls for Nick Clegg to quit as leader.

Mr Clegg's future has been questioned by MPs as Lib Dem candidates in target Westminster seats joined voices urging him to fall on his sword over dismal election results.

The Deputy Prime Minister has insisted he is staying despite the party losing more than 250 councillors in local elections and anticipating another rout when European election results emerge.

In a call for unity Mr Farron - a favourite to succeed Mr Clegg - said: ‘Nick Clegg should undoubtedly stay and the Liberal Democrats should stay the course in Government. There will be lots of people who are bruised by the results.’
