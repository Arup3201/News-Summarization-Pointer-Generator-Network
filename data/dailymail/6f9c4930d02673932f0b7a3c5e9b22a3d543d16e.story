A mushroom cloud rises above a row of skyscrapers in what looks like a devastating nuclear bomb blast.

But thankfully this is just a spectacular weather-front blasting in from the tempestuous Rocky Mountains near Denver, Colorado.

The unbelievable shot of the city skyline is just one of many dramatic images captured by local photographer Greg Thow.

Mr Thow, 49, has also taken equally stunning shots of lightning blasts and arching rainbows - all from the comfort of his balcony.

His work has become so well-known in his community that he often gets texts from neighbours and friends when a picturesque storm or view presents itself.

He said: 'In the case of the cloud photograph, I was just minutes from home and I drove there quickly upon receiving a text message.

'Hundreds of photos had started appearing online that afternoon from cell phones around the city - but my vantage point put the skyline squarely in front as the cloud continued to grow in size.

'Thank goodness it wasn't a nuclear bomb as I'm not sure I would be around right now to tell you about it.'

Flash: The photographer is able to capture the images - such as these lightning strikes - because his neighbors give him tip-offs about interesting weather

He has been capturing the images from his roof deck for the past six months.

His favourite is the huge rainbow, as he had to run home to take it and it 'would have disappeared' if he had been two minutes later.

The dramatic shot of a bolt of lightning illuminating the downtown part of the city is another that the photographer savours.

The mix of images is only possible because of Denver's broad weather system, which is influenced by its proximity to the Rocky Mountains and can range from blizzards to arid spells.

One local phrase is: 'If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes.'
