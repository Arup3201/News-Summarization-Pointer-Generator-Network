The Duchess of Cornwall dazzled onlookers tonight at Buckingham Palace in an exquisite diamond-encrusted tiara.

Camilla was wearing what royal watchers believe to be her family’s Cubitt-Shand tiara as she was pictured with Prince Charles arriving at a reception for members of the diplomatic corps.

It is the same headpiece she wore to her first wedding to Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973. Her daughter, Laura, also wore the family jewellery at her 2006 wedding to Harry Lopes.

The Duchess also wore diamond earrings and a pearl necklace at tonight’s event. The reception was being held by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, according to the Royal Diary.

The tiara is understood to be a legacy of Camilla’s maternal grandmother Sonia Rosemary Cubitt, Baroness Ashcombe (née Keppel).

Earlier today, the Prince of Wales made royal history by opening a new academy aimed at inspiring the broadcasters of tomorrow - by unveiling an electronic plaque. 

It took a press of a button to launch the Sky Academy Careers Lab at the west London campus of the broadcaster Sky in Osterley.

The electronic plaque appeared on a screen seconds after the heir to the throne, who was joined by the Duchess of Cornwall, touched a tablet screen. 

During their tour of the campus, Camilla could not resist trying her hand at controlling the robot cameras when the royal couple visited the Sky Sports News HQ studio.

The royal couple split up to watch groups of children working in mini news studios with the pupils acting as cameramen, presenters, directors and producers.

In another part of the campus the Duchess was intrigued by an interactive wall that showed scenes from various departments at Sky when a visitor looked through holes in the wall.
