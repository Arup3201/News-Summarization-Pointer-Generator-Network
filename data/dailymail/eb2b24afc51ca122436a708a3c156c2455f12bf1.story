A Gold Coast man has been charged withÂ  murder following the death of a mother and anti-domestic violence campaigner.

Jacob Michael Smith, 38, was tracked to a Gold Coast property less than 24 hours after being named as a person of interest.

He was allegedly one of the last people to visit Anthea Mari before the 34-year-old mother of four died at her inner-city Brisbane home early on Tuesday.

Anthea Mari, 34, was found dead in her lounge in 'suspicious circumstances' in Brisbane's south east

Police arrested a 38-year-old man at Gaven at around 10.30am on Wednesday and he was charged with murder on Wednesday night

Smith suffered a dog bite during his dramatic arrest on Wednesday before he was taken to Brisbane's Dutton park police station.

He will face Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday charged with murder, deprivation of liberty and attempt to murder.

Detective Inspector Rod Kemp would not confirm reports the victim was strangled to death before a housemate found her dead.

Smith has been described as a 'friend'.

Two of Ms Mari's children, who were sleeping in the Norman Park home on the night of her death, have received counselling.

The mother-of-four revealed that she was a long-term victim of domestic violence in a newsletter to the Catholic community group, Micah Group

Ms Mari, right, gave advice to other domestic violence sufferers. 'Don't think you're the only one. There are plenty of other women going through it, too,' Ms Mari said

Micah Projects welfare co-ordinator Karyn Walsh said Ms Mari had sought help from the community group before she became an advocate against domestic violence.

'She was a woman with her children who accessed services,' she told AAP.

'Like many women who have been through the fear of domestic violence she was very passionate about wanting to tell other women to seek help.'

Staff at Micah Projects who knew Ms Mari are 'deeply saddened and shocked by the way that she died'.

'And mostly for the children that now don't have a mother,' Ms Walsh said.

On Tuesday police released this photo of Jacob Michael Smith, 38

Clearly devoted to her family, Ms Mari's Facebook page is filled with images of her children and shared parenting tips.

'The girls are most concerned, they are getting counselling,' Detective Inspector Rod Kemp said.

'It's horrendous. It's their mother. Absolutely horrendous,' he added.

Police and paramedics were called to the house at 3:30am in Brisbane's south east after she was found dead

Two of Ms Mari's daughters, aged 11 and 12,  were at home at the time and were dressed in forensic clothes as they were led from the property

Ms Mari She also has a 15-year-old daughter who lives with her grandmother

The woman was found in Milsom St, 4km from Brisbane's CBD
