Cars burst through doors in the movies all the time, but usually the action is confined to the big screen.

A car burst through the doors of a Melbourne Village Cinema at 4.25am on Sunday, before it reversed twice into an ATM machine.

CCTV footage which captures the dramatic incident shows the dark green sedan drive out of the Karingal Drive complex in Frankston, south-east Melbourne.

While nothing was stolen, police say it was a failed effort to steal money from the ATM, reports Herald Sun.  

First Constable Scott Middenway, from Frankston police, said the incident was likely planned.

'From the footage, it looks like the location of the ATM would have been known to the offenders,' he said. 

Two cleaners were inside the complex at the time but neither were injured.

The glass doors of the cinema were destroyed, as well as substantial damage to the carpet.

The car was stolen from Carrum Downs about 1pm on Saturday, and has since been seized by police.
