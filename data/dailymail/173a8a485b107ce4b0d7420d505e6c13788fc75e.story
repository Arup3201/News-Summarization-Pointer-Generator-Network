A pensioner who fell ill on a P&O luxury cruise collapsed and died in a budget hotel room after being ‘forced off the ship and abandoned’ at a Mexican port.

Beryl Robinson, 84, was told she had to leave the cruise after a bug she is believed to have picked up on board the 950ft Arcadia developed into a chest infection.

Mrs Robinson, who uses a wheelchair, had to pay more than £2,100 for treatment in the ship’s medical centre before the doctor insisted she leave the cruise at the next port. Her family, also on the £4,250-per-person trip, said they were told it was a ‘hotel, not a hospital’.

Mrs Robinson was on the 24-night cruise from Southampton to San Francisco celebrating her 62nd wedding anniversary with husband Stanley, 85, their daughter Linda Wright, 54, and son-in-law John, 56.

Mrs Wright said: ‘Mum had been fine before the cruise. She died as a result of getting sick on that ship … forced off it and then dragged from pillar to post. She had been comfortable and stable … but they couldn’t get her off the boat fast enough.’

The sales assistant added: ‘My mother had been a loyal P&O customer since the Seventies … but when it came to her time in need they let her down and just abandoned us in Mexico. My father is devastated.’

The family from Norfolk asked to stay on board for three more days until San Francisco – where they had paid for a hotel and were due to fly home on February 4. Medical records from the ship show Mrs Robinson had responded to treatment with oxygen and antibiotics and had ‘remained stable’.

All P&O ships have a medical centre with qualified doctors on board for passengers and crew. But use of the facilities does not come cheap and the cost is not included in the cruise price.

Passengers are charged £50 for a consultation before any treatment or medication.

Admission to the centre can cost £500 a day plus the cost of any treatment or tests. An injection alone will cost £10 plus the cost of the medicine being injected.

All passengers must have travel insurance to cover medical care on board or in a foreign country, including emergency evacuation.

Mrs Wright said: ‘She could have safely stayed on board but the doctor said she had to go because “it was a hotel and not a hospital”.’ While Mr Wright stayed on the ship to make arrangements from San Francisco, the rest of the family were left in Cabo San Lucas with nowhere to stay.

‘They arranged an ambulance but then just abandoned us,’ Mrs Wright said. ‘We felt so frightened.’

Mrs Robinson, who used to run a greetings card shop, was taken to a private hospital that demanded $15,000 upfront to start treatment. She suffered ‘unnecessary fear and panic’ over what her daughter said appeared to be ‘sub–standard’ care, adding: ‘They didn’t even wash her for three days.’

Mr Wright, a haulage contractor, said they struggled to get help from their travel insurance so were forced to pay for hotels and medical bills and claim it back later. He added: ‘I had to transfer our savings to the hospital … The insurance company was taking too long.’

Mrs Robinson was one of many passengers who the family say fell ill on the ship – which has been accused of inflicting the ‘Arcadia cough’ on some of its customers.

Mr Wright said they noticed fellow travellers coughing within days of the cruise starting on January 6.

‘We all picked up this cough but Beryl’s gradually became more profound,’ he said. Mrs Robinson became breathless and was moved to the medical centre.

Her son-in-law added: ‘An elderly gentleman was also taken off [the ship] with her. His wife had to sleep on a hospital couch because she had no access to money.'

Mrs Robinson was taken off the ship on January 27 and admitted to hospital where she received oxygen and antibiotics before being released three days later.

The family then faced the ordeal of getting to San Francisco where they could fly home. Mrs Wright said: ‘We had to find, book and pay for the transport ourselves. My poor mother had to go from taxi to coach to plane to taxi … it was a huge upheaval and incredibly draining.’

Once they arrived on January 30 they planned to stay at the Hyatt where they had a four-night stay booked within the cruise package which also included their flights.

‘We thought it was all booked but P&O had cancelled the hotel and the flights because Linda, Beryl and Stanley had left the ship,’ Mr Wright said. ‘They then refused to help us rearrange them … We had to find the money to pay for flights and a hotel again even though we had already paid for it all.’

The family managed to get flights but while waiting to travel home, Mrs Robinson died in her hotel room on January 31.

‘The doctors said it looked like a cardiac arrest,’ Mrs Wright said.

‘The trauma and upheaval had been too much … Our doctor saw her records and said there was no reason for her to come off that ship … I believe she would be here today if it wasn’t for the cough and how P&O treated her.’

To add insult to injury, Mr Robinson later received a call from P&O checking whether his wife had got home safely. 

Mrs Wright said: ‘He was so upset, he just said, “She never made it home, she’s dead”, and hung up.’ The family, who are making an insurance claim for their costs, must wait for a death certificate before the body can be repatriated at a further cost of £5,000.

P&O said the decision to leave Mrs Robinson in Mexico was ‘in her best interests at the time’, adding: ‘Unfortunately it is necessary occasionally for the ship’s medical centre to refer sick patients to a shore-based hospital for specialist treatment.’
