Slowing down: Doug Gregory has been advised to stop flying for decades but only now, at the age of 90, is he retiring

Britain's oldest stunt pilot Doug Gregory has reluctantly given up his daredevil aerobatics but insists he will continue to take to the skies.

The 90-year-old former RAF and commercial pilot said is selling his homemade 1917 replica stunt plane because it is too difficult to operate.

The pensioner said giving up his dangerous manoeuvres was a difficult decision to make because of his lifelong passion for flying.

Mr Gregory said: 'I will miss it terribly and it is very sad to see it go. But it is difficult to get in and out of and very hard to start. 

His replica wartime plane cost £5,000 
pounds to build between 1983 and 1987.

'It
 was a brilliant plane for doing stunts and lovely at aerobatics.

'When 
you get up there turning upside down and everything it is no trouble at 
all. It all comes out alright in the end. 

'It
 was quite a special moment when it was completed and I was so pleased.

'It has been super and always great fun it really was.'

After survivng 67 missions into Germany in World War Two and a brain haemorrhage in 1947, Mr Gregory said he defied naysayers who told him to give up his hobby.

He was told he would never fly again after his illness. Mr
 Gregory said: 'The inspiration to make my own plane was being told I 
would never fly again. I never believed it and of course they were 
wrong.

'It
 was obvious I could never do commercial flying after my record of being
 hospital but it wasn't very long before I started flying again and I 
never stopped.

Lifelong passion: During his time in the RAF, Mr Gregory survived 67 missions into occupied Germany

Creation: The stunt pilot in his RAF uniform beside the plane he built himself and has now put on the market

'After my retirement I knew exactly what I wanted to do and very glad I did it.'

The pilot, who flies to WW1 memorials
 in France spent four years constructing his own 
aircraft, which he flew for nine years in the Great War Display Team.

'When I was old enough I joined the 
Air Force at 18 straight after my birthday. I tried to join earlier but 
they wouldn't have me. 

'Flying
 has been my favourite thing all my life, especially aerobatics. I don't
 do any other kind of sport. Flying is quite enough to keep me going.'

Former school teacher Doug has been 
taking to the cockpit for over seven decades and still holds all the 
relevant licenses making him one of Britain's oldest pilots.

Despite giving up the risky stunts the daredevil promised to carry on being airborne until the day he dies.

Dedication: Mr Gregory began building his stunt plane in 1983 when he was told he would never fly again because he suffered a brain hemorrhage

Priceless: The replica plane cost £5,000 pounds to build between 1983 and 1987 and is now being sold to an aviation enthusiast

Doug said: 'I
 plan to stop flying when I die. That is all that can stop me. My family
 think I am nuts but know I can't be all that bad otherwise I wouldn't 
still be alive doing it.

'I
 am not sure what I love about it so much, it is like the sailors love 
of the sea. When you are up there you are in charge of everything. It is
 great. 

'I still enjoy it 
now as much as when I was younger. People who like flying when they 
drive to the aerodrome they get faster and faster in excitement before 
they get there. I still do. 

'It is the place where I want to be - up in the air. It is just wonderful.'

Up, up and away: The 90-year-old said he feels at home when he is flying and said he enjoys it 'as much as when I was younger'

Habit: The pensioner said he will give up stunts and dangerous tricks but will still fly every week
