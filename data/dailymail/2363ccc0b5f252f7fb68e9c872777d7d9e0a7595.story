Four members of a family have died in a three-vehicle crash in South Australia's south-east on Monday

It is believed that the family were returning home after working at the family-owned business 'Waves of Robe' in Robe in the Limestone Coast of South Australia.

A family friend, Wendy Zadow, from Mount Gambier told Daily Mail Australia the town has been shaken up by the tragic news and thoughts are with the kids' father and Michelle's husband, Darren.

'We were neighbours for many years and our children played together a lot and I knew them very well,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'They used to own one of the Mobil Service Stations here in Mount Gambier and so everyone knew the family very well.

'Josh has a restaurant 'Waves of Robe' at Robe, so they would've been travelling home to Mt Gambier.

'It's bad any time when an accident happens but this close to Christmas - it's extra sad.'

Jessica Doyle and her grandmother Bev Khan, 68, both died after a horrific car accident at Hatherleigh

The family were believed to be returning home from Robe, where Josh Doyle runs a restaurant  

Community member Josh Lynagh told Daily Mail Australia: 'When something like this happens, it's shocking for the whole community.

'Today locals are mourning the loss of a local family, tragically killed as the result of a horrible accident just north of Millicent.

'These were people many of us knew, and I'm sure those who knew them well could tell you more about just what our community has lost.

'In times like this, in the midst of mourning and trying to come to terms with everything, we must also take the time to cherish the lives of those important to us, and to remember all aspects of safe driving - especially coming into the holiday season when our roads will be busier than ever.

'Rest in Peace to those we have lost, and my personal condolences to those who have a long recovery ahead of them, both physically and emotionally.'

The collision occured at an intersection of the Princes Highway and Main Road at Hatherleigh, north of Millicent

The community and friends have taken to Facebook to share their grief and pay tribute to the family.

'Oh Josh you were such a great kid. We will never understand why this tragedy occurred. We think of your father during this distressing time. RIP now Josh x'

'R.I.P beautiful people you'll never be forgotten'

'Beautiful babies. Forever young. RIP x'

'it's heart wrenching to know the family that was lost due to what seems to be careless driving. I can't fathom the pain that family is going through right now. To bury your wife and your only 2 children anytime let alone just before Christmas is something that no one ever should have to go through. R.I.P '

'Sad day for the southeast, sending prayers to all those effected by yesterday's tragedy' 

Police say a ute and a truck collided, followed by a four-wheel-drive at about 11.45am on Monday

The fifth person in the vehicle, the front seat passenger, was taken to Mt Gambier Hospital with minor injuries

The two male drivers of the utility and truck were taken to Millicent Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

Traffic Support Branch Officer in Charge Superintendent Bob Fauser told Daily Mail Australia that police are currently investigating the crash site.

'Four people, all from the same family have died. An event like this will impact the family, their friends and the close-knit community of the South-East forever.

'I ask everyone to pause for a moment and put yourself in the position of this family and consider whether even one death on our roads is acceptable. And if for even a moment you think that it is acceptable - then ask yourself, would it be acceptable if it was your family?'

Two other drivers from the utility and truck were taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries

Police are currently investigating the crash scene but all roads have reopened again

Police Commissioner Gary Burns told ABC Radio it was a real tragedy for a whole family to be killed at any time, but particularly in the lead-up to Christmas. 

Mt Gambier Senior Sergeant Chris King told Adelaide Now that it was too early to determine what had caused the accident.

'It’s a tragic scene, terrible, it’s a great loss of life,' he told Adelaide Now.

'Country roads are inherently dangerous places to drive and we urge anyone driving on country roads not to be complacent and to drive appropriately to the conditions.

'Any of these incidents are terrible because you know there is a family that is going to be destroyed over Christmas and for a long time on.'

 The four tragic deaths bring the States' road toll to 92 compared to 91 at the same time last year

Police Major Crash Investigators were called to the crash site, with the Princes Highway closed for several hours to all traffic.

A South Australian police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that police are currently investigating the scene but all roads have reopened again. 

The four tragic deaths bring the States' road toll to 92 compared to 91 at the same time last year.

Meanwhile, a 72-year-old man died later on Monday after his car collided with a parked car at Norwood in Adelaide.
