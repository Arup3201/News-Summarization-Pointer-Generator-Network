Two third grade pupils have been suspended after cracking the school's computer network to find sexually explicit images and sharing them with classmates.

A nine-year-old girl, who attends Sunnycrest Elementary School in Lake Stevens, Washington, was using a school computer during class, when she was able to access the porn.

She then circulated the images among her classmates before teachers became aware of the situation.

The incident only emerged when an email was sent to parents promising that a full investigation into the incident would take place.

The girl and another student have now been suspended from the school, with Lake Stevens School District promising a probe into how the student was able to find the pictures despite filters being in place. 

But some parents have reacted angrily after learning their children had seen the explicit images.

Austin Maxwell, whose eight-year-old stepdaughter attends the school, told K5 that she was upset after seeing the pictures and that he was shocked a child was able to find such content on a school computers.

He said: 'We never in he world would have thought she was accessing what she was accessing on the school's equipment.'

The third grade student was said to find the explicit images after circumnavigating the school's computer network which filters adult content

The email sent to parents by district officials said that all student computer use at the school is being suspended until a full investigation takes place.

It read: 'Once staff members became aware of the situation, Information Technology technicians were immediately notified and all student computer use at Sunnycrest is suspended until our investigation is complete.

'To ensure that all images have been removed, our technicians have deleted content from all Sunnycrest third-grade students' computer accounts.

'In addition, all students will be once again reminded about digital citizenship and the importance of notifying an adult right away when encountering inappropriate content. '
