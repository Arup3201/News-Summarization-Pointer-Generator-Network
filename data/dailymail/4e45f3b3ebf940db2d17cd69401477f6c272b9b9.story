A scientist struck down by malaria seven times is leading the search for new drugs - to stop transmission of the deadly disease.

Dr Rita Tewari, of Nottingham University, has completed what she describes as a 'Herculean study' into the roles played by enzymes as the malaria parasite develops in the body.

Dr Tewari, born and brought up in Delhi,
 India, said: 'This latest 
study identifies how protein phosphatases regulate parasite development.

'Our research provides a systematic functional analysis for all the 30 phosphatases in Plasmodium berghei - the parasite responsible for causing malaria.

'These enzymes work in tandem with the protein kinases identified by the same team in a complementary study carried out in 2010.'

Dr Tewari, who now leads her own malaria research laboratory at Nottingham University, added: 'If we can find out what proteins are essential for these parasites to develop and divide, maybe we can target those proteins and arrest them with drugs or vaccines.'

Malaria remains one of the most deadly scourges of the developing world - killing up to one million people and causing disease in 300 to 500 million people every year.

In humans the deadliest form of malaria is caused by the single cell parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

Disrupting the life cycle of the malaria parasite could save the lives of millions of people.

Malaria parasite development and cues controlling it is still not fully understood.

What Dr Tewari’s team is trying to do is understand the basic developmental biology of these parasites.

Dr Tewari’s new research was carried out in collaboration with the Medical Research Council’s National Institute for Medical Research (MRC-NIMR) in London, together with colleagues at Oxford University, Imperial College, London and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.

Dr Tony Holder, Head of the MRC-NIMR Division of Parasitology, said: 'Inhibitors of protein kinases are already used in treatments for other diseases and there is growing interest to develop phosphatase inhibitors as drugs.

'Identifying the key kinases and phosphatases in the parasite life cycle will define the targets for drug development to treat human malaria and prevent its transmission in communities by the mosquito.'

Dr Tewari added: 'Interestingly, out of the 14 genes that could be knocked out, six were found to be crucial for sexual development and hence could be drug targets for parasite transmission to and from the mosquito.

'The race to uncover new vaccines and more effective drugs to treat disease and block malaria transmission is becoming ever more important.'

David Brook, Professor of Human Genetics and Director of Research in the School of Life Sciences at Nottingham University, said: 'Despite being a small research group, Rita’s lab packs a powerful punch and they are really putting Nottingham on the world map for malaria research.'

Dr Tewari's findings have been published in the journal Cell Host and Microbe.
