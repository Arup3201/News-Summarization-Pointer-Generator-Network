A popular beach was cordoned off after eight Second World War explosives were found on the busy Bank Holiday Monday.

Bomb disposal experts were called to blow up one device which was still live on Mappleton beach in Humberside.

A 200-metre cordon was put in place by Hornsea Coastguard and Humberside Police while the explosives were investigated after a woman walking along the sands at lunchtime found three shells.

Emergency: One of the eight explosives that were found on the beach in East Yorkshire on Monday

In total, eight devices were found with one still live and officials believed they had been washed down from the cliffs above.

A spokesman for the Coastguard said: 'After determining that most of the ordnance was safe, one device was still live and had to be detonated in location.'

The area was dubbed Bomb Alley Beach 
after a landslide in 2012 saw 1,000 rockets and grenades  tumble out of 
the cliffs three quarters of a mile away.

Search: The incident took five hours to make the beach safe again after eight bombs were found

Chris Cook, Coastguard Rescue Officer at Hornsea, said it took the team more than five hours to make the area safe - and warned members of the public to be vigilant. 

'It's something people always need to be aware of. The area is designated Ministry of Defence as it's the old bombing range used by the RAF,' he said.

'Even though a lot are practice rounds, they still contain a lot of explosives that could cause injuries. The safest option is to assume they are live as it's not worth taking a chance.'

In 2012, residents were told they weren't in any danger, after 1,000 missiles fell in a landslide.

The weapons, including rockets, mortars and 25lb (11kg) shells, took days to clear after the 2012 landslide

The Second World War missiles had buried themselves in
 the earth cliffs after missing their target when the area was used as a
 practice bombing range from the war until the early 1970s.

At the time, nearby families said they had no idea there was any danger.

Joyce Nicholson said: ‘I did not know anything about this. It’s 
disgusting they have not sorted this out in nearly 70 years. This place 
is very popular.

‘There needs to be more warning signs
 and bigger warning signs especially this time of year when hundreds of 
children will be coming down. The whole beach should be closed really 
but I suppose they do not want to scare everybody.

‘It is not that far from the beach to where the bombs are and if they are blowing things up they really should tell people.’

The East Riding beach of Mappleton, near Hornsea, was used as a practice bombing range during the Second World War

Mike Puplett, watch manager at Humber 
Coastguard, told MailOnline in 2012: 'It’s an old firing range from 
World War Two and an area where we do get explosives and grenades.

'When the cliff sinks it is a fairly 
regular occurrence that we get one or two.

'But there has been a fairly 
significant landslide occurred due to the erosion and bad weather which 
has caused it to slip.'
