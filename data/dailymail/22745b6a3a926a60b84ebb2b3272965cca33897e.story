'Do you want me to do it in Texas voice?' Claire Campbell's son asks before he begins a highly entertaining performance through various music genres.

The remarkable youngster's imagination was fired by the phrase 'time is a-wastin'', which he had overheard his father say at dinner.

The seven-year-old explores nine styles of singing as he creates an impromptu dinner performance, much to the glee of his parents and three-year-old brother.

Ms Campbell uploaded the clip - on website Storyful - which shows the little boy creating a musical piece which starts off focusing on the throwaway phrase, to which he adds his own lyrics.

The evening of entertainment kicks off with a distinctly country and western sounding Texas rendition. 

He then swiftly moves on to a rather impressive operatic style, complete with hand gestures and dramatic facial expressions, before switching to rock 'n' roll.

Applause please: His brother can be heard clapping in the background 

Dinner gets cold as the child takes it down a notch with a lullaby delivery, adding even more lyrics to the 'song'

The boy's three-year-old brother giggles delightedly in the background as the song genres become more and more varied.

Things then take a surreal turn as he goes 'underwater' for his next musical styling, rubbing his lips as he sings to give the tune a distinctly 'watery' feel. 

Remarkable talent: Unsure of the style his song should adopt, the boy tries it out in alternative tunes and voices

His brother can be heard clapping in the background as the talented child moves on to a 'cool dude' rendition complete with 'musical instrument' noises and hand movements.

He then moves on in quick succession to a baby voice, the jaded tones of a bored child, and pirate version before ending the song in his clear and natural singing voice. 

The impressive performance ends with a flourish as the young man takes a bow and says knowingly to the camera: 'I hope I get applause, whoever watches this.'

He walks out of the room as he says 'arrivederci, parting is such sad [sic] sorrow'.

It's showtime: The 'cool dude' style included 'musical instrument' noises and hand movements
