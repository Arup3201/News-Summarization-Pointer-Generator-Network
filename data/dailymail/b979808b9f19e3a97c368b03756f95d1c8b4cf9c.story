Fine at Lidl car park: Beryl Bourne-Mullen (left), 85, went shopping with her daughter Nina (right), 54

A disabled pensioner was given a £90 parking fine for taking too long to shop at Lidl.

Beryl Bourne-Mullen, 85, who suffers from osteoarthritis, went shopping for Christmas presents and food with her daughter Nina, 54, at the supermarket’s store in Sevenoaks, Kent.

The mother-of-two - who admits she is ‘slow’ and takes more time than an average person to get up and down the aisles - was shocked after a letter came in the post a week after their trip.

The pair, who admit not noticing the signs in the car park which notified customers of a 90-minute free parking restriction, had already spent £95.88 in the store when they broke the time limit by 15 minutes.

Mrs Bourne-Mullen said: ‘I am very upset, I am very angry and I do not think it is fair what happened to us. I walk with a stick and I take a very long time to get around places.

‘I rely on my daughter to take me around and now she has been given a ticket because of me. I feel awful and I feel like a burden to her. It is a horrible thing to feel all because of a parking ticket.

‘It takes me a lot longer to get round the shops than a normal person and I was doing a big shop because I wanted to stock up for Christmas. My daughter was also very angry.

‘There was no ticket on the car but we got a letter in the post around a week later. We were only 15 minutes over the time, and it is so unfair that we have been fined.

‘It is a shame because I will not be going back to the shop again and they have lost my money now. It has been a very stressful time for me and my family - this is a lot of money.

‘We have basically paid double for the shopping just because I am slow. I am so very upset and angry.’

Her daughter, a printer, who lives with her mother in Sevenoaks, said: ‘I have never had a fine before and we had no idea there was a limit. It’s a supermarket.

‘My main concern at the time was getting my mother in and out of the shop. If I’d known, I wouldn’t have taken her there because she is handicapped and it takes time with an older person to go round a shop.

‘She’d not been there before and wanted to have a good nosey round and we ended up spending a lot of money.

‘I appreciate that the store is near the station and they don’t want people taking spaces for too long but other supermarkets give customers two-and-a-half to three hours.

‘It would be pretty obvious to anyone who saw us on camera that my mother walks with a stick and is slow. But I’ve been to Lidl and they’ve said it’s all done by a private company and it’s nothing to do with them.

‘During this season people are doing bigger and longer shops than they normally do so I want to make people aware of the situation because the signs are not obvious.’

Previous incident: Blind Anne Lazell (left), 73, told the Mail in August how her carer Heather Dawson (right) got a £90 fine because they had exceeded the 60 minutes allowed in a Lidl car park in Hadleigh, Essex

A Lidl spokesman said: ‘While the vast majority of our store car parks do not have any car park management systems in place, we do have procedures in place in a small number of our store car parks, to help manage the availability of car parking spaces and ensure that our customers take priority.

‘Some of these car parks are managed by ourselves or accredited contractors and some are managed by our landlords. In retail parks where we do not own the car parks, we are, consequently, not in charge of the management of those car parks.

‘We do however encourage any genuine Lidl customers who have received a parking charge notice to get in touch with us directly via our customer services hotline number.

‘Customers who have overstayed in one of our car parks should then just provide us with proof of purchase and we will appeal the charge on their behalf.

‘Customers who have special requirements and may have difficulty with the parking restrictions in place should also get in touch with our customer services team who will find a solution to their car parking needs.’

It is not the first incident of its kind - after a blind pensioner who needs a carer to help her around supermarkets received a parking fine at another Lidl store because she took too long to shop.

Anne Lazell, 73, who had been shopping in Hadleigh, Essex, told the Daily Mail in August that after her two-hour visit her carer got a £90 fine  because they had exceeded the 60 minutes allowed.
