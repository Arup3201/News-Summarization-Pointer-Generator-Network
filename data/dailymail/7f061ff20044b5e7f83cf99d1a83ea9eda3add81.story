The military's new-generation of F-35 fighter jets are being allowed to fly again after a engine fire scare last month, but they won't be showcased at this Farnborough International Airshow in England as originally planned.

Navy
 Rear Adm. John Kirby says that while limited flights have been approved
 for the aircraft, there are a number of restrictions that would make it
 difficult for the fighter jets to fly across the Atlantic to the 
airshow. One restriction requires an engine inspection after every three hours of flight.

The
 entire fleet of nearly 100 planes was grounded after a fire at Eglin 
Air Force Base in Florida. Kirby says inspections so far have not 
revealed a systemic problem and defense officials feel 'increasingly 
comfortable' that the aircraft will be able to return to full flight.

The Pentagon 
announced on Tuesday that Navy and Air Force officials approved the 
flight resumption on Monday but imposed restrictions that will remain in
 effect until the cause of a June 23 engine fire is identified and 
corrected.

The F-35 is the Pentagon's most expensive aircraft program, costing an estimated $400 billion.

Three variants of the aircraft are being developed and built, one each for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.

The
 Marines expect to field their version next summer, the Air Force will 
follow in 2016, and the Navy a year after that. International buyers 
include Britain, South Korea, Israel, Italy, Australia, Canada, Turkey 
and Japan.

Members of Congress, however, have 
complained that the program has been troubled with testing problems, 
delays and cost overruns. The jet is intended to replace Cold War-era 
aircraft such as the Air Force F-16 fighter, the Navy's F/A-18 Hornet 
and the Marines' EA-6B Prowler and AV-8B Harrier.
