Rising numbers of schools are abandoning A-levels in favour of alternative qualifications amid anger at constant ‘meddling’ with the exam system.

Demand for exams created for pupils in China, India and the United States has soared nearly 50 per cent in a year, with top private schools leading the charge away from the ‘gold standard’ A-level.

With teenagers across the country awaiting A-level results next week, it emerged that more than 100 British schools entered pupils for an international version of the exam amid ‘instability’ in the domestic system.

Figures also show a four per cent surge in the numbers choosing the International Baccalaureate, a broad-based diploma qualification offered around the world.

And a third alternative to A-levels - the Cambridge Pre-U - has seen a 10 per cent spike in demand compared with last year.

Head teachers are predicting that appetite for alternative qualifications will rise again over the next two years as the Coalition ushers in further reforms to A-levels.

Former Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered a radical overhaul of the exam to restore rigour to the system by scrapping pass-as-you-go modules and bringing back end-of-course exams.

But critics are concerned at ‘political interference’ in exams and the possibility that changes could be reversed by a future Labour administration.

There is also opposition to the splitting of AS-levels from the main A-level, which will put an end to the practice of awarding pupils a grade half-way through their A-level courses.

International A-levels have been offered for more than 50 years by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) for schools overseas. Syllabuses are designed to avoid cultural bias and take a global approach. They also retain AS-levels at the half-way stage of the courses.

Figures from CIE show that pupils took 1,377 International A-levels this summer – up from 927 last year.

Whereas last year 72 schools entered pupils, more than 100 – most of them private schools - did so this year. Some 36 are enrolling significant numbers of entratns.

The International Baccalaureate, meanwhile, was developed in Geneva to offer sixth-formers around the world a broad education, with pupils taking a range of subjects as well as writing an extended essay and undertaking community work.

Latest figures, from the International Baccalaureate Organisation, show that 4,790 UK candidates took the qualification this year – up from 4,589 in 2013.

Some 153 UK schools are offering the IB this year – 82 private and 71 state.

The Cambridge Pre-U was devised by CIE in 2008 as a more traditional and rigorous approach to sixth-form study, with more emphasis on written exams and less coursework. Dozens of private schools offer it in some subjects, including Eton.

CIE said entries for the Pre-U had risen from 3,831 last year to 4,232.

At the same time, the number of A-level entries this year declined three per cent, although it remains the qualification of choice for the vast majority of sixth-formers.

Tim Hands, chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents leading private schools, said: ‘The numbers at the moment seem to be small but these movements could be indicative.

‘There is considerable concern about the changes and the way in which the changes will be implemented, and schools will be looking at alternatives.’

There was less scope for ‘political interference’ and ‘meddling’ in qualifications such as the IA-level and IB, he said.

‘We are all uncertain about what lies ahead. The mood inside independent and maintained schools generally is wait and see, but wait and see with apprehension and not wait and see with confidence.’

The Perse School, in Cambridge, has already introduced the International A-level in biology and will consider moving towards it in other subjects.

Headmaster Ed Elliott said that one attraction of IA-levels was that they were ‘stable’ at a time of ‘great change at A-level’.

‘The other great attraction of the International A-level is that it keeps the AS-level component and you have public exam results at the end of the lower-sixth,’ he said.

Pupils worked harder and paced themselves better if they faced an exam half-way through their A-level courses, which also provided valuable information for universities, he said.

‘The reforms Michael Gove put into action were a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There were some problems with A-level that needed reform but not this wholesale, rushed-in reform which could create a whole series of worse problems,’ he warned.

Dr David James, director of the IB at Wellington College, the Berkshire public school, said: ‘Unlike many schools, we offer both the IB diploma and A-levels and the trend we’re seeing is strongly towards the IB.

‘The numbers have doubled since 2012 to nearly half our 210-strong sixth form. We know why this is because our students tell us: it’s about the increasing competition for the best university places.’

A number of top UK universities are now making ‘very attainable offers’ to students taking the IB, he said.

‘The IB can also be a ‘golden ticket’ to overseas universities,’ Dr James said. ‘Many of our pupils have their sights set on elite US universities and this year we have IB students going to Harvard, UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), New York University and Columbia.

‘The other reason is that the best and brightest students want to take a course which is more intellectual, more fun and more interesting with real links between the subjects.

‘The way we run IB classes at Wellington is at first-year university level and the IB organisation has evidence that IB students are less likely to drop out of university, showing what great preparation the IB is for further education, as well as all-round intellectual and character development.’
