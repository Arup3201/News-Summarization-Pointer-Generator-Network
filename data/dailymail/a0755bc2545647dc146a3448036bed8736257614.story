To many of her women colleagues, she is a heroine for winning a landmark ageism case against the BBC.

The efforts of Miriam O’Reilly, however, appear to have been lost on the younger Julia Bradbury.

The two women, both former presenters of Countryfile, have become involved in a row after Miss Bradbury disputed that the 57-year-old had been a victim of age discrimination on the show.

So furious is Miss O’Reilly that she yesterday called 43-year-old Miss Bradbury a BBC ‘a**e licker’ and ‘arrogant’.

Miss Bradbury – nicknamed ‘the walking man’s crumpet’ for presenting many  outdoor programmes for the BBC – said  in a Saturday newspaper interview  that Miss O’Reilly’s departure from  Countryfile in 2009 was simply a result of planned changes to the show’s format rather than discrimination.

Miss Bradbury said: ‘I’ve been through millions of programme changes where they say, “Sorry, love, we’ve changed the slot”. It happened with Watchdog – they brought Anne Robinson back.

‘With Miriam, the decision certainly wasn’t made because she was old. The decision was because they were changing the programme.’

The comments infuriated Miss O’Reilly, who sent Miss Bradbury a series of messages on Twitter.

She wrote: ‘So you know better than three judges in a legal case and former BBC DG [director general] Mark Thompson who accepted the tribunal decision?

‘Before you make ill-informed statements I suggest you look at the legal case – one day you might need it. Until then good luck with the a**e licking.’

Miss Bradbury did not respond to any of the tweets, and yesterday friends said she wanted to maintain a dignified silence.

Miss O’Reilly told the Daily Mail she believed Miss Bradbury was simply voicing the defiance of senior producers on Countryfile, whom she claims have refused to accept the employment tribunal’s 2011 ruling.

She added: ‘It really is a pathetic thing to say. She has just made herself look rather silly. I think it displays a certain arrogance.

‘If she had studied the tribunal judgment, and it is online, she might have a different view. But it was an ill-informed view and not helpful to her or other older women in television. Frankly I feel there was some a**e licking there.’

At the tribunal Miss O’Reilly said she had been devastated when she was told in November 2008 that she was being dropped from Countryfile after eight years of working for the Sunday lunchtime show as a freelance.

The programme relaunched in April the following year in a Sunday evening prime-time slot with Miss Bradbury and former Blue Peter presenter Matt Baker, 33, along with long-serving host John Craven, 70.

In the wake of her victory against the BBC, Miss O’Reilly was given a three-year deal to return to the corporation. But in 2012 she announced she was leaving to launch a support service for women facing discrimination in the workplace.

It was that year that the BBC’s then director general, Mr Thompson, admitted there were ‘manifestly too few older women broadcasting on the BBC’ and said he hoped Miss O’Reilly’s age discrimination tribunal would be seen as a ‘turning point’.

This month Miss Bradbury announced she was leaving Countryfile after agreeing to do shows with ITV.
