Nani's disappointing return to Sporting Lisbon continued as he was involved in a bizarre incident which saw a team-mate sent off. 

Sporting drew 1-1 with unfancied Belenenses, their third stalemate in four games so far this season. 

But the main talking point come when on-loan Manchester United winger Nani and Jefferson tried to forcibly remove an injured Belenenses player from the pitch, who they believed was playacting deep into stoppage time.  

The Sporting players tried to lift their opponent by the wrists and ankles but the referee failed to see the funny side of it, giving Brazilian defender Jefferson his marching orders after brandishing a second yellow card. 

Deyverson gave Belenenses a 28th minute lead before Andre Carrillo equalised for Sporting seven minutes later.

Nani returned to his first club in August after seven years away but it's fair to say things haven't quite gone to plan. 

He missed a penalty, picked up a yellow card and was substituted in Sporting's 1-0 win over Arouca on his debut last month.
