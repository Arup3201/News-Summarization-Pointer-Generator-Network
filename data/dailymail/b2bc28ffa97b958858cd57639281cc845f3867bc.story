The entire back catalogue of John Lennon’s solo work is now available on Spotify.

In total eight studio albums and three compilations of his material are available to stream.

But the rest of material by The Beatles remains unavailable on the popular music platform or any of its rivals.

John Lennon (shown) joins his other former band members in having his music available on Spotify. The musician was shot dead by a crazed fan in New York on 9 Dec 1980. His eight studio albums and three compilations are all available. This joins the works of Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr and George Harrison

Lennon, whose 74th birthday would have been tomorrow, was shot dead by crazed fan Mark Chapman in New York on 8 December 1980

Now, despite rights to songs by The Beatles remain elusive, Lennon posthumously joins other members on Spotify.

Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have their full discographies on Spotify, while a few songs from George Harrison are available.

Albums 

Milk And Honey

Plastic Ono Band

Rock 'N' Roll

Imagine

Mind Games

Some Time In New York City

Walls And Bridges

Double Fantasy 

 

Compilations

'Gimme Some Truth'

Signature Box' 

'Power To The People: The Hits’

The reason for the band’s songs being absent is apparently due to an agreement signed with iTunes in 2010 - where the music exclusively appears.

The latest move to add Lennon's music comes as Spotify begins to face competition to its dominance of the streaming market.

In May 2014 it reportedly had 40 million users, doubling from 20 million users in December 2012.

But earlier this year Amazon unveiled its own music streaming service for its Prime members in a bid to take on Spotify and Apple’s iTunes.

The Prime Music service featured heavily on its Amazon Fire smartphone, offering more than a million tracks for ad-free streaming and download to Fire devices.

And in July Google bought streaming music service Songza.

The firm said it will incorporate the service into its own Google Music in a bid to take on Spotify, Amazon and Apple.

Due to an exclusivity agreement with iTunes, music by The Beatles remains noticeably missing. Tomorrow would have been John Lennon's 74th birthday. Pictured is Lennon's page on Spotify
