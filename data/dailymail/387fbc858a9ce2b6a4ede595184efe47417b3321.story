A former New York call girl who claims to have been choked by Eliot Spitzer during an X-rated encounter has also accused the Manhattan District Attorney's Office of 'pimping' her out to catch a notorious madam.

In her new tell-all book, Rebecca Woodard, now-37, alleges she was pushed by prosecutors working under ex-District Attorney Robert Morgenthau to keep up her pricey prostitution after she agreed to wear a wire to help catch Anna Gristina in 2008.

'They wanted me to keep breaking the law so they could get more information,' Woodard writes in 'Call Girl Confidential.' 'It was like sex slavery at the behest of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.'

Informant: Rebecca Woodard, pictured left and right, claims she was pushed by prosecutors to keep up her pricey prostitution after she agreed to wear a wire to help catch Anna Gristina in 2008

Tell-all: Woodard wrote the book, Call Girl Confidential pictured, under the alias 'Rebecca Kade'

According to The New York Post, she 
claims an assistant DA, who she doesn't name in the book, told her to 
keep working so she could garner information to help the case.

Woodard,
 who writes for Simon & 
Schuster under the alias 'Rebecca Kade,' also alleges she was told to
 give the cash she earned in her sessions and any gifts she was given by clients to the 
office.

'Technically, this ADA was my pimp,' she writes.

Woodard
 explains she had already begun servicing high-rolling johns as part of Gristina's 
prostitution ring when the DA's office asked her to go undercover.

But she writes in the book the operation was so secret that even Morgenthau had no idea.

Boss: Robert Morgenthau (pictured) was Manhattan's District Attorney at the time however, Woodard writes in the book that she doesn't believe he was aware of the 'shenanigans' of his staff

Guilty: Woodard went undercover to help authorities gather enough evidence to prosecute Anna Gristina, pictured

'I highly doubt District Attorney Morgenthau was aware of the ADA's shenanigans,' Woodard writes.

'God knows if somebody pocketed the 
money (earned through the prostitution). (And) this cowboy still has a 
job in law enforcement, in another state, at an even higher level' as 
'an assistant US attorney.'

A spokesman for the Manhattan DA's office declined comment to MailOnline.

Woodard described the people she worked with as bumbling fools when it came to surveillance, the Post reports.

She
 describes one occasion when they tried to fit the wire around her waist
 and up her chest so she could record Gristina's accountant Jonas Gayer 
during a meeting at his apartment.

'Client': Eliot Spitzer, pictured, enjoyed violence in the bedroom, pinning a former call girl to a bed and clutching at her throat until she struggled to breathe, she claims

'"Are
 you kidding me?" I nearly screamed,' Woodward writes. '"It's not going 
to work to wire my body, because the very first thing heâ€™s going to do 
is feel me up."'

In the end, the DA's office bought her a designer handbag to hide the wire in.

After a while as an informant, she felt Gristina was becoming suspicious and she writes that she wanted out.

'The ADA stared at me, and his face was turning red,' Woodard explains. 'He stormed out of the room... I never heard from him again.'

After that former prosecutor Seema Iyer became her public defender. Appalled at her treatment, the lawyer told her she could bring a lawsuit against the city, Woodard writes.

Later, the assistant DA left his job for another role and his replacement allegedly told her all her hard work had been for nothing and would be 'thrown out because it would be inadmissible in court.'

They then asked her to wear a wiretap again, and she writes that they threatened to arrest her for prostitution if she didn't.

'It was blackmail,' she claims in the book. 'I felt like he was trying to intimidate me into going back to work for them under these threats.'

Also in the book, Woodard names Eliot Spitzer as a former client and claims he enjoyed violence in the bedroom, at one point even choking her. He has denied being involved with the woman.
