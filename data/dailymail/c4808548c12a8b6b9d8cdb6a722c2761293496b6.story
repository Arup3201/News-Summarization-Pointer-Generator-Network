A man with a massive 13lbs tumour on his neck is recovering after having the massive growth removed.

Stefan Zoleik, a father-of-two from Martin, Slovakia,  endured 10 years with the fatty lump growing from ear to ear.

Doctors were unable to operate for years because of other health complications but he has now undergone a five-hour procedure to remove the growth.

Before and after: The father-of-two suffers from a rare condition called Madelung disease

After having his bandages removed for the first time, he said: 'I'm really looking forward to getting back to normal.

'I'll finally be able to go for a beer with friends without people turning their heads and pointing at me.

'My family were really surprised how well I looked when they came to visit me in the hospital after the operation.'

The tumour was caused by a rare condition called Madelung disease, which causes fatty tumours to grow around the neck.

The retired plumber said: 'I'll finally be able to go for a beer with friends without people turning their heads and pointing at me'. Right, as a young man before the condition took hold

The retired plumber rarely left his house as people would give him funny looks in the street and he would struggle to move his head properly.

'Gradually, my face began to swell. I had to stay at home for years,' he said.

Mr Zoleik added: 'Everybody was turning and looking at me. It was very unpleasant. It also bothered me all the time when I moved my head.

'The doctors wanted to make the operation much earlier, but they couldn't because of the problems with my legs.'

Igor Homola, the surgeon who removed the tumour, described it as 'very rare' and added: 'The tumour can not be removed completely and may even return.'
