The author of House of Cards has accused the BBC of 'organisational and intellectual arrogance' and said it is run 'more like a private fiefdom than a public service'.

Lord Michael Dobbs, who wrote the novel turned into series for the BBC and Netflix, said: ‘There is a real danger of the BBC being brought low by a hundred headlines, a thousand unnecessary taxi rides, and millions that have been spent on redundancies and failures. 

He said the Corporation is one of Britain's most important cultural exports, and a 'prime weapon' in its 'arsenal of soft power'.

Lord Dobbs, speaking at the Huw Wheldon Memorial Lecture, said the BBC risked being undermined by embarrassing spending scandals and its failure to own up to its mistakes

But, according to Lord Dobbs: 'That doesn't mean giving the BBC a blank cheque, or refraining from giving it a good kicking when it deserves it, but it does mean making sure it has the opportunity, and the encouragement, to meet its ambition of doubling its global audience to half a billion people in the next seven years.

'A vibrant system of public service broadcasting that is part of our future, not just a glorious past.

'If we didn't have the BBC, how much would we be willing to pay, to invent it?

'The BBC is a little like the monarchy. Impossible to measure how much she earns for the country, but we know it's immense.'

Delivering the Royal Television Society's Huw Wheldon Memorial Lecture, Lord Dobbs warned that the BBC's standing is being undermined by embarrassing spending scandals, and its failure to own up to its mistakes.

'There is a real danger of the BBC being brought low by a hundred headlines, a thousand unnecessary taxi rides, and millions that have been spent on redundancies and failures,' he said.

'There's a sense amongst many opinion formers that the BBC … has too often in recent years slipped into both organisational and intellectual arrogance. The criticism in many instances is well-founded.

'It's often very, very good at news. Equally often, it's terrible at self-criticism….It ducked away from broadcasting its own inquiries into the Savile scandal, leaving that to ITV.'

Lord Dobbs, a former chief of staff for the Conservative Party, wrote House of Cards in 1989. It was adapted for the BBC a year later, before being reinvented by Netflix as a big-budget series starring Kevin Spacey.

During the lecture he also accused the BBC of a left-wing bias in some of its reporting.

'Too often and for too long the BBC has implied that anyone who wanted to question immigration policies must be racist,' he said.

'The BBC has an institutional bias in favour of the European Union and all its works,' he added. 'It has taken sides in an ongoing debate. That's been acknowledged in report after independent report.'

Earlier this month, Huw Wheldon's reputation as one of the BBC's most respected broadcasters was tarnished, after a book claimed he regularly molested women.
