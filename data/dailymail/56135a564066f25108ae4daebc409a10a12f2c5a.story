A fourth victim has died after a man shot his wife, grown children and then himself at the family's home in California on New Year's Day, police said on Friday. 

Officers responded late on January 1 to a 911 call from a man saying he killed his family, Modesto police spokeswoman Heather Graves said.

They found two men and a woman dead inside the house. The man's daughter was found alive and underwent surgery but she later died.

Stephen Mingham, 57, reportedly shot his 56-year-old wife, Janet Mingham, 33-year-old son, Chad Mingham; and 34-year-old daughter, Nicole Mingham.

The initial investigation revealed that Stephen Mingham then shot himself. Graves said that police haven't determined the motive for the murder-suicide.

'Neighbors didn't have any indication anything was wrong,' a police investigator said. A neighbor also said that they were just a 'normal family', according to reports. 

The four were alone in the home at the time of the fatal shootings, according to the Modesto Bee. All four family members lived at the home, according to court records. 

Mrs Mingham worked as a secretary at the local Roosevelt Junior High where the district superintendent said they were 'devastated' by her death.

Grief counselors were being provided for students and staff when they returned to classes on January 12. 

Modesto is a city of 200,000 people about 70 miles southeast of Sacramento.
