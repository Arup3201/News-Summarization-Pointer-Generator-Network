The residents of a New Zealand retirement village have proven that despite any aching joints and stiff hips their dancing shoes are as good as new by creating their own version of Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy.

The 60 residents and staff from the Diana Isaac Retirement Village in Christchurch, have received over a million views of their video clip, 80 Odd Years Of Happy, which mimics the moves and scenes created by Pharrell himself.

David King, a spokesperson for Ryman Healthcare which manages the village, told Daily Mail Australia that the video was made to show resident's children and grandchildren, exactly what their loved ones are made of.

The residents of Ryman Health Care's nursing homes are encouraged to keep active with activities that include training for and performing flash mobs at local shopping centres

Mr King said that residents frequently trained for and performed flash mobs in their local supermarkets as part of their exercise regime.

'We do flash mobs around the country at malls where the residents hide and we play the music and then they all come rushing in and start dancing,' Mr King said.

'In our biggest recent one, the performers had a combined age of about 4,800 and the oldest person was 92 years old.'

The idea for 80 Odd Years Of Happy was inspired by flash mob performers who were unhappy that the song only lasted for four minutes and wanted to work on something longer

'It's just about them having fun and being part of the community and keeping fit.'
