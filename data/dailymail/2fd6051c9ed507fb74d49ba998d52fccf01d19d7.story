Santi Cazorla caught the eye with his outstanding performance in Arsenal's 2-0 victory against Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday.

But the Spain international's most unusual contribution to the game arguably occurred when everyone was looking elsewhere.

As he whipped a free-kick into City's penalty area for Olivier Giroud to head in Arsenal's second goal, he started dancing on the spot as the ball hit the back of the net.

Thankfully, a camera caught him jiving away as Arsenal's lead was extended.

Cazorla's dance finishes just as defender Nacho Monreal gets over to him to celebrate the second goal that secured Arsenal a valuable three points.

Monreal was fouled by City captain Vincent Kompany in the penalty area for Arsenal's first goal, with the spot kick converted by Cazorla.
