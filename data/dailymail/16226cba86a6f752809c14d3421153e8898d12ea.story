Daniel Perry took his own life after he was blackmailed by people online - who told him they would show compromising pictures to his family unless he gave them money

The death of a Scottish teenager who took his own life after he was blackmailed online has led to the arrest of a Filipino gang who duped hundreds of victims in to exposing themselves on the internet.

Daniel Perry, 17, a mechanic from Fife, jumped off a bridge when people online threatened to send compromising images of him to his family and friends unless he paid them.

Daniel's death prompted a large-scale police inquiry by investigators from Interpol, the US Department of Homeland Security, plus police Scotland and other forces.

Now, at least 58 Filipino suspects have been arrested after the investigators traced online activity from some of their victims' computers, Philippine National Police chief Allan Purisima said.

At least three of those are believed to have been directly involved in blackmailing Daniel.

Over 260 computers, phones and pornographic materials and other evidence was seized in the Philippines by 15 police teams.

Mr Purisima said the syndicate would secretly record the victims after tricking them into exposing their bodies or having cybersex.

They would then threaten to send the video to their relatives and friends unless they paid anything from $500 (£292) to $2,000 (£1,100) he said.

He added members of the group would create fake Facebook accounts of fictitious young and attractive women to entice and lure victims with pornographic materials after striking up online chats with them.

Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham, Major Crime and Public Protection, said: 'Daniel's death last year led to a major criminal inquiry which ultimately led officers to the Philippines.

'The enforcement action over the past two days by the Philippines National Police has been supported by Police Scotland.

'We have had officers in Manila observing and assisting in the past few days, working with a wide range of partners including Interpol, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Philippines National Police and CEOP and law enforcement from other countries.

Daniel's death led to a large-scale international investigation - which saw 58 Filipinos arrested this week. Officials say those arrested are believed to have posed as attractive women online to lure people in

'Our message is clear: Our focus is on keeping people safe and there is no hiding place - anywhere in the world - if you are a criminal and you undertake this type of activity, which preys on those who might be the most vulnerable and susceptible to coercion and blackmail.

'A young Scottish teenager lost his life as a result of this online activity. The impact on his family, friends and wider community cannot be imagined.

'I hope that the efforts of law enforcement and our partners in Scotland and globally helps to provide some reassurance to Daniel's family and the wider public that we are determined to tackle this type of criminality.'

Detective Chief Inspector Gary Cunningham, of Specialist Crime Division Major Investigation Team East, led the investigation into Daniel's death.

He travelled to Manila to liaise with the authorities in the Philippines. He said: 'Daniel was a victim of a crime which uses threat and intimidation to coerce people into parting with money.

At least of three of those arrested by the team - which included members from Interpol - are believed to have been involved in victimising Daniel, pictured. 260 computers and scores of pornographic material was seized in 15 raids of suspects in the past week

'This is an organised criminal activity, which is there for one reason - to generate profit by exploiting the vulnerability of others.

'It's an abhorrent crime and in this case a young man lost his life, which is something his family and friends have to live with. We have been thorough and relentless in our pursuit of answers to why Daniel died.'

Sanjay Virmani, director the Interpol 
Digital Crime Center based in Singapore, said the victims were from the 
Asia, Europe and the United States.

He said that the extortionists had been tracked down using evidence from computers and intelligence information from police.

A police spokesman said the impact on Daniel's family 'cannot be imagined' - but that he hoped the arrested would provide 'reassurance' to those who knew him

Warning
 those still engaged in cyber extortion in the Philippines and elsewhere
 in the world, Virmani said: 'You better be prepared for the 
consequences of your actions because as you can see we have made a 
commitment to work together.

'You will be caught and you will be held accountable for your actions.'

'This is not an issue directly involving the Philippines exclusively,' British Ambassador to Manila Asif Ahmad said.

'Cybercrime
 is international, and is an international problem, it respects no 
nationality or borders. We are all potential victims of cybercrime, none
 of us are immune.'
