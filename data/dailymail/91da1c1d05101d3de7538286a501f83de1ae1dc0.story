The re-birth of a river after years of drought has been captured on camera in the Negev desert, Israel.

The waters of the river Zin are seen gushing down a dry riverbed, much to the delight of locals and a highly excitable dog.

It is thought the return of the flood 
waters are because of heavy rain in mountainous regions several miles 
away from the arid land.

The re-birth of a river Zin after years of drought has been captured on camera in the Negev desert in Israel  (pictured). For centuries the dry area, which is a massive creek bed, has seen the disappearance and return of water in a series of flash floods

The region of the Wadi Zim, in the Negev desert is flooded every few years (pictured by this stock image) and has been since Biblical times. The Negev desert is where 12 spies are said to have been sent by Moses to travel the Promised Land and the Zin river used to mark the border of Israel in Biblical times

The Negev (or Negeb) takes its name from the Hebrew neghev, meaning dry.

Beersheba was a major crossroads for Abraham in the Old Testament.

According to the Bible he arrived in the area 3,700 years ago dug a well to feed his flock and established a settlement for his people.

The desert is the scene of many biblical events and was a place of exile and a wilderness.

The Israelites wandered the Negev during the 'wilderness journey' after the Exodus.

river used to mark the border of Israel in Biblical times

The occasional flooding of the Negev is mentioned in the Old testament.

For centuries the dry area, which is a massive creek bed, has seen the disappearance and return of water in a series of flash floods, Examiner.com reported.

The landscape is dramatic in places with plunging canyons and meandering dusty paths, which cause small waterfalls and the water to ride over the bumpy, dusty terrain.

The wave is impressive considering it is caused by rainfall miles away, and it does not take long for a convincing stream that gushes down holes in the rock to appear, strengthening all the time.

The appearance of the river is highly 
unpredictable and it has been years since enough rainfall has caused a 
flash flood in the desert, experts said.

The river Zin's source (pictured) is upon the slopes of the Ramon Crater - a geological feature located at the peak of Mount Negev, some 52miles (85 km) south of the city of Beersheba  - and it ends in the Dead Sea

However, locals have strange methods for predicting its return, as is shown by people waiting for the waves to show in the video.

Meanwhile, companies that run jeep tours of the region to point out Biblical sights advise visitors to check the weather forecast in case a flood is imminent.

The Negev desert is a dry and desolate land during the high summer months, but in the winter, rain falls on higher ground, such as the nearby ancient city of Beersheba.

Rains that continue until around April can accumulate on high ground and lead to the flooding of the dry river bed below.

The pattern of events is even described in the Old Testament of the Bible.

The river’s source is upon the slopes of the Ramon Crater - a geological feature located at the peak of Mount Negev, some 52miles (85 km) south of the city of Beersheba  - and it ends in the Dead Sea.

It is not an impact crater from a meteor, but is the world’s largest makhtesh - a  type of geological feature unique to the region = and measures 24miles (40km) long, between one mile and six miles (2km and 10km) wide and up to 1,640ft (500m) deep. It is intriguingly shaped like an elongated heart.

The Negev desert is where 12 spies are said to have been sent by Moses to travel the Promised Land and the Zin river used to mark the border of Israel in Biblical times.

The riverbed of the river Zin is made of hard, white chalk.
