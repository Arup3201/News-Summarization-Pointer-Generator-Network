At the age of 81, Sir Michael Caine says he's ready to retire from acting

From Zulu to the Italian Job and Get Carter, he has starred in some of Britain’s most famous films.

But at the age of 81, it seems Sir Michael Caine may be ready to call it a day.

The actor has revealed he has ‘probably retired’ and will not make another film unless he is sent a script he cannot refuse.

Speaking to BBC2’s Newsnight, Sir Michael said his latest film Youth, in which he stars alongside Harvey Keitel and Rachel Weisz, is likely to be his last.

He said: ‘I have no ambitions now… all I do is, I do films that I really want to do.

‘If I don’t get a script – which I don’t have – that entices me out, I’ll be done in December when I do the last picture, the last script I’ve got.

‘I always went into every movie with an aim. It was either to get an Oscar or make money, that’s the two reasons I do movies. I’ve got two Oscars and I’ve got some money so I’m alright.’

At a charity night at the Royal Albert Hall to honour his long career, Sir Michael dropped further hints that his film days may be over, saying: ‘I’ve probably retired now but I go home and there will be a great script and I think ‘oh I’ll do one more’. I look to see if it challenges me.’

Sir Michael first shot to fame in 1964’s Zulu, in which he had to mask his Cockney accent to play an upper class British officer.

Recalling the moment he was cast, he said: ‘I was due to play the cockney corporal but they said can you do a posh accent? The funny thing with the English class system is I bet an English director wouldn’t have given me that part but being American he didn’t know the system.

‘They said to me: “I’ve seen you a lot on screen now and you look gay - to Americans, English officers look gay.” But it was funny because then I got nominated for an Academy Award for Alfie who was screwing every woman who could.’

Since then, Sir Michael has appeared in more than 100 films and won two Oscars, a Golden Globe and a Bafta.

In some of his best remembered roles he has played criminals and gangsters, such as in The Italian Job and Get Carter.

He enjoyed a career resurgence in the 1990s after having practically retired from acting, and has been nominated for an Oscar in every decade since the 1960s.

However, Sir Michael said he was uncomfortable with being labelled a national treasure. He said: ‘You don’t know what to do when you’re a National Treasure you don’t have a special restaurant you can go to called National Treasures you don’t do a course in it, I just live my life.’

He added: ‘I didn’t set out to be a movie star or rich and famous that would have been a stupid idea for a Cockney boy. I set out to be the best actor I could ever be. I never get television scripts, I get so many movie scripts, I love movies.’
