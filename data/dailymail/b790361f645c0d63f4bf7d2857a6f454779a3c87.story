A 23-year-old rugby captain with a ‘concerning attitude’ towards Asian women was told that he had brought shame on his club and parents after exposing a young student's bottom outside a party.

Andrew MacDonald, full-back for RBS Regional West League side Strathendrick, grabbed the woman as she made her way to a waiting bus after the event at The Black Bull pub in Killearn, Stirlingshire.

MacDonald hoisted the slightly-built 21-year-old onto his shoulder in ‘a fireman's lift’ and then pulled her dress up her back - revealing her buttocks to a group of his friends - and spun her round.

Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told MacDonald at Stirling Sheriff Court today that he acted in a way that was ‘nothing short of disgraceful’, telling him he was an ‘embarrassment’ to his parents.

The sheriff also criticised him for ‘lying in the witness box’ and not being able to ‘control himself and act in a civilised way’ after drinking.

He said: ‘You now accept you lifted up her skirt deliberately to amuse your friends and of course you lied in the witness box and made this girl go through giving evidence and cross examination.

‘Your behaviour was nothing short of disgraceful. You are no doubt an embarrassment to your parents. That night you took away that young girl's dignity, you left her distressed by what you did.

‘I find it's not the first time you acted in a sexual and criminal way. Your criminal record, while short, is concerning. You have been convicted of drink-driving and sexually abusing a young women.

‘You have a concerning attitude towards Asian women as an Asian girl was involved in the first case. You also have a conviction for acting in a racist way.

‘If they are the qualities that qualified
you as captain of Strathendrick Rugby Club, what does that say about 
the club and the people associated? 

‘You have shamed your club. You have an alcohol problem. You are unable to control yourself or act in a civilised way when you have drink’.

During the trial, the woman said she started ‘screaming’ after MacDonald picked her up.

She said after he lifted her skirt she felt a ‘breeze’ on her bottom, adding: ‘I was really terrified. He picked me up. He lifted my skirt.’

MacDonald, an accounts manager, of Fintry, Stirlingshire, was found guilty of indecent assault - a charge he had denied.

His solicitor, Harry Coughlan, said: ‘He 
had a good day, and was high of spirits after success at sport, he had 
taken some drink and accepts he acted in the matter liable.

‘He did not realise that his actions 
caused so much upset and he regrets that, he never intended to cause 
harm to his victim, he gave no thought to the consequences. He was known
as the class clown in school’.

Sentencing him to 200 hours unpaid work and placing him under two years supervision, Sheriff Robertson said: ‘This conviction alone would not warrant a prison sentence.

‘But with your previous convictions and the way you acted a custodial sentence has to be considered.

‘I am bound to look at the alternatives and I will consider a community payback order with supervision of a social worker for two years and also 300 hours unpaid work in the community’.

MacDonald refused to comment outside court.
