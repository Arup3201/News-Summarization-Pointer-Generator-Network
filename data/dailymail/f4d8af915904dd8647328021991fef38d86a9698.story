'We never doubted each other,' he told reporters. 'That's what it took. That was a great football team we beat.

'It was a lot of mental toughness. Every team has a journey and a lot of people lost faith in us early. But we held strong. We held together.'

Brady, Montana and Terry Bradshaw are now the only starting quarterbacks to earn four Super Bowl titles.
