Parents of a 10-year-old cystic fibrosis sufferer who is too young to receive a life-saving transplant have asked the public directly to help save their daughter's life.

Janet and Fran Murnaghan pleaded to the public in a statement Sunday for a lung donation from any family able to give it to their daughter Sarah.

'Essentially, Sarah has been left to die,' Sarah's parents said in the statement, according to the New York Daily News.

Battle: Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan has been on the waiting list for a lung transplant for 18 months

The Murnaghans issued the call-to-arms after unsuccessful efforts by Health and Human 
Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to help Sarah.

Though Sebelius asked for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation 
Network to review the policy on lung allocation in a letter Friday, according to The Associated Press, she did not override it.

'Secretary Sebelius' decision to not exercise her very clear authority under 
the law to intervene and mandate a variance that would help save Sarah's life is 
devastating,' Sarah's parents said in the statement according to the Daily News.

Sarah, from Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, was born with cystic fibrosis and she now lives at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia as her lungs continue to deteriorate.

She relies on a ventilator to breathe and has been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months - and is top of the priority list for children in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia 
and northern Virginia.

But so far, none have become available - and because she falls two years below the cut off for adult lungs, she can do nothing but wait. She has been given just three to five weeks to live.

Celebration: Sarah and her mom Janet are celebrating after a federal judge overruled a law preventing children under 12 from receiving adult organs

Her parents learned just weeks ago that Sarah would be given a better chance if she were waiting for adult lungs, which are reserved for people aged 12 or over.

If an adult's lung was modified, it would work perfectly, CNN reported.

Instead she must wait for a child's lung, which are in much shorter supply; in 2012, there were just 10 transplants for Sarah's age group, but more than 1,700 for adults,  according to the United Network for Organ Sharing.

Her mother called it 'insane'.

'It shouldn't be about their age,' she told CNN. 'If she's the sickest person, she should qualify.'

Emotional: Before Wednesday's reprieve Mom Janet had said she refused to tell her young daughter just how sick she really is

Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan filed an emergency motion for the temporary restraining order on Wednesday morning, the day after U.S. health secretary Sebelius had turned down their appeals

The system determining who is allocated lungs for transplants was overhauled in 2004 and again in 2008. Doctors claim the changes have allowed fewer people on the waiting list to die.

The changes meant that lung transplants are allocated by age groups. Those over the age of 12 are given an allocation score based on how urgently they need a transplant and the severity of their medical condition. Those who would benefit most are placed highest and given first priority.

For children under 12, lungs are only allocated based on the time they've spent on the list.

One problem is that there are few pediatric lungs available for transplant. In 2012, there were just 10 transplants for Sarah's age group, but more than 1,700 for adults,  according to the United Network for Organ Sharing.

'The law is, in my view, age discrimination,' she added to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'I don't know if this is too late to make a difference for Sarah. But we'll keep fighting it.'

Dr. Stuart Sweet from St. Louis Children's
 Hospital, who helped write the pediatric transplant system, said the case 'tugs at his heart' but that no system is perfect.

He said that if he changed the system for Sarah's advantage, 'there's
 another patient, very likely an adolescent, who gets a disadvantage'.

'We've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible,' he contended.

Her parents are hopeful that the issue can be beaten by someone stepping forward with a direct donation to Sarah.

For now, they have decided not to tell Sarah, who is the eldest of four siblings, just how sick she is.

'I'm not going to tell her she's dying, because she's 10,' Janet told CNN.

'I'm going to tell her we're going to keep fighting. I don't want to scare her.'

Support: Sarah, who has been living in hospital since February, is pictured with her three younger siblings

Sisterly: Despite her poor prognosis, Sarah remains upbeat about her chances of getting a transplant

Holding on: Sarah's mother said her eldest daughter has just three to five weeks left to live

Sarah, who has been outside just twice in the last 100 days, said that she misses school, where she could 'at least try and act like all the other normal children'.

But even as her lungs deteriorate, the young girl remains positive, certain that she will beat her illness and be granted a lung transplant.

'We will [get them]!' she said. 'I can't wait to take my first breath with new lungs. I can close my eyes right now and imagine it... I'm never going to quit! Never, never!'
