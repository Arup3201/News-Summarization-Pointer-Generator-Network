The family of a Sydney mother-of-two, who was charged with adultery in Lebanon, said pictures of her wedding to a man she had only known for two days proved she was a bigamist.

Mahassen Issa, 29, said she travelled to Lebanon on June 20 when she met her boyfriend Mohammad Awick, after separating from her husband.

Ms Issa was due to return to Sydney last weekend but said she was contacted by police and told she had been charged with adultery, which is a criminal offence in Lebanon and carried a six-month prison sentence.

But one of Ms Issa's family members tells a different version of her troubles with the law, claiming she had in fact been charged with bigamy after she married Mr Awick in Lebanon three weeks ago.

'She’s disregarded her kids and disregarded her family, and gone off and married someone she had only known for 48 hours,' the family said.

'She didn’t tell us she was getting married. The photos we have were shared on Facebook.'

Ms Issa's relative said the family had warned Ms Issa about marrying Mr Awick after her ex-husband registered their marriage in Lebanon.

'We tried to put a stop to it but she decided to proceed with her marriage in Lebanon...now it has backfired on her,' the relative told Daily Mail Australia.

'She's not going to jail because of adultery, she's going to jail because she got married while she was still married.

'That's illegal everywhere, not just in Lebanon. All she's doing is crying out for Australia to help her.'

But Ms Issa protests her innocence, saying she and her estranged husband were in the middle of divorce proceedings in Australia.

'I came to Lebanon because I was going through a very messy divorce, I met my partner, we fell in love,' she told 9NEWS.

'I haven't broken any laws and I'm a victim of a jealous spouse's revenge plot.'

A relative of Ms Issa's husband told The Daily Telegraph that he was the one who informed Lebanese authorities on Ms Issa.

Adultery is a crime in Lebanon, though with very different consequences for men and women.

For a man to be convicted of adultery, he must commit the adulterous act in the marital home or the affair must be known about publicly. Whereas a woman can be convicted if she commits the act anywhere.

A man can be found guilty if there is not enough material evidence of the affair, such as love letters. But a woman can be found guilty based on witness testimony.

Men who are convicted of adultery face between one month and one year in prison, whereas women face between three months and two years in jail for the same crime.

The female partner of an adulterer is subject to punishment regardless of her maritalstatus, whereas the male partner of an adulteress is not subject to any punishment unless he is also married.

Finally, charges of adultery can be dropped against men who resume conjugal relations with their wives, but there is not the same provision for women.

'Women are still considered second and third grade citizen, they have a long way to go to achieve equality in the Middle East,' said Dr Eman Sharobeem, director of the Immigrant Women's Health Service.

'It’s a male-dominated environment where women struggle to make a stand for themselves and their family.'Ms Issa was informed by authorities that her passport had been flagged and she was not able to leave the country.

He also said that the families of Ms Issa and her husband hoped she received a jail sentence and were 'very happy that she's getting charged and she's getting what she deserves'.

Ms Issa's relatives have disowned her over the incident.

'The family has disowned her, we want nothing to do with her. She is a compulsive liar,' the family member told Daily Mail Australia.

'We told her not to get married three weeks ago, we told her she would get in trouble and look what happened.'

Ms Issa who was born in Sydney and attended Wiley Park High School has two children, aged six and nine, and she said she fears not being able to return to them.

'The thought of not seeing my children again and my whole family disowning me, it's too much,' she said.

The children are currently being cared for by their father in Sydney's west.

Ms Issa says she separated from her husband in September last year, though her husband claims they did not separate until April 2014.

Ms Issa said that she and Mr Awick have been receiving threats and she does not know who to turn to for assistance.

'The holiday that I thought would just be some time out has turned into a nightmare… we have done nothing wrong,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

Ms Issa faced court today and has been assisted by the Australian Consulate General in Beirut and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

'The Australian Embassy in Beirut is providing consular assistance to an Australian woman who is seeking to depart Lebanon to return to Australia,' a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia.

'It is important to bear in mind that Australians travelling overseas are subject to the laws of the countries they are in, just as citizens of other countries are subject to Australian laws when they are here.'

Ms Issa said she and Mr Awick have received threats and are fearful of what their futures hold

Dr Eman Sharobeem, director of the Immigrant Women's Health Service, said that as long as other nations have laws that do not protect women, Australian citizens should not be subject to those laws.

'She's an Australian woman, our government should intervene to bring her back,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'Some nations allow girls to marriage at ages as young as six, would we consider these girls when they come to Australia as married? Are they victims of child abuse or child brides?

'So as long as we don't have clear vision on the law to protect women and to protect our citizens, the Australian government should intervene immediately. She should be returned to Australia and then Australian law should look into the situation,' said Dr Sharobeem.
