A father claims that a group of students broke into his house and had a raucous party when he was on holiday – and the party goers appear to have posted pictures of their unwelcome get-together on Facebook.

The 39-year-old, who did not want to be named, said he and his family returned to their home after a vacation and noticed nothing untoward until pictures began to surface online.

‘I'm looking at them like, “Wait, this is my house!” They are running around doing lewd things with funnels, throwing up in the sink, passed out on the kitchen floor,’ the man told WCNC news.

The man recognised the teenagers in the photographs as one of his children’s classmates. He added that the uninvited guests told his son that the party happened around July 4 – when the family were away on a trip to New York.

After seeing the photos on the social networking site, the family spotted that a screen to an unlocked window appeared to have been wrenched up.

But none of them spotted any damage to the house in Tega Cay, South Carolina, and only became aware of the party three months after their return when the pictures appeared online.

In the pictures posted on Facebook, one man is seen parading round the house with a funnel. In another photograph, the group of revellers are posing with drinks in the living room.

The party didn't look to have been limited to just the living area either. There is a picture of a topless teenage boy giving a thumbs up while perched on the edge of one of the beds.

A more graphic picture seems to show one of the group leaning over the sink, again without a shirt on, vomiting into the basin.

‘The kids came back the next day and cleaned everything up, I guess. They even did the dishes.

'If someone hadn't been bragging by posting on Facebook, no one ever would have known. They wouldn't have been caught,’ said the father.

Upon spotting the photos, the man turned the evidence over to the local police department and, thanks to the tagged pictures, officers have a complete list of suspects and are attempting to reach them.

No charges have been brought yet, but the Tega Cay Police Department consider it to be an active investigation.

The father added: ‘You just feel completely violated. How do you know when I am not around, and the little kids are home, when they could come do this or someone could come into your house.

‘It makes you feel pretty vulnerable.’
