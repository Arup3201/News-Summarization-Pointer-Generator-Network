The mother of 19-year-old cancer victim Stephen Sutton has said she is 'immensely proud' of her son after it was revealed he raised almost £5million for charity.

He inspired the biggest ever fundraiser the Teenage Cancer Trust has ever seen and became a household name with his 46-item bucket list.

The teenager from Burntwood, Staffordshire, was diagnosed with bowel cancer at 15, but he approached the disease with good humour and stoicism.

The 19-year-old helped raise almost £5million for cancer research charities after his struggle with bowel cancer went viral 

His mother Jane Sutton said: 'My son Stephen was courageous and inspirational. His selfless fundraising and positive attitude touched people across the world and the huge outpouring of love and support he received in return was humbling.

'Stephen believed that every young person with cancer has an inspiring story to tell and I know that so many young people in the same position as Stephen also fundraise in support of Teenage Cancer Trust. 

'Stephen was passionate about supporting Teenage Cancer Trust, a charity that helped him understand that 'he may have had cancer but cancer didn't have him'.

'This money will make a significant difference to other young people with cancer and that would have made Stephen very happy.

His 'weird and wonderful' bucket list included skydiving and organising a charity gig 

'Stephen showed us how incredibly powerful even very small positive acts can be when lots of people get involved. I'm immensely proud of everything he achieved. We will never forget Stephen, and his positivity will live on through Stephen's Story for Teenage Cancer Trust.'

After being told the cancer was incurable in 2012, he drew up a list of 'weird and wonderful' things he wanted to do before he died.

He spent the next two years achieving the vast majority of them, including playing the drums in front of a crowd of 90,000 at  Wembley, skydiving and writing a book.

By the time he died in May this year, he had already raised more than £3million, exceeding his original £10,000 goal.

His campaign reached a huge new audience after he posted what he called 'a final Thumbs Up' on Facebook on 22 April this year, after his deteriorating condition saw him rushed to hospital. 

The post was shared by 76,000 people and his fundraising target soon tipped over the £1million mark.

His bucket list won the hearts of thousands of supporters - including Prime Minister David Cameron and comedian Jason Manford. 

The money raised will go towards funding new  teenage cancer units at seven NHS hospitals in England and Scotland, and the foundation of 50 Stephen Sutton Scholarships to train specialist cancer nurses.

It will also pay for 1,500 teenage cancer patients to attend special events to learn, share experiences and make friends with others in their situation.

In a YouTube video, the teenager from Burntwood, Staffordshire, spoke of how he did not want 'to be remembered as someone who didn't fulfil their potential'.

And despite not being able to become a doctor, he had stuck to his 'core purpose' of helping others. 

Teenage Cancer Trust chief exectuive Siobhan Dunn said: 'Stephen trusted us to spend the money well and to 'keep doing what we do' and this is reflected in our plans. However, Stephen has also allowed us to be more ambitious.

'Stephen's Story will help us reach some huge milestones for young people with cancer across the UK but we know that for every young person we can help, there's another we can't so there remains much more to do.

'Stephen's gift to a charity of our size is more than money - the awareness raised of cancer in young people and new supporters inspired by Stephen will be essential if we are to help every young person with cancer who needs us.'

His most important goal on the bucket list was to raise £10,000, but he also visited Number 10 Downing Street
