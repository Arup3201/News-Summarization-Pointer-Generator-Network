The Duchess of Cambridge has some serious power with millions of women desperate to emulate her.

And now, with the number of new mothers attempting to breastfeed falling in England for the first time in almost a decade, one woman wants the Duchess of Cambridge to help reignite the trend.

TV and radio presenter Beverley Turner wants Kate to use her position of power to help encourage women to breastfeed their babies.

We need you, Kate! Beverley Turner has spoken out about the fall in women breastfeeding and wants the Duchess of Cambridge to set a trend

Writing an outspoken piece for The Telegraph, she said: 'We need women with power and influence to get their milky bosoms out and feed smiling in paparazzi pictures.

'Celebrity is depressingly powerful in dictating trends.

'As if there wasn’t enough pressure on her already, what we really need is The Duchess of Cambridge to get her Royal orbs out to feed our future monarch. And to be applauded – not seethed at – for doing so.'

About 5,700 fewer women started breastfeeding their babies in 2012-13 compared to the year before and Beverley, who has a son with Olympic rower James Cracknell, wants to make a change.

She believes that breastfeeding is rapidly losing any sense of normality because of powerful cultural forces.

She writes that young mothers aren't willing to breastfeed because they don't deem it 'cool' or 'sexy' and think their boyfriends won't like it.

It is unclear whether the Duchess of Cambridge will breastfeed but she will move back in with her mother when her baby is born.

In a break with royal tradition, Kate, 31, will not employ a maternity nurse after the July birth.

Instead, she has told friends, she will live with her parents for at least the first six weeks after leaving hospital.

The decision means a future monarch 
will be starting life in a commoner’s home in Berkshire rather than in 
the splendour of a royal residence.

Kate
says she ‘just feels safest and most secure’ with her family and 
believes that no one could be better placed to teach her about bringing 
up a baby than her mother, who has three children of her own.

She
will particularly need her advice and moral support when Prince William
returns to work as a helicopter pilot after taking his paternity leave.

This isn't the first time that Beverley has written about controversial issues.

Previous topics she has covered for the site include: Why Britain shouldn't have baby name police, 'It's time to toughen up the kids. Start terrifying them' and 'What's worse than promiscuous teens? 40-year-old virgins'.
