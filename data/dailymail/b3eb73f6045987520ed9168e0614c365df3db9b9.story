Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's speech at Georgetown University today was met with tepid enthusiasm from students, with just half of seats in the reception hall appearing to be filled.

Pictures and video discovered by the Daily Caller show empty clusters throughout the 750-seat auditorium in which she spoke as part of a security conference being held at the Washington, D.C. university.

This is at least the second time in recent weeks that Clinton has been unable to pack a room during an appearance just as the clock winds down for her to make a decision about whether she wants to carry her political party's torch in 2016.

In late October Clinton served as the headliner at a rally for Maryland Lt. Governor Anthony Brown, who was campaigning to become the Bay State's chief executive at the time, at the University of Maryland's College Park campus.

After the event was over, Brown's staff claimed that more than a 1,000 supporters came out to see Clinton, but it was evident that there were far fewer attendees, as most of the nose-bleed seats on one side of the gymnasium were empty, as were areas of the bleachers on the side.

Clinton spent a good deal of her time throughout the fall barnstorming the country, attempting to save embattled Senate Democrats from electoral defeat.

Today denoted one of just a few non-political speeches she's given since, and she is slated to make remarks at two events in January and February.

Her Feb. 24 speech at the first-ever Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women has raised eyebrows among politicos as Clinton has repeatedly promised to make an announcement about her political future at the top of the year.

Once she declares her candidacy for president - if she intends to at all - it would be frowned upon for her to continue charging business executives upward of $200,000 for a slice of her time.

The recently announced February speaking date indicates that Clinton may wait until early spring to make her decision public.

Polls continue to show Clinton atop the 2016 field should she follow through on a second presidential run.

A CNN survey released on Tuesday shows her decimating her competition in the Democratic primary and earning 65 percent of her party's support.

Democrats' second choice, progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, received just 10 percent of the vote in the hypothetical match up. 

Trailing Warren were Vice President Joe Biden at nine percent and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at five percent.

Coming in at just one percent were New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, retiring Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.

Without Clinton in the race, Biden, a former Delaware senator, would jump to the top of a plurality of Democrats' wish lists, followed by Warren, with all other possible contenders failing to earn double-digit support.
