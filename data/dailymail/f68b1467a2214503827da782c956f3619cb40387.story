Concerns: MP Patrick Mercer¿s views reflect growing concern within the Tory party about the proposals

Secret court hearings will hand a major propaganda victory to terrorists, a former security adviser to David Cameron has warned.

Senior Tory MP Patrick Mercer said he had ‘grave’ concerns about the Government’s plans, which he warned would erode centuries of open justice.

The former Army officer, who served as the party’s homeland security spokesman until 2007, also claimed the measures would succeed in destroying British values – effectively doing the  terrorists’ job for them.

He pointed out that Britain had successfully fought tyrannies throughout history without having to resort to secret court hearings.

Mr Mercer’s views reflect growing concern within the Tory party about the proposals, which extend ‘closed material procedures’ – ensuring cases are conducted behind closed doors – to any civil or inquest hearing.

The comments came as it emerged ministers are preparing to backtrack over plans to allow ministers to decide which hearings can be conducted in secret.

Mr Mercer said: ‘My grave difficulty with this – particularly in cases of counter terrorism and security – is that any changes to what we have at the moment will erode the very thing for which we are fighting: freedom of speech, and free and open trials which are an immensely important element of British justice.

‘It is an element with which we fought tyrannies successfully down the years. We countered Nazism, communism and Irish republicanism without having to resort to these sort of measures.

'The point about terrorism and subversion is that it endeavours to change the way we live our lives and the tenets upon which we base our justice. ‘By imposing these changes  upon ourselves, we are doing the subversives’ jobs for them.’

Open: The Royal Courts of Justice, London. A U-turn by ministers would be a significant step in the fight to maintain transparency in the British justice system, ruling out plans to allow inquests to be held in secret

Mr Mercer also drew comparisons with the Diplock courts in Northern Ireland, where cases were heard by a single judge without a jury.

‘While they satisfied the short term desire to put some terrorists behind bars, they laid us open to accusations of injustice and authoritarianism – the very things we were fighting,’ he added.

‘They eventually ceased to operate because the propaganda value they handed to our opponents outweighed the usefulness of the product.

I strongly suspect, having got as far as
 we have in the so-called war against terror, that to apply these 
changes to terrorist cases will be to shoot ourselves in the foot.’

Mr Mercer’s remarks are another blow to the Government’s plans to extend ‘secret justice’.

The Lib Dems and Labour are refusing to 
back the proposals as they stand, meaning the draft Bill appears to have
 no chance of becoming law.

The Daily Mail has led criticism of plans for more secret courts as an affront to traditions of open justice.

As the debate has grown increasingly fractious, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke and Home Secretary Theresa May have issued a last-ditch letter to Tory MPs to boost support for the plans.

The Cabinet ministers have been accused of making ‘spurious’ claims that failing to back secret courts would lead to terror suspects being granted British passports.

They have also claimed that U.S. spies have been holding back on sharing information with Britain for fear it would end up in open court – a claim disputed by some security sources in Washington.

Under the plans in the Justice and Security green paper, defendants or claimants would not be allowed to be present, know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security-cleared advocate rather than their own lawyer.

Parliament’s joint committee on human rights has produced a report damning the plans as ‘inherently unfair and dangerous’.

Senior sources have revealed that Mr Clarke is looking at backing away from allowing secret justice hearings in all but a ‘tiny’ number of terrorism cases.
