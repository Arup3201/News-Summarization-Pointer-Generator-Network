Failed
Nigerian asylum seeker Anthony Harrison, 32, used bizarre rituals to trap children into sex slavery

A council caretaker who smuggled two teenage girls into Britain and forced them to
work as prostitutes after they were put under a voodoo curse was jailed for 20 years.

Failed
Nigerian asylum seeker Anthony Harrison, 32, also became the first person
to be convicted of trafficking the victims out of the UK in a groundbreaking
case.

A jury at
Woolwich Crown Court unanimously convicted Harrison of a string of trafficking
charges but cleared him of two charges of rape.

The girls involved, aged 14 and 16, from Edo in Nigeria, are believed to be the first 'Juju' voodoo rites victims to give evidence in a European court.

The two
teenagers - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - underwent a series of perverse ceremonies which saw one of them
stripped naked, cut all over her body with razors and locked in a coffin for
hours.

Another
ceremony saw her forced to drink blood while yet another involved eating a
chicken's heart.

The Juju
rituals were intended to ensure the victims were 'bound' to a medicine man and
would never reveal the truth about their harrowing ordeals.

Until now, those who have undergone such rituals have refused to speak out of fear that a curse would kill them.

Harrison,
of Albert Square, Stratford, east London, worked for Newham council under the name Charles Pepple.

Passing sentence, Judge Philip Shorrock said: 'The
trafficking of young girls from rural villages in Nigeria so they can be
compelled to work as prostitutes is a vile business.

A 'black magic' wound inflicted on one of the unnamed victims smuggled into Britain by Anthony Harrison

'When they
are as young as these girls and their innocence and credulity is exploited by
subjecting them to Juju ceremonies to terrify them into obedience and silence,
it is a trade that is viler still.'

Prosecutor
Riel Karmy-Jones added: 'It is the first time the crown have been
able to persuade victims of this type of trafficking to give evidence in court.

'It is the
first time there's been a prosecution for trafficking out of the UK.'

Harrison
led a double life as a 'key player' in a people trafficking gang which used
bizarre rituals to trap the children into sex slavery.

He arrived in the UK in April 2003, claiming to be Liberian, but evidence
suggested he was actually from Nigeria.

Although
his asylum application and subsequent appeals were refused, he was granted
indefinite leave to remain under the Home Office 'Legacy' programme.

In 2009,
Harrison oversaw the smuggling of the girls  while he
worked for Newham council.

Harrison
then shipped them on to Spain and Greece to work in the sex industry.

Harrison 'controlled' his young victims using Juju witchcraft. Seen here is another injury sustained by one of the teenagers

When the
trial started, Judge Shorrock warned jurors that they would hear
evidence of terrifying voodoo rituals and gave them the chance to absent
themselves from the trial.

The case
evokes memories of the five-year-old west African boy, later identified simply
as Adam, found washed up next to the Globe Theatre in 2001 after he was
smuggled into Britain.

He had
been drugged with a 'black-magic' potion and sacrificed in a Juju ritual
killing before being thrown into the Thames.

Jurors
heard how the two girls were sold by their families in Nigeria to people
traffickers.

After
being subjected to Juju rituals in Africa, they were given 'scripts' to tell UK
immigration staff that they were claiming asylum, having been forced to flee
their country because they were accused of being lesbians.

Juju
is a form of witchcraft thought to have originated  in West Africa 
which centres  on the belief that objects can  be endowed with magical 
powers.

It is widespread in
Nigeria, where such objects are made into charms believed to have the 
power to protect people or influence events.

Many
of the practices of Juju are unknown as they are  conducted in secret, 
but are generally characterised by elaborate rituals, often involving 
animals.

It is thought the word Juju means ‘fetish’ in Hausa, a language of northern Nigeria.

Juju
travelled to the Americas from west Africa with the influx of slaves, 
and still survives in some communities that retain strong ties with 
their traditions.

In more recent times, migrant workers from the region brought Juju to Britain and other parts of Europe.

Once in
the UK, both girls were placed in care before they absconded in order to contact
their handler, Harrison.

Both girls
were from a part of Nigeria where Juju magic or medicine 'exists side by
side and in conjunction with other religions such as Christianity.'

Ms Karmy-Jones told jurors 'It is what many of us would immediately jump to
call black magic, or a kind of voodoo, but we would probably be incorrect in
that simplification,' she said.

'I am not
going to give you any huge detail, other than to say that Juju is amongst those
who believe in it considered to be very strong magic and is greatly feared.

'Both
girls were subjected to ceremonies involving this magic, although each appears
to have been quite different, and it has taken a long time - two years of
painstaking work - for the police involved in the investigation to build up
sufficient trust for these two girls to talk more openly about what happened to
them.'

Jurors heard both girls feared they would die if they exposed their
captors to UK authorities.

In a taped
interview with the 16-year-old who arrived in Britain on May 30, 2009, a female
officer is heard to ask: 'Do you still think that you're going to die from
talking to the police?' She replied: 'That's what they told me but I don't
know.

'At that
time, I believed it - even till now - because people are scared of it and they
said it kill people.

'I always believed that if I talked to the police I
will die - it was in my head. 

'It's beginning to change because the first
time I talk to the police I was waiting, I thought I was gonna die, but I was
still waiting. Until now I haven't died.'

The court heard the girl had been sold
to the trafficking gang by her uncle, who had also sexually abused her.

After
collecting the girl, Harrison made the girl sleep outside at his east London
flat.

She was
finally picked up by immigration officials in Madrid on June 20.

Later a
14-year-old girl was brought to the UK and forced to work as a prostitute out
of a spare room at Harrison's home before he attempted to pack her off to
Greece.

The
teenager was intercepted at Luton airport.

Giving
evidence, Harrison denied he had been involved in a sophisticated plot to
smuggle the girls through the UK to other European destinations.

He claimed
he had been duped by a friend who told him both girls were relatives in need of
help, before they flew to Spain and Greece, respectively, of their own
volition.

He told
the jury: 'When I was arrested the police told me I had been charged with trafficking.

'I was
shocked. I did not
know anything about any trafficking.'

From August 2004 until his arrest at the
end of last year, he worked as a caretaker at Newham Council.

Ms
Karmy-Jones added that it was impossible to be sure of his real age or name
because he had used at least seven different aliases at various times.

Harrsion was found guilty of two counts
of conspiracy to traffic people into the UK for sexual exploitation, two of
conspiracy to traffic out of the UK for sexual exploitation, two counts of
false imprisonment and four of conspiracy to facilitate breaches of immigration
law.

He also
admitted five counts of fraud by using false names to obtain employment, credit
cards and telephones at the outset of the trial.

Welcoming the conviction, DC Andy Desmond of the Metropolitan Police's Human Exploitation and
Organised Crime Command said: 'I would like to pay tribute to the two victims
who showed tremendous courage by talking to the police and agreeing to testify
against their captor.

'These
young women suffered the most terrifying and degrading ordeal - leaving them
emotionally, psychologically and physically traumatised.

'Most
cruelly of all, they were brainwashed into believing that if they disobeyed
their captors by seeking help, they would die.

'They were also told that if they
went to the police for help they would be handed straight back to their
captors.

'I hope
that this conviction sends out a strong message to other victims who have
suffered similar experiences that you can speak out without fearing for your
lives.

'The MPS is fully aware of this crime. We will listen to you, we will not
dismiss you and we will do all we that we can to bring the perpetrators to
justice.'
