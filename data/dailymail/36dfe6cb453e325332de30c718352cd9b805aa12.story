Determined: Dian Dian standing on his hind legs

'Walkies' looked like an impossible task when this little dog was born without his two front legs.

But thanks to his owner Dian Dian has overcome his disability and learned how to walk.

The tiny dog now spends his days trotting around on town hind legs due to the perseverance of his owner.

Cen Lan who lives in Nanning, capital of southern China's Guangxi Province, adopted the puppy six years ago.

A neighbour's pet gave birth to six puppies, and one of them surprisingly had no forelegs.

'He was one of six puppies in a litter and the healthy five were adopted, leaving him alone,' she explained.

'I could read from his eyes that he was disappointed and he was eager to walk.

'I then adopted him without hesitation.'

According to Cen Lan, Dian Dian initially moved like a seal on the ground, pushing his body forward with his hind legs.

But Cen Lan was determined to help the tiny dog learn to overcome his disability.

She came up with a training plan to help Dian Dian learn how to use his hind legs.

'I used food to train him to stand up, even for a second, she explained.

Gradually Dian Dian leaned how to stand on them for a longer duration and then he took his first tentative steps forward.

Since then there has been no holding 
him back and the happy little dog saunters around their home as well as 
going for walks in the town.

When he gets too tired from the exertion Cen Lan picks him up and pops him in her handbag for the trip home.

Special bond: Owner Cen Lan makes the pair matching outfits - she adopted the dog six years ago. According to Cen, Dian Dian initially moved like a seal on the ground, pushing his body forward with his hind legs

Training: 'I used food to train him to stand up, even for a second,' she explained. Gradually Dian Dian learned how to stand on his hind legs and then walk on them

The pair are now inseparable and his owner has even crafted Dian Dian a little skirt to match her trousers.

However, it hasnâ€™t all been smooth sailing for Cen Lan.

She comments: 'I was driven out once as the tenant believed that Dian Dian is a bad omen.

'Fortunately I now have my own house'.

And speaking about her pet, she added: 'He is part of my life and is my happy companion.'

Caring: The little dog was one of six puppies in a litter and the healthy five were adopted, leaving him alone so Cen Lan took him in
