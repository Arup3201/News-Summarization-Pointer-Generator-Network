England's first day of training in Miami gave an insight into how meticulous Roy Hodgson's preparations to cope with the heat and humidity in Brazil have stretched.

Several portable Lucozade cool boxes lined the side of the training pitch, with each bearing the names of individual players and containing tailor-made recovery drinks to cater for their different requirements.

The Football Association's Dave Reddin, exercise scientist Chris Neville, Manchester United fitness coach Tony Strudwick and Arsenal nutritionist James Collins have worked with experts from Loughborough University to customise recovery drinks with different electrolytes depending on the amount of fluid that that players lose through sweat.

Th conditions in Miami were hot enough to warrant the use of industrial cooling fans to help the players adapt to what is to come in Brazil.

Temperatures are expected to be in their 30s with humidity at between 80 - 100 per cent when England face Italy in their opening game in Manaus on June 12, and how England cope with those challenging conditions will be crucial to their performance.

Preparations began with warm weather training in Portugal where players were asked to wear several layers of clothing.

'We did sweat testing,' said Hodgson. 'We have a T-shirt, a lightweight training tracksuit and on top of that the wet top. Three layers.

'Apparently, it is individual. People sweat differently and need different drinks or whatever. The players went through today’s session with sweat pads on and they are being analysed and in terms of the extra heat we tried to generate.

'Because there are going to be uncomfortable moments and you’ve got to learn to get comfortable with that.

England captain, Steven Gerrard, told the Metro that the conditions are likely to dictate how the team will play.

‘Coming from playing every week in England to a hotter, more humid climate where you’re sweating more is obviously going to affect the way you play,’ he said.

‘Sprinting for long periods becomes more difficult and you need to take more breaks to breathe and get a sip of a drink to rehydrate. You need to place more control on the tempo of the game and ensure you don’t burn yourself out in the first half.

‘Each game and opponent requires a different plan, so yes, we will tailor our approach in Manaus to fit the requirements.’

Defender Leighton Baines said: 'The stuff with the sweat tests I have not experienced before. It is about ticking all the boxes and put us in the best place we can be, so we are prepared for everything.'

Hot stuff! Increased temperature, heart rate and dehydration are three factors that will affect England

According to John Brewer, a professor of sport science at the University of Bedfordshire, three factors will play a part in Manaus - dehydration, increased temperature and rise in heart rate.

‘Players could sweat three litres an hour very easily in the heat of humidity of Manaus. Within half an hour or 45 minutes, they could easily become dehydrated. They have to start the game properly hydrated, they have to hydrate during the game.

‘What happens when you sweat is you don’t just lose fluid, you lose electrolytes – and it’s those electrolytes, the sodium or the salt particularly within the body which help the muscles and the nerves function effectively – if you lose too many of them your performance can suffer.’
