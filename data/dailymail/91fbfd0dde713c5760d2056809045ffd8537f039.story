Shot: Jennie Leeman was killed with a gun which her husband David kept hidden for years in a secret compartment in a bedroom wall, a court heard

A property developer  murdered his wife after she had an affair with the tenant of one of their converted barns, a  court heard yesterday.

David Leeman, 60, shot his wife Jennie five times in the chest days after discovering her secret.

The couple, who had been married for 17 years and had four children together, had hit a rocky patch in their relationship, the jury heard.

Mrs Leeman, who was 44, started going out with 40-year-old Norman Laramy, a fellow parent she met through their children’s school. He had been living in a converted outbuilding on the Leemans’ remote farm in Devon and moved to a caravan with his new lover when their affair was discovered.

A few days later, Mrs Leeman drove back to the farm with Mr Laramy and one of her daughters. There, Mr Leeman asked his wife to accompany him to his office for a quick chat which descended into raised voices, screams and the sound of gunshots.

The jury heard that Leeman then pointed the semi-automatic pistol at his love rival, and told him: ‘It should have been you first.’

Mr Laramy ran from Higher Cowley Farm and hid in a field from where he called the police. After his arrest, it was said, Leeman told police: ‘I did it. She would just not listen. I shot the woman I loved because she didn’t do what I wanted.’

Leeman had accused Mr Laramy of being a drug dealer and paedophile, the court heard. He is said to have made a series of statements after the shooting, telling friends and family: ‘A man’s got to do what a man’s got to do to protect his family from perverts.’

He is also alleged to have said: ‘If I go to my God, I do so doing something good, protecting my daughters from a paedophile.’

Prosecuting, Geoffrey Mercer QC told 
the court that matters came to a head in the week running up to Mrs 
Leeman’s death last September. One of her sons overheard a telephone 
conversation between her and Mr Laramy and realised they were having an 
affair.

‘Emotions were running high,’ Mr Mercer said, adding that the two men later met and shook hands.

A few days later, when Mrs Leeman 
turned up at the farm to drop off her daughter, the situation took a 
violent twist. Mr Mercer said: ‘[Leeman] asked her to go with him for 
two minutes and she went with him, in fact to her death.

Gun: Mrs Leeman died almost instantly from chest injuries and also suffered injuries to her arms

‘She was unaware he had a loaded gun 
with him. They went into the barn and Mr Laramy heard an argument, then 
Jennie screaming, then shots, then further gunshots.’

Denial: Property developer David Leeman denies murdering his wife Jennie in September 2011

Leeman, who has admitted killing his wife, sobbed yesterday as the court was shown pictures of her body.

Mr Mercer told Exeter Crown Court: ‘He
shot her with a semi-automatic pistol.

'The magazine was loaded with 
five bullets and the defendant shot her five times, emptying the 
magazine, at close range to her chest area.

‘She would have died very quickly.’ 

Leeman, from Parracombe, Devon, denies murder but has admitted 
manslaughter ‘through loss of control’.

Mr Mercer said: ‘The defendant shot 
her having armed himself with a loaded gun, intending at the time he did
it to kill her. He is guilty of murder.’

Mr Laramy told the court: ‘I heard two
gunshots. There was a weird silence. I started running towards the 
barn.

'I had my boys with me and told them to run and get the police.

'I 
heard two more gunshots and as I got there, David walked out with the 
gun still in his hand.

'He made a sound like a wail.

‘I went in and found Jen. I kneeled 
beside her and touched her hand and told her I loved her.

'When I walked 
out, I met David who was with his sons, Rene and William, and he said 
“it should have been you first” and pointed the gun at me. I froze and 
Rene pushed the gun away.

‘I turned around and ran. I was in a panic. I kept running up the hill until I could get a signal to call the police.’

The trial continues.
