Controversial QPR playmaker Adel Taarabt has been left in limbo, having been left out of Harry Redknapp’s pre season squad and with no interest forthcoming from AC Milan, the club he was loaned to last season.

The 25-year-old Morocco playmaker spent time with Fulham and Milan during the last campaign, but neither would be willing to take the former Football League Player of the Year on a permanent move.

Taarabt reported back for pre season training at QPR’s Harlington base earlier this month but he has been omitted from Redknapp’s squad for their US tour.

Where next? Taarabt faces a difficult situation at QPR where he is out of favour with Harry Redknapp

His relationship with the former Portsmouth boss has cooled and Taarabt is now in a difficult situation – unwilling to go on loan again and with no clubs showing a concrete interest.

Even Gary O’Neil, who is out of contract at Loftus Road but in talks over a new deal, was included in the 26-man tour party at Taarabt’s expense.

Rs owner Tony Fernandes spoke earlier this month about his interest in keeping Taarabt at Loftus Road, but his relationship with Redknapp would appear to rule their former talisman out of the first team for now.

'He is probably one of the best players I have ever seen,' Fernandes said. 'He has a great football brain – he knows it. But it is up to him whether he wants to do it or not. From a professional standpoint I think it would be great if he stayed.'
