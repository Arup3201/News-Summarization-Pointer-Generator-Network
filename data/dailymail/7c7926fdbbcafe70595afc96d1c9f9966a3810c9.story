Gillian Kay (pictured) was attacked outside her Manchester home

This is the the 39-year-old headmistress whose attacker left her with nine stab wounds on her neck and face, a court heard today.

Gillian Kay was subjected to a frenzied attack outside her home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.

48-year-old Mark Pierson appeared before  Rochdale and Bury Magistrates' Court today and has been remanded in custody, charged with the attempted murder of Mrs Kay.

He has been charged with allegedly attacking Mrs Kay outside her home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, with a screwdriver.

Her attacker is said to have used a screwdriver to stab her face and neck.

Police were called to the scene in Shaw Road, Thornham, following reports that she had been stabbed three times.

The assailant was reportedly wrestled to the ground by a passing motorist.

Mrs
Kay, head teacher at Propps Hall 
Primary School in Failsworth, was airlifted to Wythenshawe Hospital 
after Thurday's attack.

She has since been released following treatment 
to her wounds.

One neighbour said: 'She is a really nice lady and her family are good people.

'She had just got out of her car when it happened.

'A man was driving past in a van and he drove onto the verge and got this guy off.

'The neighbour further up the road 
rushed out straight away to help her. This is 
totally unexpected.'

through.

'They were in the field for about half an hour before they took 
off again.'

Carol 
Leigh, who also lives on Shaw Road, said: 'I was stunned when I heard 
the sound and realised a helicopter had landed. I really hope she is 
okay.'

In care: Mrs Gillian Kay, headteacher at Propps Hall Community Primary School was airlifted to hospital on Thursday. She has since been released following treatment to her wounds

Propps Hall Community Primary School will remain open as usual while Mrs Kay recovers in hospital

Detective Inspector Andy Aston, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This incident will understandably have caused a lot of concern and anxiety in the local area and I'm sure everyone in the community will be thinking of the woman and wishing her a full recovery after her ordeal.

'I also understand there may be lots of rumour and speculation about what has happened but I would stress that, as we are still at the outset of our investigation, it is important we establish all the facts first.

'However, what I can say is there is no threat to anyone else in the community and it is also important to stress that reports about this being a 'neighbour dispute' or 'neighbour feud' are wrong, so I would ask that people do not speculate.

'We will of course keep the community informed of any developments with this case.'

Anyone with information should call police on 101 or the independent Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
