The traditional living room has been turned into a media zone where the household watches television while using tablets and smartphones, according to new research.

Ofcom's annual State of the Nation report revealed that households are increasingly reverting to sitting around a TV set and watching shows together again - a habit that harks back to the bygone days of the 1950s. 

However, around half of viewers now spend this time multi-tasking, streaming videos, sending instant messages, tweeting and posting to Facebook.

The bygone days of the 1950s where families watched TV together, pictured, may be making a comeback. Around 91 per cent of adults now sit and watch television in their living room each week

According to research from Leiden University, six out of ten meals in British homes are now eaten while watching TV. 

Yet researchers found that eating on a sofa while watching your favourite show could be making you fat.

In a series of experiments, Dutch researchers made diners carry out complicated memory tests while eating food that was either salty, sweet, or sour.

The study found that those who were distracted by the mental task were more likely to perceive the food as bland.

Another experiment found they consumed more food in order to obtain  the same taste level and were less aware of how much they ate.

This has also lead to the rise in what's been dubbed 'media meshing' where people use these devices to virtually discuss the programme they are watching.

Ofcom said a quarter of viewers 'mesh' while watching TV and during
this year's Wimbledon men's tennis final, for example, a total of 1.1 million people 
worldwide tweeted 2.6 million times using hashtags relating to the match.

Half of telly addicts instead 'media stack', which is when they use their phones or tablets to carry out activities not related in anyway to the show they're watching.

This includes liking and commenting on Facebook posts and shopping online.

The rise of the 'digital hub' has been caused by an increase in sales of smartphones and tablets.

According to the report, the average household now owns more than
three types of internet-enabled device.

While one in five families have six or 
more gadgets in their home that can be connected to the web.

Despite watching TV together, a rise in phone and tablet sales means people are doing so while tweeting, shopping and streaming videos turning living rooms into digital hubs, pictured. Second TVs are also being replaced in favour of 'jumbo' sets around 43 inches big

Half of adults now have a smartphone, and the amount of tablets have more than doubled - last year a total of 11 per cent of homes owned a tablet, this is now around a quarter.

During the 1990s and 2000s, second television sets became more popular, especially with children watching TV in their bedrooms.

This trend is being replaced with families buying just one bigger, so-called 'jumbo' TV sets measuring 43 inches or more.

More than 41 per cent of homes now just have the single set compared to last year with sales of larger screens increasing from 4.3 per cent.

The number of five to 15-year-olds with a
television in their bedroom has dropped from 69 per cent in 2007 to 52 
per cent in the first quarter of this year.
