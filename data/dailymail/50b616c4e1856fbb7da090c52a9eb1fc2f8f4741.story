Fernando Alonso's foray into cycling will not take place in 2015, but the UCI will welcome further discussions over a team backed by the former Formula One world champion.

The UCI on Wednesday announced the teams who have registered for racing licences for the forthcoming season, with an Alonso-backed team not among them despite prolonged discussions over his entry into the sport.

"The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) has announced the teams that have so far registered for licences for the 2015 season," a statement read.

"Over the last few months the UCI has had very cordial and productive discussions with Fernando Alonso and his representatives concerning a possible team for 2015.

"Whilst this has not led to a team for 2015, we thank Fernando Alonso for his interest and engagement and look forward to continuing discussions with him and/or his advisers if they wish to pursue that interest further.

"Our door will always be open to all those who want to invest in the future of our sport."
