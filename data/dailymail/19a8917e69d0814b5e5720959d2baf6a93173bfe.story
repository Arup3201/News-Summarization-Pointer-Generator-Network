They hired some of the most famous women in the country and a celebrity photographer to showcase their latest collection – forking out £5million for  the privilege.

But Marks & Spencer’s make-or-break advertising campaign has failed to deliver a much-needed boost to sales.

M&S yesterday revealed that its sales of fashion and general merchandise have fallen, a trend that has hampered the firm for more than two years.

Meanwhile, budget brand Primark is faring much better announcing record profits of £154million last year.

Flop? The leading ladies show off the M&S collection, but but clothing and general merchandise sales are down yet again

Mixed fortunes: Primark has today announced record profits as struggling rival Marks & Spencer revealed its ninth consecutive quarter of falling clothing sales and a drop in profits

The store's total sales rose by 22 per cent, while its like-for-like figures were also up five per cent  in the year to 14 September, pushing up their profits 44 per cent.

Unlike M&S, it relied on a reputation for low prices rather than expensive marketing campaigns to drive sales.

M&S
 figures come despite its ‘Leading Ladies’ initiative, starring the 
likes of Dame Helen Mirren and Tracey Emin and photographed by Annie 
Leibovitz, which was meant to propel the firm in a new direction.

The
 chain faces a make-or-break Christmas to turn round its fortunes as as 
its first-half pre-tax profits for 2013 declined by nine per cent to 
£261.1million, well down on the £289.5million the previous year.

The High Street stalwart also revealed that like-for-like clothing and homeware sales fell 1.3 per cent during its July to September quarter.

However,
 M&S' food halls continue to do a roaring trade with like-for-like 
sales up 3.2 per cent, and its share price was up 15p this morning.

The numbers will increase the pressure 
on chief executive Marc Bolland, who will be disappointed that clothing 
sales have refused to recover and will blame the unseasonably warm 
autumn weather and fierce competition on the High Street.

Bolland
 attempted to revive clothes sales, particularly womenswear, earlier 
this year when he unveiled a new autumn/winter collection that analysts 
described as 'make or break' for M&S and its chief executive.

He said of the latest results: '‘This is a journey. We’ve been clear that people should look at it from season to season. It will take a few collections to get a positive momentum behind it.’

The latest sales figures cover the period up to the end of September, so Bolland will defend performance and say that a fuller picture of its autumn/winter collection’s success will be due in January. 

This week M&S launches its Christmas ‘Believe in Magic and Sparkle’ advertisement with a glossy Alice in Wonderland theme.

It stars Rosie Huntingdon-Whitely as Alice, David Gandy as the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Wizard of Oz.

It makes this year’s Christmas trading period even more crucial, and if it did not go well his job may be under threat.

In contrast to the struggles of M&S as it tries to kickstart its clothing sales, AB Foods paid tribute to Primark's buying teams after autumn/winter and spring/summer ranges sold out with little discount.

Primark's expansion in the UK has been focused on increasing selling space in major cities, with the opening of its second store on London's Oxford Street and extensions to shops in Newcastle and Manchester.

The company expects to add more than a million square feet of space in the current year, including its first store in France, which will open in Marseille.

It said its new store formats provided an 'exciting, fashionable and fun shopping experience'.

Embarrassing: The retailer, which has just reported a  9.1 per cent slump in half-year profits, blamed a supplier for the mistake that lists Father's Day as June 22 instead of June 15

Pressure: The numbers will increase the pressure on chief executive Marc Bolland, who will be disappointed that clothing sales have refused to recover

The company added: 'Strategically-placed mannequins help to inspire customers to choose outfits that are readily available on adjacent fixtures, and prominent signage and wider aisles enable easy navigation through the store.

'We are also enhancing customer service by providing a higher ratio of fitting rooms and cash registers to ensure a smoother experience when trying on outfits and paying for them.'

In April, a building in Bangladesh occupied on one of its floors by a Primark supplier collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people.

Another disastrous festive trading period will further test shareholders’ patience who have become disillusioned with the retail giant’s performance since Bolland took over in May 2010. 

Freddie George, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, believes although the company is adopting the right strategy to revitalise its womenswear, he continues to have a number of concerns.  

He says: ‘It will take a number of seasons before there is a marked improvement in performance in womenswear.’
