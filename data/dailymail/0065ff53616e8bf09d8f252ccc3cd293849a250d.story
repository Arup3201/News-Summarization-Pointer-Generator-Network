A German-language folk band have been asked to return 13 awards after it emerged that they have been 'faking' the music on their albums.

The seven-man Kastelruther Spatzen used studio musicians to create their famous Alpine brass-band sound, their former producer claims.

The revelations have made the headlines in Germany echoing the scandal surrounding early 90s lip-syncing pop-sensation Milli Vanilli.

'Fake': Folk music favourites Kastelruther Spatzen are being accused of 'faking music' after it emerged they use studio musicians

Kastelruther Spatzen, from the German-speaking
province of South Tyrol in northern Italy, were defended by their 
manager who said using studio musicians were 'common practice'.

'The success of this band is based on a 
giant fraud,' former producer Walter Widemair told Bild newspaper.

He said that only the lead singer's voice was genuine on the albums and called for the group to return their prices.

'The band of fakes must give back their Echo awards,' he said.

Kastelruther Spatzen's manager Helmut Brossmann said that  it was common practice for folk music bands to use studio musicians for their albums.

In his defence of the popular folk-music band, he said Kastelruther Spatzen had even listed the studio musicians on their albums.

Real thing: Their former producer said lead singer Norbert Rier, seen here accepting a Folk Music award in Germany earlier this year, was the only 'genuine' voice on the albums

In a statement on the band's website Mr 
Brossmann said Widemair had been responsible for the studio recordings 
for nearly 30 years and was now betraying the band for commercial 
reasons - to help promote his own book.

'The names of the studio musician and everyone who contributed to the chorus of songs was mentioned in every CD that they were involved in,' said Brossmann.

'In nearly 30 years of concert tours, they always played and sang everything live.'

The dispute has received much media attention in Germany, with newspapers recalling the scandal of their fellow countrymen in pop duo Milli Vanilli.

German producer Frank Farian turned two young Munich models, Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, into the group known as Milli Vanilli.

The group had great international success in the late 80s and early 90s with songs such as 'Girl You Know It's True' and 'Blame It On The Rain', but were disgraced when it emerged that they had been miming to other people's vocals.

They were stripped of their 1990 Grammy Award and their management faced over 20 lawsuits.
