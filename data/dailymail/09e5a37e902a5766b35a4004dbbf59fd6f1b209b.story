New role? Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured leaving 10 Downing Street last week after attending the final cabinet meeting of this parliament

Theresa May is being lined up to become Foreign Secretary, tasked with clawing back powers from Brussels, it emerged today.

David Cameron is said to be considering promoting the Home Secretary to lead the fight to overhaul Britain’s membership of the European Union.

The Prime Minister has made clear that if he is returned to Downing Street after the election he wants talks on EU reform to begin immediately.

The Tories are going into the election campaign as the only party promising to renegotiate EU membership before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has visited almost every European capital in a bid to build support for his call for reform.

Now it has emerged that the Prime Minister is considering handing the plumb job to Mrs May, according to the Independent on Sunday.

She would be seen as 'Britain’s answer to Angela Merkel', government sources say.

Mr Cameron yesterday hailed Mrs May as a 'brilliant' Home Secretary who had cut crime and 'told Abu Hamza to sling his hook'.

Foreign Office insiders insist there is growing support for the reforms called for by Mr Cameron.

It includes curbing access to benefits for migrants, ending child benefit being exported to families overseas and tighter controls on families coming to Britain.

Close ties with Mrs Merkel are seen as vital. 'Five years ago you could get a senior official to go to Paris or Washington but not Berlin,' a senior source told MailOnline. 

'But now the relationship with Germany is on a more formal footing, and Merkel had made clear she wants us to stay.'

However, securing agreement on a referendum after the election could prove difficult.

Lib Dems leader Nick Clegg accused the Tories of dancing a 'hokey cokey where one day they want to leave, the next day they don't want to leave'.

Speaking at his campaign launch in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, he said: 'We are unambiguous as a party that says "yes, Europe needs to be reformed, yes there needs to be a referendum when a decision needs to be made about the transfer of powers to the European Union, we guaranteed that in law".

'We are not like the Conservative Party, half of whom are straining at the leash to leave. We think that would be a terrible thing for the British economy.'

He added: 'Of course it would be an economic act of self harm to leave the European Union.

'Large parts of the Conservative Party and Ukip appear to want Britain to cut itself off from what is the world's largest marketplace with hundreds of millions of customers for British goods and services.

'For me it's stating the flaming obvious that we need to secure Britain's presence at the heart of the European Union in the same way it's flaming obvious that we should secure the British economic recovery by finishing the job of balancing the books but doing it in a fair and sensible way - not taking an ideological approach to cuts, which is the Conservative approach, nor taking such an irresponsible approach to borrowing, which is Labour's approach.'
