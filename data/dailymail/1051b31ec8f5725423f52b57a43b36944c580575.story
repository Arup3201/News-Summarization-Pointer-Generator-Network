Remembering 10 years on, the Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta was an attack that defied the terrorists’ mission to generate hatred and fear between the two countries.

Victims and family members returned to the Australian High Commission in Jakarta, Indonesia to mark its 10th anniversary and commemorate the 2004 terrorist bomb explosion on Tuesday. 

On September 9, 2004, a jihadist recruit detonated a one-tonne car bomb outside the embassy that had such force, it was heard 8km away.

Ambassador to Indonesia Greg Moriarty, led the private tribute to the victims, their families and the survivors at the embassy on Tuesday.

‘In the chaos, Australians and Indonesians pulled together,’ Mr Moriarty told AAP.

‘Even as the smoke cleared and the sirens blared, we knew the terrorists had failed.

‘Instead of driving us apart, Indonesians and Australians turned towards each other under the most testing of times on that awful day.

The embassy lost two Indonesian staff – a gardener and a guard. Nine people were killed, including the bomber and more than 200 people were injured during the attack.

‘This busy Embassy continues to work to promote Australia’s interests with Indonesia and to strengthen relations between our two countries.

‘Let us honour those who were lost to those who still suffer from the consequences of that awful day.

‘And on this day, let us renew our determination to promote tolerance and mutual understanding between the peoples of our two countries.’

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop  remarked her speech at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ceremony service in Canberra on Tuesday.

‘We acknowledge those whose lives have been touched by this awful event - honouring those we lost, remembering those who still live with the trauma and the grief,’ she said.

‘While mourning their loss, we owe a debt of gratitude to the ten Indonesian nationals, who were employees and supporters of our work in Jakarta, and those who were killed protecting our Embassy.

‘We think of those who are still coping with terrible injuries and the loss of their loved ones.’
