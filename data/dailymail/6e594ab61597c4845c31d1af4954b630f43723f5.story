King Richard III was laid to rest in a ceremony at Leicester Cathedral today, and his final resting place is sure to become Britain's newest tourist attraction.

The last English king to die in battle, his remains were found under a car park three years ago and reburied in a ceremony the reigning Queen said was of 'great international significance'.

With the ceremony over, Leicester is preparing for the type of tourism boost that has been enjoyed by Stratford-upon-Avon, Windsor, Whitby and other cities and towns which are home to famous resting places.

His rightful resting place: Leicester Cathedral following a service for the re-burial of Richard III

Richard was re-interred at Leicester Cathedral in central England 530 years after he was slain at the Battle of Bosworth Field in August, 1485.

At the ceremony, he was reburied with the honour his modern-day supporters say his conqueror in battle Henry Tudor, later Henry VII, denied him.

All over the country, famous resting places make for popular tourist spots. Visit England has rounded up some of the most-visited grave sites in the country.
