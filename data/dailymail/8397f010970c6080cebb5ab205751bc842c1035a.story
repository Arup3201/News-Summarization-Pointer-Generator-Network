A Denver father says he's been forced to watch his daughter be twice resuscitated and battle for her life after taking a sample of a tainted rave drug.

According to a Facebook post that has quickly gone viral with more than 17,000 shares, Keith Roehm said his daughter Bianca ended up in the hospital after attending an electronic dance music festival called Skylab at the Denver Coliseum on Sunday.

While there she took Molly, which he claimed was part of a 'bad batch' that had circulated and poisoned several other people at Sklab.

Bianca has since made some strides towards recovery, sitting up and speaking softly

The 17-year-odl Denver East High School student is now in critical condition. 

'She is now on life support and going into renal failure. Her heartbeat was at 165 beats per minute and her temperature was at 108 degrees for 20 minutes,' Roehm wrote.

'They had to resuscitate her twice. My daughter died in front of us twice! On 9-16-14 her brother, Evan, had an episode and decided to drink bleach, and although he's in a seperate hospital, I have tell him that his sister might not make it, and I could seriously use some help right now...Please share this to bring awareness to what happens at these raves.'

'Molly' is a term for a purified version of amphetamine drug MDMA, widely known as Ecstasy, favored in club culture.

'This could be your child,' Roehm wrote. 'Mine was responsible and did well in school. These raves are death peddlers...'

A Go Fund Me page has been set up seeking $10,000 to help with Bianca's medical care and has received $440 in donations so far. 

A recent update to the page claimed she was still in critical condition but appeared to be improving.

'She woke up this morning, sat up, whispered something, then went back to sleep! Making real progress!'
