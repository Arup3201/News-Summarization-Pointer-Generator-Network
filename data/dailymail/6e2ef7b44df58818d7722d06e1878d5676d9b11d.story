Newcastle United outcast Hatem Ben Arfa was on target as a reserve XI drew 4-4 with Queen of the South.

The French forward was left behind on Tyneside while Alan Pardew’s senior squad traveled to New Zealand at the weekend.

The Magpies kicked off their tour with a 4-0 win over Sydney in Dunedin on Tuesday.

But Ben Arfa was back at the club’s Benton training base where he appeared in a behind-closed-doors friendly against the Scottish Championship side.

Callum Roberts (2) and Gael Bigirimana got United’s other goals, while Gavin Reilly (2), Kevin Dzierzawski and Iain Russell were on the score sheet for the visitors.

Ben Arfa’s future at the club remains in doubt. He has one year left on his current contract but is not part of Pardew’s first-team plans and has trained with the reserves during the past fortnight.

Compatriot Sylvain Marveuax was also omitted from the squad for the tour of New Zealand but he joined Ligue 1 side Guingamp on a season-long loan on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, reports that United have agreed terms with Mauricio Isla of Juventus are not true and the Chile international has never been a target of the Magpies.
