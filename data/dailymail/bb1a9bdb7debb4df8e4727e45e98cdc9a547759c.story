Hundreds of people have objected to plans for a controversial leisure and housing development  created by a team that includes Judy Murray and golfer Colin Montgomerie.

The proposed Park of Keir development promises to create jobs and includes a hotel, a tennis and golf super-centre, and 100 homes near Stirling in Central Scotland.

But the plans mooted by the group including the mother of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray have been met with strong opposition from 200 residents who have filed objections with Stirling Council.

The leisure centre, at Park of Keir between Dunblane and Bride of Allan in Stirlingshire, is being touted by Montgomerie as a place to nurture the next generation of Scotland’s tennis and golf stars.

If approved, it will feature six indoor and six outdoor tennis courts, a six-hole golf course and practice range, mini golf, a 3G multi-sport all-weather pitch and space for changing facilities, coaching suites, and cafe and restaurant. 

The facility is expected to create around 170 jobs and developers claim it will pump millions of pounds into the local economy and attract tourists.

If the plans are given the green light, it will result in the building of the second hotel linked to the Murray family.

Earlier this year, Andy opened a five-star resort in Perthshire, north of the proposed Park of Keir development site.

Five-star Cromlix, which was crowned Scottish hotel after opening in April, boasts 10 bedrooms and five suites which overlook manicured grounds and tennis courts. 

Planning permission was lodged for the latest plans last month by the Park of Keir’s partners – Murray, Montgomerie and King Group.

King Group owns the land, which occupies about 15 per cent of the 110-hectare park.

After receiving almost 200 complaints, Stirling Council  extended Tuesday's deadline for objections or letters of support until council planners are ready to make a recommendation.

Ann Shaw, secretary of Residents Against Greenbelt Erosion (RAGE), the campaign group fighting the development, said she asked planning bosses at Stirling Council to extend the deadline.

She said: ‘It is typical of the way planning applications are dealt with by our council.

‘Controversial ones are submitted at a time when people are least likely to have time to consider it such as now, during the holiday season, or just before Christmas.

‘Many organisations, such as the local community councils, do not meet during summer and have not had time to look at this application, yet it impacts on all our lives.’

Following a series of public consultations and meetings with community stakeholders, the development team scaled back some aspects of the original proposal.

The developers changed the golf course to six holes from nine and promised to maintain a permanent green belt between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan.

They also indicated they are keen to enter into discussions with local communities about turning residual land into a community park to address concerns about future housing development.
