Manchester United may have a new secret weapon to try and attract Cristiano Ronaldo back to Old Trafford - club legend Bryan Robson.

Captain Marvel joked that he was going to go to Madrid to try and tempt the Real winger back to Manchester at the launch of the United Legends match against Bayern Munich.

Robson, 58, who will manage the United side, was responding to comments from Bayern counterpart Paul Breitner who claimed he was going to tempt Owen Hargreaves, who played for both sides, to represent Bayern in the Red Heart Charity match which raises money for the Manchester United Foundation.

United's line-up for the June 14 clash will include Edwin van der Sar who will play for the club at Old Trafford for the first time since he hung up his gloves in 2011 in the second leg of this clash between  the legends of the two European superclubs.

The Red veterans travelled to Munich in August 2014 for the first leg against their German counterparts, with goals from Paul Scholes and Andy Cole resulting in a 3-3 draw, so there is all to play for in the return match in June.

Robson revealed that other figures from the club's recent history will also wear the red shirt again.

'Jaap Stam, Ronny Johnsen, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville, Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole, Quinton Fortune and Denis Irwin too,' he said.

'The squad's coming together quite nicely and I'm happy with it.'

Breitner reeled off a number of names he will have in his squad - Giovani Elber, Niko and Robert Kovac, Roy Makaay, Paulo Sergio, Michael Tarnat, Mark van Bommel, Daniel van Buyten and Dietmar Hamann.

Robson added that he was hoping to see Old Trafford sold out.

Andy Cole is congratulated on the third goal in Munich by his team-mates, and United will want to win this time

'The Legends game against Real Madrid in 2013 raised around £1million for charity with a crowd of over 60,000,' he said.

'That was great but hopefully we can fill the stadium this time around. To raise that sum was brilliant for a one-off event and I think it’s important to clarify all the lads play for nothing.

'Nobody gets paid for being involved and we know what sort of an impact the funds have on the community through the Manchester United Foundation.'
