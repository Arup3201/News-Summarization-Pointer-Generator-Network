An investigation into firefighters having sex on their truck at California's fire academy has revealed a frat boy lifestyle that included drinking on duty and using state cellphones for hundreds of sexually explicit photos.

A battalion chief now on trial for murder also slapped a female cadet on the buttocks and was not disciplined, according to newly released documents. 

The complaints about the Fire Academy in Ione came after a $2 million investigation that started in May after academy instructor Orville Fleming was charged with murder in the death of a former escort who became his girlfriend.

An investigation after the murder charge against Orville Fleming, now 56, in the death of his girlfriend and former escort Sarah June Douglas, 26. New information shows he also slapped a female cadet on the behind

Fleming has pleaded not guilty to killing 26-year-old Sarah June Douglas. 

His estranged wife told Sacramento County sheriff's investigators and reporters that she watched a video that showed the victim having sex with her husband and other firefighters on fire trucks.

She also alleged that the firefighters had sex with prostitutes. 

Investigators never found the purported video.

However, their work led to the new allegations against the academy in Ione, which are contained in four complaints brought by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Assistant Chief Mike Ramirez was fired last month for drinking alcohol and allowing others to drink on duty. 

He also is accused of failing to take action when Fleming allegedly slapped the female cadet's behind. 

The public records say Fleming, now 56, displayed a partially nude photo of the victim to Ramirez, although the name of his late girlfriend was redacted.

Investigators did not find the purported video of Ms Douglas and firefighters having sex on a fire truck, but discovered a series of alleged offences that led to the current complaints

Ramirez also failed to act when Fleming made sexual comments to another female firefighter, or when a third firefighter showed sexually explicit photographs in the academy's dormitory area, according to documents.

The assistant chief also is accused of misusing his state vehicle, being insubordinate and lying during the investigation, among other allegations.

His attorney Gary Messing said that the allegations are 'overblown' or lack merit, according to the Sacramento Bee.

He said that investigators had to find offences after investing time and money looking into the academy. 

Sixteen workers were put on administrative leave in December after preliminary investigation results were received by CAL Fire. 

Three other firefighters are also challenging their discipline.

Battalion Chief Bryant Camarena is appealing the demotion he received for showing colleagues some of the hundreds of sexual images he had on his state-issued cellphone, among other alleged violations. 

His new position is fire apparatus engineer, which pays $1,800 less per month.

Fire captains Michael T. Roe and Daniel Valenzuela are appealing their demotions for consuming alcohol and tolerating others' drinking on duty.

Valenzuela also is accused misusing a state vehicle to return drunken cadets to the academy and displaying sexual photographs on his cellphone. 

He also reportedly received a link to a 'sex club for swingers' on his cell phone from one of the captains. 

Roe is also accused of failing to aid a cadet who became so drunk he vomited and passed out at a bar.

The captain was suspended for a 60-day stretch that ends April 11 and Valenzuela was suspended for 30 days.

Both were demoted to fire apparatus engineer.

Their union is representing the firefighters, though President Mike Lopez and spokesman Terry McHale declined comment Friday. 

Information about the discipline of CAL Fire employees became public following a Public Records request (file photo)

Neither Ramirez nor Camarena responded to requests for comment made through the union.

The complaints became public when the four employees appealed their punishments to the State Personnel Board.

They are among 16 employees who faced discipline from the investigation. 

One resigned, a second employee was fired and the others were suspended, demoted or had their pay reduced. 

Fifteen of the 16 were instructors at the Fire Academy in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento.

Department spokeswoman Janet Upton also declined comment, citing the ongoing appeals process.  

Fleming was arrested following a two-week manhunt after Ms Douglas' body was discovered in the home they shared. 

He is next scheduled to appear in court in March.
