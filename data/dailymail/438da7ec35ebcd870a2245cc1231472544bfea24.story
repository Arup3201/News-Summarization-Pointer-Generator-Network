Most James Bond fans know their favourite secret agent as suave and sexy, with a naughty glint in his eye.

Spanish readers, however, believe 007 is far more conservative.

Fifty years after the first book was published, Spaniards are still reading heavily censored versions, with suggestive words including 'virgin' and 'breast' deleted from the text.

Too racy: Sean Connery in the 1965 film version of Thunderball with dark-haired beauty Claudine Auger

Body of the text: Ursula Andress in Dr No, 1963, which also 
starred Sean Connery. Spanish readers might not recognise the tale, 
however, because the last two pages of the book were cut

Bangor University academic Dr Jordi Cornella-Detrell, who discovered that the censored versions are still being reproduced, said the news was 'disconcerting and difficult to explain'.

Strict censors in Madrid originally cut passages from Ian Fleming's books before allowing them to be published while the country was under dictator General Franco's rule in the 1940.

THUNDERBALL (1974)

These 'poor erotic descriptions' were cut:

The mounded V of the bikini looked up at Bond and the proud breasts in the tight cups were two more eyes.

She kept her arms round his neck while he undid the single button of the brassiere and then the tapes of the taut slip. He stepped out of his bathing trunks and kicked them away.

The general impression, Bond decided, was of a willful, high-tempered, sensual girl — a beautiful Arab mare who would only allow herself to be ridden by a horseman with steel tights and velvet hands, and then only with curb and saw-bite – and then only when he had broken her to bridle and saddle.

He bent down and hooked his fingers in the neckline of her shirt and the join of the brassiere. Very slowly, but with great force, he tore downwards, the whole length of her. Then he threw aside the torn halves of material and exposed the whole gleaming length of her body.

His right hand held the memory of a beautiful breast.

DR NO (1960/74) These passages were cut:

'You don't have to make love to me… We could go to sleep back to front, you know, like spoons.'

'You're a wonderful girl. I thought so directly I saw you.''Saw my behind, you mean.' The voice was getting drowsy, but it was full of pleasure. Bond laughed. 'Well, it was a wonderful behind. And the other side was wonderful too.'

She stepped down into the bath and lay at full length. The fair hair on her body glittered up through the water like golden sovereigns. She said provocatively, 'You've got to wash me. I don't know what to do.'

'Why don't you like playing? I want to play at being married.'

Bond bent his head down into the warm soft hand and bit softly into the swelling. He felt her other hand in his hair. He bit harder. She was panting. He bit still harder. She gave a little scream and wrenched his head away by the hair.

She undid her blouse and threw it on the floor. Then her skirt. She undid his shirt and slowly, carefully took it off.

The girl let go his hand and climbed into the sleeping-bag. She looked up at him. She said, practically, 'It's a double one. It cost a lot of money. Take those off and come in. You owe me slave-time.'

The behind was almost as firm and rounded as a boy's.

The muscles of her behind bunched with tension.

Bond could feel the hairs on his leg being parted. It was an insect. [The word ‘hairs’ was censored in this particularly bizarre example.]

Even today, almost all the books remain censored and in some, entire chapters are omitted.

Dr Cornella-Detrell, a lecturer in Hispanic studies, said Spain did not want the books published at all.

'During Franco’s regime, foreign ideas 
were perceived as a potential threat to the moral and social fabric of 
the country,' he said.

'The regime promoted the very Catholic nature of Spain and 
censored literature that was at odds with this or with its political 
stance. Ian Fleming’s novels were fairly sexually explicit
 and salacious for that era.

'Attempts to publish the novel were met with fierce opposition by the Spanish censors.'

Dr Cornella-Detrell originally set out 
to research censorship during Franco's regime, and was surprised to see that the discrepancies between the English and Spanish versions of sixth Bond novel Dr No still existed.

He went on to find
 that many edited versions of translated novels in the country are still being republished and read in Spain today.

'A translation of Dr No presented in 1960
 was rejected outright by the censors,' he said. 'Five years later, they forced 
substantial cuts on the editor.

'The last two pages of the novel were deemed to be pornographic and completely excised. As a consequence the ending feels rushed and makes little sense.

'The
 effects of censorship on this text, however, did not end with the 
regime’s collapse, since expurgated versions of Dr No were reprinted in 
1996, 2001 and 2011.

Dr Cornella-Detrell is now keen to explore why the advent of 
democracy did not stop the production, circulation and consumption of 
censored books.

He said: 'It is a well known fact that Spaniards have found it difficult
 to come to terms with and confront their problematic recent history.

'The so-called ‘pact of forgetting’, a conscious decision 
not to question or examine the past in order to facilitate the 
transition to democracy, has prevented readers, libraries and publishing
 companies from developing strategies to address this issue.

Some books 
have been retranslated or restored, but as a result of the general 
amnesia surrounding the regime’s cultural policies, these efforts have 
passed largely unnoticed, to the point that Spanish public libraries, 
unaware of the problem, still promote the reading of censored 
materials.'

'I want to see this issue raised and discussed more widely in Spain so 
that readers in Spain can have access to re-translated or restored 
books.'

Fleming's novels are not the only English-language classics that have remained edited or unavailable in Spain.

Other examples include John Dos Passos’s Parallel 42, Muriel Spark’s 
The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s Baby, Carson 
McCuller's The Member of the Wedding and J.M Cain’s The Postman Always 
Rings Twice.
