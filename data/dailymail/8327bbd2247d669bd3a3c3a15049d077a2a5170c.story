A 31-stone conman and his teenage son who conned a dying pensioner out of £17,500 for odd jobs and gardening that should have cost no more than £1,700 have been told to repay just £2.82 by a judge.

Obese Edward Dolan, 48, and his son Michael, 19, from Stokesley, North Yorkshire, made thousands of pounds by tricking vulnerable pensioners into handing over vast amounts in exchange for work worth a fraction of what they charged.

Together with accomplice William McElvaney, also 19, of Whitby, they were jailed last August after the Dolans admitted money laundering and all three admitted conspiracy to defraud.

Michael Dolan, 19, left, and his father Edward, 48, must pay back just £2.82 after conning OAPs out of £32,853

But last week the Dolans were ordered to pay the State just a fraction of the money they had swindled at a Proceeds of Crime hearing at Teesside Crown Court after it emerged that the men had little money left to pay.

Despite lawyers agreeing that the older Dolan made £10,629 from crime, Judge Peter Armstrong ordered that he should pay just a nominal £1, while his son, who made £32,853, was told to pay just £1.82. 

The court heard that despite the many thousands the Dolans had made from crime, they had no money left to pay for their crimes.

Meanwhile McElvaney, who the court heard had more than £4,000 available to him, was ordered to pay £93.76 back to the elderly woman he tricked, after it was decided that was how much he made from the crime.

A court heard last summer how the threesome took cash and cheques for work which was either poor or not carried out.

The Dolans picked on an 84-year-old man with terminal cancer in the nearby village of Marske, repeatedly targeting his home between June 2009 and September 2011.

William McElvaney, 19, from Whitby, had more than £4,000 available to him but was only told to pay £93.76 back to his elderly victim because that was all he was judged to have made from his crime

They were caught out the day after the elderly man died in October 2011, when the older Dolan went to the man's home to see if he wanted more work done.

He was met by the man’s grieving son, who became suspicious and called police.

An expert estimated the work, for which the man had been charged £17,450 over two years, to be worth about £1,700.

Another victim, targeted by the younger Dolan and his friend, McElvaney, was a 90-year-old woman with dementia in the village of Hutton Rudby, four miles from the Dolans' home. 

In June 2012 she told her son she had no money because she had paid it all to gardeners.  Her purse was emptied of pension money, and it emerged that she had paid them about £180 in three weeks for non-existent work.

In the subsequent court case, Michael Dolan, who was just 15 at the start of the conspiracy and had no previous convictions, claimed to be the operator of the business.

He was sentenced to two years in a young offenders’ institution last August and is still in custody. His father was jailed for 15 months, while McElvaney received nine months in a youth offenders’ institution.

Judge Armstrong said as he passed sentence: 'The public need to know that those who involve themselves in offences like this will go to prison.'
