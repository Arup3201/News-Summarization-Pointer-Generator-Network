The White House claims it can't fulfill a request to deem the controversial Westboro Baptist Church a hate group. But it said President Barack Obama considered the group's actions - which include picketing at solders' funerals - reprehensible.

The Obama administration was responding to petitions through the White House website that called for the Church group to be deemed a hate group and the federal government to revoke its tax-exempt status. Almost 700,000 people signed five related petitions demanding action.

But the White House said it was unable to change the status of the church because the government doesn't maintain a list of hate groups. The group claims when American troops die, it's God's punishment for America tolerating homosexuality and abortion.

But the White House is releasing a map showing where the petition-signers come from. The map shows high density in Kansas, where the Westboro group is based, and Connecticut, where church members threatened to picket Newtown victims' funerals.

The news comes just two weeks after a gay wedding was held a few feet from the  infamous Westboro Baptist Church's headquarters. 

Followers of the religion are known for their 'God Hates Fags' placards and anti-gay preaching.

Kimberly Kidwell and Katie Short exchanged vows on June 22 outside the rainbow-painted Equality House across the street in Topeka, Kansas.

Joyous occasion: Aaron Jackson, one of the founders of the Equality House's Planting Peace charity, described the event as 'absolutely perfect'

The couple traveled from Little Rock, Arkansas to the ceremony.

Aaron Jackson, one of the founders of the Equality House's Planting Peace charity, described the  event as 'absolutely perfect.'

'The community came out in droves and just showed their support, holding up signs expressing their support for the event. It was a really incredible thing to see,' he told the New York Daily News.

Westboro Baptist Church held up vile signs and stood outside but they kept their distance. 'They're not allowed to protest a residential property,' Mr Jackson explained.

Spotlight: Same-sex marriage is not legal in Kansas, but the couple proceeded with the ceremony to raise awareness of the issue, especially in front of the Westboro Baptist Church

Although same-sex marriage is not legal in Kansas, the couple wanted to raise awareness of the issue.

The property they married in front of was bought last year by Planting Peace charity founder  Jackson, 31, and in March it was painted with the colors of the pride flag.

The little bungalow acts as the perfect counter protest to the Westboro Baptist Church who believe that the United States government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality. 

The two-bedroom house, which cost $81,000, now sits proudly directly opposite the founding base of the non-affiliated group which describes itself as a 'church'.

The guerrilla protest against the Westboro Baptists is particularly fitting given their sporadic demonstrations interrupting the funerals of dead servicemen with their odd anti-gay rhetoric and chants.

The small sect believe homosexuality is the root of all the world's evil and the refusal to denounce it is the cause of all tragedy, including deaths in war.

The Westboro Baptist Church, which is believed to have just a few dozen members, was founded in Topeka, Kansas in 1955 by Fred Phelps.
