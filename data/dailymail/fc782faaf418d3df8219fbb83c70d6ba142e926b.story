The former boyfriend of the late singer Amy Winehouse was spotted coming out of a club last night - just hours after it was revealed he has been charged with two rapes.

Reg Traviss faces two counts of rape and will appear before magistrates next month.

But last night Traviss was seen smiling as he emerged out of Soho's Groucho Club in London at 12.30am just a few hours after the allegations were made public at 1pm.

Enjoying a night out: Amy Winehouse's former boyfriend Reg Traviss emerging from the Groucho Club in Soho, London, last night just hours after it was revealed he faces two allegations of rape

The 35-year-old had been seeing the singer for more than a year when she died at her home in Camden, north London, last July.

The film director has been behind movies including Psychosis, which featured Charisma Carpenter and Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins.

Traviss, who was charged under his full name Reginald, was arrested on April 5 by the Metropolitan Police in relation to an allegation of rape reported on January 18.

Rebecca Mundy, a lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'I have authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Reginald Traviss with two counts of rape.

'The alleged offences took place between 29 December 2011 and 1 January 2012.'

The lawyer from the CPS London Rape and Serious Sexual Offences Unit added: 'The decision was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.'

He will appear at Westminster Magistratesâ€™ Court on July 17.

Last year, Traviss revealed he and Amy, who died aged 27, had been planning to get married. He admitted that he still hadn't come to terms with the fact she has gone.

Speaking
to the Sunday Times he said: 'What felt surreal was not the cameras and
the craziness but losing somebody, just like that. One minute I was 
speaking to her, the next she was gone

'You might say we were halfway through a conversation in our life together and then, suddenly, she disappeared.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
