England manager Roy Hodgson has said that he did not hear anti-IRA songs sung by the travelling support in Glasgow on Tuesday night.

The songs could be heard early in England's 3-1 win over Scotland at Celtic Park, with fans singing 'F*** the IRA' for at least five minutes.

However, Hodgson said he had long ago stopped listening to what fans are singing.

Asked about the chants on BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: 'I certainly don't have any comments to make about it, I certainly didn't hear anything.

'After a long career in football, I learnt long ago that the crowd are either signing or are silent in the background but when they chant or sing most of the time I don't have a clue.

'I thought their support was excellent. I will leave any discussion about any words they have used.'

England fans had behaved well in the build-up to the match, joining in with a minute's applause for Scotland supporter Nathan McSeveney, who died from a fall here during the Republic of Ireland match on Friday.

But once the match had begun they tainted their reputation when the anti-IRA songs began.

The Football Association will be forced to act, particularly when England are due to play in Dublin next June.
