After welcoming their 16th child into the world on June 26, the Bonell family has revealed they are happy to have even more.

Jeni, 45, and Ray Bonell, 46, from Toowoomba in Queensland, are the proud parents of 16 children, ranging in age from 24 to three until their newborn Katelyn Vera came along.

Faced with a never-ending pile of laundry, ridiculous grocery bills and having no choice but to use a former school bus for their family car, the couple told the Today show that none of those daily problems would stop them adding to their brood.

When asked if number 17 was on the way, Jeni replied 'I think it'll be a little while but hopefully yes,' before adding: 'We're just going to go along and if we are lucky enough to have another one that would be fantastic and if not, we are so grateful for what we have.'

Despite being somewhat of an expert on the process of childbirth, the latest addition to the Bonell family proved to be a very different and worrying experience for Jeni and Ray.

'We were in labour and when the doctors checked we found out the chord was out ahead of her, so it was an umbilical cord prolapse,' Jeni told the Today team.

'It was kind of all hands on deck at that point and I was rushed in for an emergency caesarean.'

Ray revealed that despite 15 children, he was amazed at his wife's recovery as well as being greatly concerned for her welfare.

'I've got new admiration for her because her recovery has been a lot harder and I've had to take on some of the housework and some of the washing and I've earned a total new respect for her this time around,' he said.

Last year Jeni, who also keeps a Facebook page for the entire family where she shares the daily pleasures and troubles of keeping up with so many children, told the Sydney Morning Herald that she is forced to use a colour code system and rosters to keep up with laundry, which children were sick and even who was getting on the bus when she picked them up from school.

Despite the numbers, the Bonell family are close and all have to pitch in to keep the household running

Jeni's Facebook posts also have her talking about the perks of having so many children, including in a Mother's Day post in which she says she was pampered: 'I am one lucky mum!'

However the daily chore of laundry no doubt appears to be the worst chore in the house, with the mother-of-sixteen sharing snaps of the pile of linen that took her two days to wash as well as her method of disciplining misbehaving children - giving them the duty of folding socks.

'Mum and dad could not possibly do all of it, so they all have jobs to do and they all help,’ Jeni said of the housework.

Finances are also clearly a struggle for the forever expanding family, who revealed to Woman's Day that they can go through up to 63 litres of milk a week.

'It's a struggle some days to afford these kids, but if you have this many kids and you love them all and take care of them , god provides for a lot of those things,' Ray told Today.

'We don't always just get things now and straight away. We have to wait for things, we have to work hard for things and once we have them we appreciate them a lot more.'
