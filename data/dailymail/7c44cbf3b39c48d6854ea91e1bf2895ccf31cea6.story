Li Hao, 35, has been executed in China for keeping six 
women as 'sex slaves' and for his role in the murder of two of them

A Chinese man has been executed for keeping six women in a dungeon as sex slaves and killing two of them, state media reported.

The official Xinhua news agency said that Li Hao had been convicted of murder, rape, illegal detention, organized prostitution and making pornography for profit in 2012.

The 35-year-old, from Henan province, was sentenced to death in March 2012 for keeping the women in his grim tiny cellar and for his role in the murder of two of them

The local government clerk had built a dungeon in his basement where he forced the women to work as prostitutes.

Police were quoted as saying that Li coerced them to kill two others who had been forced to work as sex slaves alongside them.

The death penalty had been approved by the Supreme People's Court, Xinhua said, after a higher court upheld the sentence handed down by the Luoyang Intermediate People's Court in November 2012.

Li was executed 'according to law' after meeting relatives in a detention house in Luoyang, Henan province, a statement issued by the Supreme People's Court said, according to Xinhua.

Three of the women he held were given leniency for their role in the two murders. One received three years and the two others were put on probation.

Eventually, one of the women managed to escape and she went to the police.

An investigation revealed that Li created the basement in 2009 and held the women for between two to 21 months.

During their incarceration he repeatedly raped them, forced them to have sex with other men for money and made them perform in pornographic web shows.

Before they were tricked into going to Li's dungeon, the women had all worked at nightclubs and karaoke bars.

Two of the six were found dead when a 23-year-old woman who had been kept for three months escaped while being taken out to work as a prostitute in September 2011 - she led police to the basement.

A lawyer in Changsha who was following the case said Li's death sentence was predictable, but she could not agree with the verdicts for the three women.

'I was shocked when hearing of their verdicts because they were victims in this sex-slave scandal,' Zhang Yan told the South China Morning Post.

She had attempted to represent the women in court but says she had been refused by local authorities.

She said information released by the police indicated that all the women had suffered inconceivable mental and physical torture.

China Central Television reported earlier that Li had lured them back to his underground lair after offering to pay them for sex if they went home with him. Instead he held them captive.

The court said Li was working as a clerk for Luoyang's technology supervision bureau when he was arrested in September 2011. He was married and had an eight-month-old son, Xinhua reported.
