Thomas Muller said he hopes he didn’t look stupid during the incident that led to Pepe’s dismissal in Germany’s 4-0 dismantling of Portugal.

The 24-year-old, who has now scored eight goals in seven World Cup games following his hat-trick on Monday, fell to the floor rather dramatically after being caught in the face by Pepe’s arm towards the end of the first half. 

Muller then sat clutching his face, which led to Pepe bending down and headbutting him.

Portugal were reduced to 10 men – and with Germany already 2-0 up – the game looked as good as won.

'I’d like to see it on TV,’ Muller told German television station ARD. ‘I only hope that I looked okay. I felt a blow from his fist. 

‘But what happened after that I can’t really remember, whether we were head-to-head or not. I just hope it didn’t look stupid on TV.

‘I didn’t want to cheat,’ Muller added. ‘I felt Pepe’s hit. I can’t influence a red card, and I was not playing for a red card.

‘I’ve experienced a number of things in international football matches over the last four years and I’m not the kind of guy who gets easily scared.’

The Bayern Munich forward gave Germany the lead in the 12th minute, scoring from the spot after Mario Gotze was fouled by Joao Pereira. 

Defender Mats Hummels then doubled Germany’s lead in the 32nd with a thumping header from a Toni Kroos corner. 

Muller added his second goal on the 
brink of half-time, reacting quickest to a loose ball inside the box and
 beating Rui Patricio with a low left-foot shot.

And he completed his hat-trick to make it 4-0 in the 78th minute after being played through by Chelsea attack Andre Schurrle.

‘To score three in the opening match is just awesome,’ he said. ‘Each goal was more beautiful than the last.

‘When you take the lead after 12 minutes it obviously helps you on your way. We played extremely well on the counter-attack.’

Muller is on the hunt for his second Golden Boot award after scoring five to win the award at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
