Former NSW Police Detective Sergeant Peter Moroney listened to Sharrouf's phone calls for months

When the Sydney home of convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf was raided in November 2005 police found 'thousands of images of beheaded US soldiers'.

Nine years later, Sharrouf has evaded Australian authorities and fled to Syria, where he is bragging about his own sick beheadings and even posting a photo on Twitter of his seven-year-old son holding up a severed head.

A lead investigator in Operation Pendennis, which originally busted Sharrouf as part of a large terrorist cell planning to carry out attacks in Sydney and Melbourne in 2005, has told Daily Mail Australia he always predicted Sharrouf would continue his radical beliefs once he left prison in 2009.

'Like everyone my initial reaction on seeing that image of his son was absolute disgust. But having known him, and reflecting on what we knew of him back then, it doesn't surprise me he went down this path,’ former NSW Police Detective Sergeant Peter Moroney said.

From listening in to Sharrouf’s phone conversations Mr Moroney quickly got a sense of Sharrouf’s radical beliefs.

'He would talk about his children but they were young. He’d have conversations about how the children’s grandparents were Kafir [non-believers] and he told their mother to keep them away from them.'

‘That brainwashing started from a young age,’ he said.

Mr Moroney was one of a number of detectives who listened in to Sharrouf's disturbing phone calls to friends and family in the months leading up to the dramatic raid on his house in Wiley Park, south-east Sydney, in November 2005.

After storming his home, officers found 'a vast number of documents in relation to jihad', Mr Moroney said.

'He was not a mastermind he was more of a muscle type of role,' he added.

It was one of many early morning swoops across Victoria and NSW, that involved 400 police and 23 search warrants, following an 18-month anti-terrorism operation code-named Operation Pendennis.

The operation, involving Victoria Police, ASIO and the Australian Federal Police, obtained 16,400 hours of secret recording including 98,000 phone intercepts.

Mr Moroney listened in to a large number of Sharrouf's phone calls and said he was a 'domineering' man.

He heard Sharrouf refusing to allow his parents-in-law to visit his children with wife, Tara Nettleton.

‘He often refused his Australian in-laws to visit the children because they were Catholics,’ Mr Moroney explained.

The former detective said Sharrouf spoke to his wife Tara on the phone every day.

'He was quiet a domineering person ... he was the male of the house and she was the female of the house and that’s how it was,’ he said.

Up to 17 people were arrested, including nine suspects in Melbourne and eight people in Sydney – one of whom was Sharrouf - during the November raids.

Most of the suspects were in their mid-20s and, like Sharrouf, were married with children.

Sharrouf and his blonde Australian Muslim convert wife Tara met at Chester Hill High School, before he was reportedly expelled in year nine. They both converted to Islam and got married, with Tara giving birth to their first child at the age of 17.  

The couple now have five children, who are all believed to be living in the Middle East after Tara fled Sydney. She left the country with her kids shortly after Sharrouf escaped Australian authorities by using his brother’s passport.

Khaled Sharrouf was arrested in 2005 in a raid on his Wiley Park home in Sydney's west. He was 28-years-old

He travelled to Kuala Lumpar and onto Iraq and is now believed to be fighting with Islamic State in Syria, alongside his friend Mohamed Elomar. The Australian Federal Police recently issued arrest warrants for both men.

After the raid in 2005, Sharrouf pleaded guilty in the NSW Supreme Court to possessing goods in preparation for a terrorist act and served almost four years in jail.

While appearing in court, he was deemed to be mentally unwell and classed as schizophrenic.

Tara wrote a letter to the court explaining that when he was released in 2009 they wanted to move to the country for a quiet life on a farm.

She claimed they wanted to bring up their children safely.

Mr Moroney doubts Sharrouf’s schizophrenic claims are legitimate.

'I’m no medical doctor but in addition to terrorism, he was also arrested for minor motor offences. He could have said he was schizophrenic to get off … he was certainly aware of what he needed to do manipulate the system.’

This is the house where Sharrouf lived with his wife Tara Nettleton and children before he was jailed in 2005

‘He's not intelligent … you’ve got to accept he’s been classed as schizophrenic but he seemed to function in normal life until he was arrested,’ Mr Moroney explained.

Indeed, just last week Sharrouf claimed he put on his schizophrenic symptoms to fool the criminal justice system.

‘I played the government like ignorant children,’ he said from Syria, The Australian reports. ‘I was never mentally ill, not then, nor now.’

Mr Moroney said the house that Sharrouf lived in with his wife and children was just like any other western Sydney home.

‘I think it was a three bedroom, one bathroom, style of residence and perhaps housing commission,’ he said.

Sharrouf is now believed to be fighting with the Islamic State organisation in Syria alongside fellow Sydney man Mohamed Elomar

Mr Moroney believes instead of focusing on Sharrouf's actions in Syria we should be concerned about how he became indoctrinated in Australia

Mr Moroney believes instead of focusing on Sharrouf’s actions in Syria we should be concerned about how he became indoctrinated in Australia.

'Some of the things we miss at the moment while he's over there is he was bred here, so how and why did he become so indoctrinated into such hate?

‘He was indoctrinated, groomed and trained in this country... people have got to realise that.’

Mr Moroney, who began counter-terrorism work in 2003 but left the NSW police division in 2011 to start up his own private investigations firm with his father Ken Moroney, a former NSW Commissioner of Police, also believes revoking suspects’ passports is not the answer to preventing terrorism.

Sharrouf met his blonde Australian wife Tara at Chester Hill High School, before he was reportedly expelled in year nine

‘It might stop them from going overseas and fighting but they can still plot attacks from Australia,’ he said.

The 40-year-old explained fighting terrorism is not just an issue for the police, ASIO or the Islamic community.

‘They can’t do it on their own,’ he said.

He said since he start working in counter-terrorism the work has increased ‘tenfold and it’s still increasing today’.

‘It’s not something that's going to go away. People's beliefs don't go away. You're investigating a belief system and what’s driving them is their beliefs. It’s not like drug crimes that are motivated by money or greed. It’s hard to police.’
