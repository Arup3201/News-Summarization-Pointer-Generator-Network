A woman whose baby's foot was found stashed in the refrigerator of a 'House of Horrors' abortion clinic three years after the procedure has spoken out about her terrifying ordeal.

Desiree Hawkins, who was just 16 at the time, is just one of the patients who has come forward to recount their horrifying experiences at the Women's Medical Society in Philadelphia.

Women, including one who was left infertile by the treatment, have described blood-splattered floors and procedure 
rooms, as well as aggressive staff who acted as if they just wanted their money.

The accounts of what allegedly happened at the hands of the clinic's owner, Dr Kermit Gosnell, come as the prosecution rests in his murder trial after six weeks of testimony.

Gosnell, 72, is charged with killing four infants during botched abortions as well as a 41-year-old woman who died of an overdose after a procedure. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.

Painful: Desiree Hawkins, a former patient of Dr Kermit Gosnell, recounts her ordeal at his abortion clinic. She said detectives called her three years later to reveal her baby's foot was found in a fridge

Now, through the 3801 Lancaster Film Project
 - a collection of movies committed to exposing the horrors at the 
clinic - some of the women who were treated by Gosnell have shared their
 stories.

Hawkins was a high school student when she learned she was pregnant and, after a clinic in Maryland found she was 19 weeks along, she was sent to Dr Gosnell for a late-term abortion.

She underwent the procedure on December 4, 2009 - unaware that just 15 days before, Karnamaya Mongar had died following an abortion at the clinic.

'I remember coming to as I was laying on 
the bed... having a young girl standing next to me and the only reason I
 was waking up was because I kept vomiting all over myself,' Hawkins said.

Last resort: When a Maryland clinic found she was 19 weeks pregnant, they gave her Gosnell's pamphlet

Disturbing: Detectives told her that her baby's foot is pictured right in this photo taken at the clinic

'I remember him picking up something and walking out the room.'

Hawkins said she struggled to come to terms with giving up her baby, but always knew she was too young to become a mother and her own mother would be unable to provide for them.

No one apart from her mother knew of the abortion for three years - until she received a call from Philadelphia detectives, telling her that Dr Gosnell was being investigated for horrors at the clinic.

It was then that she learned her baby's foot had been found in a fridge at the clinic.

'You don't even know how to respond when 
you find a human has kept a foot of your baby,' she told the film project. 'You don't know how to 
answer that. You just want to cry. You just don't want to believe it and
 I still don't.'

Another patient, Davida Clarke, said that she too is left with painful memories of her experience at the clinic - and claimed that, because of what happened there, she can no longer have children.

Nowhere to turn: Davida Clarke said she went to the clinic after she was raped when she was younger

Alone: When Clarke, pictured, begged the staff to stop, she said Dr Gosnell shouted: 'Stop being a baby!'

Clarke went to the clinic after she fell in with 'the wrong crowd' and was raped - but said she never received the caring, supportive environment she craved.

'You had a receptionist that just... all she wanted was your money immediately,' she told the film project. 'I came in... I remember walking through and looking and seeing some women who looked half dead in these bloody recliner chairs and there was blood all over the floor.'

She explained that she first saw Dr Gosnell when she was attached to IVs and having doubts about the procedure. She said that she told the staff she couldn't go through with it.

'He's like, "Oh stop being a little baby" and he's pounding on my legs, "Stop being a little baby! Stop being a little baby!"' she said.  'And I'm outnumbered because all these women came in and I'm tied to the bed and the next thing I knew, I was out of it.'

When she came to, she began crying and begging for her baby, but was ignored, she said.

Charged: Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor, is accused of killing 4 babies allegedly born alive

'I can't have babies as a result,' she added. 'I'm married - I have a daughter that wants a brother or a sister and I can't give her that. I want a child. I can't have that.'

And in yet more horrifying details, 
another patient, who was only identified as Makeda, said staff at the 
clinic led her to believe that abortions were a viable form of 
contraception.

One nurse even assured her that Brazilian women have at least 21 abortions each, she said.

'It was the norm for me after she had coached me,' she said. 'In the next 14 years I had eight abortions. I look back at it and I'm like, "What was I thinking?"'

Their stories come as prosecutors gave their closing arguments in Gosnell's trial on Monday. He is accused of cutting babies' necks with scissors to ensure their demise after botched procedures.

In court, Assistant District Attorney
 Ed Cameron turned to Gosnell and asked, 'Are you human?' - but the 
doctor simply stared back and laughed.

Tragic: He faces a murder charge in the overdose death of Karnamaya Mongar, left, who died in 2009

'My dog was treated better than those babies and women,' Cameron said.

He added that Mongar's death was the result of Gosnell's 'assembly line' treatment of patients.

The defense questioned testimony from staffers who said they had seen babies move, cry or breathe.

Gosnell's defense lawyer, John McMahon, argued that each testified to seeing only a single movement or breath.

'These are not the movements of a live child,' McMahon said. 'There is not one piece - not one - of objective, scientific evidence that anyone was born alive.'

But the prosecutor questioned why 
else Gosnell and his staff would 'snip' babies if they were not born 
alive. The brains were intact, so it was not done to make the delivery 
easier, he said.

Discarded: Bags stashed with body parts, pictured, were also found in the Philadelphia clinic

'Why would you cut a baby in the back of the neck unless you were killing it?' Cameron argued.

Former
 staffers have testified that patients received heavy sedatives and 
painkillers from untrained workers while Gosnell was offsite, and were 
then left in waiting rooms for hours, often unattended.

A
 2011 grand jury report alleges that dozens of women were injured at 
Gosnell's clinic over the past 30 years, calling it a ‘house of 
horrors.’

Some
 left with torn wombs or bowels, some with venereal disease contracted 
through the reuse of non-sterilized equipment, and some left with fetal 
remains still inside them, the report alleged.

Employees
 at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their 
mothers into the toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be 
removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.'

Operating table: Women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet

No escape: Mongar allegedly died after staff had been unable to open this side door for an hour

And
 in a 300-page grand jury report, that initially laid out the charges 
against Gosnell, details the appalling conditions of the West 
Philadelphia clinic the doctor operated.

It
 was described as reeking of cat urine, with walls splattered with blood
 and patient rooms filled with unsanitary instruments and broken- down 
equipment.

The
 tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout 
Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, 
even cat-food containers.

Jars with severed feet lined shelves, prosecutors said. 'It was a baby charnel house,' the grand jury report said.

Gosnell
 has been in jail since his January 2011 arrest. Eight other defendants 
have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and are awaiting sentencing.
