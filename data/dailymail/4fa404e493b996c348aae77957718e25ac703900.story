Britain basked in wonderful sunshine today with temperatures soaring to a glorious 23C, and the great news is there's even better to come.

The mercury peaked at around 23C in Woodvale near Blackpool, but most of the country finally got to enjoy a proper taste of summer after a wet and miserable spring.

And Scotland didn't miss out either with Glasgow one of the hottest places. Locals packed into  Kelvingrove Park where it hit a sweltering 22C.

It will get steadily warmer across the country throughout the week with temperatures nudging 25C expected in London on Friday.

'But the sunshine will develop 
throughout the day with most parts experiencing dry and warm weather 
although there will be a few sharp showers in Scotland and parts of 
Northern England and Northern Ireland.

a few scattered showers in the south but temperatures in London are
