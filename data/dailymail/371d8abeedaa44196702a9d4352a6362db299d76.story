It seems appropriate that the American city famed for its heat should stage a match between English football’s most fierce rivals.

The suggestion that the Miami final of this International Champions Cup, contested by Manchester United and Liverpool, will be a friendly affair seems wishful.

For each team it marks an opportunity to flex muscles and score an early boost ahead of the season proper. For once, United will enter from the more humble position with Liverpool looking down.

Tactical genius: New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has imposed a 5-3-2 formation on his team

But there is a new manager in the Old Trafford dugout and initial indications are Louis Van Gaal may have the charisma and ingenuity to turn the club around.

Liverpool have lost Luis Suarez but Brendan Rodgers is acquiring plenty of players to compensate. 

Here are how the best starting line-ups currently available to either boss might look and rate. 

Moving on: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will be without Luis Suarez following his sale to Barcelona in July

Manchester United - Formation: 3-5-2

July 26: Beat Roma 3-2 - Denver

July 29: Drew 0-0 Inter (pens win) - Landover

August 2: Beat Real Madrid 3-1  - Ann Arbor

Team Total: 83 

David de Gea - Rating 8.5  

One player to emerge from last season’s wreckage with an enhanced reputation and looks in prime nick. Capable of stunning saves and increasingly commanding of his area.

Safe hands: David de Gea's unquestionable shot-stopping makes his Manchester United's No 1

Chris Smalling - 6.5

Has suffered from operating at right back through necessity during his time at Old Trafford but Van Gaal’s new system offers him a chance to flourish at centre back. He must take it.

Up for it: Chris Smalling (left) has finally got the chance to flourish at centre-back in Louis van Gaal's team

Jonny Evans - 7

At 26, he is now the elder statesman of United’s defence since the departures of Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra and is being considered for a captaincy role. Big responsibility on his shoulders. 

Veteran: At 26, Jonny Evans (left) is United's oldest and most experienced centre back 

Phil Jones - 6.5

Another who has not kicked on as hoped, partly through being shuffled around the pitch. Central defence has always looked his most natural position so now has a regular opportunity to fulfill that potential. 

Crunching challenge: Like Smalling, Phil Jones (left) will get a chance to shine at centre back

Antonio Valencia - 7.5

Able to slot seamlessly into the right wing back slot by virtue of his strength, pace and stamina. One of the players you imagine Van Gaal would be able to improve in a formation that may suit. 

Reborn: Antonio Valencia (left) looks tailor-made for the right wing back role under Van Gaal

Luke Shaw - 7

Must get his fitness up to peak standard before he can become the marauding wing back United desperately need. His powerful running should add dynamism to the left flank. 

Star in the making: United paid Southampton £31million for Luke Shaw (top) this summer

Michael Carrick - 7.5

Ankle injury will rule him out for the opening weeks of the season but once back will bring much-required experience and link from defence to attack. Van Gaal wants his players to be rounded individuals and he fits that mould.

Early blow: Michael Carrick will miss the start of United's season after undergoing ankle surgery

Ander Herrera - 8

Has shown in an impressive pre-season how he can provide drive and creativity from midfield. Expressive on the pitch and off it, and entering his prime at 24 years old. 

Baller: Ander Herrera (centre) has fitted seamlessly in United's first-team since his move from Athletic Bilbao

Juan Mata - 8.5

United’s midfield produced an alarmingly slim amount of goals in recent years but the Spaniard seems likely to continue where he left off at the end of last season. Silky presence with cutting edge. 

Revitalised: Juan Mata (centre) scored in United's 3-2 pre-season win against Roma in July

Wayne Rooney - 8

No chance of him being shifted to the left in Van Gaal’s preferred formation. Striker will be in his preferred role and that clarity could yield big results. 

This could be a defining season, with a manager who will neither pander nor ostracise. 

Point to prove: Wayne Rooney is in contention to be van Gaal's captain next season

Robin van Persie - 8

Once recuperated from World Cup he should be back to his best under the compatriot with whom he shares a strong bond. Produced magical moments in Brazil and threatens to return to form of 2012-13.  

Top dog: Van Gaal's hopes Van Persie replicates his Holland World Cup form in a United shirt next season

July 27: Beat Olympiacos 1-0 - Chicago

July 30: Drew 2-2 Man City (pens win) - New York

August 2: Beat Milan 2-0 - Charlotte

Liverpool - Formation: 4-3-3

Team Total: 83.5  

Simon Mignolet - 6.5 

Coped reasonably well with making the step up to a club chasing the title last term but must increase his level of command. An excellent shot-stopper but is liable to mistakes howler.

Step up: Simon Mignolet has to work on commanding his area in the Liverpool box

Glen Johnson - 6

The influx of full backs, his form, and his age - 29 - combine to put his place at jeopardy. With one year left on his contract Liverpool might cash in. But as things stand he has the right-back slot. 

Under pressure: Glen Johnson (left) faces competition for a starting spot at right back for Liverpool

Dejan Lovren - 7.5

Got his way with move from Southampton but now must prove worth the £20m price-tag and all the fuss. A commanding defender who could fill void left by Jamie Carragher. 

All smiles: Dejan Lovren joined Liverpool in a £20million transfer last month from Southampton

Mamadou Sakho - 8

Showed enough at World Cup to suggest he could become Rodgers' No 1 centre back. Troubled by injury last season but provides pace and power as well as being comfortable on the ball. 

Beast: Mamadou Sakho's pace and power makes him a welcome addition to Brendan Rodgers' defence

Jon Flanagan - 7.5

Academy graduate became a cult hero on Merseyside for his fearless displays last season but his position comes under threat from Alberto Moreno’s imminent arrival. Could switch to right back. 

Cult hero: Jon Flanagan (second right) endeared himself to the Kop last season with his fearless displays

Steven Gerrard - 7.5

At 34 is spurred on by the worst three months of his career. Errors cost Liverpool and England but he will thrive on driving through Rodgers’ evolution and leading his club in Europe once more. 

Captain Marvel: Steven Gerrard (left) will be hoping to skipper Liverpool to their first-ever Premier League title

Jordan Henderson - 8

A revelation last term, bringing energy, smart passing and occasional goals to Liverpool’s midfield. Despite reinforcements should keep his place as a box-to-box player. 

Mr Energy: Jordan Henderson's (left) box-to-box qualities make him play a pivotal role in Liverpool's midfield

Philippe Coutinho - 8.5

A little gem of a player at the point of midfield. Operates in the spaces between the lines and, with Suarez departed, will be looked upon to provide the magic that unlocks tight defences. 

Clever clogs: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has hailed Philippe Coutinho (right) as the 'brain of the team'

Adam Lallana - 7.5

Has never appeared daunted in his career, be it Premier League football with Southampton or his debut for England. Now has stage to show off his talents although it will be intriguing to see how he is used. 

Mystery man: £25million summer signing Adam Lallana (left) will miss the start of the season through injury

Raheem Sterling - 8.5

Emerged from dips last season to become a vital player in the run-in, capable of adapting from the wing to the middle. His decision making is improving while natural skills and speed a match for anyone. 

One to watch: Raheem Sterling (right) performances at Liverpool earned him a World Cup spot this summer

Daniel Sturridge- 8

Scored the goals this time last season when Suarez was suspended and must now repeat. How he adjusts to role as premier striker will be interesting but chances are he will progress again. 

Instinctive: Daniel Sturridge (left) will be expected to score the majority of Liverpool's goals this season
