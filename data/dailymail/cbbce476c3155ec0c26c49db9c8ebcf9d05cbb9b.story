Online relations: 'Allie' Loftis was located by police Wednesday at the residence of a 45-year-old man she reportedly met online

Police arrested a 42-year-old man harboring a runaway 13-year-old Massachusetts girl at his New Jersey home Wednesday.

Police say Alexandra "Allie" Loftis vanished from her Boston home for nearly two weeks after boarding a bus headed to New York City on November 4th, sending her parents on a relentless hunt to get their daughter back.

Allie was located at Jorge Garzon's Jersey City residence and taken into police custody around 9 am Wednesday, after police say they received a tip off.

Garzon, who also goes by the name George Gonzalez, was arrested just over an hour after her recovery at the Jersey address.

Affirming Allie's father's fear, the two are believed to have met online, a sources close to the investigation told NJ.com.

Allie's family had searched long and hard
 for their daughter, never giving up hope, with their efforts rippling 
throughout the New York area to local police stations, city streets and 
across social media sites showing a number of various fliers.

Believing
 she had run away independently, her parents posted numerous messages to
 her on Facebook, as well as pictures of them together, imploring her to
 come home.

Her father admitted that before her disappearance she seemed unhappy in school, but thought it was just a rough patch.

'I live in semi-rural community where it's peaceful and quiet, and she wanted 
big city, bright lights,' Mr Loftis said. 'She wanted to go to school in a 
different area. As she said, where we live is boring.'

Pleading, in hope that she may see their efforts and pain online, the family devoted a Facebook site to their missing daughter, posting a flood of photos of them together.

'One of many trips to get ice cream w dad,' her father, Tony Loftis, wrote above one picture of the two of them together.

'I luv u honey, pls let us know u r ok,' he wrote.

Adventure: Allie, shown with her father and mother, had expressed frustration and boredom with their quieter Massachusetts community to her father, possibly building up to her New York City escape

Search: Allie's parents searched all the areas of the city they thought their daughter might go, focusing on Brooklyn where they knew she was more familiar

Following their daughter's trail the family traveled to New York City, chasing any and all leads of their daughter.

Every location they thought she might go - from the Barnes and Noble in Park Slope Brooklyn to Prospect Park, both locations her father said he knew she loved - they handed out fliers and recruited volunteers.

And with him having family in Brooklyn, the father hoped it's where she would be.

Efforts: Family of Allie implored volunteers to take to street corners in matching T-shirts handing out fliers on their missing daughter, all around the city

'Whenever I’m focused on trying to find 
her, I’m okay. But, whenever that stops, and I’m home at night, and I wake up in 
the morning, and I think, you know, I … I … I … it’s hard,' Mr Loftis told CBS Boston.

'You know this is 
completely devas… you can’t … it’s my only daughter,' he said.

Asking volunteers to take two Saturdays out of the next six to stand on street corners in matching T-shirts and fliers, the family's plan was to 'create a media event to help bring Allie home for the holidays,' her parents wrote in an email to volunteers, according to the Wayland Patch.

'We think 
the only way to put pressure on the person holding her, and to keep the leads 
coming, is to sustain media coverage,' they wrote.

But after their daughter disappeared, Mr Loftis says she never turned on her cell phone or went on Facebook, despite him describing her as tech savvy.

'We have left voice mail messages on her cell phone until it got filled up. We’ve 
tried every method we think possible but haven’t heard from her,' Mr Loftis told CBS after her disappearance.

That made it even more concerning for him, with his fear that Allie could have been held against her will.

Her father did confess his believe that she may have met someone online.

Garzon, who Allie was found with, is currently being held in custody in the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office pending charges which have yet to be filed.

The circumstances surrounding both her disappearance and the activities since she ran away are still under investigation, according to police. 

Growing attacks: Charges against the man Allie was found staying with have yet to be filed while the case remains an open investigation as police say cyber attacks on youth is a growing concern

Custody: Police say Allie took a bus from Boston Massachusetts to New York City, disappearing for nearly two weeks before she was found Wednesday in Jersey City
