Chelsea captain John Terry is back in pre season training - but for the first time in 13 years he is undergoing the hard work ahead of a Premier League campaign without Frank Lampard alongside him.

With Chelsea's vice-captain departing at the end of his contract this summer, Terry has been left to start the season without the man he calls his 'best mate' at the club.

But the Blues have been busy in the transfer window already this summer and their captain is expecting a silverware challenge and reserved particular praise for their new midfielder and 'very good signing' Cesc Fabregas.

'It feels different coming in and Lamps 
not being sat next to me,' Terry told Chelsea's official magazine.

'We have sat next to each other in the changing
 room since... well, since he signed for the club really. I’ve become 
really close to Lamps and Ash and they were my two best mates at the 
club.

'So I’m really sad to see arguably the best player the club has 
ever had, in Lamps, move on, for what he brought to the dressing room 
and as a mate.

'You understand that you all get older, but you just hope that point doesn’t come.'

But Terry,
 who came on as a substitute for Chelsea in a pre season friendly at 
Wycombe Wanderers on Wednesday, is backing Jose Mourinho's Lampard 
replacement to fill the Chelsea legend's boots.

Cesc
 Fabregas starts training with the Blues on Monday, after returning from
 his post-World Cup holidays, and Terry believes the 27-year-old will be
 a huge success at Stamford Bridge, despite his past at London rivals 
Arsenal.

'He’s a very good signing,' Terry said. 'He is great on the ball, a great box-to-box player, he scores an awful lot of goals as well and he has got an aggressive streak in him too – I certainly remember that from his Arsenal days.

'I’m sure he is going to fit in really well at Chelsea and do well in the years to come.'

And Terry is bullish when it comes to talking about his side's title chances in what could be his last year at Stamford Bridge.

'I think we should be very competitive,' he said. 'We were close last year, but just unlucky at times. With the signings we have made and a couple of younger players who I think will surprise a few people this year.

'I think this should be a very good year. We want to win trophies – that is always the aim from the outset for me.

'I can see a lot more teams in the mix. First and foremost, though, we need to be solid, both home and away, because I think we dropped too many points against teams we shouldn’t have.'
