These beautiful long-exposure photographs offer a novel twist on the too-often shamelessly narcissistic trend for 'selfie' pictures which is sweeping the internet.

Paul Zizka, 34, has put his own slant on the celebrity-led photographic genre, made popular by photo-sharing website Instagram, by including his silhouette in these dramatic shots of the Canadian wilderness.

Rather that a vainglorious attempt to propel himself to 15 minutes of internet fame, his inclusion of himself in the shots is an attempt to show the relationship between a mere man and the awesome natural world surrounding him.

Mr Zizka, from Alberta, one of Canada's three so-called Prairie provinces, began experimenting with night photography just two years ago.

Captivated by the spectacular scenes of his home region, he nevertheless decided that to create photographs which were more unique he add the context of the human form into the shot.

Using long exposures, allowing the night's sky illuminating the mountains around him, he has sought to create a relationship between the central figure in the image and the nature around him.

Mr Zizka's photographs showcase breathtaking sights from the the Banff National Park and Kootenay National Park, both in the Canadian Rockies.

Usually venturing out into the wilderness alone, his project is on-going as he gets new ideas every day for how to record himself in remarkable locations.

Mr Zizka said: 'I was introduced to the magic of night photography somewhat accidentally on mountaineering trips that required very early starts.

'I was amazed by the quiet and beauty of a night spent high in the mountains.

'Eventually, I ended up shooting more at night than during the day and I still take great pleasure in trying to document the magic that the stars, the moon and the aurora bring to a scene.

'I find that a photograph can sometimes convey so much more, or at least a very different feel if a person is included in the scene.

'I like the relationship between man and mountain that it instantly creates. So I think including myself in the images helps people relate to a photograph, even though some have never been anywhere near the location.'
