A tonne of heroin worth almost £160million has been found hidden inside sacks of cement on a tiny sailing boat in the Indian Ocean.

The crew of an Australian warship intercepted the dhow 27 nautical miles east of the Kenyan port city of Mombasa and discovered the drugs stowed in 46 separate bags.

The seizure is largest ever in the history of the Combined Maritime Forces, a joint operation between 30 countries to combat piracy, militancy and smuggling in the waters east of Africa.

Haul: More than a tonne of heroin worth £160million has been seized from a small boat in the Indian Ocean

Dramatic: The moment crews approached the dhow, which was filled with sacks of cement as cover

The frigate HMAS Darwin intercepted 
the vessel on Wednesday night and confiscated 1,023 kg  of heroin, according to Australia's Defence Department.

The drugs were destroyed, the online statement said.

'This is a major heroin seizure, which has removed a major source of funding from terrorist criminal networks,' said the ship's commanding officer Commander Terry Morrison.

The coup came as part of the joint 
operation's bid to preserve order in a huge region spanning the Red Sea,
 Gulf of Aden, Arabian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean and the Gulf of 
Oman.

The area includes the waters off 
Somalia's Horn of Africa, which have been blighted by piracy including 
several high-profile hijackings of British yachts.

Kenyan defence spokesman Bogita Ongeri told Nigeria's Saturday Nation that the haul was not seized within Kenya’s territorial waters.

'I can authoritatively say that the seizure of such heroin never happened within our Exclusive Economic Zone,' he said.

'We are doing daily surveillance within our territorial waters and we have not received such a report.'

News agencies described the vessel as a dhow, a traditional African and Middle Eastern sailing boat, although no sails were erected when it was photographed by the Australian Navy.

There has been a surge in the volumes of heroin trafficked through eastern Africa in the past few years, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

Heroin is typically routed through the region - known for its porous borders and weak maritime surveillance - from Pakistan and Iran on its way to Europe.

More illegal narcotics were seized in Africa in the first five months of 2013 than in the previous two years, the UNODC said.

This month, a Canadian battleship patrolling the Indian Ocean seized 130kg of heroin from a dhow 100 nautical miles east of Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, and last year a Canadian warship confiscated 500kg of heroin from a dhow more than 300 nautical miles off Zanzibar.

The southwestern Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden are also used by bands of pirates from Somalia, as well as human traffickers.
