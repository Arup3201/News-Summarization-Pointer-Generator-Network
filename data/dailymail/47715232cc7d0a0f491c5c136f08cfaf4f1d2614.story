The Copa del Rey second leg was marred by a cigarette lighter being thrown at Cristiano Ronaldo as he headed for the tunnel at half-time but, on the pitch, the Portuguese striker had the last laugh.

He scored two penalties, the second won by Gareth Bale, as Madrid beat Atletico 2-0 on the night and 5-0 on aggregate to go through to the April 19 final.

Going in at the break at the Vicente Calderon, a yellow cigarette lighter flew through the air and hit the Portugal captain on top of his head.

Incoming: The yellow lighter can be seen hurtling through the air towards Ronaldo's head

Oblivious: Ramos (centre), Xabi Alonso (right) and Ronaldo are entirely unaware as the missile is thrown

Hitting home: The lighter lands on top of Ronaldo's crown with some force

Withdrawal: Ronaldo was taken off in the 75th minute for wonderkid Jese

Atletico Madrid: Aranzubia, Miranda, Insua, Alderweireld, Javi Manquillo (Juanfran 46), Diego (Adrian 46), Mario Suarez, Raul Garcia (Gabi 61), Rodriguez, Sosa, Koke

Subs not used: Godin, Turan, Bounou, Ruben Mesa

Booked: Miranda

Real Madrid: Casillas, Sergio Ramos (Nacho 46), Arbeloa, Daniel Carvajal, Varane, Xabi Alonso, Modric (Casemiro 67), Bale, Illarramendi, Isco, Ronaldo (Jese 75)

Subs not used: Pepe, Benzema, Di Maria, Lopez

Booked: Arbeloa, Illaramendi, Ronaldo

Goals: Ronaldo 7 (pen), 16 (pen) 

Ronaldo was walking off alongside 
team-mates Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso, who showed concern as the 
striker clutched his head after impact.

The missile was thrown from a section of the home support as players from both sides passed down into the tunnel.

Bale, meanwhile, emulated David Beckham by reaching the Spanish Cup final in his first season at Real Madrid.

Beckham’s
 first and only cup final in Spain was against Zaragoza which Madrid 
lost 3-2 in extra time despite the then England captain scoring with a 
first-half free-kick.

Bale’s
 first final is more likely to be against Barcelona who lead Real 
Sociedad 2-0 after the first leg and meet on Wednesday night in San 
Sebastian.

The Wales winger has already
 passed Beckham’s first-season goals and assists tally. In the 2003-04 
season Beckham scored seven goals, Bale has 11.

Beckham’s
 assist count in the league was up to eight in the 32 games he played; 
Bale has only played nine full matches for Madrid but has nine assists.

The £86million man was brought down in the box by Emiliano Insua and Ronaldo scored from 
the spot doubling Real Madrid's lead on the night after the Portuguese 
forward had won and dispatched the first penalty.

Dani
 Aranzubia pushed a Bale free-kick round his post in one of Real 
Madrid’s best second-half chances but the tie had been won a week 
earlier in the Santiago Bernabeu.

Madrid reaching the cup final also means Ancelotti repeats Jose Mourinho’s feat in his first season in charge of Real Madrid.

Mourinho also met Barcelona in the final and won his first trophy thanks to an extra-time header from Ronaldo.

Madrid’s
 two goals in the Calderon took Ancelotti closer to another of 
Mourinho’s milestones. Real scored 100 goals under the current Chelsea 
manager in just 42 games but Ancelotti’s Madrid have now scored 98 in 
the Italian’s first 37 matches.

Ronaldo hit a shot straight at Aranzubia to just miss out on his hat-trick and was substituted midway through the second half.

Atletico
 Madrid could now face punishment from the league for the missile thrown
 at the Real Madrid striker, although the precedents for action being 
taken against clubs in such circumstances will not encourage those who 
want tough action.

Diego Simeone’s side will now concentrate on the league, the Champions League and getting back key injured players.

They
 had full back Javier Manquillo taken to hospital with a cervical sprain
 after falling on his head and twisting his neck after jumping for a 
header with Ronaldo who was booked.

In the first leg last Wednesday, Real 
left back Marcelo and his young son were reportedly targeted with racist
 taunts from the travelling Atletico fans as the Brazil defender warmed 
down following the ill-tempered game at the Santiago Bernabeu.
