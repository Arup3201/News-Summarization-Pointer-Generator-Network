Raonel Valdez-Valhuerdis (pictured), 34, was booked into the Miami-Dade County Jail on Wednesday

A man accused of stealing more than 100 pounds of gold worth nearly $3 million in South Florida is back in the U.S. after being captured in Belize.

Raonel Valdez-Valhuerdis, 34, was booked into the Miami-Dade County Jail on Wednesday, the U.S. Marshalls Service reported.

He was detained in February by Belize immigration officials at the Guatemala-Belize border.

He was spotted crawling through bush scrub by the Guatemala border and was carrying a Cuban passport, CNN reported.

Authorities say Valdez and two other men robbed a Bolivian export company employee outside a Coral Gables apartment building in Miami in October 2012.

The gold, worth an estimated $2.8 million, was on its way to an Opa-Locka refinery when he allegedly held up a man carrying the gold in suitcases.

Valdez was arrested shortly after the robbery.

Valdez was free on $75,000 bail in March 2013 when authorities lost track of his GPS monitor, and he disappeared.

He was wearing an ankle monitor from a previous arrest at the time of his capture.

Valdez allegedly assaulted and tried to rob his ex-girlfriend five months prior to the gold heist.

He was ordered to wear the ankle monitor after being convicted of battery.
