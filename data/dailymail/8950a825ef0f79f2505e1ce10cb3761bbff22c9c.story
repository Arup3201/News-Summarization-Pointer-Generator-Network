A University of South Carolina fraternity was placed on suspension Wednesday after the 'suspicious death' of an 18-year-old member at a house where the brothers lived.

The identity of the deceased Pi Kappa Alpha (aka PIKE) member has not yet been released, but he was reportedly found unconscious at the frat's house on Lee Street around 10:30am. 

Neighbors told Fox Carolina that the house threw a party the night before and on Wednesday there was still a keg and St Patrick's Day decorations outside the home.

Suspended: The Pi Kappa Alpha house at the University of South Carolina has been suspended, after a brother was found dead in a house Wednesday morning

Rager? Neighbors said the house had a party the night before, on St Patrick's Day. On Wednesday, several stray cups and a keg were seen on the porch, as well as clover decorations

'I would say there are three houses there, and I don't know who exactly lives in them, but there's always a frequency of parties going on,' neighbor Mehrdad Vejdani said. 

'At times, there can be a hundred people in that place. Live band in the backyard, which is fine. I mean, some noise, but it doesn't bother us too much.'

While the Columbia Police Department and Richland County Coroner's Office labeled the death as 'suspicious,' authorities said there was no signs of foul play or trauma on the body. 

An autopsy and toxicology test are scheduled for Thursday. 

Responding the tragic incident, PIKE's national office released a statement saying the USC chapter had been placed on leave pending the investigation. 

'The fraternity’s thoughts and prayers are with the family of this young man and the brothers of Xi Chapter,' the statement read. 

'There are a lot of rumors out there about the circumstances surrounding the death but at this point the matter remains under investigation,' University of South Carolina spokesman Wes Hickman said. 'While we await further information we are focused on helping our community grieve and heal.'

This is just the second incident at a PIKE house this week. Last Friday, the University of Connecticut chapter lost recognition for hazing members, providing alcohol to underage students and harassing women. 

PIKE was founded in 1868 at the University of Virginia and has now grown to include some 220 groups across the U.S. and Canada. 

The house has been plagued by controversy before. 

In November 2012, a 19-year-old student at Northern Illinois University died after a night of heavy drinking. Five frat members were charged with felonies for hazing and the chapter was suspended indefinitely. 

That same year, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville chapter was suspended indefinitely when a 20-year-old member was hospitalized for reportedly ingesting wine through his anus.
