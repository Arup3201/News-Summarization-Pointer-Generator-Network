My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson has been at the centre of controversy this week, after his ex-wife claimed in a TV interview that he's a 'deadbeat dad' who doesn't see or support his kids.

Following the explosive A Current Affair interview, TV WEEK published quotes from the former tennis professional discussing his difficult divorce, saying the situation 'is not ideal'.

'Obviously I'd like to spend more time with them,' he told the magazine.

'Deadbeat dad'? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson spoke to TV WEEK magazine about his difficult divorce and wanting to 'spend more time with them [his kids]'

However, Channel Seven claim the TV WEEK interview was done prior to Adam's ex-wife's interview earlier this week and the article has since been taken off their website. 

At the time the former tennis pro had said: 'Any split from a former wife is going to be tough and yeah it is tough,' he said, adding: 'Things end because both parties are unhappy.'

'If everything was great we’d still be together.'

In the explosive interview, Cindy Anderson claimed the former tennis pro hadn't seen his children in approximately a year and owes close to $40,000 in child support.

Cindy also claimed her ex is friends with one of the show's judges, Pete Evans, which she calls a 'conflict of interest'.

Owing child support: Cindy Anderson told A Current Affair on Monday night that he owes their five children approximately twelve months worth of child support, amounting to tens of thousands of dollars

A Channel Seven spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia in response to Cindy's claims: 'This is a private matter between the parties involved.'  

Channel Seven also refuted the assertion, that Adam and Pete are friends: 'They [Adam and Pete] met for the first time on the program'.

Adam's former wife of almost 20 years, told A Current Affair on Monday night that she was speaking out on the show instead of dealing with the matter privately because, 'He has blocked my number and both his childrens' numbers - the older two girls have phones'.

Adam's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married Carol Molloy - his partner on the Channel 7 reality show - but she claims that's when her issues with child support payments began.

Cindy also claimed that Adam used to coach My Kitchen Rules judge Pete on the tennis court and that Adam worked at Pete's Kings Cross restaurant Hugo's, in Sydney, after she split with him.

'He has known Pete Evans, he knows him through tennis, through coaching him,' Cindy told reporter Brady Halls. 

'We get no financial support at all,' she also told Brady.

Cindy claims her concern is  that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year, which she says 'worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father.'

'The children also have no emotional support from him. He does not ring them, nor come and see them,' she said, adding 'they do not receive a card [for birthdays] in the mail, not even a phone call.'

'He's never played an active, massive role in their lives anyway...but basically his role now is non-existent, he's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children,' Cindy said.

Upset: The blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after Adam's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters

The blonde single mother also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it's 'significantly impacting on the children'.

Cindy not only took aim at Adam during the interview but also at the Child Support Agency and producers of My Kitchen Rules.

'It seems there is little they [child support agency] can do, irrespective of him being in the print that he's working at three private schools doing tennis, irrespective of his face being on My Kitchen Rules.

'They consistently say there is no source of collection, there is no avenue for us to collect revenue,' she said.

Spokesman and General Manager for the Department of Human services, who over-sees the Child Support Agency, Hank Jongen told Brady: 'I can't talk about individual cases but let me assure you, that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations.'

'We will do whatever it takes to recover that money,' he added.

While Cindy claims she wrote to producers of the show to find out if he was being paid for his appearances to garnish money from his wages, she was left without a response.

Channel Seven have said in their statement that they never received that letter.
