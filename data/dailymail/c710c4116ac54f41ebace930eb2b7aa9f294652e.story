A man who allegedly decapitated his neighbour strolled on to a film set days later and auditioned for a role in a thriller.

In a bizarre twist, Jonathon Stenberg landed the part of a policeman in Mystery Road, which was shooting in a remote Queensland town, while officers were trying to track him down.

Producers of the film 
contacted the media in the hope of gaining some publicity for the project and shedding light on Stenberg's movements before he was captured.

The film's assistant director Mark 
Ingram told Australia's Daily Telegraph that the crew and a cast 
including Hugo Weaving, Jack Thompson and True Blood star Ryan Kwanten 
were still in shock over their unlikely encounter with Stenberg.

'We're all still a little shaken by it, it was just totally bizarre,' said Mr Ingram.

Stenberg was arrested on Sunday by New South Wales Police in a 
remote bush hideout, south of Darwin, after one of the largest manhunts in 
the Northern Territory's history.

Police allege he murdered Edward Kelly at 
his Broadwater home on June 21, and left a hat in place of where his 
head should have been.

Stenberg appeared in Darwin Magistrate's
Court today, where police successfully sought an extradition order 
to send him back to Sydney, where he will be formally charged.

On the morning of June 23, Mr Ingram was pinning up posters outside the North Gregory Hotel in the tiny rural township of Winton asking locals to audition as extras, when Stenberg wandered up.

Mr Ingram said: 'This gentleman came up and said hi, said he was passing through town and wanted to earn a few extra dollars.

'We weren't quite ready to take people in yet, so he said he'd go and buy me a coffee and come back in 20 minutes.'

Stenberg returned to the local pub with coffees and biscuits, and Mr Ingram welcomed him in for an audition.

'He was the first one through the door, so he was number one,' he said.

The suspect told the producers and director he had extensive experience in the military, was trained in weapons use and had served in Afghanistan.

'He was great. Very polite and well-spoken and he seemed really keen to help out on the film wherever he could,' added Mr Ingram.

Stenberg said he had no fixed address, other than the back of his truck, but said he had a builders licence and could help with any props building that might be needed.

Impressed with Stenberg's audition and what he had to offer, Mr Ingram emailed him to offer him a role.

'Ironically, because of his military background, we cast him as a policeman,' said Mr Ingram.

But on June 25, a day before Stenberg's truck was found in bushland in the Northern Territory, Mr Ingram received an email turning down the role.

'He wrote back saying it was great to meet you, but unfortunately he had to go up north, and wouldn't be able to take on the role,' Mr Ingram said.

'He had mentioned at his audition that he might have a job to go to up north, but he didn't elaborate.'
