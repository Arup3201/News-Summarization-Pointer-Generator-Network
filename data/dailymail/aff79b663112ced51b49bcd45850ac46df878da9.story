A 27-year-old Austin woman who was charged with causing a fatal DUI accident that killed her friend was sentenced to 10 days in jail after the victim’s parents asked the judge for leniency.

Police said Madeline Rackley, then 25 years old, drove her car into Lady Bird Lake in July 2012 after spending the night drinking with friends in an Austin bar.

Rackley and a female front-seat passenger were able to escape from the sinking car, but 25-year-old Jarrett Ryan Whittington, who was in the backseat, was unable to free himself and drowned.

Justice for Jarrett: Madeline Rackley (left), 27, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for causing the death of Jarrett Ryan Whittington (right), 25, by driving her car into a lake

Light punishment: Rackley will spend 10 days in a county jail, followed by 200 hours of community service and 10 years' probation

The 27-year-old driver was originally charged with intoxication manslaughter, but on Wednesday she appeared in court and tearfully pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

During an emotional hearing, the victim’s father, Gary Whittington, spoke directly to Rackley, saying that he forgave her for causing his son's death.

The father hugged the woman and also handed her a care package containing self-help books on grief, prayers and a letter Mr Whittington had written from the point of view of his dead son.

‘I don't feel qualified to be God here,’ said Gary Whittington. ‘We want the least amount of punishment for the most results,’ according to the station KXAN.

Bereaved: Jarrett's mother and sister wept in the audience as they witnessed Rackley tearfully entering her guilty plea

Jarrett's family requested the lowest possible sentence for Rackley, who will have to serve only 10 days behind bars beginning November 29, followed by 200 hours of community service.

The 27-year-old defendant also will get 10 years’ probation and will be stripped off her driver's license for two years.

Rackley, who was convicted of another DUI in 2010, will have to have an interlock device installed in her car, and she will be subjected to alcohol and drug testing, Statesman.com reported.

If Rackley violates the terms of her plea deal, she could face 20 years in prison.

Lawsuit: The Whittingtons have taken legal action against the Lustre Pearl bar, claiming that a bartender there over-served their son and Rackley on the night of July 1, 2012

Bad move: Rackley ended up driving her Honda off a boat ramp and into Lady Bird Lake

Terrible outcome: Rackley and a female front-seat passenger managed to escape from the car, but Whittington, who was sitting in the back, was unable to free himself and drowned

Tragedy struck just before 2am on July 1, 2012, when Madeline Rickley drove her Honda carrying Jarrett Whittington and another friend off a boat ramp and into Lady Bird Lake.

Officers who arrived on the scene rescued Rackley and the woman from the water, but by the time they learned that there was another person stranded in the sunken car, it was too late.

While the Whittington family had forgiven the young driver, they have filed a lawsuit against the bar Lustre Pearl, claiming that a bartender there over-served Rackley and their son.

Repeat offender: Rackley (left) was convicted of another DWI in 2010

Last month, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission ordered the bar to pay a $40,500 fine, or face a 45-day license suspension.

The agency also imposed restrictions on the types of alcoholic beverages the establishment is allowed to serve.
