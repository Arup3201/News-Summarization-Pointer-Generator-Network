A shooting victim blasted in the face by an unknown gunman walked home and woke up his wife to take him to hospital rather than dialling 911.

The 44-year-old victim was standing at a bus stop on a street corner in Detroit, Michigan, when the gunman approached him and opened fire.

Despite being hit in the face, he was able to walk two city blocks to his house where he got his wife to drive him to nearby St John Hospital, where he was in a critical condition.

Police have said they are 'not sure' whether the man's decision to walk home rather than call for help was prompted by slow 911 response times in the city.

The victim, whose name has not been released, told police he did not know his attacker, who exchanged no words with him before opening fire.

The shooting happened at 4.58am on Monday morning while the victim was waiting at a bus stop on the corner of Morang Drive and Harper Avenue in the city's East Side, said police.

'The victim was standing at the bus stop when an individual walked up and just shot him in the face,' police spokesman Adam Madera told The Detroit News.

'According to the victim, he didn’t know the shooter and no words were exchanged. The victim then walked home and his wife transported him to St John Hospital.'

The victim was on Monday reported as being in a critical condition and there have been no updates on his progress.

Officer Madera told WWJ Newsradio that the motive for the attack was unclear. 'No other crime took place during the incident other than that,' he said.

'He wasn’t assaulted; no pockets were gone through. As of right now it appears he was just shot.'

Asked by WWJ reporter Zahra Huber whether slow 911 response times might have prompted the victim to walk home rather than calling for help, Officer Madera said he 'wasn't sure.'

'I don’t know if anyone had called 911 from the scene or if he just initially took it upon himself to walk home,' he said.

Officer Madera told the Detroit Free Press that investigations were at an early stage. 'Unfortunately, we don’t have a description. There’s not a whole lot that we have to go on right now,' he said.
