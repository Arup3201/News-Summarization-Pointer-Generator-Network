Deep within the woods of New Jersey, a secret homeless community has left the city and taken to the trees to set up home.

But rather than simply eschewing the rat race, the group - many of whom are mentally ill, jobless and battling addiction - claim they have been left with no other choice.

The community in Browns Mills, New Jersey, has been given the eerie title locally as the 'People of the Woods' after being forced to set up camp there - some for as long as 20 years - because Burlington County does not offer homeless shelters.

A reporter for My9nj had to first gain the people's trust before they would take her on a tour of their community among the trees

Reporter Meg Baker, fromÂ My9NJ, was told about the so called tent city by volunteers at the Christian Caring Centre, which provides food and services for the homeless in the woods.

It has been reported that it costs taxpayers around $14,480 per year to care for a single homeless person.

Many of those living in the woods are alcoholics who said they could not afford to pay rent and live on their own and so were 'forced to be there'.

But Christian Caring Centre volunteer Tracy Janusz said it far from a countryside idyll, adding: 'No young person should have to see what is going on there.'

Many of them told her that while they were still able to claim state benefits, they were not enough to afford low income housing, and so they had no other choice but to sleep rough

The centre helps the group with food and occasional day landscaping jobs, but as yet there has been no permanent solution.

The township has taken down most of the tents, although there is no other shelter provided for them.

Another of the caring centre workers said that one of the homeless wood dwellers had become seriously ill after suffering a tick bite. But the cost of his treatment has fallen on the taxpayer to bear.

She added: 'The cost of getting them into a shelter and giving them services would have been so much cheaper and cost effective, and then he could have got c ajo and started paying taxes back into the system.'
