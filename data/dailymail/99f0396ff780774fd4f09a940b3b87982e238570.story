A 20-year-old Baltimore man who punched a six-month pregnant woman in the head four times before robbing her after she fell to her knees has been arrested and charged. 

Michael Williams attacked the unidentified 33-year-old woman from behind as she was walking to work while an accomplice, who remains at large, served as lookout during the incident on January 24.

When she begged Williams to stop, telling him she was pregnant and spilling the contents of her purse out on the street, he replied 'B***h, I don't give a f***!' and said 'don't make me get my Glock!', according to a police report obtained by The Baltimore Sun. 

Baltimore man Michael Williams, 20, was arrested and charged for punching a woman in the head four times before robbing her after she fell to her knees 

Williams took the nurse's iPhone 4, a Bank of America debit card and her keys before fleeing. 

The woman called police from a nearby home and was taken to the Greater Baltimore Medical Center by her husband, where she was treated for her injuries.

She suffered contusions to the torso, face and head and has since been treated and released. The baby remained unharmed, police said.  

When the woman, who was walking to work on the 400 block of Bretton Place (pictured), pleaded with Williams to stop and told him she was pregnant he replied 'B***h, I don't give a f***!' and said 'don't make me get my Glock!'

Williams was arrested after a forensic artist made a detailed sketch that helped the victim identify him, according to WBAL.  

He faces up to eight charges, including assault, robbery, theft and reckless endangerment. 

Williams has had prior arrests for theft and destruction of property, but has never been convicted. 

Officials say he is part of a group well-known for committing crimes in the neighborhood and believe he is connected to other robberies.
