Karl Stefanovic's blue suit is now world famous after the internet went 'a little bit crazy' over the fact the television presenter had been wearing the same thing every day for a year.

The Today show co-host has worn the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry.

Stefanovic said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the past year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked.

Today show co-host Karl Stefanovic has worn the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry

The Channel Nine presenter's year-long suit-wearing investigation came to light on Saturday and Stefanovic was still wearing it on Monday morning when he spoke of the hype surrounding it

The Channel Nine presenter's year-long suit-wearing investigation came to light on Saturday via Fairfax Media and Stefanovic was still wearing it on Monday morning when he spoke of the hype surrounding it. 

'No one has noticed; no one gives a s**t,' he told Fairfax Media.

'Women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them.

'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test).' 

Stefanovic's  experiment has since sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post.

He has worn the suit everyday and just changed his shirt and tie.

'It does get a little bit stinky,' he quipped on the Today show on Monday. 

'It has been dry-cleaned a couple of times and it gets harder and harder to wear.'

The experiment was a show of support for Wilkinson who gave a speech 12 months ago on the pressures and scrutiny women in television faced on a daily basis. 

'Some people have called it reverse sexism, or whatever it is, I don’t know whether it is that because can sexism be women judging mainly other women?' Stefanovic said. 

'I think in this situation for women on TV, it’s mainly women judging women and what they wear.'

Wilkinson said: 'From the emails I've received in this job, most have been from women and I don't know how we got into that space where it leans to a lack of support.'

Stefanovic's sexism stance garnered worldwide attention with feminist website Jezabel among those to weigh in on the experiment.

Reporter Isha Aran wrote: 'As hilarious and interesting as this is, he simply proved something we all already know, the double standard women deal with on a day-to-day basis'.

MTV.com quipped that everyone should pitch in for his dry cleaning bill.

'Stefanovic’s experiment is definitely hilarious but it also shines an important light on what his female colleagues have to deal with every day,' they wrote.

While Stefanovic said he was showing support for his co-host, female television hosts on other networks have also copped similar criticisms on their appearance.

Samantha Armytage, co-host of Channel Seven's Sunrise breakfast program, was ridiculed earlier this year after a newspaper published photos of her in everyday clothes outside of work.

'She's a mate and she was hurt by that... and I can understand. You've got to have a thick skin in TV but there's a limit.,' Stefanovic told Fairfax Media. 

Just last month, ABC News Breakfast host Virginia Trioli made headlines after a viewer told her she needed a makeover and wasn't paying enough attention to her appearance. 

The veteran journalist posted a copy of the letter on social media to highlight the scrutiny she faced.

Social media jumped to support Stefanovic's experiment, labelling it 'magnificent', 'fabulous'

Social media have jumped to support Stefanovic's experiment, labelling it 'magnificent', 'fabulous' and calling him 'a legend' and 'as big as Kim Kardashian's butt'.

Others wondered whether the message would make any impact and commented that women in the media could not avoid being criticised.

'Stefanovic has shown, no matter what a man chooses to wear within a limited scope he will not be examined by the public. Female talk show hosts do not have that option. That's the point I think is being made. Female talk show hosts cannot escape this scrutiny,' said one Twitter user.

Another pointed out that 'Female talk show hosts constantly have their wardrobe choices and bodies examined by the public. This is a consequence of being female. Being female in the workplace means there is no single way of dressing, so there is no escaping the criticism or admiration of the public.'
