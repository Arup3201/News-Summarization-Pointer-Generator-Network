These chocolates might be a delightful surprise for your sweetheart - but a painful one for your bank manager.

Confectionery shop Delice has launched a new box of assorted sweets which will set chocolate-lovers back £600. 

For that princely sum you will be able to savour 240 sweets in a lacquered wooden case inlaid with 24 carat gold or studded with Swarovski crystals.

Customers can pay extra to have their name embossed on the lid in real gold.

Confectionery shop Delice has launched a  box of assorted sweets which will set chocolate-lovers back £600

The Dubai-based sweet company, founded by Jalel Ghayaza, is very particular about the sources of the ingredients for their produce – using exclusively luxury French brand of chocolate Valrhona in its recipes. 

Mr Ghayaza insists on using Tunisian almonds and pistachios from Afghanistan. He says that the best walnuts are from the U.S and that Turkey is the only place from which he will source pine nuts.

Natural colourings derived from beetroot, chlorophyll and turmeric, are used to create the sweets' vibrant decoration and they are flavoured with unsweetened fruit purée: fresh orange, strawberry, apple.

Mr Ghayaza, told The Times that despite the cost of the treats – at £2.50 per chocolate- they have still sold well at the luxury retailer.

'And we have sold a lot of them,' he said.

'Two boxes a day is quite normal. When the children see our counter, they drag their parents across the room to it.'

He added that his mother had been his inspiration in embarking upon a career in the confectionery industry.

'I wanted to make sweets like my mother did,' he said.

'So, five or six times a year, I would wake up in the morning and find five ladies with my mother making sweets.'

He now employs his mother to show the factory workers in the United Arab Emirates how to adorn the sweets with these complicated floral motifs. The process is laborious and limits the factory to producing 3,000kg of sweets a month.

The next dearest confectionery item on sale at Harrods, in Knightsbridge, West London, is the Roberto Cavalli Zebra Praline Chocolate Selection which costs £255.95 for 150 Pieces.

And in 2011, a box of 15 handmade truffles, flecked with gold leaf in a Swarovski crystal-covered box went on sale for an eye-watering £190, or £12.67 per chocolate.

Those wishing to sample Delice's luxury chocolates needn't break the bank as a box of four costs £10.95.
