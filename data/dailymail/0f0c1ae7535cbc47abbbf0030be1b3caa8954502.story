Believe it or not, this rather angry-looking doll is supposed to be Prince George – and it was sold on eBay for over £1,600.

The life-sized ‘replica’ was modelled on photographs of the newborn prince when he left hospital last year.

Known as a ‘reborn’, it is one of hundreds of spooky dolls that have been made and sold around the world.

Spot the difference: The Prince George 'reborn' doll which sold for £1,650 on eBay... and the real baby (right)

Unsettling: The doll - not a toy - came with a King in Training clothes set and an Aden & Anais muslin

It was snapped up on eBay for £1,650, complete with a ‘King in Training’ clothes set and an Aden & Anais muslin which the Prince wore as he left hospital.

The babies are not toys and are made using soft silicone to make them look and feel as lifelike as possible.

Reborn artists have specialist shops around the UK where they craft the dolls to look like real human babies.

Customers are usually adult women who pay up to £2,500 for a popular model.

Australian company Celebrity Dollhouse sold a Prince George replica for £1,020 on eBay.

Lifelike: The fake Prince George, with skin made of silicone... and the real Prince George after leaving hospital

Baby: Prince William with his newborn son after leaving hospital. Hundreds of the dolls have been made

And Reborn artist Helen Beattie, who calls her Merseyside shop a ‘nursery’, and invites would-be ‘mums’ to visit the dolls for ‘cuddles’, has made ‘limited edition’ George dolls for £199 each.

On her website she wrote: 'Visitors are very welcome to call to my nursery and see the Prince for cuddles. Orders can be secured with £60 deposit or a payment in full of just £199.'

She adds: 'Each and every doll I make is special, unique and individual… just like real babies.

'Though every now and then, maybe just once in a lifetime, there comes an opportunity to create something that has a little something extra special and something that can be enjoyed by many for years to come.'

Another artist in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire, uploaded a YouTube video of a woman dressing  a reborn Prince wearing a nappy.

Which do you prefer? The Prince George doll, and his real-life Royal counterpart on the day of his Christening

The 2.45 minute clip is accompanied by some regal music and starts with the caption 'HRH Prince George of Cambridge limited edition portrait baby'.

The video boasts that the doll has 'open mouth, tongue and gums'.

The post by Dream Catcher Reborns has attracted 10,257 views - but one commentator said: 'This is extremely creepy.'

Another added: 'What about the respect for the parents?  Would you like that your baby is created as a "limited" real life doll copy of your child and sold? Sorry that’s so morbid!'
