West Ham have agreed a surprise £3.5million deal for Metz's Senegalese striker Diafra Sakho.

Newcastle and Wigan had also been watching the 24-year-old who helped Metz gain promotion last season before declaring his intent to leave.

Sakho has scored 19 and 20 goals in the last two seasons with Metz in the French second division.

On the move: West Ham have agreed a £3.5million deal with Metz to sign Senegalese striker Diafra Sakho

Sakho was also named the best player in the French Ligue 2 last season.

Agent Willie Mckay said: 'The fee is agreed between the clubs but Diafra is yet to agree personal terms. He is keen to come to England.' 

The move comes as a boost for the Hammers with record signing Andy Carroll out of action for four months following surgery on his ankle.
