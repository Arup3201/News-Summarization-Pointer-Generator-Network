Sunderland have rejected West Ham's £4million bid for Connor Wickham.

As revealed by Sportmail last week, the striker has yet to be offered a new contract by the Black Cats, despite manager Gus Poyet issuing a 'sign or leave' ultimatum to the player.

West Ham and Newcastle were alerted to his situation and the Londoners made a bid on Monday.

On his way out: Wickham is set to the Black Cats after recent rumblings by manager Gus Poyet

Sunderland want to recoup the £8million they paid Ipswich Town three years ago but the Hammers – mindful that Wickham has one year to run on his current deal – have offered half that sum.

The England Under 21 star has never agitated for a move away from the Stadium of Light but has been forced to assess his options in light of his ongoing contract dispute.

Wickham scored the goals which kept Sunderland in the Premier League last season and, with the squad light on attacking options, his departure would be a blow on the eve of the season.

North-East rivals Newcastle are also keen on Wickham but Sunderland would be reluctant to let him join the Magpies in light of Jack Colback's move to Tyneside earlier this summer.
