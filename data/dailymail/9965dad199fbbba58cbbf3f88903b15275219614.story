A schoolboy who was found hanged in his bedroom was being bullied because he suffered from learning difficulties and was dating a younger girl, his family and friends have claimed.

Joshua Maddox, who suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had allegedly suffered months of cruel taunts from classmates because the condition had left him struggling with his schoolwork.

His devastated mother Michelle Maddox, 34, also claimed today that her son was called 'paedo' by classmates because his girlfriend of two months was two years younger than him.

She issued a desperate plea for tougher punishments to be handed to bullies.

The 15-year-old was found hanged by his younger sister Leighlauren at the family home in Walsall, West Midlands, as she went to wake him for school last Thursday morning.

Miss Maddox said: 'I want young people to see what effect bullying can have and educate them better about how to deal with children who have mental health issues.

'I think bullies need a stronger punishment, I feel deep down that nothing will be done about this and I worry it could happen to another family.

'He was my baby, I can't replace him, he's never coming back and I want people to be aware of what bullying can do to people.

'We all went to bed the night before, he never gave any indication or let on that anything was wrong.

'That day he'd been playing with his brothers and they'd been laughing and joking together.

'The only thing we do know is he deleted stuff off his phone just before he died, the police are looking through it for any clues.

'He was very good at putting up a front, you wouldn't be able to find out what was wrong with him.

'Even if you asked he'd say he was fine.'

Heartbroken Miss Maddox said that her son, who died just a month before his 16th birthday, had been dating a younger girl since just before Christmas.

She added: 'We only knew that he had been bullied about his girlfriend because his sister was in the art room when it happened, otherwise we probably never would have known.

'They were calling him a "paedo" because she was two years younger and making fun of the fact that she had glasses.

'We were told about it the week before he left us but he said he wanted to deal with it himself and didn't want me to get involved.

'The problem when children are bullied is that they feel like if they tell on people they'll just get it back ten times worse.'

Scores of Joshua's friends took to social networking sites to play tribute to the 'lovely' and 'cheeky' Year 10 student who was known as Josh, but others hit out at bullies who had targeted him.

Friend Jessica Mary posted on a facebook page set up in his memory: 'R.I.P gorgeous! We was always so close.

'I hope the bullies die inside, I hope they suffer I don't get how they can bully you because you have adhd, its so sick you was lovely lad you was so nice sleep tight lovely x (sic)'

Stepdad Philip Downes, 32, said that Josh behaved as though he was much younger due to his ADHD and autism.

He said: 'I think children need to be more aware of the symptoms of ADHD and other mental health problems.

'Josh showed no physical difference to the other children his age, but in his head it was a different story.

'His body was 15 but his mind was more like a twelve-year-old.

'His body had gone through puberty but his brain hadn't, he just didn't fit in any more with the other children so they picked on him.'

Friends of the youngster who attended St Thomas More Catholic School in Willenhall, West Midlands, described him as a talented artist, footballer and keen video-gamer on the site.

Kirsty Price wrote: 'Josh u was truely amazing and just a total ace person I will never forget u the way u flipped ur hair the way u alway had a smile on ur face we have lost a true angel.

'I will never forget the laugh we have had when we had piggy back race down all the streets.

'U was so amazing at drawing and I will never forget the time I popped ur nose and u still had a smile on ur face rip josh I will never forgett u xxxxxx (sic).'

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman confirmed that Joshua died at the family's Walsall home.

She said: 'We were called to a medical incident, one patient was confirmed dead at the scene.

'No-one was taken to hospital.'

A West Midlands Police spokesman confirmed officers were called to a medical emergency at around 7am last Thursday.

Detective Inspector John Smith said: 'We are completing routine enquiries on behalf of the coroner; the death is not being treated as suspicious.'

Sadness: Joshua was a pupil at St Thomas More Catholic School, in Willenhall, West Midlands. The school asked for privacy following the teenager's death

Joshua's school today said that students were being offered counselling following his death.

A school statement said: 'Our deepest sympathies go to the family and friends of Joshua Maddox who tragically passed away.

'He was a kind and friendly boy well-liked by friends and teachers.

'School counselling staff have been made available to support staff and pupils over the coming days and weeks as they come to terms with this sudden and extremely sad news.

'Walsall Council and Walsall Children's Services - Serco have also offered their sympathy to Joshua's family, friends and to our school. They are in regular contact with us and we will continue to work together to support the family and school community.

'It would be appreciated if the family's and school's privacy could be respected at this difficult time.'
