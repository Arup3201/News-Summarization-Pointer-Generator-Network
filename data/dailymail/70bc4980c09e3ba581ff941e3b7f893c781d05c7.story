A 75-year-old Detroit-area woman convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of her teen grandson was sentenced to at least 22 years in prison Thursday, despite her desperate plea to a judge to spare her from dying behind bars.

Sandra Layne got a minimum sentence of 20 years for second-degree murder, along with a mandatory two-year sentence for using a gun to kill 17-year-old Jonathan Hoffman.

Hoffman was shot six times, including twice in the back, last spring in Oakland County's West Bloomfield Township. Layne said she shot him out of fear during a physical altercation, but a jury in March rejected her claim of self-defense.

Prosecutors said there were no signs of Layne being injured by Hoffman. A recording of a 911 call shows him being shot again while pleading for help - a critical piece of evidence that jurors played over and over during deliberations.

Judge Denise Langford Morris zeroed in on it, too, wondering why Layne simply didn't call police if she felt helpless.

'Grandmothers are supposed to protect. ... Why did you keep shooting and how could you keep shooting?' Morris asked.

'You didn't have to keep shooting. Those were hollow-pointed bullets designed for a devastating impact.'

Layne sobbed heavily during a long, rambling address to the judge, her belly chains and handcuffs sagging over orange jail clothes on her slight frame.

'I'm sorry for what I did. I apologize 
to everyone I've hurt, everyone. ... Sorry is too small a word,' she 
said, pleading with Morris to not allow her to die in prison.

Layne's daughter, Jennifer Hoffman, urged the judge to show no mercy.

'She showed no mercy when she planned, stalked and murdered my son in 
his bedroom. Sandra Layne is pure evil and if given the opportunity 
would surely kill again,' Jennifer Hoffman said.

Hoffman's father did not attend the 
hearing because he was in Arizona with his 16-year-old daughter, 
Jessica, who is recovering from a tumor.

Michael Hoffman said the girl 
'has a hole in her heart to match the hole in her head' since her 
brother's death.

In a letter read by the prosecutor, 
the father said Layne 'put on her war paint and came in gunning for my 
boy.'

He accused Layne of killing his son because he was ready to move 
on after high school and she would no longer be able to control him.

Hoffman was living with his grandmother during his last year of high school while his parents lived in Arizona where a daughter was being treated for a brain tumor.

He had a history of drug use and had tested positive for synthetic marijuana on the day of the shooting. Layne claimed he feared flunking probation and demanded money and a car to leave the area.

Prosecutors, however, said Hoffman was wearing just shorts and socks when he was killed and had made plans to see a friend that night, not flee.

Prosecutor Paul Walton, noting the minutes that went by before Layne shot the boy again, said he had never handled a homicide 'this cold, this long and this calculating.'

Layne blamed the parents for not taking Jonathan back to Arizona and said her grandson's drug use made him unmanageable for an elderly woman.

She accused Michael Hoffman of giving up on the boy and said she pleaded with the pair to return to Michigan when drugs landed him in the hospital.

'If I could go back, I never would have bought that gun,' Layne told the judge. 'I would have said to his parents it's their responsibility, help him, take him.'

Outside court, Jennifer Hoffman said her mother was lying about any indifference by parents. She said she visited Michigan once a month.

'She's a complete narcissist. ... I wish I had seen how evil she was. I wouldn't have left my son with her,' Jennifer Hoffman told reporters.

Layne's husband, Fred, and son, Scott Silvers, declined to comment on the sentence. The judge said Hoffman probably belonged in a rehab center or another place outside his grandmother's supervision but instead 'is in his grave at 17.'

'Make no mistake,' Morris said, 'Jonathan is the victim here.'

Jennifer Hoffman smiled as she left court in March after the 75-year-old was convicted of second-degree murder. Hoffman described her mother Sandra Layne as a 'monster' outside the Michigan courtroom where she had been found guilty of killing 17-year-old Jonathan.

Layne shot her grandson six times during an argument last spring as he pleaded with 911 responders to help him on the phone at the West Bloomfield Township home.

Following the verdict, Ms Hoffman told the Detroit Free Press that she was happy that her mother had been found guilty.

She added: 'I know my son is in heaven and that is a place she’ll never see.'

Hoffman had been living with his grandparents since 2011 when his parents divorced and moved to Arizona.

The elderly woman's husband Fred Layne wept in court as his wife was shackled and taken away by officers.

Layne struck grandson Jonathan Hoffman with six of
ten shots fired over a six-minute span on May 18, 2012.

During the two-week trial, the jury heard a recording of 
the 17-year-old's desperate call to 911 and even more shots while he was
on the line.

'My grandma shot me. I'm going to die. Help. I got shot again,' Hoffman told a dispatcher as he gasped for air.

Prosecutor Paul Walton told jurors that Layne never rushed out of the West Bloomfield Township home, despite claiming to be afraid of her grandson, and never called for an ambulance to help him.

She claimed that she shot him after Hoffman struck her during a heated argument about money and a plan to flee Michigan because of a failed drug test.

'She told the court last week: 'I wanted him to pay attention to me. 
He had to listen.

''It wasn't a conversation. It was arguing. Swearing.'

But Walton pointed 
out that Layne never complained to police about being attacked.

A 
hospital nurse who examined her after her arrest said Layne had no 
injuries and spoke lovingly about Hoffman.

Defense attorney Jerome Sabbota asked jurors to view the incident through the eyes of a woman in her 70s.

He said Layne was taking care of a teen 
who had used drugs and brought strangers to the home. Hoffman's parents 
were in Arizona during his senior year of high school.

''Her adrenalin is pumping. You're not calm,' Sabbota said in his closing remarks. 'Boom, boom, boom - you pull the trigger.'

During her emotional testimony last week, Sandra Layne said that it was a difficult arrangement, especially after her grandson was treated in a hospital for using hallucinogenic drugs.

Layne said Hoffman was deeply upset on the day of the shooting after testing positive for so-called synthetic marijuana. She said she had to stop the car three times on the way home to calm him down.

'He's got to sit down. We've got to make a plan,' Layne told the jury. 'He's got to talk to people, his mother, his father.

'We're screaming at each other. He said, ''I'm getting out of here. They're going to put me in jail.'' ... He had to stay here. We had to resolve things here.'

Layne said she shot the teen during another argument later at her home. She acknowledged in her testimony that she told police that she had 'murdered' Hoffman.

'I recall saying a few things. I'm screaming, hysterical,' Layne told the jurors.
