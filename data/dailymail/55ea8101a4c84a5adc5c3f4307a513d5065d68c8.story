Quizzed: Constance Briscoe said she was asked about whether Vicky Pryce broke off her engagement to the disgraced cabinet minister when he allegedly confessed to same-sex relationships

A judge accused of lying to police was quizzed by a reporter over claims that Chris Huhne had ‘liaisons with men’, a court heard yesterday.

Constance Briscoe said she was asked about whether Vicky Pryce broke off her engagement to the disgraced Cabinet minister when he allegedly confessed to same-sex relationships.

The barrister is on trial accused of trying to pervert the course of justice in connection with the investigation into Huhne’s speeding points scandal.

She told police after she was arrested that the Mail on Sunday’s David Dillon had also asked her about claims that Huhne had infected Pryce with lice.

But Briscoe denied ever speaking to the journalist about Huhne passing speeding points to his now ex-wife, the court heard. Briscoe, 56, denies three counts of intending to pervert the course of justice.

Southwark Crown Court in London has been told she allegedly lied in two witness statements and then later altered a statement to hide her dishonesty.

She is also accused of deliberately showing an expert the wrong copy of the altered statement so that his report would say the alteration was a printing error.

Jurors have heard that Briscoe denied speaking to journalists about the speeding points in her statement, but emails later emerged showing she had been communicating with the Mail on Sunday.

Following her arrest in October 2012, she told officers she had spoken to Mr Dillon, but not about the motoring offence.

In a video-recorded interview under caution, she said: ‘Dillon had contacted me, and he had certainly contacted Vicky, there was an occasion where they were looking at various stories about Chris Huhne.

‘They were looking at the speeding story and that I couldn’t assist them on but there were other stories as well that the papers, in particular Mr Dillon, were interested in.

‘He had discovered somehow that Vicky Pryce had called off her  engagement, or whatever it was, to Chris and it had been called off ... because Chris had said to Vicky he had had liaisons, whatever you want to call it, with men. I knew nothing about this.

‘The other contact he was pursuing – and I’m not quite sure whether I should say this but I am going to, I am going to say it because I’m not having any of this bloody nonsense about me perjuring myself.

‘When Chris was a European MEP he had come home and he had infected Vicky with crabs. And the explanation he had given when Vicky had crabs was that he had contracted the crabs from the clean sheets in whatever hotel he was in.’

Briscoe told officers that, again, she knew nothing about the story.

The judge, who has been suspended since her arrest, was originally due to be a prosecution witness in the case against Pryce and Huhne.

But jurors have heard that once it was discovered she had apparently lied about her contact with journalists, it was decided she was not a reliable witness.

The court was also told she helped Pryce, who was her London neighbour, to reveal information about the points-swapping to newspapers after she and Huhne separated in 2010.

The scandal led to the Lib Dem politician’s resignation and subsequent prosecution. He pleaded guilty in February last year, while Pryce, an economist, was convicted after a trial. Both were released early from eight-month prison sentences.

Briscoe told police Pryce confided in her in 2003 about the speeding points. But she was arrested after emails showed she had been in contact with journalists – something she had denied. The trial continues.
