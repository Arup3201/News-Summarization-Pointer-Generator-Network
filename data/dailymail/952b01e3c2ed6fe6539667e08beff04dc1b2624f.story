Heartless: Christine Stevens posed as a counsellor to take money from a grief-stricken mother who had suffered two miscarriages

A conwoman posing as a counsellor took money from a vulnerable mother who was grieving over two miscarriages.

Cold-hearted Christine Stevens, 47, advertised herself on Facebook and duped vulnerable Lisa Williams, 39, into paying £185 for nine counselling sessions.

A court heard she claimed to be head of a council's therapeutic services and even used the authority's logo on emails and invoices.

She also put the initials of the 
British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) on her 
correspondence to imply she was an accredited member of the body.

Stevens preyed on Mrs Williams after she lost two babies in the space of a few months last year.

Her
callous deception was uncovered when her victim contacted Cheshire East
Council to complain about the advice she was getting and Stevens was 
charged with fraud.

Anne Roues, prosecuting at South 
Cheshire Magistrates Court, said: 'The victim had been feeling extremely
down and decided to seek counselling.

'This was a lady going for help and believing she would pay for a service and would receive one. She gave out confidential information which has caused her substantial anxiety.'

Mrs Roues added: 'The defendant said she didn't have an office land line and the complainant became suspicious.'

Mrs Williams, a credit controller, met with
Stevens for a few sessions before asking for her office number and the name of her manager
to make a complaint.

Yesterday South Cheshire Magistrates Court was told that Stevens decided to end the sessions and, during that time, Mrs Williams had asked for contact details for her manager at Cheshire East Council – the authority Stevens claimed she worked for.

Mrs Williams said she had been unhappy over the way the counselling was going and wanted to make a complaint to the authority. But it was not until she underwent further treatment with another counsellor that she found the confidence to follow up her complaint with the authority.

Sentence: Stevens was ordered to repay the cash and carry out 120 hours of unpaid work at South Cheshire Magistrates' Court (pictured)

After the council confirmed Stevens 
was not an employee, Mrs Williams -  who lost her first baby last 
January at six weeks and her second child at 12 weeks in May last year -
got in contact with the police who later made an arrest.

She said: 'I had undergone some 
hypnotherapy. People think it is all about having a clock waved infront 
of you but it is nothing like that.

'It is about unlocking your 
subconscious. After a hypnotherapy session I went straight to the council and gave them her details to find out if she worked for them.'

Police: Stevens, of Congleton, Cheshire told police she was unemployed but classed herself as a private counsellor

Stevens, of Congleton, Cheshire told police she was unemployed but classed herself as a private counsellor.

She admitted having no links to the council or being a member of the BACP and pleaded guilty to fraud by misrepresentation.

Stuart Flood, defending, said Stevens had qualified as a counsellor in July.

He said: 'She is adamant that when she spoke to Lisa she said she was a
private counsellor but certain e-mails were sent that would give her 
the impression she was working for the council.

'Lisa was her first client. I don't think my client set out to deceive anyone.'

Stevens was ordered to repay the money and carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.

She was also made the subject of a 12-month supervision order and told to pay £85 costs plus a £65 victim surcharge.

After
the case Mrs Williams, of Alsager, Cheshire, said: 'It has affected me 
deeply and caused me major anguish, distress and upset. It has made me aware there are people out there who will do things like this.'
