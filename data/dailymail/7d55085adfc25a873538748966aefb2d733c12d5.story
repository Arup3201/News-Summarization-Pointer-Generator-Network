British folklore says that if it rains on St Swithun's Day then it will continue to do so for another 40 days, but if it is fair it will also remain so for that period.

So superstitious Britons have been encouraged to get their brollies out, as wet weather is forecast for the saint's feast day tomorrow in the South-East.

But forecasters say there is no need to worry about the folklore coming true as the country will be hotter than Barbados towards the end of this week with humid temperatures of up to 30C (86F).

A mostly-fine week is forecast, and 
Thursday - set to be the hottest day of 2014 - will see Britain be up to
 four degrees hotter than the Caribbean island.

While
 there is set to be some rain, most parts of the UK will remain dry over
 the next few days and temperatures will be generally warm.

Met Office forecaster Mark Seltzer said: ‘There will be some localised rain in a few locations on Tuesday.

‘There's
 likely to be some drizzle in the South-East and later on into Wednesday
 there will be some rain in Northern Ireland and western Wales.

‘On Wednesday it will be mostly dry but in England and Wales there could be some isolated heavy showers in the afternoon.’

Temperatures in London today will reach highs of 25C (77F), with the warm weather contributing to thunderstorms at the weekend.

The
 current record temperature for the year was set earlier this month on 
July 4, with 28.7C (84F) recorded in Writtle, Essex, and Weybourne, 
Norfolk.

A
 severe weather warning for rain was in place yesterday, covering the 
east coast from Hartlepool, County Durham, down to Folkestone, Kent.

The
 Environment Agency had five flood alerts in place today – including for
 the River Wid and Can in Essex, and the River Avon near Bristol.

Also
 covered were Porlock Weir in Somerset, the River Bure and Spixworth 
Beck in Norfolk and the River Thames from Putney to Teddington in 
London.

While it is unlikely that any one location will see rain fall every day for the next 40, there is some element of truth to weather patterns continuing.

By this point in the summer, the jet stream is usually set in a pattern which tends to last until the end of August.

The jet stream is a fast-flowing current of air located around four to seven miles up in the atmosphere.

It tends to steer the areas of high and low pressure around the globe and marks a boundary between cold air to the north and warmer air to the south.

If it is sitting to the north of the UK, then warm air tends to invade from the south, usually associated with high pressure building in from the Azores, leading to fine and settled weather for the British Isles.

However, should the jet stream sit across the UK or to the south, then cooler air from the north is dragged down and low pressure systems move across the country from the Atlantic, leading to unsettled weather.

So far, the jet stream is pointing directly towards the British Isles, indicating unsettled weather.
