Comedian and prankster Howie Mandel became the butt of a joke when his house was TP'd with more than 4,000 rolls of toilet paper. 

Fellow prankster Roman Atwood brought the toilet paper and friends to Mandel's Californian mansion as the former Deal or No Deal host was flying home from New York. 

They unloaded the truck full of materials and Atwood and friends - along with Mandel's son - covered the house end to end.

'My dad just landed and I sent my mom to stall him at the airport,' Mandel's son Alex Mandel told Atwood.

Thirty minutes later, Mandel, who pranked people in his TV show Howie Do It, pulled up to the house, shocked to see it covered in toilet paper.

'Oh my God! How do you get into a gated community? Are you f******* kidding me? What is this?' he said as he walked up to the house. 

Atwood and his friends had enough toilet paper to fill an entire U-Haul truck. They unpacked it all and lined the house before throwing it on to the roof

With toilet paper ready and lined up with the house, Atwood, friends and Mandel's family took turns throwing rolls

When Mandel (pictured) arrived home, however, he did not seem pleased with the mess. At first he was shocked anyone could get into his gated community

Atwood even wrote a special message with the toilet paper - 'Smile More' - and Mandel eventually found humor in the prank. 

At the end of the video Mandel can be seen picking up paper from around the driveway, and Atwood jokes that he has to leave.

'It's so weird. I was going to run out to get toilet paper. Give me a key to the door, I have to go to the bathroom. I really have to go, it's not a joke. I'll take some with me, it's crazy!' Mandel said in a behind-the-scenes video. 

But by the end of the prank when Atwood reveals himself, Mandel laughed and embraced the toilet paper mess
