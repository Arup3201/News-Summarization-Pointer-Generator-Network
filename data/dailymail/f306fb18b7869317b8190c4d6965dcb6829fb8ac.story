A woman survived an incredible plunge from a clifftop in a car, and then had to watch her husband slowly die before her eyes before rescuers reached them.

Xiu Lo, 39, watched husband Feng, 43, die next to her as she sat trapped in their car for five days after it fell off the cliff in a remote road in China. 

'It was terrible. I had to sit and watch him die knowing that I could do nothing to save him,' said the distraught woman.

She survived by sipping mineral water and eating a bunch of grapes that the couple had with them.

The accident happened on the Bizi Mountain near Baoding City in Shandong Province. 

On May 12, the couple were on an afternoon outing when the husband who was driving suddenly lost control of the vehicle and it fell from the cliff edge in to a ravine below.

'We smashed on to rocks,' said Xiu Lo.

'My husband was badly injured. He was in and out of conscious and died after about three days later.'

She said at night, she was terrified and feared that snakes or rats or other wild animals would be attracted to the wreck by the blood.

'When the dawn came up each morning I prayed that I would be rescued,' Xiu Lo said.

'Where we had crashed was very remote and I knew that my chances of discovery were not good. But I kept myself alive with the grapes and the water.

Sad: 'It was terrible. I had to sit and watch him die knowing that I could do nothing to save him,' Xiu Lo said after her rescue

'My husband knew he was going to die, but he told me to stay strong, he told me I had to survive. It gave me the strength not to give up.'

After five days a group of trail walkers spotted the wreck, called the authorities and she was rescued.

She was airlifted to hospital where she is recovering.

A police spokesman said: 'She was too injured to climb the cliff face. She is a very lucky woman.'
