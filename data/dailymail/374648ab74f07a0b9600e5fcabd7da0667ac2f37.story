Scientists have invented a 'suicidal' satellite, attached to a giant sail, that can destroy dangerous space junk.

The CubeSail, developed by the University of Surrey, carries the satellite into orbit where it then attaches itself to floating debris.

Once a satellite has fixed onto its target, the large solar sails deploy and slows the speeding debris down enough so it falls out of orbit.

This is an artist's impression of what the CubeSail is expected to look like when it's launched. The mini satellite can be seen in the centre of the deployed sail

The mini satellites, weighing only 6lbs, are placed inside the giant sail. While in space, the satellites attach themselves to debris. The sail then opens, slows the debris down so it falls to Earth, and is destroyed by the atmosphere

Another plan to clear space junk was announced in April by British space company Astrium UK.

Astrium's plans would see a 'chase' satellite fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target.

Using laser and radar guidance systems, a piece of space junk would be targeted, and then captured with a gas-propelled harpoon on a tether.

Once the space junk is secured, a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.

Then the chase satellite would then search out another target.

The debris then burns up in the Earth's atmosphere - along with the 6lb satellite.

There is said to be around 5,500 tonnes of floating debris currently orbiting the planet, travelling at five miles per second.

Scientists at the University of Surrey have been working on the project, funded by the European space company Astrium, for the last three years.

It is hoped the first satellite, called Space Sails, could be launched by the end of the year.

Professor Vaios Lappas, lecturer in altitude and orbit control systems at the university, believes the Space Sail satellite offers a cheap way of getting rid of space junk.

It is an alternative to the more expensive method of shooting debris down with lasers.

He said:Â  'There is a lot of debris in space and there is a need to declutter it.

'We have had two collisions in the last three years. When that happens it just creates even more debris.

As the sails deploy, they twist from around the satellite in the centre. Once deployed the sail slows debris down until it can no longer orbit and falls to Earth. It is then burnt off in the Earth's atmosphere

This image shows the size of the CubeSail when it's fully open. The sail is five metres long and five metres wide

The mechanism for deploying the sail being tested at the University of Surrey

'We are working on ways we can get the Space Sails to stick onto the debris.

'There has already been techniques published on capturing space debris, like using nets or harpoons and those are two techniques we could use.

'Other people have been thinking about using robotic arms, but that could be expensive.

'Once the sails are on the piece of debris, it will decelerate quickly, burn up in the Earth's atmosphere and evaporate.'

All the space junk around the planet is the result of 50 years of abandoning spacecraft.

Collisions with space debris can destroy expensive technology.

Such a collision could also see potentially large pieces of debris coming back down to Earth.

The build-up of debris - which is expected to grow at a rate of five per cent each year - is also believed to obstruct satellite television and other communications signals.

Work on the Space Sail project has been completed but needs extra funding before it can be launched into space.

Prof Lappas said 'Protecting our planet and environment is key for sustainable growth.

'This is a novel, low cost space mission and can offer a low cost/mass solution to the problem.

'It can be used for future satellites and launches and dramatically reduce the problem of space debris.'

Danger: With the debris in low-Earth orbit spinning around the planet at speeds of about 17,500mph, even tiny pieces can cause serious damage to satellites and pose a deadly hazard to astronauts
