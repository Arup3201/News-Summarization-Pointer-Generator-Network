Most footballers often find themselves on the wrong end of abuse from fans for poor performances and it would seem the Arsenal players have had enough as they attempted to prove their critics wrong with a promotional video for Paddy Power.  

Firstly, Per Mertsesacker sets out to prove his pace after one football fan claimed his milk would turn quicker than the big German.

The defender put in a quick sprint as the referee test the milk before giving him the thumbs up.

Challenge: Per Mertesacker put his pace to the test for the lighthearted advert

Pace: Mertesacker seemed determined to prove that he could turn quicker than a pint of milk

Milking it: The referee gave the Arsenal defender the thumbs up after trying the milk

Fellow German Lukas Podolski was then tasked with hitting a barn door after a fan suggested the forward wouldn't be able to do it.

It may have taken Podolski a few more attmepts than he had hoped, but he eventually smacked the centre of the door with a left-footed strike.

Finally, Mikel Areta was introduced to an elderly woman who one fan believed would take a better penalty than the Spaniard.

Needless to say, there was little compeition as Arteta swept his spot-kick home before putting his arm around the woman's shoulder and walking away. 

Miss: Lukas Podolski wasn't happy with a fan claiming he couldn't hit a barn door with a football

Finish: It took the German several efforts to actually hit the barn door with a left-footed strike

Joke: Mikel Arteta was out to prove that he could take a better penalty than someone's grandmother

Good fun: Arteta walks away with the elderly woman after the friendly penalty shootout
