A baffled couple have been ordered by the council to pull down their garage, driveway and wall - 30 years after planning permission was given.

When Janet and Barry Ashdown bought their home in Holderness, East Yorkshire in 1986 one of the main attractions was the large extended double garage, which had been recently been built.

But now East Riding Council claims the extension – built with a previous council's planning permission – is encroaching on a public footpath, even though there is a 4ft wide tarmac strip running past their house.

The problem became apparent when the retired couple, who are looking to rebuild their garage, noticed that the previous owners hadn't registered the extension with  Land Registry and decided to apply for 'possessory title' or squatters’ rights.

Their research revealed that planning permission had been given for a change of use for the land from an amenity area to a private garden in 1983, and plans for a garage extension and driveway were granted the following year.

The Ashdowns even have a letter from the former Holderness Borough Council in 1985, confirming that a boundary wall put up the following year conformed to official specifications.

Mrs Ashdown, a retired milliner, said: 'There's never been an objection in 30 years and we can’t see what they will achieve apart from a bit of extra grass they will have to maintain.

'I don’t know why they want to make an issue of this other than that they can and they have the financial backing to do it. But it will cost us thousands of pounds – savings we hoped to put to better use in our retirement.'

On April Fool's Day 1996, the new unitary East Riding of Yorkshire was established. The Ashdowns live in Holderness in the East Riding

Villager Harry Buck, 85, who has been a councillor for 40 years, said: 'In my mind this is total silliness, stupidity and lack of common sense on the part of the East Riding.

'The original land the footpath was on is untouched and nothing is encroaching on the path that's there now.'

On April 1, 1996, Humberside and the borough were abolished, and it became part of the new East Riding of Yorkshire council.
