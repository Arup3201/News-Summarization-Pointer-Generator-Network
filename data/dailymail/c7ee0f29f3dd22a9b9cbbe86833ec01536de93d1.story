Ten British tourists say they are lucky to be alive after their minibus flipped on to its roof on a busy motorway in Croatia when the driver allegedly fell asleep at the wheel.

The friends, all aged 19 and 20, were on their way to Zagreb airport to fly home to Manchester on Friday when their minibus hit a barrier at the side of the road - and overturned before skidding along the A1 motorway on its roof.

All 10 of the group were rushed to hospital - many with serious injuries including broken bones in their backs.

Six are still being treated at the hospital and their relatives have flown out to be 
at their bedsides.

Lucky to be alive: Ten British tourists were being driven to Zagreb Airport in this minibus when the driver allegedly fell asleep before crashing into a roadside barrier in Ogulin, Croatia

Seven of the female passengers who were hurt in the minibus crash, from left to right are Sophie Gallimore, Colette Alderson, Cesca Tillyard (crouching), Vicky Morris, Imogen Farrell, Rosie Smith and Anna Tratalos

Many of the group of seven women and three men were former schoolmates from Loreto Grammar School for Girls in Altrincham.

Anna Tratalos, 19, of Elm Road, Hale, and her boyfriend Aron Cheema, 20, from Gatley, were able to fly home after escaping with cuts and bruises - but say they are lucky to be alive.

Miss Tratalos said: 'When I look back at it now, I can't believe none of us died.

'It's been a terrible experience, I've not been sleeping well and have been having nightmares but when you look at our injuries we've been the lucky ones.'

The friends say they were sent an eight-seater minibus with only two seatbelts after ordering a taxi for 10 people - but were forced to take the transfer in order to catch their flight home to Manchester.

After boarding the bus many of the group became concerned about the driver who they claim stopped twice in two hours for coffee and appeared to be playing loud music to prevent himself from nodding off.

Mr Cheema said: 'Some of us were saying: "I think this guy's going to fall asleep" but you don't believe it's actually going to happen.

'We were asleep at the moment of impact but a couple of us that were awake said at the last second they noticed he seemed to have his eyes closed.

Safety concerns: The British tourists claim they ordered a taxi for ten people but were forced to get in the eight-seater minibus with just two seatbelts, pictured after the crash, or they would have missed their flight

Injured: Dom Visser, 19, pictured left, was left with a fractured back in two places after the crash while Aron Cheema, 20, pictured right suffered just cuts and bruises

'I don't remember much about the crash but we noticed some flames and we all managed to help each other out of the windows and away from the bus pretty quickly.'

Miss Tratalos added: 'We just want everyone back home and back together now, then we can start to put it behind us.'

Of the six still left in Croatia - four are suffering from broken bones in their backs, one from a broken sternum and ribcage, and one from a broken ankle.

One of the injured passengers Colette Alderson, 20, from Vicarage Lane, Bowdon, is in a wheelchair with back injuries. She also needed stitches to a head injury.

Collette's mother Catherine, 49, flew out over the weekend to be with her daughter.

Her father Martin Alderson, also 49, said: 'We're hoping she'll be back in the next week and the Foreign Office are currently helping us with the arrangements to bring her home.

'She's bearing up very well but I think it's shaken them all up a bit and she just wants to get home now. Thankfully they're all ok because it sounds like it was a serious accident.'

The other injured friends include Dominic Visser, 19, who has a fractured back in two places and glass in his eye and will be in a back brace for 12 weeks.

Imogen Farell, 20, who has a broken sternum and broken ribs, Rosie Smith, 20, who has a fractured back in two places and Sophie Gallimore, 20, who has a fractured back, broken ankle and cuts to her face.

The others are Cesca Tillyard, 20, who broke her ankle, Max Davies, 20, who suffered a deep cut to his foot and bruises and Vicky Morris, 20, who had minor cuts and bruises.

Five emergency teams raced to the scene of the crash on Croatia's A1 motorway between Karlovac and Ogulin. The driver of the minibus was also injured but his injuries are not understood to be life-threatening.
