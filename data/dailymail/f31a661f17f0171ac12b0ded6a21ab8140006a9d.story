An ‘astonishing’ drug that has apparently cured a man dying of skin cancer was hailed by doctors yesterday.

They say the results of medical trials are ‘jaw-dropping’ and offer hope for victims of other forms of cancer.

The medicine, pembrolizumab, is the latest in a new generation of ‘immunotherapy’ treatments that prevent cancers from shielding themselves from the immune system. Instead it lets the immune system attack the disease, often in conjunction with other conventional drugs.

The drug was tested on melanoma because the prospects for patients with advanced forms of the disease are so grim –  only 10 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women survive a year.

But in the trial involving 411 patients, 69 per cent were still alive 12 months after starting on immunotherapy.

The ‘cured’ patient, 64-year-old Warwick Steele from Ruislip, west London, has had six months of treatment with the drug, which is injected into the bloodstream.

After three months his tumours had almost vanished and they show no sign of returning.

His consultant, David Chao of the Royal Free in London, said: ‘We cannot say for certain that he’s been cured, but he is doing very well.

‘He was aware that without an effective treatment his survival prospects were not good – maybe months. Pembrolizumab looks like it has potential to be a paradigm shift for cancer therapy and is firmly helping to establish immunotherapy as one of the most exciting and promising treatment modalities in recent years.

‘This is one of several new drugs of this type being produced. What these early trials are showing is that they are fulfilling their promise ridiculously fast.

‘Some of these results are really astonishing; almost jaw-dropping. And these drugs may be applicable to many different cancer types, including ones that are hard to treat such as lung cancer.

‘Cancers adapt to treatments, and when they come back they are harder to treat. Can we dream about actually curing some of our patients with very advanced cancer?

‘Once we get the immune system attacking the cancer, can it act independently to keep the cancer under control?

‘We don’t have all the answers yet, but that’s what we’re looking at.’

Pembrolizumab is a man-made antibody that blocks a biological pathway – programmed cell death 1 or PD-1 – that cancers use to shield themselves from the immune  system. In healthy individuals,  PD-1 is part of the process that applies a ‘brake’ to the immune system. By removing the brake, the immune system is freed to do the job of defeating the cancer.

Pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated by the trial patients, said Dr Chao, although responses varied widely. Results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.

Clinicians do not yet know exactly how pembrolizumab might affect survival chances.

After 18 months, 62 per cent of patients were still alive and undergoing treatment.

Around 80 per cent of patients responded to the drug in some way – an unusually high proportion.

Seventy-two per cent experienced tumour shrinkage, including 39 per cent whose tumours were more than halved in size.

Additional data showed the drug also reduced the size of advanced non-small cell lung cancers by up to 47 per cent. It is being tested on 30 forms of the disease, including cancers of the head and neck.

Pembrolizumab’s American manufacturer, Merck Sharp & Dohme, is expected to apply for a European licence to market the drug within months. It is being fast-tracked in the US. The price is not known.

Each year, around 13,300 people in the UK are diagnosed with melanoma – more than a third of them under 55.

Gillian Nuttall, founder of the charity Melanoma UK, said: ‘Advanced melanoma is a terrible disease with a poor prognosis.

‘Pembrolizumab represents the latest advance in a whole raft of new treatments in advanced melanoma which have come through over the past few years.

‘These results are really exciting and could represent a turning point for patients affected by advanced melanoma giving them a greater chance of survival.’
