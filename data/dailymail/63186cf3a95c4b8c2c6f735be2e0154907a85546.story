Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will do everything in its power to ensure the bodies of the Australians killed on Flight MH17 are respected.

'We owe it to the dead, all the dead, we owe it to the families, all the families to do everything in our power to respect the bodies, to find the truth and to ensure justice is done,' Mr Abbott told 60 Minutes on Sunday night.

The Prime Minister attended a national security committee of cabinet meeting on Sunday evening after images emerged of the crash site in eastern Ukraine being 'absolutely trampled'.

He told 60 Minutes the discussion at the meeting was dominated by concerns to ensure the bodies were treated with respect and taken to a place where a proper investigation could be carried out.

Mr Abbott has warned that MH17 victims' bodies will not be intact

The Prime Minister says it could be weeks before victims' remains are brought back to their families in AustraliaÂ 

'We are consulting with our friends, we are consulting with our allies because frankly it is simply unacceptable to see what is happening on this site given that 298 innocent people have been murdered,' Mr Abbott told the program.

He also said Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was in New York prosecuting Australia's case before the Security Council for an immediate securing of the site, proper treatment of the bodies and a full and fair investigation.

Earlier on Sunday, an emotional Tony Abbott held himself together as he spoke of the innocent lives lost in the downed Malaysian Airline MH17 in eastern Ukraine.

The Australian Prime Minister revealed that his daughters had boarded an MH17 flight when they flew back from Europe a few months earlier as he warned that it could be weeks before the remains of MH17 victims are returned to their families in Australia.

'The grim truth is that not all the bodies will be intact,' he told ABC program Insiders on Sunday morning.

The service was dedicated to the 298 lives lost during the tragic MH17 crash in eastern Ukraine

Mr Abbott described the crash site in eastern Ukraine as 'chaotic'

These were 'wrenching times' but he couldn't allow emotions to cloud his judgment.

'You look at the faces of the dead and they're your neighbours, they're your friends, they could be your kids because let's face it, we're a people who like to travel,' Mr Abbott said.

'And my own daughters flew on MH17 some months ago on their way home from Europe, so this is a tragedy that touches us deeply.

'There are 36 people who call Australia home who have been snuffed out. This is an horrific crime.'

Mr Abbott described the crash site in eastern Ukraine as 'chaotic' and reports of pro-Russian rebels meddling with the evidence - including the removal of bodies - as 'outrageous'.

He also expressed concerns about the security at the crash site in eastern Ukraine.

This comes after Russia agreed to an international investigation into MH17 amid mounting scepticism about its willingness to co-operate with the international community.

'My fear is that Russia will say the right thing, but that on the ground interference with the site, interference with investigators, interference with the dignified treatment of bodies will continue,' he said.

At least two attempts by international investigators to access the site had been frustrated by rebels, Mr Abbott said.

'The site is chaotic, it's absolutely chaotic,' he said.

'The kinds of things that would normally be happening at an air crash site are not happening.'

However Mr Abbott would not say if he had tried to make contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin, nor if Australia would block his attendance at November's G20 meeting in Brisbane.

'It's not too late for changes of heart,' he said.

'There are excuses. There is blame shifting. There is handwashing going on, and that's not acceptable, it's simply not acceptable.'

Russian Minister for Economic Development Alexei Ulyukayev, in Sydney for a G20 summit, was summoned for an unexpected meeting with Mr Abbott on Saturday.

The prime minister made clear his 'dissatisfaction with the way this has been handled'.

'Russian controlled territory, Russian-backed rebels, quite likely a Russian supplied weapon - Russia can't wash its hands of this,' he said.

He said the international community had a 'very high degree of confidence' MH17 was brought down by a missile launched by Russian backed rebels.

There was 'slightly less confidence' that the weapon was Russian supplied, he said.

'There is very, very strong evidence that sophisticated weaponry has moved across the border from Russia into Ukraine, sometimes its moving backwards and forwards across the border from Russia into the Ukraine,' Mr Abbott said.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had invited Australia to 'fully participate' in any aspect of the investigation, including body recovery.

Mr Abbott offered to personally call families of victims of the crash but said he didn't want to intrude on people's grief.

A team of Australians had assembled in Kiev, the prime minister said.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop left for New York on Saturday night to lead Australia's campaign for a binding resolution at the UN Security Council to establish an independent investigation with full access to the crash site.

The disaster claimed almost 298 lives - including at least 36 Australian citizens and permanent residents.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten will join the push for an independent investigation when he travels to Washington to hold talks with US leaders, including Deputy Secretary of State William Burns.

Mr Shorten's meetings fit in around his participation in the 22nd Australian-American Leadership Dialogue.

The Opposition Leader and Mr Abbott were among dignitaries who attended a memorial service for MH17 victims at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney on Sunday.

A national day of mourning, marked by a national commemorative service, for all the Australian victims will be held in the next fortnight.
