Paedophile: Elvis impersonator Louis Fella, pictured in costume, admitted child pornography charges

An Elvis impersonator who sang for Sir Elton John at a celebrity party has been exposed as a paedophile.

Louis Fella - stage name Louis Rockafella - performed his tribute act for celebrities, on national television and in front of thousand-strong audiences in Las Vegas.

But he was this month exposed as a paedophile when a cache of more than 900 images of child abuse - some of which he had made himself - were found on his computer.

The court was told that some of the images seized by investigators were graded levels four and five - the most severe - on the SAP scale.

Images of this severity usually show sex between children and adults, sadism or even bestiality.

Fella pleaded guilty to pleaded guilty to 12 counts of making indecent images and seven counts of distributing images between November 2009 and April 2013 at Liverpool Crown Court.

The court heard that the impersonator, who boasts of having won Elvis look- and sound-alike competitions, even shared his collection with other paedophiles over the internet.

Fella, of Southport, Merseyside, was granted bail but banned from having unsupervised contact with any child aged under 16. He will be sentenced on July 17.

On his website, Fella says his 30-year career began when he was just 12 years old.

He goes on to describe his 12-year stint with the Army before returning to music.

Fella appeared in a 2002 BBC documentary, There’s Only One Elvis, to mark 25 years since the rock 'n' roll legend's death.

He was also signed to Sony BMG records in 2002 to promote an Elvis greatest hits album, which has sold more than 300million copies in Europe.

His musical career has also seen him appear on The Jerry Springer Show, and a special Elvis-themed edition of the Weakest Link on New Year's day in January 2003, on which he sang to Anne Robinson.

Since his conviction, Fella has begun to be shunned by the bars and clubs where he once plied his trade.

Last he arrived uninvited to perform at the Marine Lake Café in Southport and performed Elvis hits for tips from customers.

One employee, who did not want to be 
named, said: 'We’re absolutely disgusted with what he did and we never 
want anything to do with him.

'He came in yesterday out of the blue which he’s done in the past and he still denied everything.

'He sang a couple of songs for tips and then he was on his way. He’s been here about five or six times in the past but we’ve never actually employed him.

'Everyone’s been completely shocked about the news and quite frankly, we’ve washed our hands of him.

'None of this is our fault and we feel duped by Louis. We told him never to come back and he’ll never be welcome in here ever again.'
