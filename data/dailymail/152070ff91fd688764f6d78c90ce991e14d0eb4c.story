From misspelled words to Chinese characters used at random and Hindi 'phrases' that are really gibberish, not every inking turns out as expected.

Now it seems that getting rid of an unwanted tattoo has pitfalls of its own as Elspeth, a 29-year-old sales manager discovered when she attempted to have hers removed.

Instead of erasing her unwanted etching, botched laser surgery left her skin badly burned while failing to make any difference to the tattoo itself.

Not happy: Elspeth was badly burned and left with terrible scarring after laser tattoo removal went wrong

'I imagine that for some people it would be a small problem but for me, it's quite big,' she explains.

'I'm trying to make it in my career and I constantly see people looking at it when I wear skirts and high heels.'

Elspeth's tattoo trouble began at the age of 19 when, in a moment of teenage madness, she decided to get some permanent art etched on her ankle.

Days later, she realised she had made a catastrophic mistake and decided to get the offending tattoo removed.

'I felt it was tacky,' she explains, 'so I started to get it lasered but after a few sessions, it [the tattoo] got really, really bad.'

Hidden: Elspeth has to use medical concealer to hide the tattoo - which has resisted all attempts to remove it

Getting better: Elspeth is embarking on a new course of laser surgery and hopes to be rid of it one day

Despite her concerns, the woman in charge reassured her that pain and scabbing were normal so Elspeth continued to attend appointments.

But things were about to get worse. 'It got infected, to the point that skin was dropping off,' she reveals.

'I
 really should have gone to the GP but I just trusted this woman. It 
became a horrible combination of scar, burn, tattoo, everything in one.'

Now Elspeth is to appear on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters in a bid to finally remove the offending etching, which, thanks to the scarring, has so far resisted every subsequent attempt to remove it.

So bad is the scarring left by the botched lasering, Elspeth has had to resort to cosmetic camouflage - a type of concealer originally created for burns victims - to hide it.

Speaking about the camouflage, Elspeth adds: 'I really love it. I feel like I've gone back 10 years. It's liberating to be able to stand without having to try and camouflage it.

'Camouflage took a while to master but 
I'm very grateful they taught me to do it. I've used it for weddings and
 business meetings. It's given me a lot of confidence.'

She has also embarked on a new course of laser therapy, this time with a reputable professional and hopes, one day, to be able to give up the body paint.Â 

'I'm really excited to see the results,' she adds. 'In a few week's time, I'm sure I will see less and less ink.

'I'm looking forward to stopping the camouflage, as happy as I was with it. It's too difficult to put on every day so I'm hoping that at some point in the future, I'll be able to go out again and just show off my legs.'
