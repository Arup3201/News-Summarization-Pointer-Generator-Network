Arsenal have shamelessly altered their customer charter to allow them to change all three of their new Puma-supplied shirts every season.

The club’s merchandising code of conduct stated at the start of last week that the home strip would stay in place for a ‘minimum of two years’.

But that promise was no longer there last Thursday when the club launched their Puma kit. Now home, away and third-choice strips last just one campaign — with the amended charter dating from the Puma launch saying: ‘Kits will have a life-span of one season.’

‘We changed the charter for transparency reasons,’ said a club spokesman. ‘There is a huge demand from our fans for new kit every year, similar to other clubs.’

Meanwhile, Arsenal and their supporters are furious with the club’s official partner BT Sport for using last season’s 5-1 defeat at Liverpool and 6-0 beating by Chelsea in TV and radio advertising for the new season.

A BT spokesman said: ‘We are sorry our TV ad has offended some fans.’

UEFA have also forced BT Sport to drop their Gareth Bale promotion for the 2015-16 Champions League because BT’s advertising rights for the tournament haven’t started yet.

The R&A are expected to select 15 to 20 women members after the inevitable ‘yes’ vote in the St Andrews referendum on September 18 - rather than a token female representation as at Augusta.

The first intake of R&A women is likely to include former world No 1 Annika Sorenstam , whose European junior tournament is supported by St Andrews. The BBC’s Open golf presenter Hazel Irvine could also join the R&A membership.

Korean golfer YE Yang was so impressed by the course knowledge of caddie Mal Jones during a practice round that he has signed up the Hoylake local to carry his bag in The Open.

That last-minute decision makes gobbledegook of Open sponsors HSBC’s bid to grab publicity by commissioning Loughborough University research to show the impact of a caddie. It revealed the right bagman can improve a golfer’s performance by 30 per cent.

Another poor publicity stunt has seen Betfair placing their giant Octopus advertising figure on a house overlooking the fourth green to showcase betting markets. The R&A swiftly ordered it to be removed, despite it being  outside their grounds.

The Association of Golf Writers’ annual awards dinner at The Open had always been a rich feeding ground for stories due to the terrible speeches that were a marvellous feature of the event.

But sadly that is no longer the case with the AGW closing the door on any controversy by no longer having speakers. Instead, BBC Radio 5 Live’s golf correspondent Iain Carter conducts interviews.

The ageist agenda that has caused problems for many talented female BBC broadcasters certainly doesn’t impact on the Beeb’s continuing employment of 83-year-old Peter Alliss. He is on a roll-over contract, with BBC golf boss Paul Davies saying: ‘Age doesn’t come into it, Peter is as good as ever.’

So worryingly it looks like Alliss will stay behind the mic until the current Open contract ends in 2016, when Sky will challenge strongly for the rights.

R&A chief executive Peter Dawson, reacting to questions about Sports Agenda’s story that the BBC are in danger of losing The Open, said: ‘The value of golf rights has accelerated dramatically, particularly in the US, just in the last 12 months. And that’s a bigger item in the equation than it might otherwise have been.’

Dawson also wants to avoid the regular clash between The Open and the Lord’s Test.

On the same day adidas announced their £750m Manchester United kit contract, their golf arm TaylorMade surprisingly did not hold their traditional pre-Open event, leaving Callaway to grab all the attention.

TaylorMade’s excuse was they had already paraded Justin Rose before the Scottish Open.
