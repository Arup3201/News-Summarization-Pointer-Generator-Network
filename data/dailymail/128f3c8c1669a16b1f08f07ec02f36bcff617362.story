Furor is building in Los Angeles over video of BMX riders hopping over homeless people on Skid Row.

A video shot last month showing pro BMX riders Brandon Begin, Jeff Cadger and David Grant bunny hopping sleeping homeless people in the seedy neighborhood has upset many, and so has the video poster’s lack of remorse of the shocking footage.

Bike store owner Adam Grandmaison initially apologized on Facebook to anyone offended by the video, but has since gone on multiple rants against those offended and even written a column saying the footage is good for the sport.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Shocking: BMX riders used Skid Row homeless as props for stunts in a video shot last month

Up and over: This homeless person watches helplessly as a BMX rider bunny hops over his legs

The fifteen second video posted February 26 to Facebook shows the trio bunny hopping over the legs of destitute people in LA’s drug-addled Skid Row.

Multiple riders are shown even doing tricks in the air over the people while treating them as worthless props.

‘This is just a matter of not having value for another human being,’ Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson Deon Joseph told NBC Los Angeles.

The LAPD has not brought any criminal charges against the riders because it does not believe any laws were broken, a department source told CBS Los Angeles, but others were still outraged over the video.

‘Homeless people should be treated with respect and they’re not furniture,’ a person told NBC LA.

‘That’s not right, it’s not right,’ a homeless person told the station.

‘It’s exploitation of the homeless people,’ said another.

Grandmaison’s initial apology to Facebook drew derision from many who pointed out that he refused to delete the post.

‘Then remove the video... [what the f**k] is wrong with you?’ Asked A.J. Herrera.

'Unacceptable: Many people spoke out against the video posting on the BMX store's Facebook page

'Take it down': Others called for the video to be removed

Infamous: Skid Row has long been home to homeless and drug addicts

‘Good for you for saying that you don’t condone it... now take down the video,’ said Yosi Sergant.

Others called the original post on the bike store’s Facebook page was ‘a horrible display of inhumanity’ and ‘unacceptable.’ Multiple people called it disrespectful.

Grandmaison told CBS LA that if he has ‘to take a little flack for something that’s controversial in order for people to realize there is a big BMX scene out in LA, [he] can deal with it.’

Those comments came after he told NBC LA that he didn’t see why people were offended by the video.

‘All’s well that ends well, I guess, you know, because nobody did get hurt,’ he added.

He also wrote in a skating magazine that ‘maybe, just maybe, some little kid will see that video and get motivated to ride down the street and bunnyhop over some s**t, human or not,’ according to multiple reports.

Begin is sponsored by the store on whose Facebook page the video was posted, according to reports. The store's owner initially tried to deny anyone involved with the store had anything to do with the video

Neither of the three riders has publicly commented on the video, they were not able to be reached by MailOnline.
