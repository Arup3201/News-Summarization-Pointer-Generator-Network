Arsene Wenger remains suspicious about Manchester City’s swoop to sign Frank Lampard before he begins life at New York City, their sister club in the USA.

The Premier League champions confirmed on Wednesday that Lampard has joined the club on a six-month contract until January 31 when he will move on to New York City FC for the MLS season.

Lampard's deal to the Etihad has been questioned by some following City's relationship with the American franchise, with Wenger one of those to express his displeasure at the transfer.

Unhappy: Wenger has raised concerns about City's move for Lampard as a way of moving around FFP

Earlier in August, the Arsenal boss raised concerns that the England international's deal is a way for City to navigate UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.

The 64-year-old re-laid those fears sarcastically again on Thursday, when asked about his thoughts on the transfer.

‘It was a surprise that he went to Manchester City,' Wenger said.

‘He went to New York first and the shortest way to Manchester is not to travel to New York first. If you look at a map there is a shorter way.’

Lampard became a free agent in the summer after 13 years at Chelsea during which he became the club’s record goal scorer.

The Chelsea legend is believed to harbour doubts about playing his former side and to avoid any embarrassment, City are happy to let him go to America before the end of January in order to begin pre-season work for the MLS which starts in early March.

They face Chelsea at home on September 21.

Lampard trained for the first time with his new City team-mates in traditional soggy Manchester conditions on Wednesday and after a brief team meeting outside, moved inside to the club’s Carrington training centre to do gym work.

The 36-year-old will wear the No 18 shirt that was vacated by Gareth Barry following his move to Everton this summer.
