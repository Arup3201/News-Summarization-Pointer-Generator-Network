Stacked up against Ikea flatpack furniture, this was the moment nine Albanian stowaways were caught trying to sneak into the country.

The foreign nationals spent 14 hours in a tiny hideaway before being discovered in the largest immigration interception at a North East port.

UK Border Agency officials intercepted the Romanian registered vehicle, which was on its way to deliver furniture to an Ikea store in Gateshead, after sniffer dogs picked up a scent at North Shields ferry terminal.

Covered in dirt, the stowaways, all aged between 20 and 50, were found in a hidden compartment of the lorry, and questioned before being sent back to The Netherlands, The Newcastle Evening Chronicle reported.

Last week the lorries set off from Bucharest in Romania and travelled across Europe to Amsterdam where it is believed the Albanians, desperate for a life in Britain, were staying.

John Spence, assistant director at the UKBA, told the Newcastle Evening Chronicle: 'Officers at Tyne Dock use the latest technology, sniffer dogs and their own experience and expertise to stay one step ahead of illegal immigrants.

'The UK Border Agency’s strong presence at the frontier helps protect the whole country from people illegally entering the UK and then heading for places across Britain.

'We will not hesitate to take strong action against hauliers who fail to secure their vehicles.'

UKBA officers use hi-tech search equipment to combat immigration crime and also detect banned and restricted goods that smugglers attempt to bring into the country.

They use an array of search techniques including detection dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors and scanners, as well as visual searches to find well-hidden stowaways, illegal drugs, firearms and cigarettes.

The haulier was later fined £5,000.
