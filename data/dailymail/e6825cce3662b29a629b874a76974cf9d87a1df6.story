An innocent man who  spent 18 years in prison including a dozen in solitary confinement after being wrongfully convicted of the murders of six people is fighting for reform in Texas's justice system.

Anthony Graves, now 49, was sentenced to death in 1994 after being found guilty of killing two adults and four children in Somerville, Texas, in 1992 based on a co-defendant's false testimony.

Despite prosecutors failing to present any physical evidence, he was forced to spend 18 years behind bars and was scheduled for a lethal injection twice before eventually being freed in 2010.

For 12 of his years in prison, Graves was held in solidarity confinement, which saw him spend at least 22 hours a day locked alone in a tiny concrete cell with a metal bed and a toilet.

Now, the free man, who was released after the key witness in the trial recanted his testimony and a judge ruled the prosecutor had withheld evidence, is seeking what he deems 'life-saving' reform.

Speaking to Take Part, Graves, who was also  jailed after the prosecutor intimidated witnesses, said long-term isolation can lead to psychological damage that lasts even when an inmate is freed.

'Solitary confinement is designed to break a man's will to live,' he said. 'You're sitting there, in a little cage, day in and day out, year in and year out, waiting for the state to execute you or release you.'

While he was on Texas's death row, Graves  said he 'witnessed men just literally, literally losing their minds'. Some of them resorted to slitting their own throats to escape from the torment, he said.

Those who were released went into the outside word 'with a lot of baggage', including PTSD and hypersensitivity, he said, adding that he himself would often burst into tears for no reason.

'The first three years I was out…I couldn't even hold a conversation with people without crying,' he said. Graves also suffered from difficulty sleeping, but his condition eventually improved, he said.

Release: 'Solitary confinement is designed to break a man's will to live,' said Graves (pictured speaking to reporters after his release from prison in 2010). He said it had psychologically affected him after his release

More than 6,500 inmates in Texas are currently living in solitary confinement, according to a report by the ACLU of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project, which was published last week. 

However, this figure does not include prisoners who are on death row. Inmates typically remain in solitary confinement in the state for nearly four years before being transferred or released.

But more than 100 prisoners have been in solitary for more than 20 years, the report says. 

The inmates are forced to live in conditions that 'impose such severe deprivations' that they are left psychologically damaged and more likely to commit crimes again upon release, it claims.

'We met with people who were profoundly mentally ill. So mentally ill we didn't feel comfortable sharing their stories in this report,'  attorney Burke Butler, who helped produce the report, said.

Butler said that prisoners in solitary confinement are often forced to use their beds and toilets as tables for meals, cannot put up posters and will either have no window or a tiny strip of glass.

He added that these dire conditions mean that correctional officers have little control over inmates - because there are no longer privileges that can be removed for bad behavior.

'When someone's in solitary, they have nothing to lose. Their lives are miserable,' he said.

According to the report, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice holds more than 4 percent of its prisoners in solitary confinement - around four times more than the national average. 

In recent years, other states have started to limit the practice of placing prisoners in solitary confinement amid concerns it can result in damage their mental health in the long run.

Last month, New York's Rikers Island, the second biggest prison in America, banned such confinement for inmates under the age of 21, Take Part reported.  

Speaking to ACLU in 2012, Graves said: 'Solitary confinement is driving men crazy. I don't understand how someone can subject another human being to this type of punishment and think that it's justified. 

'It is totally inhumane. There's no way around it. You know, you really don't truly understand the impact of removing someone from human contact for years. It has a negative effect on that person.

'I experienced that so many times, where I'm shouting, 'I'm there. I want- - I want somebody to just, you know, come talk to me, you know, just shake my hand'... And I couldn't get it.'

Graves, who has created a foundation for reform of the criminal justice system, added: 'We're driving people crazy. And this is our criminal justice system that's supposed to serve and protect us.

'But we are literally driving men insane. And those that are already insane, we're just putting them in the casket. That's all we're doing. There's no rehabilitation.'

When Graves was released in October 2010, he blamed his 1994 conviction and subsequent death sentence on lawmakers who follow polls that show enduring support for the death penalty.

'What has to happen is someone famous, someone that they admire, has to be falsely accused or has to be convicted, to where they say, 'Oh my God, this has become an epidemic,' because now they can relate,' he said in an interview at the time. 

But he was also overwhelmingly grateful to the people who had helped to get him out, including local college students, members of the public and his attorneys, CBS News reported. 

The American Psychological Association advises that prisoners who are considered 'mentally ill' should not be placed in solitary confinement because it could exacerbate their health issues.
