Brendan Rodgers is planning to give Raheem Sterling a break after the busy Christmas period to ensure the 20-year-old forward can last the season.

Sterling has already played 58 games for club and country in 2014 and Rodgers is devising a plan to give him a rest before he burns out.

The forward has been in good form recently and scored twice against Bournemouth as a central striker in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night.

‘Raheem will have a rest,’ confirmed Rodgers. ‘There will be a period that is already mapped out for him of when he will come out and have that breather and that recovery after Christmas.

‘There is a set period we will look at, it doesn’t have to wait until Daniel Sturridge comes back from injury.’

After Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, Liverpool play at Burnley on Boxing Day, Swansea on December 29, Leicester on New Year’s Day and then AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round on January 5.

They will then face five further fixtures before the end of January including the important two-legged Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea towards the end of the month.

Sterling was at the centre of a controversy known as “Tiredgate” when England manager Roy Hodgson said the player had complained of being tired before England’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia. Rodgers denied the player had said that and called the aftermath “unfair”.

The Liverpool manager is defensive of his young talent saying criticism towards him this season has been over-the-top.

And he has thought carefully about how to give the player time to recharge his batteries.

‘Raheem is similar to Wayne Rooney in that he is better in rhythm. I love Wayne Rooney, I think he is a brilliant player, but take him out for a couple of games and he is not the same player.

‘Raheem is in that mould, if you take him out of rhythm it takes him a while to get going again. He is a boy who is better in rhythm and in games.’
