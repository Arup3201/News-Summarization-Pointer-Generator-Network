Amid the violence, destruction, protests, and nationwide division since a grand jury's failure to indict a white police officer who killed an unarmed black teen on Nov. 25, hope in humanity has been restored, through, what is being called, the hug shared 'round the world.

During an emotional rally in Portland, Oregon, freelance photographer Johnny Nguyen snapped a photo of a 12-year-old black boy Devonte Hart as he hugged white police officer, Portland Police Sgt. Bret Barnum with tears in his eyes, according to the Oregonian. 

'I came upon this boy who had tears in his eyes and I knew this was the place to be,' Nguyen told the Oregonian, 'so I followed him in the crowd.

'Then he came upon the police officer. They talked and he gave him a hug.'

Emotional: During an emotional rally in Portland, Oregon, a 12-year-old black boy, Devonte Hart, with tears in his eyes, embraced a white police officer, Portland Police Sgt. Bret Barnum

Do I?: Hart was holding a sign at the rally that read 'free hugs,' Barnum saw the boy and motioned him over. Barnum motioned toward the boy's sign and asked 'Do I get one of those?'

Hart was holding a sign at the rally that read 'free hugs,' Barnum saw the boy and motioned him over as speakers addressed the crowd. 

Barnum told the Oregonian that the two began talking about the demonstration, school, life and art. Afterward, Barnum motioned toward the boy's sign and asked 'Do I get one of those?'

It was then that the 12-year-old embraced the 21-year police veteran, ABC news reports.

After the emotional exchange, the two went their separate ways. Hart went back to his friends and family participating in the rally, and Barnum returned to his duties. 

Barnum has two teenage sons and has worked for Portland's police force for 21 years. While continuing to talk to Devonte, he looked at the 'Free Hugs' sign on the ground and asked if he might get a hug as well.

Devonte put his arms around the officer.

'Knowing how he struggled with police, his bravery and courage to catch my eye and approach me were impressive,' Barnum said. 

'And it's a blessing for me that I didn't miss an opportunity to impact this child.'

Kindnedd: Devonte's parents were often surprised by his genuine acts of kindness including when he asked to spend his eleventh and twelfth birthdays raising money for charity

ABC reports that seven people were arrested at the rally where several highways were closed down due to protesters entering the roadways.

What may have seemed to be a small, seemingly private exchange between the two quickly became known to the nation.

Since it's capture, the photo has been shared or viewed more than 100,000 on Facebook, it has been tweeted and favorited more than 4,000 times on Twitter and has received more that 900 'Likes' on Nguyen's Instagram account.

Protests: Since a grand jury's failure to indict Darren Wilson, the white police officer who killed an unarmed black teen, the nation has erupted in protest

Hart has an emotional story of his own. 

The 12-year-old was born to a drug addicted mother and by the age of four had smoked, consumed alcohol, handled firearms, and suffered severe neglect and abuse, according to Paper Trail.   

Devonte is one of six children adopted by Hart and her wife, Sarah Hart of West Linn, a suburb of Portland.

The boy's adoptive mother Jennifer Hart, who is white, wrote on social media that her son had been struggling with issues of police brutality and racism.

'Devonte was struggling. He wouldn't speak. He was inconsolable,' his mother wrote. 

'My son has a heart of gold, compassion beyond anything I've ever experienced, yet struggles with living fearlessly when it comes to the police... He wonders if someday when he no longer wears a 'Free Hugs' sign around his neck, when he's a full-grown black male, if his life will be in danger for simply being.'

Paper Trail reports that Devonte's parents were often surprised by his genuine acts of kindness including when he asked to spend his eleventh and twelfth birthdays raising money for charity and the time he hugged musician Xavier Rudd while at a festival. 

Hart said the moment was about 'listening to each other, facing fears with an open heart.'

Earlier that week, when an officer posted on Facebook a badge of the Portland Police Bureau with an 'I am Darren Wilson' banner, Barnum had 'liked' the post. The officers were later ordered to remove the images and the matter is under an internal investigation.

Barnum said he 'liked' the image out of solidarity for the police profession, not because he supports Wilson.
