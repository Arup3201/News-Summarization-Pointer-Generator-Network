Marc Wroe, who was jailed for 18 weeks at Preston Magistrates Court after a seven-year stalking campaign against a married colleague  

An officer worker secretly urinated in a married colleague's water bottle during a seven-year stalking campaign where she repeatedly spurned his advances.

Marc Wroe, 44, kept pestering mother-of-one Heather Kendall with a string of suggestive emails while working together at a distribution company in Preston.

She received mystery parcels of ladies underwear, lingerie catalogues and samples in the post plus Valentine’s cards addressed to her husband posted to her home and bunches of 'apology' flowers.

Wroe, from Preston, Lancashire, also turned up unannounced at her home late night whilst her daughter was in bed and whilst her husband was away on business.

Police were eventually called in after Mrs Kendall noticed the liquid in her bottle of sparking water which she kept on her desk had a 'foul smell' and went to her bosses.

CCTV cameras were installed at the distribution company where they worked and captured Wroe sneaking past her desk, taking the sparkling water bottle with him and returning with it full of liquid.

Tests then showed it was contaminated with his own urine.

Today Wroe was jailed for 18 weeks after he admitted harassment between July 2007 and April 2014.

In a statement she said she thought Wroe was trying to 'play a twisted, perverted game' with her.

She said the stalking campaign left her feeling 'dirty and suspicious of people' and was now 'living her life on pins.’

She also added she could not even go to the supermarket for fear of bumping into her tormentor.

Preston Magistrates Court was told the the victim’s ordeal began in 2007 when she started receiving emails from Wroe as they worked together at Tom Parker Ltd in Preston.

Prosecuting Miss Alex Mann said the messages started out as 'harmless emails at work' but said Mrs Kendall 'wasn’t interested' in Wroe and she emailed him at home asking him not to send her so many messages at work.

Miss Mann said: 'The contact continued even after she asked him to stop. She said the content wasn’t professional - it was a bit sexually suggestive..

'He was told by the police not to contact her. Contact did stop for about six months, unfortunately other things happened after that.

'She says the defendant was turning up at her home at 10pm knocking at the door. Her husband was away with business she was home alone with her child. It unnerved her.

'She was concerned how he knew where she lived. She did get flowers sent as an apology.

'He continued to email her. She sent a reply telling him to leave her alone but he didn’t take any notice.'

Victim Heather Kendall, who found that Wroe had urinated in her water bottle while they were both working for a distribution company in Preston 

The emails got more and more explicit and on one occasion, Wroe commented on an item of underwear he had seen in Mrs Kendall’s bag, which was belonged to her daughter.

After an incident in which Wroe turned up at her home, a colleague warned him off but Mrs Kendall believed Wroe was watching her every move.

She eventually told her partner everything after catching him staring at her as she got into her car.

Miss Mann added that the victim’s statement told of her becoming 'scared' of his behaviour and was concerned that it wasn’t right.

She added: 'It affected her work life, home life and impacted on her relationship with her partner and child. She was constantly upset.

he goes on to mention at work she felt that her water bottle smelt a bit funny, she noticed a particularly foul smell that reminded her of urine, it was clear that it was in it.'

Last February she went to the director, and was said to be 'shaking' saying she felt awful she had to work with someone who hated her so much.

When it happened again, tests showed her water was contaminated and the firm set up cameras on.

Three days later, Wroe was caught contaminating her water. He was sacked.

Miss Mann said: 'The cameras did show the defendant leaving with the water bottles and returning with them. It happened more than once. She was scared what could happen in the future. She didn’t know what she had done to deserve this.”

Cameras were installed at the Tom Parker Ltd in Preston and tests revealed that the water bottle had been contaminated with urine 

She added that the victim had always spoken to him in a 'courteous' and 'professional' manner.

Miss Mann said Wroe had previously been handed a caution for public damage and public order offence in the past.

She added: 'It seems he has simply targeted this lady for whatever reason.'

In mitigation, Wroe’s lawyer Greg Earnshaw said that his client had been sacked as result of his behaviour.

Mr Earnshaw said : 'The defendant has expressed remorse and done so by writing directly to the court. It has hung over his head for some time.

'He has obviously lost his job, he will probably lose his employability. He is not work shy. He is ashamed by the publicity. He is thinking of moving from the area. He is not suffering from any mental disorders.'

But passing sentence district judge Jane Goodwin said: 'This was extremely serious behaviour that continued over seven years, although not constant it was behaviour in a work place.

'It is accepted there were sexual connotations by way of emails. You ignored warnings not only from your victim but the work place too. It appears you were fixated with Mrs Kendall. You visited her address late in the evening. She hadn’t provided you with that and it heightened her anxiety.'

Wroe who appeared in the dock with his head bowed throughout was also banned from contacting Mrs Kendall for three years and was ordered not to go within 100 metres of Tom Parker Ltd.

Mrs Kendall refused to speak after the hearing saying only she was “pleased” with the sentence.
