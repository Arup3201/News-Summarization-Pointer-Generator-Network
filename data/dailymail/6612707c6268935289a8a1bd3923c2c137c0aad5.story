Online attack: Connor Brown accused the victim of being a 'money grabbing little tramp'

A teammate of the footballer jailed last week for raping a teenager has been suspended by his club after he branded the victim a 'money grabbing little tramp'.

Soon after Sheffield United striker Ched Evans was convicted, reserve player Connor Brown posted Twitter messages about the case, including a personal attack on the woman.

The club said it has launched an investigation into the 19-year-old's social network posts, which were passed on to North Wales Police by a leading rape charity.

A club statement read: 'Sheffield United Football Club have suspended reserve team player Connor Brown with immediate effect pending an internal investigation into comments apparently posted on his personal Twitter account.

'There will be no further comment from the club during the process of the investigation which it hopes to conclude swiftly.'

The suspension follows a storm that erupted as the victim was named on the social networking website.

Police promised a ‘robust’ investigation after the girl was identified and abused on the internet within hours of Wales international Evans being found guilty of the attack.

Her name was being circulated so widely that it is understood to have been one of the top ‘trending’, or most used, words on the Twitter site over the weekend.

The victim was last night said by her family to have been ‘traumatised’ by the loss of her anonymity and the Attorney General has warned that those who published her name could face prosecution.

Sheffield United player Evans, 23, was sentenced to five years in jail on Friday for raping the 19-year-old in a hotel after a night out in Rhyl, North Wales last May.

He admitted having sex with the victim but she told police she had no memory of the incident and believed her drinks had been spiked. Evans’s friend, the Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, 23, also admitted having sex with the victim but was found not guilty of the same charge.

Despite his conviction he was this week named in the Professional Footballer Association League One Team of the Year.

Organisers defended the decision to include him in the award as a 'footballing judgement' and not a moral one.

Soon after Evans was convicted, his teammate Brown took to Twitter to post comments about the case and the victim.

A number of supporters joined in, with one writing: ‘Birds that **** footballers then accuse them of rape are complete compensation-grabbing ***s. They need shooting.’

Personal abuse against the victim on the internet soon escalated into messages in which she was named.

Jonathan Cox from Sheffield published her name, saying she ‘isn’t a victim she’s a whore’. Joshua Laughton, also from Sheffield, tweeted the name of the victim before sharing another user’s message saying ‘she’s got a massive reputation in Rhyl for doing similar things’.

Both Cox and Laughton have since removed their messages from Twitter.

Rape victims are granted lifelong anonymity by the courts and publishing a name is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to £5,000.

North Wales Police have described the comments on Twitter as ‘profoundly disturbing’ and say they contribute to the young woman’s ‘continued trauma’.Last night her family revealed she was ‘traumatised, shocked and deeply upset’ at being identified by Twitter users.

Tirade: Connor Brown took to his Twitter to comment on the verdict and the victim

The most high-profile leak on Twitter was the naming of footballer Ryan Giggs as he tried to protect his identity.

Giggs, 38, took out an injunction last April to prevent the media from reporting allegations that he had an extra-marital affair with former Big Brother contestant Imogen Thomas and allegations that she had blackmailed him.

The Manchester United star was the subject of so much speculation on Twitter that eventually Lib Dem MP John Hemming 'outed' him in the House of Commons.

Her mother said: ‘Putting her name  on Twitter is just another horrendous ordeal for her and we have been assured the police are going to come down like a ton of bricks on these people.’

The teenager is understood to have had counselling following the rape.

Evans has been the top scorer for Sheffield United this season, scoring 29 League goals, and he was named in the Professional Footballers’ Association League One team of the year on Sunday. Voting took place before his conviction.

The sister of the victim believes she has been abused because of Evans’s popularity as a footballer. She said: ‘People are only doing it because he is a footballer, I think it is absolutely disgusting and the whole family are shocked.’

While newspapers and television broadcasters follow court anonymity rulings, they are often ignored on the internet and postings are usually difficult to remove once they have been published.

Labour MP Louise Ellman said: ‘The naming of any rape victim should be condemned, anonymity is crucial and this case should be pursued by the authorities.’

North Wales Police have begun collecting evidence. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Williams said: ‘As and when criminal offences are identified on such websites they will be dealt with robustly and the offenders will be brought to justice.’

A spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office said: ‘Rape victims have lifetime anonymity and the publication of a rape victim’s name is a criminal offence.’

When confronted about his Twitter message Cox, 20, said:  ‘What Ched Evans did was totally unacceptable but there are thousands of people tweeting about it, not just me.

‘I didn’t think about the content before passing it on. I didn’t even know if it was the girl involved or not.’

Sheffield United yesterday announced an internal probe into the tweets from Brown.

Jailed footballer Ched Evans is being supported by his girlfriend and her wealthy family despite being convicted of raping a teenager.

Natasha Massey, 24, lives with her  parents in a £1.5million property in  Alderley Edge, Cheshire, close to the homes of Manchester United’s Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra.

Her father Karl Massey is a director  of 11 companies, including prestigious jewellers Cottrills in nearby Wilmslow, which is popular with the privileged ‘Cheshire set’.

Evans and Miss Massey, who have been dating for two years, have been photographed with a rare 1972 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Spyder in a promotion for the jewellers.

They were also pictured together at  a Cottrills ‘Rolex dinner’, described as  an ‘evening of fine dining, fine wines and a tasting of the very rarest Dom Perignon vintages’.

Miss Massey is understood to have told her friends that she will stand by her boyfriend and that she is still ‘deeply in love’ with him.

Her mother Susan has also expressed her support for the Sheffield United striker who was sentenced to five years in jail on Friday.

On the day he was sentenced she tweeted: ‘Absolutely devastated! My love goes to Tash and Ched! He is INNOCENT.’ Natasha’s sister Imogen, 19, tweeted: ‘I’m in shock! He’s innocent! This can’t happen!’

There was no answer at the Massey home when the Daily Mail called last night.

The detached mansion, which sits in acres of gardens, had a BMW, a Jaguar and two motorcycles on the drive.
