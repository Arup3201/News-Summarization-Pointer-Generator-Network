eBay paid just £620,000 in corporation tax on sales of more than £1billion last year, its latest accounts show.

The online auction site shaved tens of millions of pounds off its British tax bill by legally channelling payments through Luxembourg and Switzerland.

The news will reignite the row over the number of global firms that use loopholes to reduce their tax liabilities in the UK.

eBay paid just £620,000 in UK taxes in 2013 despite its American parent company headquarters pictured) reporting sales of more than £1billion 

US parent company eBay Inc announced that its UK arm had achieved sales of £1.3billion in 2013. But eBay UK Ltd officially reported sales of just £164million and a profit of merely £12.4million. 

On this, it only paid 5 per cent corporation tax – or £620,000 – rather than the usual 23 per cent, after capitalising on generous Treasury tax breaks.

The company makes its revenue by charging fees to sellers and takes a small slice of the proceeds of their sales as commission. 

It also has extra charges for those who sell a lot of goods at fixed prices.

eBay is the latest global chain to be accused of using complex overseas accounting to reduce its full tax responsibilities. 

Yesterday, campaigners urged the Government to close its tax loopholes.

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘Many companies making huge profits in the UK are effectively deciding how little tax they will pay.

‘If the Government were to close down the many tax loopholes that exist, big corporations and wealthy individuals would no longer be able to avoid paying the millions in tax the exchequer is owed.’

Ikea has also been accused of sending money abroad to avoid taxes despite acting legally in its handling of funds

Starbucks customers threatened to boycott the chain last year after it was revealed the coffee retailer hadn't paid corporation tax in the UK for three years 

Fees paid to eBay by British sellers are sent to a related company, PayPal (Europe) Sarl, in the tax haven of Luxembourg. Meanwhile, eBay UK provides ‘services’ to its Swiss counterpart eBay International AG.

Starbucks and Ikea used similar schemes to avoid hefty tax bills, and Apple was criticised this year for paying £11.4million in corporation tax after record sales of £10.5billion.

Had eBay paid 5 per cent corporation tax on its full profits of around £300million, it would have had to pay £15million. At 23 per cent, the bill would have been £70million.

It said: ‘eBay complies fully with all applicable tax laws and regimes.’
