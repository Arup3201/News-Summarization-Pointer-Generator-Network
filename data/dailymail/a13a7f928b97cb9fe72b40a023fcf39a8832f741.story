Joey Barton has claimed that Wayne Rooney has not progressed since breaking on to the scene at Everton 12 years ago.

The QPR midfielder told BBC Radio 5 live Sport that he did not believe that Rooney was in the same ‘world class’ bracket as the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi and has then taken to Twitter to defend his comments.

'Rooney could have been world class but look at his mentality compared to Cristiano Ronaldo. Polar opposites,' he told 5 live Sport.

Breaking through: Rooney burst onto the scene as a teenager at Everton in 2002

'Why does Ronaldo achieve what he achieves and Rooney doesn't? When you see Wayne Rooney smoking cigarettes, does he live his life correctly?

'From the questions I've asked of players who have worked with both... he (Ronaldo) is in the gym or honing his game.

'The level of discipline he has for his chosen profession is the reason he is the best player in the world at the present time, and that's the reason Rooney isn't.'

Speaking his mind: Joey Barton has never been shy in voicing his opinion

On Twitter, Barton then added: ‘I would have to argue that he has not been better since he broke on the scene at Everton. For me that’s when he stopped developing or just afterwards. As I say, he is a top player. My favourite of the current bunch. Love watching him. Old school. But not world class.

‘He is infinitely better than me. That is not the debate here. But I was never world class, so people are missing the point.

‘Now shall I tell you what world class is for me. Ronaldo and Messi, Iniesta and Suarez. World class is a term thrown about far too often.’
