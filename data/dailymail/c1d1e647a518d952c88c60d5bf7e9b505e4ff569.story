At the age of almost four, Elijah Edney has never had a haircut in  his life.

But now he can’t wait to visit the barber’s – for two reasons. Losing his 2ft long golden tresses will mean that strangers stop mistaking him for a girl.

And the hair will be donated to charity, to provide a wig for a child with cancer or other conditions.

Elijah Edney needs to raise £350 for his hair to be turned into a wig for children with cancer. He has never had his hair cut but decided to take his first trip to the barbers because he is mistaken for a girl.

Amber Edney, 27, Elijah's mother, let him grow his hair but now he wants it cut because people think he is a girl

Elijah’s mother Amber, 27, a dinner lady, said: ‘People say, “Oh, what a cute girl” to me, and Elijah has to say, “I am a boy”.’

Mrs Edney and her husband Dean, from 
Buckland, Hampshire, will give their son’s locks to the Little Princess 
Trust, which helps youngsters suffering from hair loss.

Elijah, who has a six-year-old brother, Beau, is looking forward to having a spiky, two-inch crop.

Mrs Edney, a dinner lady, said: 'Elijah has always had beautiful hair, so I let him grow it like he wanted. It's like silk.

'But now it is at a stage where people mistake him for a girl and he wants it cut into a boy's haircut.

'He will be four next month but everyone thinks he is a girl and he's started to get frustrated.

Elijah's shorn hair will go to the Little Princess Trust, which makes wigs for children with cancer and other hair-loss illnesses.

Mrs Edney and Elijah's father, Dean Edney, want to collect enough money - £350 - to transform it into a wig for a sick child.

Mrs
Edney said: 'I couldn't bear to see all Elijah's beautiful hair go to 
waste and my mum mentioned about charities that use human hair to make 
into wigs.

The 2ft of hair will be donated to the Little Princess Trust to make a wig for children suffering with cancer

'He says that he no longer wants to have rock star hair and wants to look like his older brother.

'If we can raise the amount we want, it will mean a family will not have to pay for the wig to be made and can receive it free of charge.

'I'm over the half-way mark now, so fingers crossed I'll reach my target and can send off both the hair and the money.

'When you've got children yourself, you hope that if they lost their hair someone out there would do the same for them by donating their hair.

'For little girls, hair is so important so hopefully Elijah's hair will make someone very happy.'

Elijah's new hairdo will be a spiky two-inch crop. His older brother, six-year-old Beau, had shoulder-length hair until he was around Elijah's age.

A spokesman for the Little Princess Trust said: 'We're very grateful to anyone who decides to have their hair cut to donate it to the Little Princess Trust.

'As a result of hair donations such as this, the charity receives a large number of real-hair wigs free of charge to pass on to families whose children have sadly lost their own hair through cancer treatment.'
