Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage are preparing to launch deeply personal attacks on one another tonight as the two men clash in their second TV debate.

The gloves are expected to come off in the battle between the Lib Dem and Ukip leaders over the UK’s place in Europe and who can be trusted by the British people.

Mr Clegg will be attacked for his background as a career politician and lobbyist  while Mr Farage is under pressure after admitting he ‘admires’ Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The debate will be shown on BBC 2 tonight from 7pm.

Clash: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip's Nigel Farage are expected to launch personal attacks in tonight;s debate 

The two men go head-to-head on BBC2 from 7pm live from the BBC Radio Theatre

Immigration, regulations and EU expansion are expected to be among the subjects raised by the studio audience

Mr Clegg challenged Mr Farage to the debates ahead of elections to the European Parliament in May 22.

In the first clash last week on LBC radio and Sky News, immigration dominated with the two men trading detailed facts and figures.

A snap poll minutes after the debate showed 57 per cent thought Mr Farage had won, while only 36 per backed Mr Clegg.

However, a ComRes survey for MailOnline yesterday found 38 per cent think Mr Farage poses a ‘danger to Britain’ and ‘a bit sleazy’ while Mr Clegg is viewed as out of his depth.

Last week’s debate was dominated by rows over the use of statistics, with Mr Farage claiming 75 per cent of Britain’s laws come from Brussels and Mr Clegg insisting the figure was more like 7 per cent.

However, just 18 per cent of people said Mr Clegg 'tells the truth’ while 25 per cent said the same of Mr Farage.

Britain will eventually join the euro, former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Heseltine has claimed.

The Conservative grandee who still advises David Cameron said the UK always resists European 'ventures' but ends up taking part.

He also took a swipe at Ukip, claiming it has a 'racist undertone' which echoes Oswald Mosely in the 1920s.

In an interview with the New Statesman magazine, Lord Hesletin was asked if the UK would join the euro.

He replied: 'Oh yes, one day, one day. We have resisted all these European ventures in my life. We tried to keep out in Messina in 1955 [the conference that led to the creation of the European Economic Community].

'That was a very bad decision. Then we joined on terms which were not to our liking but were the best we could get.'

On Ukip he added: 'The racial overtones that are within the Ukip movement have got the same motivation [and] psychological impact as Mosley in the Twenties and Thirties, as Powell in the Sixties, Le Pen in France, the hard right in Holland and in Germany. It’s all the same stuff.

'There is a racist undertone, there’s no question about it.'

Senior Lib Dems say they expected Mr Clegg to make a more ‘emotional’ pitch to voters.

Leaving his home in South West London this morning, he told reporters: 'Nigel Farage is part of a group of people who have been pumping out misinformation for year after year after year.

'That’s not going to be reversed in one or even two hours of debate, but since no one else is prepared to actually tell the truth, spell it out like it is, that it makes no sense to be isolated in this world, that we’ve got to work with others to keep ourselves safe, to keep the economy strong, I’m going to continue to do that.;

He is expected to tackle Mr Farage again over his remarks about President Putin which have dominated the headlines since their first debate.

‘Compared with the kids who run foreign policy in this country I have got more respect for him than our lot,’ Mr Farage said this week.

Asked in the GQ interview which current world leader he admired most, Mr Farage replied: ‘As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say Putin. The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant.’

However, Mr Clegg has condemned the comments as ‘extreme’ and ‘utterly grotesque’, accusing President Putin of being ‘the chief sponsor and protector of one of the most brutal dictators on the face of the planet, President Assad’ in Syria.

At a press conference this week, the 
Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘This isn't a game. This is thousands upon 
thousands of people being killed and brutalised and murdered and chased 
from their homes who we are now taking into our country.

‘Women
 and children who have been sexually abused, who have been physically 
abused, and we are thankfully acting in a generous-hearted way to 
provide them refuge.

‘And he admires the man who has allowed, more than almost any other world leaders, that to happen?

‘I
 just think if your hatred of all things to do with the European Union 
leads to such a morally perverse conclusion - that you admire the one 
leader in the world who could have reined in President Assad - it really
 shows quite how extreme his views have become.’

In
 an apparent admission that his comments on Putin have left him exposed,
 Mr Farage today said he expected the issue to dominate tonight.

He
 told the BBC: 'They’re going to have a go at me over Putin because I’ve
 been wildly misquoted over that. I was asked a couple of months ago 
which world leader did I admire and I said Vladimir Putin as an 
operator, particularly the way he managed to stop the West getting 
militarily involved in Syria, but I don’t like him, I wouldn’t want to 
live there and I don’t like him as a human being. But I’m sure there 
will be a ding-dong over that.'

A snap poll after last week's LBC debate suggested Mr Farage had triumphed over Mr Clegg

Ahead of tonight's debate, both parties have claimed surges in their membership.

The Lib Dems say they have 44,000 members, up 500 this year but still down a third on the 65,000-plus levels it enjoyed before joining the Conservatives in coalition government in 2010.

At the same time Ukip has seen its membership soar, from 20,000 at the end of 2012 to 35,000 at the weekend.

Mr Farage has set his sights on overtaking the Lib Dems in terms of membership by the 2015 general elections.

Ex-Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom

Nigel Farage is just a good 'salesman' who cannot lead Ukip properly, his former flatmate Godfrey Bloom has claimed.

The
 ex-Ukip MEP, who was forced to quit after upstaging his leader at the 
party's conference last year, suggested Mr Farage had been in the job 
for too long.

'Nigel has been doing it for twenty years, I think perhaps one might argue that's too long,' Mr Bloom told the Telegraph.

He said Mr Farage is a 'charismatic' and 'articulate' salesman, but not a good 'managing director or chairman of the board'.

He suggested there were 'bright young people' in the party, who were being blocked by Mr Farage.

Mr
 Bloom caused a storm when he complained about foreign aid money being 
sent to 'Bongo Bongo Land', but was backed by Mr Farage.

However
 his comments calling a room of women 'sluts' on the day Mr Farage 
delivered his keynote conference speech led to him resigning to sit as 
an independent MEP.
