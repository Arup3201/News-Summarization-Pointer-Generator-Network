Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary once declared he was 'serious' about passengers being charged to use the toilet.

But today marks a new horizon for the budget airline, as it unveils its own version of business class, offering professional fliers a number of travel benefits.

The service, which will cost from €69.99 (£59.99), will include flexibility on ticket changes; 20kg checked-in bag allowance; fast track airport security at selected airports; priority boarding and premium seats.

Customer improvements: More than 25 per cent of Ryanair passengers are travelling on business

More than 25 per cent of Ryanair's customers business travellers, and the airline says that Business Plus just one of several improvements they are making to refine their business service, with the lowest fares, biggest route network and more city airport routes. 

Business Plus passengers will get priority boarding and the chance to sit in 'premium' seats - near the exits, with more leg room, which the airline normally charge £15 to reserve.

The carrier usually charges £90 to change a ticket, but Business Plus tickets allow passengers to change to another flight on the same day, to any airport in the same destination country, up to 40 minutes before departure for no extra fee.

They will also be allowed to put a bag weighing up to 20kg in the hold, which would normally cost up to £75 on busy routes.  

Ryanair now offer savings for businesses of all sizes, says  Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs

Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said: 'We now offer even more business routes, connecting Europe's major cities with additional flights and improved schedules, ensuring great savings for businesses of all sizes. 

'Our commitment to the improvement of our customer experience under our "Always Getting Better" programme continues, following the introduction of allocated seating, a free second carry-on bag, reduced fees, a new website, a brand new app with mobile boarding passes, and our dedicated family service, Ryanair Family Extra.' 

'The customer experience had a few rough edges that needed to be knocked off and we've done that.'

The changes could spell further misery for traditional airlines that have never fully come to terms with Ryanair's  rise from small regional carrier to continental giant.

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has praised easyJet for its success in attracting business travellers

Unable to fully replicate its ultra low-cost business model, most full-service airlines have been unable to cut prices far enough to stop an exodus of passengers and still turn a profit.

Business users have been among the few willing to pay more for the travel perks they offer.

'As Ryanair relentlessly increases capacity and gradually broadens its target markets, the legacy carriers will feel the pain,' said Stephen Furlong, an analyst with Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin.

'They are showing this market is not only the preserve of legacy airlines.'

Ryanair needs to capture more of the business market to achieve its goal of flying 120 million passengers per year by 2022.

It estimates that around 20 million of its 83 million annual passengers are business travellers. To reach the target, it aims to increase that to between 30 million and 36 million.

Rival easyJet, which Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has praised for its success in attracting business travellers, has a 'flexible fare' from £54.99 that also includes 20kg of checked-in baggage, free date changes and fast-track security screening.

Ryanair says there are limits to its transformation and it has no plans to extend free luggage to other fares or to introduce free food or lounge access to business passengers.
