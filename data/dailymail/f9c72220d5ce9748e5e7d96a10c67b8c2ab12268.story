The first Iraqi Peshmerga troops have arrived in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane, where they will assist Kurdish fighters in their battle against rampaging Islamic State militants.

Ten fighters entered the northern Syrian border town this morning after crossing the border from Turkey, with a further 140 reinforcements set to follow in the coming hours.

Clearly worried about the new arrivals, Islamic State militants tried to capture the Mursitpinar crossing overnight, leading to fierce clashes at a border point forming the only way in and out of Kobane.

News that reinforcements have arrived in Kobane came as the president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region said he would be willing to send more Peshmerga troops to the battle-ravaged city if requested, but leaders there told him a small artillery support unit is all they need to drive ISIS out.

Speaking just minutes after the first Peshmerga fighters arrived in Kobane, local activist Mustafa Bani said the reason only 10 men had so far been able to enter the city was because the border crossing they are using to travel from southern Turkey has been targeted by militants from the Islamic State.

The remaining 140 fighters plan to make the incredibly dangerous  200-yard journey from the Turkish border to a Kurdish stronghold inside Kobane over the coming few hours, he added.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the 10 peshmerga fighters entered Kobane around midday local time (9am GMT).

The mission of the peshmerga troops is to help Kurdish fighters inside Kobane try to break the siege by Islamic State militants who first launched an attack on the city six weeks ago.

The ability of the small force to turn the tide of battle will depend on the effectiveness of their weapons and on continued U.S.-led airstrikes against the extremists.

Yesterday, a group of 50 Syrian rebels entered Kobane - also from Turkey - in a push to help Kurdish fighters there against the IS militants. The rebels are from the Free Syrian Army and were meant to help the long-awaited Iraqi peshmerga fighters and the town's Kurdish defenders.

The Free Syrian Army is an umbrella group of mainstream rebels fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The political leadership of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army is based in Turkey, where fighters often seek respite from battle. 

Despite dozens of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, the Kurdish fighters in Syria - known as the People's Protection Units or YPG - have been struggling to defend Kobane against ISIS since mid-September.

The jihadis offensive on Kobane and nearby villages has killed more than 800 people, activists say. 

The Sunni extremists captured dozens of Kurdish villages and still control parts of Kobani. More than 200,000 residents of the embattled Syrian city have fled into southern Turkey since fighting began.

The American and Arab coalition has carried out more than 150 airstrikes against militants in and around Kobane since the first bombing raids were carried out in September

U.S. officials said the airstrikes have killed hundreds of ISIS fighters, helping to stall their advances.

Under pressure to take greater action against ISIS - both from the West and from Kurds in Turkey and Syria - the Turkish government recently agreed to let the fighters cross through its territory.

But it only is allowing the peshmerga forces from Iraq, with whom it has a good relationship, and not those from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK.

Ankara views Syrian Kurds defending Kobane as loyal to what it regards as an extension of the PKK. 

That group has waged a 30-year insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and NATO.

Kurdish fighters in Syria have repeatedly said they did not need more fighters, only weapons. 

They distrust Turkey's intentions, accusing it of blocking assistance to the Kobane defenders for weeks before giving in to pressure and shifting its stance.

Many suspect Ankara is trying to dilute YPG influence in Kobane by sending in the peshmerga and the Turkey-backed FSA.
