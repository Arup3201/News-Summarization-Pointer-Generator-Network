Truly sick: Sandy Nguyen, 28, is accused of falsely claiming her son had terminal cancer in order to con her Colorado community out of an estimated $25,000

A Colorado woman is charged with the unimaginable crime of convincing her 6-year-old son, along with her entire community, that he had terminal cancer in order to scam thousands in charitable donations.

Police announced Friday the arrest of Sandy Nguyen, 28, of Arapahoe County on charges she accepted $25,000 in donations using the appalling lie.

There were even times the boy, and everyone else, believed he'd gone into remission and once when Nguyen allegedly said the 'he probably only had 8 more months with them.'

'We don't have any reason to believe 
that anyone other than her knew the truth,' Arapahoe County Sheriff's 
Captain Larry Etheridge told KMGH. 'The little boy believed he had 
cancer. The rest of the family believed he had cancer.'

September
 2012 is when police say Nguyen started falsely telling members of her 
community that the boy had been diagnosed the previous April with 'an 
aggressive, rare, stage 3 childhood bone cancer and Acute Myelogenous 
Leukemia.'

A 5K charity walk
 was even held for the boy. A website for the event says the boy had 
'received 317 days of chemotherapy, 7 days of radiation, multiple blood 
& platelet transfusions, monthly spinal taps, biopsies, and MRI's.'

Sad: Police say the family even went to Disneyland on the donations. They believe only Nguyen knew the truth after she duped her family, the school and community and even the boy into thinking he had cancer

Astonishly,
 the event's tickets were sold out and local businesses, in addition to 
individuals, had contributed to a fund for the boy.

The event's page notes that the boy was 'fighting cancer for the 3rd time.'

It was the following June when Nguyen allegedly told people the boy had just months to live.

Photos from Nguyen's Facebook page show a boy both with hair and at times with a bald head, as if he's endured chemotherapy.

There are also photos of the family during a visit to Disneyland. The Facebook page was taken down after Nguyen's arrest.

'Over the last several months, Ms. Nguyen accepted at least $16,000.00 from that account, as well as a trip to Disneyland for herself and family, which was paid for by the donated funds,' officials told KMGH.

Astonishing: The boy's elementary school and community even held a 5K charity walk in the boy's name. They created an account for the family and place $25,000 in it. Police have since reclaimed about $23,000 in cash from the family home

According to the school and sheriff's office and the boy's school, a total of $25,000 was raised and put into an account for the family.

Rolling Hills Elementary School Principal Darla Thompson informed parents of the situation in a letter on Friday.

She wrote:

'We are deeply troubled by these allegations and saddened to learn that an adult may have taken advantage of an innocent child and our school community,

'It is important for our community to continue to show support and compassion for this child, who is also a victim in this case. The child was wrongfully led to believe that he was ill, and he was not responsible for the parentâ€™s alleged actions.'

On Thursday, Arapahoe County Sheriff's investigators executed a search warrant at Nguyen's home, recovering about $23,000 in cash.

Nguyen has since posted $10,000 bond and has been released from jail.
