Guide dog owners are scared of going out in London because of cyclists, a charity has said.

There has been an increase in reports of those involved in a collision or a near-miss with someone on their bike, according to the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.

Research by the charity found that almost half of visually impaired people had been involved in a crash with a cyclist and three quarters who came close to it were due to people cycling on pavements or ignoring red lights at pedestrian crossings.

Guide Dogs for the Blind Association found blind people are scared to go out in London because of cyclists

Rob Harris, from the association, said: ‘We work incredibly hard to get blind or partially sighted people out of their homes and mobile, so to hear that vision impaired people are anxious and in some cases fearful about going out in London because of irresponsible cyclists is very worrying.

‘With the Mayor committing nearly £913 million to a “cycling revolution” we need to make sure that cyclists are more aware of blind and partially sighted pedestrians.’

Partially sighted guide dog owner Deborah Persaud from Islington, Greater London was walking home from a tube station when she was hit by a bicycle.

She said: ‘I was halfway along the road when I was struck by a cyclist coming towards me on the pavement. My dress was torn, the contents of my handbag damaged and I was left with damage to my shoulder and hip.’

Working in partnership with Transport for London and the London Cycling Campaign, Guide Dogs has launched the Cycleyes campaign, which says that every cyclist has a ‘duty of care to look out for other road user’.

Charlie Lloyd, campaigns officer for the London Cycling Campaign, said: ‘Any crash or a close pass which frightens or intimidates a pedestrian is unacceptable. Far worse when that person is blind, partially sighted or in any was less able than we are.’

The survey found cyclists had been riding on pavements or ignoring red lights at crossings, causing collisions

Leon Daniels, Transport for London's managing director for Surface Transport, said: ‘It is vital on London's busy road network that we all understand and respect the needs and welfare of our fellow road users.

‘We support the Guide Dogs' campaign to remind cyclists and other road users to watch out for and give extra care to visually impaired and other vulnerable pedestrians.

‘This, together with the work being done to make pedestrian crossings more accessible with tactile paving and audible signals, will make London's roads safer for all.’

The campaign calls on riders to use their eyes ‘for those who can’t’ – by reminding them to use a bell or call out when they can see guide dog owners waiting to cross the road.

It also asked cyclists not to ride up behind a guide dog in case it startled or confused them and dismount bikes if they need to go on the pavement for any reason.

The results of the charity’s survey came from 33 of the 320 guide dog owners in London, where over 41,000 people are registered blind or partially sighted.

And of those questioned, 14 said they had been involved in a collision and 25 had been in a near-miss.
