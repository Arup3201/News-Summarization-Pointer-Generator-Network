An illegal immigrant who has cost the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds since arriving in the UK has won £600 in compensation for 'unlawful detention', it has been revealed. 

Sri Lankan-born Kamalan Ganesharajah has spent the last 22 years lying to immigration authorities about his identity in an attempt to remain in the UK, the High Court heard. 

Despite this, and his 35 criminal convictions, including one for handling stolen property, Ganesharajah has been awarded hundreds of pounds in compensation.

Sri Lankan-born Kamalan Ganesharajah was detained on remand at HMP Wormwood Scrubs, pictured, in 2008 because of his persistent re-offending and was deemed a 'harm to the public good'

Ganesharajah first entered the UK in October 1991 when he tried to claim asylum, which was refused in February 1993.

He made repeated appeals to remain in the country and was granted a string of temporary 'extensions of leave' until  he was ordered out of Britain in May 2004.

Ganesharajah lied repeatedly to immigration authorities about his criminal convictions, nationality, name and age frustrating the deportation system, the High Court heard. 

His case was flagged up to the authorities after it came to light that he had clocked up 35 convictions for 63 offences between August 1997 and June 2008. They included obtaining property by deception and handling stolen goods.

In May 2008, Ganesharajah, whose age is not known, was detained on remand at HMP Wormwood Scrubs because of his persistent re-offending and was deemed a 'harm to the public good'.

He spent the next four-and-a-half years at various immigration removal centres before finally being put on a flight to Sri Lanka on February 28 2013 - 22 years after first arriving in the UK.

During his time in jail he repeatedly lied about where he was from, what his name was and how he came to the UK and mounted a 'deliberate campaign of misinformation and deception', the High Court heard.

Despite this he was awarded £600 in compensation for being illegally detained after he made a claim against the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

Last month the High Court of Justice ruled that although the majority of his time in jail or in an immigration removal centre was 'lawful', his first five days in jail were 'unlawful' as he had not been 'served a notice of detention' within the correct time period.

Bobbie Cheema QC, sitting as Deputy High Court Judge, noted Ganesharajah's 'appalling criminal record', but stated: 'The first five days were unlawful in that no notice (of detention) had been served - substantial damages of £500 are awarded.'

The ruling was revealed today. The court also ruled the following seven weeks in jail were 'unlawful' and awarded a further £100 of 'nominal damages'. 

According to court documents, Ganesharajah was sent to Dover Immigration Removal Centre (DIRC), and in August 2008 a detention review on his case stated: 'Mr Ganesharajah has shown a propensity to re-offend and as such can be considered a harm to the public good.' 

Various other 'detention reviews' stated that Ganesharajah should not be released as he was 'non-compliant' and had a 'high propensity to re-offend'.

Prison chiefs stated that he should not be released until Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) were issued by the Sri Lankan High Commission so he could be deported.

Ganesharajah lied repeatedly to immigration authorities about his criminal convictions, nationality, name and age frustrating the deportation system, the High Court, pictured, heard.

Ganesharajah, however, told officials he 'did not want to go back to Sri Lanka' and refused to cooperate with the ETD process and in January 2010 threatened a member of staff at DIRC and got into a fight with another illegal immigrant.

During his time on detention Ganesharajah put in an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, saying he was being unlawfully detained.

Jonathan Nancekivell-Smith, a Director at the Home Office, wrote in 2010 that Ganesharajah had 'multiple identities' and if released was at risk of 'absconding' and committing more crimes.

Ganesharajah was told that his appeal to the European Court of Human Rights was not a 'high priority' for the court and was told there was a 'backlog of 30 years' for cases.

In July 2010, a case worker stated: 'He informed me he would rather stay in detention or prison that go home.'

He told the case worker Sri Lanka was a 'foreign country to him' and that he would rather go to India, where he claimed to have an uncle.

He also claimed his real name was Amit Sohail and that he was an Indian Muslim and that he could only speak Hindi, not Tamil, a language of Sri Lanka - but refused to be fingerprinted so Indian authorities could check.

He also claimed to be from the Maldives, saying he had relatives there.

He was due to be flown out of the UK on August 28 2011, but didn't get on the flight because of red tape over his identity - with the same thing happening again on September 28 2011. 

In another meeting with immigration officials in November 2012, Ganesharajah said he was 'unsure of his nationality' and claimed that he was a child when he arrived in the UK in 1991.

A report stated that Ganesharajah had 'frustrated' the deportation process by 'switching his nationality from one to another'.

He was finally put on a flight to Sri Lanka on February 28 2013 - 22 years after arriving in the UK - after telling the authorities 'he was prepared to move to any country in order to be released from detention'.

A source, who works in immigration and speaking on condition on anonymity, said today: 'Day in, day out we deal with cases like this where we have to jump through hoops and bow down to legal loopholes which prevent us from deporting people.

'It's got to the stage where we are banging our heads against a brick wall and in the end this guy gets a £600 payout from the British taxpayer. It would be funny if it wasn't so ridiculous.'

He added: 'The time he has spent in prison and detention centres will have cost upwards of £250,000.

'I dare not think how much the court cases, legal challenges, cancelled chartered flights and all the paperwork have cost in the past 20-odd years, but it's safe to say it will be substantially more than £1m.'
