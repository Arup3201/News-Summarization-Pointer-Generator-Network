Juan Cuadrado gave a glimpse of why Chelsea are desperate to sign him during Fiorentina's 3-1 Italian Cup win over Atlanata on Wednesday. 

Chelsea have had a £20.6million bid rejected for the winger, with Fiorentina insisting they will not accept bids below the £26.8m release clause in the Colombian's contract.

The clubs are expected to hold further discussions over the next 24 hours.

And Cuadrado proved why Jose Mourinho wants to bring him to Stamford Bridge by stepping up and slotting home a penalty in the 12th minute of a comfortable win for Fiorentina. 

Fiorentina boss Vincenzo Montella, however, said denied that Cuadrado would leave: 'To date, there is no chance that Cuadrado leaves Fiorentina. He knows that some things are exaggerated.' 

Montella's side were 3-0 up inside 30 minutes with striker Mario Gomez netting twice.

Gomez, who has been struggling with injury and form, had only scored once in the previous 10 months. 

But he got Fiorentina off to the perfect start with a deflected shot in the sixth minute.

Cuadrado doubled Fiorentina's lead from the spot six minutes later after Guglielmo Stendardo was harshly adjudged to have fouled Gomez, sparking fierce Atalanta protests.

Gomez added Fiorentina's third in the 28th minute before Rolando Bianchi scored a consolation goal just before half time with a curler into the bottom right corner.

Fiorentina defender Marcos Alonso was sent off in the 84th after two bookings in three minutes.

Fioretina will now face Roma in the quarter-final after Rudi Garcia's side beat Empoli 2-1 on Tuesday.
