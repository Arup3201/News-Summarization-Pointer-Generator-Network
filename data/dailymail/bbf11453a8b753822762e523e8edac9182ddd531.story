A prison governor has been suspended for allegedly pushing a union official and swearing at him on a picket line staged by his jail's staff.

Jim Bourke, governor of Swaleside prison in Kent, is on temporary leave while senior Prison Service officials investigate the incident.

Witnesses claim Mr Bourke – a former prison officer – drove his car on the wrong side of the road before stopping near a group of 250 protesters.

They were workers from three prisons within the 'Sheppey Cluster' –  Swaleside, Elmley and Standford Hill  – angry about cuts to pensions and part of a national public service workers' walkout on May 10.

It is alleged that Mr Bourke grabbed and pushed Malcolm Young, a branch official of the Public and Commercial Services Union, swore at him and said: 'Get out of the way.'

Earlier, Mr Bourke is said to have phoned Kent police, who sent two officers in a van to investigate his claims that the pickets were causing an obstruction outside the prison.

The officers concluded that no offence had been committed and decided to take no action.

Later, after a second call from the jail, Kent Police Chief Inspector Peter de Lozey went to the scene. After talking to pickets, he also decided against any action.

Sources said last night that Mr Bourke had denied pushing anyone or swearing.

A Kent Police spokesman said last night: 'People have the right to take part in organised and peaceful protests.

'The police facilitate this and will take action only if this right to protest is abused.'

A spokesman for the union said: 'Our members were taking part in a lawful picket as part of a national strike.

'They were horrified by what they saw and we will provide any assistance we can to the investigation.'

A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: 'Following an incident during industrial action, the Governor of HMP Swaleside is on temporary leave while an investigation is conducted.'
