They tend to make their beds in the hollow of a tree. But these baby raccoons seem quite happy to keep an eye out for Davy Crockett types from the safety of this road grate in the Big City.

The trio were spotted poking their heads over the drain by motorist Anthony Richards in California when he stopped at traffic lights.

Raccoons have increasingly made their way into towns and cities in the U.S. since the 1950s, but urban raccoon populations are frequently underestimated because people seldom see them during the day as they are nocturnal.

According to the department of Animal Care and Control for the County of Los Angeles, raccoons are attracted to urban areas by the easy accessibility of food, water and shelter.

They may be cute but they can damage buildings, gardens, fruit trees, lawns and bins and carry carry diseases and parasites.

As well as in hollow trees, raccoons make their dens in drainpipes, homes, apartment buildings, under decks and in storage buildings.
