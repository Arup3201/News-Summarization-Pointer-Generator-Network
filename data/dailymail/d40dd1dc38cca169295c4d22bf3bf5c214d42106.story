First year students arriving at Oxford and Cambridge for undergraduate degrees have been told to attend a lecture on sexual consent before beginning classes, it has emerged. 

A series of 30 minute workshops at Cambridge will be included in Freshers' Week itinerary in a bid to get newcomers talking about the difference between consensual and non-consensual sex, while Oxford is holding classes in 20 of its colleges. 

At the end of the sessions, an official will read out a statement which describes consent as 'active and willing'.

It comes after police dropped an investigation into a former Oxford Union president who was accused of rape. 

Ben Sullivan was arrested last year after being accused of sexually assaulting a student. 

The 21-year-old was released after being held in a police cell for 12 hours without charge, then six weeks later told no further action was going to be taken.  

Amelia Horgan, one of those organising the workshops at Cambridge, told the Guardian: 'We are sending out a very clear message with these workshops that sexual violence is not welcome within the university community.' 

No students will be forced to attend, though organisers say the sessions will be useful as there is a lack of sex education in schools.

Classes at Cambridge University (Trinity College is pictured) will also be included in the Fresher's Week itinerary 

'A lot of people come to university with a very, very basic sex education which stems from sheer biology,' said Caitlin Tickell from Oxford University's women's campaign. 

Staff at Oxford are also drawing up a campus-wide anti-harassment policy after reviewing the existing rules. 

It comes after an apparent spread in lad culture which has increased poor treatment of female students by men in sports teams and societies.
