Manchester United midfielder Nick Powell is in discussions over a loan move to Bolton.

The 20-year-old has failed to make an impression this season on loan at Leicester City, who will cut short the deal.

Powell had previously enjoyed a profitable loan spell at Wigan, playing in the Europa League 

Powell has made four appearances this season, including one for United in their Capital One Cup defeat to MK Dons, and Louis van Gaal wants him to have more game time.

Bolton boss Neil Lennon wants Powell to provide the legs for veterans Emile Heskey and Eidur Gudjohnsen, and cover for the injured Max Clayton.
