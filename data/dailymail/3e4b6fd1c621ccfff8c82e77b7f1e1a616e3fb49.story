An independent Scotland would be blocked from joining the European Union if Alex Salmond ploughs ahead with his 'bonkers idea' of using the pound, it emerged tonight.

Brussels chief Olli Rehn warned it 'would simply not be possible' to become an EU nation if Edinburgh did not have control of its own currency.

Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the revelation meant an independent Scotland would have to choose between 'using the pound like Panama uses the dollar, or joining the EU'.

Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro until July this year, warned it 'would simply not be possible' to become an EU nation if Edinburgh did not have control of its own currency

In his letter to Treasury minister Danny Alexander, Mr Rehn said a country wanting to join the EU would need to have an independent central bank and the 'will and expected capacity' to join the euro

Doubts about the currency Scotland would use if it leaves the UK have dominated the debate ahead of the independence referendum on September 18.

Mr Salmond has insisted it would continue to use the pound, entering a currency union with the remaining countries in the Union.

But Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems have all ruled out the plan, making it impossible whoever wins next year's Westminister general election.

In a speech tonight Mr Alexander released details of a letter from Mr Rehn, who spent a decade as a European Commissioner, including four years as European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro until July this year.

Mr Rehn insisted that any country which wants to join the EU must be 'committed' to the Economic and Monetary Union of the EU.

It means they must have the 'will and expected capacity to meet the convergence criteria of euro membership in due course' as well as their own independent central bank.

But if Scotland is using the pound governed from London, it will not have control of bits own currency.

Mr Rehn added: 'As to the question whether 'sterlingisation' were compatible with EU membership, the answer is that this would simply not be possible, since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its own and thus no necessary instruments of the EMU.'

Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the revelation meant an independent Scotland would have to choose between 'using the pound like Panama uses the dollar, or joining the EU' 

The revelation from a senior Eurocrat will be seized on by opponents of independence as proof Scotland would be cut adrift from Europe if Mr Salmond goes it alone.

In a speech to Chatham House this evening on Scotland's place in the world, Mr Alexander said: 'No country has ever joined the EU while using only the currency of another country at the point of accession.

'Today we learn that that option is incompatible with EU Membership.

'So an independent Scotland would face a simple choice – using the pound like Panama uses the dollar, or joining the EU.

'It can't have both. This shows yet again the nationalists failure to put forward a credible currency plan and the dangers it poses to the people of Scotland.'

First Minister Alex Salmond, on a visit to the Eden Brewery in Guardbridge, near St Andrews in Fife, said the latest polls were 'very encouraging'

The latest YouGov poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the No campaign ahead of the independence referendum on September 18

The Yes campaign is now just six points behind in the battle for independence, suggesting Alex Salmond has the momentum

It marks an escalation in the bitter row over the future of the Scottish currency, with Mr Salmond toasting a 'very encouraging' opinion poll which shows the gap between the Yes and No campaigns has narrowed to just six points.

Support for the Yes vote has surged following the First Minister's triumph in last week's TV debate against former Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign.

The YouGov survey for The Times and The Sun showed 48 per cent plan to vote No, 42 per cent back the Yes campaign and 10 per cent remain undecided.
