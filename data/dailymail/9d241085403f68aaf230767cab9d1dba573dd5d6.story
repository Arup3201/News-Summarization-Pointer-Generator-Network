A pensioner fought off three raiders with her walking stick after they stormed into her home and threatened her ill husband.

Margaret Holding, 66, who lives with her seriously ill husband Reginald, 72, was forced to act when the gang entered her home in Tern Hill, Shropshire, on Tuesday.

The raiders told the pensioner they had seen a man run into the couple's semi-detached property and they were trying to catch him.

But Mrs Holding didn't believe their story and threatened the gang with her stick until they left.

Margaret Holding, 66, threatened a gang of three that stormed her home with her stick until they ran away

Mr Holding, a retired plumber, who suffers from heart, kidney and lung problems as well as diabetes, was upstairs at the time and phoned the police from the bedroom.

After Mrs Holding forced two of the men out of the back door, she then pursued a third raider who ran upstairs and started rifling through the couple's bedroom.

The retired hotel manager again used her stick to force the man out of her house.

All three of the gang fled the house empty-handed. Another man who was acting as a look-out in the garden also ran away.

The gang entered the woman's home through a back door and said they'd seen a man running into the house

Mrs Holding said: 'We had left the back door open as our nephew might have popped in but when we heard a noise and called out there was no answer.

'When we went out to the hall we saw the men, it was really scary. I saw one of the men go upstairs so up I went with the walking stick.

'They were trying to claim someone was hiding under the bed or behind the wardrobe but I said "that’s impossible". I said: "Get out now, get out now before I hit you".

'He was saying: "don’t hit me, don’t hit me, don’t hit me", and I was saying: "I’m going to hit you, I’m going to hit you, I’m going to hit you".

Margaret Holding, pictured with her ill husband Reginald, 72, said she is convinced the gang would have hurt the couple if she didn't act

'I didn’t want to hit him because I was worried what the other would do to my husband, otherwise I would definitely have hit him.

'The men were very threatening and I am convinced if I hadn’t done anything they would have hurt myself and my husband.

'He then went downstairs and I went into another room, where another one was, and I told him to get him out. I threatened to hit him too. I should have hit him.

'Luckily they left through the back door, they seemed quite frightened.

'I attacked the men to protect my poorly husband, who needs oxygen 15 hours a day. I was more concerned about him because he’s not in good health.

'I’d do it again if they came back. We were both really shook up afterwards.

Police are now hunting the men - described as white and in their early 20s

'It was frightening at the time because everything is happening so quickly. I just wanted them out and I got them out.

'They could have turned nasty. But right now I just feel angry, angry that they have been in my house.'

West Mercia Police are hunting three men who are described as white and in their early 20s. Two are thought to have Irish accents. All were wearing dark clothing.

A force spokesman said: 'Thankfully, when the elderly woman picked up her walking stick and asked the three men to leave they all decided to take note of her warnings and flee the scene.

'The three men ran back out of the rear door where it seems a fourth man had been waiting for them. The men all then made off on foot and were not seen again.

'The elderly couple - who although shocked did not suffer any physical injuries as a result of this incident - immediately called the police and an investigation was launched.'
