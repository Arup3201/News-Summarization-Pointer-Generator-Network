Two large men who stole cameras worth several thousands of dollars smuggled them out of Walmart in their rolls of fat.

Police in Purcell, Oklahoma said the men had keys to the cabinet which held the cameras and knew where to stand to avoid being recorded on security footage while they hid the electronics about their persons.

Video shows the men scouring the aisles and concentrating on the locked cabinet for nearly 15 minutes.

Big boys: Police say these two men snuck the cameras out of Walmart using their girth

Suspicious: The men scouted the cabinet for a good 15 minutes before returning with a backpack and a trolley

They returned to the area with a shopping trolley and a backpack as they worked out a way of obtaining the cameras which range from $40 to $2,000.

Police detective Scott Stephens said: 
'They get them in a backpack and take them to an area that is not 
observable by cameras. They take them out of the packages.

'They
left the packaging and the backpack there and went out of the store, 
through the checkout line. They did pay for some smaller items.'

Stephens
continued: 'Both of the gentlemen were large so they apparently 
concealed the cameras somewhere on their bodies but because they were so
large, it was difficult to see how they did it.'

The men focused on the more expensive cameras and store security found the empty boxes after the pair left Walmart.

The two men have not been identified or apprehended as of yet.

Sneaky: The men knew just where to stand to avoid being properly captured by the security footage

Investigation: Police detective Scott Stephens said the men ended up paying for some smaller items while escaping with the electronics
