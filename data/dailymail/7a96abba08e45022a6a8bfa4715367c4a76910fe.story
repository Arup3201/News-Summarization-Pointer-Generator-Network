Difficult: Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, said: 'This is still a very difficult time for Royal Mail'

Stamps are 'incredible' value for money -
even after next week's price rise of at least 30 per cent, Royal Mail's
chief executive said today.

Moya Greene defended the steep hike in cost - up from 46p to 60p for first class and 36p to 50p for second class - saying they would still be half the price of posting letters in France.

The prices were some of the lowest in Europe and had not kept pace with inflation, and the core business was still losing money, she said.

The announcement of the huge increase, the biggest since 1975, prompted a stampede, with one customer ordering 10,000 second-class as panic buying spread. Royal Mail even rationed stamps, prompting growing anger.

However, Ms Greene - whose total pay for her first nine months, including her salary, 
bonus (of £142,000), benefits and pension, was reported last year to be £777,611 - told the annual conference of the Communication Workers Union that the company faces a 'spiral of decline' unless conditions are imposed on competitors planning to deliver post.

Ms Greene voiced strong concerns about the impact of unregulated competition, which the Royal Mail believes poses a huge risk to the six-day-a-week, one-price-goes-anywhere universal service.

She became the first Royal Mail chief executive to address the annual conference, warning that competition for so-called end-to-end deliveries is an 'immediate threat'.

Rival firm TNT has launched a trial delivery service in west London following a previous trial in Liverpool, saying it wanted to roll out a broader service.

Ms Greene told today's conference in Bournemouth: 'I am fearful that competition, if it does not have conditions imposed, will soon begin a spiral of decline in Royal Mail that will be very difficult to staunch.'

She warned the union that Royal Mail faced 'hard years' ahead, highlighting fears that if firms were able to compete in the more profitable parts of the business, other parts would become more expensive to service.

Ms Greene said Royal Mail had become an 'easy target' for criticism as she urged people to stop treating the company as a 'spectator sport'.

She told delegates that when she took over from previous chief executive Adam Crozier 21 months ago, Royal Mail was effectively bankrupt and had to operate under a regulatory regime under which there was 'no way' it could be successful.

The firm was cash negative, pensions were in jeopardy and officials were telling her it could run out of cash within four months.

'It was scary,' she said, detailing some of the changes that have been made in recent years, including the loss of 5,400 jobs last year, taking the total to 50,000 in the past decade.

'This is still a very difficult time for Royal Mail. This is a great company which has struggled for over a decade from chronic under-investment.'

Ms Greene added that at a time of 'economic turmoil' in the country, with fewer letters being posted, it was 'amazing' that the regulatory regime was allowing increases in the capacity for sorting post.

In a question and answer session later, Ms Greene faced anger over the planned privatisation of Royal Mail, with one delegate saying private firms would only be interested in profits, rather than quality of service or the pay and conditions of workers.

Ms Greene said Royal Mail needed a lot of capital in the next five years and questioned the success of the company being owned by the Government.

'I am not sure that Government ownership has been as great as you think it might have been,' she said, pointing out the level of job losses and regulatory regime she believes has held back the company.

She added that many parts of the Government do not even use Royal Mail.

Government ownership was not a panacea for future success, she told delegates, continuing: 'If we do not beat the competitors, we will not be successful, regardless of who owns the company.

'We need profits to continue to have good, secure employment and all the technology we need to be a successful company.'

 'It's
clear that the more delivery work which is done by private companies, 
the less there will be for Royal Mail, and core services could suffer 
with higher prices and lower service standards.

'We
don't want a race to the bottom in the postal industry - we want 
secure, quality jobs with recognised trade union representation.

'Competition
and privatisation bring uncertainty for everyone in the industry, as 
the pursuit of profit comes before services to the public.'

Dave Ward, Communication Workers Union

She was questioned about the threatened closure of a mail centre in Gloucestershire, where 450 workers are based, but replied that she could not give any guarantees because of falling mail volumes.

The amount of mail posted has fallen by 25 per cent in the past five years, with the daily postbag now less than 60 million compared with 84 million in 2006.

Ms Greene received polite applause from delegates to her speech.

Royal Mail has warned that TNT's pilot service underlines the fact that competitors can 'cherry-pick' the most profitable, high population density routes, leaving Royal Mail to deliver to unprofitable areas.

The move also raises the prospect of competitors being allowed to deliver fewer than six days a week, said Royal Mail.

Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: 'TNT's end-to-end deliveries are the obvious next step in postal competition, but we fear this could lead to downgrading of services and jobs across the industry.

'We share many of Royal Mail's concerns about how this will affect the universal service and deliveries for everyone.

'It's clear that the more delivery work which is done by private companies, the less there will be for Royal Mail, and core services could suffer with higher prices and lower service standards.

'We don't want a race to the bottom in the postal industry - we want secure, quality jobs with recognised trade union representation.

'Competition and privatisation bring uncertainty for everyone in the industry, as the pursuit of profit comes before services to the public.'

A TNT spokesman said: 'We want to be part of a UK postal industry that is world-class and people can be proud of.

'There is independent research that has concluded, where competition takes place in end-to-end delivery it has improved the overall performance of the universal service provider.

'TNT Post is committed to creating jobs and providing innovation and quality services in the UK, working within an increasingly competitive postal market, with an increasingly efficient Royal Mail.'
