Indoors he is working around the clock to finish his latest album.

But outdoors, it seems John Mayer wants to get as far away from the studio as possible. 

Just days after Christmas, the 37-year-old singer-songwriter uploaded a picture of his new, luxurious off-road vehicle to Instagram - a purchase believed to have set him back nearly $500,000.

John Mayer posed alongside his $500,000 purchase, the EarthRoamer XV-LTS, just days after Christmas

In the image he is posing alongside his EarthRoamer XV-LTS, a vehicle owned by some of the wealthiest outdoor enthusiasts in America. 

With it he posted the message: 'I am a proud owner of this most formidable go-anywhere, live-anywhere vehicle. One year and many meetings in the making, she’s all mine.

'Completely hand built in Colorado by extremely talented and innovative men and women. Who knows where I’ll end up next.'

The company who manufactures the vehicles, that are custom-built to the owner's requests,  insists they are not RVs and are instead XVs or 'Xpedition Vehicles.'  

Inside are a number of amenities that would make any adventurer feel at home, no matter what terrain they are taking on.

There are various storage cabinets, a bathroom, shower, kitchenette, and seating for up to eight people including the driver.

The luxury off-road vehicle costs between $300,000 and $600,000 and is owned by some of the richest off-road enthusiasts in the the United States 

The bunk above the seating area comes with a king size bed while the kitchen is fitted out with an espresso machine, a sink, a stove and even a spice rack.

Underneath is a F-550 sports four-wheel drive and a potent 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel V8, producing 300 horsepower and 660 lb-ft of torque.

The company's website adds: 'Adventurous people who appreciated good design, engineering and craftsmanship who were frustrated with the limitations and poor quality of traditional RVs immediately embraced the EarthRoamer XV-LT and sales grew rapidly.'

The company insists that they do not manufacture RVs, but instead produce XVs or 'Xpedition vehicles'

The 37-year-old singer-songwriter is currently working on his new album 

Adventurer and nature photographer Bill Swails started the company back in 1998 with the aim of producing a vehicle where the comforts of an RV can be experienced on almost any terrain. 

Before Mayer revealed his new purchase, he had posted a number of images of his adventures around the country. 

The day before he uploaded a picture of road winding through a cactus-strewn desert sayting: 'Off to the next adventure...' 

While travelling he has also found time to work. 

On December 1 he posted: 'Heading back to LA with a head full of songs to write. It was good to get away from the process for a while.'

Shortly after, he said: 'Record is half written, 12 songs, but six that won't come off the track listing. Production starts February. Putting the gang together now.' 

On Wednesday, it was alleged that Celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis had split from her husband of 11 years Todd Thompson amid unfounded claims that she had been having an affair with Mayer. 

The luxurious interior includes a small kitchen with an espresso machine, sink, stove and even a spice rack

There is enough room to fit eight people, including the driver, inside the EarthRoamer 

The models start at $282,000 and depending on the owner's request can reach up to $500,000 

In the spacious kitchen area there is also a fridge and a number of storage units to fit vital camping supplies 

Above the kitchen and seating area is a huge king size bed to make most adventurers feel at home
