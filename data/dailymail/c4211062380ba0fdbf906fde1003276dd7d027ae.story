Nicola Sturgeon today launched her bid to replace Alex Salmond as leader of the SNP, putting on course to be Scotland's first female First Minister.

She is the clear favourite to succeed Mr Salmond, who dramatically quit on Friday after voters rejected his dream of independence in the historic referendum.

Miss Sturgeon said she wants to 'serve my party and my country' and insisted she is the 'best person for the job'.

Nicola Sturgeon today launched her bid to replace Alex Salmond as Scotland's First Minister, with bookies make her almost a dead cert for the job

She used a press conference at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall to announce his bid, insisting Mr Salmond's were big boots to fill

Miss Sturgeon has been Deputy First Minister since the nationalists came to power at Holyrood seven years ago, has been the clear favourite to take over from Mr Salmond.

He announced last Friday that he would be stepping down from the job after Scots voted by 55 per cent to 45 per cent to remain in the Union. He said 'party, Parliament and country would benefit from new leadership'.

Bookies immediately named Miss Sturgeon as the favorite to succeed him.

Today Ms Sturgeon said: 'To be the first minister of my country, especially at this exciting and optimistic time, would be both a great honour - without doubt, the greatest honour - and an immense responsibility.

'I am putting myself forward for two simple reasons: I want to serve my party and my country. And I believe I am the best person for the job.

'I also hope that my candidacy, should it succeed, will send a strong message to every girl and young woman in Scotland: no matter your background or what you want to achieve in life, in Scotland in 2014 there is no glass ceiling on ambition.' 

While Ms Sturgeon paid tribute to Mr Salmond, she was also keen to state: 'I will be my own person and set my own course.

'At risk of stating the obvious, I am not Alex Salmond. His are big boots to fill, but if given the opportunity to lead, I will wear my own shoes - and they will certainly have higher heels!'

Although she said the case for Holyrood having more powers was now 'urgent and irresistible', Ms Sturgeon stressed that if she becomes first minister, 'my responsibility will also be to use those powers we already have to make life better, now, for those we serve'. 

 

As she watched the results of the referendum at the Glasgow count in last week, Miss Sturgeon went from jubilation to reluctant acceptance of defeat

Miss Sturgeon, 44, is a former solicitor and is married to the SNP's chief executive Peter Murrell.

Her almost-certain elevation to the top job raises the prospect of all the main parties in Scotland being led by women.

Ruth Davidson is the Conservative leader north of the border, while Labour's leader is Johann Lamont.

However, there has been speculation in recent days that Miss Lamont will quit after a lacklustre performance during the referendum campaign.

At the party's UK conference in Manchester there are strong rumours that Miss Lamont is 'ready' to quit, although this was slapped down by her supporters.

The party is bracing itself for more in-fighting and soul-searching following last week's referendum.

Former Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy is said to be already being lined up as the next leader.

Miss Sturgeon has been an almost permanent fixture by Mr Salmond's side during his time in government.

In his resignation speech on Friday, Mr Salmond refused to be drawn on supporting a successor, but said 'party, Parliament and country would benefit from new leadership'.

He will quit as First Minister after the SNP conference in Perth on November 15.'

Mr Salmond said that at the age of 59, after 20 years as SNP leader and seven years as First Minister, it was time to hand over the reins. He said it was 'time to give someone else a chance to move that forward'.

Alex Salmond likes a flutter, but he will get terrible odds on his likely successor.

Within minutes of the SNP leader announcing his decision to quit last week, bookies were as good as paying out on his deputy Nicola Sturgeon taking the reins.

She issued an almost comically-worded statement declaring that she could think of 'no greater privilege' than to take the top job, before adding the decision was 'not for today'.

The 44-year-old former solicitor has been by Salmond's side as his deputy for the last decade, forming what Labour's Johann Lamont today admitted was a 'formidable team'.

She is married to the SNP's chief executive Peter Murrell, and with Salmond and spin doctor Kevin Pringle, they were the four party chieftains who guided the party from multiple election defeats to the brink of breaking up the United Kingdom.

Though she does not have children, her frequent appearances at schools and nurseries have helped to soften the blokey image of Salmond's SNP.

William Hill made Miss Sturgeon the 1/3 favourite to take over the SNP leadership. 

Almost out of politeness, the bookies named other possible contenders including Angus Robertson, the SNP's successful election strategist, Alex Neil, the Scottish Health Secretary, and Derek Mackay, a local government minister.

But in the contest to succeed racing fan Salmond, Sturgeon is the frontrunner in a one-horse race.
