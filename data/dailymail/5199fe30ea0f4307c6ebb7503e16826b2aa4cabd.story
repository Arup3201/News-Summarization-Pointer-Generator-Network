This bunny dressed as a sailor may look like an advert for a cartoon but it was in fact part of a serious medical campaign - against sexual transmitted diseases.

Many of these vintage posters come across as crude, sexist and even threatening.

However, in an age without TV and internet they were the first line of defence against diseases like tuberculosis and gonorrhoea.

This poster featuring a rabbit dressed as a sailor was issued in 1946 by the American government to warn navy personnel against unprotected sex. The 'Pro' sign is thought to refer to prophylactics

A grotesque line- up of dictators Benito Mussolini, Hideki Tojo and Adolf Hitler carrying hypodermic needles was used to alarm soldiers over the possibility of catching venereal disease during the Second World War

The threat of the 'Axis' powers of Japan, Italy and Germany during the Second World War was equated with venereal disease in 1940 as the American Government believed it would make their soldiers too weak to fight

Aimed at soldiers returning from the First World War, keeping venereal disease under control was the next big challenge facing the government

The Canadian government warned its soldiers that 'innocent looks' may be 'booby traps'

The collection, which come from across the world, often used sultry women to flag the dangers of venereal diseases and the Angel of Death to symbolise serious ailments.

The devastating effects of polio on children, for example, was represented by Death holding a little girl's legs.

The majority of the campaigns come from the early 1900s when infectious diseases like cholera, influenza and tuberculosis were the great scourges of society.

Governments during the Second World War feared their soldiers would succumb to sexually transmitted diseases as they played away from home

Health posters often featuring sultry women in provocative poses, such as this one published in 1943 by the US government

There were also two world wars which caused massive upheaval and resulted in unsanitary conditions where disease flourished.

Soldiers on the frontline were often the focus of these campaigns.

One First World War poster depicts trench foot as being as much a danger as the enemy troops in the opposing trenches.

The American Government was frightened that all the socialising between locals and soldiers would create an epidemic

The Canadian government also frightened its citizens with the list of symptoms of venereal disease, including sterility and blindness

The French Ministry of Hygiene was fearful in 1930 of syphilis, telling the public: Defend yourself against syphilis

Cholera is a deadly bacteria, causing death from dehydration, so this Soviet poster from 1967 urged citizens to get themselves vaccinated before the grim reaper struck

A frightening campaign from 1943, showed death holding a girl's legs was intended to raise awareness of Polio, or infantile paralysis. Polio epidemics in the early 20th century left thousands paralysed until vaccines were developed in the 1950s and 1960s

Venereal disease was also a major concern and during the First World War an estimated 18,000 US soldiers were treated for sex diseases every day.

Only the great influenza pandemic of 1918-19 accounted for more soldiers taken out of the front line.

So in the early days of the Second World War, the US War Department embarked on a massive propaganda campaign.

This trench foot warning for American soldiers in the Second World War was a reaction to the drastic problems from the First World War in which affected feet would have to be amputated if untreated

A stern warning to 'obey the rules of health' between 1936 and 1941to avoid Tuberculosis, which could be avoided with a proper diet and adequate sleep and sunshine exposure

This poster appeared in the USA in 1918 appealing for help for Serbia. The country had been devastated by the First World War, leaving ideal conditions for a cholera epidemic.

This health warning poster used between 1941 and 1945 issued by the US government's Office of War Information was particularly graphic

This poster was used from 1941 to 1944 as part of the American war effort. Although discovered in 1928 in the UK, penicillin was not mass-produced until 1944, when the USA produced 2.3 million doses in time for the Normandy invasion

It was principally aimed at preventing VD among its millions of male soldiers.

This resulted in a series of bizarre health posters often featuring sultry women in provocative poses accompanied by phrases such as 'She May Look Clean - But...'

However, this 'golden age' of medical posters soon came to an end with the development of antibiotics and vaccines which made infectious diseases more controllable.
