These incredible images of some of the world's most sophisticated aerial warfare technology were taken during today's graduation ceremony for Israeli pilots.

The images, taken at the Hatzerim Air Force Base near the southern city of Beersheba, Israel, provide a rare glimpse into the astonishing air power wielded by the Israeli Air Force, an arm of the Israeli Defence Force (IDF).

The Israeli Air Force was born in the War of Independence in 1948 and has grown from four Czechoslovakian Messerschmitt planes to a vast and technologically sophisticated force.

Might: Israel has a sophisticated and well-trained air force that uses fighter jets, attack helicopters and drone technology

Technology includes the U.S.-built F16I fighter jet and the Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, as well as a vast array of support vehicles and state-of-the-art drone technology.

Israel spends 7.3 per cent of its GDP on its military, making it the country with the sixth highest expenditure in the world.

The graduation ceremony also saw an American-made Israeli McDonnell DouglasÂ F-15I fighter jet launch anti-missile flares, while engaging in aerobatic manoeuvres.

The American McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter that is used by air forces throughout the world.

It is considered among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100 aerial combat victories with no losses in dogfights, according to aviation writer Mike Spick.
