Gerald Malcolm. 48, has been jailed for eight years for raping a woman on the side of the road in broad daylight

A rapist who had to have cold water poured over him by strangers to stop him attacking a woman in broad daylight has been jailed for eight years. 

Gerald Malcolm was attacking a woman so drunk she could not walk or talk on the side of the road when shocked motorists pulled over shortly after 4pm in April. 

A couple poured water over the 48-year-old who had plied the woman with alcohol at a pub near his home in Halesowen, West Midlands, before launching the attack. 

Malcolm, originally from Jamaica, was jailed for eight years at Wolverhampton Crown Court . 

The court heard how he met his 28-year-old victim at a library before convincing her to join him in a pub. 

He then took her back to his home where the woman drank more alcohol and became unwell. After offering to walk her home, he was walking by on the roadside when he launched his attack. 

Speaking after his sentencing the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was so drunk she could barely move or speak. 

'The assault has had a lasting effect on me; I still cannot believe that this man attacked me and I don't know how I got so drunk. 

'It is awful that I cannot remember what happened to me, this was in the street in broad daylight. I would never have done anything like this in the street.

'I keep blaming myself, I keep thinking that this is my own fault because I got so drunk, but he shouldn't have done this to me, he shouldn't have taken advantage of me. 

'I couldn't move and I could barely speak let alone say no or fend off my attacker. I willingly went to his home for a drink but I did not at any point agree to sex, that prospect was not in my mind at all.' 

West Midlands Police said it hoped Malcolm's sentencing would deter other attacks.

Dc Sarah West, from the force’s Public Protection Unit, said: 'Rape is rape and there are no excuses, there is no grey area. 

'Men need to understand that if a woman says no or is incapable of consenting, for instance through drink or drugs, they are committing a criminal offence.

'I hope today’s sentence will help the woman move on with her life knowing the person responsible is behind bars.'
