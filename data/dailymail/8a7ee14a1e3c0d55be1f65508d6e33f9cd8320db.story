Food giant Heinz has been fined £50,000 after an engineer had his right hand sliced off by a potato peeling machine.

Surgeons had to operate eight times on Alec Brackenbury's stump - leaving him unable to drive, work or live normally - after he was maimed during routine maintenance last June.

The 49-year-old's accident sparked a major health and safety investigation at Heinz's Westwick plant in Worstead, Norfolk, one of its five British factories, and he is now suing the firm.

Maimed: Surgeons had to operate on Alec Brackenbury's stump eight times, leaving him only with a rudimentary mechanical claw. Heinz admitted safety breaches and the engineer is now suing the firm

Known as Alf, Mr Brackenbury was servicing the machine when he climbed down to fetch a bolt which he had dropped through the peeler into its slurry pump.

He had switched off the peeler before working, and he thought the pump - which is used to clear away excess peelings - was connected to the same circuit.

But it was not, and the pump began running while the engineer's right hand was inside.

It sliced off his hand at the wrist and left him in hospital for two weeks.

Now he has just a rudimentary mechanical claw.

To make matters worse, Mr Brackenbury's caravan on the Norfolk coast was then washed away by storms in December - leaving him homeless.

An investigation by the Health and 
Safety Executive found the pump and the peeler had appeared to be part 
of the same system, even though they were not.

The HSE also established there was no protective grate to stop the self-employed engineer reaching into the pump.

Food giant: Heinz apologised for the incident

Heinz was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to health and safety breaches yesterday at Norwich Magistrates' Court.

Mr Brackenbury's solicitor Ian Comer 
told MailOnline: 'He's been pursuing a civil claim since the incident 
occurred so hopefully we will now be able to conclude that more quickly.

'The impact of losing his dominant hand has been pretty catastrophic.

'He's a mechanical and electrical engineer and also ran a micro brewery as a sideline, but both of those were physical, dextrous work that needed both his hands.

'He's an active, outdoors type man, not an office computer kind of guy. He's already 49 - what kind of work is he going to be able to find?'

The ketchup, baked beans and soup giant 
was fined £50,000 and ordered to pay 
costs of £9,661.

The firm - which Mr Comer said had co-operated fully throughout - admitted one count of breaching Regulation 11(1) 
of the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998.

After the hearing HSE inspector Tony Brookes said: 'Alf Brackenbury suffered a horrific injury in an incident that was wholly avoidable.

'Mr Brackenbury was put at risk by 
Heinz Ltd's inadequate assessment of risks and lack of effective 
measures to stop access to dangerous parts of equipment.

Doubly unlucky: To make matters even worse, Mr Brackenbury's caravan home was washed away by storms

'Sadly
 in this case Heinz failed to protect Mr Brackenbury while he was 
contracted to carry out maintenance work at their Westwick plant and, as
 a result, he has suffered a life-changing injury.'

A Heinz spokesman said: 'Safety is always our first concern.

'Although
 a safe system for maintenance work was in place, further measures have 
been adopted to ensure that such a regrettable accident could not happen
 again.'
