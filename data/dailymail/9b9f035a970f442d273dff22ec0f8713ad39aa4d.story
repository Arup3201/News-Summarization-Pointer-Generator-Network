English MPs could be given a ‘veto vote’ over laws which do not apply to the rest of the UK under radical constitutional reforms to be published next week.

David Cameron will publish proposals aimed at delivering English votes for English laws and rectifying the growing imbalance with the devolved nations.

Tory sources said the plans would give English MPs a ‘decisive say’ in laws which applied only to their constituents and not to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Among three proposals to be put forward by the Government will be a new ‘veto’ or ‘consent’ option which will mean English MPs have the ‘final say’ on English laws going through the Commons. 

Following a committee stage of English MPs, Bills could then be amended by MPs from the rest of the UK in the Commons. But English MPs would then get a further veto vote before a Bill became law.

And after Ed Miliband had previously called for the issue to be referred to a constitutional committee, Labour yesterday made its first significant step towards accepting some form of English Home Rule.

Shadow ministers Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan backed the idea of an English-only committee for Bills that will not apply elsewhere in the UK, as it would ‘strengthen England’s voice’ at Westminster. However this option lacks the critical final veto.

Labour’s plan was initially suggested by former Commons clerk Sir William McKay in his Government-commissioned report on the issue last year.

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The situation since has moved on now that more powers are being devolved to the Scottish Parliament

But Sir William himself has questioned whether his proposals are still relevant given the further devolution to Scotland following the independence referendum. 

He said they would need a ‘hefty tweak’. A Tory source said Labour had ‘spent months denying there was a problem and then latched on to a plan even its author says is outdated’.

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The situation since the McKay report has moved on now that more powers are being devolved to the Scottish Parliament. 

The case for English votes for English laws can no longer be ignored and must be delivered.

‘And we believe it should happen in tandem with further devolution to Scotland.’

He added that Labour was simply trying to ‘kick this issue into the long grass’.

Details of the Government’s other two proposals were not clear last night.

However Tory backbenchers will be consulted over the plans in the coming weeks, and ministers are negotiating further with Lib Dems to put the final choice to a vote before the General Election.

Last month the Smith Commission set out a new deal for Scotland following its rejection of independence that will see it control income tax, VAT revenues and the introduction of new benefits.
