Anthony Weiner showed no signs of letting up in his bid for mayor on Sunday despite a poll revealing that he has hit a record high for unpopularity among New Yorkers.

Weiner appeared at the annual Dominican Day parade in Manhattan, adding a somewhat maniacal presence to proceedings as he dashed around in a pair of bright red pants while clutching a bullhorn.

At one point, Weiner pulled a face as he grabbed a huge plantain handed to him by a giggling bystander on Sixth Avenue.

The embattled Democrat recently admitted 
to a second 'sexting' scandal after resigning his congressional seat 
over a similar controversy in 2011.

Weiner has set a new record with an 80 per cent unfavorable rating among New Yorkers, according to a Siena College poll this month, revealed Politico.

However any signs that he may have been cowed by the scandal fallout were non-existent on Sunday as the 48-year-old candidate zig-zagged
from one side of the avenue to the other, waving a massive Dominican Republic flag.

He yelled: 'Que viva la Republica 
Dominicana' into his megaphone, evidently hoping to appeal to the crowd 
who make up a substantial portion of New York's voters.

Supporters of the Democrat politician marched stoically behind him holding a banner which read 'Weiner!' in yellow letters.

Anthony Weiner's first campaign ad will begin airing today - a 30-second clip where he looks directly into the camera and vows to fight for regular New Yorkers.

Weiner tells voters that he has been 'focused like a laser beam' on fighting for the middle class and has come up with 125 ideas to make the city better.

He also refers to the 'powerful voices' working against him to become mayor but reminds voters: 'They’ve gotten their way for far too long.'

There is no reference in the short clip to the sexting scandal which has overshadowed Weiner's campaign. 

The politician charged up and down Sixth Avenue in Manhattan in tomato-red pants, a white shirt and sneakers after making a more sombre appearance earlier in the day at Brooklyn churches.

The 32nd annual Dominican Day Parade that featured thumping music, merengue dancing and the mayoral candidates stretched over 15 blocks of Sixth Avenue from 37th Street to 52nd Street and lasted most of the afternoon.

Weiner first appeared at the tail end of the parade, with other Democratic mayoral candidates preceding him, including front-runner Christine Quinn, Bill Thompson, Bill de Blasio and John Liu.

The politicians are all seeking the city's significant vote from Hispanic residents, who represent nearly 30 percent of New York's population.

Quinn was another crowd favorite. Each time the City Council speaker made a bee line for the sidelines, she was smothered in hugs and cheers.

Another sex-scandal embattled 
politician also showed up. Eliot Spitzer, running for city comptroller, 
walked with supporters behind a giant banner with his name in large 
block letters. He also drew cheers, but more muted than Weiner's or 
Quinn's.

At the end of the 
parade, an optimistic Weiner told reporters who had scurried to keep pace: 'I'm 
worried for you, guys. We've got four more years of parades.'

Leading the march was outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg whose third term is up in January.

The primary is September 10 with the general election to follow on November 5.
