Ben Stokes has been recalled by England on Wednesday in a Test squad for the Caribbean which also includes six Yorkshiremen.

England have  named a 16-man party for the three-Test series next month that  includes the Durham all-rounder who was left out of the disastrous World Cup campaign.

Stokes emerged as the most exciting young talent in the English game when he scored a maiden Test century in the third Ashes Test in Perth but then endured a miserable year after breaking his wrist when punching a locker in frustration after being dismissed in Barbados.

His all-round form was so bad that he was left out of the World Cup but England have now decided to bring him back into the fold with fitness concerns over Chris Woakes.

Stokes' uncapped Durham team-mate Mark Wood also travels to St Kitts on April 2 as does Adam Lyth, Adil Rashid, Jonny Bairstow and Liam Plunkett in a squad that reflects Yorkshire’s status as the best county for producing talent. The four Yorkshire players join their more established county colleagues Joe Root and Gary Ballance.

Wood, 25, is an exciting fast bowler whose progress has been restricted by injury but who has impressed outgoing England bowling coach David Saker and the man who may replace him Ottis Gibson.

Lyth has also been rewarded for prolific county form, a more mature Rashid than the man who first toured with England six years ago will travel as all-round spin-bowling back-up and Bairstow pips Kent’s exciting young talent Sam Billings as back-up wicketkeeper.

Jonathan Trott, as first revealed in Sportsmail, returns for the first time since a mental condition later diagnosed as situational anxiety caused him to leave England’s ill-fated last Ashes tour after the first Test in Brisbane.

Stokes' uncapped Durham team-mate Mark Wood also travels with the England squad to St Kitts on April 2

Alastair Cook will return as captain for a three-Test tour that England desperately need to win after being embarrassingly eliminated from the first round of the World Cup.

Ian Bell, wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, Stuart Broad, Chris Jordan and James Anderson all retain their spots from the team that beat India at the Kia Oval in August.   

Peter Moores looks sure to remain in his coaching job for now but cannot afford any slip ups against what will be a West Indies side weakened by the Indian Premier League. Chris Gayle, their best player, is also expected to retire from international cricket after the World Cup.
