A fast-trotting week of a drama, colour and fashion  has crossed the Spring Racing Carnival finish line.

The last race has finished and the final, drunken souls have headed home on the train amid singsong and high spirits. 

Many will have left their heels behind and lost their wages on bad bets, but what memories they have made. 

More than 100,000 punters flocked through the gates and thousands more around the country enjoyed countless lunches, parties and glamorous functions to get in to the spirit of Australia's biggest horse race.  

As the day went on, so did the shenanigans, leaving some punters a little worse for wear.

Setting a dramatic tone, dumped bachelorette Sam Frost arrived at Derby Day ready for some track-side fun, only to run into ex-fiance Blake Garvey in the same marquee. 

The Melbourne woman, who was dumped by the Bachelor Australia star weeks after he proposed on the show, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘I wasn’t expecting to see him, I was shocked.' She's since escaped overseas on a girlie holiday to try and mend her very broken heart. 

Spring Racing Carnival may just be the only event on the globe where glamour and the grotesque crossover.

Apart from the devastatingly tragic deaths of the two Cup horses, Australians would not want the Carnival any other way. 

Here are the top 10 Melbourne Cup Week Carnival moments:

 1. Setting a dramatic tone, dumped bachelorette Sam Frost arrived at Derby Day ready for some track-side fun, only to run into ex-fiance Blake Garvey in the same marquee. Awkward! The Melbourne woman, who was dumped by the Bachelor Australia star weeks after he proposed on the show, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘I wasn’t expecting to see him, I was shocked.' She's since escaped overseas on a girlie holiday to try and mend her very broken heart

2. Who will ever forget Geoffrey Edelsten, clad in a hideous canary yellow shiny silk suit, proposing to his mysteriously odd American girlfriend Gaby Greco infront of the cameras?How very apt that sequinned- adorned Gaby was dressed like a confused bird as she strutted through the Birdcage with huge, feathered horns.'Set the bird free!' laughed the stunned celebs looking down from the plush marquees concerned for her welfare on the arm of pensioner Geoffrey. 

3. Rolling up on Crown Oaks Day, Brynne Edelsten, the blonde bombshell spurned ex of Geoffrey, sashayed into the luxury Emirates marquee declaring she didn't give a hoot about Geoffrey's forthcoming nuptials to Gaby. 'I'm in love!' she screeched. Her lover? A lofty body builder called Big Red Ra. He was busy at home drinking a protein shake or something 

4. Suddenly, everyone downing gallons of vintage Mumm in the Birdcage were reminded that somewhere nearby a pretty famous horse race had taken place - the Melbourne Cup. Word got round that, tragically, the Cup favourite Admire Ratki had collapsed and died from a heart attack after returning to his stable

This news was shortly followed by another top runner Araldo fatally injuring his leg after being spooked by a child waving a flag -spirits were dampened, and for good reason

5. The tragic demise of the two top Cup horses didn't stop Carnival-goers from seeking attention.Model Imogen Anthony, girlfriend of radio DJ and TV star Kyle Sandilands, declared charmingly she didn't 'give a ***t' in the Mumm marquee that her Halloween-inspired leather bra top and bare midriff was against Flemington rules 

6. Battling high-winds, the entire cast of the Real Housewives of Melbourne attempted and failed to cover their fake-tanned assets while walking through the Birdcage lane ways. 

7. While her famous German footballer boyfriend Mario Gotze was celebrating scoring one of the two goals that cemented Bayern Munich’s win against Roma, Ann-Kathrin Brommel couldn't stop smiling in Emirates Marquee as she enjoyed a day out in the Oaks Day sunshine.And despite the distance between the loved-up couple, Mario was certainly never far from the beauty’s mind deck exclusively telling Daily Mail Australia she'd just love for Mario to propose. Ann-Kathrin was a perfect rose amid some rather unpleasant thorns 

Sprawled out, heels missing and dresses torn, teams of security staff had to help them leave Flemington. Their dignity, meanwhile, was left behind 

9. Yet amid the crass there was, thankfully, some class. Hollywood superstar Margot Robbie came home to Australia just in time to lift the tone of the Birdcage on Emirates Stakes Day wearing Ellery and a suspicious smile, as she mingled with her former Neighbours co-stars in Swisse marquee 

10. Let's not forget the most truly impressive moment of the week was a world-class performance from Protectionist, the Melbourne Cup winner of the race that stops a nation, at just his 10th race start. He clocked the fastest winning time since Media puzzle in 2002
