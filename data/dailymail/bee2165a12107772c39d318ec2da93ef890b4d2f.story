An artist made a life-sized replica of Michelangelo's artwork in the Sistine Chapel which is made entirely out of cake and contains 10,000 marshmallows.

The replica of The Creation of Adam also features half a billion cake sprinkles and took 168 hours to complete.

The 18ft 9ins by 9ft 2ins artwork - which was created to mark the 450th anniversary of Michelangelo's death tomorrow - has been dubbed 'The Baking of Adam'.

Cake Angels artist Michelle Wibowo 
said: 'Britain is currently gripped by baking fever with a real emphasis
 on unique designs and showmanship.

'When we learnt of Michelangelo's anniversary celebrations, we really wanted to join in.

'We decided to challenge the boundaries of cake design by immortalising his most heavenly creation in our own special way.

'We used our range of versatile and vibrant sprinkles, proving that even cake can become a fantastic art canvas.'

The edible artwork is currently on display at London's St Pancras Church and is likely to be auctioned off for charity.

It is one of London's most famous 
â€˜artistic churches', with its own gallery. A sculpture of the artist's 
namesake, the archangel Michael, inhabits the church gardens.

The
 artists used computer software to scan the original artwork before 
putting together a 24 different coloured sprinkles to create their 
replica.

A 'glue' made out of icing sugar, butter and vanilla frosting was used to stick the sprinkles down.

Although it is edible, it is unlikely that the cake artwork will ever be carved up and eaten.

Mrs Wibowo, 35,
 added: 'No celebration is complete without cake and we really hope that
 Michelangelo would have given us his official seal of approval.

Real thing: The original Creation of Adam artwork by Michelangelo which is on display in the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City

'The
 real difficulty was matching his exact scale and style but the 
possibilities are endless when you have so many textures and colours to 
choose from.'

The original was commissioned for The Sistine Chapel by Pope Julius II and completed in 1512.

Central to the ceiling decoration are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known.

The famous painting has an iconic standing which some believe is equalled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa portrait.

Five years ago Canadian Joanna Lopianowski-Roberts, 44, unveiled a cross-stitch replica of the artwork.

She spent eight years creating the artwork - which is twice as long as Michelangelo spent working on his original.
