The attack reportedly took place in Qara Tappah, with the first bomber detonating an explosives vest at the gateway to a security compound.

Minutes later, two suicide bombers ploughed explosive-filled cars into the compound. At least 60 people were wounded in the attack, claimed by ISIS.

Sitting: The extremist group has carved out a vast stretch of territory from northern Syria to near Baghdad

The U.S. military said yesterday it launched airstrikes north and west of Baghdad, hitting a small ISIS fighting unit and destroying armed vehicles. It said Britain participated in the airstrikes.

New York-based Human Rights Watch meanwhile said militants from ISIS are holding hundreds of Yazidi captives, including women and children, in detention facilities in Iraq and Syria.

Based on accounts by relatives of detainees, it said the group has systematically separated young women and teenage girls from their families and has forced some of them to marry its fighters.

Hundreds of people from the Yazidi religious minority were killed and tens of thousands were forced to flee for their lives after militants overran their hometown of Sinjar in north-west Iraq in August.

Also today, activists claimed Kurdish fighters have halted ISIS’s advance in the Syrian border town of Kobani, where the U.S.-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes for two weeks.

The Syrian Kurdish enclave has been the scene of heavy fighting since last month, with the heavily armed ISIS fighters trying to capture the border post and deal a blow to the coalition air campaign.

The extremist group has carved out a vast stretch of territory stretching hundreds of miles from northern Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad and imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule.

The fighters have massacred hundreds of captured Iraqi and Syrian soldiers, terrorised religious minorities, and beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers.

Since the offensive on Kobani began, 550 people have been killed, including about 300 ISIS fighters, 225 Kurdish gunmen and 20 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
