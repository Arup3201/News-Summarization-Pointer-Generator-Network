A cold-call firm has been forced to pay compensation to a businessman after he took it to court for wasting his time.

The stunning victory could open the floodgates to further claims from the millions of homeowners plagued by similar unwanted and infuriating calls.

Richard Herman vowed to hit back after he was targeted by firms promising compensation for mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance (PPI).

Victory: Richard Herman at his home Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey invoiced a 'cold caller' for his time and they paid up

The 53-year-old turned the tables by invoicing one of the firms for £10 for every minute he wasted answering their telephone calls.

He also recorded the calls, meaning that when the unscrupulous company denied ever having rung him, he was armed with incontrovertible proof to the contrary.

He offered to send the firm the recordings but they ignored him, so he took his case to the small claims court.

The claim stated: ‘Invoice is for the use of time, phone and electricity for receiving telemarketing communications’.

Richard Herman's Court Claim against PPI Claimline

In a victory for the little man, marketing company AAC, which sells referrals to claims management companies, agreed to pay the full £195 for 19-and-a-half minutes of calls, plus a £25 court fee.

Yesterday, Mr Herman said: ‘I was feeling oppressed that I was getting called by these companies. Once I sent the company the invoice, I felt as though the boot was on the other foot. I wasn’t the victim any more.’

He is urging others targeted by cold-callers to follow his example.

The nuisance calls – often using a pre-recorded voice message to set out an initial sales pitch – try to convince you that they can secure thousands of pounds in refunds of PPI, insurance supposed to cover debts if you fall ill or cannot work.

The county court has a ‘small claims track’ to handle claims for less than £5,000, or £1,000 for personal injury or housing disrepair. The process is designed to be cheap and quick and should not require a solicitor.

1) When it’s worth making a claimBefore you make a small claim you need to show you have given the other party a clear opportunity to pay up. Write a letter saying how much they owe and what for, and a warning that you will make a court claim if you do not receive the money beyond a reasonable deadline. It is worth seeking advice from a Citizen’s Advice Bureau or law centre before starting your action.

2) How to get the ball rollingIf the debtor does not respond in time, you can submit your small claims forms. These are available online – search for form ‘N1’ at hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk – and cost £25 for claims up to £300, rising to £100 for claims up to £5,000. If you are successful in your claim, the other party will be liable for this fee.

3) What next?The defendant has two weeks to respond to the court. Hopefully they will not contest the case and pay up. But if they do, the court will allocate a hearing date, which often takes months.

4) In courtThe two parties present their cases to a judge. Your main aim is to prove the debt exists. You can take a ‘lay representative’ to speak on your behalf – it could be a relative or a friend. But if you decide to hire a solicitor you will probably have to foot the bill yourself – even if you win.

They try to get hold of your personal details then pass them on to greedy claims-management companies desperate to grab a share of a £9billion compensation pot made available after Britain’s banks were found to have routinely mis-sold PPI.

The claims firms typically pocket a third of the compensation paid out. This means they stand to make £80million this year from a record 165,000 complaints about PPI.

Mr Herman, of Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, said: ‘They told me I had had a £3,500 loan with Halifax which was astonishing to me because I had never had an account with Halifax.’

He described the disruption caused to him and wife Ruth, 67, as they rushed to answer the phone so as not to miss a chat with friends or their three grown-up children.

Mr Herman said: ‘Once I was out in the garden eating and picking raspberries and had the telephone with me in case the children called. I was sat in the sun enjoying myself but one of these blasted companies called me – it was infuriating.

‘We’re all busy rushing around all day long, so when we snatch four minutes by ourselves for a bit of peace and quiet, the last thing you want is to be intruded upon by these irrelevant companies.’

His annoyance was doubled because he was registered on the Telephone Preference Service, intended to block nuisance calls.

So the next time Mr Herman was harassed on behalf of the same claims management company, PPI Claimline, he said: ‘I’m fed up with you calling me. If you call me again I’ll charge you £10 a minute for my time.’

He recalled: ‘I hoped and presumed that that would be the end of it, naturally. But to my astonishment, a couple of days later, they called me again.’ Mr Herman, who owns call-recording company Retell Recorders, sent PPI Claimline an invoice for £195 but the company denied it or any marketing company acting on its behalf had called him.

But as he had recorded the calls, Mr Herman had proof. Marketing firm AAC, which made the call on PPI’s behalf, settled Mr Herman’s claim on September 14 before the case appeared before a judge.

Yesterday PPI Claimline said: ‘PPI Claimline and its suppliers only contact people who have opted in to such approaches. We have audited the details regarding the calls to Mr Herman and have found that he had indeed consented to be contacted.

‘We would like to draw a clear line between the two calls to Mr Herman made on behalf of PPI Claimline and any other calls he received, which were nothing to do with PPI Claimline or its suppliers.’

Mr Herman has now set up a website – www.saynotocoldcalls.com – to help other victims, and is appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Money Box programme at midday today.
