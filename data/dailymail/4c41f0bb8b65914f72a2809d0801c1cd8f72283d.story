A WWF legend who once wrestled headliners like Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant is now a double amputee living in poverty in rural Mississippi.

Now all James Harris, who rose to fame as Kamala the Ugandan Giant in the 1980s, has left from those days as a pro wrestler on the national stage are his memories.

And with his continued optimism in the face of nightly dialysis, a tragic family story and mounting bills to pay, Harris hopes to put those memories down on paper in an autobiography called Kamala Speaks.

Rise and fall: James Harris, aka Kamara the Ugandan Giant, once wrestled WWF headliners like Hulk Hogan, but has since lost his legs to diabetes and is living in rural Mississippi in poverty

Named ironically, since his cannibalistic character spoke only in grunts in the ring, the tome is the focus of a Kickstarter donation drive.

After all, as Harris recently told Bleacher Report, 'Life is worth living.'

But that doesn't mean there hasn't been heartache.

The Mississippi native lost a parent at the tender age of 4 when his father was killed during a game of dice.

To date, he's also lost his sister to murder, a son to AIDS and his mother.

it appeared that Harris, who recalls sometimes having nothing to eat but discarded bones from the butcher as a child, was going to skirt what looks a lot like a family curse when he was discovered by the WWF in 1982.

Kamala was actually a 6-foot-7 Mississippi native, but he terrified audiences as an 'Idi Amin-inspired' African cannibal who often took on legends like Andre the Giant in the 1980s and the Undertaker in the 1990s. His character didn't speak and was accompanied by a keeper named Kim Chee (left)

Harris saw great success in the pro wrestling world, but says he was paid only a tiny fraction of his banner name opponents

He quickly rose to fame as the silent, shirtless cannibal from afar--whose 6-foot-7 frame and girthy build struck fear in children and adults alike--accompanied by a man named Kim Chee.

That man, whose real name is Kenny Casanova, is the mind behind his Kickstarter and book.

Casanova believes Harris--who has a 9th grade education--lost out the soaring salaries of WWF headliners like Hogan and the Undertaker and is now paying the price.

'If I had been a better talker, if I'd have known how to negotiate, that probably would've helped me,' Harris told Bleacher Report.

Today, Harris lives on a meager government check following the loss of both his legs to years of diabetes. And his wife has recently been laid off from her job of nearly 30 years. 

'I figured Kamala's story alone in book form could be one answer to lost earnings,' Casanova writes on the Kickstarter page. If written correctly, it could mean great supplemental income for Kamala for years to come. So, I picked up the phone and made the call.' 

Kamala speaks: In order to right what he sees as a wrong, Kim Chee AKA Kenny Casanova, decided to try to help Harris earn a few bucks by telling his unbelievable life story in a biography

Old friends: 'Many HUGE wrestling names came together to provide quotes, stories and additional content for this project, to help create an autobiography like you have never read before,' Casanove writes in his Kickstarter page for the biography project

Today, the book is done and--like Harris himself--tries to focus on the positive.

The biography of Harris focuses on, according to Casanova's Kickstarter page:

And, as Harris says: 

'Don't feel sorry for me, If you want to, encourage me. Embrace me. I'm going to be all right—just like I've always been.'
