They live in one of the most hostile places on Earth, where the ground is littered with black volcanic rocks and daytime temperatures regularly soar to 45 degrees Celsius.

But for the people of the Turkana tribe, this lunar landscape is home. More than two days drive from Kenyan capital Nairobi and bordered by South Sudan to the north and Ethiopia to the east, 250,000 people eke out a living from their cattle on the shores of the mighty Lake Turkana.

Yet despite living in one of the remotest and most inhospitable places on the planet, photographer Eric Lafforgue, the man behind these incredible images, says the people are welcoming - and have a fascinating array of traditions, not least their habit of celebrating the passage to adulthood with a liberal application of dung.

Striking: A Turkana woman shows off her beaded collar. The red colour of her skin comes from a mix of ochre, butter and perfume which is used instead of water to bath

Beads: All women wear beads, with men refusing to look at them if they fail to do so. They never take them off unless they're ill or in mourning for a relative

Beautiful: Both men and women wear the Turkana's trademark nakaparaparal or earrings, which are made exclusively by the men using aluminium

Important: For Turkana men, ostrich feathers are a sign of adulthood and are thus hugely expensive - two ostrich feathers are worth the same as a goat to the tribe

'To become a man, a Turkana teenager 
must go through a ceremony where he has to kill an animal with a spear 
in one throw,' explains Lafforgue. 'Once done, the elders will open the 
stomach of the animal and smear all the dung on his body - it's their 
way of blessing him.'

And 
the Turkana tribe's uses for poo aren't limited to initiation rites. 
With little wood to be found, most of the cooking is done over fires 
made from dried cow dung, while dog poo is used both as a medicine and 
as a lubricant to keep the tribe's elaborate bead necklaces from chafing
 the neck.

'Women put 
animal fat all around their neck and also on their huge necklaces to 
prevent skin irritation,' reveals Lafforgue. 'They also use dog poo as a
 medicine and as a lubricant for their necks.'

But
 it's animal fat that holds the most value for the Turkana, who along 
with using it as both food and medicine, also use it as a substitute for
 water when it comes to keeping clean.

Protective: Women of the Turkana tribe use 
animal fat mixed with ochre to protect their skin and use either animal 
fat or dog poo to stop their necklaces from chafing

Adults:
 Women are considered adults as soon as they hit puberty but boys have 
to go through an initiation ritual before they are considered men

Family affair: Fathers give children different jobs depending on their age with boys in charge of herding while girls do things like collecting firewood and water

Initiation rite: Boys of the Turkana tribe aren't considered men until they have killed an animal with a single spear throw, after which dung is smeared over their bodies

'Since
 water is so rare, it’s used only for drinking and never for washing,' says Lafforgue. 'Instead, the 
Turkana clean themselves by rubbing fat or butter all over their skin.

'Turkana 
women follow it up with grease paint which they make by mixing animal 
fat with red ochre and fragrant leaves from one of the local trees. They 
say it's good for the skin and it protects them from the insects.'

Teeth, meanwhile, are cared for using 
twigs from the esekon tree. 'You see them using it all day long,' adds 
Lafforgue. 'The Turkana people have 
the cleanest bill of dental health in the country.'

Although
 the Turkana prize their esekon trees and impressively large herds of 
sheep and cattle, wealth is revealed via elaborate beaded jewellery 
which the tribe value above everything else.

'Turkana women love to adorn 
themselves with a lot of necklaces,' says Lafforgue. 'Beads can be made from glass, seeds, 
cowry shells or iron. They don't remove their necklaces unless they are ill or mourning a relative - they even sleep in them.

'Married
 women will also wear a plain metal 
ring around the neck, which has the same function as a wedding ring. So 
important are necklaces to the Turkana, a man will do all he can to make
 sure that his womenfolk are 
dressed in impressive beads.

cut through their lower lips while all men wear the elaborate emedot 
hairstyle which is made using clay (right)

Elaborate: Turkana women all wear beaded necklaces - women who don't are shunned as 'being like animals' by the men of the tribe

Painful:
 All Turkana people have their lower incisors removed in childhood - a 
practice thought to have begun as a way to make nursing people with TB 
easier

Clean teeth: The Turkana use the esekon stick to
 clean their teeth (left). Lower incisors, however, are removed in 
childhood using the corodat finger hook (right)

'Even
 if they can't afford to send their girls
 to school, they will still ensure that they have beads because the 
quantity
 and style of jewelry a woman wears reveals her social status. In 
particular, a woman without beads is bad and men will ignore her - they 
say "you look like an animal without beads".'

But jewellery isn't only for the women. Men too wear elaborate decorations, most famously, their nakaparaparaI or ear ornaments, which are made by the men of the tribe from aluminium.

'Men have elaborate
 mudpack hairdos called emedot which is a kind of chignon,' adds Lafforgue. 'It takes the shape of a large bun of hair at the back of the head and they 
decorate it with ostrich feathers to show they are elders or warriors.

'Tattoos
are also common and usually have a special meaning,' he continues. 'Men are tattooed on the
 shoulders and upper arm each time they kill an enemy — the right 
shoulder for killing a man, the left for a woman.'

More gruesomely, the Turkana tribe still cling to their tradition of knocking out the lower incisors - a practice usually done in childhood using a fearsome-looking finger hook called a corogat.

'Originally, it was supposed to protect people against tetanus because they can feed people with milk through the hole when they're lock-jawed. It also means the lower teeth don't interfere with the 
labrets many put on the lower lip.'

Sadly, the Turkana, who have lived in their remote home for millennia, could be under threat after oil was discovered underneath their land. 'Many in Kenya are worried that the Turkana will lose their traditions,' says Lafforgue.

'I'm not sure they will though. The 
Turkana have succeeded in maintaining their way of life for centuries. 
Against all the odds, they manage to raise livestock in the 
desert. Their knowledge allows them to live where most humans could not.'

Threatened:
 Because oil has been discovered on Turkana land, many are worried that 
their way of life and traditions could come under threat

Man's
 best friend: Because of their many dogs, echinococcus is common among 
the Turkana. But they say the disease is caused by a spell cast by the 
Toposa tribe

Remote:
 The Turkana live in an inhospitable part of northern Kenya, bordered by
 South Sudan to the north and Ethiopia to the east

Lunar
 landscape: The Turkana - and their neighbours, the El-Molo - live in an
 area dotted with volcanic rocks and where daytime temperatures climb to
 45 degrees

Home:
 Most Turkana live in small dwellings made from wood, animal skins and 
palm leaves that they call an 'awl'. Inside the homes live a man, his 
wives and children
