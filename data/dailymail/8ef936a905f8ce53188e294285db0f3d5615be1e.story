Fifteen dehydrated migrants were found huddled in the back of a refrigerated lorry in the British countryside yesterday. 

Police stopped the HGV  after they received reports of noises coming from the back.

The shivering migrants, who included women and a 15-year-old boy, told officers they were from Eritrea and Kashmir.

A man has been arrested on suspicion of people smuggling after a lorry containing 15 immigrants - including a 15-year-old boy - from Eritrea and Kashmir suffering from dehydration were found at a service station in Ilminster. One of the stowaways leaves the lorry

Police arrived at the service station off the A303 in Ilminster at 1pm today where they made the discovery

It came just four days after 35 stowaways were found inside a sealed shipping container in an  Essex dockyard. 

In
 the latest case, the migrants are thought to have boarded the lorry 
somewhere between Belgium and Calais. They then spent at least eight 
hours in temperatures as low as 2C (37F) next to pharmaceutical goods 
bound for Devon.

A German 
man believed to be the driver was arrested after the lorry was 
intercepted in Ilminster, Somerset, at around 1pm. He was quizzed on 
suspicion of facilitating the unlawful entry of people into the UK.

The
 lorry, which belonged to the international refrigerated transportation 
company Thermotraffic, has been seized. Avon and Somerset Police said 
the migrants had been checked by paramedics and there were ‘no ongoing 
concerns’ over their health.

Meanwhile,
 a suspected people trafficker was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter
 yesterday over the death of one of the 35 Afghan Sikhs found at Tilbury
 Docks on Saturday.

Police stopped the 34-year-old man just after midday in Banbridge, Northern Ireland.

He
 is being questioned in connection with the death of Meet Singh Kapoor, 
who died inside the sealed shipping container during a terrifying 
journey on a cargo ferry.

The lorry driver, who was in his late 30s, was held on suspicion of facilitating the unlawful entry of people into the UK

Police swooped on the HGV at Southfield Services in Ilminster, Somerset around 1pm after worried callers reported noises coming from the back of the vehicle

The
 suspect is also said to have helped the Afghans illegally enter the UK 
by stowing them inside the ‘metal coffin’ for 18 hours. Police are 
searching his home in County Londonderry, and are due to send him to the
 mainland for further questioning.

The
 Afghans were slowly suffocating when staff at the port freed them after
 hearing screams and banging coming from inside the container.

By
 then, 40-year-old Mr Kapoor had already died as his wife and their two 
sons – aged nine and 12 – slept nearby. The survivors were said to be 20
 minutes from death when they were found, and were ‘drifting in and out 
of consciousness’. 

One of 
them, a man in his 30s, told the Daily Mail: ‘The world can only imagine
 what we’ve been through. Our minds are blank. We have had to go over 
and over our ordeal in interviews with the Home Office.’

Some of the group could speak English and were thought to have been on the refrigerated lorry for 'several hours'

The group were thought to be suffering from dehydration and were examined by paramedics at the scene

Meanwhile
 it emerged that one Afghan mother had to resuscitate her five-year-old 
son who had stopped breathing in the airless metal box. 

The
 woman ‘desperately pounded at his chest’ said Kamaljit Singh Matharu, 
who heard her harrowing account while acting as a translator for the 
police. He added that the mother and her boy were ‘physically well but 
mentally traumatised by their ordeal’.

Mr
 Matharu, 46, said the survivors  had also told him how they tried to 
save Mr Kapoor by pounding his chest while others shouted at him to stay
 awake. And he described how the 35 stowaways were forced to breathe  
through one tiny hole in the sealed container as the smugglers had not 
created enough ventilation for them.

He added: ‘They told me they left for England six months ago, travelling through Europe by truck.‘They
 said they remember stopping in Iran, Turkey and Greece. They said they 
survived on food brought for them by the lorry driver.

The group, which included men, women and a 15-year-old boy, were treated by paramedics at the scene for possible dehydration

Avon and Somerset Police has confirmed medical support and supplies have been provided and it is now working with the local authority to manage their ongoing welfare needs

Police sniffer dogs were also sent to the scene. Those in the lorry are now in the care of the local authority

Those in the lorry have been given food and water and have been taken to place of safety where police are speaking to them. They are believed to be from Kashmir and Eritrea and they can speak English

'But
 sometimes they would have to stop in very remote areas where there was 
no access to food. They would have to survive on a pack of biscuits 
given to them by the driver which they would share between the 
children.’ 

The Afghan 
stowaways, who included 13 children, arrived at Tilbury on a P&O 
ferry from the Belgium port of Zeebrugge on Saturday morning. Some of 
the survivors, whose  ages range from one to 72, were so dehydrated that
 they had to be lifted out by police.

Mr
 Kapoor’s wife Jagtar Kaur and sons Mandeep and Aman are staying with 
family in Feltham, west London. Last night, a relative said the family 
was too distraught to comment.

The other survivors are staying either with relatives or in emergency accommodation across Britain.

They are all applying for asylum in the UK.

The lorry, owned by international freight company Thermotraffic, was heading in the direction of Devon after arriving in the UK earlier today from Calais
