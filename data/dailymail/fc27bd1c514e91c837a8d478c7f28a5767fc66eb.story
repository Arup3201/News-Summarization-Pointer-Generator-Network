Britain’s economy has grown more quickly  than previously thought since the Coalition took power, official figures revealed this morning.

In the four years since 2010  the economy has grown by 8.1 per cent – 1.1 per cent more than the original estimate, according to the Office for National Statistics.

It means the economy is now 2.7 per cent bigger than it was before the economic crash in 2007. 

Overall, Britain has enjoyed the third best economic growth in the G7 since 2010 – more than France and Germany, but still behind the US and Canada.

Chancellor George Osborne this morning welcomed the revised economic figures showing Britain's economy was bigger than first thought

The ONS has changed the way it measures the size of the economy - showing that the recession was not as bad as first thought

This morning’s figures, released by the ONS after it changed the way it measures the size of the economy, also showed that the economic crash was not as bad as first thought.

The Chancellor George Osborne said it was a ‘double dose of good economic news’.

He Tweeted: ‘UK GDP growth in 2011 & 2012 revised up –UK has now grown 8.1% under this Government, up from 7.0% & faster than France & Germany.’

The Treasury now believe the UK economy passed its pre-crisis peak between July and September last year.

It was previously thought that the economy only got back to where it was in 2007 earlier this year.

The economy is now 2.7 per cent above the pre-recession peak – compared to the 0.2 per cent previously thought.

Despite this positive news the recession in 2008 remains the deepest since records began in 1948.

Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said the economic recovery is not being felt by ordinary families

The economic crash saw the economy shrink by 6 per cent – less than the 7.2 per cent previously thought.

ONS chief economist Joe Grice said: ‘Despite the wide ranging improvements underpinning the new estimates, the broad picture of the economy has not changed much.

‘Although the downturn was less deep than previously estimated and subsequent growth stronger, it remains the case that the UK experienced the deepest recession since ONS records began in 1948 and the subsequent recovery has been unusually slow.’

It comes after the latest report from the World Economic Forum lifted the UK one place to ninth in its international competitive ratings.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘These ONS revisions show an economy that has been growing more strongly than previously thought, with almost every quarter under this government being revised upward.’

But Chris Leslie, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, commenting on Office for National Statistics changes to the National Accounts, said: These accounting changes to the way GDP is measured - for instance to include drug dealing and prostitution - do not mean families or businesses are better off.

'GDP growth has been revised up in every year since 2008. But it’s still the case that working people are substantially worse off under this government, that the recovery was choked off in 2010 and that it is the slowest on record.

'Working people want a plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis they still face, not complacent claims from Ministers that everything is fixed or that accounting changes mean we’re somehow better off.'
