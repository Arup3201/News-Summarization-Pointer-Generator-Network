A California man was charged with murder on Friday after authorities said he shot and killed his dementia-stricken wife at their home and his sister in a convalescent home.

Lance Anderson, 60, faces two counts of murder, with special circumstance allegations of multiple murders and intentional discharge of a firearm with great bodily injury. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.

Anderson was being held without bail.

Murder charges: Lance Anderson is arraigned at Los Angeles Superior San Fernando Court in San Fernando, California on Friday, December 13

Coroner's Lieutenant Larry Dietz 
identified Anderson's wife as 68-year-old Bertha Maxine Anderson. She 
died of a gunshot wound to the head after the shooting earlier this week
in the couple's suburban Santa Clarita home.

Shot dead: Lisa Florence Nave, sister of Lance Anderson, had been cared for at a nursing home for the past five years before her brother allegedly shot her in a 'mercy killing'

Authorities
said Lance Anderson took a taxi on Wednesday from the home to the 
Country Villa Sheraton nursing facility in the North Hills area, where 
his 58-year-old sister, Lisa Nave, was shot in the head in her hospital 
bed.

Anderson then
put the small-caliber revolver on a night stand and stepped into a 
courtyard, where he surrendered after police arrived, Los Angeles police
Lieutenant Paul Vernon said.

Police
initially said Nave was in a vegetative state or coma at the nursing 
home for the past five years, but Vernon said she was actually 
responsive and had been improving since a heart attack five years 
earlier left her in a yearlong coma.

After learning of Nave's death, 
family members called Los Angeles County deputies and asked them to 
check on the welfare of Anderson's wife.

Deputies
found Bertha Anderson's body at the couple's three-bedroom town house 
on a curved, tree-lined street in Canyon Country. Sheriff's Lieutenant 
Holly Francisco said no weapon was found.

Family
members told authorities that Bertha Anderson was suffering from 
dementia, said Vernon, who characterized the shootings as apparent mercy
killings.

'He unilaterally
decided to kill two people for whatever seemed like a rational reason 
to him,' Vernon said. 'But it isn't right for those who want those 
people to live. He can't make that decision.'

Neighbors
described Lance Anderson as a chatty, friendly man who doted on his 
frail wife. He had indicated that he had moved from Arizona five or six 
months earlier because of his wife's health.

'He treated her like she was a jewel... because she was so fragile,' neighbor Gale Madrigal said.

Sometimes Lance Anderson was seen on their porch caressing his wife's hand, Madrigal said.

Two
weeks ago, Anderson offered Madrigal his artificial Christmas tree, 
telling her the couple wouldn't be doing anything for Christmas this 
year.

'I want people to understand that this man did not randomly walk into a hospital to commit this crime,' Lieutenant Paul Vernon said.

A resident, David Chabolla, said the gunshot sounded like a balloon popping.

He saw Mr Anderson sitting in the nursing home's courtyard with his head down before police arrested him on suspicion of murder.

A small-caliber handgun was recovered, police said.

Mr Anderson remained jailed.

After hearing about the killing, concerned family members contacted authorities and asked them to check on his wife's welfare.

Her body was found Wednesday morning in the couple's three-bedroom townhouse on a leafy, curving street in the Canyon Country area of Santa Clarita, a northern Los Angeles County suburb.

She had been shot with the gun found at the nursing home, a sheriff's statement said.

It wasn't immediately clear if Mr Anderson had a lawyer who could comment on the case.

Mr Anderson was 'the sweetest guy you could ever imagine,' neighbor Grace Madrigal said, holding back tears.

Mr Anderson and his wife moved into their home about five or six months ago, neighbors said.

Mr Anderson 'was introducing himself to anybody that was going into the driveway' of the townhouse complex, Madrigal recalled.

Apparent mercy killings: Police investigating the shootings have characterized them as mercy killings

Anderson said the couple had come from Arizona because of his wife's health. While he often left in the mornings, she was more reclusive, exchanging a few words while smoking or drinking coffee on the couple's balcony, Madrigal said.

'He treated her like she was a jewel ... because she was so fragile' and was sometimes seen on the balcony with her, caressing her hand, Madrigal said.

Kristen and Lee Booker said Anderson offered them food and help moving furniture after fire damaged their home in September.

Another neighbor recalled Anderson fixing her flat tire.

Two weeks ago, Mr Anderson offered Madrigal his artificial Christmas tree.

He told Madrigal that the couple wouldn't be doing anything for Christmas this year, she said.
