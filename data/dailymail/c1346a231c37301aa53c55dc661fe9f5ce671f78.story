A student who blew a .341 blood alcohol reading after running onto a football field during a game then live tweeted being arrested from her cell has today shown remorse for her actions and revealed she sank into a depression after it.

University of Iowa student Samantha Lynne Goudie, 22, became known as 'Vodka Samm' - her Twitter handle - and gained notoriety after she posted: 'Just went to jail #yolo' and 'I'm going to get .341 tattooed on me because it is so epic' to her followers after the incident.

She then retweeted anyone on the social networking site who praised her and criticized her 'haters'.

University of Iowa student Samantha Lynne Goudie, 22, became known as 'Vodka Samm' and gained notoriety after she posted: 'Just went to jail #yolo'

Boasts: Her drunken antics would have largely passed unnoticed were it not for the fact that Goudie kept friends, family - and the rest of the world - posted throughout the evening with a series of regular updates

But she spoke out this week to reveal that her party girl persona was all a front for deeper problems and said the whole episode was 'devastating' and 'embarrassing'.

The incident last month started when she was watching the clash between Northern Illinois and Iowa at Kinnick Stadium, when she decided to leap over the barrier and run onto the field.

Match stewards pounced and handed her over to police who took her to the station and offered her a breathalyzer test. It was after she was arrested that the Twitter storm started.

As her boasts began to circulate across Twitter, users attacked her for her shameless boasts, unleashing a torrent of abuse.

One wrote: '@Vodka_samm Doesn't have to use birth control because nothing can live in that much alcohol.'

Incredibly, Goudie proudly retweeted that message.

Still unperturbed, the thick-skinned student responded: 'I've gotten so many hate tweets because I was drunk...uh I get good grades sorry for being like every other college student'.Â 

She said: 'I didn't come to college to drink and be "Vodka Samm". I was completely embarrassed by the whole situation. I care about my life'

Samms parents said it was tough to watch their daughter go through everything, but said they are proud of how she has handled the whole situation

Not long after, Samantha abruptly went silent, deleted her account and disappeared from social media completely.

In an interview with The Daily Iowan she said: 'I didn't come to college to drink and be "Vodka Samm". I was completely embarrassed by the whole situation.

'I care about my life, I could have taken this and ran with it and been Vodka Samm my entire life but that's not why I came to college.'

She said the whole ordeal brought 
back her depression which she has struggled with throughout her life. At
one time she also suffered from anorexia and had to be admitted to a 
hospital for treatment.

'I felt like a failure for so long. I
couldn't eat,' she said. 'I still struggle with my issues. But I see 
light at the end of the tunnel. Some days I don't, but I'm getting 
there.'

Proud: But as her boasts began to circulate across Twitter, users attacked her for her shameless boasts, unleashing a torrent of abuse

Thick-skinned: But despite the abuse, the thick-skinned student remained defiant

After she graduates in May, she wants
to go into social work to help other people struggling with 
disabilities and other challenges.

Her parents said it was tough to 
watch their daughter go through everything, but said they are proud of 
how she has handled the whole situation.

Her police report read: 'Goudie, Samantha Lynne, 22 of Iowa City, IA for Public Intox at Kinnick 
Stadium at 1321 hours. Goudie was stopped for trying to enter the field.
Goudie was unsteady on her feet. Goudie blew .341 PBT.'
