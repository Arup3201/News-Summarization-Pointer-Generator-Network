'Sadist': Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, an undocumented immigrant from Poland, pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of animal cruelty in the brutal torture of a small pit bull puppy

An undocumented immigrant from Poland pleaded not guilty this morning in Quincy, Massachusetts, to 11 counts of animal cruelty for allegedly torturing a tiny pit bull dubbed 'Puppy Doe' and leaving her for dead in August. 

A judge ordered Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, held on $500,000 bail pending a November 21 pretrail hearing.

Prosecutors said Czerkawski obtained the dog free of charge on Craigslist and spent weeks brutally abusing her before dumping the tormented puppy in a Quincy park. The pet later had to be put down due to the severity of her injuries.

The 1-to-2-year-old pooch reportedly was stabbed in the eye, burned, had her limbs pulled from the joints and had her tongue sliced in half like a serpent.

'I just want to know so bad why he did it. Why her, of all dogs? What did she ever do to him to make him want to hurt her so bad? She loved everybody,' Puppy Doe's former owner Laura Hankins told the Boston Herald.

Investigators said they found Puppy Doe's blood in the second-floor Quincy residence where the 32-year-old illegal immigrant was living.

According to prosecutors, Czerkawski worked as a home attendant, caring for a 95-year-old Polish dementia patient woman in Quincy, Boston Herald reported.

Police say Czerkaswki left Puppy Doe in the park a day after his client passed away. Her death certificate stated that the woman died from 'failure to thrive' caused by her illness.

Authorities do not believe that Czerkaswki had anything to do with the woman’s passing.

Unholy act: Czerkawski is suspected of stealing 11 checks worth $6,000 from St. Lawrence the Martyr Church in New Bedford, Ma., in April 2012

When asked during a press conference 
Tuesday about a motive behind the sadistic animal abuse, Quincy Police 
Chief Paul Keenan said: ‘Who has a motive for something like this? He's 
probably just a sick individual.’

Following
 Czerkaswki’s arrest in New Britain, Connecticut, Sunday, police in New 
Bedford, Massachusetts, announced that the 32-year-old was a suspect in 
the theft of $6,000 from a local church, South Coast Today said.

Czerkawski is accused of stealing and cashing 11 checks from St Lawrence the Martyr Church, where he had stayed between January and April 2012 after telling the pastor there that he wanted to become a priest. 

A month after the 32-year-old man left for Canada, the church noticed that three of its accounts were missing a total of $6,000.

Czerkawski, a native of Hrubieszow, Poland, has been staying in the U.S. on a tourist visa that expired last month, according to The Patriot Ledger.

Besides the charges in the Puppy Doe case, which carry a five-year prison term each, he is expected to face 11 counts of larceny by check over $250 and a single count of larceny in a building in connection to the New Bedford case.

Caught: Radoslaw Czerkawski is being held on a fugitive from justice charge in New Britain, Connecticut. Police in Massachusetts believe he could be involved with the dog abuse case

The 32-year-old suspect was found at a La Quinta hotel last Wednesday morning, police said, and appeared in New Britain Superior Court Monday to start the rendition process back to Massachusetts.

The charges against Czerkawski is the first significant break in the two-month investigation into the animal cruelty case that sparked outrage among dog lovers from coast to coast.

During Czerkawski's arraignment Tuesday, animal activists filled the Quincy courtroom to support Puppy Doe. Outraged dog owners and their four-legged friends also waited outside the courthouse.

'She didn’t deserve what she got. We’re definitely here with our puppies to support her,' dog owner Kelly Duncan told WBZ NewsRadio 1030.

Cruel: This two-year-old pit bull was found with horrific injuries

Cops
 have spent weeks following the trail of people who have owned the dog, 
which had been given away at least once on Craigslist’s animal-adoption 
pages by a woman who owned the dog last year.

Police
 and much of the public have been on the hunt for the suspect since the 
female pit bull was found on August 31st close to a local playground.

Quincy,
 Massachusetts Police, the Animal Rescue League of Boston and the Office
 of the District Attorney for the Norfolk District in Massachusetts have
 been investigating.

Abused: Puppy Doe weighed only 18lb and had been stabbed, burned and tortured

'Please
 be assured that these three agencies are working in concert to identify
 and hold accountable the person or persons responsible for the torture 
of Puppy Doe. It is highly unlikely that this level of sadistic cruelty 
could be shown to one animal and not be part of a pattern involving 
other animals or perhaps vulnerable people' Norfolk District Attorney 
Michael Morrissey said in a statement.

The two-year-old dog, found near a 
Massachusetts play park, had been beaten, burned, starved and stabbed in
 the eyes in what was described as 'medieval' torture

Animal
 rescue workers described the injuries inflicted on the pit bull, 
including a crude split to give it a forked serpent tongue, as the worst
 they had ever seen.

Veterinarians
 at the Animal Rescue League of Boston who treated the dog said that she
 was emaciated and weighed half of what would be expected for a two year
 old.

Sweet natured: Despite having broken bones, crushed vertebrae and other injuries, the pit bull was friendly

The dog’s tongue had been split on 
purpose. She had also been burned on the nose, stabbed in the eye, and 
beaten so severely that she could barely walk. The pit bull had to be 
put down due to the extent of her injuries.

When she was first found it was thought that she had been hit by a car, but the true nature of her injuries soon came to light.

Vet
 Martha Smith-Blackmore was so shocked by the extent of the abuse that 
she had to walk away and give herself a break as she examined the dog's 
body.

'Her joints were pulled apart like medieval times,' she said. 'She was beaten, stabbed, burned over weeks to months and maybe her whole life. And could not walk.'

The
 vet added: 'When I saw how vulnerable she was and I understood 
immediately the duration of her suffering, my heart collapsed.'

Torture: The dog's limbs had been repeatedly pulled apart

Public outrage saw a number of tips come flooding in to help the Quincy police department in tracking the perpetrator, along with thousands of dollars that had been set aside for a reward.

The Animal Rescue League of Boston offered $5,000, followed by the California-based Animal Legal Defense League put up $2,000. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals offered up another $5,000, and Second Chance Rescue out of New York raised $11,000 for information.

The Animal Rescue League raised also raised $35,000 additionally to be put toward the investigation of this and other animal abuse cases.

The story has prompted Facebook groups that have become the sites of a tremendous outpouring of outrage and grief, and resulted in a vigil held for 'Puppy Doe.'

In pain: The dog had suffered such extensive abuse that she had to be put to sleep

Horrified: Vet Martha Blackmore-Smith says she was heart broken by the extent of abuse the dog suffered

Although there was no evidence of 
sexual interference, which the vet said can be seen in such abuse cases,
 the dog's joints had been separated from being pulled apart repeatedly.

Despite the pain and 
suffering Puppy Doe had clearly experienced in her short life, staff at 
the rescue center said she was sweet natured.

'Within
 hours of being found she had pain medication, food and love. She 
experienced some tenderness and some care at the end of her life,' Dr 
Smith-Blackmore said, adding that the dog's injuries were so severe she 
would have always been in pain if she hadn't been put down.

As well as the burn and stab marks, the dog's vertebrae had been smashed from being hit by a baseball bat or board.
