From clocks with no hands to clown faces and masks, gangsters are known for tattooing their bodies with strange symbols charting their criminal exploits.

While many of them may appear innocent enough to a law abiding citizen, to fellow mobsters they can have an much more sinister meaning.

For example, an opaque teardrop can denote a murder, while the outline of a tear with a clear centre means the wearer is seeking revenge for a killing.

Gangland tattoos can have various meanings, from teardrops for a killing to spiderwebs for jail time. Prosecutors in the case of Aaron Hernandez are examining inkings on his right arm to use as evidence of guilt in two homicides

Clowns and face masks represent gangsters' 'play now, pay later' attitude to life, while spider webs and clocks without hands tell others they have done jail time.

Sometimes the designs are less figurative. In 2011 Anthony Garcia was convicted of murder and sentenced to 65 years in prison after a homicide investigator discovered he had the scene of an unsolved 2004 murder inked on his chest.

Prosecutors in the case of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez are also looking to use tattoos he has on his right arm as evidence against him in a double homicide case.

Officers won't say which designs they are interested in, but Photos of Hernandez show he has had five stars and other tattoo work added to his right forearm over the past few years.

While many star tattoos have nothing to do with crime, they can sometimes be used to represent killings, said Kevin Waters, a criminal justice professor at Northern Michigan University and former agent with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.

While most designs are figurative, others are not. In 2011 Anthony Garcia was locked up for 65 years after a homicide detective noticed an inking of an unsolved murder scene on his chest

A judge in the case of Jeffrey Chapman ruled that he could wear a high-necked jumper to hide the word 'murder' spelled backwards across his neck in case it prejudiced the jury

'I would say the cops probably see the stars and know in some circles that a star does represent a kill and want a tattoo artist to come in and see if he (Hernandez) said anything about that,' Waters said.

Sinister designs have also caused problems for criminals facing trial, including William Clyde Gibson, a convicted double murderer who tattooed 'Death Row x3' on his head before a third homicide trial.

Teardrops: Have several possible meanings, including the number of people the wearer killed or the number of stints in prison they served.

A clear teardrop can mean the wearer wants revenge for the killing of a loved one.

Spider webs/Clocks with no hands: Can mean the wearer served time in prison.

Stars: They can be innocent designs. On some prison gang members, however, they can represent the number of people the wearer killed.

The number of points on a star can correspond with the number of years served in prison.

Three dots: Often inked near an eye or on a hand, it can refer to the "vida loca," or crazy life, of a criminal.

Penal code numbers: Some criminals get tattoos of the penal code numbers for the crimes they committed.

Cats: Can refer to thieves, especially among Russian criminal groups.

Masks and clown faces: These tattoos can represent a criminal's 'play now, pay later' lifestyle.

The judge in that case ruled Gibson, who had a shaved head, must grow his hair out in order to hide the inking as it could be prejudicial.

The same month Gibson went to trial, Jeffrey Chapman was given permission to wear a turtleneck to cover a tattoo of the word 'murder' spelled backward on his neck, amid concerns it would prejudice the jury at his upcoming murder trial in Kansas.

According to criminologists, other well-known gang-land designs include three dots inked in a triangle near and eye or in the corner of a hand represent the 'vida loco', or 'crazy life', of a criminal.

Another design, particularly popular in Russia, is a cat to denote a thief or burglar.

In Hernandez's case, officials said they have received several responses to their plea for information for tattoo artists who worked on him, but they wouldn't elaborate.

Boston police and the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office said the artists would be considered witnesses and are not accused of any wrongdoing.

Even if investigators do find the artists who created the tattoos they are interested in, it's not clear they would talk.

While there is no code on confidentiality between artist the artist and the person having the inking, Joe Capobianco, an artist from New Haven, said there is an 'unwritten code... on does not rat on one's clients.'

As for Hernandez, he says all his tattoos have personal meaning.

The stars on his right forearm surround a tattoo depicting being in God's hands, which he told USA Today in 2009 was meant as a nod to his older brother and late father.

Messages seeking comment were left for Hernandez's lawyers. They have said Hernandez looks forward to proving his innocence.
