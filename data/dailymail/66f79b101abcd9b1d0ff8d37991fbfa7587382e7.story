The newly-estranged wife of stunt motorcyclist Eddie Kidd has been questioned by police over allegations of assault, fraud and theft, it emerged today.

Sami Kirli, 44, was arrested and questioned by Sussex Police. She has been bailed until January 31 while detectives investigate the claims against her.

News of her arrest comes a day after it emerged that the former Grange Hill actress, who married Mr Kidd, 53, two years ago, was no longer living with her paralysed husband.

So happy: Eddie Kidd and his third wife Sami Kirli before the split

As revealed by Richard Kay yesterday, Ms Kirli moved out of their home in Seaford, near Brighton, while Mr Kidd changed his Facebook status from 'married' to 'single'.  Friends said he was consulting lawyers about a divorce.

Initially friends believed the strain of caring for Mr Kidd, who was left severely disabled after a 1996 motorcycle jump over 13 buses went wrong, was to blame for the marital breakdown.

But it emerged today this was not the case.

A friend of the motorcycle daredevil said: 'Sami has been asked to leave the marital property and is living elsewhere.  She is not allowed to go to the house.'

He added: Eddie is shocked and disgusted by these allegations.'

A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'A 44-year-old woman from Seaford has been arrested for common assault, theft and fraud.

'She has been questioned and bailed until January 31, 2013 while investigations continue.'

Ms Kirli wrote on her Facebook page that she was being 'misjudged at the mo'.

Mr Kidd, who was also previously married to Hot Gossip dancer Debbie Ash and ex-Stringfellows nightclub waitress Sarah Carr, first met Ms Kirli in 1988 when they had a brief relationship.

He left her heartbroken and she said she turned down six proposals from other men before she and Mr Kidd met by chance at a party in London's Mayfair in 2004.

They met again three years later and began a relationship.  Ms Kirli said: 'To me, he was the most gorgeous man who'd walked this earth'.

She abandoned plans to emigrate to Texas and six weeks later he proposed.  They married in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, in 2010 and Eddie said: 'I am the luckiest man alive'.

Last year Ms Kirli told a journalist that the paraplegic Mr Kidd was 'the only person I've truly been in love with'.

She added: 'If he died tomorrow, there'd be nothing left for me to carry on for.'

Mr Kidd has three children: Candie, 29, with his first wife Debbie, Jack, 18, with second wife Sarah, and Callum, now 10, with physiotherapy worker Olive Reynolds, whom he met after his accident at a rehabilitation centre in Hertfordshire.

A former James Bond stunt man, Mr Kidd was left in a coma for three-and-a-half months after breaking his neck and pelvis and suffering brain damage when a stunt went wrong in 1996.

It was at the Bulldog Bash, an annual motorcycle festival near Stratford-upon-Avon, where he landed badly after a comparatively minor jump and hit his head on the motorbike's petrol tank.

He is now confined to a wheelchair, unable to walk or even talk unaided and needs full-time care.
