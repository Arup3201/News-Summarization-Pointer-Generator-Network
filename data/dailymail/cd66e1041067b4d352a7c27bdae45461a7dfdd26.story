The disclosure over the Living Wage is a 'fresh embarrassment for the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, pictured

The Church of England, is paying more than 70 of its own workers less than the living wage - despite lecturing employers about their duty to pay higher salaries.

The care and cleaning staff, employed running sheltered housing schemes for retired clergy, earn less than the ‘living wage’ which the Church urges all companies to pay.

The living wage is supposed to ensure that families can afford food, clothes and rent.

The disclosure is a fresh embarrassment for the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, following the scandal over the Church’s investment in the controversial payday lender Wonga.

Archbishop Welby is a strong backer of the Church’s campaign to encourage employers to pay the living wage, which was calculated with the help of its own poverty campaigners, under the supervision of the Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu.

The living wage is currently set at £8.55 an hour in London and £7.45 in the rest of the country. 

The Church has declared that families cannot afford food, clothing or housing if their income is lower, and that it is ‘morally unacceptable that people should have to do multiple jobs and work long hours and yet still live in poverty’.

Archbishop Welby said in November 2012, just before he took over at Lambeth Palace, that championing the living wage was something ‘we should be shouting about.’

However the Church’s parliament, the General Synod, has now been told that one of the CofE’s own institutions has failed to listen to the message. 

Moreover, it will not begin to improve the low pay of its care workers until next spring.

Dr Philip Giddings of the CofE’s cabinet, the Archbishops’ Council, told the Synod: ‘In its supported housing scheme the Pensions Board employs 72 staff who are currently below the living wage.

‘The Board will implement the living wage in stages, starting April 2015.’

Dr Giddings added ‘most staff’ working for contractors used by the Church are paid the living wage, and ‘where they are not, agreement has been reached to phase in the appropriate uplift or, in one case, offer additional funds to an existing contractor to make the necessary uplift.’

The former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Williams, who retired at the end of 2012, has made plain his strong support for the living wage for care workers.

In an interview earlier this year he said it was wrong that care workers are often paid only the minimum wage of £6.31 an hour.

Paying the living wage was a ‘no brainer’, Lord Williams said, adding: ‘On that sort of salary you have to have three jobs to make ends meet, and rushing from the one to the other is disastrous.’

The Church’s most outspoken campaigner for the living wage has been the Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu.

Dr Sentamu said last year that ‘the holes in millions of pay cheques are being plugged by in-work support to the tune of £4 billion a year.

But why aren’t those who are profiting from their workers paying up? Why is the Government having to subsidise businesses which don’t pay their employees enough to live on?

Church investment chiefs finally withdrew their £75,000 stake in Wonga earlier this month, almost a year after Archbishop Welby first complained of his embarrassment at the Church’s involvement.

He added: ‘In the rush for profit, and for high pay at the top, too many companies have forgotten the basic moral imperative that employees be paid enough to live on.’

The CofE’s highest paid staff member is General Synod Secretary-General William Fittall, who is on over £150,000 a year, more than the Prime Minister. Since the Church is a charity, this salary puts Mr Fittall among the very best rewarded charity executives.

The 72 Pensions Board workers on less than the living wage are employed in eight supported housing schemes for elderly and vulnerable clergy, their spouses, and other CofE retired staff, which are established around the country.

Each couple accommodated pays around £2,000 a month for places in communities where low-paid staff provide meals, cleaning and personal care.

The CofE’s financial arm, the Church Commissioners, pulled out of the payday lender only under pressure from the Archbishop, who wants to see high interest short term loan firms replaced by Church-backed low interest credit unions.

The Commissioners had said they intended to maintain the Wonga investment, part of a stake in a venture capital company, because it would cost between £3 million and £9 million to get rid of it.

The Commissioners also said that Church investment would improve the behaviour of questionable companies, adding that ‘it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick.’

Their discovery that the money could after all be pulled from Wonga without large financial losses came less that two weeks after the Daily Mail revealed their intention to continue with the investment.
