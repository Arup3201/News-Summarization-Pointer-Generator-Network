Mauro Icardi's controversial relationship with Wanda Nara, the ex-wife of his best friend and team-mate Maxi Lopez, has read like the worst-scripted soap opera.

And the latest episode has remarkably managed to hit a new low after the Inter Milan striker decided to get a tattoo of the former couple's three children on his arm.

Icardi, now living with his new wife and the three children following their marriage in Buenos Aires, tweeted his new ink, with the message: 'I love these three little angels'.

Quite what Lopez will make of this latest development is anyone's guess.

But the Sampdoria striker had recently spoken out after the couple had put out Twitter images 
featuring the children he fathered with Nara.

'I
 can understand that, being a public figure, he publishes photos. But 
I'm not comfortable with my kids being in those photos,' Lopez said to Sky Sport.

He added: 'The kids are my strength... and they know I will do everything to protect them because they mean everything to me.'

Where is the love? Wanda Nara revealed in an interview that he marriage with Maxi Lopez was failing apart

The love triangle between the two players and Argentinian WAG Nara was 
exposed in November 2013 when it was revealed Icardi had made moves on 
his former friend's wife as their marriage fell apart.

The Inter Milan forward took to Twitter to declare: 'I love you [Wanda Nara], it will never be easy to say what I feel, 
because I discovered that those two words ('I love you' = 'te amo' in Spanish) 
carry with them one feeling without limits!'

The tweet coincided with an interview given by Nara released by Revista People, in which the model revealed: 'It’s been three months since my husband had sex. Maxi has neglected me. 
Although I’ve been living in luxury, I am also living with hidden pain.

'I think 
the time has passed for me to save my family. I will not fight for the money, 
because he knows me.'

The pair have since become renowned 
for posting almost daily declarations of their love over social media as
 well as numerous 'selfie' pictures.
