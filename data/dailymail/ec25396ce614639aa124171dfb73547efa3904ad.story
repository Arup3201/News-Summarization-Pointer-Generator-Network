As respected hospital consultants at the top of their profession you might expect them to set a good example to other staff.

Instead surgeon Jarrod Homer, 45, and anaesthetist Kamran Abbas, 43, went ‘toe-to-toe’ during a furious argument in a hospital corridor.

The war of words escalated into an unseemly scuffle with both consultants allegedly pushing and shoving each other around.

Row: Witnesses said Jarrod Homer (left) and Kamran Abbas (right) were 
involved in a furious altercation which ended in one losing a tooth

Desperate to avoid a full-scale 
punch-up, a nurse tried to split them up but accidentally knocked out 
one doctor’s teeth. Last night hospital bosses were carrying out an 
inquiry into the incident and both doctors have been told not to come 
into the hospital while it is ongoing.

It is understood there has been no 
criminal complaint and police were not called. But the incident is a 
major embarrassment for both consultants who are known for pioneering 
work in their fields.

Dr Abbas specialises in anaesthetising
 obese people and lectures on the topic. Mr Homer is an expert in head, 
neck, cancer and thyroid surgery.

The scuffle began as a minor row when 
Mr Homer complained about the length of time it was taking for patients 
to be brought to the operating theatre.It is understood the delays in 
administering anaesthetic were having a knock-on effect, with operations
 repeatedly being pushed back.

But the calm exchange of opinion 
outside the operating theatre in Manchester Royal Infirmary’s Ear, Nose 
and Throat department escalated into a furious row.

A senior hospital source said both 
consultants were ‘shouting at the top of their voices, bellowing at each
 other and pushing and shoving’.

He added: ‘The surgeon was accusing 
the anaesthetist of failing to bring patients down quickly enough for 
their operations and very quickly it became an argument over 
professional reputation.

‘There was such a ding-dong going on, 
with the doctors going toe-to-toe and holding on to each other, though 
no punches were thrown.  The nurse stepped in between the warring pair 
to stop it but as they were pushed apart one of the doctors was struck 
in the mouth.

‘He suffered quite a bad knock and was
 apparently quite dazed for a bit and we heard later he had lost one of 
his teeth as a result.’ It is not known which of the adversaries lost a 
tooth.

A senior doctor, who did not wish to 
be named, said the scandal had become the ‘water cooler’ topic of gossip
 for hospital staff.

He added: ‘It’s absolutely astonishing that the behaviour of two eminent consultants should descend to that of a bar-room row.

‘It’s probably best they keep their heads down for a few weeks.’
