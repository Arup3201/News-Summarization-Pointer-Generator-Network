Brightly-coloured primary school classrooms are being toned down with shades of beige to calm rowdy pupils - but fed-up teachers say the bland tones make them feel like they are working in Ikea.

Some schools, including Berkhamsted pre-prep school in Hertfordshire, are choosing to replace garish primary colours with neutral tones to calm children down while improving their behaviour and attainment levels.

Several schools and councils have employed Elizabeth Jarman, an education expert who specialises in creating effective learning environment to help improve their classrooms.

Traditional, brightly-coloured primary school classrooms are being replaced with a muted palette of beige in a bid to calm rowdy pupils, particularly in younger classes - but some teachers do not like the changes

Berkhamsted head teacher Samantha Jaspal told The Times: 'Not all staff like the look of a beige, natural classroom and are comparing it with a Swedish store showroom.'

She went on to explain that they made the changes to a blander environment after noticing children appeared to prefer being taught outside in a natural environment.

They replaced brightly coloured display boards to hessian and swapped colourful tables for natural wood - and Ms Jaspal says the changes have had a clear impact on pupils' focus and behaviour in the classroom. 

Some teachers do not approve of the blander classrooms and say it makes them feel like they work at Ikea

'Children who are easily distracted are able to concentrate for longer periods if the spaces around them are uncluttered.' she said.

'We have noticed this particularly when teaching early reading.'

Ms Jarman, who has a background in teaching, told MailOnline: ‘We know so much more about children’s brains now and they are critical ingredients when we are thinking about environments.

‘We need to challenge some of the historical stereotypes about the way that environments have traditionally been set up for children, based on what we know today about brain development, language acquisition, child development and attachment theory.’

When asked about the Ikea comment, Ms Jarman said: ‘I would agree. A lot of the thinking we challenge, people hold onto because that’s how they’ve always done it and that’s what you expect to see.

‘When you look in toy shops and the environments children are spending time in, they just give them sensory overload.

‘We need to get the balance right, that is so important.

‘In a world of information overload we need to be thinking about where are the places you can be still, reflect and consolidate your thinking? We need to create more of that.’

In 2006 research claimed brightly decorated classrooms covered with colourful displays can damage children's education and some primary schools were told to tone down their environments.

The report from the Basic Skills Agency warned that classrooms which were too 'cluttered' with colour could disrupt young children's concentration.

The report said: 'Over-stimulating environments are not always the best.

'That has implications for the use of displays. Sometimes it is a visual overload for children.

'It can make it very difficult for them to concentrate.'

Schools are replacing bright colours  and de-cluttering classrooms to make them calmer places to learn

The study focused on how the school environment can affect children's speaking and listening skills. 

The report added: 'Spaces should take account of environmental factors that can impact on learning, for example, light, colour, noise.

'The environment should not be over-stimulating.

'Cosy, small areas, where children feel safe and able to chat in privacy are necessary.'
