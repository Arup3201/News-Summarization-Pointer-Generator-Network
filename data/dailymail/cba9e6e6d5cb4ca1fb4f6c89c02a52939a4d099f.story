Manchester United are satisfied with assurances from Radamel Falcao and his camp that the Colombia star has not lied about his age.

Reports resurfaced over the weekend claiming that Falcao is 30, not 28. The issue is sensitive because United have an option to sign the striker on a long-term contract at the end of his £6million loan move from Monaco next summer, taking the total fee to £52m.

It is understood that United sought assurances on deadline day and were happy with the documentation provided.

New start: Reports resurfaced over the weekend claiming that Falcao is 30, not 28, but they appear untrue

Prove it! United sought assurances on deadline day and were happy with the documentation provided

Born: Colombia, February 10 1986 (age 28)

Playing position: Striker

1999-2001: Lanceros Boyaca (8 apps, 1 gls)

2001-2009: River Plate (90, 34)

2009-2011: Porto (51, 41)

2011-2013: Atletico Madrid (68, 52)

2013-2014: AS Monaco (20, 11)

2014-NOW: Manchester United (loan) (0, 0)

The birth date of February 10, 1986 on Falcao’s passport has been used to complete his £280,000-a-week contract and his work-permit paperwork.

United said: ‘We were aware of the rumours but it was never an issue for us.’

Controversy first arose when Falcao, who made his senior debut for Colombian Second Division club Lanceros at the age of 13, was playing for River Plate in Argentina. It was then alleged that he had doctored his age so he could play at the Under-20 World Cup in 2005.

In 2012, Falcao’s old school leaked documents claiming that he was born in 1984. That led to his family releasing his birth certificate to the Colombian media.

United’s chief concern was Falcao’s left knee after surgery to repair a cruciate ligament injury. The player passed a rigorous United medical before making his Colombia comeback on Friday in Miami, when he played 13 minutes of a 1-0 loss to Brazil.

Falcao said later: ‘Physically, I feel spectacular. As I get into game shape, I believe I’ll show I’m still at the top level.’

While in Miami, Falcao applied for his visa at the British Consulate. United expect none of the complications that delayed clearance for Marcos Rojo, their Argentine signing.

Rumours: In 2012, Falcao’s old school leaked documents claiming that he was born in 1984 and not 1986

Fit and ready: United’s chief concern was Falcao’s left knee after surgery to repair a cruciate ligament injury
