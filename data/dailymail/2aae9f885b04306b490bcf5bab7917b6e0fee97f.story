Gunmen have murdered a man with suspected links to the secretive Camorra Mafia syndicate at the wheel of his car in broad daylight.

The shocking killing comes a week after Italy's escalating gang wars claimed their most poignant victim - a three-year-old boy whose grandfather failed to repay a drug debt.

Police in Naples, Italy, said the car belonging to 46-year-old victim Antonio Errichiello was flanked by another from which several shots were fired.

Killed: The victim, named in Italian media as Antonio Errichiello, was gunned down in broad daylight

Murdered: The shaven-headed victim, said to have Mafia links, was seen with blood on his face and shirt

Crime-hit: The Secondigliano neighbourhood where he was shot is home to a fierce turf war over drugs

Deadly trade: Police estimate illegal drugs in just two Naples districts are worth £79 million a year

Italian media reported the victim, who was driving at the time, was already known to law enforcement officers and had been linked to the Licciardi clan, one of several in the Camorra.

'A man died in Naples in an ambush, L'Unita reported. 'The man was approached by two people in the car who fired 
several shots at him.'

The newspaper claimed the man, nicknamed 'O Cinese, had been released from prison in May last year and had a lengthy criminal record.

The Secondigliano neighbourhood where 
he was shot is home to one of Italy's fiercest turf wars over the 
hotly-contested drug empire in the region.

Police estimate the illegal drugs trade in the area and nearby Scampia is worth £79 million a year, with dozens of killings in the battle for domination.

Onlookers can be seen gathering close to the scene as the victim, shaven-headed and wearing a black puffer jacket, lies dead in the driver's seat with blood trickling down his temples.

Mafia: The man was reportedly ambushed by what could be members of a rival clan in Naples, Italy

Police later hid the scene from view with a sheet. The Camorra are engaged in fierce, bloody in-fighting

Italian media reported the victim, who was driving at the time, was already known to law enforcement officers and had been linked to the Licciardi clan, one of several in the Camorra which is at war with other families

Shock: Crowds of onlookers gathered at the scene in one of Italy's most crime-ridden city neighbourhoods

Common event: The brazen killing was a shock to those in the neighbourhood, but not much of a surprise

The Italian Mafia syndicate, which dates back hundreds of years, is said to control everything from the drug industry to waste collection in the south of the country

It is made up of family-based clans which have worked together in the past but also fight brutal wars against each other, with bloody results.

Last week the body of toddler Nicola Campolongo was found in a burnt-out car in Cosenza, Calabria.

Police believed both the killers and the victims, which also included the three-year-old's Salvatore Iannicelli, 52, and his girlfriend Ibtissa Touss, 27, hailed from the equally war-torn Ndrangheta Mafia syndicate.

On top of the car was a single unmarked 50 cent piece, apparently a symbol that the grandfather had not paid his debt.
