Mauricio Pochettino has confessed to a late-night darts habit and has even organised his home viewing arrangements so he can have an eye on the arrows as he studies football matches beamed into his home from around Europe.

'I was watching the Europa League, on Thursday night, all the games,' said Tottenham boss Pochettino. 'I had two screens set up. One with the Europa League on, and the other with Premier League Darts. It's true.

'We don't have darts in Argentina but ever since I arrived in Southampton I've been a fan. I don't play and I've not been to see it live. I prefer to watch at home.'

Some of his Spurs players share his love for the game. Jan Vertonghen, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose and Andros Townsend, were spotted at Alexandra Palace in January watching the semi-finals of the World Darts Championships.

Tottenham's exit from the Europa League, beaten in the second round by Fiorentina, has brought the consolation of allowing their Argentine manager to tune in for the Premier League Darts fixtures on Thursday nights.

'I was not happy to go out, my preference would have been to be playing against Roma,' said Pochettino, but it has been another difficult season for English clubs in European competition.

Only Everton remain in the Europa League, while Arsenal and Manchester City must overturn first-leg deficits next week in Monaco and Barcelona respectively, if they are to reach the last eight of the Champions League.

'European teams have an advantage on English teams,' said Pochettino. 'The most difficult period of the season in England is Christmas when they have a break. In February and March it is very tough for the English teams.

'The number of games we play is more than the European teams. This is the key. Teams in the other leagues are fresher then the English teams.

'Our competition is the toughest in the world. Maybe this explains the results in Europe. Teams like Paris Saint-Germain are only focused on the Champions League. Chelsea are focused on the Capital One Cup and the Premier League.

'It's not an excuse but the reality. It's very difficult to arrive fresh in the same way another team from Europe arrives fresh in the Champions League or the Europa League.'

Spurs, sixth in the Premier League with 10 to play, have won twice since they lost to Fiorentina and were beaten in the Capital One Cup final by Chelsea.

Like any darts fan, Pochettino knows the way his team finish will be all-important. They are at fourth-placed Manchester United on Sunday and victory will boost their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League.
