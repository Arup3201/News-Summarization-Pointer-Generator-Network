Labour election candidate Del Singh, who was killed last night in Kabul, was a former advisor to the UN and Department for International Development whose work had taken him to a string of trouble spots.

Born and raised in Southampton, Hampshire, to factory worker parents, he went on to earn a Business degree and a Masters in European Studies, before beginning work with the EU in 2000.

According to a website set up to help his election bid, Mr Singh from 2002-2004 worked for as an Adviser to the European Mission in Kosovo, where he helped develop the first economic national plan for the country.

In 2006/7, in Sudan, he managed a European Commission aid development programme and has also worked on UN and DfID funded projects in Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Libya, Nepal, and Palestine.

It is unclear what he was doing in Afghanistan at the time of his death, but he had worked in at least four different roles advising on development in the country over the past decade.

A campaigner for the Labour Party since 1992, he had worked part time between 1999 and 2000 as a research assistant for Nick Ainger, then Wales Minister, and in 2004 in support of John Prescott as Deputy Prime Minister.

Mr Singh had hoped to represent the South West in the European Parliament, running on a ticket promising greater regulation for banks and tighter rules on corporate tax.

The
 activist – full name Dharmender Singh Phangura – was due to stand in 
this year’s European elections and had been placed fourth on the Labour 
list of candidates for the South East region.

Girlfriend,
 Komal Adris, 35, said: ‘Everyone in our family is upset, shocked and 
devastated.

'He was such a friendly and happy person.He genuinely cared 
about Afghanistan and he loved the country.

Mr
 Singh, from Southampton, had been in Kabul for a week, working with the
 Afghan government’s budget department on behalf of the Adam Smith 
International consultancy firm.

Mr Miliband was among senior Labour figures to also pay tribute to Mr Singh.

He
 said: ‘My thoughts –  and the thoughts of the Labour Party – are with 
the family and friends of Mr Singh. He dedicated his life to working 
with people across the world who needed his support.’

Mr
 Singh was a life-long Labour supporter and had spells working in 
British government departments, including the Department for 
International Development and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, 
where he advised John Prescott.

He advised Mr Miliband on the Middle East as an executive of the Labour
 Friends of Palestine and worked in international development for a 
decade in war zones such as Sierra Leone, Palestine, Libya and 
Afghanistan.

His sister, Dishi Phangura, 34,  spoke to him on the text messaging service, WhatsApp, just three hours before he was killed.

She
 said: ‘He was so optimistic so there was no suggestion something like 
this was about to happen. It’s a heavily guarded restaurant.

‘He
 was due to go to Afghanistan at the beginning of the year, but he 
waited to celebrate my mother’s birthday the day before he left.’

Former
 soldier Mr Chase, 41, had spent time in Northern Ireland, serving in 
the Cheshire and the Royal Irish regiments.

He had been working as a 
private security guard in Kabul for a number of years.

His
 partner, Norma McDowell, 35, and their two children, Alfie and Jake, 
were last night being consoled by relatives at the couple’s home in 
Limavady, Co Londonderry.

James McCorkell, the Deputy Mayor of Limavady, said: ‘Simon was carrying out an incredibly important yet highly dangerous job.

He was extremely brave and fearless in his service, yet also incredibly kind and loving.’
