There can't be many social occasions that would cause Katie Hopkins and Katie Price to cross paths. 

And it is just as well, because The Apprentice star and professional loudmouth has put her foot in it again - insulting the former glamour model's latest baby name. 

After a six week wait, Katie Price finally announced that her fifth child - her second with current husband Kieran Hayler - would be called Bunny.

'BUNNY? Makes sense I guess, given your dad was going at it like a rabbit with all of mum's mates': Katie Hopkins (right) has taken a dig at Katie's Price (left) and her latest choice of baby name

The news was met with a typically acerbic tweet from Ms Hopkins, who wrote: 'Bunny? BUNNY? Makes sense I guess, given your dad was going at it like a rabbit with all of mum's mates.' 

The remarks are bound to sting Katie, who has spent the last few months battling to save her marriage to Kieran, 27. 

In June, the 36-year-old discovered he had cheated on her with her best friends Jane Pountney, 49 and Chrissy Thomas, 41.

Katie Hopkins was quick to tweet her disgust at Katie Price's new baby name 

But the couple has spent the last few months sorting through their problems and decided to give their relationship another try, with Kieran even present for the birth of Bunny in August. 

After the birth, Katie revealed it had been a struggle to find a name that both she and Kieran liked. 

She said: 'We’ve really struggled to decide on a name! I was totally set on Duchess Kate or just Duchess, but Kieran didn’t like that, so we’ve chosen Bunny, which we both like.' 

Although the name Bunny might leave a sour taste in Ms Hopkins' mouth, it isn't the first time she has has made derogatory comments about what parents call their children. 

Katie pictured with her offspring- India, nine, Poppy, seven, and Max, four, who she tries to deter from playing with ‘lower class’ children with names like Chantelle, Charmaine, Chardonnay and Tyler 

Last year, the TV commentator revealed that she refused to let her three offspring - India, nine, Poppy, seven, and Max, four, play with ‘lower class’ children with names like Chantelle, Charmaine, Chardonnay and Tyler.

She said: 'I think you can tell a great deal from a name. 

'For me, there’s certain names that I hear and I think “urgh”.

‘For me, a name is a shortcut of finding out what class a child comes from and makes me ask: “Do I want my children to play with them?”

‘When I hear screeched across the playground: “Tyler! Come back ‘ere.” It’s the Tylers, the Charmains the Chantelles, the Chardonnays.’

 She added: ‘There’s a whole set of things that go with children like that, who are quite a disruptive influence in school and that’s why I don’t like those kind of children.

‘I tend to think that children who have intelligent names tend to have fairly intelligent parents and they make much better play-dates for my children.

‘We are really time short in this world and we need shortcuts to make decisions. It’s very effective.’
