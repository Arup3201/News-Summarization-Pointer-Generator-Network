A mother is in jail accused of plotting to get her daughters to murder their grandparents.

Leticia Silva, 31, of Lakeland, Florida, is said to have mailed a switchblade pocket knife to the girls, aged seven and nine, last December with instructions for them to use it to murder her former in-laws.

She is alleged to have then called them around Christmas and told them to grab a steak knife from the kitchen to kill their grandparents.

The 'plot' came to light when the girls' grandmother found a blade under one of their pillows last month.

Silva's daughters have lived with their grandparents in Greenville, Pitt County, North Carolina, for seven years.

She lost permanent custody of her children when she was sent to prison in Florida for possession of methamphetamines, according to Tampa Bay's WFLA.

Silva turned herself into the Pitt County Detention Center on Monday after driving up from Florida with her family.

She is charged with four counts of first-degree solicitation to commit murder and is being held under a $5million secured bond.

In a court appearance on Tuesday, a judge said she could face up to 40 years and one month for each count if convicted.

She requested a reduction in bail, which was refused, telling the judge,  'Your 
honor,  I need… my family is here from Florida. I turned myself in. I 
need to see if I can get a bond reduction.'

She also asked: 'Is there any way that I can get a special visitation allowed before they leave?'

Silva's family believe she has been set up and told the media that there had been an 'ugly' custody battle between her and her former in-laws for years.

Investigators do not think the children intended to carry out their mother's instructions and believe they have proof of the plot.

Pitt County Detective Charles Mitchell said: 'It's hard to say what a child is going to do.

'The grandparents have told me that they spoke to the children and neither one of them would carry it out.

'They said that they love their grandparents very much.'

A neighbor, who did not wish to be identified, told ABC News: 'They're 
the sweetest little girls and I don't think they would hurt anybody.'

Silva's friend, Mary Snell, told WFLA that Silva was determined to regain custody of her daughters.

'Her one goal in life was to get them back,' Snell told WFLA.

Silva's next court appearance is scheduled for March 21.
