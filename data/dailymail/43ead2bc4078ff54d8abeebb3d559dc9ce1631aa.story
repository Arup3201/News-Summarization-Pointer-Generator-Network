So, no points at stake, and the FA Community Shield may count for a big fat zero in the grand scheme, but try telling those at Arsenal who detected the wind of change amid the chaos of Hurricane Bertha.

After ending nine empty years with the FA Cup in May, here was their first Shield win since the Invincibles era and the man responsible for transporting the trophy across North London seemed at odds with its heavy wooden travelling box as he left the premises.

Those who packed the red-and-white end of Wembley Stadium on Sunday truly enjoyed this victory, gathering more silver and a slice of revenge over Manchester City — a team who keep poaching their players and smashed six past them at the Etihad last year.

When Olivier Giroud lashed a spectacular third into the top corner from 25 yards, the Arsenal supporters launched an impromptu ‘Poznan’ celebration designed to taunt the City fans.

Ratings by SAMI MOKBEL at Wembley 

Soon they were singing Arsene Wenger’s name. To think, when his team trailed to Wigan in the FA Cup semi-final, shortly after losing 3-0 at Everton and surrendering the initiative in the race for the top four, it seemed the Frenchman was nearing the end of his Arsenal odyssey.

Four months on and his team are heading into this campaign more optimistic than for many years, fuelled by this emphatic scoreline, performance, a clean sheet and goals from Giroud, Santi Cazorla (below) and Aaron Ramsey.

It is ever thus in this annual fixture. If it goes badly, as it did for City manager Manuel Pellegrini, then shrug and pretend it was never more than a glorified preparation game. If it goes well, then seize the moment and squeeze out all the positive energy you can.

Wenger needed no prompting. He was quick to emphasise the game’s value and bask in his wealth of attacking options.

It is remarkable how an FA Cup win can transform the atmosphere at a club. Not the magic of the cup in a traditional sense, but it has cast a spell and the infighting which has plagued Arsenal in recent years has abated.

Even Alisher Usmanov, the clubs second largest shareholder, has emerged with an olive branch for owner Stan Kroenke.

VIDEO Wenger hails 'complete' Arsenal performance 

Mockery: Arsenal fans poked fun at the City supporters by doing the 'Poznan' celebration after the third goal

Crisp finish: Cazorla drove into the bottom right-hand corner with his left foot to open the scoring 

Skipping in: Goalkeeper Willy Caballero could do nothing about the effort as it bobbled beyond him

Happy man: Cazorla wheeled away in celebration after finding the net in the 21st minute 

More than that, Wenger’s team shows signs that it might be developing nicely into a unit with balance and solidity, as well as its customary flair.

The squad remains thin in some areas — like central defence and centre forward — but there were just enough flashes of Alexis Sanchez to leave the crowd wanting more and teenager Calum Chambers has the makings of a composed central defender.

Jack Wilshere performed well and Yaya Sanogo proved again that his raw talent is not easy to defend against. City’s young centre halves certainly made it look that way and Sanogo was central to the first two goals.

First, he brought down the ball and nudged it to Wilshere. The England man was then flattened by Dedryck Boyata as he allowed the pass to roll on to Cazorla who, in turn, drove it past Willy Caballero. 

All smiles: Calum Chambers goes over to congratulate the playmaker after he found the net 

Linking up so soon: Cazorla gets a hug from Sanchez after opening the scoring in the capital 

Sanogo had continued to run into an offside position, arguably across the goalkeeper’s line of sight, but there was no great dispute and Arsenal were ahead, deservedly so.

Sanogo then dragged an effort wide, having been released by Cazorla, and forced a save with a header from a corner, before assisting Ramsey for the second.

After 16 goals last season, culminating in the winner in the FA Cup final, Ramsey is off and running again. He took the ball from Sanogo, twisted and slammed it low past Caballero, who had been preferred to England No 1 Joe Hart.

This may have been a good game for Hart to miss. Caballero was badly exposed by a patchwork back four and Hart could be back for Sunday’s trip to Newcastle. City, however, does not seem like a happy place for English players.

Off to a flyer: Ramsey was already on his way to celebrate as the ball hit the back of the net 

All too easy: Arsenal were roared forward by Ramsey from midfield and raced into a 2-0 half-time lead

Getting a soaking: The triumphant Arsenal players sprayed each other with champagne afterwards

The manager started with a grand total of none. Clearly he has reservations about Hart and preferred to play Gael Clichy out of position at right-back rather than to start with Micah Richards.

It is a side issue. Pellegrini’s greatest worry will be the way his team defended all over the pitch, even if they were without so many stars because he refused to consider those who had played beyond the group stages of the World Cup.

Arsenal were missing their own German trio of World Cup winners but looked slicker and more competitive, ready for the challenges ahead, which include a Champions League play-off tie with Besiktas.

The season looks to be upon City a little too soon, though Pellegrini is safe in the knowledge he judged last season’s run perfectly. 

Shut your eyes: Oxlade-Chamberland, Wilshere, Cazorla, Sanchez and Arteta smile after getting wet 

Picture perfect: Cazorla borrows a camera and takes a selfie with full back Nacho Monreal on the pitch

The champions improved in the second half. David Silva added intelligence to their football which provided a lift and Stevan Jovetic hit a post with a header, having beaten Mathieu Debuchy in the air. Wojciech Szczesny then denied him with a smart save, low to his right.

Giroud put the outcome beyond doubt on the hour, with an eye-catching strike which beat Caballero, having clipped Matija Nastasic to acquire the added loop required to find the top corner.

Cue the Poznan and dancing in the aisles.

‘Our doctor thinks it could be broken — and that will be four to six weeks minimum.

‘But I’m pleased for Scott Gallacher, who has come in from Rangers a few weeks ago, as he wants to play football and he will get that opportunity here now.’
