Prudent savers have been hit by a ‘catastrophic’ fall in interest rates over the past year with accounts paying an average of just 0.44 per cent.

Many homeowners are benefiting from low interest rates, but a Bank of England report yesterday laid bare the pain being inflicted on Britain’s savers.

With a nest egg of £1,000, the average account would earn interest of just £4.40 a year – which would then be taxed.

'Catastrophic': Savers have been hit with a fall in interest rates, with accounts paying an average of 0.44 per cent

But homeowners are being offered the cheapest loan deals since records began in 1998. The average two-year fixed-rate deal for a person with a 25 per cent deposit charges 2.56 per cent.

Last August, homeowners were typically being charged 3.69 per cent, which means they are saving £89 on the monthly repayments for a £150,000 loan.

Savings groups blame the Funding For Lending scheme, launched in August 2012, which let banks borrow cheaply from the Bank of England, rather than encourage savers to make deposits.

Banks can borrow an unlimited amount at as little as 0.25 per cent interest as long as they maintain, or increase, lending to individuals and businesses.

A report, from financial data firm Moneyfacts, warns the interest on fixed-rate bonds, dubbed the ‘darling of the savings market’, has also collapsed. Sylvia Waycot, from Moneyfacts, said it took just a month from launch for Funding For Lending to devastate the market. She added: ‘Anyone opting for an easy life by just rolling the bond into another term may have a shock when they get their interest due to the catastrophic fall in rates.’

In September 2008, a £10,000 five-year fixed-rate bond typically paid 5.17 per cent, equal to total interest of £2,866. Five years later, the average is 2.28 per cent, giving just £1,193 – less than half the gain from the 2008 deal.

Saving: Homeowners, however, are being offered the cheapest loan deals since records began

Simon Rose, from the campaign group Save Our Savers, said: ‘Prudent savers who have put money by, often for their retirement, are having the rug pulled out from under them.

‘Every day we hear from people who rely on their savings who are in despair at their increasingly precarious situation.’

Since January, there have been 1,181 cuts in interest rates, but only 52 rate increases, according to the group Savings Champion.

It counted the rate cuts on all variable-rate accounts, including tax-free cash ISAs.

Anna Bowes, of Savings Champion, said: ‘Savers have been hammered this year. How much more pain can savers endure?’

The news comes as it emerged that three million Britons borrowed money in July to pay for food. A report by the Debt Advisory Centre said around 2.5million people also borrowed to pay their energy or water bill.

Figures also show that Britons borrowed £8.4billion on their credit cards last month, the most since records began.
