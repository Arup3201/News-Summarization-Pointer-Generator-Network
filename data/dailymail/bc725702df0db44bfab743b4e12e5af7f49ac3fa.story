An Oklahoma woman says three police officers beat her husband to death in front of their daughter following a violent argument she had with the teen outside a movie theater.

Moore police spokesman Jeremy Lewis says Luis Rodriguez died after an altercation with officers early Saturday morning in a parking lot outside Warren Theater in the central Oklahoma city.

Rodriguez’s wife, Nair, and daughter, Luinahi, told local media that the two women had gotten into a fight outside the theater and Luis Rodriguez chased them into the parking lot in a bid to restrain his wife.

According to Lewis, when three police officers and two security guards attempted to question Mr Rodriguez, he was uncooperative.

He was handcuffed and placed on the ground. That’s when his family say police beat him to death.The entire incident was captured by Mrs Rodriguez on her cellphone, which she says officers then seized from her as evidence without producing a warrant.

Lewis says police are reviewing the recording. The three officers involved in the deadly confrontation have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the internal investigation. 

Nair Rodriguez told the station News9 the family emerged from the cinema shortly after midnight, at which point she and her daughter, Luinahi, got into a heated argument and the mother slapped the teen before storming away.

Her husband went after her to calm her down, but he was stopped by police asking him for his ID.

According to the mother and daughter, Mr Rodriguez tried to walk around the officers in order to prevent his wife from getting behind the wheel in such an emotional state.

Insult to injury: Mrs Rodriguez said the officers took away her cell phone, which she used to record her husband's beating

That is when the family say two on-duty Moore cops, one off-duty officer and a pair of security guards fell on Rodriguez, kicking and punching him in the head as he lay on the ground.

‘When they flipped him over you could see all the blood on his face, it was, he was disfigured, you couldn't recognize him,’ a tearful Luinahi Rodriguez said of her father.

It wasn't until the man’s motionless body was carried away on a stretcher that police allegedly approached his now-widow and asked her about what happened.

‘I told them I hit her and he was just trying to reach me. Why didn't they arrest me?’ Mrs Rodriguez demanded.

Mrs Rodriguez challenged the police department’s claim that her husband passed away in a hospital, insisting that he died on the scene after being struck in the head.

‘They just viciously took his life,’ an emotional Nair Rodriguez told the news channel KOCO.

Describing her husband of 22 years, Nair Rodriguez told KFOR he was a loving family man who was a ‘grizzly bear with a teddy bear heart.’

‘I’m screaming for justice,’ the widow said.
