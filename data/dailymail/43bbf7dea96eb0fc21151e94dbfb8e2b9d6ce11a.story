Revealing study: The Norwegian team say that 'less-attractive' people are often less conscious of their bodies than 'good-looking' people

For better or for worse, society has 'ideals' in terms of what an an attractive body is.

Ask people to define a physically good-looking person, and most will list being 'thin' and 'in-shape' as characteristics, and perhaps they will offer up Michelangelo's David or the Venus De Milo as good archetypes.

But a surprising study from Norway suggests that those who are furthest away from these 'ideals' are just as satisfied with their appearance.

In fact, the study found those with 'good looking' bodies were more likely to be self-conscious about their appearance.

The study, at the National Institute for Consumer 
Research, saw researchers Mari Rysst and Ingun Grimstad Klepp hold in-depth interviews with 20 Norwegian men and women.

According to Science Nordic, half of the group was categorised as 'bodily deviant' - either struggling with obesity for years, suffering burn damage, or with physical handicaps.

The 'bodily deviant informants' were asked to describe an attractive or sexy body
and - while acknowledging the slim and fit ideal - stressed that personality as well as charm and charisma were the most 
important and attractive features.

Pulling out examples from the study, the team point to one obese woman who found men 'who cared for others to be 
sexy and that 'a good-looking body may just as well be chubby as 
thin, really. To me it doesn’t matter.'

The 'most obese informant' meanwhile said 'a sexy body has a
lot to do with the personality that shines through'.

Rysst suggested the overweight participants would downplay the importance of appearance 'to legitimise and normalise their own oversized and untrained bodies' and 'feel better about themselves'.

Rysst added: 'Some of those whose bodies were obviously too large said they were pretty satisfied.

One participant, a 30-year-old known as Storm, had severe skin damage due to a fire injury.

But
he told the researchers that was accustomed to his scars - and instead 
noticed other things about his body that he would like to change.

He said: 'One has to accept what it is impossible to do anything about, otherwise things get too difficult.'

'One obese woman had learned to completely ignore her own body and led a life with good confidence and a good job.'

The team conclude that those outside 'the norm' will accept their body features as they are difficult or impossible to change.

Meanwhile those in the study with average and good-looking bodies seemed less satisfied than those with deviant bodies.

Rysst told Science Nordic: 'It was surprising to us that those who were rather fit and slim were dissatisfied with their looks.

'I think people are affected by pictures that are displayed in media, advertisements and public space without really knowing it.

'Our ideas of the perfect body is shaped by what we're exposed to, and we're exposed to it no matter if we like it or not.

'But this reflects the society we live in – you can't be too good-looking.'
