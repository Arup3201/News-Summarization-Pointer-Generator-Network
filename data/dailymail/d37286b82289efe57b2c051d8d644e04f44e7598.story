Leading world press freedom organisations condemned the Government’s Royal Charter on press regulation yesterday as ‘no form of solution at all’.

The charter was drawn up by politicians and approved by the Queen in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists.

But in a highly critical report, the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) said excluding the newspaper industry from the final drafting process was ‘a major error’.

It said any regulatory system must have the support of the industry and warned there was growing evidence that moves to heavily regulate Britain’s newspapers are being used by repressive regimes to excuse their own press curbs.

The Royal Charter underpins with statute a new body to oversee the regulation of the Press, with publications that refuse to comply facing exemplary damages in libel cases.

Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up, fearing it would bring an end to 300 years of press freedom.

Instead, the Press is establishing a fully independent body to police its activities, the Independent Press Standards Organisation. It will be able to impose fines of up to £1million for serious and systemic wrongdoing.

The WAN-IFRA report, Press Freedom In The UK, follows a two-day fact-finding mission by international editors to the UK in January.

The 42-page document said: ‘The exclusion of the industry in the final drafting process of the Royal Charter was a major error, if the intention was for a genuine improvement in the culture, ethics and professionalism of the Press.

‘A solution that did not include any of the media industry is entirely counterproductive, and can be described as no form of solution at all.

There has been a real lack of public discussion about the implications of the issues raised by the Leveson Inquiry and their effects – positively or negatively – for freedom of expression in the UK.

‘The speed of implementation of the Royal Charter proposal, coupled with the lack of legislative scrutiny, parliamentary vote or public consultation, has undoubtedly contributed to a general lack of understanding around the issues. The entire negotiation process in the build-up to a deal on a new system for regulation should have been more transparent.’

Referring to ‘UK government interference’ towards the Guardian following its publication of US surveillance stories based on information from whistleblower Edward Snowden, it adds: ‘Political assurances that the Royal Charter scheme provides a hands-off solution for press regulation and can guarantee press freedom are somewhat undermined by the readiness of the UK government to intervene against the Guardian.’

WAN-IFRA said: 'The royal charter system - used as an example or transposed elsewhere to countries lacking the United Kingdom's historic commitment to human rights - risks an open invitation for abuse in other parts of the world'

WAN-IFRA, which represents more than 18,000 publications, 15,000 online sites and 3,000 companies in more than 120 countries, warns that ‘even the suggestion of a decline in Britain’s regard for press freedom risks serious repercussions in other parts of the world’.

It said: ‘The royal charter system – used as an example or transposed elsewhere to countries lacking the United Kingdom’s historic commitment to human rights – risks an open invitation for abuse in other parts of the world.

‘There is growing evidence, reported by the WAN-IFRA membership, that the British approach – either in terms of regulation, or in the misuse of terrorism and national security legislation – is being used by repressive regimes to excuse their own practices towards the Press.

The British Government... should reiterate clearly to the international community that it continues to support a free and independent press, and back these statements with discernible action at home to support rather than punish journalism.’

Its chief executive Vincent Peyregne said: ‘Given the UK’s continued influence over developing nations where media are essential for the spread of democratic values, the future of a free, independent press... is under threat worldwide.’

Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said the report was a ‘sad and damning indictment of the political classes in a country that prides itself on being the mother of modern democracies’.

He added: ‘No wonder journalists across the world are concerned that Britain, which lectures other countries about press freedom, has after 300 years taken a retrograde step in its own backyard.

‘We hope ministers will take note of the call to support a free and independent press internationally and back these statements with discernible action at home to support rather than punish journalism.’
