Hibernian have been granted permission by Everton to speak with Alan Stubbs about the vacant manager’s job at Easter Road.

The former Celtic defender has been identified by chief executive Leeann Dempster as the ideal candidate to rebuild the club.

It’s understood talks will take place between both parties in the coming days before a decision is made on whether to offer the ambitious 42-year-old the post.

Credentials: Stubbs has worked under David Moyes and Roberto Martinez during his time at Goodison

Stubbs, currently Everton reserve-team manager, is well versed in Scottish football from his five years at Celtic between 1996 and 2001, and has made it clear that he covets a front-line managerial job.

He was interviewed for the Everton manager’s job following Davie Moyes’ departure a year ago but chairman Bill Kenwright opted for Wigan boss Roberto Martinez.

Stubbs, who enjoyed two spells with his Merseyside boyhood heroes as a player, is well regarded within Goodison but he feels the time is now right to strike out on his own.

Mark Venus, who was Tony Mowbray’s No2 at Easter Road, remains the favourite for the position.

Dumbarton manager and former Hibs skipper Ian Murray has also been linked but it’s understood Hibs haven’t yet approached the Sons about speaking with him.

Motherwell boss Stuart McCall, who Dempster worked well with at Fir Park, has also been mentioned but it’s believed he’s unwilling to entertain leaving the Premiership for the Championship at this stage.

Former Leeds striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has also applied for the job.

John Collins was on Dempster’s wish list but was unveiled as Ronny Deila’s assistant at Celtic on Tuesday.
