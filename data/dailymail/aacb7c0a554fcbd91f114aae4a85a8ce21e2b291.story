More than 50 per cent of Britons go online when they are in bed and trying to sleep, a new survey has revealed.

Only 11 per cent of the people questioned said they had good quality sleep which could, in part, be because 24 per cent of people are ‘addicted’ to checking their emails and social media when they are in bed.

The survey also showed that 21 per cent of people go online when they are in bed because they are scared of ‘missing out’.

Some 24 per cent of people are 'addicted' to checking their emails and social media when they are in bed and the habit is causing sleepless nights

The study showed that people’s smartphone addictions also affect the rest of their day.

It revealed that 43 per cent of Britons use their smartphone while watching television, and that 18 per cent use an iPad while watching TV.

The stress of our constantly connected lifestyles is the biggest factor keeping us awake at night.

Even when we do nod off,  many of us experience broken sleep, with 60 per cent of us waking up three times or more per night.

Dr Chris Idzikowski, Director of the 
Edinburgh Sleep Centre said: ‘As technology to keep us connected 
improves, we face a new battle with trying to switch off at night.

'Never before in history have we faced such an overload of information, causing people in the UK to suffer from a rising tide of sleep problems.’ 

Research has previously shown that the blue light emitted by devices like smartphones and tablets can stop users from getting a good night’s sleep.

Blue light emitted by devices like smartphones and TVs mimics daylight and suppresses production of a brain chemical, melatonin, which helps us fall sleep

This type of light mimics daylight and suppresses production of a brain chemical called melatonin, which helps us fall sleep.

This is believed to be affecting the sleep quality of many Britons.

This is little surprise when the study, by Nytol, also revealed that 49 per cent of people go straight to bed after watching television, getting into bed less than 15 minutes after turning off the TV.

Dr Idzikowski added: ‘Sufferers should try and avoid using phones, laptops and other screen-based devices for at least an hour before bed.

‘Sometimes this is unavoidable, which is when apps which adapt blue light to its surroundings or a temporary sleep aid can be beneficial.’
