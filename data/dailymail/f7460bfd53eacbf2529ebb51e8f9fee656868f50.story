Julio Cesar is set to clinch a season-long loan move to Benfica this week after being deemed surplus to requirements at Queens Park Rangers.

The Brazilian is earning a staggering £100,000-a-week at Loftus Road and the club are keen to get the goalkeeper off the wage bill.

Cesar’s salary is a problem for the Portuguese side but they are likely to reach a compromise for the 34-year-old.

On the move: Benfica are set to sign Cesar, but still need to agree a compromise on his wages

Pedigree: Cesar played in all seven of Brazil's World Cup matches earlier this summer

Cesar signed for QPR in 2012 but has failed to settle in west London. The Champions League winner has been limited to just 24 appearances for The R's - and Rob Green is currently Harry Redknapp's first choice keeper.

The former Inter Milan keeper spent last season on loan at Toronto FC in the MLS, for whom he played just seven matches. 

Nevertheless, Cesar was still selected for Brazil's World Cup squad and played in all seven of their matches. 

Offloading Cesar would prove an important step for QPR as their owner, Tony Fernandes, is keen to cut the wage bill after the frivolities of his early tenure at the club.

Number one: Rob Green has usurped Julio Cesar as QPR's first choice goalkeeper

Budget: Harry Redknapp admitted that to add to his squad he would need to cut costs
