Drunk at school: Music teacher Neil Bowden drove back to school three times over the drink-drive limit after having lunch at a nearby pub

A high school teacher who drove back to school after a drunken pub lunch has been caught three times over the drink-drive limit.

Neil Bowden - a music teacher for eight years - quit his job at Trinity High School in Hulme, Manchester, after staff suspected he was under the influence when he returned from lunch at a pub just a couple of hundred yards from the school gates.

The 35-year-old from Stockport, Greater Manchester pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol at Manchester City Magistrates’ Court.

Tess Kenyon, prosecuting, told how the headteacher was waiting for Bowden when he drove into the school car park just after 2pm.

Staff had suspected Bowden was under the influence of drink before going to the Ducie Arms in Hulme, on June 5.

The court heard that several empty cider bottles were found in his car and Bowden had been drinking the night before and resumed drinking at 11 o’clock the next morning.

Bowden admitted he had driven to and from the nearby pub.

Believing that Bowden was drunk, the headteacher called police. A breath test showed he had 118 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the drink-drive limit is 35.

Bowden had fully co-operated with police and entered his guilty plea at the earliest opportunity, the court heard.

Peter Belshaw, defending, said his client had to accept that he may have been over the limit when he drove to work that morning. 

The court heard that prior to the incident he was a man of ‘unblemished reputation’.

Mr Belshaw said: ‘He wishes to express his deep remorse and contrition over what happened. He has always set for himself the highest professional standards.’

Bowden was given a 28-month driving ban, sentenced to carry out 80 hours of unpaid community work and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 surcharge.

After the hearing, Trinity head David Ainsworth said: ‘The situation happened at lunchtime.  Mr Bowden did not teach in the afternoon and the following day I accepted his resignation with immediate effect.’

In 2011, primary school teacher Penny Truman got so drunk on her lunch break that the headteacher thought she had suffered a stroke but paramedics who examined her found she was simply inebriated.

The teacher at a school in Putney, south-west London attempted to teach four and five-year-olds after downing an entire bottle of wine.

Malcolm West, a teacher entrusted with instructing pupils at a public school how to use firearms at a school in Kent, was charged after he drove into a garden wall while twice the drink-drive limit.
