The Metropolitan Police Commissioner admitted that the return of militarised jihadis to the streets of the UK posed a threat

At least five Britons a week are heading to Syria to fight for Islamic State terrorists, Britain’s top policeman has warned.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the true figure was likely to be far higher as officers cannot keep watch on all routes to the war zone.

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner admitted that the return of militarised jihadis to the streets of the UK posed a threat. More than 500 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria to fight, half of whom may have returned.

But police believe that number will leap by 50 per cent within a year, despite the deaths of up to 30 British jihadis in the fighting and outrage at IS’s beheading of British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines.

Sir Bernard told the National Security Summit in London: ‘Five a week doesn’t sound much but when you realise there are 50-odd weeks in a year, 250 more would be 50 per cent more than we think have gone already.

‘Those numbers are a minimum. There may be many more who set out to travel to another country and meandered over to Syria and Iraq in a way that is not always possible to spot when you have failed states and leaky borders.’

Sir Bernard has backed plans to hand police the power to seize passports if they suspect Britons are travelling abroad to fight with terror groups.

He also called for airlines to hand over passenger lists with much more notice.

Scotland Yard has seen its terrorist arrest rate rocket by 70 per cent in the past three years, with 218 suspects held so far this year. Cash seizures and interventions at borders are also up by 50 per cent. UK spy planes and armed drones will fly missions over Syria in a significant escalation of Britain’s involvement in the conflict, the Ministry of Defence announced yesterday.

RAF Reaper drones will be used to gather intelligence on the threat from IS after being redeployed from Afghanistan.

They will be used alongside Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft, a spy plane that carries sophisticated eavesdropping sensors. Although the unmanned drones are armed, their weapons will not be used in Syria, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon stressed.

The Government has ruled out military action in Syria without agreement from Parliament and the surveillance move may be seen by some MPs as ‘mission creep’.

An Islamic convert has mown down and killed a Canadian soldier in an attack feared to have been inspired by the murder of Lee Rigby.

A second soldier was injured by Ahmad Rouleau who called police afterwards to boast of what he had done. Rouleau, 25, drove off but was shot dead when he charged at officers.

The attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, near Montreal, appears similar to the murder of Drummer Rigby, who was run down and stabbed to death outside his barracks in London in May last year by two Muslim extremists.

The Pakistan Taliban have sacked their spokesman after he pledged allegiance to IS. His defection follows that of five commanders last week.
