The police chief leading the investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has accused the BBC of a ‘cover-up’ over how its journalists learned the star’s house would be raided.

The Corporation received 762 complaints over its live coverage of the raid, which related to a historic allegation of sexual abuse of a boy under 16.

The BBC has refused to reveal its source, but says it did not find out from South Yorkshire Police, which carried out the raid.

South Yorkshire Police sources claimed officers in the Metropolitan Police working on Operation Yewtree, investigating historical claims of sex abuse,  leaked details of the raid on Cliff Richard's house to the BBC

Last night South Yorkshire Police sources blamed staff working on Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police-led inquiry into historic sexual abuse, for the leak.

Yesterday the furious police chief leading the case accused the BBC of a ‘cover-up’ of the ‘improper and unauthorised’ way journalists had learned that officers were set to search Sir Cliff’s £3million home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, last Thursday. Chief constable David Crompton said he had complained to the BBC about an article on its website stating the force had deliberately attempted to ‘ensure maximum coverage’.

He added: ‘This appeared to be an attempt by the BBC to distance itself from what had taken place and cover up the fact that it had initiated contact with the force about the story.’

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, has summoned BBC director general Lord [Tony] Hall and South Yorkshire Police to face MPs on September 2. Yesterday Mr Crompton responded defiantly to questions by Mr Vaz, saying his force had only taken control of the investigation on July 3 – even though Scotland Yard had received an allegation of sexual assault last year.

Labour MP Keith Vaz has summoned BBC director general Tony Hall to parliament to answer questions 

He said the BBC rang South Yorkshire on July 14 with details ‘that mirrored the information held by my offices in almost every respect’ – even though only six members of South Yorkshire Police knew when the raid would take place.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘The suggestion that the source of this story being leaked to a media outlet was a member of the Metropolitan Police Service is one that we take seriously. An assessment will be made as to how this issue should best be progressed.’

Yesterday Sir Cliff, who has denied any wrongdoing, showed no signs of returning from holiday in Portugal, despite detectives saying they want to speak to him as soon as possible.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We have set out our position. The story was clearly in the public interest.’
