Bill Cosby was sued Tuesday by a Southern California woman who claims the comedian molested her in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion around 1974 when she was 15 years old.

Judy Huth's sexual battery lawsuit does not specify how much she is seeking from Cosby, who has in recent weeks faced renewed accusations that he drugged and sexually assaulted more than a dozen women for many years.

Huth's lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, however, is the first time that a woman has claimed she was underage when she was abused, and it is the first lawsuit Cosby has faced claiming sexual abuse since 2005.

New victim: A woman is suing Bill Cosby saying the he sexually assaulted her when she was just a teenager at the Playboy Mansion

Huth's lawsuit states that she and a 16-year-old friend first met Cosby at a Los Angeles-area film shoot and the comedian gave the girls drinks a week later at a tennis club.

The lawsuit says the three played billiards, with the girls having to drink a beer every time Cosby won a game.

The lawsuit then states that Cosby took them to the Playboy Mansion after several drinks, and told the teenagers to lie and say they were 19 years old if asked. 

Her lawsuit states Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him with his hand after she returned from the bathroom, with the actor waiting for her on a bed.

She also says he tried to put his hand down her pants. 

An email message sent to Cosby's attorney Martin Singer was not immediately returned. Singer has denied previous accusations or said the women raising the claims in interviews had been discredited.

Singer's statement does not apply to a lawsuit brought in 2005 by Andrea Constand, who claimed Cosby drugged and molested her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in 2004. 

Constand, who worked for the women's basketball team at Temple University, and Cosby settled the case before trial.

Cosby resigned from the university's board of trustees on Monday. He had been the school's public face, appearing in advertisements, fundraising campaigns and delivering commencement speeches. 

Cosby, 77, has never been criminally charged stemming from any of the sex-abuse allegations, many of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s.

Huth claims she suffered severe emotional distress and that she discovered its impact on her within the past three years, which allows her to file the lawsuit under California law.

'This traumatic incident, at such a tender age, has caused psychological damage and mental anguish for (Huth) that has caused significant problems throughout her life,' the lawsuit states. 

Interestingly enough, while Mark Whitaker’s biography of Bill Cosby made no mention of any of these allegations, it did talk about how Cosby was a frequent guest at the Playboy Mansion.

Cosby's laywer, Martin Singer,  released a statement last month calling recent rape allegations 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'completely illogical.'

'This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards,' says Singer.

'Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?'

He then closed by saying, 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.'

More than ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions.

Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time.

One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her.

Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them.

Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967.

What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room.

When asked to speak about these claims in an AP interview, Cosby said he had 'no response' and 'no comment.' 

These continued allegations are having a major impact on Cosby's work, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star.

TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network.
