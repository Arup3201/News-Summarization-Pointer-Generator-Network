Argentina's football chiefs have been fined £19,500 by FIFA after their players posed with a political banner laying claim to the Falkland Islands.

The players stood behind the slogan ‘Las Malvinas son Argentinas’ (the Falklands are Argentinian) at a June 7 friendly against Slovenia in Buenos Aires.

The world governing body opened disciplinary proceedings against the AFA last month following the controversial incident.

Controversial: The Argentina players posed with a banner which read: 'The Falkland Islands are Argentinian'

Not the first: Boca Juniors also posed with the banner ahead of a match against River Plate on March 30 2014

The message was displayed in support of an on-going campaign to claim sovereignty of the islands, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean.

A statement from FIFA said the AFA had been fined and issued with a reprimand after it was deemed to be in breach of Article 60 of the FIFA stadium safety and security regulations ('political action') and Article 52 of the FIFA disciplinary code ('team misconduct').

The AFA was notified of the terms of FIFA's decision on Friday.
