Roman Abramovich plans to knock three houses together to create a £100m home

Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has won a three-year battle with planners for permission to upgrade his £100million Thames-side home.

The 46-year-old tycoon aims to start work immediately linking the 17th century house to two adjacent properties.

His £10million plan to refurbish the mansion has been met with fury from neighbours who have described the proposal's approval as 'bad news'.

Estimates put the likely date for completion of the scheme to be at 
least three years away, but Chelsea Football Club owner Abramovich and 
his family will be elsewhere in London, far from the din as well as the 
uprooting of many trees on what was once an estate owned by Thomas More.

After months of a bitter planning battle with locals, Abramovich — 
acting behind the little-known Acmonious Investments — has been told 
that Kensington And Chelsea Council has decided to grant ‘conditional 
permission’ to develop the Grade II-listed building, once owned by the 
artist James Whistler and, more recently home to late Tory minister Paul
Channon.

One of the chief objectors, who fears the renovation will blot out views
of the Thames and create a chaotic building site, has informed other 
disgruntled residents: ‘It seems that basically the whole proposal will 
be approved. This is probably bad news for all of us.’

Particularly hard-hit will be residents of nearby apartments, whose 
complaints about losing their views of the Thames were airily dismissed 
in the committee’s report.

In answer to the objectors, the planners said: ‘There is no right to a view in planning legislation.

‘The proposed development would protect the appearance of the building, 
would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and
preserve the special architectural and historic interest of the listed 
building.’

Part of the building will be converted into an art studio to house artwork he has bought with his partner Dasha Zhukova

One member of the residents' committee said: 'The battle may be lost, 
but the war is far from over. We are not going to accept all this lying 
down and hope that some of the main preservation groups will get on side
when they see how genuine protest is being ridden over roughshod.’

The Chelsea Football Club owner decided to make the house in Chelsea his home after failing to gain permission to build an eight-bedroom house in nearby Belgravia.

His staff said yesterday that he aims to start work on the refurbishment project immediately after winning approval from Kensington & Chelsea Council's planning committee.

His new home is in a street where Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger owns a house. Fellow band member Keith Richards has also lived in the street.

The businessman aims to excavate beneath the Grade II-listed house, which was once home to artist James Whistler, to create a two-storey basement.

He is also going to convert part of the building into an art studio to house his collection of valuable modern paintings that he has bought along with his 31-year-old partner, Dasha Zhukova.

He has only won permission for the project after making a series of compromises, which were forced on him by neighbours anxious at possible loss of light and increased traffic.

One opponent, Dr Richard Clarke, 
warned the venture was 'totally out of character with the surrounding 
buildings on this famous historic site.'

He added: 'It will be an unsightly fortress-like building, spoiling the outlook for neighbours.'

Another neighbour Christopher Walker, said the scheme would 'severely damage the character and look of the house.'

But Mr Abramovich's architects promised planning officials the renovation would turn the property into 'a beautiful and meaningful contemporary home'.

He and his wife and three-year-old son Aaron are currently living in a Kensington house they own.

Three years ago, the businessman bought two adjacent buildings in Lowndes Square, London and revealed he aimed to turn them into a single eight-bedroom home.

But he had to abandon this venture as part of the complex was National Trust-owned and because of time delays.
