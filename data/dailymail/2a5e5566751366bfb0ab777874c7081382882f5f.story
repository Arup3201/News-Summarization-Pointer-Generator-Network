Horrifying: Luca died after being locked in a car for more than eight hours, when his father allegedly forgot to drop him at nursery

A two-year-old boy has died in Italy after being locked in a car for more than eight hours, when his father allegedly forgot to drop him at nursery.

Andrea Albanese, 39, went to his work in the northern Italian town of Piacenza as usual, not realising that his son Luca was still in the car, it is alleged.

More than eight hours later the toddler was found collapsed in the baking hot car, outside the restaurant where his father works as a chef.

He is thought to have been in the vehicle from eight in the morning to five in the afternoon, when the alarm was raised.

The little boy’s grandfather only realised something was wrong when he went to pick up his grandson from nursery, but found he was not there.

But by then it was too late and Luca was already dying of suspected suffocation, according to the Italian newspaper il Gazettino.

The heat in the car which is said to have reached 60 degrees Celsius, is also likely to have been a factor.

Witnesses said the horrified father 
screamed as he rushed to the car and found the infant close to death, 
local TV station Piacenza 24 reported.

Grief: A card left at the scene. The little boy¿s grandfather only realised something was wrong when he went to pick up his grandson from nursery, but found he was not there

Agony: Well-wishers tie flowers on to the railings. Witnesses said the horrified father screamed as he rushed to the car and found the infant close to death, local TV station Piacenza 24 reported

Tragic: Two-year-old Hezekiah Brooks was found dead last week after he apparently crawled into his grandfather's car in Pensacola, Florida.

As the emergency services rushed to the scene, colleagues bought water from vending machines, which Mr Albanese tried to give to the child.

But despite desperate attempts to revive him it was to no use.

The devastated father and his wife have been hospitalised and treated for shock.

Mr Albanese is under formal investigation for manslaughter.

Meanwhile prosecutors have ordered an autopsy to determine the cause of death.

A car without windows rolled down acts as a green house, as it takes only 10 minutes to raise the temperature in the car by 15 degrees.
