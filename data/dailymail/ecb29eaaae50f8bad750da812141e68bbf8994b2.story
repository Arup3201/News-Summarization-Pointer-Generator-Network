Mike Tyson has defended Luis Suarez for his bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini by claiming it was just 'the heat of the moment'.

Suarez has received worldwide criticism for the bite but former world heavyweight champion Tyson has shown his support for the Liverpool forward.

Tyson was involved in perhaps the most famous biting incident in sporting history when he took a chomp out of Evander Holyfield's right ear in a Las Vegas world title bout in 1997.

And in a Q & A with social media site Reddit he showed his support for the Uruguayan after he was handed a four-month ban by FIFA and a nine-game international suspension over the incident in the World Cup clash last month.

'I think it is just the heat of the moment, really hot blooded and really competitive,' said Tyson.

'The heat of the moment takes over us sometimes. We are really competitive and lose bad judgement in our thinking at these times. Sometimes you can just become highly frustrated.'

Tyson is not the only sportsman to come out in support of Suarez with international team-mate Diego Lugano backing striker while Uruguay president Jose Mujica also got behind him.

Suarez, despite this latest biting controversy - the third of his career - looks set to join Spanish giants Barcelona.
