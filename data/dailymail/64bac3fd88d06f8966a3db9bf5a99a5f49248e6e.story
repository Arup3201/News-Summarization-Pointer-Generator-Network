An obese New Yorker named in court as a Gambino gangster appeared on TV show The Biggest Loser hoping to shed some weight, it emerged today.

Two witnesses at the racketeering and murder trial of Bartolomeo (Bobby) Vernace claimed Robert Iovane, nicknamed Big Head, was a member of Vernace's mob.

In 2006 he featured in a special edition of the reality diet show when he teamed up with relatives who owned an Italian restaurant in the Bronx.

Joseph Gambina testified that Iovane engaged in illegal sports gambling and loansharking

A source revealed the 45-year-old had been laying low for a number of years, but his brush with fame didn't go unnoticed in Mob Land, the New York Daily News reported.

According to the witnesses, he was instantly recognised for being part of Vernace's crime crew which operated out of a Queens café.

Former Bonanno mobster Joseph (Giuseppe) Gambina told the court his criminal dealings with Iovane included illegal sports betting and loansharking.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Evan Norris asked him: 'Did you ever see him on TV?'

'Yes,' Gambina replied. 'I was watching TV at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning and I saw him on that show, The Big Fat Loser.'

Gambina said he was 'close' to Vernace, who's charged with the 1981 murders of two bar owners, Richard Godkin and John D’Agnese, allegedly killed over a spilled drink.

Iovane's alleged criminal activities occurred in the 1990s

Another mobster, Howard Santos, had testified previously that Iovane was a 'flashy guy' who ran an illegal poker game called Squeeze, the New York Daily News reported.

'I mean he would whip out stacks of money like this thick and show off,' Santos said.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Amir Toossi asked him how Iovane got his nickname.

'Because he's got a big head,' Santos said.

Iovane and another Gambino associate allegedly beat up a guy named Frank the Mechanic in 1999 but Santos couldn't recall why.

Iovane's alleged criminal activities occurred in the 1990s, but a source said he hasn't been around Vernace's place in years and dropped out of sight until appearing in the TV show.

He worked in the relatives' restaurant and also operated landscaping businesses in Queens and Long Island.

'He doesn't want to talk to nobody,' a man identifying himself as Iovane's brother told the New York Daily News before hanging up the phone.

In an interview for the NBC reality show, Iovane said his battle with a 'band of heart-attack fat strapped to his waist' once led him to handcuff himself to a treadmill.

'My client has never been involved in any criminal activity, or had knowledge of any criminal activity, at any time,' said lawyer Robert Jannuzzi.

'Whatever these witnesses are saying is completely fictitious. They're liars,' he said.
