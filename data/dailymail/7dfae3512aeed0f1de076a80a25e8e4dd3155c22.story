Jill Duggar and her new husband Derick Dillard shared their first ever kiss during their wedding in front of 1,000 of their closest friends and family members. The wedding, which took place on June 21, was aired on a special episode of 19 Kids and Counting last night.

After the happy couple were pronounced husband and wife at the Cross Church in Springdale, Arkansas, family patriarch Jim Bob Duggar was the one to say: 'Derick, you may kiss the bride.'

'It was so cute - I thought Jill almost dove right into the moment,' the bride’s mother Michelle said after the ceremony.

'I was really surprised, but on the other hand, I'm not. I just think Jill is quite the enthusiastic person,' she added.

Derick, 25, said the kiss was his favorite part of the much-anticipated day.

'My favorite part of the ceremony was when we were officially Mr and Mrs Dillard - and kissing,' he said.

Michelle praised her daughter and son-in-law for waiting until the wedding to kiss each other.

'It's hard, because it takes a lot of self-control,' she said. 'But they're also very wise and they had a lot of accountability to help them get to the marriage altar and save that first kiss for their wedding day.' 

The devout Christian couple, who held hands throughout the ceremony, also lit a candle symbolizing their unity.

'Before God, as a married couple, we're one person,' Derick explained.

Family tradition: The couple chose to follow in Jill's parents' footsteps by holding their nuptials at the same church where Jim Bob and Michelle were married 30 years ago - and even used the same vows

One tradition the couple chose not to follow was the groom's custom of waiting for the wedding to see the bride in her dress.

Jill decided to show Derick her custom-designed Allure Romance gown shortly before the ceremony, with the groom becoming quite overwhelmed at the sight of his beautiful bride to be.

'Babe, you look absolutely amazing,' he said. 'I've never seen you so gorgeous.'

Jim Bob, who introduced his daughter to Derick after meeting him while doing missionary work abroad, was particularly moved by the union.

Proud papa: 'Your whole life, you invest in your daughter and then one day you give her away,' said Jill's father, Jim Bob

'Your whole life, you invest in your daughter and then one day you give her away,' he said. 'It's kind of a happy and sad time, and I just can't put it into words.'

The couple chose to follow in Jill's parents' footsteps by holding their nuptials at the same church where Jim Bob and Michelle were married 30 years ago - and even used the same vows. 

'I pledge here and now this solemn vow. With this ring I thee wed. With loyal love I thee endow, so long as I shall live,' both repeated. 

Carried away: Derick gives his new bride a lift right after the wedding ceremony

The couple are now expecting their first child, and recently revealed that they're having a boy after learning the gender from an ultrasound.

'I was really excited,' Derick told People, adding, 'As a new dad, to have a firstborn son to be our first child and be the leader of his siblings, it is very special.'

The couple are due to have their baby in March 2015.

Breaking the rules: One tradition the couple chose not to follow was the groom's custom of waiting for the wedding to see the bride in her dress

The couple married less than three months after Derick proposed to Jill, who told Us Weekly that they purposely kept their engagement short so as not to tempt themselves into being unchaste before the wedding.

The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's 17 and Counting, a series that followed the lives of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17 - now 19 - children.

They are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement, which 'teaches that children are God's blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.'
