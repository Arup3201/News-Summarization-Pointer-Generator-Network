They split in November after three years of dating and almost a year of being engaged.

But on Saturday Robin Wright, 48, and Ben Foster, 34, looked very much back together as they held hands while walking through LAX airport in Los Angeles. The Forrest Gump star even had a ring on her wedding finger which was most likely her engagement jewelry.

This comes just weeks after her ex-husband Sean Penn reportedly got 'secretly engaged' to his girlfriend Charlize Theron.

Back in love?: Robin Wright was seen holding hands with her ex Ben Foster at LAX airport in Los Angeles on Saturday just two months after she called off their engagement

When they were engaged: Wright and Foster at the Golden Globe awards in January 2014

Foster and Wright looked very in sync as they wore matching attire.

Not only did they have the same aviator sunglasses on, but they also wore similar jeans and worn-in brown boots. The two also both had on cross body luggage.

In November, UsWeekly reported the couple ended their 10-month engagement.

'She got swept up in the engagement last Christmas, but then their schedules got crazy and she realized it wasn't the right decision,' a source told the publication.

The couple's age difference - she is 14 years older - was cited as a major issue.

The ex-wife of  Penn felt as if Ben was just 'too immature,' it was claimed.

'The gap just ended up being too much,' an insider revealed. 'Ben was kind of immature. She couldn't deal with him anymore.'

And the couple - they met on set of their 2011 film Rampart - were also working in separate cities, which created an emotional distance.

Robin was shooting the Netflix show House of Cards in Baltimore while Ben was in London doing A Streetcar Named Desire on stage.

During her downtime, Wright liked to visit her children - Dylan, 23, and Hopper Jack, 21 (their father is Penn) - in Los Angeles.

Before Sean, who she wed in 1996 and divorced in 2010, Robin was married to Dane Witherspoon.

Meanwhile, Penn (who was once wed to Madonna) directed his 39-year-old love Theron in the love story The Last Face in South Africa in 2014. Javier Bardem and Jean Reno also star.

In December UsWeekly reported Penn and Theron were 'secretly engaged' but he had yet to buy her a ring. 

In August model Dylan, who used to date Robert Pattinson, said of her father and the bombshell: 'They're a great couple. They're both very happy and, yeah, I love it.'

She added, 'They're both extremely strong personalities and they're very intelligent, so conversation lasts between them.'

In February 2014 Robin broke her silence on her divorce from Sean.

The Forrest Gump star told a British paper, 'Divorce in and of itself, and with children, is devastating. Worse than that.

'One of the reasons why we got back together and broke up so much was trying to keep the family together. If you've got kids, it's a family, and you try again, and you try again. We did that for a long time.'
