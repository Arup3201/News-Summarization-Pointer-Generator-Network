Rolling Stone magazine is in trouble with its readers who are outraged over the forthcoming August 3 issue which features Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover.

The image is a self-taken portrait of Tsarnaev in which he looks more like a rock star than a terrorist. He is identified simply as ‘The Bomber’ and the article promises to explain ‘how a popular, promising student was failed by his family, fell into radical Islam, and became a monster.’

The use of Tsarnaev as a cover star has caused an instant backlash on social media, with more than 2,500 people leaving angry comments on the magazine’s Facebook page.

Rolling Stone magazine has been accused of glamorizing Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev by featuring him on its cover

Almost all the comments express anger and displeasure at the choice of the alleged bomber and a large number of commenters have threatened to cancel their subscriptions.

This isn’t the first time this particular image has been used in the media since the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing, which Tsarnaev stands accused of carrying out with his brother, Tamerlan. The photo appeared on the front page of The New York Times in May.

However the cover of Rolling Stone is typically occupied by rock stars and actors, and many feel the cover is glorifying Tsarnaev, who is accused of killing three people and wounding more than 260.

The decision to go with the bombing suspect has been widely lambasted as tasteless. Comments left on the magazine Facebook page have include:

Rolling Stone readers have complained on social media platforms about how the image of Tsarnaev is tasteless and makes him look like a rock star

‘Very un-American. F**k you Rolling Stone. I thought it was supposed to be an honor to be on your cover?’

'Whoever subscribes to this worthless rag should cancel their subscriptions TODAY!!! This is unacceptable!!

'I shared this on my news feed, but not in support of your magazine, I shared it to show people how low you have gone by putting this terrorist on your cover. Rolling Stone, go and read all the shares of your picture, there are a lot of angry people that you would make such a disgusting choice.'

On Twitter people have commented about said the picture of Tsarnaev looks similar to an old cover featuring Jim Morrison of The Doors.

'This cover makes him look like some kind of cool rock god... it's horrible' said another commentary on the magazine’s Facebook feed.

Why give the guy the cover of Rolling Stone? TIME gave Charles Manson the cover and all the magazines carried pictures of the Columbine shooters on the covers, too. Don't make martyrs out of these people.'

Tsarnaev, who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Massachusetts, has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four killings - associated with the bombing

Tsarnaev has already attracted a gaggle of female supporters organized as the ‘Free Jahar’ movement who have posted comments on social media sites expressing their love for him.

This isn’t the first time the magazine has featured a notorious figure on its cover, murderer Charles Mason was featured back in June 1970.

The cover story itself claims to be an in-depth life and times of the bomber which Rolling Stone contributing editor Janet Reitman spent two months researching.

She interviewed dozens of sources including childhood and high school friends, teachers, neighbors and law enforcement agents, many of whom spoke for the first time about the case.

The magazine claims that the article reveals a lot of new information, including five revelations about Tsarnaev.

As he lay in the boat, surrounded by SWAT teams and police, FBI negotiators mentioned a public plea for his surrender from his former wrestling coach.

An agent on the scene later told the coach that it could have been this name from the past – and the memory of that past – both of which were invoked during the standoff, that convinced Tsarnaev to ultimately give up.

Tragedy: The April 15 bombings at the Boston Marathon killed three people and wounded more than 260

Around 2008, his older brother Tamerlan confided to his mother that he felt like 'two people' were inside him.

She confided this to a close friend who felt he might need a psychiatrist, but Zubeidat believed that religion would be the cure for her son’s inner demons and growing mental instability, and pushed him deeper into Islam.

Tsarnaev's high school, Cambridge Rindge and Latin, is famously diverse, but he played down the fact that he was a Muslim.

As his brother and mother became more religious, he did, however, attend a small Friday prayer group that met at lunchtime, and once got quite upset when a friend who'd converted to Islam talked about it in a casual way.

‘Islam wasn't casual to Tsarnaev’ says one friend. ‘He took his religion seriously.’

Tsarnaev shared few details of his troubled home life with even his closest friends. In the months leading up to the bombing, his family had disintegrated. His parents were both living in Russia.

His two older sisters were estranged. Only Tamerlan, who was becoming increasingly devout and judgmental of all non-Muslims, was still in Boston.

When one of Tsarnaev’s friends asked to meet Tamerlan, but he said, ‘No, you don't want to meet him.’

Tsarnaev never spoke about 9/11. Once, though, he let slip to a high school friend that he thought the terrorist attacks could be justified, and pointed to US policies towards Muslim countries and US drone strikes and other attacks as his rationale.

Tsarnaev, who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Massachusetts, pleaded not guilty last week to 30 counts associated with the bombing.
