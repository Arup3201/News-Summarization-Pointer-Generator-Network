Arrested: Michelle Strickland, 23 (pictured), has been charged with an improper relationship with the 18-year-old student

A Texas band teacher has been accused of having sex with one of her students in a storage room at their school.

Michelle Strickland, 23, has been charged with having an improper relationship with the 18-year-old student.

According to a police investigation, 
the assistant band director and the teen would disappear into a room  in the band 
hall of Houston's Stratford High School where they would have oral sex.

They also had sex at the student's home over the spring break and sent each other explicit text messages.

Police began investigating the improper relationship in April after receiving an anonymous tip off, according to KTRK TV in Houston.

The
 principal told investigators he reviewed the student's phone 
communication between the teen and the teacher that suggested an ongoing
 sexual relationship.

Strickland, who joined the school in the 2013-2014 year, was removed from the classroom. She was later dismissed.

Spring
 Branch Police Chief Chuck Brawner said the student involved had 
admitted to having a sexual relationship with the teacher.

'The student admitted to it. She denied it,' he said.

Chief Brawner also said they had obtained explicit text messages sent between the pair during the course of the affair.

Parents of
 other students at the school were sent a detailed message by the 
principal outlining the details of Strickland's arrest.

The
 statement said: 'Spring Branch ISD's number one priority will always be
 the safety of our students. We will take swift and decisive action 
against any employee who ever endangers a student.

'This
 type of behavior will never be tolerated in Spring Branch ISD. The bond
 of trust between our parents and students and the employees of the 
school district is critically important.
