Graduate students have used a 3D printer to make a limb for a six-year-old boy born without a right arm.

Alex Pring, from Groveland, Florida, was given the new prosthetic arm on Friday by a team headed by University of Central Florida student Albert Manero.

The limb took seven weeks for the team to build in their free time and cost $350 - compared to the $40,000 that doctors told Alex's family a prosthetic arm would cost.

After the little boy put on the arm, which senses muscles in his shoulder and opens and closes, he grinned and gave his mother a hug - the first time he had been able to put two arms around her.

New possibilities: Six-year-old Alex Pring, who was born without a right arm, speaks with Albert Manero, a University of Central Florida student who built Alex a prosthetic arm with a 3D printer

Getting ready: The engineering students can be seen hooking up the boy's new arm last week

'I feel good,' Alex told reporters. 'I feel everything good, even my robot arm. It's not even heavy.'

The team started building the arm after Manero, an aerospace engineering PhD student, began thinking about how to help the family after reading a letter Alex's mother posted online.

On a website for a community devoted to making prosthetic hands, Alyson Pring that because her son had been born without an arm, their insurance company wouldn't cover the costs.

The costs are so steep for childhood prosthetics because of their quick rate of growth and the need to always be replacing the limbs.

Manero was driving his car when he heard a story on the radio about a man in South Africa who used a 3D printer to make a new hand.

'I was really inspired,' he said. 'When I got back, I talked to my colleagues and friends and said, "We can do this".'

First hug: Afterwards, the first thing Alex did was run to his mother for his first ever hug with two arms

Trying it out: Alex shakes hands with a reporter after receiving the new limb on Friday. His family had struggled to afford the $40,000 that doctors said it would cost to give the boy an arm

Getting used to it: Alex plays with a ball next to his grandfather after getting the arm, which reacts to muscles in his shoulder. He can open and close the hand and the battery lasts for a whole day

The team - including friends who study electrical, 
mechanical and civil engineering - got to work on the arm, which is activated by the electromyography muscle 
energy on Alex's bicep, UCFToday reported.

By July, they had a large working prototype and they then got to work on making a smaller version.

While the batteries can be bought from stores, Stratasys, one of the biggest commercial 3D printer makers in the 
nation, also donated some of the supplies.

'My mother taught us that we’re supposed to help change 
the world,' Manero said. 'We’re supposed to
 help make it better. That's why we did it. The look on Alex’s face when
 he used it for the first time was priceless.'

He added that the boy seemed to get used to the arm pretty quickly.

'The first thing he did when he could actually control it a little bit 
was hug his mother,' he said. 'He said it was their first real hug. There wasn't a 
dry eye in the room.'

Life changing: Alex is pictured grinning with his new arm with Manero, who came up with the idea

Thankful: Moreno, pictured hugging Alex, is now developing another printed arm for a second family

When he out-grows the arm, it'll cost just $20 for a new hand and $40 to 
$50 for a new forearm.

Manero later put the plans of the design online so that others could download them for free and improve them.

'I have no doubt that the international community will try to move this technology forward and lower the cost,' he said.

Manero, a 
Fulbright Scholar, heads to Germany in August to work for the German 
Aerospace Center, but he has already promised to help another family 
with an arm, so he'll remain committed to the project even when he's 
abroad.

'I think 3D printing is revolutionizing our world in 
many ways,' he said. 'I believe changing the world of prosthetics is very real. 
There's no reason why this approach shouldn’t work on adults too.'
