The City of Dallas has begun tearing down a run-down building where Lee Harvey Oswald briefly lived before the 
assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

The uninhabited 10-unit, 
two-story apartment complex was condemned in November 2012 after a four-year battle over code violations.

Now the bulldozers have moved in to raze the building in the same year that Dallas is officially commemorating the killing for the first time. President Kennedy was shot on November 22 1963.

Owner Jane Bryant was emotional about seeing the building being demolished. She told the LA Times that she hadn't known that the process had begun until she was informed by a reporter.

'The city of Dallas told me if I was 
making progress on the building, they would stop it,' Bryant said. 
'They agreed to give me more time.'

The owner had been trying to salvage the valuable and historic parts of the building that was built in 1925. She believed she had around two weeks left.

Bryant has already sold the toilet and bathtub from Oswald's old apartment but wanted to remove the old pine and white oak from the property.

Crumbling: The disheveled apartment was uninhabited and had a number of building code violations.

She told the LA 
Times that she was trying to contact her lawyer to file a restraining 
order to stop the demolition, and that police on Monday had refused to 
let her into the building.

Bryant
was worried that scavengers would begin to break up the building as it 
was being taken down by the city 'People are going to be in there 
tonight stealing,' she said.

Bryant
was never able to realize her plans to renovate the building in the Oak
Cliff area of Dallas after buying it in 2007, and the next year got 
caught up in litigation with the city over the state of the building at 
600 Elsbeth St.

'We're not just losing a piece
of fundamental history to Dallas related to the assassination, we're 
also losing a piece of fundamental architecture to this area,' said 
Bryant.

Demolition begins on the 1925 apartment building

The apartment, where Oswald 
lived from November 1962 to March 1963 with his wife, Marina, and young 
daughter, is mentioned in the Warren Commission report, which 
investigated the president's death. The report concluded that Oswald 
acted alone on Nov. 22, 1963, when he fired at Kennedy's motorcade from 
the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, as it passed by 
Dealey Plaza.

Oswald then killed Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit 45 minutes after Kennedy was shot, according to the report.

Oswald was arrested in the hours after the assassination, but was killed two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby.

The
apartment where Oswald lived had the address of 604 Elsbeth St. in 
1963. It was apartment No. 2. The residence was one of several in the 
area where he lived after returning to the U.S. from Russia in June 
1962.

Oswald lived in apartment number 2. The building's owner has sold off a number of things from his home, including the toilet

He can't hold a job for very long. He's
moving around quite a bit, can't get settled, breaks off relations with
his brother and mother soon after coming back. He goes from Fort Worth 
to Dallas to New Orleans, back to Dallas, basically," said Max Holland, 
author of "The Kennedy Assassination Tapes."

David
Preziosi, executive director of Preservation Dallas, noted that there 
are more important buildings associated with Oswald than the Elsbeth 
Street apartment, including the boarding house where he was staying the 
day of the assassination and the Texas Theatre, where Oswald was 
arrested.

After leaving the Elsbeth Street 
apartment, Oswald moved a few blocks away, to Neely Street - where the 
famous pictures were taken of him posing in the backyard holding the 
rifle used in the assassination. He was living at a boarding house in 
the same area but on Beckley Avenue when Kennedy was assassinated.

Gary
Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, said Oswald 
ordered the revolver that killed Tippit in January, when he was living 
at the Elsbeth apartment, but notes that 'the most important parts of 
the Oswald story are what he did, not where he did them.'

'One
has to draw the line somewhere at what is or is not historically 
significant. For those studying Oswald's life, this may be a more 
important address, but for those who are curious about the Kennedy 
assassination, what actually happened in Dealey Plaza is of far more 
significance,' Mack said.

Bryant didn't know 
of the site's link to history until the year after she bought it. After a
local television station did a piece the building she had dreams of 
renovating, people got in contact to let her know of the Oswald 
connection.

She notes that the building has 
been a point of interest, adding that she'd had tourists from overseas 
come by the complex on Thanksgiving.
