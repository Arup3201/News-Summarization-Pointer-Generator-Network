A Welsh rugby club has club has caused a scrum online after they tweeted a photo of their team members running naked.

Mumbles RFC, a feeder club for the Ospreys based near Swansea, posted the picture in what seems to be an unfortunate blend of marketing strategy and rugger 'banter.'

The Twitter account describes the club 
as 'a rugby club for big strong boys, who look good and smell nice' and 
has more than 750 followers.

Showing off their tackle: A group of players from Mumbles RFC jump off their coach and run along the street naked as part of the club's initiation ceremony

The photo appears to show six members of
the team running naked along the side of a road in front of a large 
coach without a stitch of clothing between them save their socks and 
trainers.

It was taken during what has been described as an initiation ceremony to mark the start of the new season and accompanied by the words: 'Senior initiations #blueblood.'

Although some runners can be seen using their hands to protect their modesty others appear more relaxed about letting it all hang out and look as though they are simply enjoying a good training run.

The naked tweet was hastily deleted yesterday but not before being shared all across the internet and making it onto local news sites.

'Initiations' of new team mates have long been an integral part of most rugby clubs with some of the more disgusting ones only occasionally making it into the media.

Most are considered a bit of fun and are held strictly behind closed doors but typically they involve a heavy drinking and a certain level of ritualistic humiliation

Mumbles RFC: 'A rugby club for big strong boys, who look good and smell nice'

In 2011 England star Chris Ashton revealed how as a new member of the squad he too had been required undergo 'initiation.'

After his debut in a match against France he was ordered to sink an alcoholic drink with every member of the 22-strong squad in just a couple of hours.

The result, he admitted, left him 'battered' but pales in comparison with the antics of some amateur sides who evidently devote more time to planning their drinking than their match play.

In 2011 a group of six students from the University of Gloucestershire were caught ‘performing sex acts’ on the top of a bus as part of the club initiation ceremony.

Their debauchery was witnessed by members of the public including teenage girls and resulted in all six being given 160 day long community orders banning them from entering pubs or bars and from drinking in public.

In a similar instance the rugby club at De Montfort University in Leicester was charged by the sport's governing body, the Rugby Football Union, following the discovery that players were being forced play naked and blindfolded and jump into a paddling pool filled with urine.
