Veteran endurance swimmer Diana Nyad has defended her 110-mile record feat from Cuba to Florida after sceptics questioned whether she got into or held on to a boat during part of the journey.

Ms Nyad, 64, said she swam without holding on to any of the boats or people accompanying her. 'I swam. We made it, our team, in squeaky-clean, ethical fashion,' she said.

Her critics are suspicious about long stretches of the 53-hour swim where Ms Nyad appeared to have either picked up incredible speed or to have gone without food or drink.

Since Ms Nyad finished her swim on 
September 2 in Key West, long-distance swimmers have been debating it on
social media and in online forums.

Her
speed, at some points more than doubling, has drawn particular 
scrutiny. Her team has attributed her speed to the fast-moving Gulf 
Stream flowing in her favour.

The
athlete and her team held a conference call with some of the sceptics 
who questioned her navigator's credentials and observations of the 
currents.

'Many of us 
are pursuing this as a technical matter,' said kayaker and lawyer 
Richard Clifford.

'Having the information out there helps us analyse it,
measure it, test it, smell it, you know, decide if it looks right and 
is right, and you guys keep saying it is. So, let us look at it.' 

GPS: Nyad's navigator said the above 'spot trackers' used by her critics to claim she cheated are not accurate

A helping push: Nyad's claim that she was helped by a particularly swift current towards Key West has been backed up by independent ocean expert Dr Mitchell Roffer

Ms
Nyad's navigator, John Bartlett, said her fastest speed averaged about 
3.97mph over a 5.5-hour period over about 19 miles, crossing the 
strongest parts of the Gulf Stream, which was flowing at a favourable 
angle.

'What you're seeing 
is the combination of the speed of Diana propelling herself in the water
and the speed of the current carrying us across the bottom,' he said.

Bartlett said Nyad’s speed and 
location can’t be measured by ‘spot trackers’ - that were quoted by the 
doubters - were simply estimating Niyad’s location for public viewing 
and nothing more. 

He told MailOnline: ‘Those spot trackers are for the public to watch Diana swim along. The positions that I have on my GPS are the real positions,'

Evan
Morrison, co-founder of the online Marathon Swimmers Forum, says it 
will be interesting to compare observations made by Ms Nyad's navigator 
with publically available data about the currents she swam.

Ms
Nyad attempted the swim from Cuba to Florida four times before finally 
completing the journey on her fifth attempt, making her the first to 
make it without the aid of a shark cage.

Secret weapon: This is Nyad's first attempt using the prosthetic face mask custom-made to shield her from the paralyzing stings of the box jellyfish, which some fellow swimmers consider to be cheating

She
did follow a streamer dangled in the water by her team and used a 
specialised mask and bodysuit to protect herself from venomous 
jellyfish, which are considered a more serious threat than sharks in 
those waters.

Some members of the marathon swimming communities say 
these methods were against the traditions of her sport.

Nyad wore a full non-neoprene bodysuit, 
gloves, booties and a silicone mask at night, when jellyfish are a 
particular problem, and removed the suit once she got over the reef on 
her approach to Key West.

More than just encouraging words? Some other swimmers say that an uptick in her speed mid race implies that she may have gotten a boost of oxygen from her team

An oceanographer not affiliated with Nyad's team said the swimmer couldn't have picked a more perfect current to get from Havana to Key West.

Dr. Mitch Roffer of Roffer's Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service Inc. based in Melbourne, Fl. said he got an email questioning whether Nyad's swim was a hoax, so he decided to look at the charts for himself. What he saw convinced him that she could do it.

‘It was like a walking sidewalk heading to Key West and then got off it ,’ Roffer told MailOnline. ‘I looked at the GPS locations and they all seem to be correct. She got great benefit from the current.’

Janet Hinkle, a Key West boat captain and acquaintance of Nyad's, was called to be an observer for the swim when Steve Munatones, a former U.S. national open-water coach, was unable to make it. 'I can say unequivocally she swam every stroke without question,' Hinkle said.

Critics have said Hinkle was too close to Nyad to be an independent observer of her swim. Hinkle has in the past helped Nyad by providing housing for her when the swimmer stayed in the Florida Keys, but she said she remained on the periphery of Nyad's team.

'I think anyone who knows me knows me as a person of high integrity. I believe that's why Diana asked me, and I took my job very seriously,' Hinkle said. 'She was giving her all and I would give her my best.'

Since none of the various open-water swimming associations dictate how someone should swim from Cuba to Florida - officially accomplished only by Nyad and Susie Maroney, who used a shark cage - Nyad just had to follow generally accepted rules about not getting out of the water or using equipment such as fins.
