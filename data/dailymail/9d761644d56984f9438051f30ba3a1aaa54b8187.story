Apple has been granted a
patent for a wearable camera that could take on GoPro. 

The patent cites specific weaknesses in GoPro's
cameras, includes details about a camera system that can be
mounted on bike helmets or scuba masks far more easily.

Apple's newly patented camera system can also be used underwater to take pictures and record sounds, according to the application.

The patent, which cites specific weaknesses in GoPro'scameras, includes details about a camera system that can be mounted on bike helmets or scuba masks.

Shares of GoPro, whose cameras can be mounted on helmets,
surf boards, bikes and dog harnesses, fell as much as 15
percent.

A potential entry by the iPhone maker into the action camera
market could also put pressure on privately held Polaroid Corp,
which makes the small and colourful Cube cameras.

JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna, however, said it was
premature to assume that Apple would soon launch a wearable
camera.

'It does not seem to me that launching an action camera
accessory is the most logical product extension for Apple to
pursue right now,' Gauna said.

Apple declined to comment, while GoPro was not immediately
available for comment.

'I think that it will have about the same impact on GoPro as
the iPhone has had on camera makers and that impact is that
there are fewer cameras sold but the number isn't zero,' Wedbush
Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.

Videos shot with GoPro's cameras have created a buzz on the
Internet, attracting millions of views on YouTube.

Olympic gold medal winning snow boarder Shaun White and
11-time world champion surfer Kelly Slater are among well-known
athletes who have endorsed the cameras.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications

Later this year Apple will release it's much anticipated.

The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.'

Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen.

Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches.

The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom.

Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications.

It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.

Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them.

There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji.

Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. 

Intellectual property blog Patently Apple reported earlier
in the day that Apple's patent, which was filed by the company
in 2012, incorporates some intellectual property from Eastman
Kodak Co that the company acquired in November 2013.

With Tuesday's decline, GoPro shares are now down 51 percent
since their high of $98.47 last October. Still, the stock is up
73 percent since its IPO last June.

'We look at it as a buying opportunity at JMP, because what
we saw out of the Consumer Electronics Show at Las Vegas last
week is that GoPro remains the undisputed leader in the action
capture device category,' Gauna said.

GoPro shares were down 11.8 percent at $50.10, while Apple
was up 1.37 percent at $110.76 in late-afternnon trading on the
Nasdaq on Tuesday.
