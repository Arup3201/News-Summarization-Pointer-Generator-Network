In January 2003 Swansea City were five points adrift at the bottom of the Football League, fast forward 12 years and they've sold their star striker Wilfried Bony to the Premier League champions for £25million - rising to £28m depending on his success on leaving the Liberty Stadium.

The Welsh club's meteoric rise has seen them move from the brink of the amateur game to mixing with some of Europe's finest sides in the Europa League. 

From their days in League Two to their League Cup success, Sportsmail takes a look back at the Swans' remarkable journey.

Managers: Nick Cusack, Brian Flynn 

Finished: 21st in Third Division

By mid-January 2003, Swansea were five points behind Carlisle United at the bottom of the Third Division (now League Two) after a run of six successive defeats. Non-League football beckoned.

Their quest for safety went down to the final day of the season when a 4-2 victory at home to Hull lifted them one point ahead of the relegation zone and began a remarkable rise to the top of English football. 

2003-04 

Managers: Brian Flynn, Alan Curtis, Kenny Jackett

Finished: 10th in Third Division

The following campaign started brightly for the Swans, but with the play-offs and possible promotion on the horizon the club fell victim to a woeful run of results. 

They suffered six defeats in their last eight matches, eventually leaving them 10th in the table.

Manager: Kenny Jackett

Finished: Third in League Two

 The club's final season at Vetch Field, the stadium they had occupied since 1912, brought their first trophy in four years.

Swansea won the FAW Premier Cup and, but for two defeats in their last five matches, could have finished the season as champions. They eventually finished third, three points behind first-placed Yeovil Town.

2005-06 

Manager: Kenny Jackett

Finished: Sixth in League One 

The Liberty Stadium opened in the summer of 2005 and with it came another impressive season. 

Another FAW Premier Cup success was followed by a stellar first season in League One. After a considerable amount of time spent at the top of the table, the Swans were once again let down by some disappointing late-season form. 

After winning just five of 20 league matches in the second half of the campaign, Swansea  finished sixth. Defeat to Barnsley in the play-offs ensured another season in England's third tier.

There was some consolation for the club's supporters, though, after they triumphed in the Football League Trophy.

Manager: Kenny Jackett

Finished: Seventh in League One 

The following season saw, at last, a level of consistency from Swansea, and they were unlucky to miss out on a play-off place in May.

They finished seventh in the table after a 6-3 defeat at home by Blackpool on the final day of the season.

2007-08 

Managers: Kenny Jackett, Kevin Nugent, Roberto Martinez

Finished: League One winners

It was a case of third time lucky for Swansea as they finally earned promotion to the Championship in 2008.

Jason Scotland scored 24 goals as they ran away with the title, finishing 10 points clear of second-placed Nottingham Forest.

2008-09 

Manager: Roberto Martinez

Finished: Eighth in the Championship 

Scotland impressed again for the Swans in what would be his final season with the Welshmen.

His 21 goals helped them finish eighth in the Championship and earned him a £2m move to Wigan - breaking the record for Swansea's largest ever transfer fee received.

2009-10 

Manager: Paulo Sousa

Finished: Seventh in the Championship 

Despite selling their star striker, Sousa guided Swansea to a seventh-placed finish in the Championship, missing out on the play-offs by just one point.

In the absence Scotland's efforts up front, it was their defence that really excelled. They ended the season having conceded just 12 goals at home - fewer than any other team in the league.

Manager: Brendan Rodgers

Finished: Third in the Championship 

After Cardiff's numerous near-misses, Swansea became the first Welsh club to win promotion to the Premier League.

City finished third in the Championship and then won promotion through the play-offs. They beat Nottingham Forest in the semi-finals before Scott Sinclair scored a hat-trick against Reading in the final to complete their journey from the bottom to the top of professional football. 

2011-12 

Manager: Brendan Rodgers

Finished: 11th in the Premier League 

After a difficult start that saw Swansea fail to win any of their four opening fixtures in the Premier League, they established themselves as a formidable force.

They paid a club-record £3.5m for Danny Graham, who slotted seamlessly into the side, scoring 14 goals in all competitions.

Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool all fell victim to Rodgers' impressive, tactically astute side, who finished 11th in the table.

2012-13 

Manager: Michael Laudrup 

Finished: Ninth in the Premier League 

Rodgers' departure to Liverpool left many suggesting Swansea were destined for relegation, but the club again proved their doubters wrong and achieved arguably the greatest success in their history.

The club also sold star players Sinclair and Joe Allen to Manchester city and Liverpool respectively for a combined £23m.

But Michu took the Premier League by storm, scoring 18 goals as Michael Laudrup guided the club to a top-half finish. 

They also won the League Cup, beating Bradford City 5-0 in the final and booking their place in the Europa League.

2013-14 

Managers: Michael Laudrup, Garry Monk 

Finished: 12th in the Premier League 

The club reinvested the money received the previous season as they splashed out a club-record£12m for Ivorian Wilfried Bony.

But Swansea's European commitments took a toll on the club and indifferent form saw them just two points off the relegation places in February. 

Laudrup was removed as manager and Garry Monk took over. Monk brought stability to the side and they finished 12th in the table.

2014-15 

Manager: Garry Monk

Monk started the season strongly, beating Manchester United 2-1 in their opening game. 

The club received a record fee of £25m (rising to £28m) for star-striker Bony in January as the Ivorian moved to champions Manchester City.
