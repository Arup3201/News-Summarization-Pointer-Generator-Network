All to often we go about our lives without taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of our surroundings.

But these spectacular images show the true beauty of Britain's wildlife, which is often right in our back garden.

Submitted as part of a wildlife photography competition, the pictures of water voles, foxes, otters and stoats are enough to make you want to head out and explore the beauty of the British countryside.

The pictures in the fourth Native and Natural photo contest include a fox sleeping on a sunny day, a water vole hiding in a hole and a snake with its mouth wide open.

The contest was run by the British Wildlife Centre which is home to more than 40 different native species and challenged photographers to show the personalities of the animals they look after.

Head keeper Matt Binstead said: 'As always the competition resulted in an impressive selection of images.

'The shortlist was chosen not only to showcase the best photographs from these, but also to reflect the lives and personalities of the wonderful animals we have here at the British Wildlife Centre.'

The competition attracted more than 600 entries and other shots show a Muntjac in the spring sunshine by Zena Saunders, a fox hiding in the long grass by Sue MacCallum-Stewart and a cheeky water vole looking for food by Philip Pound.

Clair Wright has photographed a rare red squirrel running, whilst Joyce Flower pictured two wildcats playing together.

Kevin Brown cleverly captured the moment a butterfly landed on a fox's nose and Steff Morris shows a badger having a bath.

A spokesman for the British Wildlife Centre said: 'The British Wildlife Centre is known for providing wonderful photographic conditions for shots that would take patience and lots of luck to achieve in the wild!

'Animal welfare is our top priority. Our animal residents are housed in large natural enclosures, landscaped to reflect wild habitats and this results in natural behaviour and happy, secure animals.

'When the Centre is open, regular keeper talks allow visitors to see and photograph the animals up close.

'The enthusiastic amateur photographer will find all they need to get the perfect wildlife image.'

This year professional wildlife photographer David Lloyd will be selecting the winners of each category, which include animal portrait, animals in their habitat and animals in motion.
