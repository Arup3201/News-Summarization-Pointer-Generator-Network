Devoted father Rob Chillingworth was snapped riding the tube with his daughter Ruby, who was dressed as snowman Olaf, on the way to the party.

The 16st heavy metal fan, from Waltham Abbey in Essex, had his blue sparkly dress and cape specially made to resemble the Disney princess.

The picture quickly went viral with more than 1.5 million views in just three days and many hailing him as 'father of the year'.

Mr Chillingworth told The Sun: 'The kids had to dress up. I thought I had to as well.

'Ruby said 'you be Elsa'. I had to get the dress made as I'm a big geezerand you can't get them in my size.'

On Twitter, many praised the biker with Tina, under the handle @Tinatbh, calling him the 'best dad ever' and Kelsey Dittloff writing that he deserved the 'best dad award .'

While Gillian Soden ‏wrote: 'Elsa has let herself go, but you cannot fail to be in awe of these superb parenting skill.'

Frozen is the most profitable animated Disney movie of all time and is continuing to rake in staggering amounts of money more than one year after its initial release, thanks to the sell-out success of the movie's merchandise.

In the lead-up to Christmas, shops across the country - and around the world -  sold out of all Frozen products, as parents desperately try to get hold of the latest Elsa or Anna doll for their child.

For some parents, their children's obsession with the popular animated flick, runs into thousands of pounds a year, with many spending on special themed parties, toys, costumes and other merchandise. 

As early as March last year, Disney had shifted half a million Anna and Elsa dolls. Two months later they had sold out of dolls altogether, only for desperate parents to discover them re-appearing on eBay, being auctioned for four times their retail price.  

Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, Frozen become a global phenomenon when it opened in 2013. 

In the Disney film, flawed heroine Elsa has magical powers meaning almost everything she touches turns to ice. After accidentally triggering an eternal winter, Elsa flees her mythical kingdom and her brave younger sister Anna sets out on an epic journey to bring her back.

The film, which subverts the fairy-tale premise that a princess's primary purpose should be to bag a handsome prince, picked up two Oscars for best song and best animated feature. But even more startling than its critical acclaim was its commercial success.

It raked in more than £820million in worldwide ticket sales, and became a huge money spinner – its merchandise boosted Disney profits by 35 per cent in the final quarter of last year, to £920 million and overtook Toy Story 3 to be the biggest animation ever.

And there are no signs of  Frozen fever abating any time soon with a sequel on the horizon.

Frozen Fever is a seven-minute short film which reunites the cast, characters, directors and even songwriters of the original 2013 movie, and will be screened ahead of Disney's Cinderella (that hits cinemas on March 13 in the US and April 3 in the UK).

'If history is any indicator, kids will go nuts,' Actor Josh Gad - voice of Olaf the snowman - tells USA Today, about the catchy new song.

The film will be shown in British cinemas from March 27.

Lego has teamed up with Disney to create Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle while Mattel has designed new Elsa and Anna dolls.

Gary Grant, chairman of Dream Toys, which compiles the Toy Retailers' Association list of must-have toys, said: 'The popularity of Frozen toys has not waned since Christmas and the Elsa doll remains a top seller.'
