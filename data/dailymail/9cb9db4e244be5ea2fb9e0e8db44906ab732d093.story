A baby boy who beat the odds so he could be at his parents' wedding day has lost his battle with a terminal brain illness, just one week after celebrating his first birthday.

Amy and Liam Ralph, from Couldson, Surrey, decided to quickly tie the knot in January after they were warned their son Jakub - who was aged just nine months at the time - could have just 32 hours to live.

The couple decided to exchange vows at their son's bedside at the Shooting Star Children's Hospice in Hampton, south west London, so little Jakub could share their special day.

The couple hastily organised their wedding ceremony at the Shooting Star Children's Hospice in Hampton, south west London, so their son Jakub could be at the ceremony

After the wedding, Jakub's condition improved and he survived against the odds for three months to celebrate his first birthday on April 22.

But the heartbroken couple announced this week that the youngster had lost his fight for life.

Grandmother Tracy Gowlett said last night: 'We always knew this day would come, but it’s just come a lot sooner than we would have wanted, and we’re all heartbroken.

'He had his first birthday, which was really good. He reached a lot of milestones that we thought he would not see but he actually did.'

Amy and Liam decided to get married in January in the hospice where Jakub had been treated.

Amy said: 'He went into the hospice and our palliative care nurse said it was unlikely he was going to last 32 hours.

The wedding was a first for the hospice, and despite being a joyful occasion in itself, Amy admits she couldn't be happy because of their son's serious condition

'So Liam and I decided instantly to get married. The hospice staff were fantastic and they arranged everything.'

But despite marrying the love of her life, Amy said it was difficult to feel happy.

She said: 'I know your wedding is meant to be the happiest day of your life, but I couldn't be happy.

'I put on a brave face in front of the guests, but I cried my eyes out whenever I was alone.

'We
 stayed with Jakub that night, thinking he'd never pull through. But he 
was still here the next morning, even the doctor couldn't believe it.'

Liam added: 'He was an 
amazing and completely wonderful child.'

Liam, an engineer for Virgin Media, proposed to Amy minutes after their 
only child Jakub
was born.

Sandi Hillery, head of care at Shooting Star House: 'The wedding was a first for us and it was a huge privilege to be involved.'
