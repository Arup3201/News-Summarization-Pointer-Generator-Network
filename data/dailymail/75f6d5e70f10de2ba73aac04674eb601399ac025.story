A dog has been killed in a bizarre accident during 100mph winds after a trampoline was blown into a power line, knocking it down and plunging it into a waterlogged back yard.

Rosie, a Border Collie, was in Dick Pritchard's back yard in Boderdern, near Holyhead, when she was electrocuted.

The father-of-two said that a gust lifted the trampoline from a garden two doors down and onto his neighbour's roof.

Dick Pritchard next to the trampoline that hit a cable, knocking it into his back yard and killing his dog when it stood in a puddle

The father-of-two said that a gust lifted the trampoline from a garden two doors down and onto his neighbour's roof

The trampoline became entangled in 
the power line and a man from next door climbed up to lower it from the 
cable and chimney despite Mr Pritchard's warnings that it could be live.
 Fortunately the neighbour was unharmed.

Mr Pritchard then took his sons, 
Aron, 15 and Iwan, nine, to school but when he returned he let the 
family pet out and she stood in a puddle.

'All of a sudden her back legs went,' he said. 'I tried to kick the cable away but she bit me. She was probably dying by then.

'I went into the house and told my wife "Rosie's dead". We'd had Rosie for nine years, we're very upset.'

Mr Pritchard needed four stitches in the first finger of his right hand and a tetanus jab.

A builder killed yesterday when his van was crushed by a tree has today been named as Christopher Hayes, 51, from Tonbridge, Kent.

England and Wales will be hit by 50mph winds.

Severe
 weather warnings have been issued for heavy rain for large parts of the
 the west coast stretching from South Wales, across Northern Ireland and
 North West England to the top of Scotland.

Billy Payne, from MeteoGroup, said: 'There's going to be a brief respite this morning, but winds will pick up later in the day.

'There
 will be maximum gusts of 75mph, mainly in exposed parts of western 
Scotland. But even across northern England and eastern and central parts
 of Scotland we're looking at gusts of 65mph to 75mph in exposed places.

'It's going to be windy in Wales and much of England, with many places seeing gusts of 50mph.

'The strongest winds will be overnight and into tomorrow morning before they subside in into the afternoon.'

Much of Scotland and the far North 
East of England woke up to heavy rain this morning and that weather is 
expected to travel south, spreading to Northern Ireland, Wales, North 
West England, Yorkshire and the Humber from 9am today.

The South is expected to see lighter rain by mid-afternoon before more torrential downpours fall throughout tonight.

Tomorrow will become gradually calmer throughout the morning as the day progresses, with a chance of sunshine in some parts.

In Scotland around 140,000 homes and businesses were left without power yesterday and 26,000 still did not have electricity this morning.

A spokesman for Scottish and Southern Energy said problems of accessibility mean that some homes will not have power restored until tomorrow and 700 engineers are working on repairing lines damaged by falling trees.

Most of the problems were being 
experienced in Berkshire, the company said. A spokesman said more than

working late into yesterday evening and overnight to fix the problems.

In Humberstone, Leicestershire, six houses were broken into over night as thieves took advantage the winds.

The gale-force storms provided enough noise for the raiders to cover up the noise of them ransacking the houses.

Computers, TVs, game consoles and cash were among the items that were taken from the.

Inspector Bill Knopp said: 'The person
 or persons involved were looking for easy access when it came to 
choosing houses. It cannot be coincidental that four of the six houses 
were unlocked.'

None of the victims realised what had happened until they woke to find their homes ransacked the next morning.

Resident Kuldip Singh, 59, who has 
lived on the street for 30 years, said: 'We are all very shocked and 
frightened, locking our doors early and not opening our doors to people 
we do not know. It is very unusual.'

The storm also claimed the life of a man on board a tanker 
which was hit by a huge wave in the Channel.

Trampolines were also blown from 
gardens in Gwynedd, where one landed on a car in Bala, and in Wrexham, 
where one flew into a neighbouring property.

A fourth trampoline was reported at 
Menai Bridge, but police could not confirm that incident, and there was 
disruption in Flintshire when wheelie bins were blown onto the A55.

Barely a single area was spared the onslaught roaring in from the Atlantic, which toppled lorries and brought down power lines.

At Great Dun Fell in the north 
Pennines, the wind as so strong that a waterfall appeared to defy 
gravity as it flowed upwards in 106mph winds.

Buildings were damaged, roads closed and trains, flights and ferries were cancelled.

The Met Office issued numerous severe weather warnings and emergency services urged motorists and pedestrians to stay indoors.

However, some had to be evacuated from their houses because of flooding.

Sleet
 and snow added to the problems in some parts, bringing a cold wake-up 
call to Britain in 2012 after an unusually mild festive season.

A Met Office spokesman said last night: ‘An intense Atlantic storm passed over the UK bringing some very strong winds with it.

‘We do expect stormy conditions at this time of year, but the strength of this one was unusual.’

The driver who died was a man in his 
50s whose identity has not been revealed. A 3ft-diameter tree trunk 
smashed on to his van in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.

Numerous roads near rivers and the 
coast were shut after flood alerts, with the Environment Agency issuing 
21 river alerts in the South West alone.

Waves
 hit massive heights around the coast and Portland Coastguard in Dorset,
 where 45ft breakers rolled in, warned people to keep their distance.

A spokesman said: 
‘Often people like to walk along harbour walls or go on the beach to see
 the waves, but they really do need to keep well clear – it is very 
dangerous.’
