A horrific house fire which killed three girls and their grandparents was reportedly caused by a smouldering bucket of embers left in a hallway.

Lomer Johnson, 71, and his wife Pauline, 69, perished along with their grandchildren Lily, 10, and seven-year-old twins Sarah and Grace in the 5am fire at their daughter's million-dollar home in Stamford, Connecticut on Christmas Day.

Madonna Badger, 47, a
former Calvin Klein art director, climbed onto the roof of her burning 
house and tried to smash the windows of her daughters' bedrooms in a bid
to save them from the flames ravaging her home.

Johnson worked as 'Happy Santa'

Rubble: The house has been demolished by firefighters after the fatal blaze

Mrs Badger and boyfriend Michael Borcina survived the horrific Christmas day fire at her Stamford, Connecticut home.

The couple had stayed up late wrapping gifts in front of the fireplace before loading the smouldering embers into a bucket and going to bed, emergency workers told the New York Daily News. This was thought to have been the cause of the fire.

Mrs Badger's elderly father Lomer Johnson had played Santa 
Claus right up until Christmas Eve because it was 'all he ever wanted to
be'.

The grandfather played Father Christmas at the Saks Fifth Avenue 
flagship store in Manhattan, New York. His wife Pauline 
Johnson, 69, watched on as he handed out candy canes and posed for 
pictures with delighted children.

The Johnsons were to celebrate their 49th wedding anniversary today. They moved to the New York area 
from Kentucky five years ago to be near their grandchildren, according 
to the New York Times and Mr Johnson landed his dream job.

'That’s all he ever wanted to be,' a family member told the New York Times. 'He stopped shaving the day he retired.'

A store spokeswoman added: 'Mr Johnson was Saks Fifth Avenue's beloved Santa, and we are heartbroken about this terrible tragedy.'

Prior to becoming Father Christmas, Mr Johnson had a long career as a safety chief at a liquor company in Kentucky.

Lomer Johnson was remembered fondly as a stickler for safety by a former boss at Louisville based liquor maker Brown-Forman Corporation.

'He spent his career trying to keep others safe,' retired Brown-Forman executive Robert Holmes Jr said in a telephone interview.

'And the irony is that he dies in a fire.'

During Johnson's long career with Brown-Forman, whose many brands include Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort, he was responsible for security and safety at the company's headquarters and production plants.

His responsibilities included helping plan fire drills, his colleague said.

Mr Holmes, who worked with Mr Johnson for more than a decade at Brown-Forman, remembered his co-worker as a big man with white hair and a commanding presence.

'He was a man of not a lot of words, but when Lomer spoke or gave his opinion, it was always well thought out,' Holmes said.

He said he was a bit surprised that the longtime security chief had become a department store Santa but added: 'I could see Lomer doing something like that because Lomer had a passion for people.'

Firefighters desperately tried to reach the family members who were trapped on the second floor of the $1,725,000 house by the raging flames.

Witnesses said Mrs Badger, who runs Badger and Winters 
fashion branding consulting firm and created the Mark Wahlberg underwear adverts for Calvin Klein, was dazed as rescue workers helped her.

She was heard saying: 'My whole life is in there.'

She was seen being led away from the 
flames with Mr Borcina, who was barefoot and wearing 
boxers and a t-shirt.

Mr 
Borcina is the president of New York City construction firm Tiberias 
Construction Inc., believed to be the company renovating the 
five-bedroom home. This is thought to be unrelated to the fire.

Mr Johnson was known as 'Happy Santa'
and started the festive career after his granddaughter asked him to 
pretend to be Santa Claus.

On site Gigmasters.com, the former security director writes: 'I've enjoyed it more than any job I've ever had.'

Along with his wife and grandchildren, Mr Johnson was unable to escape the flames at the Connecticut home.

What remained of the home was torn down today after it was deemed unsafe by authorities. Neighbours came to the tragic scene to leave flowers, candles and soft toys by the family's mailbox.

Witness Charles Mangano, who lives near the 
scene, said: 'My wife woke me up and said there was a huge fire that she could see out the window.

'I ran outside and heard someone 
yelling ''Help, help, help me''...I ran up the driveway and saw there 
were tons and tons of fire apparatus here.

'There was nothing I could do.'

The neighbour added that he didn't know the family who lived in the home.

'They moved in this summer, there was a whole construction job going on there... it was new people.'

Madonna Badger were reported to be a 'fair condition' at Stamford Hospital on Sunday afternoon. A supervisor at the hospital said she was treated and discharged by the evening. Her whereabouts are unknown,

Mr Borcina was also hospitalised but his condition was not released.

Police officers drove Mrs Badger's husband, Matthew Badger, from New York City to Stamford on Sunday morning.

Mrs Badger's former super, Trifu Penca, 
told the New York Post the couple had separated three years ago. She 
filed for divorce in October.

A relative told the paper that Mr Badger was 'absolutely distraught' on hearing of his daughters' deaths.

'It
is a terrible, terrible day for the city of Stamford,' Mayor Michael 
Pavia told reporters at a news briefing at the scene of the fire.

 'Her loss defies explanation.'

Governor Dannel P Malloy

'There probably has not been a worse Christmas day in the city of Stamford.'

Governor Dannel P. Malloy, a former mayor of Stamford, offered his condolences to Mrs Badger and her family in a statement and said her loss 'defies explanation'.

Acting Fire Chief Antonio Conte said 
desperate attempts by firefighters to rescue the family were thwarted by the intense flames and heat.

'We just couldn't get to them,' Conte
told reporters clearly emotional having witnesses the horrific scenes 
faced by all of the emergency crews. A total of 46 firefighters attended the scene.

The experienced fire chief broke down in
tears when asked how the crews were dealing with such a tragedy during 
the press briefing.

Aftermath: Investigators examine the roof of the house which collapsed during the deadly fire in Stamford

'It's never easy, that's for sure. I've been doing this job for 38 years. It's not easy.'

All five victims were removed from the second floor of the burnt-out building.

The house was being renovated but fire officials do not believe that was the cause of the blaze.

Neighbor, Sam Cingari Jr., said he was woken by the sound of screaming and saw that the house was entirely engulfed by flames.

'We heard this screaming at five in the morning,' he said. 'The whole house was ablaze and I mean ablaze.'

Cingari said he did not know his 
neighbours, who only bought the house last year and were renovating 
it.

Power had also gone out in the neighbourhood, he said.

Property records show Mrs Badger bought the five-bedroom, waterfront Victorian home for $1.7 million last year.

The house is situated in Shippan Point, a wealthy neighborhood that juts into Long Island Sound.

Tony Low-Beer, another neighbour, said he was awakened by a neighbor after 4am who told him about a 'raging fire' next door.

'Cinders were flying all over the place,' he told The Associated Press.

The neighbourhood in Stamford, a city of 
117,000 residents about 25 miles northeast of New York City.

Mayor 
Michael Pavia said: 'At this point we have nothing further to say except
that our hearts and prayers go out to the family and to the fire and 
emergency personnel on the scene.

'We're not going to answer any questions until we get the scene secured, bodies recovered and find out what the cause was.'

Trapped: Fire officials are trying to determine what started the deadly fire at the Stamford, Connecticut home. They do not believe the home's renovations were to blame and say it could take days to find out the cause

Emotional: Antonio Conte, Stamford Fire Chief, left, is overcome with 
emotion as he talks to press about the fatal fire with Michael Pavia, 
mayor of Stamford, on Christmas day

Fire: A neighbour was woken up in the early hours by screaming and saw the house was engulfed in flames
