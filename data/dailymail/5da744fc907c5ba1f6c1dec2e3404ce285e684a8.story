Fisher-Price is facing a backlash over its decision to sell a baby bouncy seat with an attachment where parents can insert an iPad to keep their newborns entertained.

The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a Boston-based advocacy group, wants the company to recall its Newborn-to-Toddler Apptivity Seat for iPads.

The group says it's not healthy for a baby's development and encourages parents to leave baby alone.

Outrage: Fisher Price faced a heavy backlash last December when it introduced this iPad-enabled baby bouncing seat, pictured. Experts warned it could affect development and limit parent-child interaction

Demanding a recall: Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood is calling on Fisher-Price to immediately stop selling its Newborn-to-Toddler Apptivity¿ Seat for iPad® device

The seat is angering parents and child advocates who say the introduction of screen technology so early is harmful to the health and development of babies and claim Fisher-Price’s seat hits a new low.

The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood today began a letter writing campaign against the $75 product, calling it 'oppressive and destructive to young children,' while also naming it the worst toy of the year.

Fisher-Price’s iPad seat is the 'ultimate electronic babysitter, whose very existence suggests that it’s fine to leave babies as young as newborns all alone and with an iPad inches from their face,' said Susan Linn, director of child advocacy group the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC).

'Fisher-Price should stay true to its mission to foster learning and development by creating products for infants that promote, rather than undermine, interaction with caregivers,' Ms Linn said.

How it works: The Apptivity Seat is a bouncy seat for infants with a place for an iPad directly above the baby¿s face. Critics say it blocks his or her view of the rest of the world

There is an equal amount of outrage 
aimed at a similar product aimed at potty-training toddlers
 which mounts an iPad in infront of a child who is learning to use the 
toilet.

Both efforts ask 
for the products to be recalled under the guise that they could harm 
developmental learning of body cues, and socialization.

Victor
 Strasburger, a doctor and professor of pediatrics at the University of 
New Mexico School of Medicine said attaching iPads to babies’ seats is 
'a terrible idea.'

'Does 
anyone out there think that kids need more screen time?” Strasburger 
asked. “There is no need to hurry to expose kids to new technology, 
certainly not babies — or newborns!'

A doctor who spoke to ABC is weary about how it might affect babies.

‘I think parents need to be really careful here,’ said Dr. Richard Besser.

He
 explained that toddler’s brains go through changes and a lot of 
development in early years before explaining that the real world, not 
the virtual one, is where babies belong.

Virtual babysitter: More than half of U.S. parents have admitted that they use tech gadgets to entertain their children when they are busy

Other options: The arm can be removed to 'disable' the iPad-holding feature

‘The
 best thing for a child is extensive interaction with people, hearing 
voices, seeing faces, physically touching toys,’ he said. ‘I worry that 
screens will replace these important human interactions.’

Fisher-Price describes the seat on its Web site as 'a grow-with-me seat
 for baby that’s soothing, entertaining, and has a touch of technology, 
too.'

Mattel is already 
under pressure by the CCFC and other advocacy groups that have 
complained to the Federal Trade Commission that Fisher-Price’s mobile 
Apptivity suite of apps deceives consumers with promised educational 
benefits despite little research having been done to prove that online 
sites can help babies’ brain development.

Parent company Mattel has kept quiet on the matter so far.

The
 slew of new baby-tech products has drawn criticism from parents 
blasting CTA and Fisher-Price in Amazon.com’s customer-review sections. 
Fisher-Price’s seat had more than 100 reviews, the majority negative.

One
 customer wrote: 'I am disgusted with Fisher Price and urge Amazon to 
reconsider carrying this terrible contraption!! First of all children 
need to be able to move and putting them on the floor (on rugs or mats) 
is the best way they can freely move and explore their world. Secondly, 
the American Pediatric Association recommends NO SCREEN TIME for babies 
under 2.

Babies need 
to move to understand and explore their world and they need to 
manipulate things, not passively watch them! It has NO redeeming 
features, it is actually detrimental to children 's growth and 
development!! For shame Fisher Price - you have stooped to new lows (and
 there are lots of them).'

Other
 reviewers wrote similar scathing remarks: 'This has to be one of the 
worst ideas for a baby product that I have ever seen. Babies under six 
months of age should NEVER be strapped in and forced to stare at a 
screen pulsing images in front of them.

Not only is it horrible for vision and brain development, but it 
encourages irresponsible parenting as well. The American Academy of 
Pediatrics recommends ZERO screen time for children under the age of 
two.'

Bathroom reading: There have also been complaints about this potty-training device that comes complete with room for an iPad

As companies rush to 
integrate technology into toys, baby gear and classrooms, doctors and 
child advocates say children today are immersed more than ever in a 
world of screens and thatt constant access to games, television and the 
Internet may be taking away from family time, exercise and discovery in 
the physical world, critics say.

It's not the first time Fisher Price has been in the hot seat for a high-tech baby toy.

Last year the company picked up the same worst toy award from the group for a stuffed monkey toy that mounted an iPhone in the belly area, and ran special Fisher Price apps.
