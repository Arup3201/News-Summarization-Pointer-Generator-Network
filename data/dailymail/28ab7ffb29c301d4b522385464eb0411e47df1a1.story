A soldier mom surprised her daughter by turning up at her fifth grade class yesterday - more than a year after she was posted to Afghanistan.

Veronica Velasquez decided to shock 10 year-old daughter Jamie Sanchez with her homecoming.

Velasquez coordinated the surprise, caught on film, with her sister and her boyfriend, who have helped care for Velasquez's three children in her absence, and teachers at Vaughn Elementary School, Los Angeles.

Still in uniform, Velasquez smiles as she enters Jamie's classroom and before she can say anything she is greeted by a cry of shock and a huge bear-hug from her daughter who runs to the front of the class.

A tearful Jamie told ABCNews: 'I missed everything about her - her voice, seeing her face - every day'.

Velasquez will spend the next two weeks with her family in California before being sent to a base in New York for the remaining year and a half of her military service.

'That was the first thing that came 
to my mind, was always my kids,' she told the broadcaster.

'Birthdays, 
holidays, pretty much I missed everything for a whole year. It’s time 
that I can’t really make up, but just spend more time with them.'

The school’s executive director, Anita Zepeda, told that ABC that Sanchez was 'very proud of her mother' and brought in a photo of her on Veteran's Day.

Velasquez's sister's boyfriend, Victor Sosa, said he helped plan the surprise to honor Velasquez's service.

'It’s indescribable. Being away from someone you love with all your heart. That’s why I wanted to do it so bad for, just seeing the sacrifice from her family,' the college student said.
