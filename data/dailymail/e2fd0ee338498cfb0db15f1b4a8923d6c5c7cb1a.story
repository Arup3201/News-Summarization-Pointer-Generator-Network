Ajdos Ibraev, 26, has amassed an extensive fan base after videos of him dancing while working at a factory in Kazakhstan went viral on YouTube. He hopes to be bigger than the country's fictional character, Borat

Mr Ibraev, 26, said: 'I am actually a mix of Borat and Michael Jackson. I have the rhythm in me. I just have to dance, dance, dance. I don't mind being called Borat if it means I am going to be famous'

Just like Sacha Baron Cohen's fictional character from the country which once belonged to the Soviet Union, the dancer is seeking to find fame and fortune.

‘I don't mind being called Borat if it means I am going to be famous,’ he said.

‘I am actually a mix of Borat and Michael Jackson. I have the rhythm in me. I just have to dance, dance, dance’

He began his dance routines by entertaining the workers during his lunchbreak at the factory where he works in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.

His antics went viral after a colleague filmed his moves and posted the footage online.

‘It started when I was a kid. I just couldn't resist getting up and moving to any and every piece of music I heard,’ he said.

‘You don't have to be black or Brazilian to have the rhythm in your soul - people from Kazakhstan have got it too!’

In the video, Mr Ibraev can be seen moving to the beat of 'Do it all night' by Darius and Finla, while wearing an orange high visibility jacket.

It is one of numerous routines he performs at weddings, social functions and dance groups.

He now hopes the success of his video will give him the wider audience he craves.

‘Borat pulled out of Kazakhstan in a horse-drawn Lada but I want to leave town in a Rolls-Royce,’ he joked.
