Sea levels could rise far more rapidly than expected because canyons under Greenland's ocean-feeding glaciers are deeper and longer than previously thought.

This was the warning issued by Nasa after researchers in California created the most detailed map to date of Greenland's vast canyon network hiding beneath its ice sheets.

Their map revealed new valleys that sink below sea level, which can make glaciers more susceptible to melting, according to the study.

After Antarctica, Greenland's ice cap contains the second largest mass
of frozen freshwater in the world.

The ice sheet ice sheet covers 660,000 sq miles (1,710,000 square km), or roughly 80 per cent of the surface of Greenland.

Currently, melting from Greenland accounts
 is thought to account for around 10 per cent of sea level rise.

Researchers estimate half of Greenland's outlet glaciers could undergo 
significant melting.

canyons beneath glaciers that empty into the ocean

A number of other glacial valleys found in the study are deeper and wider than those shown in earlier maps, and are located farther inland at an average distance of 41 miles (67 km).

The findings mean some of Greenland's scenarios for melting ice need to be revised, the researchers said.

The IPCC said last year that sea levels are likely to rise by between 10 and 32 inches (26 and 82 centimetres) by the late 21st century, after a rise of just seven inches (19 centimetres) since 1900

However, older ice sheet models predicted the speedup would be temporary because the glaciers would soon melt back onto higher ground and stabilise.

‘The glaciers of Greenland are likely to retreat faster and farther inland than anticipated, and for much longer, according to this very different topography we have discovered,’ said Mathieu Morlighem, a scientists at the University of California, Irvine (UCI),

UCI and Nasa’s latest study shows southern Greenland's ragged, crumbling coastline is scored by more than 100 canyons beneath glaciers that empty into the ocean.

Many canyons are well below sea level as far as 60 miles (100km) inland. Higher ground, where glaciers could stabilise, is much farther from the coastline than previously thought.

Buried under the Greenland Ice Sheet, the subcontinent's bedrock topography has been estimated using soundings from ice-penetrating radar.

However, the wet and fractured ice along the southern coastline cluttered the radar soundings so that large swaths of the bed remained invisible.

To overcome that problem, Professor Morlighem and his colleagues devised an advanced technique to create a more accurate map.

The technique makes the best use of several kinds of data: ice thickness measurements derived from airborne radar; satellite radar interferometry data on the speed and direction of ice movement: and estimates of snowfall and surface melt to the sea.

By combining the different types of data, they were able to map the bed topography along Greenland's margins with unprecedented precision and detail.

‘The ice will stay in contact with the ocean for longer than we thought’, Professor Morlighem told Live Science. ‘Greenland is more vulnerable than we thought, but we can't say by how much.’

In August, a 466 mile-long (750 km) chasm on the same scale as parts of the Grand Canyon was discovered beneath the Greenland ice sheet.

The canyon, which is as deep as 2,620ft (800m) in places, is thought to predate the ice sheet, which has itself been around for millions of years.

In another study offering another sea-level rise warning, vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries, according to scientists.

In a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to current sea levels.

A Nasa study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data of what researchers call 'the weak underbelly of West Antarctica' shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process.

The coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level, holding back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt, he said.

'It does seem to be happening quickly,' says University of Washington glaciologist Ian Joughin, lead author of a separate study into the same phenomenon.

'We really are witnessing the beginning stages.'

It has the characteristics of a meandering river channel, although it dwarfs the UK’s largest river, the Severn, which is less than half the length and far more shallow.

The canyon was found after scientists analysed radar signals collected by Nasa and researchers from the UK and Germany over several decades.

Professor Jonathan Bamber, of Bristol University’s School of Geographical Sciences, said: 'With Google Streetview available for many cities around the world and digital maps for everything from population density to happiness one might assume that the landscape of the Earth has been fully explored and mapped.

'Our research shows there’s still a lot left to discover.'

Europe:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects 'multiple stresses and systemic failures due to 
climate change' in the Mediterranean. This will increase energy costs 
and damage tourism from 2050.

North America:
Flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms 
moving north of New York. Southern areas are expected to experience a 
shortage of water.

Asia: 
The majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be 
in southern and eastern Asia. However, water  is also expected to affect
most of Asia.

Australasia: 
There remains uncertainty about impact in Australasia, but extreme 
weather is predicted. The Great Barrier Reef will continue to degrade, 
with warmer  water bleaching more coral.

Africa: 
Food security will be a major issue for Africa. Crops and livestock 
will be affected by both flooding and drought. There will also be more 
soil erosion from storms.

Central and South America: 
Scientists expect Northern Brazil may lose 22 per cent of its annual 
rainfall by 2100, while the area around Chile could get a 25 per cent 
increase.
