Family members of slain Hofstra coed gave their final goodbyes at an
emotional funeral service Wednesday, including the victim’s distraught twin
sister who is unable to eat and keeps keeps asking how she could have prevented
the tragedy.

Andrea Rebello, 21, died after a cop accidentally shot her in her home after a man broke in and took her hostage. Twin sister Jessica was at the house at the time of the shooting.

Family members and college classmates were packed into Sleepy Hollow, New York's St. Teresa of Avila Church church May 22 to bid Rebello a final farewell and try to make sense of the tragedy.

Heartbreak: Jessica Rebello, right, is asking what she could have done to prevent the killing of her twin Andrea

'During this 
tragedy a question comes to mind - why?' Reverand Osvaldo Franklin said.
 'Why Andrea, in the flower of her youth, she left us?'

As the crowd sobbed, lohud.com reports, Franklin tried to offer comfort, if not an answer.

'She has left us to join our father in heaven,' Franklin said. 'We are here to pray for the family that she left behind.'

Perhaps the most besieged among the crowd of 500 was th emotionally stricken Jessica Rebello.

The grandfather of Andrea Rebello, 
who died after Dalton Smith, 30, forced his way into the house near 
Hofstra University early on Friday morning, said her twin now sleeps 
much of the time.

'When she wakes up, she says "Oh my God, what did I do wrong?"' Henrique Santos told Newsday.

Disbelief: Mourners embrace outside the church, five days after Andrea was accidentally shot dead

He said Jessica does not blame herself but constantly asks 
how she could have prevented it.

The service was held after friends gathered at a wake for Rebello in Tarrytown, New York on 
Tuesday night.

She was killed when officer Nikolas 
Budimlic responded to the break in and entered the home, where he found 
Dalton Smith holding Andrea in a headlock.

He fired eight shots, fatally hitting Andrea in the head and killing Smith.

Torn apart: The girls lived in the house with other sorority sisters just a block from Hofstra University

The New York police union has defended Budimlic by  saying the only person responsible for the woman's death was the gunman who held her hostage.

'There
 is some second guessing by people who think we should have stayed 
outside the house, but our job is to get inside and make sure we can 
protect as many people as we can,' said James Carver.

Budimlic is on sick leave while authorities investigate.

'The
 officer sends his thoughts and prayers to the victim,' Carver said. 'He
 is a religious man and has a strong family background, and he has a lot
 of support from his family and friends.'

Nassau police sources said that the police officer had followed the rules, calling it a 'tragic accident'.

'There's
 no playbook. You arrive at a home, and the guy has a gun to the 
victim’s head - what do you do?' the source said. 'You rely on your 
training and your instincts and hope for the best outcome.'

But Andrea's grandfather questioned the protocol the officer was following.

'I think the police is not very professional,' Santos said. 'If he's professional, he should have tried negotiation.'

Response: Two police officers responded to the scene (pictured on Friday) and found Smith holding a gun to Rebello's head. One of the officers shot eight times, hitting Rebello once in the head

Others echoed this sentiment, asking whether officers should have waited for help from a hostage negotiating team.

A high school friend of Andrea Rebello said he believed her death could have been prevented.

'It's
 a tragedy,' Anthony Martinato of Tarrytown said outside Coffey Funeral 
Home. 'The only time I see her is in an open coffin.'

But Patty
 Neuwirth of Briarcliff Manor, who knows Rebello's father, said she 
sympathized with everyone involved, including the police officer.

'None of us can put ourselves in the position of any of them,' Neuwirth said.

Another family friend, Maria Sousa of Millbrook, described the family as 'beyond devastated.'

Twins: The Rebello girls came as a unit, university staff said, and Jessica (right) is now unable to eat

'I think this was unnecessary,' Sousa said, adding that the officer should have waited for backup.

A key question is whether the officers responding to the house near the Hofstra campus early Friday were aware the intruder was holding hostages.

Police officials described the initial report as simply a robbery in progress. After Smith forced his way into the home, he demanded money for the sisters and two other people in the home.

He allowed one of the students to leave to get money from an ATM but she called police.

'[The officer] went into the house, he deemed it was not appropriate to wait at that time,' Carver said. 'If he would have waited, we don't know what could have happened.'

Smith had a warrant out for his arrest for violating his parole.

Respect: Mourners arrive at Andrea Rebello's wake Tuesday ahead of her funeral on Wednesday

Memorial: Most of the crowd at the Tarrytown wake wore black to remember the Hofstra student

The state Department of Corrections and 
Community Supervision said he served nine years of a 10-year sentence 
for attempted robbery and criminal possession of a weapon and was 
released in May 2012.

He was arrested for a parole violation in July and was told he wouldn't have to go back to prison if he successfully completed a 90-day drug treatment program. He finished the program in February.

A warrant was issued in April after he didn't make contact with his parole officer and left his approved residence.
