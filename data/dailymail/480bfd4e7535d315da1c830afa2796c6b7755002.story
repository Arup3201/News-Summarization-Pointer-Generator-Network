A former high school teacher who was sentenced on Monday for having sex with students was revealed to have married one of her victims.

Tonya Flink, 40, a disgraced IT teacher at Haltom High School in Texas, was sentenced to probation following a plea agreement which saw the mother-of-three plead guilty to two counts of improper relationship involving two students.

A prosecutor told the criminal court in Fort Worth that Flink was now married to one of her victims. A source confirmed to MailOnline that Flink wed 20-year-old Richard Ortiz, a former Haltom student, this year.

Former Texas high school teacher Tonya Flink, 40, was sentenced to probation on Monday for having sex with two students as it emerged she married one, Richard Ortiz (pictured right), now 20

Assistant District Attorney Robert Foran told the Star-Telegram on Monday: 'This was unusual case in that one victim married the defendant and was not cooperative.

'The second victim is in agreement with 
the outcome. After taking into consideration all of the facts and 
circumstances of both cases, we felt this was an appropriate 
resolution.'

Flink had sex with at least four male students during the school year 2010-11, according to an affidavit, which also said she told one 'she liked young Hispanic kids'.

The 40-year-old, who now works at an AMC movie theater, had 'done everything you could imagine', one student claimed.

Flink was having liaisons with four male students but two refused to cooperate with the authorities.

According to Facebook, Mr Ortiz's wedding anniversary is January 3, 2013. The high school graduate and disgraced teacher are believed to live together in Hurst, Texas.

Flink is divorced from her first husband Joseph Flink.

Mr Ortiz is a year younger than Flink's eldest son Kelby. The former teacher also has a child in high school and one who is five years old.

As of 2pm (EST) Mr Ortiz was friends with Kelby Flink on Facebook.

Mr Ortiz has since closed his Facebook profile.

Flink taught at the high school for four years before resigning in 2011 during the investigation.

Phone
records from the time showed that Flink and one student made 850 phone 
calls to each other over a six-month period and sent hundreds of text 
messages. 

According to
testimony by one student, Flink was described as 'pushing herself on 
him' before the pair's sexual relationship snowballed into ‘everything 
you could imagine'.

It's
that same student who later told police that in addition to Flink 
buying him clothes and gifts, on several instances she showed up at his 
home knocking on his back door looking for sex.

The Tarrant County probation department will decide whether Flink should sign the sex offenders' register.
