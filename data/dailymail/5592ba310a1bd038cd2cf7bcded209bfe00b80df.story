The actor who plays Lord Grantham in TV drama Downton Abbey has hit out at those who believe the show’s Labrador Isis is being killed off because it shares its name with the Middle East jihadist group.

Hugh Bonneville, 50, said anyone who thinks the reason for the dog’s current storyline in Julian Fellowes' period drama is down to Islamists is a ‘complete berk’.

The yellow Labrador, who was named after the Egyptian goddess Isis - whose name means 'throne' -was diagnosed with cancer in the latest episode of the fifth series.

Hugh Bonneville, 50, who plays Lord Grantham in TV drama Downton Abbey said anyone who thinks the reason for Isis the dog’s current storyline in Julian Fellowes' period drama is down to Islamists is a ‘complete berk’

It prompted a wave of speculation from fans and critics who claimed the dramatic storyline was a result of grim comparisons being drawn between the dog’s name and the rise of militants branding themselves Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - also known as IS, ISIL and Islamic State.

The militant group has been responsible for brutally beheading several hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning and fellow Briton David Haines. ISIS militants are also behind the murders of U.S. journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley.

However, Mr Bonneville has denied the show’s storylines have been influenced by the terrorist group and said dogs in the show have always been named after Egyptian goddesses.

On his website, he wrote: ‘To clarify recent speculation, the Labrador that appeared in Series One (1912-14) was a dog called Pharaoh.

‘From Series Two (1916-1920) onwards, the Labrador has been a bitch named – in keeping with the Egyptian theme – Isis.

‘Anyone who genuinely believes the Series 5 storyline (1924) involving the animal was a reaction to recent world news is a complete berk.’

Isis the dog made her first appearance in the period drama in its second series in 2011, replacing the earl's previous pet Pharaoh.

Dozens of businesses and organisations around the world have been forced to change their name after being boycotted by customers who believed they were linked to the Middle East jihadist group.

From being named after the Egyptian goddess Isis, whose name means 'throne', to abbreviations, many businesses have adopted the name Isis in some form or another.

However, after the rise of the jihadist network Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - also known as IS, ISIL and Islamic State - many have been forced to re-think their brand due to grim comparisons being drawn. 

Earlier this month, a café in Manchester called Isis decided to change its name to Thairish - a combination of Thai and Irish - after parallels were drawn.

Owners of the cafe said they were visited by police  who warned them of potential trouble over the name and later chose to change it amid fears of being targeted. 

A London-based private equity firm called Isis Equity Partners has also changed its name to Softcard after stating it was 'no longer prepared to share its name with a terrorist organisation'.

ISIS Nova Scotia, a Canadian organisation which helps new immigrants settle in the country, is also currently deciding on a new name because it doesn't want to 're-traumatise' those who it helps. 

And a Belgian chocolate maker has also been forced to change its name from Isis to Libeert after comparisons were drawn to the terrorist group. 

Another business, a ladies' clothes shop in Malvern, Worcestershire, has also been forced to issue a statement saying it has no connection to the extremist group due to its name being IsisBoutique.

Jill Campbell, who has run the the boutique for seven years, became a victim of a hate campaign after people mistakenly linked it to the jihadist network terrorising the Middle East. 

Tesco has recently put a range of flat-screen TVs branded ISIS (pictured) on sale at heavily-reduced prices

The 54-year-old issued a statement earlier this year in which she denied any affiliation with the group and suggested she may consider a name change. 

It also emerged this week that Tesco has put a range of flat-screen TVs branded ISIS on sale at heavily-reduced prices, sparking suggestions it is down to them sharing the name with the islamists. 

The ISIS 28 and 22 inch LED TVs, which normally retail at £179 and £129, have been reduced to £89 and £64, respectively.

Shoppers have suggested the sudden sale of the electronics product is down to people drawing comparisons, but Tesco has denied there is any link and said the promotion 'has nothing to do with the terrorist group'.

ITV has previously insisted the whole name issue is ‘an unfortunate coincidence’, adding that most of the current series was filmed before fans began pointing out the similarity in names.

A spokesman said: 'Isis has been the Crawley's family pet since Series 2 (2011) and was named after the Egyptian Goddess.

'At the time the dog was named and up to and including the majority of filming of Series 5, no one was using that acronym to describe a terror group.

‘It is an unfortunate coincidence.’ 

The ITV show's dog is not the only one to be hit by comparisons between its name and the jihadist group.

Dozens of businesses have been forced to change their name after being boycotted by customers who believed they were linked to the militants.

A café in Manchester called Isis decided to change its name to Thairish - a combination of Thai and Irish - after parallels were drawn, and a London-based private equity firm called Isis Equity Partners changed its name to Softcard after stating it was 'no longer prepared to share its name with a terrorist organisation'.

ITV has previously said the name issue of the popular show's dog is just an 'unfortunate coincidence'

The goddess Isis was first worshipped in Ancient Egypt as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic.

She is often depicted as the mother of Horus, the falcon-headed god featured throughout Egyptian theology.

Her image as a model of womanhood made her popular both with the slaves, who saw her as a mother-figure, and the wealthy, who saw her as a example to wives.

It was believed that the annual flooding of the River Nile came from the tears of Isis as she wept over the death of her brother Osiris. 

The figure of Isis passed into Roman and Greek mythology and she is still worshipped by some pagans today. 

Some scholars have suggested images of Isis holding her son influenced images of Mary and Jesus in Christian religion.

She was also incorporated into the symbolism of Freemasonry and is referred to in Mozart's opera, the Magic Flute.

The goddess also gives her name to the section of the River Thames from its source until it reaches Dorchester-on-Thames.
