Those planning a marriage proposal should look away now, as a YouTube video reveals the elaborate lengths one man went to get his girlfriend to say 'yes'.

Bradley Jansen, 24, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, recruited around 90 members of family and friends to perform a lip dub to One Direction's One Thing, as he asked his college sweetheart, Emily Kaplan, to marry him.

The romantic captured the stunt on camera, and his self edited film, titled Brad and Emily Get Engaged, has become an internet hit with more than 150,000 views worldwide.

Will you marry me? Bradley Jansen recruited around 90 members of family and friends to perform a lip dub, as he proposed to his college sweetheart Emily Kaplan

Talking about the event, which took place over Memorial Day weekend last month, Miss Kaplan told MLive.com: 'I had no idea at all. My whole family was involved, and I had no clue.'

The week before he popped the question Bradley, who runs a production company called Bradley Productions, went to Tunnel Park to see if the location would work.

He also approached friends and family and asked if they would be able to start practicing the choreographed routine. And his organisation paid off, as everything worked without a hitch.

At the start of Brad and Emily Get Engaged the duo are shown driving along, when all of a sudden One Direction’s One Thing starts playing on a handheld boom box.

Grand surprise: Emil, who works as a teacher, said 'My whole family was involved, and I had no clue'

Bradley then turns to Emily and starts lip synching, before pulling the car over as they arrive at the park in Lake Michigan.

The
camera pulls back to reveal friends and family performing a routine and lip dubbing, as Bradley takes Emily by the 
hand and leads her through a wooded area to the shoreline.

She squeals with excitement as her parents appear dancing and singing and friends jump out to surprise her.

Bradley tells viewers of the film that: 'After the lip dub there were notes along the beach for Emily to read. Each note had a favourite memory and led her to the spot where I would propose.'

Touching: Emily watches video messages from her and Bradley's family and friends

Meticulously planned: The week before he proposed Bradley visited the location to make sure it was right

Once she is at the beach Emily, who 
works as teacher, is left alone to watch a number of video messages from
those special to her.

Bradley had interviewed their parents and other friends, before editing the clips into a collage.

One friend says: 'I honestly do see and feel that Emily is the most of who she is with Brad, and it makes me very happy to see.'

And another describes how besotted 
Bradley is, adding: 'With all the girls he’s liked so far there was 
something that pulled his back always.

'But with you Emily he said that there was nothing, nothing, there was no doubt in his mind. I thought that said a lot. Love is the main component in marriage and I think y'all got that.'

After the clips stop playing, Bradley appears and pops the question. And to his relief Emily says yes.

She added: 'He is wonderful. Anyone who knows him knows he is super creative,'

The newly engaged couple, who are Calvin College graduates, say they haven't set a date for the wedding yet, but they plan to get married sometime in the summer of 2013.

After posting the video on Facebook one of Miss Kaplan's friends commented: 'Emily! I loved the video... your husband-to-be is awesome just for pulling that whole thing off! Seriously it was great!'
