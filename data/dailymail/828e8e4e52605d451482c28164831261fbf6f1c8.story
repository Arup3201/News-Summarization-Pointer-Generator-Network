Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto who was allegedly filmed smoking crack, 'beat' wrestling legend Hulk Hogan in an arm wrestling match Friday.

The fight happened at 10am as part of Hogan's visit to the city for Fan Expo, Canada's version of Comic Con.

Mayor Ford has been the subject of a recent scandal involving a video that depicted him smoking crack.

Winner? Toronto mayor and rumored crack user Rob Ford, left, took on Hulk Hogan in an arm wrestling competition Friday and won

Crack scandal: A still from the video that was shopped around to news outlets in May, depicting the mayor smoking crack. The video has since disappeared

His supposed dealers tried shopping the tape to news outlets  including Gawker and the Toronto Star, but neither could come up with the $200,000 requested.

Eventually Gawker lost contact with the person selling the video and when they resurfaced the source said it was 'gone'.

So the match-up with Hogan may have been an attempt on Ford's part to draw attention away from the video, and his even more recent scandal of being seen wandering around drunk at a food festival last weekend.

Before the PR stint, Mayor Ford talked about not being quite ready to face to wrestler arm to arm.

'I don't know if I'm going to win the arm wrestle, but we'll see. I haven't lifted too many weights lately. We'll see what happens,' he told the Toronto Star.

And Ford did seem to struggle at first, going bright red in the face and having to readjust his seat.

Giving it his all: The competition got off to the bad start for Ford who looked like he was trying much harder than Hogan

Mayor Hogan: During the battle, Hogan threatened to both rip off Ford's arm and take his job

Comeback kid: Despite Hogan's smack talk, Ford still won

Celebration: Ford is certainly not a humble winner. He leaps to his feet while Hogan recovers from the loss

Champion: Hogan points to the unlikely champion as 'Eye of the Tiger' plays in the background

Hogan, in true WWF form, antagonized the mayor with some smack talk.

'Not only am I going to trip this arm off, I'm going to take your job,' he said.

But Ford made a comeback and pushed Hogan's arm down and jumped up victoriously while 'Eye of the Tiger' started to play.
