It was a close call for a New Zealand camerman when he luckily avoided being sprayed by lava while filming an active volcano in Vanuatu.

Bradley Ambrose was at the Marum lava lake on Ambrym Island - known for having one of the world's most active volcanoes.

Footage shows Mr Ambrose filming on the edge of the volcano as the boiling lava bursts out and over the camerman.

Mr Ambrose uploaded his footage on YouTube on Sunday, saying he was 'extremely lucky to not have had a large one hit'. 

'That was probably my closest call ever to being completely covered in lava bombs,' he said in the video.

'I was filming on the edge when an extremely large pulse of gas just came out and caused a huge lava splatter that basically covered this entire area.

'I was in the middle of it. I just ran.

'There's not one shot that's worth that so I'm going to back off and get some more protective gear on.'

The footage further shows the splatter of lava and lapilli landing around Mr Ambrose.

He says he previously measured the temperature of the lava ejections to be between 600 to 800 degrees Celsius.
