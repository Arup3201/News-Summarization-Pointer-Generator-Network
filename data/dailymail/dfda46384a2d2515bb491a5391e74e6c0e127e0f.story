Scotland's Dan Wallace won Commonwealth Games gold in the men's 400m individual medley - two months after facing the axe for urinating on a police car and being arrested in the US.

Wallace was almost ruled out of Glasgow 2014, but celebrated becoming Scotland's third swimmer to win gold by screaming: 'For Freedom!'

Wallace's battle cry - a la Braveheart - only added to the atmosphere inside the Tollcross Swimming Centre after the 21-year-old saw off rival Thomas Fraser-Holmes in the last 50m of the race.

'For freedom!': Wallace made the battle cry after winning gold for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games

'I just yelled at the top of my lungs for freedom because being here, the home crowd has really brought out the Braveheart and Scot inside of me and I just soaked up the moment,' said Wallace.

'I watched Braveheart just last week to get ready for this. It is such a Scottish thing and it warms my heart.'

The anthropology student was never thrown off Team Scotland but came agonisingly close to a personal disaster after his parents, Derek and Tanya, sold their family home to pay his university fees.

'I was very close to not making the 
team,' added Wallace. 'I got to the point in my life where I had re-evaluate 
which path I wanted to take and I chose the right one and it ended with a
 gold medal for me and the whole of Scotland, so I am very happy.

'(Being arrested) was a wake up call. I was living the life of a rock star but still trying to perform in the pool.

Passionate: Wallace said 'the home crowd has really brought out the Braveheart and Scot inside of me'

'You
 can't do both. It is all about moderation and I have learned from my 
experiences and it has paid off now. I was a student, I was away from my
 parents, I had a lot of freedom but I have learned to deal with that 
and channel it the right way.

'Hopefully this is what I will be remembered by.'

Wallace's
 performance - timed at 4.11:20 - demonstrated patience, as the 
youngster waited to pounce on tiring opponents. As a result, Australia's
 Fraser-Holmes finished second, while South Africa's Sebastien Rousseau 
got third.

Afterwards, Wallace told the BBC: 'I knew where I needed to be at each point.

'It was a dogfight to the finish but I'm really happy. It's not every day you get to race and win in front of your home crowd.'

Wallace said: ‘On the early morning of May 4, I made a poor 
decision in judgment. I understand that my accomplishments in swimming 
have the potential to be overshadowed by my behaviour outside of the 
pool.

'My actions have embarrassed my family, school, team, coaches, 
team-mates and myself. I am truly sorry to everyone affected by my 
mistake. I will use this negative experience to help me grow as a person
 and as a swimmer.’
