The estranged wife of alleged internet pirate Kim Dotcom has filed a $20 million legal claim for cash and assets including luxury cars seized in an armed raid on the New Zealand mansion they once shared.

Mona Dotcom's suit reveals details of the father of her four children's extravagant spending, such as buying eight luxury vehicles in three months, including two Mercedes in one day.

Mrs Dotcom's claim is for half of everything seized in a $40 million raid on the couple's home near Auckland in January 2012. Mr Dotcom is wanted in the United States for alleged copyright theft worth half a billion dollars over his defunct file hosting and sharing service Megaupload.

Among the seized items were 18 luxury cars worth more than $3.4 million - including one Rolls Royce and 12 Mercedes Benz - four jetskis, artworks and two Sharp 274cm televisions worth $165,000 each, the New Zealand Herald reports.

Mrs Dotcom's claim, filed in the United States, reveals her estranged husband spent more than $2 million on eight luxury vehicles during a three-month holiday to New Zealand in March 2010. Among those vehicles were two Mercedes Benz that Mr Dotcom bought in one day.

Much of the assets seized in the FBI-initiated raid were in bank accounts, including more than $19 million with Citibank, as well as almost $9 million in New Zealand government bonds.

Mr Dotcom, who was born Kim Schmitz in West Germany and changed his name in 2005, is the founder of Megaupload, which allowed users to download pirated films, music, e-books and TV shows. He is sometimes referred to as 'Dr Evil'.

US authorities allege Mr Dotcom and his Megaupload cohorts were responsible for stripping more than $500 million from copyright holders.The 40-year-old denies any wrongdoing in relation to Megaupload and is fighting extradition to the US. 

Mrs Dotcom's claim follows US authorities filing papers in the District Court of Eastern Virginia to seize $78 million of her estranged husband's assets held in New Zealand and Hong Kong. 

'I make the... property claims based on the legal advice of my marital property counsel in New Zealand and my understanding of the applicable property laws,' Mrs Dotcom said in her court filing.

'We were living in this completely happy bubble in our happy world and we didn't have any issues.' Kim Dotcom says the FBI destroyed his family

Police raided the sprawling muli-million dollar Dotcom mansion at Coatesville, outside Auckland, on January 20, 2012. They arrived armed, by helicopter, and had to cut their way into the property. 

At the time, police said Mr Dotcom retreated from officers to a fortified safe room. Two shortened shotguns were seized during the raid. Among the seized cars were a Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe worth $478,000 and a 1959 pink Cadillac convertible worth $111,000.

The seized cars sported number plates such as 'STONED', 'HACKER', 'GUILTY' and 'GOD'. 

Mr Dotcom, who has convictions for fraud and data espionage, was granted New Zealand residency in November 2010. He has Finnish and German citizenship.

The 2m tall internet entrepreneur told New Yorker in an online interview he blamed the FBI for the breakup of his five-year marriage, the New Zealand Herald reports.

'My wife and I, we were happy before the case,' he said. 'We were living in this completely happy bubble in our happy world and we didn't have any issues.

'For me, that is the single biggest negative outcome of all with a broken family and I will not be with my wife who I loved, and that's very sad.'
