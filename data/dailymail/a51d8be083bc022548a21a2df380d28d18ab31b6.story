Criticism: Viewers have complained to Ofcom about the British Comedy Awards, hosted by Jonathan Ross, with some calling for it to be scrapped because of bad language

Viewers could have been excused for expecting an evening of jollity from the country’s sharpest wits.

But instead, Channel 4’s British Comedy Awards descended into  alcohol-fuelled profanity from the likes of Jonathan Ross.

The two-hour broadcast was described as a ‘car crash’ after a series of comics slurred their way through rambling, expletive-laden speeches.

The programme, which also suffered from technical problems, prompted a stream of invective from the audience online, and more than 50 official complaints to the broadcaster and its watchdog, Ofcom.

Many took particular offence at Ross’s performance as host, with some branding it embarrassing. Others noted that stars including Alan Carr and Johnny Vegas appeared to be drunk.

Guests at the event in north London were plied with free wine, cider and beer for an hour before the broadcast began at 9pm.

Gavin and Stacey actor Mathew Horne could be seen crawling on the floor and giggling while the show took place.

Inevitably, many of the lowlights involved 53-year-old Ross, who first presented the annual ceremony in 1991.

In one tasteless sketch, he and Lee Mack, who was named best male TV comic, joked about the infamous Sachsgate affair that led to Ross’s suspension from the BBC.

With a mask strapped to his face, the presenter pretended to be a ventriloquist’s dummy while Mack made him issue a mock apology for the incident in 2008, when he and Russell Brand left foul-mouthed messages on Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sach’s answerphone. When Mack, as Ross, began the skit with ‘hello Andrew Sachs’, Ross responded: ‘Oh f*** off’.

Bad joke: Jonathan Ross and Lee Mack in a sketch where the host was forced to apologise to Andrew Sachs using a series of expletives

Message: The host took to Twitter to show his disdain for Channel 4 after they cut the awards to show a repeat

Mack continued: ‘I’m so sorry for 
being a ****. I’ve never had the confidence to say but I’ll say it now, 
what I did was bang out of order.’

Mack
 then made Ross offer his resignation to ITV, where he now hosts a chat 
show following his departure from the BBC, before adding: ‘Once again, 
Andrew Sachs, I’m sorry.’

In
 another shocking segment, gay comedian Alan Carr told X Factor judge 
Nicole Scherzinger that he wanted to ‘do a reverse Tom Daley’ and ‘f*** 
your brains out’, referring to the Olympic diver’s recent admission that
 he is dating a man.

Vivienne
 Pattison, the director of campaign group Mediawatch-UK, branded the 
night’s swearing ‘pointless and unfunny’ and criticised Channel 4 for 
allowing it to appear uncensored.

Passionate: The thrilled comedian also kissed the host on the lips and admitted he'd 'had a drink'

Slight: Johnny Vegas took a swipe at Ricky Gervais in his speech and said his comedy was based on poking fun at 'victims'

Response: Ricky Gervais, who was not at the ceremony last night, responded to Johnny Vegas' comments online today

She said: ‘It’s a bit sad that a 
ceremony that is meant to be rewarding the wittiest comedy should resort
 to the lowest common denominator by replacing jokes with swear-words.

‘It
 wasn’t clever and it wasn’t witty. You can’t get away with using that 
kind of language in your workplace, in a shop, or at school. So why 
should people think it’s acceptable on TV?’

One upset viewer wrote online: ‘Why all the unnecessary swearing? Didn’t make them funny, just desperate.’

Another added: ‘Jonathan Ross is excruciatingly unfunny. You can tell everyone in the room is embarrassed for him.’

The
 programme overran after a bizarre rant from Johnny Vegas, who 
complained that ‘there are people in the room we don’t think should have
 won’, adding: ‘I won an award about nine years ago and haven’t won 
f****** anything since.’

As a
 result, the final speech of the night from Steve Coogan, accepting an

outstanding achievement award, was cut short to broadcast a repeat of 
the reality show Gogglebox.

This appeared to be Ross’s biggest regret of
 the night, for he later posted on Twitter: ‘Hope you enjoyed the Comedy
 Awards. Channel 4 are f****** idiots for cutting Steve Coogan’s speech 
off for a REPEAT.’

Mistake: Steve Coogan collects his award at the end of the show but his speech was cut short, which led to Jonathan Ross calling them 'f****** idiots'

Football fan: Paul Whitehouse yelled 'Yid army', a reference to his beloved Spurs, which has been banned amid concerns it incites racial hatred

Crocodile tears: At one point, Ron Burgundy had an faux emotional moment as he accepted his International Achievement award

Some 40 
viewers complained to Channel 4 about the programme while another ten 
have contacted Ofcom, which must now decide whether to investigate 
further.

A Channel 4 
spokesman said: ‘The British Comedy Awards is an established live event 
and is well-known for its raucous nature and edgy humour.

The programme 
was preceded with a warning that the humour was of an adult nature and 
contained very strong language.’

They added: ‘Unfortunately, due to a transmission error the end of Steve Coogan’s speech was unintentionally cut off.’
