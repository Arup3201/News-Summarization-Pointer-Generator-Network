Arsenal fan Chris Webber has celebrated shedding a massive 25 stone in a year by buying his first ever team shirt.

Mr Webber, 54, from Clacton, Essex, said it was 'a dream come true' to fit into the Arsenal kit.

It came after he had a gastric bypass operation last April on the NHS and slimmed down from 37 stone to 12.

He said: 'Arsenal is the love of my life so finally being able to wear the strip is a dream come true.'

'Up until last month it was impossible to find a shirt that fit me. I’ve never even been to the Emirates because the seats are too small.'

'The last game I went to was in a friendly against Celtic in 1978 - when you could stand up on the terraces.'

'My parents wouldn’t let me have an Arsenal shirt when I was at school because we lived in a mainly Spurs area and they thought it might invite trouble.'

'In my youth I was fit and had football trials at Southend United - so no one was more surprised than me at how big I became.'

The father-of-four's incredible weight loss came after he had a gastric bypass operation last April

The father-of-four said his world fell apart after he and his ex-wife Angie, 50, lost their daughter Shannon, when she was born with the umbilical chord wrapped around her neck 16 years ago.

Mr Webber turned to food for comfort and his weight ballooned to almost 40 stone.

'In the space of ten years I lost my job, my marriage fell apart and I went from weighing 19 stone to almost 40.'

'I used to visit my friends cafe every day, eat a massive cooked breakfast washed down with cups of sweet tea. After a big roast lunch I would go home and have dinner followed by a takeaway.'

'I couldn’t walk more than a few yards without getting out of breath. I got stuck in the bath twice and my wife eventually fell out of love with me.'

'I was in constant pain and at my lowest point I drove up to Beachy Head and considered ending my life. But the thought of my kids pulled me through.'

Mr Webber, father to Lee, 26, Kylie, 24, Jez, 19 and Abbie, 14, now works as a singer and is planning to record an album.

He said: 'Now I am a completely different person.'

'When I went to visit Abbie in Australia she walked right past me at the airport because she hadn’t seen me for more than a year and didn’t recognise me.'

'I was terrified that other day when I found a lump in my chest, but my daughter Kylie told me it was just my breast bone - I’d never felt it before.'

'I’m very excited about this season - I’ve got a good feeling about it. Of course I’m disappointed that Van Persie has gone, though.'

'But watching Arsenal and wearing my team’s badge - I couldn’t be happier.'
