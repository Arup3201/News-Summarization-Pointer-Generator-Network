A seven-year-old girl has struck up an unlikely friendship with an abandoned fox cub - after it fell in love with her singing.

Lydia Dimmock first spotted the animal after it set up home in her play den at the bottom of the garden.

The male cub was abandoned shortly after it was born in May so Lydia started leaving bread and milk out for it to eat at night.

Zillah, and her husband Andrew, 48, a window cleaner, contacted the Fox Project animal charity, after the animal set up home at their detached house in Tolladine, Worcester.

Zillah, a legal administrator, added: 'It was a real treat to have a wild fox living in our garden but we didn't want to do anything which could damage it's wellbeing.

'The animal charity told us not to touch the fox and not approach it.

'When either myself or my husband go into the garden Foxy always hides but it always comes out when Lydia comes out to play.'

Trevor Williams, director of The Fox Project, said: 'Fox cubs are naturally curious and clearly this one find's Lydia's singing entertaining and enjoyable.

'The animal obviously does not see Lydia as a threat but a friend and not something to run away from.'
