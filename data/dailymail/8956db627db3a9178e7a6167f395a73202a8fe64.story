Wigan have been down the bottom of the Championship all season but after a first win in 10 league games against Derby they'll be hoping that is the catalyst to kickstart their season.

James McClean scored twice as the visitors ended the Ram's 12-match unbeaten run at the iPro stadium on Saturday.

Understandably, Latics boss Uwe Rosler was delighted and not even the hardest of falls would dampen his day.

The Wigan boss was standing on the touchline issuing instructions to his side when Derby forward Johnny Russell clattered in to him with the 45-year-old landing flat on his back after the fall.

Rosler saw the funny side of it though as Russell helped him up, showing there was no hard feelings between the pair.

Rosler has been under pressure at the DW Stadium after a frustrating start to the season, but he'll be hoping this latest win will ignite his side into life as they look to go on a run to push up the table.
