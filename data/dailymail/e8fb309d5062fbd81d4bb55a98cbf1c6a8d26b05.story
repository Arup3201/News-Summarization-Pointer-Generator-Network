Lauren Astley didn't tell any of her friends she was going to see her ex-boyfriend on the night he brutally murdered her.

The 18-year-old went to Nathanial Fujita's home at the request of his mother, her friends believe, because she was worried about her son's behavior since the breakup and had not been able to get through to him.

'Well, he had gone from a kid who 
was always on the move, always working out ... to a kid who was 
basically at home, lying on the couch, looking miserable,' said 
Nathaniel's uncle, George Mattingly.

Nathaniel had stopped hanging out with friends. He was drinking a lot and smoking pot daily.

After taking him to see a 
psychiatrist, his mom thought maybe Lauren could talk some sense into 
him. And the teen obliged because she, too, had been worried about him.

Mary Dunne wants her daughter's story to serve as a wakeup call to other teens in violent relationships: 'She walked right in to this. After you have broken up with somebody, you don't go and see that person alone ever!'

Shock: Friends of Lauren and Nathanial spoke to 48 Hours about their volatile relationship but how they never thought Fujita would be capable of murder

Her friend Genevieve told CBS 48 Hours: 'She would say like, "Do you think I should do something? Do you think I should talk to him? Maybe I should try and help him?"'

Another friend added: 'Nate's mom came and visited Lauren at 
work ... and asked if it would be a good idea if she reached out to him 
and talked to him and kind of saw what was going on.'

On
 July 3, 2011, Lauren did just that and was seen leaving her job at the 
mall at 6.45pm while she was on the phone to Fujita. She was never seen 
again.

Genevieve said: 'We had had plans to hang out all the big group of us that night. No one knew that she was going [to see him].'

The 18-year-old's body was found the next day. She had been strangled with a bungee chord and her throat had been slashed.

'She went over to see that he was doing OK. And he killed her. For going over to see if he was OK,' Genevieve said.

When
 police searched Fujita's home they found bloody clothing, bungee chords
 with blood on them and a blood stain that matched Lauren's on the 
garage floor.

The 
then-19-year-old was arrested and charged with murder and, after a 
three-week trial earlier this year, he was found guilty and sentenced to
 life in prison without parole - something his uncle believes was too 
harsh.

'Nathaniel does not deserve to be thrown away. Before his depression he was a young man
 with limitless possibilities ... now he is a warehoused person with
 a number,' Mattingly said. 'Mental illness is real and nobody asks for 
it.'

Murder trial: Nathanial Fujita and his ex girlfriend Lauren Astley both went to the same high school

Loved to death: CBS' 48 Hours aired a special on Friday centering around Lauren Astley's murder at the hands of her ex boyfriend Nathanial who could not handle their breakup

Evidence: A pair of bloody sneakers were found in Nathanial Fujita's attic space the day after Lauren's body was found

But Lauren's mother Mary Dunne said: 'Lauren does not have the privilege of re-entering the world, it seems fair that Nathanial should not either.'

Speaking to 48 Hours, she said that looking back, there were signs.

'The signs, although I think they were there, were very, very soft. And I construed them as teenage, you know, behavior,' she said.

'But there was more to it than that ... and certainly there are things in retrospect that I would pay attention to, like the amount of time not at my house.

'The amount of time he had her at his house. The fact that Lauren's friends didn't like him at all and the numbers of times she tried to break up with him, that he wouldn't allow it, I think is another red flag.'

She wants her daughter's story to serve as a wakeup call to other teens in violent relationships.

'She walked right in to this,' Mary Dunne said. 'After you have broken up with somebody, you don't go and see that person alone ever!'

'Nathanial was calculated and planful and organized and purposeful - 
that's what the evidence told me. And I thought, if you are that, then you 
must pay. If she doesn't get out, you don't get out.'

Victim: Lauren Astley, pictured, was strangled to death and then had her throat slit by her exboyfriend

Shackled: Nathanial Fujita was sentenced to life without parole in a maximum security prison

Though Lauren's father hugged Fujita's parents right after the verdict telling them, 'sorry, sorry, sorry', he lamented after the trial that the boy had still not apologized to them for taking their beautiful and only daughter from them.

'I know Nate is probably numb now regarding the bleakness of his future and what he has lost. I hope he will work to keep in mind what each of us has lost, ' Malcolm Astley told the Boston Herald.

He has still not apologized for Lauren's murder.

The Lauren Dunne Astley Memorial Fund promotes healthy teen 
relationships and raises awareness of the violence towards women at the 
hands of their husbands or boyfriends.
