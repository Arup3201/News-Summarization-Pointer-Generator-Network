A Mafia fugitive who was arrested in London after evading Italian authorities for 20 years faces another wait before he knows if he will be extradited.

Domenico Rancadore - known as The Professor - will have to wait until at least March 17 after his lawyers accused international authorities of an abuse of process.

The 64-year-old, who is wanted to serve a seven-year jail term after he was convicted in 1999 of Mafia association and extortion in Trabia, near Palermo, was arrested on two European arrest warrants last August.

Prosecutors accuse him of fleeing Italy as he faced trial over his alleged Cosa Nostra 'man of honour' connections.

But his counsel Alun Jones QC - one of Britain's top barristers -Â  told Westminster Magistrates' Court today that 'misrepresentation goes to the heart of this extradition case'.

Mr Jones told the court the difference between the two arrest warrants amounted to a 'deliberate decision taken to prejudice this man's rights', because the level of crime had been elevated in the second warrant.

Today Mr Jones said: 'If you can't trust a warrant then the integrity of the scheme is undermined.'

He added the language in the current European arrest warrant is 'flowery'.

Addressing senior district judge Howard Riddle, prosecutor Hannah Hinton said: 'I say that the evidence you've heard is inconsistent.'

She said Rancadore had given 'conflicting accounts' in his evidence.

Mr Jones said the Italian authorities 'refused to say' what prison Rancadore would be detained in, but Ms Hinton said that information is 'rarely given' anyway.

Rancadore is in custody after the High Court overturned a magistrate's decision to grant bail in November.

He suffers from angina and has had a stent fitted. Mr Riddle said: 'Mr Rancadore is not in good health.'

He and his wife, Anne, moved to Britain with their two children in 1994 and lived under the name of Skinner, the maiden name of Mrs Skinner's British mother.

Police arrested 'Marc Skinner' under a European arrest warrant on August 7 at his upmarket semi-detached home in Uxbridge, west London.

Mr Riddle adjourned the extradition hearing until 10am on March 17 at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
