One of the first things I noticed when I moved to Manhattan was how many people walked around town in their gym kit at any given time of day.

Before I arrived in New York, I had assumed that the city’s numerous bars, restaurants and art galleries would be populated entirely by couture-wearing Glamazons.

How wrong I was.

Yes, New York women are arguably the most groomed in the world when they need to be.

But none seems to be deterred from turning up for casual post-work coffees in sportswear if they are heading to an exercise class afterwards.

Many British women still suffer flashbacks to our school days when we had to suffer PE lessons in navy blue nylon knickers, and thus spent our adult lives working out in old kit until it disintegrates.

In contrast, Americans are prepared to invest a lot more in their gear. Cult yoga label Lululemon is up there with Louis Vuitton on most women’s fashion wish-lists.

And just the other day, I read on Twitter that Vera Wang, who is probably best known for show-stopping Oscar frocks and high-society wedding gowns, is getting in on the act with a fitnesswear line.

Realising my ageing grey tracksuit bottoms would no longer pass muster, I decided to invest in some new fitness togs.

And I discovered there is even an item of clothing here called the ‘To-and-From’ – as in you wear it to and from your workout session. It is a lightweight, zip-up jacket designed to be worn over your workout clothes, and it doubles up as a cosy running top for when temperatures plummet.

I bought a black quilted, hooded version – and have been wearing it non-stop ever since.

At a recent breakfast meeting with 
some of the Lululemon staff, they were all dressed head-to-toe in the 
brand’s comfortable and colourful creations – just for the office.

But
 the truth is these clothes are smart enough to wear wherever and 
whenever you want. The same goes for lots of New Yorkers’ other 
favourite fitness kit.

When I wore my fluorescent orange Nike Free Runs to a show during New York Fashion Week last month, I could hardly keep count of the compliments I received.

Perhaps that’s not altogether surprising really, when sporty looks have been all over the catwalks this year, from Isabel Marant’s hip wedge trainers to Alexander Wang’s famous sweater dresses.

And then there are the designers collaborating with various sports brands, from Stella McCartney at Adidas to Alexander McQueen and Hussein Chalayan at Puma, to create some of the coolest pieces around.

So now when I look around, I’m wondering if I got it all wrong. New Yorkers might all dress as if they’re en route to a sweaty session in the gym, but the chances are they’re making a fashion statement with their fitness outfits too.
