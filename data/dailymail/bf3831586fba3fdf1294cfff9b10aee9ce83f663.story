An incredibly offensive selection of costumes offers men the chance to dress up as 'fat women' this Halloween.

The costume collections, which are available through a variety of online retailers, including Amazon.com, feature designs such as 'Tinker Belly', 'sexy fat cheerleader' and 'fat fairy' - there's even a 'fat lap dancer'.

Many of the outfits are designed and sold by online costume retailer Fun World, who proudly feature the costumes in the 'humorous' category of their website.

Other brands such as Smiffy's, Rubie's Costume Company and Forum Novelties, all offer their own takes on the offensive costume trend.

Lisa Wade, professor of sociology at Occidental College, expressed her outrage at the outfits in a piece on The Huffington Post.

'An excellent piece of evidence that femininity is hilarious or ridiculous in U.S. culture, or even frightening or disgusting, is the fact that men use the category "woman" as a Halloween costume,' she wrote.

'Many costume manufacturers (or homemade costume makers, for that matter) add fat hatred to the mix. Because there is nothing more disgusting and hilarious, we are told, than a fat woman. 

'Except, perhaps, a fat woman who fails to be properly humiliated.'

Earlier this week, Walmart came under fire after describing its plus size women's Halloween range as 'Fat Girl Costumes'. It is believed that an employee working for the store, which later apologized for the incident, posted the offensive description on its website in error.

'This never should have been on our site,' a spokesperson for Walmart told MailOnline. 'It is unacceptable, and we apologize. 

'We worked to remove it as soon as possible and we will ensure this never happens again.' 

Wonder Woman, The Queen of Hearts, a witch and a female vampire were among the costumes in the section.

The retailer removed the rude category after it sparked an outcry on social media. 

'Stay classy Walmart,' wrote Autumn Mochi, while Dave Jones commented: '... and that's how you get fired as a Walmart web developer.'
