Meanwhile, Barcelona have dismissed Liverpool's claims that they paid £75m for Luis Suarez, insisting they only shelled out £65m for the striker.

Suarez, who is unavailable to play until late October due to a FIFA ban, was finally unveiled at the Nou Camp on Tuesday.

But while the Premier League side have insisted to Sportsmail that they received the full release clause for the Uruguayan, Barca have been boasting about their bargaining skills.
