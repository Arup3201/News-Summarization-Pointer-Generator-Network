A Bangkok Airways flight out of Chiang Mai Airport to Thailand's capital city was cancelled after a fire lantern was sucked into the plane's engine.

A number of lanterns were spotted in and around the airport as the Airbus A320 taxied to its stand, with one coming to close for comfort and getting stuck to the turbine fan.

The plane was scheduled to return to Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport after landing in Chiang Mai on New Year's Day.

The flight was cancelled and the plane was later flown back to Bangkok, without passengers, for further testing. 

The incident has forced police in Thailand to clamp down on the popular custom of flying paper lanterns during celebrations, with a clampdown on all lanterns flying before 9pm.

Speaking to Straits Times Royal Thai Police spokesman Pol Maj-General Prawut Thawornsiri said: 'Police have set clear measures about releasing 'kom loy' (flying lanterns).

'It can be done after 9pm but during the New Year holiday, many people released their lanterns in the evening.'

Past incidents involving floating lanterns impacting air travel and causing delays have resulted in police threatening to invoke the ultimate penalty.

'Releasing paper lanterns near airports can be very dangerous to the safety of aircraft and it is a criminal offence,' said Police Major General Amnuay Nimmano.

Passengers were left stranded at Chaing Mai as the flight was cancelled and further tests were carried out

Thai police have put an exclusion zone around airports for those caught flying fire lanterns

'Those who violate the law will be dealt with accordingly and could face life in prison or the death penalty.'

Back in November for the Yi Peng festival, thousands of lanterns, known as khom loy, lit up the night sky like a swarm of jellyfish

More than 150 flights in and out of Chiang Mai were cancelled or delayed during the peak of the holiday, from November 5 to November 7, affecting around 20,000 passengers.

The air traffic control centre in Chiang Mai province declared a three-mile zone around the airport where people were advised not to launch lanterns during the festival.

Several airlines, including Thai Airways, were forced to their flight schedules to give way to the lantern floating, which takes place mainly after dark.

The festival coincides with Thailand's Loi Krathong festival, during which Thais float small rafts on rivers to ask for forgiveness from the goddess of water. They also believe that launching lanterns will rid them of bad fortune.

Revellers were advised that they may float lanterns near the airport after 9pm, when the air traffic is cleared up.
