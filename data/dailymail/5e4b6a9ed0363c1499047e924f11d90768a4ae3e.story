A group of 20-year-old hoons have been forced to scrub tyre marks off the road after business owners caught them doing burnouts in front of their shop.

The young men were caught red-handed  when the general manager of Territory Marine in Yarrawonga, east of Darwin, heard them screeching up the street late on Friday night.

Fed up with the destruction hoons regularly cause in the area, the business owner and his colleague set out after the five men.  

The five young men caught doing burnouts in Yarrawonga, east of Darwin, on Friday night were forced by a business owner to scrub the road

'They came and did a couple of burnouts that night all around the area. It happens regularly because we're in an industrial area,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'We just had enough, it's made a really mess of the street. We've spent a lot of money making this area look nice.'

The owner asked several people in the area if they knew anything about the hoons whereabouts and they were led directly to a nearby shed.

'People pointed us in the right direction... one of the guys was parked outside the shed and you could still smell the rubber,' he said. 

While he didn't want to elaborate on exactly what was said, the owner told the young men he didn't appreciate the burnouts and told them to come back at 9am ready to clean.

'I knew they would show up and at 9am they did,' he said.

'We made them come back and spend 2.5 hours cleaning in the sun on their knees with kerosene and scrub pads.

'After 2.5 hours, they apologised again and we made them pay for the cleaning stuff.'

The owner said he's never tried a direct approach like before, but will do it again in a heartbeat. 

'I'm pretty confident these guys won't be back. They've learnt their lesson,' he said. 

'If anyone else does (burnouts) near our business, they'll be dealt with personally.'
