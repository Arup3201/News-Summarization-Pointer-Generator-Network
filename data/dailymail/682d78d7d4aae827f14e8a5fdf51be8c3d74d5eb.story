Caught on camera: Julie Peters was filmed carrying shopping bags (pictured) and making deliveries despite claiming £11,000 of disability benefits

A grandmother, who claimed she could not walk, has been caught on camera delivering sandwiches despite receiving £11,000 in disability benefits.

Julie Peters, 56, who runs Victoria Sandwich in Horwich, Bolton, Greater Manchester, was filmed making deliveries and carrying shopping bags, after telling the Department of Work and Pensions she could not walk and claiming benefits for seven years.

The woman from Breightmet, Bolton, was convicted of dishonestly claiming disability living allowance at Manchester City Magistrates' Court, and will be sentenced later after she was caught following a tip-off.

Peters told The Bolton News six years ago that she beat depression following breast cancer surgery by launching the sandwich business with her daughter, Vicki.

Despite bouncing back from breast cancer she became depressed but she said her new business venture had helped her beat the illness.

Victoria Sandwich's website prides itself as being staffed by ‘some of the nicest people you will meet’.

The firm specialises in eat-ins takeaways and buffets.

After she opened the business, Peters said: ‘Vicki and I decided to get a place of our own together, and this gave me a real purpose in life.

‘When I was at my lowest, I just needed to keep strong and positive and find a way forward - I never dreamed that I'd cook up the answer myself.’

Lord Freud, Minister for Welfare Reform said: ‘Benefit thieves are costing the taxpayer £1.2 billion per year.

‘This money is intended to help those most in need not line the pockets of criminals.

‘We will continue to tackle this problem at the frontline, but also at the root by reforming the benefits system to make it less open to abuse.’

Peters will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court in March.

Her sentencing comes as Patrick Wildman, 47, was convicted after he was caught working as a delivery driver while  claiming he could not walk, pocketing £27,000 in benefits.

The former bus driver, who uses a wheelchair was secretly filmed walking around Plymouth, has now been convicted of benefit fraud after pocketing benefits money for over seven years.
