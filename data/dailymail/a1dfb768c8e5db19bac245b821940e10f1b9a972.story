A knock at the door in the middle of the night. A policeman telling you your teenage daughter has been abducted.

They’re trying to find her but she may have already been sold as a sex slave or a child bride. A chance she might be dead. And 270 of her friends have been taken too. Vanished. Inconceivable in this country. Reality in parts of Nigeria.

In Britain and the United States we still have the capacity to be stunned when evil descends on our classrooms. Who could forget? Sixteen boys and girls and a teacher murdered at Dunblane Primary, 12 students and one teacher wiped out at Columbine High, 20 children and six staff shot dead at Sandy Hook Elementary. All of them events of such horrific magnitude they will forever be etched in the world’s collective memory.

Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said he will 'sell' the schoolgirls his terror group kidnapped three weeks ago

These massacres shocked us to our core precisely because they were so out of the ordinary – innocent children gunned down in the supposed safety of their schools. But in Nigeria, where I have been this past week, the bombing, burning and kidnapping of schoolchildren is now almost a regular occurrence. Another day, another outrage. Schools are far from safe havens, and they must be just that.

They have almost become instruments of war, and the brutality inside those walls has become so commonplace it is rarely reported.

Why in God’s name has it taken three weeks for the world to sit up and care about this atrocity?

I once visited a school on the outskirts of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, with Bono. When we asked the children what their ambitions were, we found they were the same as kids all around the world.

Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the international community had to work together to prevent the spread of groups like Boko Haram

Some wanted to be teachers,  doctors and nurses, others engineers, airline pilots and scientists.

None, of course, had ambitions  of being a politician – and to Bono’s surprise, none wanted to be a rock star.

What struck me most during our visit were the appalling conditions and the substandard education they were receiving. Lessons were being offered in a dilapidated school with a leaking, corrugated iron roof. Children huddled together, three or four at a rickety desk built for one.

What we ultimately learned was deeply disturbing. We found this school was losing pupils to a madrasa only a few miles away – a new, fresh, well-financed institution that offered free education.

But the drawback was that they were indoctrinating students by preaching support for terrorism.

Gordon Brown had previously traveled to Nigeria with Irish rock singer Bono where he discovered that extremist schools were offering free education to poor children

So it is no surprise to me that extremism, fed by propaganda infiltrated through the education system, is on the rise in Nigeria.

And now, thankfully, the international community has finally woken up to the fact that 270 girls were snatched at gunpoint from their school.

The murderous terrorist group Boko Haram – the name means ‘Western education is forbidden’ – has claimed responsibility for the abductions, and their twisted leader Abubakar Shekau released a video stating the girls should not have been in school and should be married. A further eight girls were kidnapped last week.

These lives now hang in the balance. Kidnapped and carted off in lorries into the jungle territory of Borno state, their parents are unsure whether they will be used as sex slaves, taken over the border and sold as child brides, or killed.

It is horrendously late but a search, involving the UK and US and using state-of-the-art equipment, will finally begin. Three weeks ago and within hours of the mass abduction, I asked for international support to rescue them.

Thanks to William Hague, our Foreign Secretary, and John Kerry, the US Secretary of State, specialist teams are in place. Last week the world was angry and vocal.

Look to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. This week the world will be watching and praying.And the Nigerian government and their people deserve the fullest support in tackling terrorism. Last week in Abuja, Boko Haram bombed and killed dozens. Over the past four years the group’s attacks on Nigerians have taken more than 4,000 lives.

We also now know that in a separate incident in the past few weeks, seven teachers were murdered and 27 members of their families were abducted in Borno state. Another day, another outrage.

This brings to 171 the number of teachers who have been assassinated in Nigeria since 2009. It makes it all the more important that a Safe Schools Initiative I announced in Abuja on Wednesday – to increase the security available to pupils and teachers in their school grounds – is moved forward as quickly as possible.

We simply cannot stand by and see schools shut down, girls cut off from their education and parents in fear of their daughters’ lives. The education system that has  the potential to transform Nigeria  cannot be undermined.

Starting with a 500-school pilot programme in northern states, the Safe Schools Initiative will focus on school and community interventions, with special measures for the most at-risk  children. The initiative will build community groups to promote safe zones for education, comprising teachers,  parents, police, community leaders and young people.

Ex-Corrie star Julie Hesmondhalgh also gave her support to the international campaign to release the girls

This initiative, which came from the Global Business Coalition For Education led by my wife Sarah, is part of our work to give every girl and boy in Nigeria the opportunity to learn and fulfil their ambitions. Surely in the year 2014, every boy and girl should be at school and no one should be prevented from an education.

Sadly there are still 57 million across the world who are denied even basic schooling.

There ARE children in Nigeria prepared to stand up to terrorism. Last week 12 young Nigerians, appointed global ambassadors by education  initiative A World At School, made a statement showing that they will not be cowed by terrorist threats. They declared they will continue their work for the right of every child to go to school safely.

And Nigeria is not the only country at risk. More than two million out-of-school children are growing up in conflict zones, whether it be the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the fringes of Burma, or in South Sudan, and all of them are vulnerable to extremist influences as we cut global education aid year after year.

All the world’s aid put together offers sub-Saharan Africa only $13 per pupil per year – barely enough to buy one school book per child. Faced with a rising school-age population, Nigeria receives just $2 per pupil, but it needs to spend $2 billion a year more if it is  to meet the UN Millennium Development goal that every child be at school by 2015.

I also now believe that discrimination against girls has become the civil rights struggle of our times. Thankfully, millions of girls across the world are now prepared to stand up for their rights.

A few weeks ago I returned to Pakistan 18 months after a visit I made following the shooting of Malala Yousafzai. Then, there was rage that a young girl could be shot simply for wanting girls to go to school. A whole population almost seemed fearful and cowed by the Taliban.

However, on my recent trip, addressing 2,000 girls who had turned out in Islamabad, I found a determination that no girl should ever be forced out of their country by the Taliban again. None of them wanted their country to be defined to the world any more by a shooting. They wanted Pakistan  recognised not by their failure to get girls to school but by their success.

These socially aware girls, desperate for education and careers, are globalisation’s children – born in the latest wave of change, aware, through their mobile phone contact with the outside world, of the opportunities girls enjoy elsewhere. Their outrage at the denial of opportunity could threaten over the coming  decade to bring unresponsive  governments to their knees.

A generation ago, young  people might have accepted that their rights were what others bestowed on them, their opportunities simply what parents and grandparents handed down, and that a shortage of ability, not a shortage of opportunity, explained their fate.

Now not so, and probably never again. They are fighting back but there will be moments of despair on their journey.

In Chibok this past week, it has been heartbreaking to see the desolation on faces as they wait for news about the girls.

We should be taking even more action. Schools that already have the same legal rights under international law as hospitals should also be the subject of agreements that they never become instruments of war. They should be as safe as the hospitals that have Red Crosses on them and the UN buildings and vehicles that bear the blue UN symbol.

Perpetrators of terrorist crimes against children should be aware that murdering or abducting them is a heinous crime that the authorities will punish. Even in the world’s most dangerous places, we must now establish the right of all children to schooling and make a new idea of ‘education without borders’ a reality.

And while we cannot end terrorism overnight, we can show determination to stand up to it by making schools safe and defending every child’s right to education… and to life.
