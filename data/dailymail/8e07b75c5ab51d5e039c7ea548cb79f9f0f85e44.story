A pair of Hollywood actors who were pulled over and handcuffed by the police during a trip to South Carolina claim they were targeted by officers because they are black.

Cherie Johnson and Dennis White were apparently accused of possessing marijuana - even though Ms Johnson once fronted a national anti-drugs campaign - and asked if they were carrying a dead body in the trunk of their car.

Local police have now launched an investigation into the couple's allegations, which have sparked widespread outrage amidst concerns of racial profiling by police in the state.

Ms Johnson, 37, is best known for her long-running roles in sitcoms Punky Brewster and Family Matters, while Mr White appeared in 2009 hit Notorious.

The pair, who live in Los Angeles, had been conducting an acting workshop in Mr White's hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina before the incident on September 22, they told CNN iReport.

They were driving to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for a short vacation when they were pulled over for driving at 40mph in a 25mph zone, and issued with a speeding ticket.

As they continued along the highway after the traffic stop, they noticed a cotton field by the side of the road and decided to stop and take photographs, as Ms Johnson had never seen cotton plants before.

Mr White told CNN that the pair were moved by the symbolism of seeing cotton which would once have been picked by slaves, adding that they reflected on 'the oppression that those little white balls created decades ago'.

As they returned to their rental car, they noticed that a police car had stopped next to them, and Ms Johnson told the policeman inside: 'I just wanted to take a picture!'

The couple claimed that the officer, Shad Barfield, then picked up his gun and ordered them to sit in their car.

He apparently proceeded to interrogate them, asking if they had drugs and telling Ms Johnson that a warrant was out for her arrest, although he soon admitted that this was not true.

She told HLN: 'After he told me that I did not have a warrant for my arrest, and he started asking me about drugs for the third time, I said, "Are you doing this because we're black?" And that was when everything took a turn for the worse.'

Mr Barfield put both actors in handcuffs, although they were not under arrest, and continued to accuse them of carrying marijuana - even though Ms Johnson was a representative for the Say No to Drugs campaign in the 1980s.

After the officer suggested that they might be hiding a dead body in the trunk of their car, Mr Dennis agreed that he could search the vehicle.

Mr Barfield accused him of having a bag of marijuana, but was forced to back down when Mr Dennis pointed out that it was in fact a tea bag.

When the policeman did not find anything illegal in the car, he released the couple and allowed them to leave, but they say he did not apologise for detaining them.

Mr White told CNN: 'At no point in history is this justified, especially not in this day and age. The equality that our forefathers fought so hard to obtained does not stretched across the board.'

After being told of the incident, Marion County sheriff Mark Richardson said: 'Discrimination in any form, including racial profiling, is strictly prohibited by this department and as Sheriff of Marion County SC, I can assure you I will take immediate and appropriate action to investigate the allegations of racial profiling made by Mr White and Ms Johnson.

'This matter will be dealt with by an internal investigation within the department and I will also ask the State Law Enforcement Division to review the allegation made against Deputy Barfield.'
