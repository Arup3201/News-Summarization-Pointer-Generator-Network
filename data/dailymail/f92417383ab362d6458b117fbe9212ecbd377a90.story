So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

Hands Off In The Box is Sportsmail's new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Here, our reporters kept their eye on any incidents from Tuesday night's Capital One Cup fixtures.

LIVERPOOL 2-1 SWANSEA

Dominic King at Anfield 

If anything, both these sides were guilty of being too generous with the space they afforded each other, as shown by Dejan Lovren’s late header.

SHREWSBURY 1-2 CHELSEA

Laurie Whitwell at the New Meadow

Gary Cahill managed to avoid any headlocks in attacking corners and was well behaved when defending them. Nothing needing the attentions of referee Neil Swarbrick here as Andrew mangan scored when he was held by Filipe Luis.  

FULHAM 2-5 DERBY

Jack Gaughan at Craven Cottage

Derby skipper Richard Keogh manhandled Stephen Arthurworrey at a corner but the Fulham defender wriggled free and almost put the hosts ahead.

BOURNEMOUTH 2-1 WEST BROM

Riath Al-Samarrai at the Goldsands Stadium

Eager to cut out the Bournemouth threat, West Brom defenders occasionally grabbed hold of their men. Craig Dawson and Gareth McAuley were both happy to get close at corners.

MK DONS 1-2 SHEFFIELD UNITED

There was plenty of grappling as Sheffield United defended a corner early in the second half but it went unpunished by referee Roger East.
