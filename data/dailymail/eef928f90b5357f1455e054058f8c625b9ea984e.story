A California couple who were held in Qatar for nearly two years before they were cleared in the death of their eight-year-old daughter have sued the engineering firm that sent them overseas.

Matt and Grace Huang, who finally returned home to Los Angeles last Thursday, filed a negligence and wrongful termination suit against Colorado-based company MWH Global on Monday.

Mr Huang, who had worked for the firm since 1999, was sent to Qatar to help improve the country's drainage systems ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the Los Angeles Times reported.

But the suit claims that it failed to provide security or cultural training in Qatar, where mixed-race families are not accepted. The couple are Asian American and had adopted three black children from Africa.

Freed: Matthew and Grace Huang, who arrived back in the U.S. on Thursday after a two-year legal battle following the sudden death of their adopted daughter, have sued the company that sent them there

In the suit, the Huangs said that adoption is prohibited and East Asians are regarded as one of the lowest 'racial classes of individuals'. They added that the firm had 'abandoned them'.

Following the sudden death of their daughter Gloria, who suffered an eating disorder after being malnourished as a young child, authorities accused them of adopting the children to harvest their organs, the couple said. Police said the Huangs had starved Gloria to death. 

MWH says it checked on the family's welfare and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Matt Huang's defense.

It also says that Huang resigned after they offered him a leave of absence from his job. 

The family's ordeal began in January 2013, when Gloria  started foaming at the mouth, her father told CBS News in an interview. He tried to save her but she passed away in hospital.

Without carrying out a full autopsy of the girl, Qatari police turned their attention to the parents, who are of Asian descent. They were suspicious of the mixed-race family, the couple said.

An initial police report raised questions about why the couple would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits'.

'They thought we were human traffickers,' Matthew said. 'They said we adopted our children to either harvest their organs or to do medical tests on them.' 

Grace added: 'For me, the hardest part, I think, was being asked over and over, 'Are you the real mom?''

Prosecutors said the couple denied food to their daughter and locked her in her room at night, but he Huangs said Gloria suffered from medical problems complicated by an eating disorder that was the result of her impoverished early years in Africa.

They were thrown in jail and the boys were sent to a Qatari orphanage for four months. While locked up, Matt said that he was physically and sexually assaulted while in prison. 

Their case was finally heard for the first time in November 2013 and they were convicted of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison. 

But after a year in prison, holes started to emerge in the prosecution's case and a judge granted them bail.

A forensic pathologist hired by the family concluded there was 'no medical evidence' that the girl was starved by her parents and a proper autopsy was never carried out. 

During that time, the U.S. State Department called the case 'unfair' but failed to lobby for their release - and Matthew said he wonders if that was political. 

'The U.S. government could have done a lot more, a lot quicker,' he told CBS. 'Qatar is such an important military base -- for the U.S. I felt like the U.S. government was unwilling to rock the boat and unwilling to make a strong stance with knowing that we were innocent.'

But the department argued that Secretary Kerry had discussed it with the foreign minister.

Then last Sunday, a Qatari judge finally overturned their conviction - but their passports were confiscated at the airport later that day.

Their situation remained tense until the moment of their departure Wednesday, with Mr Huang being detained for several minutes at the airport's passport control station as his wife watched in tears.

Back home:The couple was reunited with their children and other relatives after they landed on Thursday

They finally arrived back in Los Angeles on Thursday.

'Mission accomplished. Matt and Grace are in Los Angeles,' The David House Agency, which represents them, tweeted. 'They have not stopped smiling.'

The couple said they are relieved to be home and were pictured with their two sons at their Pasadena church on Sunday.

'It was just nice to be there with our church family again,' Grace said. 'But at the same time, we were just sitting in our usual order with the kids in between us, but there was just one who was missing.'
