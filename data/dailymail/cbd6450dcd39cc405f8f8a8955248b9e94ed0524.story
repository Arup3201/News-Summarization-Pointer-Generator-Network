Lightning does strike twice: Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) has been the victim of the same fraud scheme twice in the past decade

It has been revealed that U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) is the victim of an investing scam - and this isn't the first time he's been swindled.

Mr Grayson was cheated out of $18million by William Dean Chapman, who cheated a total of 120 people out of $35million in the fraud. The revelations came as Mr Chapman was jailed Monday for 12 years.

This is not the first time fraudsters have taken advantage of the Florida Democrat. In 2009,  he won a $34million judgement against a separate firm running a nearly identical fraud.

The scheme worked like this: clients 
would turn over their stocks to Mr Chapman as collateral for a loan, he would then let customers borrow about 90 per cent of the stocks' 
value.

If the stocks did 
badly, borrowers could walk away and keep the money they were loaned. 
But if the borrowers' stocks did well, they would repay the loan with 
interest, and Mr Chapman was supposed to return the stocks to the investor 
at their increased value.

Mr Grayson's stocks performed 
astronomically well while they were entrusted to Mr Chapman and his 
company, Alexander Capital Markets.

This is where the scheme began to unravel - Mr Chapman sold the stocks and had no way to fulfill his obligations - the self-styled investment guru had no way to make successful investors whole, prosecutors said.

'That's why [Mr Chapman] is going to prison
 for a long, long time,' said Mr Grayson. 'At least in the end, some kind 
of justice was served.'

In most of the court papers, Mr Grayson's identity is protected — prosecutors say only that an elected official with the initials A.G. was the primary victim — but documents twice mention Grayson by name. The Democratic congressman on Monday confirmed he is the A.G. mentioned in the documents.

Nothing in the court papers suggests Mr Grayson was anything but a victim of the scheme.

Lawyers for the congressman said it was the strength of his stocks that caused the scheme to crumble. The two men negotiated a payment plan, according to court records, but it was not enough to keep Mr Chapman's positions from collapsing.

In 2007, Grayson had $9.35 million in a 
stock portfolio that Chapman was supposed to be holding as collateral. 
In that year alone, the portfolio's value increased by 147 per cent, to 
$23 million, according to a chart in the court documents.

'Because the return on A.G.'s commodities investments were so astronomical, ACM could not meet its obligations under the loan agreements' defense lawyer Whitney Minter wrote.

Mr Grayson has a long record of successfully picking stocks, many of which have contributed to his fortune.

The con artist instead used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle including a Lamborghini, a Ferrari and a $3 million home, prosecutors said.

Mr Chapman, of Sterling, Va., pleaded 
guilty in May but tried at Friday's sentencing hearing to withdraw the 
plea, saying he felt pressured to plead and that he never intended to 
defraud.

He is not the first stock scammer to take advantage of Mr Grayson.

Double trouble: Mr Grayson also fell for a similar scheme only a few years ago, that once cost him almost twice as much as the latest fraud

In 2009, Mr Grayson won a $34 million judgment after filing a lawsuit in South Carolina under federal racketeering laws against a company called Derivium Capital. Derivium's business plan for hedging an investor's stock profile was nearly identical to the plan outline by Mr Chapman.

Mr Grayson said he first entered into deals with Mr Chapman in 2003, well before the deal with Derivium went south, so he had no reason to be suspicious of the arrangement.

The loans themselves were a perfectly reasonable way to manage his portfolio, but relied on Mr Chapman and Derivium to hold up their end of the bargain, he said, disputing that the astronomical returns to which he was entitled caused Mr Chapman's downfall.

'If they had not sold the collateral, it all would have worked,' he explained, who is generally listed as one of the 20 wealthiest members of Congress with assets of more than $20 million. His financial disclosure forms list holdings in dozens of stocks. His dealings with Mr Chapman preceded his time in Congress, which began in 2009.

Court records indicate Mr Chapman's firm was drawing regulatory scrutiny as early as 2007.

Before he was elected to Congress, Mr Grayson practiced law and was best known for winning a major whistleblower lawsuit exposing fraud on a government contract in Iraq.
