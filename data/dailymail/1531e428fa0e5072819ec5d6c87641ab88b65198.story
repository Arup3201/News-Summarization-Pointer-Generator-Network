Super-agent Jorge Mendes has ruffled a few feathers after claiming that only his client, the 'genius' Jose Mourinho, is capable of taking over Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious legacy at Manchester United. 

Ferguson, who won 38 trophies in 26 years at the Old Trafford club, retired as manager in 2013 and was replaced by David Moyes.

Moyes, however, did not enjoy a successful reign and was dismissed by the club before the end of his first season, with United faltering in seventh in the Premier League table.

Mendes' list of clients includes  Mourinho, David de Gea, Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria

United turned to Louis van Gaal last summer, a proven winner on the continent, as the big name to take the club forward.

His side are third in the Premier League table with 43 points,10 behind the pace of leaders Chelsea, were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by League Two Side MK Dons, and required a replay to edge past another League Two team Cambridge United in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

Mendes told the BBC: 'It's completely impossible to find someone like Sir Alex Ferguson because he's a god, he's a genius and to find a genius is very difficult.  

Di Maria arrived at Manchester United from Real Madrid for a reported £58.7 million fee in the summer

'You have one in England – Jose Mourinho. Having Sir Alex Ferguson ensures at this moment you have 12 or 15 points more. He's finished his career, but he's someone that makes the difference.'

Mendes admitted, though, it was unlikely that Mourinho, who is in a second spell in charge of Chelsea, will leave Stamford Bridge any time soon.  

'Jose will stay for sure,' said Mendes. 'He will be the Sir Alex Ferguson of Chelsea Football Club. He loves the supporters, he loves the city and I think he will stay there for more than 10 years.' 

So far, Louis van Gaal's first season in charge of Manchester United has been a little underwhelming

Another of Mendes' clients, United goalkeeper David de Gea has just 18 months to run on his Old Trafford deal and is wanted by Real Madrid. But Mendes offered reassurances to United fans.

'He has one year left on his contract and I think he will stay in Manchester,' Mendes said. 'The player will decide, but he's happy there at the moment.'
