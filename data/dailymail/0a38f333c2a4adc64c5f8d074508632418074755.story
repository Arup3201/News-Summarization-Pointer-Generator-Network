It's a bona fide industry that is, officially, only five days old - but represents hundreds of millions of dollars.

As Colorado comes close to closing out the first week of its 'green rush', with recreational marijuana stores legally allowed to sell the drug from January 1 under revolutionary new state laws, official sales figures and profit margins have started rolling in.

'Adult use' pot is projected to be a $208 million industry in Colorado this year - on top of the $250 million projected to be spent on medical marijuana, Betty Aldworth, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CNN.

One business alone, the Lodo Wellness Center in Denver, which is described as a 'boutique' marijuana store that is cash-only, recorded $10,000 in sales in the first few hours of Wednesday.

While the owners, married couple Donald and Linda Andrews - who started the store in 2000 as a medical marijuana dispensary, foreseeing the substance one day becoming legal -Â  told CNN they made more in one day than they would normally in one month.

Although not divulging the figure, the pair said they served about 1,000 customers, with the majority buying an eighth of an ounce, priced between $40 and $50.

The estimated total sits around $50,000 for day one.

In all, about $1 million in business was done at about 35 pot shops on the first day of marijuana's legalization in Colorado, Aldworth estimated, giving each an average first day earning of $28,000.

While that business is unlikely to continue, with people flying in from all over the country, as well as Canada and Australia, to be among the historic first to buy legal weed, pot shop owners are looking to increase their number of plants several-fold.

All business must grow their own marijuana, under the laws.

All plants are grown indoors, and the law limits to six the number of plants grown under each light fixture.

The Medicine Man dispensary in Denver, the largest in the state, has 5,000 plants, meaning an operation of over 830 lights, and are looking to triple their plant stock to 15,000.

Evergreen Apothecary in Denver served 400 customers on opening day and now plans to increase its plants from 2,000 to as many as 24,000.

'This is unquestionably a tremendous growth industry,' Aldworth said.

'There hasn't been an opportunity like this in American history in quite some time.

'The tech boom had an impact on the American economy, but I think this could rival it.

'We're not creating a market out of nothing.

'We are just shifting it from the underground market.'

Nationwide, government-regulated marijuana is projected to double this year, to $2.3 billion from about $1 billion last year.

That 2013 figure came solely from medical marijuana sales in more than a dozen states.

Several states are creating the growth.

Colorado and Washington are the first two states with legalized recreational marijuana, and Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon will allow medical cannabis shops to open in 2014.

Washington's recreational weed will go on sale later this year.

Pot promises to be such big business that advocates are planning voter initiatives for legalizing recreational use in several other states by 2016.
