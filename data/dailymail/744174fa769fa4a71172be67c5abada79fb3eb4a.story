A woman wielding a shotgun forced her 7-year-old son to jump out of a second-floor St. Petersburg, Florida, apartment window early Thursday before she jumped as well in an apparent suicide attempt, police said.

According to authorities, 7-year-old Oscar Vail said his mother, Michelle Vail, said a serial killer was after the family.

Spokeswoman Yolando Fernandez said police got a distress call from the 32-year-old woman around 6:30 a.m. She told the dispatcher that her ex-boyfriend was at the door and she needed help.

Officers arrived at the apartment a short time later, but Vail wouldn't let them in, saying she didn't believe they were police officers, Fernandez said.

'She was babbling incoherently, none of it made any sense,' Fernandez said.

The St. Petersburg Police Department said in a news release 'The caller, Michelle Vail, said that a former boyfriend was standing outside her door and she was fearful that he was going to kill her. 

'Vail also said that she [was] armed and officers arriving on the scene determined that she was in possession of a shotgun.' 

Police also 'noted that she appeared distraught and seemed mentally unstable,' the release said.

As officers walked away, they heard the sound of glass breaking. They returned and could see that Vail had a shotgun and was banging it against a door and a wall.

Fernandez said officers heard the boy scream. At that point they knocked down the door, but by the time they reached a back room, the child and mother had already jumped.

Oscar was taken to a hospital, where officials say he is in stable condition and being kept for observation.

His mother's injuries were superficial, according to Fernandez.

The news release said that 'The child was interviewed by detectives at the hospital and stated his mother had told him that a serial killer was coming to get them and he needed to jump out the window, which he did.'

The family recently moved from Ormond Beach, Florida, to the area, police said. 

Police told WTSP that three weapons - a handgun, large knife and a shotgun - were discovered in the apartment.

Vail is being charged with one count of aggravated child abuse. It wasn't known whether she's hired a lawyer who could comment on the case.

The St. Petersburg Police Department said that the Department of Children and Families was contacted in order to arrange custody for Oscar upon his release. 

WTSP reported that the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office Child Protection Investigation Division is now investigating.
