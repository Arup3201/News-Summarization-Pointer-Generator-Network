A heroic teacher talked a shooter, aged just 12, into dropping his weapon this morning, just moments after the child walked into a packed gymnasium and opened fire at his classmates, leaving a 12-year-old boy fighting for life and a 13-year-old girl in serious condition.

After the first shots rang out at Berrendo Middle School, the unidentified educator was quick to react, throwing himself towards the armed youngster and convincing him to lay his shotgun on the ground, New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Roswell ISD superintendent Tom Burris revealed in a Tuesday afternoon press conference.

'The student was quickly stopped by one staff member who walked right up to him and asked him to put down the firearm which he did,' Governor Martinez told reporters.

Burris added: 'In the 10 seconds that transpired from the time this thing started until the teacher had control of the weapon there was no cowardice, there was protection for our kids.'

The two victims were first taken to Eastern New Mexico Medical Center and then airlifted to the University of Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, where the young man reportedly told nurses he was the target of the shocking 
spray of bullets. He was undergoing surgery this afternoon.

A teacher also suffered minor injuries but refused medical aid so he could stay on to assist at the scene.

Roswell police announced soon after the shooting that the suspect had been arrested at the campus and was in custody.

At the press conference, New Mexico state police chief Pete N. Kassetas said the drama unfolded at the school around 7:30 a.m.

'(The suspect) walked into the gymnasium. We believe the weapon was concealed in a bag and it wasn't known about until right before he started shooting,' he said.

Witnesses said the 12-year-old victim was shot in the face, though officials refused to confirm this.

Kassetas said the school's principal recognized a NM state police lieutenant who was dropping off his own child as she locked the door and asked for his help. However, when he arrived inside the gym, the weapon was already on the ground.

He went on to applaud the bravery of school officials.

'It is one thing for a police officer whose job this is to intervene but for a teacher or staff member to intervene, I commend the principal and the teachers and people at this school for saving many more lives,' he said.

Kassetas said detectives were conducting interviews with over 100 students and faculty as part of the investigation but they were confident the 12-year-old was acting alone.

He didn't know a motive at this stage and said officers had been in touch with the parents of the suspected shooter and both victims.

Superintendent Burris insisted security at his schools was not to blame and said the incident came as a total shock to all.

'We come to school daily thinking we are going to educate our kids and lead them but we never think things like today will ever happen,' he said. 'And they do.'

Roswell Mayor Jere Wood told reporters he was devastated by the news and called for an end to such senseless acts of violence.

'We were saddened this morning when we heard of the shooting we were saddened for the victims and their injuries and the hurt it has brought to the community of Roswell,' he said, offering up any resources the ISD required for things like counseling.

Earlier, Gabriel Tortillo, a 7th grade student at Berrendo, told the Albuquerque Journal he saw a male student carrying a gun. He said that student shot a boy in the eye area.

Sixth grade student Anyssa Vegara said she was talking to a security guard when she heard the shot.

'I turned around and all I saw was someone on the floor with their arm bleeding,' the student said.

Shooter: No information about the shooter or the type of weapon used has been released

She said the security guard ran to help the injured student, and school officials ordered all the students to their classrooms.

It was earlier reported that there were 
at least four victims, but the injured kids appeared to have been counted twice - 
once at each hospital.

Roswell PD posted word of the shooting on its Facebook page not long after 8 a.m. local time.

The
 school was placed on lockdown and children were bused from the school 
to a nearby mall where their terrified parents came to collect them.

Eventually, Anyssa was able to text her mother, Monica Vegara.

'From the time hearing about it, until the time she texted, it was a nightmare,' the panicked mother told the Journal.

'... this incident is being 
investigated. There are many resources and law enforcement officers on 
scene securing the area,' he added.

No
 information about the shooter or the type of weapon used has been 
officially released. One news outlet reported that he was male and aged 
around 13.

Roswell City Councilor Savino Sanchez said he found out about the shooting after receiving a phone call.

He said once news of the shooting spread
 throughout town, residents began to worry. 'I know a lot of people are 
concerned,' he said.

Troy J. Sanders tweeted Tuesday: 'Please
 pray for my cousin. She was one of the two students shot today at 
Berrendo Middle School.'

Roswell has been rocked by gang violence in recent years and has asked Homeland Security Investigations to step in and help.

The city has a population of about 50,000. It a center for ranching and farming and is home to the New Mexico Military Institute, the only state-supported military college in the West. The city is perhaps best known as the site of an alleged UFO crash in 1947.

A prayer vigil is being held at 6 p.m. local time Tuesday evening.

Governor Martinez added: 'Please don't forget this community is a strong community. There is no doubt they will pull together.'
