A hilarious video of a bear taking a dip in a family swimming pool has been making waves across the world.

The YouTube clip, which has attracted more than 17,000 views, shows the animal splashing about after climbing into the backyard of the Gasparinis' home in Monrovia, California.

Shocked teenage sisters Valerie and Rachel could not believe their eyes when they saw the animal lower itself into the water outside their house.

Bear-ing all: Valerie and Rachel Gasparini could not believe their eyes when they saw the animal climb in to their swimming pool

Grizzly sight: The girls filmed the splashing bear on a camera phone - and 'Larry' has now found fame across the world

The siblings, who were at their luxurious home alone, decided to film the bear idly paddling in the water as they watched in amazement.

They recorded the remarkable episode from the safety of their kitchen, filming the action through a window on a camera phone.

The girls can be heard laughing in surprise, saying, 'This is crazy!' and 'It's pretty good at swimming!'

Both entranced and frightened by the sight, the pair compare the trespassing creature to a person, giggling at how it appears to be admiring the beautiful view as it enjoys a relaxing cool-down in the circular pool.

The bear - who the Gasparini sisters dubbed 'Larry' - has found instant fame, and the video has appeared on ABC, CBS, KTLA, and Good Morning America.

'It kind of like walks over to the pool, and we thought it was gonna 
drink some water,' said Rachel afterwards, according to KTLA.

'It ends up jumping over the ledge, and it's kind of like floating around there, chilling.'

The bear appears to be sitting on the built-in underwater stools during its five-minute visit. After paddling through the water for a short time, it wandered off back into the wild, without causing any damage.

But the brave siblings were not too worried by the sight of the potentially dangerous beast.

Valerie said: 'It wasn't any making a ruckus or it wasn't like destroying things in our backyard, so we didn't really feel the need to call anybody.'

Rachel added: 'Yeah, it was more of entertainment than a scare.'

Just as well, because the sisters were expecting a visitor at any moment - and he could have faced a closer encounter.
