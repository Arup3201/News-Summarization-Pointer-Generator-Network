The architects behind the stunning Tower of London poppies installation claimed last night they would be snubbed by Turner Prize judges for not being part of the art elite.

Artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper - who worked on the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red project - said they would be shunned for being a ‘Derby-based artist’ and ‘theatre designer’.

Mr Cummins also hit out at comments made by former Turner Prize judge Jonathan Jones that the memorial was ‘toothless’ - and the moat of the Tower ‘should be filled with barbed wire and bones’.

Not in the art elite: Artist Paul Cummins (above) said he would be shunned for being a 'Derby-based artist'

Mr Cummins, 37, who lost a finger making one of the poppies, told the Guardian that a Turner nomination was ‘not going to happen’, but probably would have done ‘if it had been anyone else’.

And he said of the controversial article by Mr Jones, printed in the same newspaper in October: ‘It was a massive shame that certain people had to force their own opinions on other people.

‘It would have ended up looking like The Rocky Horror Show if we’d have done what he wanted.’

And Mr Piper told the newspaper: ‘It has spoken to something very personal in people and allowed them to engage in their emotions. 

‘And the people who couldn’t see that, I just feel they didn’t open themselves up to what it was all about. They felt they had to make some intellectual comment about it, when actually it was so simple and beautiful.’

The article by Mr Jones - published two months ago here - was also criticised by Daily Mail columnist Robert Hardman, who asked in an article: 'Why DO the Left despise patriotism?'

It was reported last month that Mr Cummins and Mr Piper were in line for gongs in the Queen's New Year’s honours list, with the pair most likely to be appointed OBEs for services to the arts.

Nearly five million people flocked to view the installation ahead of Remembrance Sunday. Mr Cummins said the project was inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town.

Mr Piper, a theatrical designer with the Royal Shakespeare Company, helped devise the exhibit and was instrumental in creating two of its key elements.

These were the Weeping Willow - a cascade of poppies which spills from a window of the castle - and the Wave - which swirls out of the moat to form an arch over the entrance to the Tower.

The team began producing the flowers - each of which took three days to make - at an 8,000ft factory in Derby in January.

Each of the 888,246 poppies, which filled the moat of the Tower for Remembrance Day, represented a British or Commonwealth casualty of the First World War.

The artwork, marking the centenary of the outbreak of war in 1914, captured the public imagination and was visited by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, as well as Princes William and Harry. 

The poppies were removed last month and are mostly being sent out to people who have bought them for £25 each.

Previously, Mr Cummins has said: ‘I read through wills of First World War soldiers and came across one man who said everyone he knew had been killed. He wrote of “blood swept lands and seas of red, where angels dare to tread”. It read like a poem and it just seemed to fit.’

The artist, who is studying for a PhD at Derby University, added: ‘This is the biggest thing I have done. I am amazed that people have taken it to heart.’

The Turner Prize is a contemporary art award given annually to ‘a British artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in the 12 months preceding’.
