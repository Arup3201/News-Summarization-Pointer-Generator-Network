Police are investigating the death of a horse in Florida that appears to have been slaughtered for her meat.

The owners arrived at their barn in Hialeah Gardens in Miami-Dade County on Wednesday afternoon after leaving the animal, named Pootie, happy and healthy the day before.

But what they found shocked them to the core.

Not only had the horse been killed, but also gutted.

Shocking: A horse found dead at a barn in Hialeah Gardens, Florida, was slaughtered for her meat, it appears

Brutal: The horse was found dead on Wednesday by its owner. It had also been gutted

'That's not human,' owner Rolando Serrano told NBC 6.

'I don't know who could do that to an animal.'

Mr Serrano said he didn't realize what had happened when he first found the horse, believing it to be another animal that had come onto his land.

'Then I got closer and realized it was my horse,' he said.

'My wife was in tears.'

New pet: Owner Rolando Serrano (pictured) said he had only had the horse for one month 

Scene: There were other horses being held at the barn, however they were not injured

Investigation: Police are looking into what happened to seven-year-old horse Pootie

Upset: Mr Serrano said he can't understand how someone could hurt an animal in such a way

Mr Serrano had only had the white horse for one month.

He said was seven-years-old.

Police were at the scene on Wednesday night looking for clues.

Mr Serrano has other horses at the barn that were not hurt.
