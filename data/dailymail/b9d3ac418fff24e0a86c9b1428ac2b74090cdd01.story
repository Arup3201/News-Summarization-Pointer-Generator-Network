It's designed for racing but this Scuderia Ferrari didn't fare so well on a Perth freeway.

The $573,000 car was spotted smashed up on an embankment after a late night spin went wrong.

Its mystery owner luckily suffered nothing more than a huge dent to their wallet after they lost control of the supercar just before 1am on Wednesday.

However, the shiny red limited edition Ferrari 430 Scuderia car was found in a sorry state - with the front bumper completely demolished.
