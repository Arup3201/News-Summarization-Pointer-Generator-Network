A crazed stalker who tried to give a CBS journalist an apple has agreed to spend 90 days in a psychiatric facility in a bid to avoid a jail sentence. 

Richard Pagani, 30, pleaded guilty to the third degree stalking of CBS anchor Diane Macedo, consenting to a three-month stay in a Coney Island Hospital. 

The New Yorker posted photographs of Macedo on his Facebook and Twitter accounts.

Pagani even took photgraphs of Macedo while she was appearing on television before positing them online

He even took photographs of Macedo appearing on television and uploaded them onto the internet. 

In one bizarre Facebook post, Pagani claimed: 'I'm surprised my c*** didn't fall out of my pants when I saw you on television.' 

On one occasion, Pagani approached Macedo while she was covering the funeral of a police officer and tried to give her an apple. 

When she wouldn't accept the fruit, Pagani slammed it against the news van. 

He also tried to visit Macedo at the CBS office in Manhatten.  

Pagaini also posted some images on Twitter where he claimed not to be talking about an unnamed individual

In a later post, Pagani took a photograph of himself, posted it on the internet describing himself as 'stir crazy' 

Pagani also retweeted a selfie posted on the internet by Macedo's colleague Andrea Grymes, left

According to the NY Post, Judge Lisa Sokoloff asked Pagani at Manhattan Criminal Court: 'Do you admit when you saw her sitting inside the news van you approached the van, knocked on the window and offered her and her colleague an apple and when she refused to acknowledge your presence you slammed the apple into the hood?'

He replied: 'Yes.'

Judge Sokoloff warned Pagani that he would be sent to prison if he attempted to contact Macedo again.

Judge Lisa Solkoff ordered Pagani to spend 90 days in a psychiatric institution

He was also ordered to avoid contacting Pagani either in person or over the internet or face prison
