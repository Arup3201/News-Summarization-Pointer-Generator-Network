Two English hotels have scooped prizes at the 2015 Tatler Travel Awards.

The Pig on the Beach at Studland Bay, Dorset, was honoured for its locally sourced menu, while the Ham Yard Hotel in London’s Soho was handed the ‘Most Fun Ever’ award.

Judges at the magazine praised the Ham Yard Hotel’s restaurant, vibrant decoration and the vintage bowling alley that has been installed inside the building.

The  Pig on the Beach, a 23-bedroom country house, was awarded the 'Feast and Flop' prize, with Tatler's judges remarking that the hotel was a 'home-grown marvel'.

They added that guests 'come to feast - on locally-sourced everything, from just-landed lobsters and salad plucked from the kitchen garden, to home-smoked cod and chargrilled cuttlefish, and rhubarb cheesecake - all before collapsing in the scrumptious rooms.' 

The two hotels beat off competition from a host of the world’s most luxurious venues.

The Grand Hotel Tremezzo on Italy’s Lake Como was named as the most romantic hotel, while the Anassa Hotel in Neo Chorio, Cyprus, won the prize for the best family hotel. 

There were also prizes for The Brando resort in Tetiaroa, French Polynesia, which claimed the ‘Brains and Beauty’ prize for its eco-friendly credentials.

The Velaa Private Island resort at Noonu Atoll in The Maldives was handed one of the evening’s top prizes, scooping the ‘Blockbuster Villa’ award for its spectacular setting, with Tatler praising it as ‘the most beautiful place you could ever sleep in’

The Grand Hotel Tremezzo on Italy’s Lake Como was named as the most romantic hotel 

The magazine said: ‘A certain Hollywood star was behind this private slice of paradise on the other side of the world. 

'He was a heartthrob and a screen legend, but few people know that he was also something of an eco-warrior. 

'And his pristine island escape is now just as he envisaged: drop-dead gorgeous but with conservation at its heart. The heartthrob? Marlon Brando.'

The Velaa Private Island resort at Noonu Atoll in The Maldives was handed one of the evening’s top prizes, scooping the ‘Blockbuster Villa’ award for its spectacular setting, with Tatler praising it as ‘the most beautiful place you could ever sleep in’.

The magazine said: ‘Who would have thought that a humble surf lodge on a little-known island would grab our attention and steal our hearts? It's no longer just a humble surf lodge, though.

‘It has incredible villas and fancy food and the most charming staff you'll ever meet - most of them from the island, as the hotel is all about involving and helping the local community. This place has style and it has soul.'

The ‘Out of this World’ award went to the Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp in the Namib Desert in Namibia.

The US Mustang Mounment resort was honoured with the ‘Into the Wild’ award for adventurous and spectacular setting in the Nevada Desert

The ‘Out of this World’ award went to the Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp in the Namib Desert in Namibia

The judges said: ‘This place is all about the location, in the wildest, driest of deserts where elephant and oryx roam over red sand dunes. But it's also about design - polished concrete and glass and the cleverest, most visually stunning tents you've ever seen. It is, quite simply, out of this world.'

The Mustang Mounment hotel in the US was honoured with the ‘Into the Wild’ award for adventurous and spectacular setting in the Nevada Desert, with the magazine remarking: 'This is not a hotel. This is a vision - the vision of its owner, who cares madly for the wild horses that she's given refuge to.

‘It is thoughtful, and stylish, and a proper adventure - with teepees, and mountain rides and gorgeous cowboys all over the place. And horses - lots and lots of saved, happy Mustang horses.'
