This is what a marathon in the sky looks like – and it isn’t pretty.

Hundreds of ‘vertical’ runners put themselves through complete exhaustion when they raced to the top of Beijing’s tallest building this week.

China World Trade Center Tower 3, an 82-storey behemoth, rules the Chinese capital’s skyline with a height of 1,082ft and while many of the athletes managed to conquer it, some failed to scale its 2,041 steps because they were too tired to continue.

In a major test of endurance, elite runner Piotr Lobodzinski of Poland was the first to cross the rooftop finish line in the second annual China World Summit Wing Hotel Vertical Run.

As his tired legs started to wobble, he grabbed the finish line ribbon and triumphantly raised it over his head before he dropped to the floor and began gasping for air. 

Once he caught his breath, Lobodzinski said: ‘I was really exhausted, almost dying. I was on the ground maybe five minutes, lying to feel better.

‘The race is really long. I was really exhausted, really tired, but also really happy because I win. Last year I was second.’

Lobodzinski finished with a time of 10 minutes and 1.4 seconds, nine seconds ahead of Germany’s Thomas Dold, who was last year’s champion.

The top female runner was Suzy Walsham of Australia, who had the top time of 11 minutes and 50 seconds.

The event, sanctioned by the International Skyrunning Federation, is part of the 2014 Vertical World Circuit, which includes a race at New York’s Empire State Building.
