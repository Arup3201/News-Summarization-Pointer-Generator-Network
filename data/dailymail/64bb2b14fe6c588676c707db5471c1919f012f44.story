A competitive eater has become the first person to eat one of the world's largest breakfasts by finishing a giant fry-up in just 21 minutes.

Emma Dalton, 25, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, took on the Wonder Cafe Challenge on ITV's This Morning show and successfully ate  four slices of toast, four eggs, six sausages, six rashers of bacon, six hash browns, four pieces of black pudding, plum tomatoes, beans and mushrooms.

In doing so, she became the first person to beat the Uxbridge cafe's breakfast dish challenge - a renowned competition that is considered to be one of the world's largest fried breakfasts.

She told ITV's This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden that she started eating competitively about 13 weeks ago when she 'smashed' a food challenge in Orlando.

She claimed she had always been able to eat a lot, but admitted to starting to now put on weight after taking on food challenges once a week.

Diners are given 45 minutes in which to complete the mammoth meal, but Ms Dalton finished in less than half the allocated time, putting down her fork after just 21 minutes - and around 5,000 calories.

Anyone who can complete the challenge gets their meal for free, but those who fail have to fork out the £20 cost of the breakfast.

And for those who still might feel peckish, the cafe also offers the Wonder Burger Challenge, consisting of a 36oz of 100 % Aberdeen Angus beef, topped with salad, onion rings, cheese and bacon, plus a side order of coleslaw and chips which must be consumed within 30 minutes.

In recent weeks, telephone accounts manager Ms Dalton has managed to munch her way through a three-pound cake and burger in Orlando, Florida, a huge 48oz burger complete with eight rashers of bacon and eight slices of cheese in Southampton, and an eight pound burrito wrapped in 10 tortillas in Walsall, as well as an 80 oz steak and three-foot-long hotdog.

The time in which she completed the challenge - 21 minutes - even surprised presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden. The cafe challenge stipulates diners must finish it within 45 minutes

'I went to Orlando about 13 weeks ago and I just went from there,' she told the ITV show.

'I did one and smashed it.'

Ms Dalton said she had found she was putting on weight since starting competitive eating, but put this down to the amount she eats other than the challenges which she undertakes once a week.

'I don't feel ill, but you do get the meat sweats you really do, it's a real thing,' she said.

'In the middle of the night you can't sleep, because of the quantity of the food you lie there and you feel hyperactive.'

Incredibly, after completing the breakfast Ms Dalton managed to find room for some chocolate.

'It's so savoury, you need something sweet,' she said.
