President Obama is set to back sweeping FBI proposals to overhaul surveillance laws making it easier for them to wiretap people communicating via the internet rather than by traditional phone services.

Since 2010 the FBI has pushed for a legal mandate requiring companies like Facebook and Google to build into their instant-messaging and other such systems a capacity to comply with wiretap orders.

To date the proposal has failed to get passed with technology companies raising objections that tougher laws would block Silicon Valley innovation.

FBI director Robert Mueller III has argued that the bureau’s ability to carry out court-approved eavesdropping on suspects is ‘going dark’ because it hasn’t been able to kept up with the fast evolving world of communications technology, reports the New York Times.

The agency believes tougher laws are necessary to help it combat threats to U.S. security such as last month's bombing of the Boston Marathon.

The White House is currently reviewing a revised version of the FBI’s proposal which focuses on fining companies that do not comply with wiretap orders.

Lawyers for the technology sector are warning that the laws will make communications less secure and more open to hackers and that technology innovators may go abroad because of too stringent laws.

According to the FBI, the proposal is aimed only at preserving law enforcement officials’ longstanding ability to investigate suspected criminals, spies and terrorists subject to a court’s permission.

The new proposal would enable judges to fine communications providers - $25,000 a day - who fail to comply with FBI request for access to user's information.

Currently, such orders instruct recipients to provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies, leaving wiggle room for companies to say they tried but could not make the technology work.

Foreign-based communications services that do business in the United States would be subject to the same procedures, and would be required to have a point of contact on domestic soil who could be served with a wiretap order, officials said.
