When it comes to budget supermarkets, it seems there’s no such thing as peace and goodwill at Christmas.

Aldi has opened up a new front in the festive price war by launching its own version of the iPad costing just £79.

Tesco has enjoyed huge success with its low-priced Hudl tablet, which launched in September.

Lifetab: Aldi has opened up a new front in the festive price war by launching its own version of the iPad costing just £79

But at £119 it is now far more expensive than the Lifetab, which goes on sale tomorrow in Aldi stores.

Experts said that while the quality of budget options might not compare with Apple’s original tablet computer, the affordability factor would lead to a rush of new sales.

Tony Cripps, of technology analysts Ovum, said: ‘It is a real threat to anyone in the tablet market.’

When it launched Tesco’s Hudl was the cheapest tablet on the market and sold incredibly well, with supermarkets shifting 35,000 models in  the first 48 hours, and it has sold  out twice since.

Argos also tried to grab a share of the market, launching its £100 MyTablet in October. It has now almost sold out.

Aldi’s Lifetab E7316, created with electronics firm Medion, may be cheaper but it has just 8GB of storage – half that of Tesco’s tablet – and offers just four hours of battery life compared to 9.5 hours on the Hudl.

At the high end of the market, Apple has recently launched its latest tablet, the iPad Air, which has a starting price of £399 rising to £739.

Treeva Fenwick, of Tesco, said: ‘The Hudl is the fastest selling tablet we have sold at Tesco and we are working with our suppliers to get more in to meet demand.’

Tony Baines, of Aldi, said: ‘We have positioned our Christmas offering this year to cater for every member of the immediate family with a fantastic gift at a manageable price, without compromising on quality.’

The number of parents reading books to their children at bedtime is in rapid decline, according to a survey. Some 70 per cent of 2,000 parents questioned now use tablets, computers or iPhone apps instead.

But parents said technology was helping to revive the tradition, and more than half felt that it made bedtime reading more stimulating.

iPad rival? Experts said that while the quality of budget options might not compare with Apple's original tablet computer, the affordability factor would lead to a rush of new sales
