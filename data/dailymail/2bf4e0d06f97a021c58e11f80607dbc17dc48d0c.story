A terrorism expert believes Australia should engage with returning jihadists, instead of locking them up and punishing them.

Steve Killelea, executive chairman of the Institute for Economics and Peace, believes fear tactics are not working and instead they should use returning jihadists as motivational speakers for vulnerable Australian Muslims.

'This idea of using fear and punishment only ends up alienating people,' he told The Age.

Attorney General George Brandis believes that jihadists that have returned to Australia pose a threat to the country and community and supports boosting police powers to arrest and detain them on return.

But Mr Killelea says using returned fighters could benefit Australia to discourage other would-be jihadists to join conflicts in Syria and Iraq, like the 90 odd Australians who have already done so.

In other countries similar theories are being put to the test. 

In the UK, former extremist members have established support and outreach programs to steer people away from extremism, while in Norway foreign fighters are not charged on their return.

Community leader Jamal Rifi told The Age, he was shocked punishment was being used on returned fighters.

But Attorney General George Brandis believes that the more than 20 jihadists that have returned to Australia pose a threat to the country and community, with police powers boosted to arrest them on return

Australia is ranked 95 out of 162 of countries most prone to terrorism but it was the sixth biggest supplier of western fighters in Syria

'The failure of us as a community and society to use their experience is like someone putting a straight jacket on what we can do for these young people,' he said.

Ahmet Keskin, executive director of the Affinity Intercultural Foundation, agrees and believes prevention is key, saying that returned fighters best understand the psychology behind Islamic State, who are recruiting vulnerable young people to fight.

According to the Global Terrorism Index, the number of terrorist attacks around the world has increased dramatically, with over 80 per cent of all terrorism occurring in only five countries.
