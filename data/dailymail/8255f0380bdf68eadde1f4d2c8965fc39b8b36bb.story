If you are already planning a ghoulish and original Halloween outfit, look no further.

The day of the dead may be three months away, but one designer has created a seriously creepy outfit for the spooky night's festivities.

Online e-tailer Etsy.com are offering fancy dress fanatics Zombie tights, and they're scarily realistic.

Ghoulish style: These Zombie tights are for sale on e-tailer Etsy and come in 'pink' or 'flesh' colour

Describing the £23.76 Zombie Doll ball tights, the site says: 'Be the best dressed Zombie at the party with the truly disgusting gangrene, bruised and bleeding tights with stitched up wounds.'

The seller adds: 'Tell me your size and I will make a pair just for you! Each one is a little different.'

Available in 'flesh', 'pink' or 'white' colours, the tights will certainly give Frankenstein a run for his money.

This isn't the first pair of crazy tights on offer on Etsy.

URB clothing 
jumped on board the trend for statement legs creating outlandish punky 'paint drip'
hosiery in January.

Most
of their dripping paint designs are made by decorating classic low 
denier black tights and one pair will set you back around £30 (plus £5 
to ship to the UK).

Their designs take a twist on the gothic
look with intentional laddering, holes and contrast between high and 
low deniers, as well as a gunge-like dripping liquid.

Their website warns that while the Black
on Black Melting tights are photographed holey, each product comes out 
slightly different and will arrive to you without holes.

The legwear is made with thin black 
or clear tights, latex and a thin layer of baby powder, creating the 
illusion that your legs are dripping with molten matter.
