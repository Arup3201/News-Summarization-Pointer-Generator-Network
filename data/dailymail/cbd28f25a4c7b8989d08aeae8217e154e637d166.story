Staying silent: The studio has no comment on this most recent leak

The studio had no comment on this most recent leak according to the Wall Street Journal.

This shortly after it was revealed that financial records had became public that detailed how much stars like Seth Rogen and James Franco were making, as well as studio heads Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal. 

The hackers also uploaded five yet-to-be-released films to file-sharing websites, including the Brad Pitt film Fury, still in theaters, and Annie, the much-anticipated remake set for a December 19 release. The company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease-and-desist orders.

Pay information for more than 31,000 employees at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, a financial firm hired by Sony, were taken in the hack as well. The pay information from 2005 revealed that there are far more men than women with high-paying salaries.

The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion.

Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by 'annual rate,' I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most.

'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.'

Buzzfeed reviewed almost 40GB of leaked internal data and reported it included 'employee criminal background checks, salary negotiations, and doctors' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence.'

It reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.'

The leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive.

One aspect of the leak, which probably has the Sony IT team reeling, is the several spreadsheet and text documents where employees stored their passwords...under the name 'password'. 

The hack is thought to be carried out by those allied with the North Korean regime, unhappy with the country's portrayal in the film.

In June, a North Korean official appeared on the state-run news station to say the country would pursue 'a strong and merciless countermeasure' if Sony released the film.

Despite the threat, Sony has continued to roll out promotion for the movie ahead of it's December 25 release date.

Exactly one month before it was set to be released, Sony confirmed that the company had been hacked, and that the mysterious group behind the cyber attack released hundreds of company documents online. The day before, an alleged warning posted to Reddit read: 'This is just the beginning'.

Responsible? Sources close to the internal investigation of the hack at Sony say they believe a North Korean group is behind the attack. Officials in North Korea previously threatened action

Sony has yet to officially name North Korea as the source of the cyber attack, but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out on Wednesday to say they believe a group known as DarkSeoul is to blame. 

The group associated with North Korea was thought to be behind the large-scale March 2013 attack on South Korean banks and broadcasters.

Other evidence from the hack points to the regime, including Korean-language coding, in similarities to other attacks by DarkSeoul.

The results of the internal investigation into the attack, currently being carried out by FireEye's Mandiant forensics unit, are expected to be announced later this week.

Earlier this week, a North Korean spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say 'wait and see' when asked if Pyongyang was involved.
