Victim: Barney McGinley, 63, was shot dead outside a church in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland

A man has been remanded in custody accused of shooting dead his uncle outside a gipsy family wedding.

Patrick McGinley, 46, is charged with the murder of Bernard McGinley close to St Mary’s Catholic Church moments before the wedding in Newtownbutler, a village in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, was due to start last week.

The 63-year-old grandfather was shot in the chest in front of his wife, Brigid.

The accused, who appeared in Omagh Magistrates’ Court yesterday, is the uncle of the bride who was just about to walk down the aisle.

Wearing a grey fleece over a blue checked shirt, balding and unshaven McGliney, from Lisfarrell in County Longford, Republic of Ireland, spoke only to confirm his name, address and that he understood the charge he faced during the short hearing.

A police officer told District Judge John Meehan that he could connect the accused to the crime.

Seamus Leonard, defending, said he wanted to make clear that his client voluntarily presented himself to police in Belfast earlier this week.

‘He provided a very full account of what happened in this tragic event,’ he said.

The solicitor said his client did not want to apply for bail at this stage but an application would probably be made in the future.

Judge Meehan remanded the accused to custody to appear before Enniskillen Magistrates' Court on March 16 via videolink.

Last Wednesday's ceremony for the marriage of Matilda McGinley, 17, and Jimmy O'Connor, 16, was delayed for a short period after the shooting but then went ahead. 

Father Michael King said the wedding party had asked him for the service to take place as planned.

He explained: ‘They said “father, we would like you to proceed with the wedding”, so I proceeded with the wedding. They spent at least half an hour inside the church at the end taking photographs.’

Mr McGinley was flown to hospital from Lisnaskea in a police helicopter but died later. 

Tributes were later paid to him. Cousin Willie McGinley said on Facebook: 'R.I.P. Uncle Barney. Gone but will never be forgotten. Still can't believe he's gone. God only takes the best.' 

And Michaela Dinnegan added: 'R.I.P Barney. May you get the best bed in heaven and look over all your family and help them get through this hard time.'
