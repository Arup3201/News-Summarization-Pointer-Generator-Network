Detective Chief Inspector Elizabeth Belton said an 18-year-old who was raped near a Leeds bus stop was 'left for dead' and found lying in a pool of blood

A teenage girl was 'left for dead' after being raped at a bus stop, police confirmed as they said they are hunting for a man who would likely have been left with blood on his hands or clothing after the violent attack.

The rape of an 18-year-old girl at a bus stop in Leeds in West Yorkshire is now being treated as attempted murder after the youngster suffered severe injuries and was left needing surgery.

Detective Chief Inspector Elizabeth Belton, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'We are now treating this as an attempted murder because she has been left there for dead.'

The officer has encouraged people to come forward with information about the attack and said this is 'no time for family loyalty.'  

The Asian teenager was grabbed from behind by a man,  in his 20s and also believed to be Asian, in the Beeston Hill area of Leeds. He dragged her into a garden and raped her just before 11pm on Friday night.

She was assaulted over a considerable period of time which left her with head injuries, a possible broken hip, and lying in blood.

DCI Belford added:  'It has been a very nasty attack that has been sustained over some time.

'The nature of her injuries are that she has suffered facial and head injuries and also a suspected broken hip.'

The suspect is described as an Asian man in his early 20s with a slim build and dark receding hair. Police said they believe he had been in the area for a while before the attack took place.

Police found the girl lying on the ground suffering head injuries but it later emerged she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. 

Officers said the road was very busy at the time of the attack and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward. 

DCI Belford said: 'I would encourage people to think – was there something out of place – or did someone come home with blood on their shirt?

A team of specialist forensic officers spent Saturday recovering evidence from where the girl was found

'This is no time for family loyalty – this was an horrific incident and the victim is lucky to be alive.'

Officers said they do not believe the attack was racially motivated and wanted to put an end to any speculation. They confirmed the victim was Asian.

'I think it is possible that someone will know [the attacker] as there was a considerable amount of blood that was at the scene,' said DCI Belford. 

'It's possible that the person responsible will have had blood on their hands and possibly blood on their clothing.'

Officers were looking for any hair or fibres that could help them identify the suspect who is in his 20s

The 18-year-old was attacked near Malvern Road and Beeston Road in Leeds at about 22:40pm on Friday.

Police are appealing for people to come forward - including a woman who is believed to have been standing at the bus stop shortly before the attack who then got on a number 1 or 47 bus. They also want to speak to a man who was jogging in the area. 

DCI Belton said the crime had 'shocked the community.' 

Anyone with any information are asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
