For more than a decade, John Maxse was the suave face of the biggest organisations in British horseracing.

But that face was looking rather less suave yesterday following an alleged attack by one of the Queen’s riders in what is believed to have been a fight over a woman.

In fact, Mr Maxse – former PR director at both the Jockey Club and the British Horseracing Authority, appeared to be sporting a black eye and a number of cuts and bruises.

The 45-year-old former jockey, who now works for the Qatari Royal Family, suffered ‘serious injuries’ and required hospital treatment for a suspected broken eye socket, broken collarbone and broken nose following the alleged attack in Newmarket last Sunday.

Jonathan Nolan, 32, who is a work rider for the Queen’s trainer Sir Michael Stoute, has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent.

Officers were called to an address in the Suffolk town – considered the global home of horseracing – at about 11.30pm following a call from a member of the public.

Mr Maxse, who splits his time between properties in London and Newmarket, later wrote on Twitter: ‘You know those times when you live through something potentially life changing but it’s just a bit too “big & heavy” for Twitter?’

He went on to joke about how he looked like film character Rocky Balboa.

Yesterday he added on the social media site: ‘Said my Sunday morning goodbye to Newmarket &, for a change, good riddance; on account of some of the toxic people who live there.’ When asked by the Mail if he believed the attack was because of him having an alleged relationship with Nolan’s girlfriend, Mr Maxse was keen to stress that the woman involved was Nolan’s ex-girlfriend. 

Mr Maxse, the former PR director at both the Jockey Club and the British Horseracing Authority, now works as a communications consultant for Qatar Racing, the horse investment firm owned by the Qatari Royal Family

He added: ‘There was no argument on the night, there was no fight.’ But he refused to comment further, saying it would ‘cause too much pain to other people’.

Mr Maxse is a prominent figure in horseracing and was the public face of the British Horseracing Authority and Jockey Club when he worked at both as PR director. He was the Jockey Club’s head of PR during the BBC Panorama programme’s damaging investigation into racing a decade ago.

He now works as a communications consultant for Qatar Racing, the horse investment firm owned by the Qatari Royal Family. He also rides out regularly for Newmarket trainer Michael Bell.

Nolan is a work rider at Sir Michael Stoute’s Freemason Lodge Stables in Newmarket. He used to ride the Queen’s horse Carlton House when it was trained there.

A work rider generally undertakes daily duties that include mucking out, exercising, grooming, feeding, watering, rugging up and bedding down horses. Earlier this year, Sir Michael trained the Queen’s horse Estimate to Gold Cup victory at Royal Ascot. It was the first time in the race’s 207-year history that it was won by a reigning monarch.

Nolan appeared in court in  Bury St Edmunds on Tuesday charged with grievous bodily harm with intent and was bailed to a later date.

Newmarket is dominated by horseracing and one in three jobs in the area is estimated to be related to the sport.

There are just 15,000 people but more than 3,000 racehorses in the town, which boasts two large racetracks – The Rowley Mile and The July Course.
