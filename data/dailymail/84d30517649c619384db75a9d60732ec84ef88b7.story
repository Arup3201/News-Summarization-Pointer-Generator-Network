The wife of GOD TV co-founder Rory Alec who quit the channel over a 'moral failure' says he left her for the divorcee daughter of a farmer in South Africa.

In a broadcast on the international television station British-born Wendy Alec said her husband of more than 20 years no longer wished to be part of the channel.

She told viewers that the 'devil got in very, very easily' and alleged that Mr Alec had been having an affair with a divorced woman.

Problems started in March this year when her husband returned from a visit to South Africa, she said in the broadcast.

'My whole world started turning upside down and the next morning he just went,' she said.

'It started to be extremely traumatic for me because suddenly my husband just started to change in a pattern and a way I had never seen him act before.'

Mrs Alec said she and the board of GOD TV asked Rory to go for counselling and claimed she discovered he had been having an affair in August.

'The devil got in very, very easily,' she said.

She added that the woman Mr Alec was having an affair with heard a voice from God telling her that he was her Mr Right and her husband.

Mrs Alec said: 'Rory is on this lady's father's farm in South Africa.

'He doesn't want to be involved in the ministry anymore and as far as he's concerned, the marriage is finished.

Rory Alec (right) had earlier said he would be stepping down from his role as boss of GOD TV due to a 'moral failure' in his marriage

'He doesn't want restoration, he doesn't want counselling, he doesn't want anything to do with it.

'He wants a new life.

'It is traumatic because it's like your life is over, all our memories.'

Last week Rory Alec said he was handing over the running of GOD TV to his wife. 

He said in a statement: 'After 20 years of service, I have had a moral failure this year.

'For this reason, I am stepping down. Please forgive me for the disappointment I've caused, but I know your eyes are on Jesus who is the author and finisher of your faith and not on me, an imperfect man.

'It is with a heavy heart that I confirm my season with GOD TV is over for now.'

God TV can be seen in more than 60 countries and is popular in the US, where it competes with other religious broadcasters. 

It claims to reach more than 900million people with its mixture of sermons and uplifting stories of people saved by faith. The Alecs feature regularly along with US-based evangelists.

Last year, they appeared in a show that attempted to exorcise ‘demons’ from President Obama to free him from ‘Jezebel’s clutches’.

The couple, who are in their 40s, met as singers on the cabaret circuit in South Africa.

Mrs Alec was born in London but grew up in Durban, South Africa, and became a devout Christian after seeing the face of Jesus in a mirror in the lavatory of a nightclub where she was singing.

The pair decided to set up a Christian TV channel in Europe after hearing a prophecy that they would do so.

They launched God TV with £140,000 in savings and it quickly became popular with US evangelists who paid to appear and gain access to European audiences. 

One of the first Christian broadcasters in Britain, God TV can be viewed online and on its Sky television channel

Rory Alec has not responded to the claims.
