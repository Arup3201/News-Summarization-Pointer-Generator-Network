A little boy who has survived nine life-saving operations has delighted his parents after coming home for the first time in his life.

Aaron Armstrong has spent the last 14 months in hospital after he was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder.

He suffers development problems including heart, facial and growth defects and has been treated at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle.

Aaron has finally gone home to the delight of his parents Elaine, 44 and Alan, 42, of Rowlands Gill in Gateshead.

Alan, who is serving in the Parachute Regiment, said: 'Elaine and I are over the moon to have Aaron home. It is great to be able to sit with Aaron and have time alone with him.

'We're beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. Aaron is doing well and is building up his strength.

'He has improved massively and is interacting. He reaches, grabs things and gently touches our faces. It's lovely and makes everything worthwhile.

'In the morning when he wakes up the first thing he does is smile at us.'

When Aaron was born, tests and scans revealed that he had a hole in his heart and was suffering cardiac problems.

Medics also diagnosed a rare chromosome 8.21 deletion syndrome and told his parents was likely to suffer learning difficulties and delays in his physical development.

Aaron had been receiving treatment at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital since May last year and has not been home until now.

The youngster is on a ventilator machine at home and is fed through a tube. He also has a tracheostomy which supports his airway.

It is not yet known how Aaron's condition will progress as he gets older and he is not yet saying any words.

'Aaron is behind on his progress as some children his age are starting to walk, whereas Aaron isn't and lies on his play mat,' explained Alan.

'But he's doing well and he is very determined. He is cute, with a great smile.

'I am immensely proud of him for getting through what he has.'

Aged six months, Aaron underwent eight-hour open heart surgery to replace a faulty valve. He has been fitted with a mechanical heart valve and a pacemaker to keep his organ working properly.

Aaron is monitored by community nurses and it is expected that he will have his tracheostomy reversed at a later date.

Parents Alan and Elaine, a practitioner nurse, are determined to help raise vital funds for the Freeman's Paediatric Intensive Care Unit to thank staff for the support they have given their only child.

In the spring Alan hopes to do a fundraising 69-mile run along the length of Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland.
