He was immortalised in the pages of The Beano following his Wimbledon triumph last year.

But as the champion gets ready to defend his title on the opening day of this year's tournament, Andy Murray has another big responsibility - to guest-edit this week's issue of the comic.

The Olympic gold medalist will appear in the Dennis the Menace and Gnasher strip in which he is coached in how to be a 'menace' and how to control his emotions ahead of an upcoming tennis tournament.

The special issue, on sale from Wednesday, also sees Dennis' dog Gnasher make a meal out of Murray's tennis racquet.

Murray, Britain's first Wimbledon champion since Fred Perry in 1936, begins the defence of his title at the All England Club on Monday when he faces Belgian David Goffin, who is ranked 104th in the world, on Centre Court.

The third seed is playing in only his second tournament since announcing Amelie Mauresmo as his permanent coach.

Writing in the editor's letter, Murray said: 'Olympic Gold was my proudest moment; becoming the first male British Wimbledon winner for 77 years was amazing, but this might be my greatest title yet... Andy Murray - Editor of The Beano.'

He added: 'it's not every day you get to guest-edit The Beano, but I used to love reading it when I was younger - it's amazing to think it's been running for 76 years.

'I'm around any time Dennis needs me to work on his tennis skills.'

In this week's issue Andy Murray will make a starring appearance and will learn how to control his emotions

The comic's editor Craig Graham said: 'It's amazing to think that Andy is the only British man to have won Wimbledon in the entire 76-year history of The Beano.

'Andy was a great sport throughout his week in charge, and he's welcome in The Beano office any time... although after his experience with Dennis I'm not sure he'll want to.'

The issue, which costs £2, also features a special supporter's poster for Murray fans.

The children's comic, first published by DC Thomson in July 1938, is still printed weekly and is best known for characters such as Dennis the Menace, Gnasher, The Bash Street Kids and Minnie the Minx.

Murray appeared in the 75th anniversary issue of the comic last year but this is the first time he has held the guest editor's role.
