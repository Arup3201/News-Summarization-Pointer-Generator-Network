This is the dramatic moment a ferocious lightning bolt crashed against the Grand Canyon as dusk fell over one of the world's greatest natural wonders.

The spectacular images captured the breath-taking landscape, which is thought to be 17million years old, being electrified into life as mother nature fired the fierce bolts towards the canyon walls.

Huge streaks of white light illuminated the surrounding skies as the thunderstorm's gloomy, grey clouds gathered in Nevada in front of the setting sun.

Using low exposure techniques, photographer Rolf Maeder managed to capture multiple strikes hitting the canyon under atmospheric skies for the photo titled 'Night of Lightning at Grand Canyon.

Mr Maeder specialises in taking photos of
wide-ranging landscapes. He told National Geographic Magazine: 'It was 
such a wonderful experience to witness this beautiful thunderstorm far 
across the Grand Canyon.'

In his blog, Photography Sedona, he wrote: 'The raw power of it thrilled me equally as much as the fragility and simplicity in a picture of a seagull flying with the ocean gusts.

'Scott Stulberg, Holly Kehrt and I decided to do a sunset trip to the Grand Canyon, a two hour drive from Sedona. The evening and sunset was very hazy. So we decided soon to return home, taking it slow and visiting some more viewpoints.

'And then, at the Moran Point, we could enjoy this incredible lightning storm emerging at the east end of the canyon.'

Backdrop: Rolf Maeder used low exposure techniques to capture multiple strikes, which are caused by humid conditions in late summer

According to the National Park Service, Grand Canyon National Park alone averages more than 26,000 lightning strikes per year.

The lightning strikes are a probable result of the late summer North American
Monsoon, where storms can be seen every day in a variety of locations across the area.

The monsoon delivers waves of moisture from the southeast, causing 
dramatic, localised thunderstorms fueled by high temperatures.

The other time the area receives showers is during winter when Pacific storms deliver widespread showers and snow at the highest points

The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide and is of over a mile. Nearly two billion years of the Earth's geological history has been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layers of rock while the Colorado Plateau was lifted.

Recent evidence suggests the Colorado River established its course through the canyon at least 17 million years ago. Since then, the Colorado River has continued to erode and form the canyon to its present-day configuration.
