If you thought ‘selfies’ were just for publicity-hungry celebrities and attention-seekers then think again. 

Customers at Lloyds will soon be able to set up an account or take out a credit card by sending a photo of themselves from their smartphone or tablet.

It must be accompanied by a photo of their passport or driving licence – but if Lloyds’ computer systems are satisfied that the ‘selfie’ and passport photo match up, they will be passed to an employee.

One, two, three... pout! Customers at Lloyds will soon be able to set up an account or take out a credit card by sending a selfie from their smartphone or tablet accompanied by a snap of their passport

Once double checked, customers will receive an email within 15 minutes to say if the application has been approved. 

Lloyds claims this will help hundreds of thousands of customers, as roughly one in three are currently asked to bring in identification documents when applying online to open a bank account or credit card.

These are typically new customers, foreigners who have just arrived in the UK, and young people - who may not be on the electoral roll, or have too little information stored on them by credit reference agencies to verify their ID.

The new electronic identification and verification checks will be introduced next week for existing customers wanting to set up a joint account.

The service will then be opened for all applications for current accounts, savings accounts and credit cards offered by Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland by the Summer.

But while it may make life easier for many customers, it comes as all the High Street lenders are closing hundreds of branches to slash costs.

No match for the human touch? While it may make life easier for many customers, the selfie service comes as all the High Street lenders are closing hundreds of branches to slash costs

Derek French, director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, said:

‘This is part of a general trend. Banks are pushing and pushing their customers to go online, but there is a large section of the population - particularly the elderly - that simply don’t want to, or don’t have access to this technology.’

If the photo matches that on the customer's passport they are approved
