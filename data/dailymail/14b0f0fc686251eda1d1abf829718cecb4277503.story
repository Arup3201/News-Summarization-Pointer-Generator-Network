An innocent bodega worker in the Bronx was accidentally shot dead by an NYPD officer as he tried to escape the store, which was being robbed by three armed men, police commissioner Raymond Kelly said today.

Reynaldo Cuevas, 20 ran at full tilt early this morning as he tried to escape Aneurys Deli & Grocery but in the mad scramble to escape, he ran into the officer.

The impact caused the gun to ‘accidentally discharge,’ Commissioner Kelly said, striking the man in his left shoulder.

Innocent: Reynaldo Cuevas, 20, a worker at his uncle's bodega, was shot dead by an NYPD officer as he tried to escape during an armed robbery, witnesses said

Helping hand: Cuevas worked at his uncle's bodega in the South Bronx

Dramatic moment: Security footage shown at a press conference this afternoon shows the moment Cuevas ran out of the bodega and into an NYPD officer

Alternate angle: Another camera angle shows the moment the bodega worker was shot; police commissioner Ray Kelly said it was an accidental discharge

The New York Post reported that one 
of the three gunman, Orlando Ramos, pistol-whipped the owner of Aneurys 
and then barked orders for him to get on the floor.

He was joined by accomplices Ernesto 
Delgado and Christopher Dorsey, who took to stealing cigarettes, lottery
tickets, and a little more than $700 from the cash register.

According to the Post, it was Ramos, 
31, who heard police sirens and told his partners to run for cover. 
Dorsey, 17, who was unarmed, was left in the front of the store.

Seeing their chance, the bodega owner
and Cuevo ran for their lives. Police surveillance video obtained by 
NY1 shows the owner running to safety, but apparently Cuevo running 
straight into the NYPD officer, who had his gun drawn.

Commissioner Kelly said in a press 
conference held this afternoon that the collision early Friday morning 
happened ‘within a matter of ‘split seconds.’

The head of the NYPD declined to name
the officer involved in the shooting, saying only that he has since 
been assigned to administrative duties.

He said in a message to the Cuevas family: ‘We want to extend our deepest condolences for their loss.’

But the apology was not accepted by 
Cuevas’ uncle, Alcibiades Cuevas, 52, who told DNAInfo in Spanish: ‘The 
police killed him. They thought he was a thief. They killed him like a 
dog.’

Cuevas’ cousin, Jose Garcia, told the New York Daily News that men raided the bodega early Friday morning. He said he witnessed the whole horrifying scene from across the street.

When Garcia got off of work around 2am, he was with a friend who wanted to buy cigarettes. As they were nearby, they went into the bodega where Garcia’s cousin worked.

'The 
police killed him. They thought he was a thief. They killed him like a 
dog.'

Garcia’s friend noticed the bodega owner was behind the safety glass at gunpoint on the floor. Dashing away, the man called 911, according to the New York Post.

When the friend fled, the two armed men barricaded themselves in the corner deli, taking the bodega workers hostage.

According to witnesses, the standoff between the two men and NYPD officers lasted for at least two and a half hours. At that point, the owner and his nephew, Cuevas, tried to escape the robbers and ran into the street.

Garcia said: ‘The owner opened the door and came out with his hands up. He said “They’re robbing me.”’ But he said that Cuevas didn’t have his hands visible and said nothing.

‘He just came out running,’ Garcia told the Daily News.

Extending condolences: Police Commissioner Ray Kelly apologised to the Cuevo family and showed reporters the surveillance video

Conflict: Crowds have been gathering outside the bodega debating the man's death and the effectiveness of the NYPD

Witness and Morrisania resident Jesse Rodriguez, told DNA Info that while running out, Cuevas ‘tripped by the fire hydrant.’ He continued: ‘And the cops shot him.’

Rodriguez said that while Cuevas was running out, frantic onlookers were yelling, ‘He works there! He’s an employee!’ He added: ‘He was innocent.’

Garcia told the New York Post that an NYPD officer shot his cousin in the neck. Cuevas was rushed to St Barnabas Hospital, but died from his injury.

The famous police operation has had several fatal shootings in the past few weeks, including a machete-weilding man in Times Square who refused to drop his weapon, and Empire State Building shooter Jeffery Johnson.

All nine people injured during the dramatic confrontation between police and the gunman outside the Empire State Building were wounded by gunfire from the two officers, police said.

Two of the bystanders hit by stray bullets may be looking to sue the city, it was reported.

Blocks away from the shooting, there was another chaotic scene, as an NYPD patrol car crashed, critically injuring two officers.

However, they are expected to recover from their injuries.

Morrisania is a neighbourhood within the South Bronx, an area notorious in recent decades for its unbridled crime, drug problems, and high drop-out rates.

Large parts of it burned in the 1970s, and since then, subsidized housing has been built to replace the buildings lost in the fires.

According to a DNAInfo report, crime has dropped some 73 per cent from 1993 to 2010, and has become one of the city's fastest growing neighbourhoods, with 27.1 per cent growth rate.
