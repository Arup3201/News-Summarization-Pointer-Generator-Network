Chris Robshaw returns to action on Saturday insisting his damaged shoulder will not be a problem.

The 28-year-old flanker has been sidelined for a month after almost dislocating his shoulder in Harlequins’ European Champions Cup clash with Leinster just a week after finishing England’s gruelling autumn campaign.

It was feared England’s captain would need surgery, therefore ruling him out of next month’s Six Nations.

Robshaw hurt his shoulder just a week after leading England to victory over Australia in November 

But intensive rehabilitation has seen Robshaw avoid going under the knife and enabled him to face Leicester in the Aviva Premiership this weekend.

‘There was some concern initially and I went to see a number of specialists to get their views on the right way to go,’ Robshaw told Sportsmail.

‘I hyper-extended the ligaments quite badly and they were stretched quite a long way. But we’ve gone through all the correct procedures and they should be fine for this weekend. The first couple of days after I suffered the injury were painful but fortunately it settled down quite quickly after that and that gave me a much more positive mind-set.

'The body is feeling good and I'm excited about getting back on the pitch. There's been a lot of long hours involved; lots of weights and lots of fitness. But there's only so much you can do in the gym and I'm raring to go.'

The injury forced Robshaw to cancel a planned holiday with his girlfriend Camilla over the New Year which would have seen him play in Quins' Twickenham clash with Northampton, which they lost 25-30, before taking a planned two-week mid-season break.

‘I managed to get two and half days off over Christmas when I was able to eat and drink more than I probably should. 

'I was able to relax and switch off which is incredibly important in what is going to be a momentous year for English rugby with the World Cup.’
