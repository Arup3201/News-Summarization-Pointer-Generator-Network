Britons using cash machines on their holidays paid more than £180 million in bank charges in the past 12 months, according to new research.

A survey of 2,353 British adults found that 61 per cent of those who went overseas last year took money out at a cash point that charged for the privilege. 

The average charge per ATM use, based on customer responses, was found to be a hefty £5.13.  

Britons spent more than £180,000 on overseas ATM fees in the past year, says VoucherCodesPro.co.uk

On average, the research says, the 57 per cent of those surveyed who went on holiday abroad used a cash machine twice during their break. 

This makes the total average spend simply to take out money was £10.26, according to money saving website VoucherCodesPro.co.uk.

By the researchers reckoning, 28,785,902 UK adults went on holiday in the past year making the total hit to the hip pockets of ATM abroad-using Brits added up to at least £180,159,446.  

When asked how they manage their money while away, 39 per cent of respondents said they took out a large sum of money, divided it and took out with them only what they needed for the day. 

The next most popular method was the carry all approach, with 31 per cent of travellers taking all their cash out with them and spending it as needed while 14 per cent used a pre-paid travel card.

Brits abroad use an ATM on average twice per trip away with their fees incurred adding up to £10.26 each

VoucherCodesPro.co.uk's founder and CEO Nick Swan said he was surprised by the findings. 

'This is a complete shock,' Swan said. 'Whilst the odd £5 bank charge here or there may not seem like a lot, the charges really can start to add up - particularly when you consider the collective charges for UK adult holidaymakers. Think about what else you could do with that £10, or what we as a country could do with over £180 million.

'It's understandable that there's going to be times when you run out of money or have to use your card for whatever reason, but you're being charged for taking your own money out of your own bank - it's silly. Some people don't like carrying lots of money around, or like to keep a reserve for emergencies, but that's what hotel room's safes are for.'
