Gerardo Martino has moved to quash fears over Angel di Maria's dip in form at Manchester United, claiming his explosive start to life in the Premier League was atypical for a foreign import.

Ahead of Argentina's star-studded friendly against Portugal at Old Trafford, the head coach was at pains to point out that Di Maria's performances during this season's infancy were at odds with what was expected.

The 26-year-old made a big-money move to United from Real Madrid over the summer and appears to have not been exempt to the suffering felt by Louis van Gaal's squad during a campaign to have started slower than David Moyes' ill-fated reign.

Assists: 5 

United can point towards an ever-expanding injury list as reason enough for lagging behind Chelsea at the top of the Premier League. 

Questions are, however, beginning to circulate as to why their £60million signing has not dragged the Reds through games - notably in the defeat against Manchester City and draw at West Brom.

Martino inferred that Di Maria has been a victim of his own early success.

'I have to say that Angel is one of the very top players in world football,' he said. 'His start was exceptional and the fact that generally when players go to a new club and have to get used to a new league, a new team, a different style of football and different team-mates, I think the form that he is showing now is possibly more typical of a player going to a new club than the very first few games when he burst onto the scene and did so well.'

Arguments rage as to how best Van Gaal utilises Di Maria, but Martino opted to turn that round; the former Barcelona boss believes the midfielder is capable of plugging any gaps needed in the north-west. There is a sense that trial and error may be the way for United to grow long-term. 

Di Maria scored three times in his first five Manchester United games, but his form has tailed off slightly

'With regards to his position, I would say that Angel is the type of player who can play a number of different roles expertly,' he added.

'You only have to look a few seasons back when he played on the right side for Real Madrid and in the season just gone, he featured more on the inside-left in a slighter freer role.

'Obviously, in the World Cup, he did very well when he played wide left so really, in terms of positioning, he can adapt to anywhere where the manager asks him to play.' 

Martino was full of praise for his players before the North-West showdown and claims Lionel Messi should win the Ballon d'Or as well as insisting Argentina's clash against Portugal is one worth watching.

The former Barcelona boss looks set to start Messi, despite playing a full 90 minutes at Upton Park last week, and characterises the friendly as important in gauging how far his side has to go ahead of next year's Copa America. 

'You can't take out that I am Argentine. I'm not the best person to judge because I can't separate sentiment. I'm not the most objective I would still vote for him [Messi.]

'Games like this are a good test for us in trying to lessen the amount of space. We are famous for our attacking style but we've got to try and balance out how we defend on a team.

'It's always a good feeling when you're playing in a stadium like this and each game has importance. It's all about constantly improving the squad. I've picked my team already.

'The idea is to look at as many as we possibly can but we need a base of players who are a nucleus. We hope to give some fresh faces a run out.

'These games and tours abroad are similar for all managers. We try to get on together and build a spirit but at the same time everyone is trying to win their place. Our short-term objective is the Copa America.

'Coaches can dress friendlies up to be more relevant than they are but we have the World Cup runner-up and a huge team in Europe so you don't need to dress this up.

'We've both got greater aims - Copa America and the Euros - but it is an important game and we'll be approaching it with the seriousness you'd expect.'
