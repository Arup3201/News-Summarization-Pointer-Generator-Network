A young woman who plunged 80ft from her hotel balcony and was left horrifically injured has said it's 'miraculous' that she's walking again.

Chantelle Serginson, of Middlesbrough, was told by medics that it could take 18 months for her to get back on her feet again after her terrifying fall.

But seven months on from her ordeal - which saw her suffer two brain haemorrhages, a broken jaw and multiple fractures to her legs - she is once again walking.

The 25-year-old said: 'Things are going brilliantly. I should not be sat here having this conversation.

'I should at least be paralysed or brain damaged but I have been miraculous.

'Doctors said it would take me around 18 months to walk again but it's taken me around four-and-a-half months.

'I can't overdo it and I am still on medication but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.'

Miss Serginson had operations to have metal poles and pins inserted into her legs and hips plus metal plates in her jaw following her fall while on holiday in Magaluf in May.

Now, after months of hydrotherapy and radiotherapy at Middlesbrough's James Cook University Hospital, Miss Serginson can now walk unaided.

She said: 'I have gone from a wheelchair to a walking frame to crutches.

'The first time my foot touched the floor I was sobbing. I can now walk to the shops but sometimes I need a piggyback back.'

She is now awaiting a further 
op to remove a metal pole from her left leg, and some time in the future
expects to have a knee replacement.

And although her injury means she 
will be unable to follow her dreams of becoming a dancer, she hopes to 
put her experiences to good use.

She said: 'I don't mind as I feel blessed to be here.

'I am looking into college courses. I want to become a support worker and do something for people who can't walk.

'I know what it's like as I have been through it myself and want to help.'

Miss Serginson says she has had a lot of 
support from mother Kim and boyfriend Marc Boden, 22, along with brother 
Brian and sister Jessica during her recovery.

And although she is on the 
mend, sadly Kim was diagnosed with bowel cancer in August and has had to
go through chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Chantelle said: 'I can't wait to see the back of 2012, it is not been our year. I am doing my bit to help her now.'
