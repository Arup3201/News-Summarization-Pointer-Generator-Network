As a fledgling actress in the 1960s, she had no shortage of attention from casting directors.

But despite going on to become one of the most respected stage actresses of her time, Dame Janet Suzman says it is now harder to find work – because people ‘lose interest’ in older women.

The 74-year-old accused the theatre world of ‘ignoring half the world’s population’ by not creating enough parts for experienced actresses.

She also said that feminism has ‘stalled’ and lamented that women are still judged on how they look.

Dame Janet made the comments yesterday during a break in her production of Solomon and Marion at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

The renowned Shakespearean actress, who was appointed DBE in 2011 for services to drama, plays Marion, a mother struggling to come to terms with the murder of her son in South Africa.

She said: ‘There are not eternally interesting parts for women with an interesting mind and view on life, gravitas. People aren’t interested in what women think.

‘If you’re peachy and young, the world’s your oyster. But as you get more interesting, they lose interest.

‘I started writing and directing as well as acting because there just wasn’t enough to keep me interested. It is ignoring half of the world’s population.’

Dame Janet also said she felt that feminism had not made the progress people thought it would in the 1970s.

She said it was ‘disappointingly not easier’ for women these days, because the ‘shift in attitudes has not happened’, adding: ‘It seems that women are not liked very much which I find very weird.

‘There’s been no movement at all in terms of judging women by their looks. Feminism has stalled.’

Born in South Africa, Dame Janet made her name at the Royal Shakespeare company in the 1960s.

She went on to have a distinguished career on stage and screen, including an Oscar-nominated performance in the 1971 film Nicholas and Alexandra, and appeared in many British television productions, including 1986 BBC drama The Singing Detective alongside Patrick Malahide.

She married director Trevor Nunn in 1969. The couple had one son, Joshua, now 32, but divorced in 1986.
