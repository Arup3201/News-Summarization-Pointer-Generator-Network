The damage wrought by a extremely powerful tornado that touched down in Illinois last year - as well as the steps toward recovery in the following twelve months - are unveiled in these remarkable photos.

The images were captured by photographers Fred Zwicky, Matt Dayhoff, Ron Johnson and David Zalaznik, who work for The Journal Star. They show the towns of Washington and Pekin, which are both located in Tazewell County.

They reveal stark changes, including newly-completed homes, as well as those still under construction, that were erected where residences were flattened and decimated last November.

Three people were killed by an EF4 tornado and over 1,100 homes were either completely ruined or were severely impacted, according to the newspaper.

Changes: Photos taken for The Journal Star show a ruined neighborhood in Washington, Illinois, in November 2013 and newly-built homes one year later at the same spot 

Natural disaster: A EF-4 tornado touched down in Washington last November, though signs of recovery are clear

Destroyed: Wreckage is observed at a Washington, Illinois Devonshire development 

Signs of life: The same development looks completely different twelve months on, with new homes and shrubbery 

Havoc: A  Devonshire development home was one of many left in tatters after the EF4 tornado

Shiny and new: The development home is completely made over just twelve months later 

The photographers' images show that many yards are still largely dust where grass once grew. The four photographers captured Washington both in the air and on the ground, as well as Pekin on the ground.

In regards to several before-and-after aerial shots over Washington, Illinois, Zwicky wrote 'These image pairs are only separated by time – in this case, about one year.

'Emotionally, time is expressed differently. It is heartache, hard work and togetherness.

'These images only show a view of brick and mortar, but each house contains a family that has their own story.'

Transformation: A man is seen at a ruined Pekin home in November 2013 (left). The next year, a new home is being erected at the same site

Shock: Deanna and Ray Baughman are seen in front of their ruined Pekin home with debris everywhere 

New look: The Baughmans, along with their daughter Nikki, are seen together this year 

Earlier this year, the photographers for The Journal Star also posted six-month photo comparisons.

Speaking to Fstoppers, Zalaznik said 'In the weeks and months following the tornado… I think we all began to encounter difficulty in comprehending specific locations. On the first day, you are standing surrounded by rubble in what had been a neighborhood of houses. You are disoriented.

'Then after weeks and months spent in rubble, houses begin to go up and the disorientation begins again because you had just learned how to find your way through the rubble.'

Dayhoff also told the website 'Some of the images were impossible to reproduce because of all the progress made in the ensuing year. In some cases, entire buildings were in the way.'

Dayhoff also stated 'Returning to the tornado scene a year later was the polar opposite of the day it hit. It was lighthearted and hopeful, as opposed to shocking and oppressive.' 

Comparison: Dozens of homes were decimated last November when the deadly tornado struck. New homes are seen one year later on the right 

Barren: One plot of land in Pekin was not redeveloped after its owner died six months after the tornado, according to The Journal Star 

Makeover: Chuck Phillips (seen left in November 2013) was able to stand outside with his dog just six months later. Phillips is seen outside on the right in a May 2014 snap 

Zwicky told Fstoppers 'One thing you always worry about as a photographer is the impact on your subjects when you show their grief and suffering. I photographed the emotionally devastated Baughman family shortly after their home was destroyed by the tornado. 

It wasn’t until a year later that I met them again. They warmly took me inside their newly rebuilt home, wanting to show me something. That something turned out to be the newspaper clipping of that horrible moment that I had shot, framed and sitting on their brand-new mantle.

'They thanked me for shooting the image and all of the tornado coverage that day. Deanna Baughman said, "That was part of our history… it let people know that what happened was important."'

Challenges: Photojournalist Matt Dayhoff has said 'Some of the images were impossible to reproduce because of all the progress made in the ensuing year. In some cases, entire buildings were in the way.' Changes on Prince George Court in Washington, Illinois, are seen here 

Sorting through: Residents are seen wearing masks while rummaging through the debris in Washington, Illinois

Turnaround: The same area looks extremely different in this May 2014 photo
