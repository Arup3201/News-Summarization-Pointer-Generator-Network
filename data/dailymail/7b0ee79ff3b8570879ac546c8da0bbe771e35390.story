Festival season kicks off this weekend but for music fans put off by the hefty ticket prices, this infographic shows they are better value than you think.

Showcasing the Top 5 value festivals, the VoucherCodes.co.uk list shows the savings you make if you go to a festival rather than purchasing tickets to see each act individually.

Featuring Justin Timberlake and The Killers, V Festival takes No.1 spot as the best value music festival in the UK with a massive saving of £242.61.

Glastonbury, last year’s top value event, has been bumped into second place, with a saving of £154.35 to see acts including Dolly Parton, Lana Del Rey and Metallica.

Scottish festival T In The Park, London's Lovebox and Reading/Leeds complete the Top.5 while this weekend's events, Isle of Wight and Download, rank at No.7 and No.9.

Anita Naik, lifestyle editor of VoucherCodes.co.uk comments: ‘Despite the fact many festivals are now charging over £200 for a weekend ticket, with many of the world’s biggest artists performing over the summer they still offer fantastic value for money.'
