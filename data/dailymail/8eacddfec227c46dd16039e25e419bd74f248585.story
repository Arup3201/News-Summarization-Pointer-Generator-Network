Qatar Airways is giving aviation enthusiasts an inside look at how its new fleet of super jumbo jets are being carefully crafted.

The first episode of a new web video series documents the assembly of the Airbus A380 – from an early-morning delivery of components to its inaugural test flight.

Taking aircraft size and comfort to new heights, the A380 can seat as many as 525 passengers in a typical three-class cabin layout and has a range of up to 8,500 nautical miles.

The time-lapse video celebrates this week’s delivery of Qatar Airways’ first A380, which was delayed following a spat with Airbus over the quality of cabin fittings.

The state-owned flag carrier of Qatar has ordered ten of the planes and they will be available on its Doha-London Heathrow route starting in October. 

In the video, the fuselage, wings, tail fin and hulking engines are assembled in a massive airport hangar in France.

Most of the components are delivered by flatbed lorries in the middle of the night, while the tail fin – sporting Qatar Airways' oryx logo – is flown in on Airbus’ Beluga super transporter.

The three-and-a-half minute video reveals the painstaking process as the components are positioned and set into place using machines and human hands.

It ends as the four-engine plane takes to the skies for the first time.

Qatar Airways’ A380 has been configured to seat 517 passengers on twin decks (eight in first class, 48 in business, and 461 in economy).
