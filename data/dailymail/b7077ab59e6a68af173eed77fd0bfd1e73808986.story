A 23-year-old woman who fell off a quad bike while celebrating her best friend's birthday in Florida has died from her injuries.

Jessica Oras was driving the vehicle around a lake on Sunday evening, with her friend and cousin Rachel Gernaat on the back, when she hit a rut in the ground.

Both women were thrown from the quad bike, but Miss Oras suffered serious injuries and died at the scene of the accident.

The friends had been celebrating Miss Gernaat's 19th birthday at a lake on private property in Brooksville, outside of Tampa.

At about 4.30pm Miss Oras told her friend and former roommate to hop on the back of the quad bike, then drove off round the lake.

'I just had a bad feeling,' Miss Gernaat told the Tampa Bay Times, as she recalled how her friend had said she was going to speed up just moments before the crash.

Other party-goers called for help but the young woman, who loved spending time with her friends and family, died from her injuries.

Police said Miss Oras and some of the other people at the party had been drinking beer and driving the vehicles, but it is not clear if alcohol played a part in the crash.

Miss Gernaat, who said Miss Oras was like a sister to her, said the 23-year-old 'put everyone at ease' and loved four-wheeling and going to the beach.

'I miss her. She's my best friend, and she's not there anymore,' the 19-year-old said.

Ty Lisco, who used to date Miss Oras,
 said she was sweet and cautious. He added that she had been on a quad 
bike more powerful than the ones she was used to.

Police spokeswoman Denise Moloney said the cousins had been at a private lakeside area popular with off-road enthusiasts.

From about 11am a group of friends had been drinking beer and using the four-wheelers, Moloney said, adding that Miss Oras did have alcohol.

Police have not said how much she had to drink, or whether alcohol had contributed to the crash.

A post-mortem examination is being carried out, and no criminal charges are expected to be brought.
