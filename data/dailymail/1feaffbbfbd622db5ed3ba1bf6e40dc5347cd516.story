Microsoft founder Bill Gates, ‘WikiLeaks whistleblower’ Bradley Manning and former U.S. President Bill Clinton are said to be among more than 230 nominees for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize.

Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and Russian human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina are also believed to be among the candidates.

Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is said to be on the list too. The secretive committee does not reveal who has been nominated, but those with nomination rights sometimes announce picks.

‘They are from all over the world, very many well-known names and some that are not so well-known to the public,’ the Norwegian Nobel Committee's non-voting secretary Geir Lundestad said.

Manning is the U.S. Army private charged with the biggest leak of classified information in American history. However, being nominated doesn't necessarily say anything about a candidate's chances.

A range of submissions come in every year from lawmakers, professors and others with nomination rights, but the decision rests solely with a five-member panel appointed by Norway's parliament.

The deadline for outside nominations was February 1, but the five-member committee added its own suggestions at a meeting last Friday.

Last year's prize was shared by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberian women's rights campaigner Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karman of Yemen.

Some critics say the committee has departed from award founder Alfred Nobel's intentions by broadening the scope of the prize to include efforts to promote the environment and human rights.

Favourite: Moncef Marzouki is a human rights activist who became Tunisian president in December

Earlier this month a Swedish authority that oversees foundations in Stockholm - including the Nobel Foundation - said it would investigate whether the peace committee is complying with Nobel's will.

The Nobel Peace Prize is one of five awards instituted by Alfred Nobel, right, the late Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite.

The prize is given to those who have ‘done 
the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the 
abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and 
promotion of peace congresses.’

First awarded in 1901, the peace prize
 consists of a medal, a personal diploma and cash award and is widely 
regarded to be the most prestigious award of its kind in the world.

Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, and a prominent voice in the Nobel guessing game, said his favourite for the 2012 award was Gene Sharp.

He is an American scholar and advocate of non-violence cited as an inspiration for the Arab Spring and other protests. Giving the prize to him would be a way for the committee to address criticism.

Mr Harpviken's other top picks were Ms Gannushkina and the Memorial human rights group, and Nigerian religious leaders John Onaiyekan and Mohamed Sa'ad Abubakar.

He said they have ‘spoken out against the misuse of religion in legitimating conflict’. Unfortunately for Mr Harpviken, none of his favourites have won the price since he started guessing in 2009.

‘It could well be that they look to Tunisia,’ veteran Nobel-watcher Jan Egeland, European director of Human Rights Watch, said. ‘It's the only shining success story of the Arab Spring so far.’

Mr Marzouki, a human rights activist who became Tunisian president in December, ‘would symbolise the whole peaceful transition from authoritarian repression to democracy,’ Mr Egeland said.

The wave of Arab Spring protests began in Tunisia and swept across Egypt, Libya, Yemen and most recently Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad has cracked down ferociously on his opponents.

The protests got a nod from the Nobel committee in 2011, when Yemeni protest leader Ms Karman shared the prize with Ms Sirleaf and Ms Gbowee.

Mr Egeland said the Arab freedom drive remained the world's most acute conflict and was far from exhausted as a Nobel theme.

‘There are still 34 or 35 armed conflicts in the world and I think they (the committee) have to get back to recognising heroes of conflict resolution or people working for the victims of war,’ he said.

‘There are many prizes for good deeds in the world, but only one price for peace of this size and format.’

The Nobel Prizes also include awards in medicine, physics, chemistry and literature.

A sixth award, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, was created by the Swedish central bank in 1968.

Each prize comes with a purse of 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.5 million) and the winners are usually announced in October. The winner receives the prize at a ceremony in December.
