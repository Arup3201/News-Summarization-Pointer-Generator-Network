Multi-millionaire: Fifty Shades of Grey author E L James's company posted revenue of £12million in its first six months of operation

Fifty Shades of Grey and its two 
sequels brought in more than £12million for its author’s company in just
 eight months last year, it emerged yesterday.

The erotic trilogy by EL James 
featuring explicit scenes of bondage became a  global publishing 
sensation and has sold more than 70million copies.

Now accounts for Fifty Shades Ltd 
reveal turnover of £12.6million in the period to the end of last 
September, with a profit of just over £8million after tax and costs.

The accounts also show the author has given more than £1million to charity.

Despite the success of the books, Ms James is still living in the same terraced house in West London - thought to be worth £350,000 - that she bought with her husband, Niall Leonard, 15 years ago.

The most extravagant purchase Ms James has made since her debut novel became a biggest bestseller in British history is a new Volkswagen car, the Sunday Times reported.

Ms James, whose real name is Erika Leonard, created the Fifty Shades company in February 2012 to handle the growing income from the books.  

She and her husband are the only directors of the company and paid themselves dividends of £355,000 on top of their £3,900 salaries, according to the first accounts filed at Companies House.

The couple also paid £1.1m in charitable donations to undisclosed recipients.

Ms James could not be reached for comment.

Some 70million copies of the Fifty 
Shades trilogy were sold between March and December last year, according
 to the publisher Random House.

Film deal: After becoming the biggest selling novel in British history 50 Shades of Grey is being turned into a film directed by the Turner Prize nominated director Sam Taylor Johnson

The success of the novels has also spawned numerous copy cat erotic novels.

The books are currently being turned into a feature film in a deal rumoured to be worth £3million to Ms James.

It was announced last week that the film would be directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, the Turner prize-nominated director 
whose work includes the John Lennon biopic, Nowhere Boy,

After the announcement that she would be directing the movie Ms Taylor-Johnson said: ‘I will honour the power of Erika's [EL James's] book and the characters of Christian [Grey] and Anastasia [Steele]. They are under my skin, too.'
