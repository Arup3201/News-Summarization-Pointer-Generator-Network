A Dutch teenager has been infected with an incredibly rare virus after attempting to rescue a drowning kitten.

The 17-year-old developed a blackened wound on her wrist after picking up the dying kitten from a ditch.

After numerous trips to different doctors, medics realised that the large, open wound was caused by the cowpox virus – a virus so rare that many doctors have never come across it.

A Dutch teenager has been infected with an incredibly rare virus - the cowpox virus - after attempting to rescue a drowning kitten. Cowpox is only found in Europe - mainly in the UK

The teenager developed a wound on her wrist shortly after coming into contact with the kitten which died shortly afterwards, Live Science reports.

It slowly blistered before turning black.

At the same time, she also developed uncomfortable red lumps which spread the whole way up and down her arm.

When the teenager first sought medical help, doctors assumed that the wound was infected with bacteria so prescribed her antibiotics but this did not help.

The patient, whose case was reported in the British Medical Journal Case Reports, then developed a fever so went to hospital.

‘When I saw the wound, I expected it to be a normal wound, so I was quite surprised when I saw the big ulcer,’ Dr Jojanneke Heidema, a specialist in pediatric infectious disease at St Antonius Ziekenhuis Hospital in Nieuwegein, Netherlands, told Live Science.

‘It did not look like a normal bacterial infection, so I went looking for other causes of a necrotic ulcer [a wound with dead tissue].’

The teenager’s doctors started to suspect that the problem could be caused by the cowpox virus so they contacted a virologist who was able to test for the virus.

Cowpox is a skin disease caused by the cowpox virus.

It manifests itself in the form of red blisters which are transmitted from infected animals to humans.

It is similar to, but more mild than, smallpox and it was the basis for the first smallpox vaccines.

Humans usually only become infected after contact with an infected cat or rodent.

The disease tends to remain localised and is self-limiting.

However, in patients with a suppressed immune system, it can be fatal.

It is only found in Europe - mainly in the UK - and infection is very rare.

Infections are most commonly seen in the autumn and are usually from domestic cats.

These tests revealed that the cowpox virus was indeed responsible.

Cowpox is a self-limiting disease so the teenager did not require treatment.

She started to get better a week after her diagnosis and the ulcer healed completely within two months.

However, she has been left with a scar.

Doctors believe that she contracted the disease, which is extremely rare, because she had a cut her wrist before she picked up the kitten.

However, it is also possible to be infected with the virus without having a cut.

She also had painful, red lumps over her whole arm

Doctors thought it was a bacterial infection but antibiotics did not work

Eventually, tests at a specialist lab revealed it was caused by cowpox virus

It can be infectious so a wound must be covered to prevent transmission

The wound cleared up within two months but she was left with a large scar
