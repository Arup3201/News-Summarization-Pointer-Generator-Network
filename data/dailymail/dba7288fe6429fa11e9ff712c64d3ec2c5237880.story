The friend of a tradie who chased an alleged car thief down the street has gone viral after doing a hilariously evasive interview with TV journalists.

A 23-year-old tradesman from Preston in Melbourne woke up about 4am to the sound of two men allegedly using a grinder to cut his 4WD and $30,000 worth of building equipment from a tree so they could steal it.

One man drove off in his car, so the builder chased him in his partner's RAV4 before both men got out of their vehicles and a brawl broke out, Nine News reported.

The friend of a tradie who chased an alleged car thief down the street has gone viral after a hilarious interview

The man was evasive when asked about his mate, saying his name was 'Tony Montana' from Scarface

The tradesman could face a police summons, while the alleged thief was taken to hospital and placed under police guard with injuries to his lower leg.

Media waiting outside his home stopped the man's friend to question him, but found he was less than willing to help.

When asked for the tradesman's name, the man replied: 'His name's Tony… Montana.'

Another journalist remarked that Tony Montana was the name of Al Pacino's character in Scarface.

'Yeah you watched it? Good movie,' he said, laughing.

Later in the interview a reported asked the man if he got his 'gear' back, in a reference to his tools.

'His gear? Yeah he got his pipe back, got his bong,' the friend replied cheekily before correcting himself.

Senior Constable Christian Tomming condemned the man for pursuing the alleged thief

'Oh yes, yes his equipment - he sure did.'

A clip of the man's interview, which was played on Channel Ten's The Project, was posted to Facebook and described as 'the best interview in Australia ever'.

It has received more than 1.5 million views in 14 hours.

The 23-year-old was questioned at Preston Police Station for several hours before being released without charge but police warn he could still face a summons as the investigation is ongoing.

Senior Constable Christian Tomming condemned the man for pursuing the alleged thief.

'I can understand his reasons and his motives but it's a highly risky decision and activity to try and go out into the darkness and confront unknown people,' he said.

The 33-year-old alleged thief, from Reservoir, has yet to be interviewed by police.
