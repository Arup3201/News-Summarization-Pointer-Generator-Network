These pictures show the dramatic scenes as an undercover NYPD cop was allegedly taken out by one of Justin Bieber's own bodyguards.

The undercover policeman was mistaken for a crazed fan trying to attack the teenage superstar in a bizarre melee that resulted in one of Bieber's own security guards being issued with a summons.

The pint-sized singer was at an event at Macy's department store in New York when the cop was allegedly grabbed by a bodyguard as screaming teenage girls surged towards the 17-year-old.

Crowds: A melee ensued when Justin Bieber came outside to greet fans during a publicity event in New York

Taken out: Bieber was at an event at Macy's department store in New York when an undercover cop was allegedly grabbed by one of his bodyguards as screaming teenage girls surged towards the 17-year-old

The plain-clothed officer stepped in to 
protect the Canadian heartthrob from the crowd surge when an 
overprotective Bieber bodyguard allegedly grabbed him and tried to pull him away 
from the boy.

Bieber was reportedly shaken up by 
the incident, which saw the bodyguard issued a summons for disorderly 
conduct.

Initial reports from the scene had 
suggested that a man had jumped the barricades, attacking Bieber and 
knocking him to the ground - but police have since denied that he was 
touched or hurt.

‘It was a momentary well-intentioned 
misunderstanding and the event went well,’ a spokesman for Bieber told 
the New York Post. ‘He’s completely fine and has no injuries.’

A witness said the 17-year-old 
Canadian singer shouted: 'What? What?' as the incident happened, before 
rushing back into the store and not talking to waiting reporters.

Shaken up: Justin Bieber was greeting fans at a promotional event to launch his new fragrance Someday

Supporters: Dozens of fans had camped out in front of the famous store for two days to get the opportunity to meet their idol

Dozens of fans had camped out in 
front of the famous store for two days to get the opportunity to meet 
their idol, who was doing a personal appearance to launch his new 
fragrance Someday.

Another witness told the New York 
Daily News that people who had been waiting for hours got too excited 
and began pushing the barrier down, meaning he did not even get time to 
wave at his fans.

Bieber tweeted this evening: ‘today 
went well at macy's.. the fans were AMAZING, thanks to all the fans who 
came out to support it was a breath of fresh air :)’

He had appeared on The View on 
Thursday morning and tweeted before his Macy’s appearance: 'Gonna 
chill..grab a bit..then see everyone at MACY's for the #SOMEDAY launch. 
LEGGO!!'

Bieber's fans, known as 'Beliebers', 
rallied to support the singer after the incident, on the initial 
understanding that somebody had tried to attack him.

One young lady was so overcome by the incident that she had to be carried away by police officers.

Bieber has had other security scares 
including at an event in 2009 at the Roosevelt Field Mall that was 
cancelled after thousands of fans mobbed the shopping centre.

He tweeted to his followers to leave the mall because police threatened to arrest out of control fans.
