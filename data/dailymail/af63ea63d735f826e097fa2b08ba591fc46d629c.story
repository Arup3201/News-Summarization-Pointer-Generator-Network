German international Sami Khedira admits it will be hard to leave Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of the season.

The central midfielder, 27, has not agreed a new deal with the club and has been linked with a return to the Bundesliga, with Bayern Munich and Schalke possible destinations.

A switch to the Premier League has also been mooted but Khedira says he will fight for the club until the day he leaves, which he will do with a heavy heart.

'I love Real Madrid, it will be hard to leave this club,' Khedira said according to Marca.

'I will give everything for this shirt until the last day of my contract, there should be no doubt about that.'

Khedira has come in for heavy criticism this season and has lost his place in midfield to Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, while young Brazilian Lucas Silva was signed in January.

The former Stuttgart man hasn't featured since the disappointing Champions League defeat by Schalke, when he was the subject of abuse from fans after the game.
