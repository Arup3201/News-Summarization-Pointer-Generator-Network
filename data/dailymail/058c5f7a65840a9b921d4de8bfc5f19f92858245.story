At one time those with a penchant for chocolate and sweets could safely be categorised as being on the lardy side of the health barometer.

However, manufacturers are tapping in to our love for treats to push foods that could actually improve health.

Harvey Nichols is reporting remarkable sales for the chocolate brand Ohso, which delivers large amounts of ‘friendly’ bacteria to the gut to improve health and digestion.

While a web food store is offering a new high protein sweet which claims to help build rippling muscles rather than flab.

Healthy treat: Ohso chocolate bars, which delivers large amounts of ‘friendly’ bacteria to the gut to improve health and digestion, are rapidly increasing in popularity

Ohso sells its chocolate bars in multiple packs and actively encourages consumers to eat one every day of the week, just as they might an apple or some healthy green veg.

Each one contains over one billion live Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria and is said to be three times more effective in delivering it to the gut than the popular yoghurt and milk alternatives.

The firm claims that, like the popular probiotic yoghurt and milk products, these bacteria help to positively influence healthy gastrointestinal functions and the immune system.

More than this, the bars, which contain 63 calories, are being sold on the basis that they have many other health benefits.

The spokesman said: ‘Cocoa flavanols, the specific group of polyphenols which are abundantly present in the cocoa bean, have been shown to possess several beneficial effects and play an important role in supporting our health and well-being.

‘They are natural and powerful antioxidants and help to strengthen your body’s own natural defence against free radicals when under oxidative stress. Furthermore, cocoa flavanols have shown protective effects on several health parameters, such as cardiovascular health, cognitive function and skin quality.’

Good for you chocolate: Each one contains over one billion 'good' bacteria and is said to be three times more effective in delivering it to the gut than the popular yoghurt and milk alternatives

Cocoa and chocolate also contain a unique form saturated fat which, according to recent research, has a neutral effect on the production of bad cholesterol and could possibly promote the creation of good cholesterol.

The bars also contain many B-complex vitamins, needed for releasing energy and creating the body’s building blocks, as well vitamins D and E.

The idea of eating chocolate being a positive health choice has been fuelled by the fact that British Olympian and gold medal winning medallist, Laura Trott, has become a brand ambassador for what she calls her ‘guilt free’ treat.

At last: Eating the chocolate can be considered 'guilt free' because of its health benefits

Co-founder of the company, Andrew Marten, said: ‘There’s always been this perception that if it’s good for you it doesn’t taste good. But we’re the absolutely opposite. This tastes great and fits into a healthy lifestyle.

‘The friendly bacteria help to positively influence healthy gastrointestinal functions and your immune system, digestion and overall health and wellbeing.’

He added: ‘Consumers are becoming increasingly educated and mindful about what they are eating. Now they can enjoy a daily chocolate treat like that is clinically proven to be three times more effective at delivering good bacteria than functional probiotic yoghurt or milk drinks.’

Mr Marten certainly seems to be on to a financial winner after being given the Investec Food & Drink Entrepreneur of the Year Award at the House of Commons last year.

Marion Carpentier, Group Food and Hospitality Director at Harvey Nichols said: ‘Sugar free brands such as Ohso are proving highly popular and have bolstered sales in the category by over 30 per cent compared with last year.’

While the bars initially were sold exclusively by the upmarket store, they are now available across the high street in places like Boots or Tesco at £3.99 for a pack of seven.

The website MuscleFood.com is also tapping into the trend for healthy treats by launching a pack of 10 chewy sweets which contain a total of 15g of protein, 10g of fibre. Each sweet is a relatively modest 15 calories.

The main ingredient is whey protein, which is used by sportsmen, while there is no sugar or gluten.

Spokesman Darren Beale said: ‘Keeping fit and leading a healthy lifestyle doesn’t mean you have to eat boring food and lots of salad.

‘We began trialling the products after customers told us they missed things like sweets and would often crave a treat after a workout. These sweets taste the same as any other chewy sweet you would buy, but contain very few calories and lots of protein.’
