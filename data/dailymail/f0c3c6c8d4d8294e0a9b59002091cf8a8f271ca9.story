South Africa’s Vernon Philander has been fined 75 per cent of his match fee for 'changing the condition of the ball' during the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle.

Philander was charged following the end of Friday’s third day after the match umpires viewed television images which showed the 29-year-old scratching the surface of the ball with his fingers and thumb.

Philander, the leading Test all-rounder in the world rankings, accepted the penalty without contest.

An ICC statement read: 'Philander was charged with an article 2.2.9 offence of the ICC Code of Conduct which relates to ‘changing the condition of the ball in breach of Law 42.3 of the Laws of Cricket’.

'The charge was laid following the conclusion of Friday’s play and after viewing television footage by on-field umpires Billy Bowden and Richard Kettleborough, third umpire Nigel Llong, all from the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, fourth umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge as well as match referee Jeff Crowe.

'The incident that led to the charge being laid took place in the afternoon when Philander was captured on footage changing the condition of the ball by scratching the surface with his fingers and thumb. The footage, which was not aired during live coverage, was viewed by the umpires after the close of play.'
