French president Francois Hollande visited his estranged first lady Valerie Trierweiler over the weekend to discuss her future, an aide has claimed.

Miss Trierweiler left hospital in Paris on Saturday after reportedly overdosing on sleeping pills, and is now ‘resting’ at the president’s country house in Versailles.

The source claimed that the pair arranged a meeting to have ‘words’ on the weekend, before Mr Hollande was due to leave on an official trip abroad today - La Lanterne.

Francois Hollande, an avowed left winger who ‘dislikes the rich’, was set to visit his estranged first lady Valerie Trierweile to ‘discuss their future’ in one of the most opulent homes in Europe

Sources at Paris Match – where 
Trierweiler has worked for more than two decades – say the president 
feels he needs more time before choosing between her and his lover Julie
 Gayet, 41.

However one 
of Mr Hollande’s aides confirmed yesterday that his relationship with 
48-year-old Miss Trierweiler was ‘over’ – and she will be asked to move 
out of the presidential homes, including the Elysee.

Mr
 Hollande is expected to publicise a decision about Miss Trierweiler’s 
future before he leaves for a scheduled visit to the USA in February.

Meanwhile
 Miss Trierweiler made her first direct public comment about the scandal
 on Saturday, tweeting: ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all 
those who have sent messages of support wishing me a speedy recovery. 
Very touched.’

While 
Miss Trierweiler has indicated she is prepared to forgive and forget 
following revelations of his affair with an actress, her furious uncle 
Florent Massonneau said: ‘I think the fact my niece is being cuckolded 
is disgraceful. Her situation gives us a lot of pain.’

It came as a new poll revealed that 77 per cent of  French people are ‘dissatisfied’ with Hollande’s presidency. 

Today such figures were expected to rise, as the growing crisis was set to be played out in La Lanterne.

Built for the bodyguard of the pre-Revolutionary monarch Louis XVI, it has long been viewed by the left as a symbol of unacceptable wealth and privilege.

Despite having her own flat in Paris, Ms Trierweiler, 48, was driven to the the magnificent presidential home on Saturday afternoon after spending eight days in private hospital room suffering from stress. 

It was caused by hearing about Mr Hollande’s secret two year affair with the film and TV actress Julie Gayet, 41.

As Ms Gayet remained in hiding, a  source close to the president confirmed that he ‘planned to see’

Ms Trierweiler today, and that he and the first lady would be ‘discussing their future’. 

Mr Hollande only saw Ms Trierweiler once in hospital, and even then only after she had been at the Pitie-Salpetriere for more than a week.

Ms Trierweiler is desperately trying to hang on to her role, despite clear indications that Mr Hollande wants to make Ms Gayet his first lady.

In an attempt to drum up public support, Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter on Saturday night to write: ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all those who sent messages of support ... very touched’.

Her words were met with an avalanche of ridicule, with people describing her as everything from ‘the Rottweiler’ to the new Marie-Antoinette, after the high-living wife of Louis XVI who was eventually guillotined.

A new Ifop/idd poll in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reveals 37 per cent of France is ‘very discontented’ with Hollande’s presidency, and 40 per cent are simply ‘discontented’.

Mr Hollande visited his political heartland of Correze, in central France, on Saturday, but again refused to answer questions about who his real first lady was.

Instead Bernard Combes, the Socialist mayor of Combes – a job Mr Hollande had for seven years – said: ‘France's political situation requires all of the president's attention and all of his time, so obviously it would be best for everyone if he can resolve the problems in his personal life under good conditions.’
