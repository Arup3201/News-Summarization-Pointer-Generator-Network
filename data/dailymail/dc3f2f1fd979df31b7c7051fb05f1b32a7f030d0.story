One of the teenagers who was captured on video as she violently beat up a fellow classmate at a Brooklyn McDonald's claims she and her friends had been planning the attack for months.

Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested ten times, told authorities that she and her friends were planning to go after the 15-year-old victim because she had 'done something to a very close friend.'

Ferguson was seen laughing and smiling as police led her to a car in handcuffs on Thursday.

This as two more girls who were involved in the fight have been apprehended, including one 15-year-old who was taken off a plane in Atlanta as she attempted to flee the country for Jamaica.

Three of the girls involved still remain at large.

The two girls apprehended today include a 15-year-old girl was accompanied by her mother as she turned herself in, and the aforementioned 15-year-old who was trying to get out of the country.

The New York Daily News reports that authorities had been alerted to her travel plans.

As for Ferguson, her most recent arrest came last month when she stabbed her brother in the arm, and last year she was arrested after she punched her grandmother in the face and a month later when she injured an officer while resisting arrest. 

Despite this, her lawyer, Sarah O’Leary, is pleading for leniency now that she is being held on $500,000 bail, saying; 'She was making some efforts to better things in her life.'

Ferguson, who belongs to the Young Savages gang, could be looking at 25 years in prison.

The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her and has been getting support from thousands on social media. 

The 15-year-old wrote on Wednesday; 'Everyone Like I'm Famous Now.'

On Thursday, Ferguson detailed the reason for the fight with police, saying it had been in the works since January, and that it all began when she got a call from a male friend letting her know that the victim was at McDonald's.

She then left her friend's house and waited for her other friends outside the fast food chain, and once they arrived the group 'put the beats on her.'

After the beating was done, Ferguson said she was 'still mad,' and that is why she began kicking the victim's head as she lay motionless on the ground.

She then took her purse, make-up bag and phone and claims she threw them in the trash as she walked out.

The victim, who also has links to a gang according to the New York Daily News, continues to not cooperate with police.

'That type of behavior is not acceptable in our society,' said NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said.

'Certainly is not going to be acceptable here in New York.'

The 16-year-old in the fight (left) who was stripped to her bra has been arrested, while the girl being picked on is so weak at the end that she collapses on a bench

The graphic cell phone footage emerged earlier this week of the brutal attack  that took place after class on Monday afternoon.

The three minute clip showed an unfair fight that began with the victim  being set upon by six other students.

As the girl is mercilessly pummelled by the gang her blonde hair extensions are ripped from her head as she is repeatedly punched and kicked.

The vicious fight is cheered on by dozens of other youths who jockey for a good view of the senseless violence.

The video, posted on Facebook, captures the afternoon brawl at a McDonald’s  near Erasmus Hall High School on Flatbush Avenue.

Despite being outnumbered, the small girl gives as good as she gets and at one point she pulls a black hoodie off one of her attackers to reveal a bra.

Towards the end of the video - which has been shared more than 19,000 times and viewed more than 740,000 - the smaller girl is left cowering under a table.

Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off.

Bystanders can be heard saying, 'She’s dead,' and, 'You murdered her.'

A few students then intervene, pick the small girl up and sit her on a nearby bench. Immediately she collapses and so the students help her to lie down.

'The message has to be sent very clearly, that this kind of violence will not be tolerated whether in a mall or in restaurants and those involved should turn themselves in to authorities immediately so as to face the consequences of their violent actions,' said Brooklyn community activist Tony Herbert.

Anyone with information about the fight is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS.
