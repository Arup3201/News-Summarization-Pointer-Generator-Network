Police say a 14-year-old Colorado girl was fatally shot by her stepfather after a report of a burglary at her home.

Colorado Springs police spokesman Larry Herbert said the girl's 
stepfather fired the shot, but said it was unclear if he had mistaken 
the teen for a burglar.

Herbert said the girl was entering the home at the time that she was shot.

This is the 4300 block of Ascendant drive in Colorado Springs where a 14 year old girl was fatally injured by her stepfather

Police say the girl was shot around 6 a.m. Monday in the northeastern residential area of Colorado Springs. She was rushed to the hospital and later died of her wounds.

Authorities did not specify the girl's injuries but she was in critical condition when she arrived at the hospital.

CW 2 reports that the case was expected 
to be handed down to the district attorney's office after the police 
complete their investigation. The district attorneys office will decide 
what charges to file against the girl's stepfather.

The stepfather hasn't been arrested and it will be up to prosecutors 
to decide whether charges should be filed. Colorado's 'Make My Day' law 
allows residents to defend themselves against intruders.

According to highcaliberdefense.com, The 'Make My Day' law permits homeowners to fire at intruders only if they are certain the intruder will commit a crime other than trespassing. They are permitted to fire if the intruder plans to use physical force, no matter how slight.

Westword reports that the law was first enforced in 1985 after homeowner and medical marijuana grower Al Michaud of Colorado springs used his Smith & Wesson gun to successfully ward off intruders.

'Make My Day' is in reference to Clint Eastwood's famous line he says as a cop in Dirty Harry. It is part of what police refer to as the 'castle doctrine' stemming from the old English common law, 'a mans home is his castle,'says wisegeek.com.

The Mail Online spoke with police spokesperson Larry Herbert who said the case is still currently under investigation and that he cannot share any new information.
