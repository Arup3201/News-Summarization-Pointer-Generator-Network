Tough: Top state schools are having to choose between up to 18 pupils for each place (picture posed by model)

Recession-hit parents are scrambling for a 'Rolls-Royce' state education for their children -  meaning up to 18 pupils are now fighting for one place at the most popular schools, it has been revealed today.

Top grammar schools, faith schools and academies are being flooded with applications as many mothers and fathers are struggling to afford private school fees.

The most-sought after institutions must choose up to 200 pupils out of more than 1,000 applications a year and are developing more complex admission rules to prevent parents 'playing the system'.

England's most over-subscribed state school is the Muslim secondary Al-Hijrah in Birmingham, where 18 students compete for every of its 60 places.

It is followed by Herschel Grammar in Slough, which has 14 applicants per place, while across the Berkshire town sits Langley Grammar, which must deal with 13 per place.

Experts say these high numbers are driven by people being priced out of private school so targeting stop state institutions instead.

'There are some brilliant supercomps out there, often led by superheads and getting super results,' Janette Wallis, senior editor of the Good Schools Guide told the Daily Telegraph.

'In most cases, however, these highest achieving comprehensives have some element of selection, whether it be geography, church attendance or a percentage admitted on the basis of aptitude.'

Currently parents applying for schools for their children can approach between three and six, which all headteachers must treat equally regardless of whether their school is the first choice.

Expensive: Experts say years of recession means that fewer parents can afford private fees so target top state schools instead

However, there are rules preventing parents 'buying' their way into schools by purchasing homes in the catchment areas.

Instead many schools hold a lottery, where pupils are chosen by ballot or tests are held and a mix of lower, average and higher ability children are chosen proportionately.

A quarter of schools use at least one of these systems.

The Government says they are creating more school places.

'We are creating thousands more school places and raising standards throughout the country so that every child has the chance to go to a good local school,' a Department for Education spokesperson said.

'We have made £2.7 billion available since 2011 for those local authorities that face the greatest pressure on places and this month we announced an extra £1 billion to build new free schools and academies and expand existing good schools.'
