The former girlfriend of software mogul John McAfee, who has evaded authorities in Belize since they named him a 'person of interest' in his neighbour's murder, has revealed he is living 'in constant fear'.

The woman, who would only identify herself as 'Francesca', spoke out as police dug up the remains of McAfee's four dogs, who were found poisoned days before his neighbour, American businessman Gregory Faull, was found shot in the head.

McAfee is believed to have shot the dogs to put them out of their misery and police are now investigating whether the same type of bullets killed the animals and Mr Faull.

Francesca said she has spoken regularly with McAfee, 67, since he disappeared a week ago.

On the run: Antivirus mogul John McAfee, seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor, claims he is being set up by the Belize government and lives in 'constant fear'

'He's in constant fear, paranoid,' she told CNN. 'I would say it's because 
of what he has been through. He thinks people are always after him, 
which they really are right now.'

She added that she does not know where he is, but that he is not at home, as he had claimed this weekend.

'It will never be ended until John is dead,' she said. 'That's what I believe, until they kill him.'

Her claims come as McAfee apparently began writing a blog, entitled The Hinterland: The Official Blog of John McAfee about being on the run after his 'harassment' by the Belize government.

'I am asking all people of conscience to read this blog, and see the ugly truth unfolding here,' he wrote.

On the blog he also claims that he 
has dyed his beard and hair almost white and darkened his skin with shoe
polish in an effort to stay ahead of authorities.

'I stuffed my cheeks with chewed bubble gum stuck to the outside of my upper and lower molars – making my face appear much fatter,' he added. 'I darkened and browned my front teeth.

'I stuffed a shaved down tampon deep into my right nostril and died the tip dark brown – giving my nose an awkward, lopsided, disgusting appearance.'

He added that he has changed his clothes, walks with a limp and speaks with a heavy Spanish accent.

So convincing is his appearance, he wrote, that 'while peddling small wooden carvings, I nearly sold a dolphin carving to an Associated Press reporter standing at the edge of my dock'.

Despite his fears, police say they have not named McAfee a suspect and simply want him to come in for questioning, with someone else in tow if he would prefer.

'My goodness,' Raphael Martinez, a police spokesman, said in response to McAfee's fear. 'He needs to come in so that we
can clear the air. We are law-abiding people here. We follow the laws 
to the letter. We believe at this point that he has absolutely no fear 
of being killed by anybody.'

Faull, 52, was killed earlier this month
in his home near San Pedro, on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye, 
and McAfee has not been seen since.

Three other people have been held for questioning in the murder and police continue to investigate other leads, authorities said. 

Officers have searched McAfee's home and dug up the remains of four of McAfee's 11 dogs, who were fatally poisoned before the murder of Faull.

It is believed the neighbour had complained about the dogs' barking, but McAfee has denied a role in Mr Faull's murder.

'He did not like my dogs,' McAfee said in an interview over the weekend. 'He was
a minor annoyance. All neighbours can be minor annoyances from time to 
time but without them the world would be empty. I know he didn't kill my
dogs.'

Witnesses told CNN that police only left with the dogs' heads for ballistics testing.

Despite evading police for days, McAfee has claimed that he is in his home in Belize.

'I am where I am most of the time,' he told CNBC on Friday. 'I am certainly inside my compound.'

As soon as the news reached Belize police they were on their way, spokesman Martinez said, adding that McAfee has several buildings on his compound and that any one of them could have hidden safe house.

The revelation of his location seemed somewhat out of character for a man who's said he's terrified of being executed by Belize police. Yet his behavior has been increasingly erratic in recent days.

Speaking briefly to a British newspaper, The Daily Telegraph,
McAfee, 67, denied all knowledge of the murder of Faull and claimed he 
is being set up by the prime minister of the country, Dean Barrow.

When asked what he thought would happen to him if he turned himself in, McAfee said: 'I think I will be summarily executed.'

'I know the prime minister laughs at this. He's a clever and charismatic person.

'The
constitution has been ridden away with. They can make up some excuse 
for removing me. This is the way it is in this country.'

McAfee added that he is now accompanied by a woman and will never surrender to the authorities.

'I wish I had a TV, that would be 
very informative. I'm keeping tabs through friends. I have intermittent 
access to the internet, again through friends,' said McAfee.

'They
nationalised the phone company and so they can trace calls and 
triangulate. I cannot talk on this phone for long. My plan is a 
day-to-day plan, simply to avoid detection.'

Indeed,
on Thursday night, McAfee took to the Internet under his 'stuffmonger' 
alias and asked for advice on how to avoid being caught because of his 
phone being tracked.

'How long does it take for a phone company to triangulate a cell phone signal?' said McAfee.

'With
what accuracy? Is there any way to confuse/delay the system? If a cell 
phone is turned off, but the battery is installed, is there any way to 
locate the phone?

'Are there any brands of phones are more/less difficult to triangulate?'

McAfee
denied he had anything to do with his neighbours murder, saying, 'I was
at home. I heard nothing. I knew nothing until the following day.'

The founder and creator of the McAfee
anti-virus software business said that in addition to hiding, he was 
employing the use of a disguise to evade capture.

However, he added, 'To say what your disguise is would be foolish.'

McAfee's home on Ambergris Caye, an 
island off Belize was raided by Belize's Gang Supression Unit in April, 
amid reports that he was arming himself and running a meth lab.

'The GSU sent people looking for a meth lab that did not exist and I never received an apology,' said McAfee.

'My
experience of this government has not been positive. The GSU is the 
right hand of the prime minister. It's supposed to report to the police 
but everyone knows it doesn't.

'There was no meth lab, what on Earth would I be doing running a meth lab?'

Earlier this week the prime minister of Belize called the antivirus pioneer 'bonkers' as he remained on the run while cops investigate the murder of his neighbor.

Prime Minister Dean Barrow said McAfee was only wanted for questioning and should report to authorities.

Barrow also expressed doubts about 
McAfee's mental state, saying: 'I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I
believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers.'

McAfee told The Associated Press by 
telephone that he didn't kill Faull, though he acknowledged he had 
differences with the dead man.

'I
barely knew him, I barely spoke ten words to him in the last three 
years,' McAfee said, speaking on a cellphone. 'Certainly he was not my 
favorite person and I was not his.'

'He
was a heavy drinker and an annoyance. But the world is full of 
annoyances; if we killed all of our annoyances, there would be nobody 
left,' McAfee said.

Other 
expat residents of the island of Ambergris Caye, where San Pedro is 
located, have described Faull, the owner of a construction business in 
Orlando, Florida, as peaceful and well-liked.

McAfee, the creator of the McAfee 
antivirus program, has led a life of eccentricity since he sold his 
stake in the anti-virus software company that is named for him in the 
early 1990s and moved to Belize about three years ago to lower his 
taxes.

McAfee told the Associated Press via 
email in May that ‘the government wants me out of the way. Too many 
people have died in custody in this country so I intend to do nothing 
that puts me in their custody.’
