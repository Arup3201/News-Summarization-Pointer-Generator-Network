Thousands of commuters who travel to work outside of peak hours will be given discounts on season tickets, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has revealed.

The cheap rail fares will also be available for people who work part-time as the government plans to cut the cost of regular rail travel by bringing in 'smart ticketing'.

Mr McLoughlin admitted that improvements needed to be made for passengers, but said the electronic ticketing scheme would save passengers money.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured on a train to Leeds with David Cameron, said he wanted to cut rail fares for people travelling outside of peak hours by bringing in 'smart ticketing'

'I'm not going to sit here complacently and say everything is fine for the passenger,' the Transport Secretary told the Independent.

'I think there is a lot that still has to be done for the commuter. I am very well aware of the burden of fares.'

Ticket prices have continued to rise - up by an average of 4.2 per cent in the last year - and only four in 10 people believe train companies give value for money.

Mr McLoughlin plans to bring in electronic 'smart ticketing', similar to the Oyster card scheme in London, which he says will reduce fares. 

He said: 'Not all commuters want to use the train five days a week. But at the moment it works out cheaper to pay for a season ticket than buying three return journeys a week. 

'We have not got the kind of smart ticketing that would make the difference to enable you to purchase six journeys a week rather than pay for 10 journeys a week.'

A similar initiative by C2C, a rail operator in the east of England, was introduced this week and could be rolled out across the country.

The Cabinet minister added that he wanted to make off-peak services cheaper than rush-hour trains, which could alleviate the crush thousands of commuters experience on packed trains.

He said: 'We all know that commuter trains are horrendous between 8am and 9am. Now can we get to the situation where somebody gets on their train at 10am is charged a different rate? With smart technology there are a lot more opportunities.'

A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators and Network Rail, said they were looking into the possibility of smart ticketing.

'We are already exploring new forms of ticketing such as smart cards and mobile ticketing that have the potential to reduce journey times, offer more flexible fares and drive down costs.'
