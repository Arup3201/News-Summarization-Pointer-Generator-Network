Six-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Amy Van Dyken Rouen has severed her spine following a serious all terrain vehicle accident in Arizona at the weekend, her family have confirmed.

The 41-year-old champion was airlifted to the intensive care unit at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn Medical Center following the crash in Show Low on Friday night.

She told emergency workers at the scene she could not move her toes or feel anything touching her legs, according to the Associated Press.

A letter released by the retired athlete's family said she severed her spinal cord and that her broken vertebrae came within millimeters of rupturing her aorta.
