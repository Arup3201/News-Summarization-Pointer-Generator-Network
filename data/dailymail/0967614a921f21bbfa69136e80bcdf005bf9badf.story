Will Lionel Messi win the World Cup Golden Boot?

The Beautiful Game moved into the scenic splendour of Rio de Janeiro, the path to its spiritual home at the  great Maracana paved with the irony of an invasion force of some 25,000 Argentinians marching there via the swirling pavements of the Copacabana.

This World Cup is now the party nobody wants to miss.

From the dark forebodings of socio-political strife a football phoenix has arisen, in all its multi-coloured plumage.

Perfect 10: Lionel Messi stands and celebrates his goal in Argentina's win over Bosnia and Herzegovina

Lighting up the world: Messi celebrates his goal

Goals 
galore. Upsets  of wonderment. The most opening matches without any kind
 of  draw  – let alone a bore – since before the war. Even the first 
high-technology goal award.

Thus the challenge of keeping the Brazilian faith fell to this country’s most envious of sporting neighbours.

To
 break the spell would be criminal. For Argentina to do so in this part 
of the world where the game is a religion would be sacrilege.

Those
 hybrids of Bosnia-Herzegovina were also asked to play their part – and 
did so to increasingly heightened Argentine tension -  but the weight of
 expectation was on all the blue-and-white striped shoulders, not only 
 those hunched in the household name of Lionel Messi.

Master at work: Messi watches his shot hit the post and go into the goal

Argentina, two-time winners, are a World Cup power with a coven of stars and that stature brings with it responsibilities.

Brazil,
 Holland, Italy, England even in defeat, France in the teeth of cynical
  intimidation from Honduras, had already met that standard. They had 
 started football back down the road to what it always should be – the 
opiate of the masses no matter how down-trodden they may be.

Here, if only for a few short weeks, is escapism from the poverty and inequality of the favelas.Never mind the quantifying of the cost, feed on the spectacle.

The
 first game here came as an important staging post in this project. 
This, 28 days later, is  where it will all come to a climax. Hopefully 
glorious.

Belief: There were 25,000 Argentina fans in the Maracana to watch their side win

Argentina
 are among those with the most serious aspirations of making that return
 date. Part of that desire is rooted in the rivalry with Brazil which is
 among the most passionate in the football world.

Nothing could be sweeter for Messi and his men to meet and beat the host nation in that final.

But
 first they had to deal with these  eight-syllable Europeans and 
although  they had so many of their countrymen here encouraging them 
 that proved challenging in the extreme. 

A
 mixture of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s readiness to take the fight to them and
 tell-tale signs of that familiar Argentine arrogance answered the call 
to provide more thrills and spills – but did nothing to suggest that we 
were in the presence of potential world champions.

So overwhelming was Argentina’s occupation of Brazil’s famous stadium that we might have been in Buenos Aires.

At
 the start the men from the Balkans seemed awestruck  by the huge 
atmosphere and Kolasiinac, still a teenager until next week’s birthday, 
presented Argentina with that Father’s Day  gift of a third minute own 
goal. 

Strangely,
 though, that mishap settled the Bosnians to their now uphill task. 
Argentina, meanwhile, were slack and unco-ordinated in possession and 
distracted at the back.

The under-dogs – less star-power, superior organisation – frequently gave the second favourites kittens.

Great expectations: Argentinian football fans watch their side win

Messi,
 for whom this is supposed to be his optimum World Cup, was as nervous 
as any of them, In brutal truth he was  having something close to a 
nightmare for more than an hour. Then he found the magic with a typical 
jinking run and classic low shot in off a post and all was forgiven.  
Well, for the moment at least.

There
 are yet sterner tests awaiting in the knock-out phases but the fits 
induced by the Bosnians will nag at the Messi men as they move on. And 
although he is a more stable and humble personage than Diego Maradona, 
some of that Hand of God arrogance still runs as undercurrent through 
Argentina’s psyche.

They
 were complacent after the early present, even though they were often in
 all sorts of trouble. Then the ego which had been in danger of 
crash-landing took flight again as soon as Messi put them two up.

The late Bosnian goal which brought on more panic for the final five minutes should be a lesson but do they never learn?

Messi
 ‘s solo had saved the three points, as well as sparing the tournament 
its first draw going into its fifth day. But it will take more than this
 if Argentina are going to win their third World Cup – and if he is ever
 to ranked up there in the pantheon of all-time greats with Pele, di 
Stefano, Garrincha --- and, of course, Maradona.

Still it has to be acknowledged that they honoured the spirit of what is now undeniably the greatest show on earth.

Even
 though a second goal against them would have wrought havoc with their 
campaign they spurned all thought of playing keep-ball in the dying 
minutes, going all-out and reckless for a third of their own.

No don’t stop the carnival.
