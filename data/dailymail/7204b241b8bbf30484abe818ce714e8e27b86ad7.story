It was revealed today that the doctor who stabbed her seven-year-old daughter 31 times before killing herself had a major confrontation with her relatives in the weeks preceding her suicide.

Victoria Vovchik, 45, told a friend that her relatives were 'all dead to me now' after a massive falling out.

Vovchik was discovered lying dead in the master bedroom of her New City, New York home when the father of her daughter came to pick the girl up.

The daughter, Ava Sangavaram, was found lying nearby but in spite of her significant injuries, she was 'alert and responsive' when emergency crews arrived on scene.

A number of details surrounding the life of Dr Vochik are mysteriously missing as investigators try to explain how she could have brought herself to harm her daughter and then kill herself.

It is unclear whether Dr Vovchik and her daughter's father, Dr Kristappa Sangavaram had ever married, but they were not together at the time of her death.

Dr Sangavaram was the one to call police on Thursday as he arrived at the home to pick up the girl. Dr Sangavaram, 68, did not live with Vovchik and their daughter, but co-owned the home.

Though she remains in critical condition, he seemed hopeful on Thursday night, telling Newsday: 'Be happy that she's going to be fine. Thank God she's alive. She's going to be OK.'

Dr Sangavaram was brought in for questioning by Clarkstown police, but was later released. They do not believe he played any role in the tragedy, the Journal News reported.

Police now think that the best understanding of the true version of events will come from the little girl as soon as she is strong enough to talk to investigators.

Police said Vovchik left behind no note explaining why she attacked her daughter or took her own life. She used a knife or other sharp object to kill herself, officers said.

'She loved Ava. Ava was her world. If she tried to kill Ava and herself, it was a misguided — probably frantic — attempt to spare them both future suffering,' her college friend Allison Solin told local paper The Journal News.

Ms Solin spoke to Dr Vovchik two weeks before her death and said that her friend was going through some family trouble, though she did not know the cause.

'She would call me crying and say, "Family is the most important thing to me, and I don’t feel like I have a family anymore." These are her exact words — ‘My heart bleeds for this little girl (Ava) because she doesn’t have a family,' she told the paper.

Vovchik went on to dramatically liken the split in her family to genocide.

That was not the only split going on in her life either, as she recently closed one of her three medical practices.

Vovchik was a podiatrist with practices in Fort Lee and Montvale, New Jersey, but the doctor who sold her the Fort Lee practice spoke to her about six months ago and was told that she was shuttering the location.

'I asked her if there was anything I could do to help. She said no, that she was fine. She wanted to join a group practice,' Dr Richard Weiner told Newsday.  

She co-owned the house in New City where she lived with her daughter and bought it with the girl's father in 2010 for $810,000.

The lawyer who represented them in the sale said that he thought that they were together as a couple, but Sangavaram's grown son from a different relationship refutes that theory.

'It’s a touchy situation because he had a child with her (Vovchik) but wasn't married to her,' Preeth Sangavaram, 29, told The Journal News.

'The child was very important to him, so he always tried to maintain a healthy relationship.'

The elder Mr Sangavaram had reportedly been married to a different woman for several decades, though the status of that relationship is also unclear.

Though Dr Sangavaram and Dr Vovchik apparently tried to be civil for the health of their daughter, her friend Ms Solin painted a picture of a turbulent relationship.

'A lot of times, when I would speak with her, they were in a fight and he was nowhere to be found. At times, he just wouldn’t take her calls or respond to her, and that would make her extremely anxious and desperate,' she said.
