Halloween has long been the biggest day of the year over on Today, with the morning show team always devoting much time and energy to their costumes, and this year was no different as the anchors got to show off their comedic chops as classic characters from the long running NBC variety show Saturday Night Live.

Even better, the costume department was able to just run upstairs at 30 Rock and grab the same costumes and wigs worn by many of the performers from the actual skits, which provided for some striking likenesses between the actors and anchors.

Scroll down for video 

The gang's all here: The anchors of Today show off their Halloween looks (left to right) Willie Geist and Tamron Hall (Spartan cheerleaders); Natalie Morales and Peter Alexander (Mary Katherine Gallagher and priest); Al Roker (Blues Brothers); Julia Sweeney and Matt Lauer (Pat); Jenna Bush Hager, Savannah Guthrie and Meredith Viera (Mom jeans); Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford (Wayne and Garth); Lester Holt (Blues Brothers)

The perfect cheer: Willie Geist and Tamron Hall (above) showed off their dance moves as The Spartans, the spirited duo first played by Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri

Kicking things off live from New York was actual SNL player Kenan Thompson, doing a cold open appropriate for morning viewers as he delivered the weather as Al Roker.

From there, the Saturday Night Live credits got reworked, introducing the Today team in a manner just like the SNL cast, as they hailed cabs, hopped on the subway, and, in the case of Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford, guzzled wine.

Then came the skits.

The newest kids on the block, Willie Geist and Tamron Hall, gave America Today's take on the very spirited Spartan cheerleaders, complete with a cheer and some carefully choreographed moves to the 90s dance classic that is C + C Music Factory's "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)."

Live from New York: The show even did their own version of the SNL title credits to kick things off

Superstar: Natalie Morales (above) got her Catholic school girl on as the very theatrical Mary Katherine Gallagher, a character made famous by Molly Shannon, with a little help from Peter Alexander as a priest

Diva's debut: Morales and Alexander did good work getting down the look and feel of Shannon's debut performance as Gallagher in 1995 with guest host Gabriel Byrne (above)

Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell they were not, but the two certainly had their moves down. And boy were they spirited.

Speaking of spirited, Natalie Morales proved to have endless energy as she bounded out after Willie and Tamron as the very theatrical and dramatic Mary Katherine Gallagher.

Joined by a dapper looking Peter Alexander, forced into the thankless role of playing the largely silent priest, Morales jumped, stretched and patted her pits just like Molly Shannon first did when she debuted the crazy Catholic school girl almost 20 years ago.

Wine's world: The Pinot loving ladies from the show's fourth house, Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb (above), proved to be pretty excellent drag kings, dressing up as Garth and Wayne, the basement dwelling rockers first played by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey

Double take: The ladies bore a striking resemblance to the original duo of Myers and carvey (above)

It's Pat: Matt Lauer (above) dressed up as the lovably androgynous Pat, and even got a visit from the lady who created the character, Julia Sweeney (above)

The morning show's resident sommeliers, Gifford and Kotb, stepped up to the plate next, and proved to be pretty impressive actors as they delivered a remarkably good performance as basement dwelling Queen aficionados Garth and Wayne from Wayne's World.

And in her torn jeans and black wig, Gifford almost looked identical to the original Wayne, Mike Myers.

Al Roker and Lester Holt followed the ladies, and while they didn't get to do much acting they did get to belt out a tune as they dressed up, and sang, like The Blues Brothers, the R&B duo created by Dan Akyrod and the late John Belushi.

Even better, Akyrod sent in a video giving the duo his blessing. 

Mom's here: Jenna Bush Hager, Savannah Guthrie and Meredith Viera (above) showed off their derrieres as the ladies from the Mom jeans commercial, originally played by funny ladies Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch and Maya Rudolph

The original: Rudolph, Dratch, Fey and Poehler in the original commercial (above), which aired in 2003 during the show's Mother's Day episode

Then, for what seemed to be the finale, Matt Lauer came out as Pat, the androgynous beauty first played by Julia Sweeney, who was also on hand to do a little skit with Lauer.

This marks a long running tradition of Lauer doing drag on Halloween, having previously dressed up as Pam Anderson, Jennifer Lopez and Paris Hilton. 

The show had one big surprise however, and ended on a very, very high note, when new moms Savannah Guthrie and Jenna Bush Hager pulled up at the end of the segment in a van and got out to reveal the final costumes of the day - the ladies from the Mom Jeans commercial.

Memories: Lauer, as Pat, dreamed of one of Lauer's former drag costumes, Lauer as Pam Anderson

Fiercesome foursome: Morales, Alexander, Geist and Hall kept things going for another hour on Today's Take

Surprise appearance: Dennis Haskins even showed up to reprise his Saved by the Bell role as Mr. Belding (above)

The commercial, which first premiered on SNL back in 2003 during the show's Mother's Day episode, was written by Tina Fey, and starred Fey, Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch and Maya Rudolph showing off a new style of jeans that features pleats and a 9-inch zipper.

An applique vest comes complimentary with each purchase. 

Hager and Guthrie, who were wearing the wigs from the original sketch, were joined by another mom too to round out their group - Meredith Vierra.

The three even filmed their own version of the commercial.

Everyone gets involved: Even the production team got in the Halloween spirit, dressing up as Conheads

Dancing in the street: Savannah really got into the spirit of her character, making her exit by exiting out of a minivan

Masterpiece theater: Lauer and Sweeney reenacted one of Pat's classic sketches

Following that reveal, there were more bits from the team, with Dennis Haskins showing up at one point in character as Mr. Belding from Saved by the Bell to host a mock talent show that featured Geist and Hall doing another bit and Morales falling into some boxes and  delivering one of Coach Taylor's famous Friday Night Lights monologues as Gallagher.

Haskins last appearance on the show came in 2013 on the same day his former Bell costar Tiffani Thiessen was also a guest, an appearance that became memorable after the two had a very awkward exchange on the air when Haskins asked to say hello to a visibly disinterested Thiessen. 

Darling derrieres: Hager, Guthrie and Viera took some time to show off the junk in their trunk

And there's more: Hager, Githrie and Vierra also filmed a commercial just like the original Mom Jeans ad

Social media response to this year's costumes was almost universally positive, with Twitter and Facebook users showing a particular affinity for the ladies looks as well as Mr. Geist's cheerleader.

And while not exactly panned, people had little to say about Roker and Holt's take on The Blue Brothers. 

Not weighing in yet, though sure to do so soon, are current and past members of Saturday Night Live.

Also staying quiet on social media were past Today anchors. 

Guess that's why they call it the blues: Lester Holt and Al Roker (above) sang and danced as The Blues Brothers

No shade: Holt and Roker had the classic Blues Brothers suit down (above)

While also paying tribute to their friends, the Today move to do SNL costumes may have also been an attempt to give some press to the struggling show on a day when the morning show, which is having its own problems with viewership, is guaranteed to have one of their biggest audiences of the year.

Now in its 40th season, SNL has been having some trouble bringing in viewers, with the show's recent episode featuring former cast member Bill Hader marking an all time ratings low for the program.  

The show will no doubt get some help this weekend however thanks to big name host Chris Rock and even bigger named musical guest Prince.

The anchors of Today did an impressive job portraying classic Saturday Night Live characters on their Halloween episode Friday

Highlights included Natalie Morales as Molly Shannon's Mary Katherine Gallagher and Willie Geist and Tamron Hall as the Spartan cheerleaders

@highlight

Matt Lauer dressed in drag, possibly, as the androgynous Pat, and was visited by Julia Sweeney, who originally played the character

Also impressive were Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford who played Wayne and Garth from Wayne's World, and looked just like the boys

@highlight

The best costumes came courtesy of Savannah Guthrie, Jenna Bush Hager and Meredith Viera, who were the moms from the Mom Jeans commercial

@highlight

The move by Today to remind viewers of SNL's former greatness may have well been a ploy to help the show as its ratings have sunk to record lows
