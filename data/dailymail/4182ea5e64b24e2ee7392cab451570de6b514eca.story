'Suicide': Izzy Dix, 14, who died after months of abuse at the hands of internet trolls on Ask.fm. Her mother has launched a petition to get the site shutdown

The mother of a teenage girl who was driven to suicide by internet trolls and school bullies has urged the public to help her close down controversial website Ask.fm.

Izzy Dix, 14, was found hanged at her home after suffering months of vile taunts, insults and cruel remarks

The schoolgirl wrote a heartbreaking poem about bullying months before she died in September.

Her family say she took her life after struggling to cope with the abuse - much of which came via Latvian-based Ask.fm.

Izzy’s mother Gabbi, of Brixham, Devon, has already got 11,000 signatures on her online petition calling on the government to outlaw the site.

Speaking at the start of Anti-Bullying Week, Gabbi urged more parents to sign up before another child succumbs to the 'relentless' pressure of bullying.

She said: 'Izzy was bullied at school and in the community over a period of about 18 months.

'She would be relieved to get home from school but then the abuse continued online. Bullying is relentless these days - there is no break from it.

'We closed down Izzy’s Ask.fm account but a piece of her had already been chipped away.'

Ask.fm, which has more than 70 million registered users worldwide, allows anyone to post anonymous questions and comments on to a person’s profile.

It has been heavily criticised for its lack of regulation and incidents of cyberbullying and been linked to the suicides of 12 young people around the world in just over a year.

Gabbi wants it to be closed down as part of a wave of policies designed to keep young people safe online.

Izzy's heartbreaking poem about bullying was published by her mother in the wake of her death in an attempt to help people understand the pain and suffering caused by bullying.

It was read out at the schoolgirl’s funeral where it reduced many mourners to tears.

Called I Give Up, it reads: ‘They begin to tell me that nobody wants me there. They tell me to leave and that I am not wanted.

‘I look down and walk, my eyes drowning in a sea of emotion. Another piece of me chiselled away by their cruel remarks and perceptions. I give up.’

Mrs Dix said she decided to publish it to help people understand the pain and suffering caused by bullying and abuse on social media sites.

Family friend Maddie Sinclair added: 'We are all devastated by what has happened and so utterly determined to help young people in Izzy’s memory.

Moving: Gabbi and Izzy embrace. Mrs Dix said that Ask.fm should be shutdown after it was linked to 12 deaths in the last year

'Research has shown that almost seven out of ten children in the UK have been bullied at some point. That figure is just horrific and we need to do something about it now.'

A study published Monday to mark the beginning of Anti-Bullying Week found that just one in 10 parents believe their children are safe online.

Police are not treating Izzy’s September 17 death as suspicious and an inquest will be held at a later date.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'Owners and operators of these sites must take more responsibility or risk facing users and advertisers boycotting them.

'The Prime Minister has set out a series of measures to both keep children safe online and to prevent access to images of child abuse and we have seen progress, as set out at yesterday’s summit.

'More generally, we have given almost £3million to Beatbullying, the Diana Award, Kidscape and the National Children's Bureau to provide state-of-the-art anti-cyberbullying materials for schools and we have introduced staying safe online into the new curriculum from the age of five.

'In the new year, industry will launch a major new national campaign that will speak directly to parents about how to keep their children safe online and how to talk to their children about dangers like sexting and online bullying.'

A spokesman for Ask.fm has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Gabbi’s petition to close down Ask.fm is online here.
