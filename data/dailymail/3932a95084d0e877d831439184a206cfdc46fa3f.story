Most patients are scared to complain about poor treatment because they fear that they will be ‘branded troublemakers’ by the NHS.

Some are even denied treatment after raising concerns, the new patients’ watchdog Healthwatch England has found, while others are labelled ‘serial complainers’.

Despite concerted efforts to make the NHS more open when things go wrong, Healthwatch has discovered that a pervasive ‘culture of fear’ means many patients are still petrified to make complaints.

Healthwatch chief executive Anna Bradley warned a total overhaul of NHS complaints procedure was needed

The watchdog, which is the official voice of the patient in the NHS and social care, will present a 50-page report to Parliament this week outlining its concerns and setting out a series of recommendations.

Last night, chief executive Anna Bradley warned a total overhaul of the NHS complaints procedure was needed, saying: ‘This is not just about tweaking with the system.

‘Patients experience fear in relation to making complaints and too often providers of health and social care are defensive and not listening properly. It a very negative experience for everyone.’

Miss Bradley said many hospitals, surgeries, mental health trusts and care home providers still denied patients information and forced them to pursue litigation when many did not want to.

As part of its research, the organisation conducted a survey of more than 400 people. It found that:

One respondent, who had cataracts, claimed to have been denied further treatment at a hospital after complaining about being fitted with the wrong eye lens.

He said: ‘A surgeon wrote to my GP saying, “Because this gentleman has made a complaint, we feel that it would be better served if he was seen elsewhere.” ’

The father-of-four believed the hospital had ‘turned its back’ on him as a result of his complaint.

Another respondent, who suffered seizures after a routine hernia operation, was dubbed a ‘serial complainer’ when she raised the problem.

Neither patient wanted to be named for fear of angering their doctors further.

Miss Bradley added: ‘People are being branded troublemakers and experiencing ongoing problems with their care as a result of complaining.

‘The troubling thing about the case studies that we found is that, quite clearly, there is a reason to be scared. Very often, people walk away [from complaining] because they know that – even if one period of treatment is complete – they are bound to need the services of the same people again.’

Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the public inquiry, concluded that a poor complaints system ‘allows unacceptable practice to persist’

She said improvements had been made to the complaints system since spring last year, when the report into the appalling care suffered by thousands at Stafford Hospital was published.

Hundreds are thought to have died unnecessarily at the West Midlands hospital during the previous decade.

Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the public inquiry, concluded that a poor complaints system ‘allows unacceptable practice to persist’, ‘aggravates the grievance’ felt by the patient and ‘undermines the public’s trust in the service’.

A Department of Health spokesman claimed the Stafford Hospital scandal had been ‘a turning point for the NHS’ and the Service was ‘now more transparent than ever before’.

She added: ‘Feedback is essential so mistakes are not repeated. The Care Quality Commission now includes complaints-handling as part of their independent new inspection regime.’
