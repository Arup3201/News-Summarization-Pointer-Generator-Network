Denis Suarez scored a late winner for Sevilla as they came from behind to take control of the Europa League quarter-final tie against Zenit St Petersburg 2-1. 

Winger Aleksandr Ryazantsev had given the visitors the lead in the first-half, scoring off his own rebound, before forward Carlos Bacca drew the home side level with a close-range header from a set-piece. 

Suarez, on loan from from Barcelona, then completed the comeback with a stunning volleyed effort from outside the box on 87 minutes.

Meanwhile,in Ukraine, Fiorentina rescued a 1-1 draw away to Dynamo Kiev, with Khouma Babacar's stoppage-time leveler saving the Italian team from a third straight defeat in all competitions.

Jeremain Lens had given Dynamo a first-half lead with a fine curling 20-yard shot into the far top corner as Fiorentina's players pulled back to defend their own penalty area. 

Finally, in Belgium, Club Brugge and Dnipro ended in a goalless stalemate.

That keeps Brugge in contention for a first European semifinal since 1988, when the competition was still known as the UEFA Cup.
