Leicester defender Marcin Wasilewski will face no punishment from the Football Association over an apparent elbow on West Brom striker Saido Berahino.

Berahino complained that the Polish defender had deliberately elbowed him in the second half of Albion's 1-0 win at the King Power Stadium on Saturday.

But the FA said that as the incident took place while both players battled for the ball, the officials were likely to have seen it and therefore deemed it unworthy of retrospective action.

Meanwhile, Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson launched a staunch defence of Wasilewski in the aftermath of the incident, telling Berahino to stop ‘bleating’ and ‘moaning’.

Despite the controversy the Baggies ran out 1-0 winners at the King Power stadium after Esteban Cambiasso's own goal.
