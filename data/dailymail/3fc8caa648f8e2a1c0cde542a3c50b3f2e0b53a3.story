Australian Zaky Mallah, the first person charged with terrorism in Australia, is hoping to be signed up to fight with a Ukrainian military unit which is recruiting Australians.

The Asov Battalion - which Sydney man Mr Mallah, who was jailed in maximum security for two years before being acquitted of terrorism charges, has applied to join - has set up a Facebook page in its recruitment drive for men to join for a minimum two months.

The battalion describes itself as a military wing of the Ukrainian Government and is open to 'all foreign volunteers' to join a revolution

'This is a revolution for idealists... You will get over here and will find only problems, war, adventure, maybe death, serious wounds, but for sure also great memories and friends for a lifetime,' the revolution's call to arms poster reads.

Australian man Zaky Mallah, 30 (pictured in his western Sydney apartment with the flag of moderate Syrian rebel group, the Islamic Front) travelled to Syria in 2012 and went on the frontline with the Free Syrian Army. Now he has applied to go to Kiev and join the Ukrianian group, the Asov Battalion to fight the Russians

Join the revolution: Zaky Mallah was sent this recruitment poster and a Facebook letter asking for foreign volunteers to go to Kiev and fight with a Ukrainian Battalion against Russian forces on the Black Sea

Zaky Mallah is pictured with a firearm on his tour to Syria in 2012, where he met with troops of the Free Syrian Army on the frontline, but 'did not engage in any hostile acts'

Asov Revolution's Vadim, 34, the battalion's deputy commander who goes by the nom-de-guerre 'the Trojan' and does not identify himself for security reasons, is pictured readying fotrifications for volnuteers and troops to fight in the Mariupol area

Zaky Mallah said he is 'just waiting' for the Ukrainian battalion group Asov to contact him after he applied to join up and fight the Russians in a region on the Black Sea

All volunteers have to do is get themselves to the Ukrainian capital of Kiev and prepare to become a fighter, a combat trainer or an interpreter.

'Just get there and they will take care of you,' the Asov Revolution page says.

'Sleeping, eating, basic training at our Kyiv [Kiev] military base, etc until you are fit enough and are ready to be sent to our base in the southeast of Ukraine and join the fight.'

Zaky Mallah, 30, from Westmead in western Sydney, has already applied and even though he speaks no Russian or Ukrainian is hoping to qualify with his experience of travelling to the front line in Syria in late 2012 with the Free Syrian Army (FSA).

In 2003, Mallah, a Lebanese Australian, was charged under Australia's then new anti-terrorism laws after he made a video which Federal Police and ASIO said contained a planned suicide attack on Federal Government offices in Sydney.

He spent two years in the high maximum security Multi Purpose Unit at Goulburn prison awaiting trial, before being acquitted. It was only in 2009 that he was able to obtain an Australian passport.

Two years ago Mr Mallah travelled to Syria and lived with the FSA rebels engaged in the bloody civil war against Muslim hardliner President Bashar el Assad 'before it got crazy over there'.

After returning home, he encouraged young people to go to Syria and engage in jihad to experience the freedom fight taken up against El Assad, but since the rise of ISIS and al Nusra he has changed his mind.

The Asov Revolution group (pictured, training volunteers this week in Mariupol) says an 'international unit is now under construction in the Mariupol region' on the Black Sea for the battalion which was a division of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs

It asks applicants to list their military experience, motivation and family and work commitments, and stresses 'that this is a volunteer unit. Nobody is getting paid, including the Ukrainians. We have a very limited budget'

He now describes the extremist group which has taken over the rebel fight in Syria as 'a barbaric cult' and criticises the friend he knew as a teenager, Khaled Sharrouf, for joining ISIS.

'He is full of hate and he is involved in a massive propaganda war with a group that is intent on starting a new Islamic state,' Mr Mallah told Daily Mail Australia.

'But I don't believe he's anywhere near the front line or fighting. Those pictures with the severed heads are propaganda photos and Australians who have joined ISIS are both arrogant and ignorant.

'If the [el Assad] regime ends in Syria there will be a mess, massive in-fighting between the rebel groups.'

He said if he were to return to Syria, he would fight for the moderate group, the Islamic Front, whose flag hangs on the wall in his Sydney apartment.

While Mr Mallah admits he is looking to join the Asov Revolution in Ukraine partly because the Valdimir Putin-backed Russian rebels are also supporters of the al Assad regime in Syria, he says the Ukrianian group is fighting a legitimate battle to retain its territory for its people.

'It's a revolution and I'd like to join in and kick some Russian a**e, but I want to contribute something useful and go to the front line and help with providing food, cleaning military or humanitarian aid, doing security checks, whatever is required.'

Zaky Mallah said he his happy to obey the Asov Battalion edict that as a volunteer he must get himself to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv (pictured) (Kiev) and prepare to become a fighter, a combat trainer or an interpreter. 'Just get there and they will take care of you,' the Asov Revolution page says

Mr Mallah said the Australian Government's laws under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act which precluded its citizens engaging in 'hostile' acts in foreign countries would not apply to him because he did not intend to engage in actual war.

He said before he left he would meet with ASIO or Federal authorities who had delayed in 2012 trip to Syria.

The Asov Revolution group's recruitment literature says an 'international unit is now under construction in the Mariupol region' on the Black Sea for the battalion which was a division of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

'Participation in combat operations is a plus, but not an obligation for volunteers of a certain age who can provide good military training,' the call-up says.

'So basically you need to get to Kyiv when we give you the green light. You will be provided with a telephone number, an e-mail address, and a name of an English speaking person from the Social-National Assembly (SNA), a political branch of Azov battalion.

'Remember that we are the military wing of SNA ... we are Socialist, Nationalist and Radical.

'We do have strong ideas about the future of Ukraine and Europe.

'Nobody is getting paid, this is a revolution for idealists ... You will get over here and will find only problems, war, adventure, maybe death, serious wounds, but for sure also great memories and friends for a lifetime.'
