The 13-year-old grandson of Spain's King Juan Carlos is recovering after accidentally shooting himself in the foot with a shotgun.

Felipe Juan Froilan was doing target practice outside the family home north of Madrid, when he misfired into his foot as he walked.

It is thought the safety catch may have been off, which caused the  small 36 calibre shotgun to accidentally fire.

 Under 14s are banned from owning and discharging firearms in Spain

Widely known in Spanish media as simply Froilan, Felipe Juan Froilan is the son of King Juan Carlos's eldest daughter Infanta Elena.

He was treated at Santa Barbara Hospital in Soria before being transferred 
to the private Quiron clinic in the capital to have the wound surgically cleaned.      

This afternoon Felipe's grandmother,  Queen Sofia visited her eldest grandchild - his mother, Princess Infanta Elena spent the night at his bedside.

Upon leaving the hospital the Spanish Queen said: 'Kids do give you shocks,' but added he was playing with his mobile phone when she left him.

Worried mother: His mother Princess Infanta Elena, left, who is the eldest daughter of the King and divorced from Felipe’s father, Jaime de Marichalar, right, spent the night at his bedside

The palace said he was with his 
father, Jaime de Marichalar, who is divorced from his mother, at their 
home in the town of Soria when the incident happened on Monday 
afternoon.

Tragic: In March 1956, Juan Carlos was handling a gun that accidentally went off and killed his 14-year-old younger brother Alfonso pictured

Under Spanish law, it is illegal for children under 14 to possess or discharge firearms.

A palace official declined to comment on the infraction.

It is now up to a judge to decide whether to punish the boy's father.

Spain's Civil Guard police said he could face a fine of up to  6,000 euros (£4,980).

It was not the first shooting incident in the royal family's history.

In March 1956, Juan Carlos was handling a gun that accidentally went off and killed his 14-year-old younger brother Alfonso.

The
 king, then 18, was reported to have been completely shocked and 
devastated and was said to have told family and friends that he 'felt 
responsible.'

The accident happened in Estoril, Portugal.

The
 royal family has been the focus of much media attention in recent 
months.

There has been a judicial probe into whether the king's son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin, used his privileged position to secure 
lucrative deals for a nonprofit foundation he ran, then fraudulently 
diverted some of the money for personal benefit.
