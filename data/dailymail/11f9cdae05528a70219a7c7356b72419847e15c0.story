A radical ‘artificial egg’ made from plants is set to go global after the US firm behind it revealed major backing from Asia's richest man.

Made from plants, it can replace eggs in everything from cakes to mayonnaise - without a chicken ever coming close to the production process.

Hampton Creek's products are already sold in Whole Foods in California, and now the firm plans to take on the world.

MailOnline was able to try two of Hampton Creek’s products - its mayonnaise, and cookies made using its baking product.

The results were surprising, if a little anticlimactic. Both tasted exactly as you would expect - and are indistinguishable from products made with real egg.

The chocolate chip cookies we tried were excellent - crumbly, moist and with a feel in the mouth identical to a normal cookie. Crucially, they also look identical to a normal cookie - despite containing no egg.

Hampton Creek’s ‘Beyond Egg’ mayonnaise was also extremely similar to ‘normal’ mayo - and after trying it out on a few friends, some even preferred to to normal mayonnaise.

Today that it was announced the firm has landed $23 million infunding.

Backers include Mr. Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest man and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang.

In the last 90 days, the company has also signed partnership agreements with 6 Fortune 500 companies, including some of the largest food manufactures and retailers in the world - although the firm is keeping their names secret until products go on sale.

Mr. Li Ka-shing, who is estimated to be worth $28.8 billion, said he believed the firm had huge potential.

'Technology enables everyone to have more options to better our future together,' he said.

'To keep up with all the demands for the growing global population, we need to be more efficient, more environmentally friendly, and have more quality and affordable choices.

Hampton Creek CEO and founder Josh Tetrick said, 'We live in a time where the unhealthy choice is dirt cheapand convenient, and the healthy choice is pricey and inconvenient.

'When my Dad walks the grocery aisles to buy mayo or chocolate-chip cookies or eggs, the inputs that make them possible often come from bizarrely unhealthy places.

'Our goal has always been to build a company that brings healthier and affordable food to everyone, everywhere.

Solving a problem means actually solving the problem for most people – not just the folks that can afford to pay $5.99 for organic eggs.

‘We want to take animals out of the equation,' Tetrick has previously told MailOnline.

‘The food industry is begging for innovation, especially where animals are involved - it is a broken industry.’ 

Tetrick’s idea was to find a mix of easy-to-grow plants that, when mixed together in the right way, replicate the taste, nutritional values and cooking properties of an egg.

This, he believes will allow the firm to produce its substitute for mass market foods - and to allow developing worlds to grow their own versions with added nutrients.

‘Eggs are functionally incredible, they do everything from hold oil and water in mayo to making the muffin rise and holding scrambled eggs together,’ he said ‘I started to think what if we can find plants that can do this. We have about 12 plants pre-selected, including a pea already widely grown in Canada. There’s also a bean in South Asia that is incredible in scrambled eggs.

The firm is already in talks with major food manufacturers around the world - including several in the UK, to replace eggs in supermarket products with their alternative.

So far, he says the team has perfected an egg substitute for mayonnaise, and one for cakes.

'We can make really good mayonnaise, we’ve done taste tests against market leaders, and beaten them consistently. In the world of cookies, we’ve trialled our products with everyone from Bill Gates to Tony Blair, both of whom couldn’t taste the difference.

'Bill Gates became an advisor to the company, and has been one of its most vocal supporters in the Silicon Valley world where Hampton Creek is based.

'Companies like Hampton Creek Foods are experimenting with new ways to use heat and pressure to turn plants into foods that look and taste just like meat and eggs,' he recently wrote of the firm.

It hopes to allow developing countries to grow and produce their own ‘plant eggs’.

'In developing countries, we can also add in things missing from the local diet, helping nutrient deficiencies, and we have had initial discussion with the world food programme about this.

'What we want to do eventually is find a way to work with farmers in the developing world to enable them to have new cash crops that can be used. Then we become the kind of company to be feared by the bad guys in the industry.'

 The team initially struggled to create a product that worked.

'Our first attempts weren’t great, we tried to make a muffin using a mix of plants,' said Hampton Creek boss Josh Tetrick.

'Ours tasted really gummy, and didn’t have the ‘bounce’ we wanted.

'Our mayonnaise would not hold the oil and egg together, so had what looked like liquid syrup. Scrambled eggs were even worse - they just wouldn’t congeal at all, and had a really bad aftertaste.

Tetrick admits the firm is struggling with artificial scrambled egg. He says there is a ‘pretty good’ recipe, but admits more work is needed.

'Eventually we’ll get to one thing that will replace everything,' he said.
