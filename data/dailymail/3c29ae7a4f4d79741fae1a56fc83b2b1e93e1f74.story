Miss De Gerin-Ricard collided with a lorry outside Aldgate East Tube station while she rode home

The family of the first person to be killed on a 'Boris bike' watched as the moment she was knocked off her wheels by a lorry was shown to her inquest.

The parents, brother and sisters of Philippine De Gerin-Ricard, 20, wept as CCTV footage was played showing the moment the French-born student died.

Coroner Mary Hassell warned the images were 'very very graphic' as she prepared the De Gerin-Ricards and the HGV driver Richard James, who was at the wheel, for the emotional evidence.

The family watched the CCTV footage, taken from different cameras, showing Miss De Gerin-Ricard as she collided with a lorry outside Aldgate East Tube station while she rode home to Bromley-by-Bow, in east London, on July 5.

She was cycling along one of the London mayorâ€™s so-called flagship commuter cycle routes, though the section she was in provides no segregated space for cycling.

The coroner had introduced the footage with a 'very strong warning' that it shows 'Philippine coming off her bike and I imagine it would be very distressing for her family'.

Turning to Mr James, she added: 'I know this will be very upsetting for you too.'

Mr James, an HGV driver for about 22 years, told Poplar Coroner's Court in east London that  he had been travelling at around 10-12mph in the slow- moving peak traffic at about 7pm.

He was approaching the crossroads and the traffic lights were probably on red.

There was scaffolding from building works at one side of the road.

Mr James told the inquest the first he knew of the crash was the sound of a 'tinkling or rattling noise which I thought was my mirrors catching the scaffolding.'

He added: 'Then I could see a young lady tumbling backwards off her bike. Then I stopped.'

His lorry was positioned 'squarely' in the lane, the court heard.

Within minutes, an ambulance was at the scene and a bus driver and passers-by had stopped to try to help.

Miss De Gerin-Ricard, who suffered a collapsed left lung, died of multiple injuries

Miss De Gerin-Ricard, who suffered a 
collapsed left lung, was rushed to the nearby Royal London Hospital but 
died of multiple injuries.

Asked by the coroner if in hindsight there was anything he could have done differently, Mr James shook his head and said 'No'.

Asked if there was anything he could suggest to help with the safety of road cyclists, he told the court: 'Possibly with the bicycle hire scheme - the Boris bikes - they could give reflective clothing with the bikes for the riders.'

On seeing the crash, bus driver Richard Brown hit a special button in his cab which contacted the emergency services, he told the inquest.

He noticed it was 'very narrow' between the lorry and the scaffolding.

'It did not occur to me that she collided with the lorry but she did seem to wobble slightly, at which point she fell backwards to her right side and into the lorry,' he recalled.

'I really feel there was not sufficient space for Philippine to pass or attempt to pass the lorry. I think the gap was too small to go by the lorry safely.'

Asked by the coroner for some potential safety points, he suggested that perhaps roads should be kerbed off for riders at junctions, and high visibility clothes for them would also be helpful.

Investigating officer Pc Mike Andrews told the inquest the front of the lorry collided with the rear wheel of the bicycle.

Miss De Gerin-Ricard had been riding on the footpath before passing the scaffolding, possibly in a move to try to get past a bus.

Pc Andrews said: 'Philippine is coming
down the passenger side of the lorry. The lorry has just started moving
but she is moving faster and is able to move in front of the lorry.

'Their
speeds, at some point, would be the same but the lorry is still able to
go quicker and collides with the rear of the bicycle.'

Miss De Gerin-Ricard's mother, Anne Boudet du Mochet (centre), pleaded for road safety for cyclists in London to be tackled 'now and quickly'

CCTV of the dreadful moment the student came off her bike was played at Poplar Coroner's Court

There would have been about 3.72 seconds in which Miss De Gerin-Ricard could have been spotted, according to Pc Andrews.

He went on: 'As Mr James conducted his pre-movement check in the mirrors, Philippine was riding on the footpath - at best she would have been on the very limit of his view.

'With the other pedestrians at the bus stop and milling around, it would have been quite difficult for him to recognise her as a bicycle rider.'

Miss De Gerin-Ricard's mother, Anne Boudet du Mochet, pleaded for road safety for cyclists in London to be tackled 'now and quickly'.

Through an interpreter, she told the court: 'I do not reside here - I live in France - but I am speaking for people who still live and will be living in London.

'There were a number of factors that have come together. The accident did happen, but as Philippine's mum I have seen the impact on all those people who cycle.

'The accident Philippine had was the straw that broke the camel's back.

'The problem with cycle lanes here in London is not a new problem. Things have been asked by cyclists - if anything had been done, it has not been helpful to cyclists.

'I have heard the clothing that cyclists wear and what Philippine should have been wearing was discussed here.

'What needs to be discussed is the provisions of lanes for cyclists. Action needs to be taken.

'Today it is my family who is living in this situation and it is also the driver's family too. Significant action must be taken now and quickly.'
