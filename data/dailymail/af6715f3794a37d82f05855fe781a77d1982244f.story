QPR are confident of fending off the challenge of Palace for
£8million defender Caulker while Leicester have upped their package for striker Campbell.

The pair were not on the plane when Cardiff left for their pre-season tour to Austria on Thursday.

QPR and Crystal Palace are also interested in Southampton midfielder Jack Cork.

Target: Leicester are closing in on the capture of striker Fraizer Campbell

Southampton are holding out on offering 
Cork a new deal as new manager Ronald Koeman runs the rule over him and 
defender Jose Fonte, who is also moving into the last year of his 
current deal.

Crystal Palace have yet to make a summer signing despite have a bid accepted by Tottenham for Gylfi Sigurdsson.

Leicester have also signed former Manchester United trainee Louis Rowley, 19, and had a £7million fee accepted for Leonardo Ulloa of Brighton on Friday.
