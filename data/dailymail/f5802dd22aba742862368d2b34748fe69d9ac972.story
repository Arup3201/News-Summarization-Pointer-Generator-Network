Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League and Football League fixtures.

1. Mauricio Pochettino wants his Tottenham team to defend from the front and both Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen are getting the message.

The two young forwards scored a goal each in the 2-1 win at Swansea but it was their work rate that helped make sure Spurs survived a furious second half onslaught.

Kane and Eriksen both ran 8.2 miles in the 90 minutes – putting them jointly into second place behind Hull's George Boyd for the furthest distance covered by any Premier League player this season.

2. Raheem Sterling missing a couple of gilt-edged chances at Old Trafford might be a sign that he's suffering from carrying the weight of Liverpool's attacking hopes without Luis Suarez or Daniel Sturridge.

The England winger celebrated his 20th birthday only last week but is being asked to do a more experienced player's job.

Amid all the chopping and changing by Brendan Rodgers in search of a winning formula, Sterling has missed only one game, and only twice has he not been in the starting XI.

Since the start of the World Cup he has now started 24 matches, only one less than he did in the whole of the last domestic season.

3. Paul Lambert is trying to change Aston Villa's game plan to a more patient possession style – keeper Brad Guzan was passing goal kicks to his full backs Alan Hutton and Aly Cissokho standing near the corner flags.

The new tactics are a work in progress as the 1-0 defeat by West Brom proved – but it did mean that even with 10 men, Villa hit more passes (438) than they've managed in all but two of their previous Premier League away games this season.

4. Even after scoring 22 goals last season Arsenal fans remain divided about Olivier Giroud's quality, but his strike rate this injury-hit year tells its own story.

Two goals against Newcastle took him to five for the season in all competitions from just 460 minutes on the pitch – a goal every 92 minutes. New hero Alexis Sanchez has needed 136 minutes each for the 13 he has scored.

5. Burnley goalscorer Ashley Barnes had to wait for his Premier League chance but the 25-year-old is making the most of it now.

The 1-0 win over Southampton was his seventh start and Sean Dyche's side have taken 12 points from those games.

The forward who began his career playing part-time football for Paulton Rovers near his Bath home is making a difference with his work rate – he was involved in 24 duels for the ball against Saints, the second highest of any player in Saturday's top flight games.

6. Kevin Nolan's days as a West Ham regular looked numbered with the 32-year-old club captain left on the bench for six weeks after recovering from injury.

But Andy Carroll's return to fitness has given him a new lease of life – the 1-1 draw at Sunderland was his third start in a row.

Re-uniting Nolan and Carroll has also helped Stewart Downing get more chance to be effective – between them they found the England winger 13 times with passes.

7. It could be a long January for Crystal Palace when Yannick Bolasie is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The 25-year-old winger's tricks and flicks have an end product – the 63 crosses he has now put over is getting on for twice that of any other Selhurst Park player.

He's fourth in the Premier League charts for most crosses – three ahead of Manchester United's Angel di Maria. (Southampton's Dusan Tadic is top by a distance with 114).

8. Just when things were settling down at Cardiff, owner Vincent Tan is heading for another fall-out with the club's supporters.

The Malaysian billionaire, who changed the club's shirt from blue to red, has now sanctioned a new away kit in all white with red trimmings.

They wore it for the first time in the 5-3 defeat at Bournemouth, with the rather spurious claim that it was because they thought their normal blue change gear would clash with red and black stripes.

But the suspicion among die-hard fans is that superstitious Tan, who believes red is a lucky colour, will now have the opportunity to consign the colour blue to the club's history books.

9. Teenage sensation Matt Grimes is not letting his forthcoming £1.75million move to Swansea stop him performing at the top of his game for Exeter.

The 19-year-old, whose pay packet will jump from £500 to £10,000 per week when he joins the Swans in January, could have hid against Carlisle to make sure injury didn't wreck his big move.

Instead he made one goal and scored the other as the Grecians won 2-0 to move into the League Two play-off places.

10. Former Ipswich defender Tony Humes is facing his first big crisis since starting his management career in charge of Colchester after watching his team ship four goals at home to Rochdale.

The 48-year-old, whose previous coaching experience was all with the club's youth system, has to find a way to pick up a side who let in six at MK Dons the week before.

He's not helped himself by publicly questioning the commitment of his players.
