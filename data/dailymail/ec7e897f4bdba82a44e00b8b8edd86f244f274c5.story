A British woman has spoken in public 
for the first time about the ordeal of being snatched by Somali pirates 
who killed her husband.

Judith Tebbutt, 56, told how an armed gang abducted her last September from a beach resort in Kenya.

Speaking yesterday via Skype at the 
trial of a Kenyan man accused of abducting her, the partially deaf 
social worker told how she and her husband of 26 years, David, 58, were 
attacked just hours after arriving at the secluded Kiwayu Safari Village
resort, near Kenya’s border with Somalia.

The mother-of-one, from Bishop’s 
Stortford in Hertfordshire, told the court she had felt uneasy when she 
arrived at the remote hotel because she and her husband were the only 
guests.

And her fears were born out when they were attacked on their first night at the resort.

The widow then described how she woke up to see her husband grappling with somebody in the room.

She said: 'The next thing I was aware of was that the lights were on and I heard David and he must've been shouting.

'He looked as though he was grappling with something that was taller than him, because his arms were raised above his shoulders.

'I was then aware of someone prodding me at my shoulder and at the same time I realised that the sheets were off the bed.

'I looked and saw there were two men 
there, both had rifles, and I remember thinking "I wonder if this is 
security or something", because it was just so unreal.'

She continued: 'David was still grappling or fighting with something.

'I got pulled out of bed and they 
were inside the mosquito net, because one man was on my right-hand side 
holding the tops of my arms very tightly and pulling me towards the 
door.

'I remember shouting "what's 
happening, what's happening" and I could still see David and the next 
thing I knew I was out of the door.'

Mrs Tebbutt told the court she 
screamed as she was being pulled away from her husband and was hit 
around the head by one of the gang.

She said: 'I screamed twice and on my second scream I was hit around my head.

'Not very hard or anything, it was a bit pathetic really. It was just like a little tap.

'At this stage we were on the beach running very fast and I was getting out of breath.

'I stumbled and was pulled up by my hair, but I was able to reach back and I scratched a hand or something.

'I got hit in the lower back by what I
assumed was the butt of a rifle because I had seen them pointing rifles
at me in the room.'

She was put on to a boat with five men and spent seven months in captivity before being released on March 19.

Mrs Tebbutt realised the men wanted a ransom when she asked them where they were taking her.
She said: 'This person was rubbing his thumb and fingers saying, "Money, money, money".

'I thought, "OK, I’m being kidnapped for money. That’s OK, they will ask for money. It will be paid and I will go home".'

She did not go into detail about her time as a hostage or describe how or when she realised her husband was dead.

Mr Tebbutt’s body was discovered in the couple’s bedroom after her abduction. He had been shot in the chest.

Former hotel worker Ali Babitu Kololo, 25, is charged with robbery and kidnapping.

The father of two, who was arrested 
in the days after the kidnapping, has previously admitted helping lead 
the gunmen to the Tebbutts' bedroom on the night of the attack, but 
claims he did so only after they forced him at gunpoint.

Mrs Tebbutt told the court she had 
not seen him on the night of her abduction but said the gang of five 
pirates had told her a sixth man was involved.

She said: 'Since my return from 
captivity, I have seen pictures on the internet in the presence of my 
son Oliver of a black male in a green T-shirt who was obviously 
handcuffed and detained in Kenya in relation to the death of David.'

She added: 'David was grappling with 
someone I could not see, so there could have been other people in the 
banda I am unaware of.'

Earlier Mrs Tebbutt had told how  she
and her husband, whom she had know for 32 years, had been driven in a 
golf buggy from a landing strip to the hotel, where they realised after 
lunch they were alone apart from staff.

She said: 'I was beginning to get this very strange feeling that something didn't feel right and I didn't feel comfortable.'

Mrs Tebbutt, who wore a white blouse 
and black suit as she gave evidence, described how the couple were led 
along the beach to their grass-woven grass hut bedroom 'banda'.

She felt uneasy when she realised the
couple's room had no doors or windows, but said her husband tried to 
put her mind at ease by saying they would have a 'Robinson Crusoe 
experience'.

Mrs Tebbutt said: 'David and I 
entered the banda, which was absolutely huge. I remember saying to 
David, "I'm not sure about this, because there's no doors or windows".

'He replied "No, this is going to be a Robinson Crusoe experience".

'I remember thinking to myself that I was not sure if I liked a Robinson Crusoe experience.

'I wanted somewhere I could lock and again, it just didn't feel right, it didn't feel comfortable, but that was just a feeling.'

Mrs Tebbutt recalled how the bedroom's front door was simply a roller blind.

She described the inside of the 
massive room, saying it had hammocks, a bookcase, sleeping and dressing 
areas and a bathroom with twin sinks.

A shower was located in an outside area backed by trees.

She said: 'I thought "I've never been anywhere like this before", but it appeared very nice and very luxurious.'

Mrs Tebbutt said she and her husband 
were on the second week of their holiday when they arrived at the Kiwayu
Safari Village, having spent a week in Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve.

The couple walked along the beach to 
have a meal of fish and potatoes in the restaurant and Mrs Tebbutt said 
it suddenly struck her that they should put their valuables in the hotel
safe.

The Tebbutts later enjoyed some gin and tonics while chatting to the hotel owner in the bar and then returned to their bedroom.

Mrs Tebbutt put her jewellery in a wooden box in the bedroom.

She said: 'When I say jewellery I mean it was my earrings, three Tiffany bangles and my watch which operates my hearing aids.'

On the first night of their Kiwayu stay, Mrs Tebbutt described how she and her husband held hands as they drifted off to sleep.

'We just got straight into bed and when we slept, we normally started off sleeping holding hands - we always did that.'

And the next thing she knew, her seven-month ordeal was just beginnning.

Kololo has been held in custody since
his arrest and was present to hear Mrs Tebbutt's evidence, which was 
shown on a television screen in a courtroom on the Kenyan island of 
Lamu.

The widow spent two hours slowly reading her statement, which was translated into the suspect's native Swahili.

Kololo was then given the chance to cross-examine the witness and asked her two questions to confirm she had not seen him at the hotel and did not know him.

Mrs Tebbutt also gave descriptions of the kidnappers she had seen - none of which have been arrested and are thought to be in Somalia.

It is thought the widow's release came after her family arranged to pay a £800,000 ransom to the gang.

Her son Oliver flew to Kenya's capital Nairobi to meet her after she was freed in March.

Kololo was remanded again in custody following yesterday's hearing, which also heard evidence from Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Neil Hibberd.

The officer, who works for Scotland Yard's counter-terror unit, was one of a team of detectives who flew to Kenya to help probe the tragedy last September.

He told the court that footprints found on the beach following Mrs Tebbutt's abduction appeared to match the brand of shoe that Kololo was wearing when he was arrested.

The officer added that a trail of footprints suggested the gang had peered into other banda huts before targeting the Tebbutts.

Several other Metropolitan officers are also believed to have returned to Lamu and are expected to give evidence when the trial resumes today.
