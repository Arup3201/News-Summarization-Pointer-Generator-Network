Forget the latest It bag or designer outfit, it seems if you really want to grab attention on the awards red carpet, all you need to do is take your child along with you.

It's an approach taken by a number of celebrities who took their offspring to last night's Grammy Awards - despite the show taking place past their bedtimes.

Rapper Wiz Khalifa, 27, who was nominated for two awards, was joined by his two-year-old son Sebastian.

Wiz Khalifa recently split from his his son's mother, model Amber Rose, 31, so perhaps he wanted to make the most of spending quality time with his little boy.

Sebastian melted hearts on the red carpet as he tried to grab the microphones of those interviewing his father, whose real name is Cameron Jibril Thomaz. 

The rapper told E! News why he took the toddler to the awards ceremony.

'We're just out here having fun. I brought my mom with me as well. We're celebrating. You're never gonna get these types of memories again, so I would just rather share them with him... have him be a part of it,' he explained.

Beyonce and Jay Z's daughter Blue Ivy was also at the Grammys and was pictured with Rihanna

Rihanna sure does know how to make an entrance! The talented songstress is not afraid to take risks when it comes to fashion, and tonight it definitely paid off. She chose a rose colored tiered ball gown from Giambattista Valli's Haute Couture line and made this one of her most memorable red carpet appearances yet.

The style icon award winner loves to show off her flawless skin and multiple tattoos in crop tops, sheer frocks, and backless numbers, so it was refreshing to see the Fourfiveseconds singer all covered up, but still serving major sex appeal.

Rihanna's designer of choice is no stranger to  red carpet dressing. His lavish looks have been worn by a countless number of A-listers including Lena Dunham and Lupita Nyong'o.

This couture creation isn't readily available to the public. But we've got some Cinderella inspired gowns in our edit to make up for the loss. Starting at around $100 this is an excellent investment for your next big event.

Meanwhile actor Jamie Foxx, 47, was joined by his five-year-old daughter Annalise Bishop.

His little girl gave him the perfect excuse to bag himself a number of pictures of the stars as he took pictures of her on his phone with everyone from Sir Paul McCartney and Madonna to Jay Z and Pharrell Williams.

Annalise took the encounters with the world's most famous musicians in her stride, striking a pose giving the peace sign.

Jamie uploaded a number of his snaps to his Instagram account where he revealed who his daughter's favourite popstar was.

'Thanks Katy Perry for making my daughter's night!' he wrote with a picture of Annalise being hugged by the Firework singer.

Jamie makes sure he gets a picture of his daughter meeting Sir Paul McCartney, who found fame with the Beatles decades before she was born

Jamie later uploaded the picture to his Instagram account with the caption 'Jay and my little one'

Annalise found fans herself in Madonna and Rihanna who couldn't resist giving her a cuddle and pinching her cheeks.

Another star who made the night a family affair was Melissa Rivers, 47, who was accompanied on the red carpet by her son Cooper Endicott, 14.

The night was bittersweet for the pair who accepted an award for Best Spoken Word Album posthumously given to Melissa's mother, Joan Rivers, who died last September. 

The most famous little girl at the Grammy was Beyonce and Jay Z's daughter Blue Ivy.

Her parents picked up awards for best R and B performance and best R and B song for Drunk In Love while Beyonce also took to the stage to perform Take My Hand.

Annalise also met singer Ed Sheeran who was nominated for a number of Grammys

But while the three-year-old has appeared on stage with her famous parents at awards shows in the past, this time they kept her out of the limelight.

She wasn't pictured with her parents on the red carpet although she was later seen inside the STAPLES Center where she was made of a fuss of by Rihanna.

The popstar crouched down in her elaborate pink Valli gown to chat to the little girl - who was also dressed in pink.

Meanwhile, stars who didn't have a child on their arm took this pets instead. Singer Charli XCX and Shani James both took their dogs to aftershow parties. 

Melissa Rivers was accompanied on the red carpet by her son Cooper Endicott, 14, as they accepted a posthumous award for their mother/grandmother, the late Joan Rivers
