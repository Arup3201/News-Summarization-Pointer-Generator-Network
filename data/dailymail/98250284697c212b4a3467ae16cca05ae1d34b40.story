Benihana founder Hiroaki ‘Rocky’ Aoki’s widow is fighting with his famous children over millions she says they looted from his estate the night before he died.

Keiko Ono Aoki, 59, says the restaurateur’s six children, including model Devon Aoki and DJ Steve Aoki, swindled $3million from their ailing father July 9, 2008 as he ‘lay dying in his hospital bed.’

Keiko Ono Aoki, his third wife, only gained control of the $35million estate last year, and her late husband’s children claim the money was from a trust she had no rights over, according to a New York Post report.

Rocky Aoki realized the American dream with his vast empire of teppanyaki resturants where food is theatrically grilled at the same table diners eat at. He set up a trust for his children 10 years prior to his death after being convicted of insider trading.

The former Japanese Olympic wrestling qualifier named sons Kevin and Kyle, daughter Kana Grace and close friend Kenneth Podziba trustees – Keiko Ono Aoki was not named.

Trusts grant trustees the right to distribute funds at their discretion – which happened to be the eve of their patriarch’s death.

‘Keiko had no more right to notice [of the money transfer] than did Rocky’s doctors or chauffeur, as she is not a named beneficiary,’ a court filing cited by the Post claims.

The pair married in 2002 without a prenuptial agreement, and the founder had previously sued his children over the attempts to wrestle control over his steakhouse empire from him after he had children by at least three different women, according to New York magazine.

The money was handed out at that time because two of his children were ‘in dire need’ of cash, a source told the paper. The funds were distributed equally among the six children.

Daughter Devon, known for movie roles such as 'Sin City' and walking runways all over the world, and son Steve, a DJ who tours the world and has permanent residence in a Las Vegas nightclub, were not likely among those who needed cash - but they still received their cuts.

Keiko Ono Aoki is now CEO of Beniahana and has overseen expansion to 100 locations around the world, according to the company’s website.

Her late husband qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome but did not compete, instead choosing to barnstorm around the United States where he went undefeated.

Rocky leveraged the fame garnered from three consecutive national championships to open the first Benihana in 1964 in Midtown Manhattan.

He died of pneumonia the day following the cash grab.

Podziba declined to comment when reached by the Post, the attorney for Keiko Ono Aoki told the paper the dispute was ‘not uncommon.’
