She made her debut on TV hit Homeland on Sunday night - playing a new Muslim CIA analyst tasked with tracking down terrorists by gruff boss Saul Berenson.

But Nazanin Boniadi has already been on a 'mission' of her own after it was alleged she was vetted to become Tom Cruise's girlfriend by Scientology chiefs - and told she was 'going to save the world'.

The stunning 31-year-old actress plays rookie analyst Fara in the Showtime series, but she hit the headlines last year after Vanity Fair reported that Nazanin was secretly chosen to date A list star Tom, 51, before he married Katie Holmes - and the pair enjoyed a brief romance.

Maureen
Orth, a special correspondent for Vanity Fair, last year claimed in a bombshell article that  Scientology 
officials auditioned 'dozen of young women' for Tom Cruise prior to his 
marriage to Katie in 2009.

And she alleged that Iranian-born, London-raised Nazanin 'was told she was being chosen for a mission' and was 'really going to save the world'.

Maureen also claimed that Nazanin did not know what was in store for her - or that she would end up meeting Cruise.

The claims were strenuously denied by the Church of Scientology at the time.

However, the writer told Good Morning America in September 2012: '[She] was told that she was being chosen for a mission, that was really
going to save the world. That she was going to be meeting 
dignitaries, that it was very important that she look good, and be 
worldly.'

She went on: 'And she had no idea, when it began, that [she] was going to end
up meeting Tom Cruise.'

Nazanin has appeared on TV in a number of series including comedy How I Met Your Mother, but her appearance on Homeland could prove to be her biggest role yet.

Millions watched as the slight brunette made her debut as Fara, a young Persian transactions analyst brought in to help Saul trace the Langley bombing operation's funding and its origins.

She was left in tears as Saul chided her for not working hard enough and pointing out to her headscarf, raged: 'That thing you're wearing on your head... is
one big 'f**k you' to the people you work with," he tells her. "Give me
a goddamn plan or don't say anything.'

But Fara retaliated by bringing in the bankers suspected of illegally partnering with an Iranianin trading company - before discovering that the usual banking fees removed from wire transfers had simply disappeared. A total of $45 million had gone to an unknown individual, and Saul suspected finding that money will lead in the right direction.

Vanity Fair published its feature on Cruise just months his third wife, actress Katie Holmes, blindsided him by filing for divorce in June 2012.

Among its claims were that the Mission Impossible star knew that Scientology chiefs were vetting potential love interests for him before he started dating Katie, 34, in 2005.

In the article, Orth claimed that a project to identify a new partner for Cruise, following
the break-up of his relationships with Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz,
started in 2004 and was headed by Shelly Miscavige, wife of the 
church's top official David Miscavige.

Speaking about the vetting process, she said: 'I do believe that [Cruise] was very 
much aware that it was going on, or at least he had certainly heard 
about her, because by the time he met her he did know all about her.'

Former official Marc Headley, interviewed in the Vanity Fair piece, claimed that a number of Scientologist actresses were interviewed by church leaders and told they were being considered for a role in a new training video.

However, they were allegedly faced with unexpected questions such as: 'What do you think of Tom Cruise?'

Katie
Holmes, who did not become a Scientologist until she started going out 
with Cruise, was not part of this process, the article said.

Instead,
Mrs Miscavige allegedly chose Nazanin Boniadi, then 24, to be the megastar's new 
partner.

The reports went on to claim she was told she had been selected for 'a very 
important mission', and ordered to break up with her boyfriend.

When Nazanin was flown to New York and taken for dinner by Cruise at 
trendy restaurant Nobu, she began to suspect she was part of an 
elaborate set-up, Orth wrote.

The
pair went ice-skating at Rockefeller Center, where the rink had been 
closed for them, then spent the night together, it was alleged.

The actress, who has 
appeared in General Hospital blockbuster Iron
Man, was also made to sign multiple confidentiality agreements over her 
relationship with Cruise, Vanity Fair claimed.

Her
relationship with the star remained a secret, and the couple were together from November 2004 until January 2005, during which time Nazanin allegedly lived with Cruise.

However, she found herself out of favour with Cruise after unintentionally insulting 
church leader Miscavige by saying "Excuse me?" and asking him to repeat himself more 
than once, apparently an indication in Scientology that one is not a 
good communicator or listener.

After their relationship ended, Nazanin was allegedly sent away to the Scientology facilities in Clearwater, Florida, where she was forced to clean toilets with a toothbrush, scrub bathroom tiles with acid and dig ditches in the middle of the night. All the allegations were denied by the Church of Scientology.

However, former Scientologist, director Paul Haggis stated that this was true - and said Nazanin had quit the church in 2010 after 'several years of trying to handle this injustice internally, to no avail'.

And in December 2012, Nazanin released a rap song that made it clear she was no longer associated with Scientology, rapping: 'But we all know how it is/This ain't no road to freedomIt's a blind alley, like Kirstie Alley/Travolta, and Cruise, but we ain't no fools'

Just
a few months after the break-up, Cruise started dating former Dawson's Creek star Katie, 
who converted to Scientology ahead of their marriage in November 2006.

The couple went on to marry in Rome in November 2006 following the birth of their daughter Suri in April 2006. Katie filed for divorce in June 2012 and the split was finalised two weeks later.

Speaking
out: Vanity Fair writer Maureen Orth appeared on Good Morning America 
today where she stood by claims in her article that Scientology 
officials auditioned women to be Tom Cruise's girlfriend

At the time of the Vanity Fair article, the Church of Scientology released a statement that read: 'The entire story
is hogwash. There was no project, secret or otherwise, ever conducted 
by the Church to find a bride (audition or otherwise) for any member of 
the Church. Never. 

'The
allegation and entire premise of the Vanity Fair article is totally 
false. Like clockwork, stories about this 'phantom' audition surface in 
the tabloids every few months. We have been denying this ridiculous tale
now since it first appeared in print FOUR years ago.' 

A spokesman for Cruise also poured cold water on the article, saying: 'Lies in a different font 
are still lies - designed to sell magazines.'
