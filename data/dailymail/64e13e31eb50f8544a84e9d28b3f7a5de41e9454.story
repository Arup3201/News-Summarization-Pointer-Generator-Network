This is the shocking moment a crazed commuter launched an apparently random attack on a woman - pushing her on to the tracks of the London Underground.

The 23-year-old victim struck up a brief conversation with the thug and following a trivial row over the man's hat, he turned and shoved her on to the rails on the Northern Line at Leicester Square.

She only missed the live rail by inches, and was able to pull herself back onto the platform with the help of other travellers before the next train came down the platform.

Injuries to her side were so severe, witnesses initially thought she had been stabbed.

Tipping point: The vicious and dangerous attack was allegedly sparked by a 'trivial' row about the man's hat

Dangerous: The man, in a fit of rage, violently shoves the woman onto the northbound Northern Line track

The attacker risked his victim's life in two ways: She could have been electrocuted by the track's live middle wire, or she could have been hit by an oncoming train

The incident - highlighted on the BBC's six-part The Tube documentary on Monday night - shows the very real dangers faced by commuters and staff each day.

British Transport Police are still hunting the man behind the vicious assault, describing him as smartly dressed.

They said the incident stemmed from a short argument about the attacker's hat.

The incident took place on Friday, September 16, at about 11.20pm, but police are so keen to find the man they have re-appealed again for more information on the back of the BBC's documentary.

Treatment: The woman is removed by paramedics following the attack

The woman suffered a wound to her side and was taken to hospital, while both platforms of the Northern Line were shut for the rest of the evening.

BTP Detective Sergeant Fin Egan, the 
investigating officer, said: 'This was a dangerous and reckless act 
which could have had grave consequences had a Tube train been 
approaching.

'The victim suffered a nasty cut to her side as she landed on the rails, but was able to pull herself back up onto the platform.

'The
 platform was busy at that time and I am appealing for anyone who 
recognises the man in the images or who witnessed the incident to get in
 contact.'
