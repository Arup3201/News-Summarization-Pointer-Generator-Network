Pippa Middleton hit the town again last night but this time she took her beau Nico Jackson with her.

The 29-year-old Celebrate author had dined with her friend Tom Kingston at French restaurant Le caprice in London's Mayfair on Wednesday evening.

But she returned to the affluent area again last night for some quality time with her stockbroker partner, 35.

Dressed up: The author wore a geometric print mini dress with heels

While Pippa had dressed down in jeans
 and blazer for her dinner with banker Tom, she upped the style for her 
date night with Nico.

She wore a a geometric print mini dress from Matthew Williamson's pre-autumn 13 collection that showed off her slender pins.

She accessorised a grey clutch and 
matching Aruna Seth 'Beatrice' shoes - in a remarkably similar style to
 the Rupert Sanderson shoes worn by her sister Kate to the National 
Portrait Gallery on Wednesday evening.

It seems the night out was a double 
date as she joined her brother James and his new girlfriend, TV 
presenter Donna Air, at Loulou's.

The club is a popular party spot with
 the rich and famous and Pippa was in some royal company when she let 
her hair down there yesterday.

She wasn't joined by her sister - the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge or brother-in-law Prince William - but Princess Beatrice was also at the venue with her mother Sarah Ferguson.

Earlier this week Pippa, who is set to become an aunty for the first time in July, attended the opening of a Â£2million charity project at the Mary Hare School for deaf children in Berkshire.

The Waitrose columnist became an ambassador to the school after being introduced to their work through a friend.

The Mary Hare School is a charity for profoundly and severely deaf children and young people from all over the country.

Pippa said: 'It gives me great pleasure to be a supporter of Mary Hare and make a difference to the lives of deaf children. I wanted to help out, because this is a local charity close to my family's home and I have been charmed by the inspiring children that attend, not least for their charismatic and heart-warming attitude to life.'
