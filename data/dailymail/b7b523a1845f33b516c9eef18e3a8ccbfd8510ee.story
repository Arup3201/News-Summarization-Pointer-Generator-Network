Funny man: George Valentine, 76, told 62 one-liners in less than a minute - setting an unofficial record

You won’t recognise him from television, but George Valentine is the undisputed comedy king of the one-liners.

The pensioner has spent a lifetime writing short jokes and has turned out gags for some of the nation’s most-loved comedians.

Now at the age of 76 he is claiming the latest in a series of world comedy records after firing off 62 jokes in one minute.

His other unofficial records include the most jokes told in two minutes – 121.

Mr Valentine has also broken his own record for most jokes told in an hour by reeling off 1,000 of them.

The married father of two posts videos of his record-breaking joke sessions on the internet, but they have not been recognised by Guinness because he uses cue cards, rather than relying on his memory, to tell his jokes.

Mr Valentine, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, worked as a shoe supplier until he retired, but wrote jokes for Bob Monkhouse, Tommy Cooper and Les Dawson in his spare time.

He said: ‘I just did it for a hobby, it wasn’t full time. But then you would see them do them on the telly. It was amazing.’

Mr Valentine estimates that he has come up with 110,000 one-liners since he wrote his first at the age of 12.

Over the decades his talent has not been widely recognised, but word is spreading thanks to the digital age.

Long career: The pensioner claims to have written more than 100,000 jokes since the age of 12 and his gags have been retold by Tommy Cooper, Bob Monkhouse and Les Dawson. He has been paid for their use

Mr Valentine set up a website 
onelinerjokes.co.uk and has now amassed 215,000 followers on Twitter, 
where he tweets short jokes on a daily basis.

‘I’m not in it for any financial gain but I really enjoy doing it,’ he said.

‘I’ll
 only allow myself three minutes to write a joke and will can it if not.
 I usually write a one-liner in about two minutes.’

All
 62 jokes in his ‘most jokes in a minute’ record were between two and 
four words long. They included: ‘Familiarity breeds’, ‘rowing is 
oarsome’, ‘friendly fire isn’t’ and ‘teachers have class’.

His favourite ultra-short joke is ‘obesity cures wrinkles’.
