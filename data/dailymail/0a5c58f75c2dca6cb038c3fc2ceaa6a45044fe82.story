Starbucks could soon be adding an extra fizz to its customers' drinks as it files a trademark name for the range of carbonated drinks it has been testing.

The experiment with carbonated beverages is a bit like giving customers the chance to have their order put through a Soda Stream.

Zack Hutson, a Starbucks spokesman, said the application is related to a new range it started experimenting with at stores in Atlanta and Austin in June.

The Seattle-based coffee company is registering the name Fizzio, which would apply to drinks machines and the beverages they provide, it said in its U.S. Patent and Trademark Office application.

Three fizzy flavors - Lemon Ale, Original Ginger Ale and Spiced Root Beer - have been on offer to customers, who were also given the chance to carbonate iced teas and coffees for no extra charge, the Huffington Post reported.

'So far the response from customers in the test markets has been positive,' Mr Hutson said.

Melody, a coffee lover in Seattle who writes blogs about new drinks products, visited one of the shops testing the carbonated drinks and liked what she saw.

'This was crazy good. Since I knew I wasn’t going to be able to easily return to this Starbucks, I drank two Venti Starbucks root beers! I just couldn’t stop,' she wrote on Starbucks Melody.

'It’s sweet, refreshing, and a lovely distinctive root beer flavor ... Starbucks root beer solidly gets two thumbs up from me!'

However, when Jason Jepson tested all three for CNBC he found them lacking in flavor.

'The flavor was OK, but you can really tell that the mix comes from a box,' he said.

Starbucks spokesman Linda Mills said in response: 'This is a test, and that's part of it.'

She added that many customers had requested to have their regular iced beverages carbonated.

The new test range is the latest in a series of moves by Starbucks, which has more than 19,000 branches around the world, to expand beyond coffee.

The company has also started to move into premium juices with its Evolution Fresh range and, with tea becoming a growth opportunity, it acquired a chain of shops called Teavana.

The move into the soft drinks market is a shrewd decision by Starbucks, which could find itself part of a $77 billion carbonated beverage category.

'Starbucks is ... smart to test these products,' John Sicher, editor of trade magazine Beverage Digest, told USA Today. 'This may help bring in customers who want something other than coffee.'

Each of the three drinks in its test range are described as handcrafted and are made with no preservatives or artificial colors, and contain no high-fructose syrup.
