Want to smell like Cheryl? Now you can, as the popstar and X Factor judge releases the latest scent from her sweet-smelling collection.

Mrs Fernandez-Versini, 31, saw sales of her debut scent, StormFlower, break records when she released it last year and now the star has unveiled an Eau de Toilette, too.

Speaking about the £27 spritz, Cheryl said: 'For my next fragrance I wanted to introduce a twist on my original scent but to maintain its simplicity and beauty.

The star, who sat front row at the couture shows in Paris recently, has clearly taken note.

She continued: 'I love the spring 2015 seasonal colour trends and these inspired me in the creation of my first Eau de Toilette, a perfect addition to my StormFlower range.'

Her second offering is described as a light, feminine fragrance with fresh citrus top notes mixed with a hint of juicy lemon and sweet bergamot.

Expect floral notes of rose and peony, complemented by base notes of musk and sandalwood.

Charitable Cheryl, who has long used her status for good, has also pledged to donate £100,000 from proceeds to Cheryl's Trust, which works with The Prince's Trust to improve the lives of young people in England. 

After previously fronting The Cheryl Cole Foundation, which had a similar manifesto, this is a new endeavour for the singer, who was inspired by her own success and the knowledge she was lucky to be given life-changing opportunities. 

The charity's website reads: 'Cheryl set up her charitable trust to significantly enhance the support available to young people, inspired by the knowledge of how lucky she was to be given the opportunities she had to succeed.'

Turning her words into action, Cheryl teamed up with youth charity, The Prince’s Trust, which was set up by Prince Charles, to help fund a new state-of-the-art centre in Newcastle, which supports disadvantaged young people in the North East. 

Cheryl has committed to raise £2m to help get the centre up and running. When opened, it will support almost 4,000 vulnerable young people in the North East each year to turn their lives around.

Cheryl aims to help the region’s most at-risk young people, including those facing drug and alcohol abuse, homelessness, mental health problems and those leaving care.

Cheryl had previously set up The Cheryl Cole Foundation, in line with The Prince's Trust - she has long been a staunch supporter of Prince Charles' youth charity

Speaking at the launch in January, she said: 'My life could have turned out very differently… I know how lucky I am. That's why I am raising money to open the new centre in Newcastle.

'I want to give back and help young people who feel like they'll never achieve anything reach their dreams and live a happy life.'

Busy Cheryl recently released stills from her new video, Only Human, which has been described by many as 'the best ballad' that the former Girls Aloud star has ever recorded.

Cheryl herself described it as her 'personal favourite so far' to be taken from her current album of the same name, and the song drops on 22nd March.
