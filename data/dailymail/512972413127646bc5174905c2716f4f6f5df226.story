An 11-year-old who fought and survived cancer three years ago has made it her mission to help other kids fighting the disease.

Kylie Simonds, from Naugatuck, Connecticut, was just eight when she was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare bone and soft tissue cancer, and she says the heavy IV pole she had to cart around during chemo sessions made the whole experience harder and scarier.

So the savvy tween came up with a solution: an IV backpack specially designed to accommodate a pump for chemotherapy or transfusions.

Genius invention: Cancer survivor Kylie Simonds, 11, from Naugatuck, Connecticut, has invented an IV backpack that makes it easier and less scary for kids to be hooked up to the IV during chemo

The perfect solution: She says the heavy IV poles she had to cart around during chemo sessions made the whole experience harder and more daunting

The backpack began as a school project that required her to solve an everyday problem; for Kylie, the standard issue IV pole was her own personal everyday issue to overcome.

'It was really scary for me at a young age, which was eight,' she told MSNBC.

'I had to use the big IV poles which were actually really heavy to push around and they had lots of wires and tubes I would trip over or get tangled in.'

To combat these setbacks, Kylie designed a backpack which is fitted with the IV pole on the top corner of the bag. A wire protector around the IV sack ensures that it won't pop if you lean on it, and the medical machine goes inside the bag.

Instead of the clinical white and metal pole patients normally use, Kylie's backpack is pink and Hello Kitty-themed, making it even less threatening to children with cancer. 

And since it straps onto your back, it allows young patients to play and do activities to distract themselves while undergoing chemo.

After 46 weeks of chemotherapy and several surgeries, Kylie was confirmed cancer-free two years ago, and now she's focusing on helping others.

Now, thanks to all the attention she has received for her invention, Kylie hopes to actually get her prototype made so she can provide it to children and hospitals everywhere.

She is asking for supporters to donate money via her Go Fund Me page to make her invention a reality.

So far, she has raised more than $46,000, with an ultimate goal of $50,000 to fund the manufacturing of a usable IV backpack.

Her school was so impressed by the invention that they even picked it to be presented at the UConn Invention Convention, where it won four prizes including the Patent Award - the highest award at the event.

This means that the backpack has been submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to be patented.  

As for the teachers who first gave her the assignment, 'They just flipped!' she laughed.
