Tavaris Reevey, 41, was charged with child endangerment after his son, 4, crashed the family's car into a brick wall while left unattended

A New Jersey father who left his children alone in his car has been charged with child endangerment after his four-year-old son crashed the family's vehicle into a brick wall.

Tavaris Reevey, 41, left his son and two-year-old daughter unattended in a running car.

That's when his four-year-old climbed into the driver's seat and put the car in reverse, backing the vehicle across the parking lot before it struck a brick wall. 

Neither of the children were injured in the crash, according to NJ.com. 

The accident occurred at the Middlebrook Apartment complex in Ocean Township.

Reevey was arrested yesterday at the scene and has since been released.

After the incident, police also learned there was a $250 contempt of court warrant issued for Reevey. 

Future court hearings were planned for both the child endangerment charges and the active warrant. 

New Jersey Department of Child Protection and Permanency were also notified and Reevey's two children were put in the care of their mother.   

Reevey's two-year-old daughter was also in the running car. His son climbed into the driver's seat and put the vehicle in reverse. It backed across a parking lot at the Middlebrook Apartment complex (pictured) in Ocean Township, New Jersey before striking the wall
