An ancient pear tree which could be cut down to make way for the controversial HS2 rail line is to have its DNA preserved so it can be 'cloned'.

The 200-year-old specimen, near the village of Cubbington in Warwickshire, is said to be the second oldest pear tree in Britain.

Parish councillor Peter Delow said: ‘What HS2 is proposing is that the tree will be cut down but, before that, they will take seeds and grafts to preserve its DNA.

The tree is located near the picturesque village of Cubbington in Warwickshire and is one of the oldest in Britain

Local villagers said they would campaign for a tunnel to run under the tree

‘They originally planned to dig it up and relocate it but it’s a 200-year-old tree and they decided the chances of success were too small to warrant the expenditure.’

An HS2 spokesman said: 'We recognise the significance of the tree and will do all we can to ensure wild pear trees continue to be a feature of the countryside around Cubbington.

'Because the hollow lower trunk makes it impractical to move the tree, we instead plan to propagate the cuttings, collect seeds and replant the young trees in the surrounding area.

'The felled tree will be moved to a newly-created woodland next to South Cubbington Wood.'

Villagers said they would continue to lobby MPs for a tunnel beneath the tree and the surrounding woodland.

David Alderman, director of the Tree Register, said it is the largest wild pear recorded in Britain.

Preparatory work on HS2 is set to start in 2016 ahead of building work in 2017. The first phase from London Euston to Birmingham will be completed by 2026, with an ‘accelerated’ section to Crewe finished the following year and the full route to Manchester and Leeds the North by 2030.

HS2 bosses say they'll use cuttings and seeds from the tree to ensure its DNA is preserved

The HS2 scheme, which will see High Speed trains run between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, has sparked angry protests from those living on the route
