Wrestling coach Gary Scott Goins, 46, has been found guilty of raping and molesting  team members

A former high school wrestling coach faces 40 years in prison after being found guilty of raping and molesting his players.

Gary Scott Goins, 46, was found guilty on 17 counts of the 20 brought before him, relating to sex crimes against three members of his East Gaston High School team between 1998 and 2004.

This included oral and anal sex, which Goins would describe as training.

Superior Court Judge Jesse Caldwell sentenced him to a minimum of 34 years and ten months in prison, and a maximum of 43 years and four months.

Goins denies any sexual contact with the victims, and has lodged an appeal.

Members of the victims' families burst into tears when the former coach was declared guilty.

One of the victims told the court he wanted to apologise for not coming forward sooner, the Charlotte Observer reported.

'I could have stopped this from happening,' he said. 'I will not let it happen again. That's one good thing to come out of something so evil.'

Turning to a fellow victim, he added: 'Stand true and proud. We can overcome. You can overcome.'

The three chief witnesses told of how their coach had abused them on many occasions, in hotel rooms, at school, in his apartment and even in their own homes.

One witness described sessions which took place in the his locked bedroom involving different scenarios thought up by Goins, including one for a car race, while the witness had to keep his eyes shut.

The witness said Goins told him to 'grab the throttle' - his finger, but the next time he did it 'it was his penis in my hand.'

The Judge said that Goins had broken trust 'in homes, public schools, taxpayers support and in public property.'

He added: 'The coach kept bringing home the gold.' 

He went on to mention how during the trial 'we’ve heard various officials [at the school] were alerted about problems and nothing was done,' though did not want to pass judgement on the North Carolina school itself.

Goins' lawyer, Brent Ratchford, said he had grown close to the defendant during the trial, and believed he should have been given a sentence of maximum 20 years.

He told the judge how he had 'tried to serve his community', and how he had turned to God in 2008 - a decision which had changed him.

The emotional lawyer told how Goins had said to him: 'God never promised it would be easy'.
