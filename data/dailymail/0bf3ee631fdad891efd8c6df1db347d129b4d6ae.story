Around this time of year most squirrels are busy burying acorns and preparing their nests for a nice long sleep through the winter.

But not these cheeky critters, who have been spotted doing the conga on the branch of a Maple tree.

The three siblings, all from the same nest, were photographed by 50-year-old Robert Ganz in his back garden in Quebec, Canada.

Robert Ganz, 50, a software support technician from Quebec, Canada, spotted these cheeky critters doing the conga on a maple tree in his back garden

The software support technician watched on, camera in hand, as the trio then turned around to face the opposite direction.

After a few more seconds the grey squirrels glanced up at the higher branches before scurrying away after one-another.

Eastern Grey Squirrels are native to Eastern United States, as well as Eastern parts of Canada, including Quebec.

The three siblings, who come from the same nest, formed into a line just in time for Ganz to take pictures

They have been introduced across most of the US and Western Canada now, as well as Europe where they are considered a pest because they compete with native squirrels.

In Britain the Grey Squirrel has almost competed the native Red Squirrel out of existence, and there are now programmes to trap and kill the grey variety to give the reds a chance of surviving.

Despite their name, Grey Squirrels can actually be born with reddish fur, or even completely black.

Sitting 7ft above the ground the trio followed their brother's lead as he suddenly did an about-face

They have large, bushy tales which they use for balance, to keep warm in the winter, as a sun shade and as a means of communication.

While they feed on leaf buds in the spring, with their particular favourite being maple leaves, at this time of year they mostly eat nuts and grains including acorns and beechnuts.

They also use autumn as an opportunity to bury food which they will then dig up in the spring.

The grey squirrels, Quebec's native species, then did some more of the conga facing the other way before scurrying back up into the higher branches

While they do lose some of what they hide, it is a misconception that they are regularly unable to track down their stash, and find about 85 per cent of what they bury using their keen sense of smell.

They also sometimes eat insects, bird eggs and even, occasionally, chicks from a nest.

They are preyed on by foxes, wild cats, owls and hawks. In the wild it is unusual for one to live longer than six years.
