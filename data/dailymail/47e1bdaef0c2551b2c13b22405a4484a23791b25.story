There was nothing Dr Antony Kidman loved more than to spend time with his adoring family. 

The father of Nicole and Antonia Kidman and grandfather of ten – will now be remembered for how he was always there to support his family with his wisdom, kindness and a big smile.

The family is currently in deep shock after the clinical psychologist tragically died on Friday in Singapore, where he was visiting daughter Antonia and her family.

Daddy's girl: Nicole Kidman kissed her happy father Antony Kidman on the red carpet at the Swisse Celebrate Life Ball in Melbourne, in June

The visit was typical of the doting father, who would regularly be pictured with his daughters and their children.

Despite being in his seventies Antony was still happy to travel to wherever his children needed him and on this occasion had been spending time with Antonia, who lives in Singapore with her husband Craig Marran and her six children. 

It had been a very special start to the year for the Kidman family as Antony and Janelle celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.

As an indication of how close they all are to each other, the busy family all came to Sydney from various parts of the world in January to toast the special occasion and this is reportedly the last time they were seen all together.

But the last pictures of Nicole seen publicly with Antony were at the Swisse Celebrate Life Ball in Melbourne, in June this year, when the actress beamed as she walked the red carpet with her two favourite men – her father and husband Keith Urban.

The Hollywood star giggled as she spoke to press whilst pulling her dad close and even broke off from her interview to make a special mention about her dad.

‘Here’s my dad,’ she laughed. ‘I’ve got my men here with me tonight.’

Antony stood quietly listening to Nicole answer questions, smiley widely and looking incredibly proud of his film star daughter.

Daddy’s girl Nicole would regularly take her father along with her to glitzy red carpet events. 

He was always happy to take regularly breaks from his schedule to accompany her to important landmark occasions like the Oscars in 2003 - when she won Best Actress in a Leading Role for The Hours.

Always happy to talk about Antony, Nicole had previously described him as a brilliant dad.

She said: ‘He's a great father, I can call him at three in the morning and he's there for me.

The beauty added that he always supported her career decisions: 'By the time I was a teenager, I had developed skills as a writer, and my father encouraged me to think about a career in journalism.'

A psychologist and Director of the Health Psychology Unit at Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital Antony, who was awarded an Order of Australia in 2005 for his contributions to clinical psychology, clearly instilled a hardworking ethic into his daughters.

She also talked about the way she was brought up adding: ‘My father always used the phrase when we were growing up: 'With love, but firm'.

'Believe me, I grew up with all the rules and guidelines and boundaries. 

'My sister and I were only allowed to watch half an hour of television a day! My parents were always extremely supportive. They allowed me any artistic outlet I wanted.'

She would also often make anecdotal references about him and his cooking skills while she was at school. 

'All the other mums would make these beautiful little sandwiches, but my daddy would just put a slab of butter on top of the bread and then say: 'Whatddaya want-peanut butter?' 

Helping out: Antony, pictured here with Sunday Rose in 2010, would regularly help Nicole and Antonia by looking after their children

'Wouldn't cut it and would't wrap it properly, so by the time you opened it at school it was all stale, and all the kids would tease us.'

Nicole made mention of how active her father was, recalling: 'He ran eight miles at lunchtime, and I used to get terribly embarrassed when the kids at school saw him running, as he'd be all sweaty and look like hell.

'He has brought me up to believe in certain issues, definite values. 

Catching up for lunch: Antony, Janelle, Antonia and her daughter Lucia would regularly spend time together 

'He encouraged me to find time off by myself to meditate every day. He swears by that.'

Just like he was always present for Antonia and Nicole when they were little girls, Antony was also there for them in their adult life.

Both daughters split from their first husbands - Nicole divorced Tom Cruise in 2001 while Antonia also separated from her first husband Angus Hawley in 2007.

It always appeared through pictures taken of him with his girls that he was a stable constant in their lives.
