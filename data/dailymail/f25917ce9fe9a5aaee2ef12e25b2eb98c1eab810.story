Sarah West, the first female commander of a Royal Navy warship, has been sent home after allegedly having an affair with another officer

The first female commander of a Royal Navy warship has been sent home after allegedly having an affair with another officer.

Commander Sarah West, 42, took charge of the frigate HMS Portland in May 2012, but has been sent home from duty after claims she was having a relationship with a male officer on the same ship.

This would breach the Armed Forces’ Code of Social Conduct, which prohibits personnel from having relationships with subordinates if they compromise ‘operational effectiveness’.

While the Royal Navy is investigating the affair, Cdr West, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, retains her position as commander of HMS Portland.

It is not known whether the male officer is married.

Cdr West recently described herself as ‘single’, having been married to a former Royal Navy pilot in 1998. The pair later separated.

A Royal Navy spokesman said last night: ‘We are aware of an allegation of a breach of the Code of Social Conduct on board HMS Portland, which we are treating seriously.

‘Anyone who is found to fall short of the Royal Navy’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action. It would be inappropriate to comment further.’

Earlier this year, Cdr West said work commitments had got in the way of her love life. 

She said in a newspaper interview: ‘I’m really proud to be the first woman but I’m not reinventing the wheel. Lots of women in the services have challenging roles. It’s just that I happen to be newsworthy at the moment.

‘There are drawbacks, though. Years at sea probably explains why I’m single. But every person in the military makes sacrifices.’

She added: ‘I’m a comprehensive-educated northerner who knew nothing about the military as I grew up. I worked as a trainee manager for two years after leaving university – then got bored with the nine-to-five.’

The military’s policy on relationships between servicemen and women is that they are permitted but that they must not undermine ‘trust and cohesion’ or damage ‘operational effectiveness’.

The types of disciplinary action that can be taken when military personnel breach the Code of Social Conduct include formal warning, official censure or the re-assignment of those involved.
