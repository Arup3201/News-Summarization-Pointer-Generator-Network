This heartbreaking video shows the moment a golden retriever desperately tries to revive some stranded fish by splashing them with water.

The video, taken by the dog's owner, shows the hound flicking water at the lifeless fish as they lay on dry land.

The determined dog spends 45 seconds pushing water towards the fish and even nudging one as he tries to bring them back to life, while a woman giggles in the background.

The video shows a dog frantically sweeping water on to a fish as it tries to revive it

Like a fish out of water: The first fish does not move so the golden retriever moves on

Fish's best friend: The dog dashes to a second fish in an attempt to bring it back to life

As the dog becomes more desperate in his attempts to revive one fish, it scrapes its nose along the ground, missing the shallow puddle of water entirely.

The mobile phone video, shot in Thailand, then shows fish's best friend frantically dashing on to another of the large catches.

The dog carries on splashing as its owner laughs more, but the fish still do not move.

However, just as the dog starts to lose hope, one of the fish shows a flicker of life as it opens its mouth and flails slightly.

By this time the golden retriever has already moved onto another fish and does not notice.

A gentle nudge with its nose does not rouse the stranded fish, as a person watching starts laughing

Just after the dog gives up and moves on to the next fish, the second one wriggles slightly and opens its mouth but the caring hound does not notice

One user, Jack Fermon, said: 'That's why I hate people and love dogs...'

Another, under the name Red Magnet, added: 'Dog tries to save fish while humans only take a video and post it on youtube. Sounds about right.'

Cody Graham said: 'Dogs are so much kinder then people are.' 

It's not just in Thailand where dog and fish come face-to-face.

This was the scene near Manchester yesterday when a dog surprised fishermen by emerging from a lake with a carp between its teeth.

The labrador proudly emerged from the lake with the large fish folded between its chops, entertaining a gaggle of fishermen.
