Former radio host Mel Greig has revealed that she is trying for a baby and is freezing her eggs before she loses one of her ovaries.

The 33-year-old DJ, who was behind the royal phone call prank in 2012 which led to the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, is suffering from endometriosis,  a condition that can cause pelvic pain and infertility.

The radio personality, who is married to former footballer Steven Pollock, has opened up about her struggle as part of Endometriosis Awareness month during March.

'I had a bit of a cry when I was told I wasn't going to be able to get pregnant naturally — that was incredibly hard to hear,' Greig, who is a spokesperson from Endometriosis Australia told Adelaide Now. 

'We're going to freeze my eggs and make embryos before my next surgery.' 

'Hopefully, I'll be pregnant by the end of the year — that's the plan.'

The couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Byron Bay on November 20, 2014 in front of just 36 members of their family and friends and then set off on a trip through the US.

Greig is no stranger to crippling illnesses. Just before her nuptials she was hospitalised  with appendicitis.

Endometriosis can be a painful disease for sufferers. There is no known cure and it can take years to be detected.

It causes lesions to grow in a woman's womb, leading to severe pain and inflammation.   

Greig is expected to begin hormone treatment  at the end of the month and undergo surgery to remove the legions in her abdomen.

While she is hoping she will not have to have one of her ovaries removed, her doctors have told her that this is a possibility.     

Greig and her co-host Michael Christian were famously engulfed in a scandal in 2012 after she participated in a radio prank call to the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness.  

They managed to dupe nurse Jacintha Saldanha who transferred their call to another nurse who divulged private information about the Duchess' condition.

Soon after the hoax was publicised, Ms Saldanha committed suicide.

Both Mr Christian and Ms Greig were devastated by the nurse's death, and apologised for making the call.

A court ruling found 2DayFM were in break of their licencing laws by not obtaining the consent of those involved before broadcasting the call 

Ms Greig flew herself to London to make a statement to the court and apologise to Ms Saldanha's family.

ACMA sought to take action against the station for breaching a condition of its licence which stipulates that it would not use its broadcasting service in the commission of an offence.

In March, Australia's High Court ruled that the radio station breached its licence by not obtaining the consent of those involved before broadcasting the call.

2DayFM could also be subjected to 'enforceable undertakings to force future compliance, or further licence conditions.'

In the call, the two announcers phoned London's King Edward VII Hospital pretending to be the Queen and Prince of Wales and seeking information about the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. 

The High Court ruling upholds the finding, which had previously been overturned by the Federal Court, confirming the Authority does have the power to decide whether a criminal offence has been committed for the purpose of determining whether there has been a breach of the Broadcasting Services Act. 

Ms Greig apologised for her role in the incident at Mrs Saldanha's inquest last year, and has spoken of her horror and disgust at the part she played in the prank.
