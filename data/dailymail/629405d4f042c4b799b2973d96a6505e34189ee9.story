The fact that Carlo Ancelotti knows he cannot underestimate Liverpool, that at no price can he or his European champion footballers take the men in red as vanquished, is historically established.

You do remember Istanbul, don’t you? But it wasn’t actually in the Turkish city ‘Carletto’ learned this lesson.

The unwelcome humiliation at the hands of Liverpool did not begin on May 25, 2005 when a three-goal lead for Ancelotti’s Milan was pitifully insufficient.

Ancelotti actually learned about never walking alone, (‘non camminerai mai solo’ in his native tongue or ‘nunca caminarás solo’ as the Spanish say, with reverence) in the Italian capital.

It was more than two decades earlier when the current Real Madrid manager watched, in agony while Liverpool and the cup with the big ears taught him a major lesson.

One which should serve him well this week when the Champions League holders visit Anfield.

It was the 1984 European Cup Final. The Eternal City was the host venue and it was an infernal pity, for AS Roma, that Liverpool became the visitors.

Ancelotti would have been there, in midfield, to greet and then repel them, had it not been for a game against Juventus the previous December.

In what was a 1983 star-studded version of the hostility which is once again dividing Italian football this season, Roma travelled to Juventus.

Ancelotti had, until then, played every single minute of Roma’s European Cup matches, driving them into the quarter-finals.

Juve could boast Michel Platini, future Italy manager Cesare Prandelli and 1982 World Cup winner and top scorer Paolo Rossi, but there were also Marco Tardelli, Gaetano Scirea, Paulo Roberto Falcao, Zbigniew Boniek.

The match’s names trip off the tongue. Roma were champions, Juve wanted the crown back.

Then, bang on the half hour, bang went Ancelotti’s chance of his first ever European Cup Final (although so far there have been seven more as player and manager).

In a collision with his international team-mate, Juve’s Antonio Cabrini, Ancelotti’s left knee collapsed and he was sidelined for months.

And thus he could only watch Liverpool refuse to wilt the following May. Refuse to buckle while Roma’s own Olympic Stadium howled and ranted that this was ‘their’ night, their home ... ‘their very own’ European Cup.

It is ironic that, as Ancelotti watched on helplessly, Bruce Grobbelaar’s wobbly legs and penalty high-jinks distracted Francesco Graziani from scoring and induced him to sky his kick over the top.

Ironic because, 11 years later in Istanbul, Ancelotti was again helpless, the manager on the touchline as Milan wilted and Jerzy Dudek morphed into the modern version of ‘crazy Bruce’, such that Serginho, Andrea Pirlo and Andriy Shevchenko flopped on penalties they would normally score blindfolded and wearing hiking boots.

How Liverpool haunted Ancelotti. ‘They are a team with special connotations for me — some bad memories, some good,’ he said. ‘Twice they beat me when the European Cup was there to be won, that time with Roma when I couldn’t play and then in 2005. But I won the Champions League Final against them in 2007 and my Chelsea side beat them 2-1 at Anfield.

‘Now my goal, Real Madrid’s goal, is to do what nobody else has done.

To win back-to-back Champions Leagues. ‘As a player with Milan, I did it when the competition was the European Cup — we won two in a row. But now this motivates us to set a new mark in the Champions League.

‘Last year there was so much talk about the obsession with ‘La Décima’ (Madrid’ s 10th competition win) — that was our driving force and we achieved it.

‘To win ‘The Eleventh’ is now on everyone’s lips and while it’s a long road, I’ m convinced we are in the mix for the trophy because of the talent in our squad.’

That talent was on show as Cristiano Ronaldo hit a double as Real put five past hosts Levante on Saturday.

In the end, Liverpool is a game about the future for Madrid. The future of ‘La Undécima’ (The Eleventh). But with flavours of the past for Signor Ancelotti.
