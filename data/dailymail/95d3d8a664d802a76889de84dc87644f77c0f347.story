Chris Ashton was deemed surplus to requirements by England during the autumn but the Saracens winger has not given up on his international ambitions.

He started just one Test in 2014 but put his hand up for a recall with a double in the 33-10 win over Munster on Saturday, taking him to 19 tries in 22 European games. 

Asked about his hopes of a Six Nations call-up, Ashton (right) said: ‘I don’t expect anything. 

'I’ve got to fight to get back in. Hopefully Stuart (Lancaster) will recognise my hunger to play for England is as strong as ever. That’ll never change.’

London Irish hooker David Paice will face a disciplinary panel after his red card in the 43-41 win over Grenoble in the Challenge Cup. 

Paice was adjudged to have entered a ruck with his head, but the Exiles held on for their first victory since Brian Smith left. 

Tom Coventry, Smith’s summer replacement, wants Clark Laidlaw, cousin of Greig, to join his coaching team.

The great escape is still on for James Haskell’s Wasps after the England hopeful delivered a tackling masterclass in the 23-3 victory at Harlequins on Saturday night.

Despite losing their first two Pool 2 games, Wasps could secure a home quarter-final if they beat Leinster at home this Saturday.

Wasps are hoping to rekindle their glory days of the last decade and Haskell, who made 28 of his side’s 199 tackles at The Stoop, wants to emulate the achievements of his predecessor, Joe Worsley, whose career was cut short by a neck injury.

‘One of my heroes in rugby is Joe Worsley,’ said Haskell. ‘He would regularly put in 30 tackles a game. He taught me to tackle, so if I can get to that level I am pleased.

‘When I re-signed and came back from New Zealand (in 2012) we nearly got relegated. My knees were gone, I think Dai (Young) thought he had signed a donkey. 

There was lots of change. If we can keep the squad together and keep signing players, then I think we have more to give.’

A deal for All Blacks winger Frank Halai is close to completion, while Sportsmail understands that Scotland international Tim Visser is also on the club’s radar.
