When President George H.W. Bush found out his administration would serve as the inspiration for ABC's fictional political thriller Scandal, he was 'honored,' former Bush cabinet member Andrew Card said on Friday. 

Despite the seedy nature of the show, the former president was flattered by what the show would imply about how physically attractive he is, Card told attendees at a Scandal-themed celebrity breakfast on Friday 
in Washington, D.C.

Despite the seedy nature of the show, former Republican president George H.W. Bush was flattered to learn his administration would loosely serve as the basis for Scandal, former Bush cabinet member Andrew Card told attendees of Politico's Playbook Breakfast Special Celebrity Edition at the Wooly Mammoth Theatre in Washington, D.C. on Friday

Scandal is a television show about a former communications aide to a Republican president with whom the president has an on-going affair. It is based on the life of 
crisis communications professional Judy Smith, who is a co-producer of 
the show.

Unlike her on screen counterpart, Smith did not have an affair with her boss when she served as a special assistant and 
deputy press secretary to Bush.

Card, who worked as Transportation Secretary for Bush, told the audience on Friday that Smith was 'very nervous' about creating a 'climate where Scandal could be embraced.'

While the show 
was under development, Smith called Bush to give him a head ups about 
the show and the subject matter, Card recalled.

'And
 the president says, "I'm so honored," ' Card said.

'So there is a 
degree of I'm gonna say wishful thinking that went with the show as 
well.'

Smith was once asked if she was involved with the president in real life. 'Absolutely not,' she said.

Former
 White House press secretary and the real-life inspiration for press secretary C.J. Cregg in the West Wing Dee Dee Myers said at 
tbig reason people watch the show is because they think this is what 
could be happening in the White House, albeit Scandal is an extreme 
version of that.

'I think people think,
 "There's a lot of crazy stuff that goes on. We need to get behind the 
curtain," ' Myers said during Friday's event, at which she also spoke.

' "Maybe people aren't getting killed all the time, but there's 
all kinds of people having relationships with people, and we know that's
 true because we've read about it from, not just in politics, but across
 major public institutions," ' she continued to tepid laughter from the audience.

Myers was former president Bill Clinton's first press secretary. She was no longer working for White House when  Congress nearly stripped Clinton of his position after he lied about having an affair with then-intern Monica Lewinsky.

During the event Card also spoke about what it was like to serve as chief of staff to a sitting president.

Card, who went on to serve as chief to the second President Bush, indicated that the role is not unlike the position is portrayed in Scandal, minus the killing.

'They end up knowing more than the President, which is scary, but they have to help decide what the President needs to know,' Card said.

The chief of staff doesn't want to waste the President's time with things he doesn't need to know that other members of the government can make, Card said. Other times the chief won't tell the president things to protect him.

On one occasion Card says two cabinet members wanted him to have President Bush call former Enron executive Ken Lay, and he didn't tell the president about it because he thought it was a bad idea.

Lay was later indicted by a grand jury on 11 counts of fraud.

'And the president said, "Thank you!" ' Card recalled.

"Because even if I had told the president, and he didn't make the call, people would want to know, 'What did you talk to the president about?" Card said. 'If he did make the call, and even if he had said, "How you?" and hang up, everybody would have said, "Yeah, sure, you talked about a lot more than that. He was looking for something."

The chief of staff to the President of the United States is not just the gatekeeper of information. He or she is also responsible for sure the presidents other needs are being met so that he can focus on running the country.

After Cosmo editor Joanna Coles commented that Scandal President Fitzgerald Grant always seemed to let his emotions get the best of him when it came time to make tough decisions, Card said one of the most challenging aspects of his job was keeping President Bush optimistic so that he did not poor choices.

' I focused on the president's life every minute of every day,' Card said. 'I never wanted him to be hungry, angry, lonely or tired when he had to make a decision.''I never wanted him walking into the Oval Office saying, "I'm gonna make a bad decision today." '

Friday's event was one of a series of events associated with Saturday evening's annual White House Correspondents Dinner. Card and Myers were joined onstage by Scandal stars Jeff Perry (Cyrus Beene) and Dan Bucatinsky (James Novak), who play the married White House chief of staff and White House press secretary on the show.

Scandal stars Katie Lowes and Guillermo Diaz, who play Quinn and Huck, respectively, also made surprise appearances at the event.
