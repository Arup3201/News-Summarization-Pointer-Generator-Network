He's used to having his fair share of female attention, but few women have had the courage to ask Prince Harry for a dance.

But he wasn't afraid to show off his best moves during his visit to the Fundacion Amigos de Jesus daycare centre in Santiago, which looks after children with mental and physical disabilities.

He is currently on his third day of a Royal tour of Chile, where he flew out to support England football team.

And whilst
 the football team may be enjoying some time off after their World Cup 
exit last Tuesday, Prince Harry has been busy touring the country and 
mingling with adoring fans, children and members of the public.

As
 well as dancing on the steps of the daycare centre, much to the 
amusement of it's patients and onlookers, he played with the children 
and spent time with them throughout the whole day.

He hung out with a young boy called Russel, four, and high-fived the beaming boy as they played in the centre, the Foundation of Friends of Jesus.

He laughed when seven-year-old Pascal Vasquez stole the microphone from him as began to make a speech.

The centre does incredible work with young people who suffer from mental and physical disabilities, though it wasn't just the patients that seemed delighted by the Royal visit.

Staff at the centre looked only too happy to hang out with Prince Harry, too.

This isn't the first time during his trip to Chile that the Prince, who turns 30 in September, has indulged his playful side.

On Friday he visited the 
Sagrada Familia kindergarten school in Chile where he cheered up 
underprivileged children from the Mapuche indigenous community.

But Harry called off his participation in the last event of the day - trail bike riding in the foothills of the Andes

He was said to have canceled his part in the event after coming down with a bug

Instead the Prince watched youngsters riding around close to a river bed and performing wheelies

The prince was said to have been struck down with a 'splitting headache'. He was handed an African pygmy hedgehog named Vlad as he watched the event

He clearly revelled in their company: Harry's face was all smiles and laughter throughout the day, where he played games and musical instruments with the young children, who clearly had the time of their lives as well.

Yesterday he visited to a slum outside the former 
capital, Valparaiso, and showed his practical side by mending the
 family’s television just in time for them to watch the Brazil v Chile 
match in the World Cup.

The Prince was in the village of El 
Vergel, one of the many slums that cling to the hillsides overlooking 
the city, to see how the community is being rebuilt following a forest 
fire in April that destroyed nine in ten of the self-made homes.

He visited various homes of people who suffered during the fires, and even helped one family repair their TV.
