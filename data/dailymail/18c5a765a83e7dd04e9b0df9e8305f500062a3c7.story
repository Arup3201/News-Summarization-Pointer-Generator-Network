Smartphone users will soon be able to surf the web five times faster than on their existing devices with the launch of a super-fast mobile network.

The 4G network, which officially launched yesterday, will be running in 16 cities by Christmas.

It will allow movies and music to be downloaded on to a phone at the sorts of speeds currently only available on a home computer with broadband internet.

But those eager to take advantage will
 have to ditch their current phone and spend hundreds of pounds on one 
of only a few handsets capable of running the network in the UK – and so
 far neither iPhone nor BlackBerry are among them.

Consumer analysts warn that customers 
also face having to commit to expensive long-term pay-monthly deals 
because initially only one UK operator will be offering the faster 
service.

Unlike the current 3G network, which 
can see the internet running at a frustratingly stuttering pace on 
mobile phones, 4G will allow a webpage to download in a quarter of a 
second, and a song to be in just four seconds.

EE, the new brand for Everything Everywhere, is set to launch the UK's first 4G mobile network within weeks, it said today.

Users will also be able to stream – 
watch live from the internet – movies, video clips  and television shows
 as smoothly as on a home computer.

The news comes as Apple launches its 
fifth-generation iPhone in the US today. It is understood the handset 
will not be compatible with the UK’s first 4G network.

BlackBerry also has not yet launched a phone capable of running 4G in the UK.

However, by contrast, Nokia’s Lumia 920, launched last week, offers 4G in Britain.

The first superfast mobile services 
will be operated by the new brand EE, currently known as Everything 
Everywhere, which owns Orange and T-Mobile.

Full services will start in London, 
Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Manchester, 
Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, Nottingham, Derby, Sheffield, Hull and 
Southampton before Christmas. The rest of the country, particularly 
rural areas, will have to wait until next year and beyond.

EE yesterday announced the first handsets available with 4G, but gave no starting date or details of prices.

Rivals, including Vodafone and O2, have been unhappy EE is being allowed to launch 4G before they can offer their own services.

These firms are involved in an auction
 process to buy the airwave frequencies and are unlikely to be up and 
running until the middle of next year.

Consumer analysts fear EE may take advantage of its initial monopoly to impose high charges.

Dominic Baliszewski, of comparison 
website Broadbandchoices.co.uk, warned: ‘Gadget-hungry customers looking
 to upgrade should look before they leap.’
