Crackdown: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith says the new system will stop people 'cheating the system'

Thousands of unemployed benefit claimants will be forced to turn up at job centres for 35 hours a week to prove they are looking for work.

Iain Duncan Smith wants to make sure people claiming jobless benefits are not ‘cheating the system; by secretly working cash-in-hand.

The Work and Pensions Secretary warned that people who fail to turn up to special classrooms in job centres without good reason will lose their benefits.

The latest crackdown comes after Chancellor George Osborne unveiled plans to force people claiming benefits to work for their welfare.

Mr Duncan Smith used his speech at the Tory conference in Manchester to announce two trials forcing people on Jobseekers’ Allowance to spend the working day at jobcenres.

They will have to attend a local centre for 35 hours a week for up to six months, where they will be given expert support and supervision to find work.

Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘We will do everything we can for those who have come through the Work Programme and still don’t have a job.

‘But for those who aren’t doing all they could, or who we think are cheating the system, it is time to make very clear that enough is enough.’

He announced two new pilots for ‘full-time mandatory attendance centres’.

One
 will be targeted at the long-term unemployed at another focuses on 
people who have just started claiming benefits and could be helped by 
the intensive regime.

‘Claimants will attend a local centre 
full-time for up to 6 months, with support and supervision to look for 
work and apply for jobs,’ Mr Duncan Smith will add.

‘No attendance. No benefit. That is only fair.’

Change: Mr Duncan Smith said he wanted to end the 'something for nothing culture'

Ministers expect the pilots to be running by the end of 2014 of next year, working with more than 6,000 people.

They
 think the scheme could have significant impact on moving claimants into
 employment and reinforces the message that inactivity on benefits is 
not an option.

Under the Work Programme, private sector organisations and charities have been tasked with helping the unemployed find a job.

Mr
 Osborne announced the Help to Work scheme, which will force the 
unemployed to do community volunteering from next year if they want to 
claim their benefits.

Those 
who break the rules of the Help to Work scheme, for example by failing 
to turn up for duty without a good reason, could lose their benefit for 
four weeks. A second offence would see them lose it for three months.

New policy: Thousands of unemployed people will be made to turn up to jobcentres 35 hours a week

Today at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, Mr Duncan Smith announced his further measure to get the long-term unemployed back to work.

Speaking in the main hall, he said: 'I want to tell you about those who already showing early signs of not being able to commit to their obligations to work.

'Prior to the Work Programme, we are going to pilot a mandatory attendance centre where selected individuals will receive expert support and supervision while they search and apply for jobs - that is from 9am to 5pm, 35 hours a week for up to six months, simulating the working day.

'These pilots will be targeted at claimants who will benefit from the intensive support, one pilot before the Work Programme and one after the Work Programme.

'Alongside what we have already done with mandatory work programme and our tougher sanctions regime, this marks the end of the something for nothing culture.'
