It's supposed to be the happiest holiday of your life – when you and your loved one have a wonderful time and want to share your good times with friends and family and recently thanks to social media the world at large.

At least that is what a Neapolitan woman thought when she posted photographs of her honeymoon on her Facebook page.

Following a marital row her husband demanded that the photographs be taken down because he had not given his permission and even took his wife to court to force the issue.

Now a Naples court has not only agreed with him but the wife may have to pay him damages.

The pictures were taken on the couple's honeymoon 10 years ago and included photos of the pair cuddling and kissing.

In her defence, the wife's lawyer claimed that 'the use of social networks is now so advanced that we can consider a Facebook wall to be not unlike a private photo album'.

To her horror the court found that the publication of a photo on the internet is 'significantly worse' than any other form of publication because privacy cannot be guaranteed by the user.

The court found that the woman had broken Article 10 of the civil code and 'certainly violated the right to privacy of her husband'. She also fell foul of legislation from 1941 which says that the portrait of a person cannot be displayed, reproduced or sold without the subject's consent.

The decision was welcomed by the husband's lawyer, Ciro Renino, who said: 'It's an unprecedented decision, which will provide a point of reference for Facebook users.'
