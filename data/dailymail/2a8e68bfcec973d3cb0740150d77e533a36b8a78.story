Paul Lambert cleared up accusations that Matthew Lowton had a run in with Aston Villa fans at the end of the clash by claiming he was speaking to his wife.

Lowton was shown exchanging words after Villa’s 2-0 defeat, but the manager claimed he was speaking with his spouse.

The Villa chief said: ‘I have just heard that (about the accusation) but believe it or not his wife was in the crowd and he was telling her to go outside.’

Lambert was furious with his team for their defending and admitted it could take Christian Benteke up to seven games before he is fully up to speed after six months out through injury.

The Villa boss added: ‘The two goals were really poor, but I’m never one for stats because the most important ones are the number of times it is in the back of the net.

‘To come here was always going to be tough. We need to be more clinical,' said Lambert after his side fell to a fifth consecutive defeat and have now failed to score in over 531 minutes of play.

‘They will come out of the taps on Sunday, with Benteke, Weimann and Agbonlahor and Bent there are goals in the team,' added Lambert with his side hosting Tottenham this weekend.

‘Benteke’s injury was really severe and that was only his second game. It is a long time out and he might take six or seven games to get up to speed. There are signs that he is getting there.

Lambert's team had a 65 per cent majority of the possession but failed to make that count which angered the Villa boss: 

‘It is a physical game, we have to try to win a game of football. We didn’t defend well for their goals.

'We can't have as much of the ball as we did tonight and not win the match. Whatever is said in the dressing room stays there. They know my feelings on it and we will regroup and go again on Sunday.'
