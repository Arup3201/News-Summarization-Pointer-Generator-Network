Griff Rhys Jones yesterday led the 
tributes to his long-standing comedy partner Mel Smith, who  died after 
suffering a heart attack.

Smith, his friend of 35 years, was a 
‘brilliant actor’ he said, and his death at the age of 60 had left  
‘everyone in a state of shock’.

Smith died at his home in St John’s Wood, North London, where he lived with his wife of 25 years, Pam.

Paramedics were alerted shortly after
 9am on Friday but London Ambulance Service said he was ‘dead at the 
scene’. Friends said that Smith had suffered a fall at home earlier in 
the week ‘and had been unwell since’.

Others said he been beset by ill health for months and had been ‘in and out of hospital’.

Rhys Jones said yesterday: ‘I still 
can’t believe this has happened. To everybody who ever met him, Mel was a
 force for life. He had a relish for it that seemed utterly 
inexhaustible.

‘He inspired love and utter loyalty 
and he gave it in return. I will look back on the days working with him 
as some of the funniest times that I have ever spent. We probably 
enjoyed ourselves far too much, but we had a rollercoaster of a ride 
along the way.

'Terrific business. Fantastic fun, making shows. Huge 
parties and crazy times. And Mel was always ready to be supportive. 
Nobody could have been easier to work with.’

Sad news: The actor and director Mel Smith has died at the age of 60, his agent Michael Foster has confirmed

The pair found fame in the late 1970s 
in the ground-breaking satirical sketch show Not The Nine O’Clock News. 
But it was Alas Smith And Jones, which lasted for ten series over 16 
years, that guaranteed their place in the comedy firmament.

In later years they set up the 
independent television company, Talkback Productions. Rhys Jones went 
on: ‘We never had an argument about which part we should play or how we 
were going to do something. We never had an argument, in fact. We loved 
performing together. He was a very generous and supportive actor. We had
 a good deal of fun.

‘Mel was not a pressure person. He was
 a gentleman and a scholar, a gambler and a wit. And he was a brilliant 
actor. But he never took himself or the business too seriously. We are 
all in a state of shock. We have lost a very, very dear friend.’

When he moved into the director’s 
chair, Smith’s career flourished further, first with the acclaimed 
romantic comedy The Tall Guy and later the hugely successful Rowan 
Atkinson film, Bean.

Atkinson, who was also in the Not The 
Nine O’Clock News team with Pamela Stephenson, said: ‘Mel Smith – a 
lovely man of whom I saw too little in his later years.

‘He was the cast member with whom I 
felt the most natural performing empathy. He had a wonderfully generous 
and sympathetic presence both on and off screen.

‘He was also an excellent theatre and 
movie director, doing a wonderful job on the first Mr Bean movie. I feel
 truly sad at his parting.’

John Lloyd, producer of Not The Nine 
O’Clock News, said: ‘Mel did an extraordinary thing – he taught us all 
how to make comedy natural.’

Comedy duo: Smith and Jones became famous in Not The Nine O'Clock News together

In 2007, Smith took to the West End 
stage to play Wilbur Turnblad in the hit show Hairspray alongside 
Michael Ball.

Concerns about the multi-millionaire comedian’s health were
 raised four years ago after he appeared on a celebrity version of 
Mastermind looking ‘frail and anxious’ and slurring his words.

He was 
taken to hospital days after the show was recorded and said later: ‘My 
throat specialist feared I had cancer. I spent three weeks in agony in 
hospital. It turned out I had a virulent throat infection.’

In 2000, Smith revealed that he had conquered a seven-year addiction to over-the-counter painkillers.

He said he downed handfuls of the drug
 Nurofen Plus ‘like Smarties’ after developing gout which spread from 
his feet to his wrists, elbows and knees, causing excruciating pain.

‘It was my dark secret and I got deeply depressed,’ he said then.

‘I didn’t dare tell a soul. Like an  
alcoholic hiding his bottles, I started hiding my Nurofen tablets in the
 backs of drawers, behind books on bookshelves and slipped them between 
scripts. It was all terribly grubby.

‘They didn’t make me feel high. They just helped me relax.’

Family: The comedian had been married to former model Pam for 24 years

Shock: Mel, pictured with his wife Pam in 2005, had been battling ill health for some time

On one occasion he swallowed 50 
tablets – more than eight times the recommended daily dose – and had to 
be admitted to hospital.

Tests revealed he had two stomach 
ulcers which had been ‘dripping’ blood, leaving him anaemic.

He said: 
‘When my doctor found out how many pills I’d taken he told me, “You 
might as well of put a gun to your head”. I am very lucky to be alive.’

That realisation finally made him quit the tablets.

At the start of his addiction, Smith 
was also depressed that his career as a director seemed to be stalling, 
despite his film Bean having taken £100 million at the box office.

‘It’s frightening how I became hooked 
on a prescription drug which is freely sold over the counter at any high
 street chemist,’ he said.

The son of a bookmaker, Smith went to 
Oxford before beginning his career as an assistant director at the Royal
 Court Theatre in London, joining Not The Nine O’Clock News in 1979.

BBC Director General Tony Hall said: 
‘Mel Smith’s contribution to British comedy cannot be overstated.

On 
screen he helped to define a new style of comedy from the late 1970s 
that continues to influence people to this day.

His pioneering TV work 
with Griff Rhys Jones through their company Talkback has created many of
 the defining comedy shows of recent decades.’
