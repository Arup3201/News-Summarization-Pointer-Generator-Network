Drivers should be charged more for parking to make them walk instead, health chiefs said yesterday.

New guidelines say going by foot or bicycle should become the norm for short journeys to work, school and the shops. 

Families should even consider selling their car to end the ‘bad habit’ of using it for trips of less than a mile.

It's good for you! Raising parking fees will encourage people to get out of their cars according to NHS advice

The advice from NICE, which sets national standards for healthcare, aims to get Britain fit and reduce disease in later life.

Doctors and nurses are told to set a good example ‘through their own 
behaviour’ and town halls are urged to ‘restrain’ car use with parking 
restrictions and higher fees.

The nanny state initiative was condemned as ‘boneheaded meddling’ by Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance.

‘Things are tough enough for taxpayers already without meddling health bureaucrats trying to make parking more expensive,’ he said last night.

‘For most people using the car is a necessity, not a luxury.

‘Parking charges damage the high street, place an unnecessary burden on struggling businesses and make life even harder for households just trying to make ends meet.

The new initiative has been condemned as 'boneheaded meddling' which could add to the financial woes of already hard-pressed families

‘NICE’s boneheaded attempts to interfere demonstrate how out of touch they are with the pressures faced by hard-pressed families.’

The guidelines do not state by how much councils should push up parking fees, which have already been rising steadily.

Since 2008, fees have more than 
doubled in Doncaster to £1.80 an hour. In Manchester they have gone up 
by 40 per cent over the same period to £2.70 an hour.

This year, Westminster increased its 
charges, which apply on evenings and weekends, by 40p to £4.80 an hour. 
But Harry Rutter, an obesity expert at Oxford University who helped draw
up the guidelines, said action was needed to improve the nation’s 
fitness levels.

‘Only a minority of people in England get enough physical activity to improve their health,’ he added.

‘This creates a huge and often 
difficult burden of illnesses and on people’s quality of life, but most 
people seem unaware of the scale of that burden. We all face barriers in
changing our lifestyle and most of us don’t think we have the time or 
the inclination to add some extra physical activity into our lives.

‘It can be very difficult to break 
old habits and change behaviour. But walking and cycling to work, the 
schools, the shops or elsewhere can make a huge difference.’

Mike Kelly, director of the Centre 
for Public Health Excellence at NICE, said: ‘As a nation, we are not 
physically active enough and this can contribute to a wide range of 
health problems.

‘We want to encourage and enable people to walk and cycle more and weave these forms of travel into everyday life.’

The latest advice from the Department of Health states that adults 
should do at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise five times a week.

But according to the ministry’s own figures, only 29 per cent of women and 39 per cent of men do so.
Lack of exercise is strongly linked to obesity, which in turn causes 
heart disease and strokes and has been linked to several types of 
cancer.

There is also evidence that exercise improves mental health and may stave off depression and even dementia.

It is not the first time that NICE, which stands for the National 
Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, has been criticised for its
public health advice.

In 2010, it produced guidelines saying all five-year-olds should be taught about sex and contraception.

Later that year it urged schools to hold antenatal classes for teenage mothers.

NICE, which also decides which drugs should be used on the NHS, has been accused of banning life-extending cancer treatments.

Its lengthy decision-making process has led to some drugs being held up in the system for up to nine years.
