After years of experiencing prejudice  in the fashion industry simply because she wears a hijab, Muslim designer Frida Deguise has made a public stand against racism at her fashion show.

The 37-year-old Sydney mother-of-four, who was born into a Lebanese family, has been selling and making dresses in Australia for the past 12 years and consistently feels discriminated against due to her cultural attire. 

On Tuesday, while debuting her first ready-to-wear evening clothing line called Roxcii, Frida made her entrance on to the catwalk wearing a controversial T-shirt emblazoned with the logo: 'I'm a fashion threat, not a terror threat,' aimed at silencing her critics.

Frida said she made the fashion statement to show her fellow designers that she 'has a good eye for fashion' and isn't a terror threat just because she wears a hijab.

'I was sick of the pretentiousness within the fashion industry towards Muslim dress designers,' Frida told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I put on that T-shirt because when people see me they always say "so do you make pretty scarves?". Because I'm Muslim, they think all I do is Islamic wear.' 

On the night of her fashion show, one of the designers who was showcasing their collection asked her if she had any strapless gowns in her show, or if all of her dresses were covered up.

The Muslim designer says she is constantly discriminated against due to her clothing and believes she should be judged on her talent 

Her new clothing collection showcases her designs and she says people were shocked that a Muslim woman could design these dresses 

Gobsmacked at the audacity of his question, Frida told him: 'You have to be half-naked to wear my collection'.

Minutes later as her models walked out onto the catwalk showing off her beautiful designs, Frida said he couldn't believe she could actually design and create elegant gowns that show skin and legs.

'You've got to look the part in fashion, you've got to have the body you've got to look good,' she said.  

'One of my teachers from Ultimo introduced me to somebody on the night of the show and he said "This is Frida, she has a collection tonight, she’s a fashion designer, you wouldn't think so would you?".'

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Frida said she made the fashion statement to show her fellow designers that she 'has a good eye for fashion' and isn't a terror threat just because she wears a hijab

Frida admits that the fashion world is tough to crack and says she 'feels attacked all the time' because she does not conform to the conventional image of a fashion designer. 

'I can be funky and edgy but I’m a mother-of-four and I'm overweight,' she said. 

Frida, who is also a stand-up comedian, believes people should respect her for who she is and what she does as opposed to her attire and her religious beliefs.

'When I do stand-up comedy I don’t get it. I used to, I would get it once or twice but in the fashion industry they’re so naive,' she said.

The clothing genius was a chef by trade but always dreamed of opening her own clothing shop

While living in America, Frida won $4,000 on a radio show. 

She immediately rang her mother and told her she wanted to start up her own  Islamic clothing store in Sydney. 

'The new trend at that time was Islamic clothing stores so I came back and I opened one,' she said. 

She went back to school to study pattern making and design

Frida also designs custom gowns for Muslim women 

The shop went bust within a year after a massive flood but Frida was determined to make her plan work and went back to school to learn about pattern making and draping. 

She started to understand what the customer wanted and how exactly a dress was made and has been in a thriving business for the past 12 years. 

Frida has also been designing dresses for the Miss Universe contest for nearly six years. 

However, racial labelling was never far away and one year, while sitting at a table watching the contest, as woman asked her if she had been responsible for the catering at the event.  

'Just because I'm a Muslim she taught I was a caterer,' Frida said.

The designer's evening collection debuted on Tuesday to rave reviews 

Her elegant collection is affordable and  available in nine countries around the world 

'When I told her I did the dresses she said "What are you serious?". They sound like such idiots because they don’t know how to recover.'

Her dresses are now sold in nine countries around the world and she is also a custom designer for Muslim girls looking for someone who is able to create a gown suitable to their culture. 

'I create dresses for a lot of Muslims girls because I know what they want and I know how to cover it and they don’t get embarrassed,' she said. 

'You go to any other store and they will intimidate them. A lot of girls don’t like to go to those places.' 

'When girls come to me they don’t have to explain what needs to be covered. I can put a dress together and know that it follows the Islamic culture.'
