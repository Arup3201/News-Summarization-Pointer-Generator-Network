A baby has overcome a one-in-five-million brain condition – after a blob of medical superglue saved his life.

Just weeks after he was born, Jack Jones was diagnosed with rare condition called Vein of Galen Malformation, and needed life-saving surgery to relieve pressure in his brain.

Surgeons performed a technique to plug a leak in his brain which would have killed him if left untreated, using Histoacryl, a medical form of superglue.

He has now made a full recovery and is back at home with his parents in Merseyside. 

Emma Rigby, 26 and her partner Kelvin Jones, 46, were terrified when their baby Jack Jones, now five months old, was diagnosed with a rare and serious condition called Vein of Galen Malformation

Baby Jack underwent a six hour operation to relieve pressure in his brain. Doctors blocked off a malformed vein using Histoacryl, a medical form of superglue. He is now recovering at home with his parents

Doctors told Jack's parents there was a two-thirds chance he would survive the operation, but he would die without it

Mr Jones (pictured left with baby Jack) and Ms Rigby (pictured right with her son) rushed 200 miles from their home to a hospital in Glasgow, where they were told Jack would need life saving surgery.  Ms Rigby said: 'We had no idea if he was going to make it and I didn't want to leave his side.'

Jack, who is now five months old, was diagnosed in August after a health visitor noticed the circumference of his head was 43.2cm, which is 2cm bigger than an average baby.

His mother Emma Rigby, 26, from  St Helens, Merseyside, said: 'Who knew that measuring Jack's head would save his life.

'He had no other symptoms of the condition, so we're lucky that Louise, the health visitor, spotted it.

'At first, we brushed it off, because he'd always had a big head, but now I'm glad we listened.'

Ms Rigby took Jack to Whiston Hospital in St Helens,  where doctors agreed his head was big but, unconcerned, sent him home.

The next morning, Ms Rigby,who works at a care home, received a phone call from a second doctor asking that they return that day for an ultrasound to rule out anything concerning.

This time doctors found fluid on Jack's brain and realised the situation was serious.

Ms Rigby said: 'The next thing I knew, we were transferred to Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool where Jack had further scans.'

At just six weeks old, Jack was diagnosed with Vein of Galen Malformation, a rare brain condition that only affects 10-12 babies in the UK every year.

The vein of Galen is the brain’s major vein, which drains blood from the brain back to the heart.

Sometimes an abnormal connection between a vein near the vein of Galen and arteries supplying the brain with blood allows blood to flow rapidly from these arteries into the vein of Galen malformation.

The increased pressure means the blood flows faster and at higher pressure than usual.

This leads to the Vein of Galen swelling, which can lead to brain damage.

As the heart needs to work harder to account for this additional blood flow through the vein of Galen malformation, it can also lead to heart failure.

This in turn can cause an increased workload on the lungs, liver or kidneys, which may cause them to fail as well.

The symptoms vary from child to child when they develop symptoms of a VGM.

Some children develop problems soon after birth, while others develop them later in childhood.

Sometimes children do not run into problems until later in life. 

If this is the case, possible symptoms are an enlarged head, seizures (fits or convulsions), or, rarely, bleeding into the brain.

In the UK, between 10 and 12 children are diagnosed with Vein of Galen Malformation each year.

The condition occurs when missing capillaries in the brain increase the blood pressure, meaning the brain has less time to absorb nutrients.

The increased pressure leads to the brain's major vein, the Vein of Galen, swelling, with often devastating results such as heart failure or brain damage.

Shocked, Ms Rigby called her partner Kelvin Jones, 46, who rushed to the hospital.

'We were really panicking,' Ms Rigby said.

''The consultant told me Jack's condition could cause heart failure and said it would have killed him had it gone undiagnosed.

'It was really serious, they were very concerned for his wellbeing.

'I was shocked at the diagnosis. My baby was tiny, he was going through so much and I was thinking the worst.'

For the first-time parents, the next two days were extremely frightening.

The couple were transferred 200 miles to Yorkhill Children's Hospital in Glasgow, so Jack could see international neuro-radiologist Dr Jo Bhattacharya.

Ms Rigby said: 'When we left for Scotland, all I had with me were my pyjamas. 

'At that point, we had no idea if he was going to make it and I didn't want to leave his side.'

The next morning, Dr Bhattacharya explained Jack would need life-saving surgery to decrease pressure in his brain.

Ms Rigby said: 'We were so worked up. Jack only had two-thirds chance of surviving the operation, but he would die without it, so we had no choice.'

During the operation, Dr Bhattacharya blocked off the malformed and swollen Vein Of Galen in Jack's brain by going through a vessel in his groin which led there.

He blocked it off with a blob of glue called Histoacryl, similar to superglue.

The six hour operation was a success and a day later, Jack was back to his normal self.

Now he is back home and is thriving, although he will need check-ups for the rest of his life.

Ms Rigby said: 'We couldn't be happier. Looking at him, you'd think there had never been anything wrong. It feels like a dream.

'We never thought superglue could be used in that way and I'd never heard of such a technique.

'But we just want to thank Louise and Dr Bhattacharya as without them, Jack wouldn't be here. We're so grateful.'

Ms Rigby also praised the NHS for their efficiency and care.

She said: 'Everything was sorted so quickly and the nurses were brilliant, they made us feel at home and even let us sleep in the one of the wards. They cared for and supported us as well as Jack.'

Dr Bhattacharya said the condition is extremely rare, and was surprised that Jack recovered so quickly.

He said: 'In the UK just 10 to 12 babies are diagnosed with the condition every year and usually within the first few hours of being born.

'It's extremely rare and a one in five million condition.

'Jack was diagnosed at six weeks without any symptoms, which is unusual, but his good health otherwise meant he recovered quickly.

'Had Jack's condition not been found, I think his brain would have started to suffer and become progressively damaged, leading to death or very serious brain damage.'
