Liam Fox today becomes the most senior figure to demand Britain joins the US in carrying out bombing raids against Iraqi fanatics.

As David Cameron finally returns from his holidays, the former defence secretary calls on the Prime Minister to sanction the use of our military to protect civilians from 'barbaric' Islamic State fighters.

He attacks the 'catastrophic complacency' of Western politicians over the humanitarian crisis, accusing them of policy paralysis.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox has called on David Cameron to sanction the use of our military against ISIS in Iraq

His intervention came as:

* Downing Street said RAF Chinook helicopters are to be sent into northern Iraq to rescue tens of thousands of Yazidi refugees;

* British planes are also expected to take military supplies to help Kurdish fighters tackle the Islamic State militants;

* A rescue helicopter crashed because it was carrying too many refugees;

* A senior general accused the Government of being too terrified to intervene.

Resisting strong pressure to recall Parliament, the Government said last night there were no plans to make the British operation in Iraq more than a humanitarian mission.

However, writing in the Daily Mail today, Dr Fox says this approach is unsustainable – and that aid on its own is not enough to help defenceless Iraqis. Instead of leadership, he says there has been a vacuum that has allowed Islamic State to press ahead with a campaign of mass slaughter.

And he warns that unless the maniacs are vanquished, young jihadis could flood to Britain to bring death and mayhem to our shores. In his hard-hitting article, the former minister calls on Mr Cameron to send the RAF to join US jets in blitzing Islamic State fighters – and says we should also supply arms to Kurdish fighters.

If RAF Chinook helicopters fly into action in Iraq – even on a humanitarian mission – it represents a considerable upping of the stakes.

The heavy-duty twin-rotor aircraft can transport tons of aid and airlift out dozens of refugees but not without significant risk. Their advantage over high-flying cargo planes is that they can land, but this makes them vulnerable to attack.

Crews would also face having to fend off hundreds of desperate refugees threatening to overload the helicopter, as has been happening with Iraqi Army aircraft this week.

The use of Chinooks would also raise the prospect of British forces effectively becoming involved in combat, given that they might have to defend themselves against an attack by IS fanatics who would relish the chance of downing a British helicopter.

As the spectre of 'mission creep' was raised again yesterday, three RAF Tornado warplanes jetted from RAF Marham in Norfolk for Cyprus, from where they will fly sorties over Iraq.

Between six and eight Tornados will be equipped with reconnaissance pods used to scan the landscape distinguishing friend from foe, to identity where humanitarian supplies should be dropped.

Mr Cameron, who has faced criticism for remaining on holiday in Portugal as the crisis unfolded, returns from his holiday later today and will be back at his desk at Downing Street tomorrow.

The government has faced growing criticism over its apparent lack of a coherent strategy on how Britain is to respond to the Iraq crisis.

One of the country's most senior generals yesterday accused the 'commitment-phobic' Government of being 'terrified' of intervening in the Iraq crisis before next year's general election.

General Sir Richard Shirreff told the Times: 'The longer we sit on our hands and prevaricate, the more dangerous the situation is going to become.'

Yesterday both Tory MP Conor Burns and Labour's Gisela Stewart wrote to the Prime Minister to demand he recall Parliament to discuss possible UK action in Iraq.In his letter to Downing Street, Mr Burns said stronger action was needed against Islamic State because 'these people want a holocaust of everyone who does not share their brutal ideology'.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said 'it would be in the interests of the Government' to have Parliament recalled.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond again dismissed calls for military assistance yesterday.

A Number 10 spokesman said: 'As part of our efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Iraq, we are sending a small number of Chinook helicopters to the region for use if we decide we need further humanitarian relief options.

'We have also agreed to transport from other contributing states some critical military re-supplies for the Kurdish forces, so that they can provide effective protection from ISIS for the huge number of refugees now in Iraqi Kurdistan, and humanitarian operations.'

Dr Foxwarns a fundamentalist caliphate would be a magnet for jihadists around the world

ISIS are BRITAIN'S enemy and have to be defeated

by LIAM FOX, former Tory Defence Secretary

For months, we have watched ISIS tighten their grip on the territory and people they control.

They are well funded and well organised, strengthened by the chaos of the civil war in Syria and the actions of the disastrous Maliki government in Iraq.

They are one of the most barbaric and savage forces we have witnessed in the world since the genocide in Rwanda.

They pose a direct threat to the lives of civ- ilians who oppose their hardline religious views, they destabilise further an already volatile region and they will increasingly create young jihadists who will find their way to countries like our own.

The idea that this is not our problem is wishful thinking at best, and cata-strophic complacency at worst. Yet, in the face of all the evidence, there has been policy paralysis in the West. Where we have needed leadership we have found a vacuum.

Certainly, public opinion is split over any military action, understandable after the protracted conflict in Iraq, but this is an occasion where we need to lead public opinion, not follow it.

The consequences of allowing an extremist caliphate to be formed, stretching from Syria to the borders of Iran, are almost unthinkable.

Not only would it bring further horrors to innocent people, the likes of which we have seen graphically in the last few weeks, but it would potentially risk a full-scale Sunni-Shia conflict with profound economic consequences for us all.

Those who say we should have nothing to do with the conflicts in the region might want to think about the effect on oil prices in the event of a clash involving Iran or Saudi Arabia.

If the global economy were to suffer another oil shock, the price, for the poorest countries in particular, could be disastrously high.

Perhaps worst of all, a fundamentalist caliphate would be a magnet for jihadists around the world and it would soon be used as a base from which to export terrorism and extremism.

So, we need to be clear, ISIS are our enemy and need to be defeated.

Either we use our military power to degrade and diminish their military capabilities, so that the countries in the region are able to deal with them effectively, or we can ensure that we supply our allies in the region with the equipment and knowledge they need to do the job themselves.

In all likelihood, we will have to do both. A half-hearted and ineffectual intervention will only increase the suffering of those caught up in the nightmare of ISIS and increase the risk of a widening crisis.

The US government has made a belated, but welcome, decision to use American air power to hit ISIS bases.

We should be willing to do the same if asked. Sending humanitarian aid is right but if we are leaving the vulnerable unprotected from the military terror of the ISIS forces then our help is superficial.

There are, of course, risks involved with any outside intervention, but those who think that we will be left alone by the fanatics if we are not seen to be taking a side are fooling themselves.

In the West, we need to understand that Islamist fundamentalists hate us, not just because of what we do, but because of who we are.

Our systems of law and government and our concept of rights, especially women’s rights, and religious tolerance undermine their very existence in the long-term.

There is not going to be a cost-free option available in a situation which has already been allowed to continue for too long, but the cost of failing to act could be higher still.
