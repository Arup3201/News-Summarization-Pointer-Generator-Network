Holidaymakers watched in horror yesterday as five crewmen were killed in an accident on a luxury Thomson cruise liner.

During a stopover for a festival in the Canary Islands, eight crew were checking a lifeboat when its ropes snapped and it suddenly plunged 65ft from the upper deck into the sea.

The lifeboat is said to have overturned as it hit the water, trapping most of them underneath.

Three were taken to hospital, but five
 crewmen – three Indonesians, a Filipino and a Ghanaian – drowned as 
shipmates desperately fought to rescue them.

Last night, Thomson Cruises said it 
was investigating the accident aboard the Thomson Majesty, which only 
made its first sailing for the firm last summer.

The luxury ship, which carries 1,462 
passengers and has 17 spa rooms, two swimming pools and five 
restaurants, had arrived at Santa Cruz on the island of La Palma three 
hours earlier for a six-hour stop en route to Madeira.

At just before midday, with many 
passengers on shore enjoying carnival celebrations, the crew began to 
lower the lifeboat as part of a drill that was made compulsory for 
cruise liners at every stop following the Costa Concordia tragedy.

But witnesses said that during the 
safety exercise, one of the lifeboat hoist cables snapped, briefly 
causing the boat to hang vertically with the eight crew on board.

Seconds later, the other cable snapped under the strain, sending the boat plummeting six decks towards the water.

Rescue workers: The five people killed were crew of the Thompson Majesty, operated by Thomson Cruises

Concern: The local harbourmaster said the early indications were that the lifeboat had plunged into the water after a mechanical failure

The Thomson Majesty - a nine-deck boat measuring 679ft by 92ft with a speed of 19 knots - has five restaurants, five bars, two lounges, a casino, two swimming pools, a library and fitness centre. It
 can carry up to 1,462 passengers along with 600 staff.

A
 seven-night cruise of the Canary Islands on the boat, leaving in 
February or March, costs £600 per person for a two-person cabin online, including return flights from London to Tenerife.

The survivors, two aged 30 and one 
aged 32, managed to jump away before it hit the water. Two, both Greeks,
 are said to be seriously injured and are being treated at a local 
hospital. The third, a Filipino, has been discharged.

The others were trapped as they 
entered the water. Four of them were dead by the time their bodies were 
recovered, while the other crewman died a short time later.

Last night, the small, white, 
two-hulled lifeboat could be seen capsized beside the ship. The Foreign 
Office said it was ‘urgently investigating’ the incident.

Last night a former passenger raised doubts about the safety drill.

Retired entrepreneur Terry Dobbins, 75, from Bournemouth, was on the ship last week and watched the ‘shambolic’ safety exercise.

He added: ‘The lifeboat was coming 
half way down, then lurching to a halt. They were bouncing in mid air. 
The winches were seizing up. It was really worrying.

‘I’m not sure if I would go back. Our lives are in their hands.’

The 40,876-ton Majesty, which has a 
crew of 600, sails around the Greek islands in the summer before taking 
passengers on winter sun cruises to the Canaries, Madeira, Morocco and 
Tenerife. The 20-year-old ship is managed on Thomson’s behalf by a 
company called Louis Cruises.

It is the second tragedy to strike the
 ship since it entered service in 1992. In March 2010, two passengers 
were killed when the liner, then called the Louis Majesty, was struck by
 a giant wave in the Mediterranean.

Last night Thomson said: ‘There was an
 incident involving the ship’s crew during a safety drill. Our thoughts 
are with the families of those involved.

‘We are working closely with the ship owners and managers, Louis Cruises, to determine exactly what has happened.

‘We are also working closely with all relevant authorities and will be co-operating fully with their investigations.’
