Fashion label Valentino has been slammed by industry insiders for featuring photographer Terry Richardson in its latest campaign, despite the series of shocking allegations of sexual assault that have been made against him by more than a dozen models. 

It is the fourth time that the 49-year-old has appeared in a Valentino ad, having helped to showcase the brand's accessories collections for the past three seasons.

And while his face is not featured in the campaigns - just his arms and legs, which are easily identified by his distinctive tattoos - many critics have been left horrified that the brand has continued to show its support for Richardson and his work.

'Very questionable': Valentino's latest campaign is the fourth to feature Richardson's distinctively tattooed arms

'At this stage it seems [Valentino is] actively trying on bank on [Richardson's] very questionable brand of edginess,' Styleite writer Hannah Ongley explained. 

'Personally, as part of the younger crowd they’re trying to tap into, I prefer rape vibes as a removable feature rather than inextricably connected to the product.'

Style Blazer's Nicole Brown added: 'While [Bill] Cosby's nearly 50 plus year career and clean cut image has been destroyed in under 2 weeks, [Terry Richardson] has continued to work within his industry, despite the public confession of several models who to have been taken advantage of.

'This marks [Valentino's] third time collaborating [with him] and although the photos are aesthetically pleasing, we can’t help but wonder if the truth behind the Richardson claims will ever come out.'

According to Vox.com,the first allegations made against Richardson came to light in 2005, when he faced two lawsuits from models accusing him of sexual assault. He settled both cases out of court. 

Since then, dozens of models have come forward to accuse the photographer of abusing his role and taking advantage of young women and men while working with them. 

In October last year, a young woman from London started an online campaign calling for brands to cut ties with the photographer once and for all. 

'More awareness needs to be brought to light that Terry Richardson is negatively influencing media with his supposed exploit & abuse of certain models, mainstream degrading pornographic imagery, and inappropriate and unprofessional behavior,' Londoner Alice Louise wrote on her petition.

Considerate and respectful? The 49-year-old has continued to deny all allegations made against him

'WHY if we are aware of these allegations are big companies STILL using Terry Richardson as a photographer and still giving him positive press if he is an ALLEGED sex offender? 

'These allegations need to be looked at more closely and the appropriate justice received. They should not be ignored. By continuing to employ him for editorial fashion shoots, or to run advertising campaigns shot by him is to CONDONE his behavior.' 

And while Valentino has continued to show support for the photographer, both Vogue and H&M have publicly distanced themselves from Richardson, with a Vogue spokesperson confirming in April that the magazine has no plans to work with him again.

In a statement made to US Weekly, the publication said: 'The last assignment Terry Richardson had for US Vogue appeared in the July 2010 issue and we have no plans to work with him in the future.' 

Richardson has continued to deny the allegations made against him, writing on his blog: 'I just want to take a moment to say I’m really hurt by the recent and false allegations of insensitivity and misconduct. 

'I've always been considerate and respectful of the people I photograph and I view what I do as a real collaboration between myself and the people in front of the camera.'
