A mother-of-three is making her circus debut tonight after mastering her impressive hula hoop act in her back garden.

Lisa Sampson, 34, from Upper Beeding in West Sussex, couldn't even touch her toes when she took her three children to a circus workshop in 2012 in an attempt to encourage 
them to take up an act.

But she ended up coming away with a love of hula hooping and has been hard at it in her garden it for two hours a day ever since.

The former hairdresser is now so skilled that she has now set up her own hula-hoop classes.

Lisa said: 'I saw this person perform and I just thought 'I really want to do that, it looks so cool'. That's where the inspiration came from.

'So I bought my daughter a hoop for her to practice with and ended up using it myself.

'Unfortunately I broke that one so I bought another one - then when I got really good I started making my own and trying and learning more and more new tricks.

'I bought DVDs and watched YouTube videos to teach myself new tricks.

'My kids have never taken it up - Damon is into stilt walking and often walks on them to school but otherwise none of them followed up the workshop.'

Lisa's children, Shaquille, 15, 
Mya, 12, and Damon, eight, and husband of five years Neil Sampson, 40, who works in IT, are all 100 per cent behind her new passion in life.

They will all be in attendance in the audience tonight in Shoreham, West Sussex, where Lisa will be spinning more than 30 hoops around her body during her three-minute act at Circus Wonderland, which is on until Sunday.

She added: 'They all thought it was really funny to watch me at first in the garden because I couldn't keep the hoop up.

'So I thought 'I will do this' and now they absolutely love it.

'Quite often when they have their mates round they ask me to perform my new tricks for them so I like to think they're big fans of what I do.

'I never had an interest in the circus at all until I went to this workshop and visited the circus I'm now performing at last year.

'I went a couple of times in my childhood but I barely remember it but now I'm obsessed - I went to see the Cirque Du Soleil recently in London and it was amazing.'

She said: 'They always ask me 'Why do you never show anyone what you can do?'

'I'm quite nervous about performing at the show but I might as well go for it - it's all I want to do now.'
