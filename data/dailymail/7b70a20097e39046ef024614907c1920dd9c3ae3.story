Stoke are interested in Bolton's Lee Chung-Yong who is recovering from a hairline fracture of his leg. 

But Fiorentina are also eyeing a swoop as they look at alternatives to replace Chelsea target Juan Cuadrado.

Cuadrado starred for Colombia during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and the playmaker's arrival could signal Stamford Bridge departures for Andre Schurrle and Mohamad Salah.

Bolton's Lee has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs lately but Stoke could be the first to instigate a move for the South Korea international. 

Lee is out of contract at Bolton at the end of the summer and Neil Lennon may decide to cash in on him now.

Bolton are 16th in the Championship and held Liverpool to a 0-0 draw in the FA Cup fourth round at the weekend.
