The war of the Christmas adverts is always fierce and this year has been no exception.

Thus far there has been animated woodland creatures, a magical and celebrity-filled Wizard of Oz adventure and a moving glimpse into real households’ celebrations.

Now iconic department store Harvey Nichols have thrown their festive hat into the ring with a tongue-in-cheek advert urging shoppers not to spend money on gifts, but instead to treat themselves.

Harvey Nichols has made a tongue-in-cheek advert urging shoppers to spend money on themselves

The advert sees family members 
eagerly unwrapping gifts under the tree only to find that beneath the 
enticing paper lies not an expensive treasure but one of Harvey Nichols'
 ‘Sorry I Spent It On Myself’ gifts.

The
 'Sorry, I Spent It On Myself' collection comprises a range of ‘Ultra 
Low Net Worth’ (ULNW) gifts for those customers who understand that a 
little something for their nearest and dearest means a bigger something 
for themselves.

'What is it?' 'It's a sink plug': The advert sees family members eagerly unwrapping gifts to find that beneath the paper lies not an expensive treasure but one of Harvey Nichols 'sorry I spent it on myself' gifts

Non-Swiss Biro Pen, 81p

Christmas Lunch in a Tin (with most of the trimmings), £1.89

And we all 
know nothing quite says Merry Christmas like a packet of Authentic 
Lincolnshire Gravel, real wood toothpicks, or a sink plug (water 
resistant).

The full Harvey Nichols budget range, which will be available in stores and online from Wednesday 27 November also includes Christmas dinner in a can with nearly all the trimmings, £1.89, a genuine wire sponge, 96p, a non-Swiss biro pen, 81p, and of the elastic band gift set, £1.

The advert captures a series of self-indulgent individuals who understand the joys of gifting number one. After all, it’s the thought that counts……..isn’t it? 

'I have two!' A grandma is ecstatic as she rattles her presents given to her by her grandson

'It's paper clips...' Scene by scene we begin to discover that in each case the suspiciously well-dressed gift-giver appears to have spent rather more time and money on themselves

In
 one scene, surrounding the Christmas tree, it’s 'Alicia’s' turn to share 
the Christmas cheer; adorned in gold brocade trousers by Kenzo and a 
shiny new pair of Louboutin ‘Pigalle’ Leather Pumps, she nonchalantly 
presents her dad with… an elastic band gift set.

‘It’s their new collection…’ she murmurs in justification to the disapproving looks.
