Original texts: The first ever editions of the Brothers Grimm, released in 1812, reveals a far darker side to children's stories known around the world  

'Here's a knife... if the slipper is still too tight for you, then cut off a piece of your foot. It will hurt a bit. But what does that matter.'

If you ever had Cinderella read to you as a child, you probably won't be familiar with this extract - where the stepsisters are urged by their mother to self-mutilate in a bid to marry the prince.

Incidentally, he then noticed the blood sloshing around in the 'golden' slipper, thus thwarting their ugly scheming.

If you're not familiar with this grimmer version of the Brothers Grimm tale, you're not alone - as it comes from the first-ever English translation of their original edition, which was released in 1812.

And it's not just Cinderella which was wholly unsuitable bedtime reading for children: Rapunzel becomes pregnant after having a 'merry time' with her prince in the tower - and it's Snow White's real, not step, mother who orders the huntsman to 'stab her to death'.

Elsewhere it's Hansel and Gretel's biological mother who abandons them in the forest because she can't afford to feed them. 

When Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, from Hanau, Germany, published the first version of the now classic collection, then called Children's And Household Tales, they had no idea the 86 stories would reach such a wide audience.

A second volume of 70 tales followed in 1815 - and another six editions over the next 40 years, each one revised and, crucially, more and more child-friendly.

In the process, some of the most unsavoury ones were left out, such as How The Children Played At Slaughtering - in which one boy cuts the throat of his little brother while playing butcher and pig.

Another later omitted was Children Of The Famine, where a mother threatens to kill her daughters since there is nothing left to eat. 

Jack Zipes, professor emeritus of German and comparative literature at the University of Minnesota, decided to go back to the Grimms' roots out of curiosity and translate the first two editions (all 156 tales) which was published last month as The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: The Complete First Edition.

He believes that the pair changed the stories in the later editions because they 'held motherhood sacred'.

Changes: In the first two editions of the Grimm tales, Rapunzel becomes pregnant after having a 'merry time' with her prince in the tower while in Hansel and Gretel it's their biological mother who abandons them in the forest because she can't afford to feed them

According to The Guardian, he speculates that the Grimms' changes were 'reflecting sociologically a condition that existed during their lifetime - jealousy between a young stepmother and stepdaughter as 'many women died from childbirth in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and there were numerous instances in which the father remarried a young woman, perhaps close in age to the father's eldest daughter.'

The academic, who took 18 months to translate the text, told the paper that the changes made were 'immense', suggesting the original tales were not published with children in mind, with up to 50 tales heavily edited or deleted for later editions.

For example Zipes believes Wilhelm Grimm got rid of the tales that would a 'religious middle-class sensitivity'. 

In the introduction to the book, he writes: 'All these editorial changes to the tales in the first edition of 1812/15 should not lead us to believe that the tales were crude, needed improvement, and do not deserve our attention.

'Moreover, the Grimms had not yet 'vaccinated' or censored them with their sentimental Christianity and puritanical ideology. In fact, the Brothers endeavoured to keep their hands off the tales, so to speak, and reproduce them more or less as they heard them or received them.

'That is, the tales were not their own in the first place. Though they gradually made them their own, these stories retained other voices and still do. They originated through the storytelling of various friends and anonymous sources and were often taken from print materials.'

Zipes adds: 'These first-edition Grimms' tales have a beguiling honesty and an unusual perspective on human behaviour and culture.'

Gruesome: In the original Cinderella, her stepsisters try to cut off part of their feet with a knife so they can fit into the slipper 

Authors: Jack Zipes said the Grimm brothers (pictured together right and left) changed the stories in the later editions because they 'held motherhood sacred'

Not aimed at children: Snow White's real, not step, mother orders the huntsman to 'stab her to death'

Twist to the story: As evidence of her death, the mother asks the huntsman to bring back her lungs and liver as proof that she has been killed 

'[The 1812 edition] was not published for children or general readers... It was only after the Grimms published two editions primarily for adults that they changed their attitude and decided to produce a shorter edition for middle-class families. This led to [the] editing and censoring many of the tales,' he told The Guardian.

Some stories were later omitted, not due to their gruesome quality, but their heritage: for example, Bluebeard and Puss In Boots were not reprinted because of their French origin.  

The new book, published by Princeton University Press, offers a fascinating insight into how the collection has changed with the times.

Professor Zipes pointed out that around 50 stories in the first edition were either deleted or radically revised by the seventh edition in 1857, considered as the standard version even today.
