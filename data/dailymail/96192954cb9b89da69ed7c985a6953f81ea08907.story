The specially-engineered skinsuits made for the U.S. speedskating team have been dropped after being blamed for the team's poor performance during the first week of the Winter Olympics.

The Under Armour suits, made specifically for each member of the team, will be dropped and the team will return to their old kit after complaining that the design was ruining their medal chances.

No U.S. skater has finished higher than seventh in six of the 12 Olympic events so far in Sochi, despite the speedskaters dominating competitions in the run up to the Games.

The International Olympic Committee has agreed to allow the Americans to switch to their old kit, as long as it had been approved at the start of the season.

Under Olympic rules every member of the team must be wearing the same type of kit.

Skaters had complained that vents on the backs of the suits were letting air in, which was affecting their performance.

The high-tech suits, developed in relation with aerospace and
 defense giant Lockheed Martin, were touted as the 'fastest speedskating
 suit in the world'.

Because they were only recently completed, the team didn't get to try the Mach 39 suits in the competitive arena until the start of the Games.

U.S. Speedskating executive director Ted Morris told the Wall Street Journal the team had been divided about the suits.

'The
 general feeling from the athletes, it's pretty darn close to 50-50,' 
Morris said on Friday, one day before the team agreed to switch back to 
the old outfits.

The new ones had been exclusively 
designed for the U.S. team. Under Armour scientists had visited their training facility in Salt Lake City and used a 3D image scanner to
 capture highly accurate digital measurements of the athletes from every
 angle.

The final design featured strategically-placed polyurethane strips on the forearms, calves and forehead to reduce drag by breaking up the airflow, just like the dimples on a golf ball. 

On the inside of the thighs, patches of ArmourGlide are said to reduce friction by 65 percent.

Among the U.S. athletes to under-perform is female star Heather Richardson, who has admitted to making alterations to her suit.

'They
 did adjust one part on the back, but it was just putting rubber over 
the mesh there,' she said after a hugely disappointing performance in 
the 1,000, a race she dominated during the World Cup season.'It had no 
effect, really.'

Similarly, Shani Davis was a two-time Olympic champion in the men's 1,000 and looking to become the first male speedskater to win the same event at three straight games.

His eighth-place showing Wednesday was the first indication that something might be seriously wrong with the U.S. team's preparation.

'I'm honestly being as optimistic as I can possibly be,' he said. 'I'm
 just staying focused on the 1,500-meter race. Suit or no suit, I've got
 to go out there and try to win. That's what I'm going to do.'

Despite the switch, both the coaches and Under Armour have defended the suits and what they are capable of.

'The
 evidence does not  suggest that the suits have contributed to the 
disappointing results to date,' USA Speed Skating Executive Director Ted
 Morris said in a statement that was emailed to CBS News.

'However, there are many factors that determine Olympic success and we are constantly making adjustments to improve results.'

Under Armour also provided a statement from Kevin Haley, the Senior Vice President of Innovation.

'While a multitude of factors ultimately determine on-ice success, many skaters have posted personal-best sea-level heat times, split times or race times this week, and we're rooting for that to translate into medals over these next couple of days,' he said.

Coach Kip Carpenter had scoffed at the notion that the suits are the only reason for the American struggles.

'The human factor is by far the largest piece out there,' he said. 'There's not an athlete out there who is slowing down a second per lap because of the suit they're in.

'Anyone who thinks that doesn't know speed skating. What is it: a parachute on their back? There are guys out there in low-technology suits.

'The Germans are out there ... in mostly Lycra suits with some rubber, and they're wiping us all over the place.'

American skater Joey Mantia, who finished 15th in the 1,000m and who will also race in the 1,500m with Davis, said the disappointing results had soured the mood in the camp with six events remaining.

'We are all a little down right now,' said the former inline skater. 'We could make a list of everything that's wrong, it could be the suits, could be the food, we don't know.'
