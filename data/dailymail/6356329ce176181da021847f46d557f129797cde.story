Nancy Snyderman's actions caused a local maid to get fired due to Ebola fears in the town

NBC chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman caused a local maid to be fired when she violated a voluntary Ebola quarantine agreement.

The maid, known only as Vilma, was turned away by two of her employers after Dr Snyderman visited her favorite New Jersey soup restaurant last week.

Vilma's brother is the chef at The Peasant Grill, near Princeton, and people in the town were concerned that the woman could have been exposed to the deadly virus.

They panicked because  one of the members of the quarantined NBC crew went into the restaurant and they feared the chef may have then exposed his sister to the disease, TMZ reported.

Two homeowners who had been using Vilma for years told her she could not work with them until further notice.

Dr Syderman, 62, was one of seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days after the station's cameraman Ashoka Mukpo tested positive for Ebola while working in Liberia.

But witnesses said that the physician and broadcaster wore sunglasses with her hair in a ponytail as she pulled up in her Mercedes outside the soup restaurant.

Shortly after the alleged trip to the dining spot, the New Jersey Department of Health forced Dr Snyderman and her crew into mandatory quarantine.

Local health officials say they investigated and there is no risk that anyone who was in the restaurant could have contracted Ebola during the incident.

However, it seems that not everyone believes this.

According to the National Review Online, neighbors say that the previously well-reviewed Peasant Grill restaurant now appears to be quite empty.

The maid's brother was a chef at The Peasant Grill restaurant - where Dr Snyderman visited last week in breach of her Voluntary Ebola quarantine agreement 

It has also suffered a few questionable reviews. 

'Please understand that people who have recently returned from Africa and were quarantined for Ebola, broke thier [sic] quarantine order and went to this establishment to pick up food,' one person wrote on Google Reviews.

'This is very serious, there is no hard facts about how Ebola is transmitted, it is such a serious, virulent virus. Be careful, don't go to this restaurant anytime soon. They should, out of an abundance of caution, close thier [sic] doors for a reasonable period of time and sue Dr Nancy Snyderman.'

But at Yelp Reviews, users are still rating the restaurant five stars - even if they are making a bit of a joke about it.

Dr Snyderman has not accepted personal responsibility for the violation, but shifted the blame onto her team

'I know everyone is raving about their ebolas of soup – and I love them as much as the next guy, but not sure if I would die for them,' one person wrote.

Dr Snyderman has not yet accepted personal responsibility for the violation, instead shifting the blame onto  the whole team.

In an apologetic statement read out on NBC on Monday, she said: 'While under voluntary quarantine guidelines, which called for our team to avoid public contact for 21 days, members of our group violated those guidelines and understand that our quarantine is now mandatory until 21 days have passed. 

'We remain healthy and our temperatures are normal.

'As a health professional I know that we have no symptoms and pose no risk to the public, but I am deeply sorry for the concerns this episode caused.' 

Nancy Snyderman, pictured while covering the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, was one of seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days  as doctors treat the station's cameraman Ashoka Mukpo for the virus

The group was reporting on the Ebola outbreak for NBC News in Liberia when Mukpo, their freelance cameraman, was diagnosed with the virus just a day after he was hired to work for the team. 

Mukpo's family said last week that he believed he had contracted Ebola when he was washing down a vehicle that had transported bodies that perished from the disease. Ebola is transmitted through contact with blood and body fluids.

The cameraman was infected in West Africa but is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha after being flown in on a specially-altered flight with an isolation chamber.

The 33-year-old has received an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001, and a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly, who beat Ebola. 

An NBC spokesman said on Monday that the network could not comment on any individual case, but noted that the team was deemed to be low-risk upon its return from Liberia.

He added that they had agreed to follow the guidelines set by local health authorities which included the 21-day isolation period.

He said: 'We fully support those guidelines and continue to expect that they be followed.

'Our team are all well with normal temperatures, which they check multiple times a day, and they are also in daily contact with local health officials.'

Meanwhile, in a phone interview with the Today show last week, Dr Snyderman said all the gear she and her crew used was being disinfected because they all shared work space and vehicles.

She also said that she believed she and her team were at a low risk because they have been 'hyper-vigilant'.

Hospitals across the U.S. remain on high alert over the outbreak of Ebola.

Yesterday a second healthcare worker in Texas was diagnosed with Ebola after treating U.S. 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan.

Nurse Amber Jay Vinson, 29, originally from Akron, Ohio, is 'ill but clinically stable' after reporting a fever at Texas Presbyterian in Dallas.

Another nurse, Nina Pham, 26, was also being treated for Ebola after becoming infected with the disease while caring for Mr Duncan at Texas  Presbyterian.

Miss Pham, a Texas Christian University nursing school graduate, is in isolation at the same hospital. 

Her condition improved after receiving a blood transfusion from Ebola-survivor Dr Kent Brantly.
