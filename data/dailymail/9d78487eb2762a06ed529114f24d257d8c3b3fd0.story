Corinthian-Casuals won 3-0 against Ramsgate  in front of 127 supporters on Saturday.

But in January, the non-League club will take on Brazilian outfit Corinthians at a stadium built for the 2014 World Cup that holds almost 48,000 fans.

The friendly at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo will mark 100 years since a scheduled match between the two teams was abandoned due to the outbreak of the First World War.

June 23, Holland 2-0 Chile

June 26, South Korea 0-1 Belgium

July 1, Argentina 1-0 Switzerland (LAST 16)

July 9, Argentina 0-0 (4-2p) Holland (SF) 

Both clubs have a history that dates back to 1910, when the English amateur side toured Brazil and locals were inspired to create their own Corinthians team as a result.

Casuals sit 11th in the Ryman Isthmian League South, the eighth tier of England's footballing pyramid, and will travel for the fixture against the team currently fifth in Brasileirao on January 25.

The non-League side are making a documentary about their history and the match should generate revenue for Casuals.

Corinthians marketing director Alexandre Ferrera said: 'Corinthians only exist because of the Corinthian-Casuals, and our links go back more than 100 years.

'We have always been open to helping them. We decided to promote a game where the gate money will help them pay the cost of the Brazil trip and the documentary.'
