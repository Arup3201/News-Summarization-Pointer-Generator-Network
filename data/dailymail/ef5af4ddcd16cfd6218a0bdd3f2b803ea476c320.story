Manchester City's teenage left-back Angelino has spoken about the dream moment he got to mark Lionel Messi. 

Angelino, full name Jose Angel Esmoris Tasende, was one of a number of City's elite development squad invited to make up the numbers in a training session with Argentina ahead of their friendly with Portugal at Old Trafford this week.

The World Cup finalists have been training at City's Carrington complex and 17-year-old Angelino was asked to match up against arguably the world's best player in a practice match at the weekend.

The Spaniard, who turned down Barcelona and Real Madrid to join City two years ago, impressed observers including members of the Argentina coach staff.

And Messi took time out afterwards to give him a few words of advice.

Angelino said: 'I couldn't believe I was defending against Messi. I didn't tackle him as I didn't want to injure him! 'It was great experience for me to train with one of the best players in the world. We didn't expect this. To see all those big stars playing with us.' 

The youngster, whose idol is former Brazil left-back Roberto Carlos, was too awestruck to ask Messi for an autograph but the four-time Ballon D'Or winner took time out to speak to him afterwards. Angelino added: 'He was talking to me about my family and then the Argentina left-back was talking to me about my positioning and when I need to go forward or not. I didn't get anything signed, I didn't ask for it.

'Afterwards we were all talking about Messi because he got the ball at one point and dribbled past six or seven players. We were all impressed.

'Here at City I've trained against some of the best players in the world with our first team so I wasn't really nervous but it helps a lot as a young player to come up against someone like him. It's a different style, different class and they've all been where we've been before. I just hope someone took a photograph!' 

Angelino's teammate George Evans took his opportunity; asking Messi to pose for a picture that he posted on his Twitter feed. The 19-year-old midfielder is mixing in different circles today however as he is training with Championship strugglers Blackpool ahead of a loan move.

Jose Angel Esmoris Tasende is a Spanish left back who has been at Manchester City for a couple of years after arriving as a first-year scholar in 2013.

The defender is known as 'Angelino' and has been likened to German World Cup star Mario Gotze because of his looks. He already has the obligatory footballer's tattoo sleeve on his right arm. 

Angelino started his career at Deportivo La Coruna and his exploits with the Spanish side soon caught the attention of City.

He moved to England aged just 15 and his performances for City's academy side have earned him international recognition.
