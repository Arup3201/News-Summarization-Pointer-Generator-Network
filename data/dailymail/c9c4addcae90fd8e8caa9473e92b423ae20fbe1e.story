Collectors of Diana mugs and Will and Kate plates get ready - the new royal baby is set to bring with it a new piece of collectible memorabilia.

To mark the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child, a £5 coin will be issued to celebrate the occasion. 

The forthcoming royal baby - due mid to late April - will be fourth in line to the throne and is not expected to ever rule as monarch, but just like older brother Prince George the occasion will be marked with a commemorative coin.

A commorative £5 coin has been issued to celebrate the birth of the second royal baby. A similar commission was made at the birth of Prince George (his coin pictured) 

The Queen, the baby's great-grandmother, approved the decision at a meeting of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on March 19.

The coins are anticipated to be very popular as thousands of commemorative coins were struck to celebrate the arrival of George in July 2013 and sold out within days.

The Royal Mint produced 10,000 solid silver crown-sized £5 coins, which cost £80 each, and 2,013 (equivalent to his birth year) 22 carat gold sovereigns, which cost £800 each.  

Both featured the prince's namesake St George.

In July 2013 after the birth of Prince George 2013 coins were issued with those born on the same day entitled to a free 'lucky' silver coin 

Babies born on the same day as George were also entitled to receive one of 2,013 free 'lucky' silver pennies.

When George turned one, the occasion was also marked by a commemorative £5 coin - making him the first member of the royal family to have his first birthday honoured with a new UK coin. 

Only 7,500 of the sterling silver crowns were cut and feature the royal arms in a cross-form design. 

His christening was also marked with a coin, which was decorated with traditional lilies and cherubs.

As well as his  birth coin Prince George also had a second £5 coin to mark his first birthday, above
