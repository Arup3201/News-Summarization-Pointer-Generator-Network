Nick Vujicic, a preacher born without limbs, knows all too well that everyone needs a hug sometimes, so today he was offering a comforting embrace to tourists in New York's Times Square.

The Australian, who was taunted at school because of a medical condition that left him without arms and legs, was in New York to promote his book.

During his appearance in Times Square, Vujicic let tourists and fans embrace him as part of his anti-bullying 10,000 Hugs Tour.

Inspiration: The Christian minister met fans of his book, Stand Strong, at the Times Square event

The preacher, who moved to California from Melbourne in 2007, has previously held a Guinness Book of World Records title for the most hugs in one hour.

For the record he took part in 1,749 hugs, but while he met a lot of fans during his appearance today, Vujicic did not break his own record.

The 31-year-old advertized his appearance in Times Square on his Facebook page, posting: 'Good morning New York City! Come meet me in Times Square. I'll be there... to give hugs and raise awareness to #endbullying.'

The author of Stand Strong: You Can Overcome Bullying (and Other Stuff That Keeps You Down has been helping victims for several years.

Message: The Australian devoted his life to spreading God's word after coming to terms with his disability

Support: The 10,000 Hugs Tour is being used to raise awareness on how to overcome bullies

His anti-bullying cause is one close to his heart, after Vujicic struggled with his disability
 as a child, both physically and emotionally.

At the age of ten, after a
 failed suicide attempt, he vowed never to give up again. By the age of 17 he had started his own non-profit charity, Life Without Limbs.

As well as making it on to the New York Times best-selling author's list, Vujicic is also a devoted husband and father.

Before his New York appearance he was pictured playing with his young son and wife on a beach in Hawaii.

In pictures of the vacation, the broad smile on Vujicic's face, and obvious happiness he now has in his life, was testament to one man's triumph over adversity.

The Christian minister was clearly feeling like any other hard-working dad taking a break with his family: he beamed proudly as baby son Kiyoshi toddled about on the shoreline; and shared contented smiles with his wife of two years Kanae.

Dedication: The 31-year-old, pictured meeting a fan, is working tirelessly to combat bullies

Vujicic was born with tetra-amelia syndrome, a rare disorder that is characterized by the absence of all four limbs.

His worldwide motivational speeches tell of courage overcoming disability, and the bullying he suffered as a child. His life and his determination serve as an inspiration to countless thousands worldwide.

But the idyllic holiday the Vujicic family was recently pictured enjoying is more than just the result of the success he has found as an adult.

After university, where he graduated 
with a Bachelor of Commerce, Vujicic embarked on a motivational speaking
 tour, concentrating on teenage issues, disability, and his faith in God
 and how it helps his life.

To date, he has visited more than 40 countries on five continents.

In 2008 Vijucic met Kanae Miyahara, and 
has described it as 'love at first sight'. He was quoted in a 2013 
interview in The Christian Post about the unique way he proposed.

Having the engagement ring in his mouth he casually asked Kanae: 'Baby, can I kiss your hands?'

Kanae admitted that she thought he was simply biting her finger, but then she saw the ring he had been trying to position in the right spot.

Vujicic released his book - Stand Strong: You Can Overcome Bullying - on April 15.

In it he describes how to turn bullies into motivators: 'Bullies want to abuse you. Instead of allowing that, you can use them as your personal motivators,' he writes. 'Power up and let the bully eat your dust.'

Bullies want to abuse you. Instead of allowing that, you can use them as your personal motivators. Power up and let the bully eat your dust. In the pages that follow, I will help you build your antibully antibodies. This is a process that works by building strength from the inside out, from your deepest thoughts and feelings—your heart and soul—to the way you see the world, make decisions, and take actions. You build your bully defense system from the inside out by

1. Figuring out who you are so no bully can tell youdifferently or make you feel badly;

2. Taking responsibility for your own behavior and happiness so bullies have no ultimate power over you;

3. Establishing strong values that no bully can shake;

4. Creating a safety zone within yourself where you can go mentally to draw strength and comfort;

5. Building strong and supportive relationships to stand up for you against bullies;

6. Learning to monitor and manage your responses to the emotions triggered by bullying;

7. Developing a spiritual foundation to help you be at peace and be strong against bullying;

8. Taking the opportunity to learn from your bullying experience so that you can become stronger, wiser, more confident, more faith filled, and more prepared to handle any challenges;

9. Creating your bully defense strategy so you are prepared to handle bullies of all kinds; and

10. Mastering empathy so you are aware of the needs of others and serve them whenever possible to help them overcome bullying.
