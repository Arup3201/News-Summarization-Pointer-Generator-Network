The ultimate gentleman: Sir Winston Churchill (pictured in 1943) has been voted the greatest British gentleman of the last century

Sir Winston Churchill has been named the greatest British gentleman of the last century in a new poll.

The former Prime Minister, who inspired the nation to stand in defiance of Hitler during World War Two, topped the survey of 4,000 people to uncover the greatest gentlemen in modern memory.

Runner-up went to Sir David 
Attenborough, Britain’s best-known natural history film maker who 
brought the hidden secrets of the world to living rooms across the 
country with programs like Life, The Blue Planet and Frozen Planet.

Churchill will forever be remembered 
for embodying the strength and spirit of Britain in one of its darkest 
periods, rousing the public with stirring speeches and broadcasts that 
gave hope to millions.

Bronze
 went to Stephen Fry, whose intelligent and amusing contributions to our
 TV screens and Twitter feeds have made him a national treasure.

A
 spokesman for Austin Reed, which carried out the poll, said: ‘Sir 
Winston Churchill showed unprecedented courage and strength to lead this
 country and is a worthy choice as the greatest British gentleman.

‘In fact, Austin Reed made Winston Churchill’s famous siren suits during the war.

‘There were plenty of great contenders 
for the role, and the results are a pleasing reminder of the number of 
great characters and personalities that inspire the general public.

‘It’s nice to see modern men in the list such as David Beckham, Jenson Button and David Tennant.

‘They all epitomise effortless style and have a real flair for fashion - which is an essential trait for any gentleman.’

It was a regal finish for Prince William who came in fourth, with this year’s Royal Wedding coverage evidence of the place the young Prince holds in the British public’s hearts.

And it was screen royalty that rounded off the top five in the shape of Colin Firth, who wowed us with his Oscar-winning portrayal of King George VI in The King’s Speech.

Actor David Niven took sixth spot, while it was 007 for former Bond star Roger Moore, with Michael Caine coming in eighth.

Sporting superstar David Beckham could only manage ninth place, while Saturday night sensation Bruce Forsyth completed the top 10.

Other men to feature included newsreader Trevor McDonald at number 11, actors Hugh Grant at 12, David Jason at 14 and pop star Cliff Richard at number 17.

Younger gentlemen: Young men to make the list were Robert Pattinson (left) at 44 and Prince Harry at 25

Former Doctor Who star David Tennant was voted the 22nd greatest gent, and Sir Ian McKellen came in at 23rd.

And there may be arguments at the palace as Prince Harry finished a place above his father, Prince Charles in 25th.

A surprising appearance for Simon Cowell placed the usually sharp-tongued pop guru as the 35th greatest British gentlemen.

Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton overtook his fellow driver Jenson Button to land 40th spot, while vampire heartthrob Robert Pattinson made number 43.

A spokesman for Austin Reed added: ‘Everyone has a different view on what makes a proper English gentleman whether it’s manners, sense of humour or even accent and it’s good to see a diverse range in this list from Hugh Grant to Michael Parkinson or Trevor McDonald.

‘A man’s dress sense is a huge part of his persona and British classic style has always been what one associates with the concept of a gentleman.

‘Classic, heritage style is on the rise, and with that, we hope for a resurgence of the gentleman too.’
