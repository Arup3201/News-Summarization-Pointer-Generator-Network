From 6am in the morning until long into the night, a steady stream of mourners arrived at the house where eight children were senselessly killed - and before long the street outside was filled with tributes.  

Hundreds of people walked to the park, which had been the little victims favourite place, to pay their respects and leave candles, flowers, teddy bears, and handwritten notes.

Some residents even left Christmas presents and mince pies, admitting they 'couldn't possibly celebrate Christmas this year.'

'I'm not going to celebrate Christmas this year,' said local Sam O'Grady as she visited the makeshift tribute site.

'There's no way you can celebrate Christmas at a time like this - it's too close to home,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald. 

Residents of the small town of Manoora were still in shocked by the tragic events of the day before, and acknowledged that after seeing the Martin Place siege memorial, the people of Cairns needed to turn the park into a space which honoured the lives lost.

The mother of seven of the children, Mersane Warria, 37, remained in hospital after being arrested on Friday over the murders.

The 37-year-old has been charged with eight counts of murder, and appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns Base Hospital on Sunday morning.

Indigenous youth advocate Tania Major said the town could not imagine celebrating in the wake of the eight deaths.

'There would be no music and no partying - even no fishing on their country - while the community grieves,' she said. 

Friends, relatives, and members of the tight-knit Cairns suburb hugged each other and wept, and local Queensland Police officers visited the house to comfort residents. 

Eight little angels figurines have been placed by one resident, to symbolise the eight children whose lives were tragically cut short.

'I hope they've gone to a better place. They were such happy children. I tell my children that they're looking after us,' said one mourner.

Family members of the eight children sat in the park immediately adjacent to the crime scene, for more than three hours, watching the memorial grow. 

Teddy bears were placed at the bottom of the tree opposite the house, with parents bringing their children to leave tokens in sympathy with the family.

Pasta and pasta sauce are placed in a bag in a nod to the children's favourite food, along with floral bouquets made from blooms of the flame trees which line Cairn's streets.

Local children brought butcher's paper and art supplies, painting signs and pictures to hang at the memorial site.

Shirts inscribed with notes of sympathy were hung in the trees, with more blooms weaved into the roots. 

One neighbour lamented that they hadn't tried to help, asking 'How did this mother slip through the cracks?' 

A plastic container has been put down in the community garden at the base of a tree, with a note reading, 'Any contribution will help this family through this hard time. Thanks'.

'Any money will got towards the funerals,' their relative explained.

'They don't have the money. It's a big stress. Any money left over will go to the police and emergency people. They need help as much as the family.' 

The Salvation Army were at the Murray Street site to assist mourners in the heat, along with a local Christian youth group to entertain children at the community centre at the street corner.
