Caught: William Duncan, 43, was snared when he unwittingly sold the class-A drug to undercover officers outside Mae Luster Stephens Junior High in Linden, Texas

TV hit Breaking Bad is a gritty drama that reflects America's real-life problems with crystal meth addiction.

But it appears the popular show is more realistic than producers may have imagined - after a Texas chemistry teacher was caught selling home-made meth at the junior high school in which he taught.

William Duncan, 43, was snared when he unwittingly sold the class-A drug to undercover officers in the car park of Mae Luster Stephens Junior High in Linden, Texas.

Moments later, police say, the school bell sounded for class.

The case is uncannily reminiscent of hit AMC drama Breaking Bad, which follows the exploits of a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who becomes a ruthless drug 
baron to support his family after he's diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Duncan's case, though, was somewhat less glamorous.

While police do not believe he ever sold the crude narcotic to any of his students, they say he had been using the school's campus to peddle his wares for some time.

'We were surprised. I've known him 
for a long time and I'd have never thought it,' said Linden Police Chief
Alton McWaters told KLTV.

'He's real upset about what he's done. But as I told him, I've got to do my job - and you've got to go to jail.'

He said when they arrested Duncan they found a stash of the drug in the back of his van, parked nearby.

Dealing on your doorstep: Duncan was caught after a police sting selling the narcotic in this playground minutes before the school bell sounded

Linden Police Chief Alton McWaters: 'He's real upset about what he's done. But as I told him, I've got to do my job - and you've got to go to jail'

The arrest follows a five-month investigation by police into the sale of crystal meth in the area.

He
added: 'We've been conducting an undercover operation for about five 
months and buying narcotics and we had bought off of this person a few 
weeks back.

'We set-up another buy from him. He sold it to us at the school, at the junior high school where he teaches.'

Life and art: The fictional Walter White, played by Emmy-winner Bryan Cranston, is a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who becomes a ruthless drug baron to support his family after he's diagnosed with terminal cancer

Big hit: The show
stars Cranston alongside Aaron Paul who plays a slackers former student 
of White, who team up to manufacture and distribute huge quantities of 
the drug in New Mexico

He said Duncan admitted also using meth for physical pain.

He was charged with delivery of a controlled substance in a drug-free zone.

It is the second time real life has imitated Breaking Bad.

Street name for methamphetamine - hyper-charged member of amphetamine family

Odourless, white crystalline powder - but some forms have strong ammonia smell, because of solvents used to make it

Increases arousal in nervous system: pumps up levels of norepinephrine and dopamine

At low doses boosts alertness and blocks hunger and fatigue; higher doses causes exhilaration and euphoria; very high doses cause agitation and paranoia

Physically increases heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature

Anxiety, emotional swings, and paranoia are common psychological effects of chronic use

Overdose is a huge risk: Symptoms include fever, convulsions, and coma

Death can result from burst blood vessels in the brain (triggered by spikes in blood pressure) or heart failure

High tends to last 4-12 hours with users continuing to take the drug for days - sometimes addicts stay awake for days, eat very little and in heightened state of arousal

Last month, a man who shares the same name with TV's
most famous meth dealer - Breaking Bad's Walter White - was arrested by 
authorities in Alabama, for making meth.

White, who shares a name with the 
fictional meth dealer from the AMC TV show Breaking Bad was found in an 
inpatient treatment facility after news of his coincidental name made 
national headlines.

According to court documents, he was 
placed on probation in Tuscaloosa County in 2010 after being arrested in
2008 on charges of trafficking methamphetamine, unlawful manufacturing 
of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance and 
possession of precursor materials.

The fictional Walter White, played by Emmy-winner Bryan Cranston, is a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who becomes a ruthless drug 
baron to support his family after he's diagnosed with terminal cancer.

The show, created by Vince Gilligan, 
stars Cranston alongside Aaron Paul who plays a slackers former student 
of White, who team up to manufacture and distribute huge quantities of 
the drug in New Mexico.

It is currently in its fifth and final season. Cranston has won three consecutive Emmys.

Methamphetamine abuse is exploding across rural America as cooks find it increasingly easier to manufacture the drug at home or in make-shift factories thanks to increased availability of its main ingredient - Pseudoephedrine.

In Kentucky, for example, police say instances ofÂ  'meth labs' being uncovered across the state have trebled in the last three years.

Pseudoephedrine can be easily bought over the counter in pharmacies in medicine such as Sudafed. And while they may provide relief to cold sufferers, to criminals who
are in the business of making meth, these pills are gold.
