It does not get any more emphatic than this. England, so desolate after Lord’s, were utterly irresistible. India, with such an opportunity to make history in this series after going one up, were pathetic. The transformation is complete.

What a turnaround for Alastair Cook and England since they went one down in the second Test with a last-day collapse that saw knives being increasingly sharpened for the captain and all those involved in their rebuilding programme.

What an embarrassment for MS Dhoni and India as they contemplate their total surrender at The Kia Oval to follow equally abject displays at Southampton and Old Trafford.

They simply capitulated here and their captain should consider his position but, India being India, they will probably just shrug their shoulders and move on to one-day cricket. That’s what has made their players millionaires.

There can rarely have been a more one-sided day than this, more so even than the third in Manchester which saw India lose nine wickets in a session despite Stuart Broad being injured, Jimmy Anderson being ill and a hurricane on the way that would have washed out the last two days.

From the first ball on Sunday England were supreme, pretty much as they have been ever since Cook started turning things around with both bat and his captaincy at the Ageas Bowl. They have won just about every session since.

How purposeful was batting that, led by Joe Root and featuring a courageous cameo from Broad, smashed another 101 runs in just 11.3 overs on the third day to take England’s lead up to a commanding 338. India would not have got past that if they had been given three more innings, let alone another one.

As it was 
they lasted a mere 29.2 overs, barely a session, with only a shower 
enabling them to hold out until 4.22pm and the humiliation of being 
bowled out for 94. It was India who were the biggest shower. In their 
last five innings they mustered 178, 152, 161, 148 and now double 
figures, worse even than England’s harrowing performances in Australia.

How
 to explain it? Yes, India have been terrible but it would be wrong to 
take anything away from England. There had been near misses and promise 
all season, as there will be with any virtually new side, but from 
Southampton onwards the senior spine delivered the goods and that made 
all the difference.

Now they are looking like a team again, one with the perfect mix of exciting emerging players and experienced ones at the top of their game. Certainly Anderson and Broad now seem as potent as any new-ball pairing in England’s history while Ian Bell has finally become a leader rather than follower.

Then there is the captain. Few England skippers can have suffered as much opprobrium as Cook when the bitter post-Ashes aftermath threatened to engulf him. He was close to packing it all in after the fourth day against Sri Lanka at Headingley when he had a nightmare in the field but, after vowing not to be a quitter, he has shown immense character in fighting back. One tough Cookie indeed.

This 3-1 victory and Cook’s return to something near his best form cements him as England’s captain for next year’s Ashes, barring a complete collapse in fortunes, and he has visibly grown as a leader over the last three Tests.

He will certainly have relished the final rites of this Investec series. What a batsman Root has grown into this year, his unbeaten 149 taking his series average to 103 while the speed of his runs ran India ragged.

And what character, too, from Broad, who came out to bat with his nose broken in two places little more than a week ago and proceeded to flay the inevitable short-pitched bowling that came his way to all parts of The Oval. He struck 37 from 21 balls and in a flash England had got up to 486 all out.

Could India at least show some fight, a little application to restore a semblance of pride for the millions of fans in their cricket-mad country? Not a bit of it. They batted like a village side to collapse to their third crunching defeat, their second by an innings and their third heaviest hammering of all time.

Anderson needed six victims to overtake Sir Ian Botham and become England’s leading Test wicket-taker but could manage just two thanks to the collective effort of the attack. He will not mind that and must now wait until his 100th Test in Antigua next April for his crowning moment.

Broad, who had such a poor game at Lord’s, was a menacing accomplice to Anderson while here, unlike at Old Trafford, the supporting cast of Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes were almost as dangerous, Jordan sent India hurtling to their demise with four wickets for 17 in just 19 balls. Thrashed is an under-statement.

England will confirm on Monday that Cook will carry on as one-day captain for the start of the build-up to February’s World Cup, and why not? After rising to the biggest challenge of his career he has earned the right to do that.

Bigger than the World Cup, of course, are the Ashes and it will not be long before Australia come calling again. Bring on the Aussies? Well, England have some way to go before we can say that but there is promise that they can regain the urn now when as recently as last month there was little more than despair.

Crisis, what crisis?
