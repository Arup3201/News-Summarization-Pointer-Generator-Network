Using an iPad, smartphone or computer can be a boost for older people, researchers say

If you want to help an elderly relative cope with ageing and illness, give them a tablet – of the hi-tech variety.

For using an iPad, smartphone or computer can be a boost for older people, researchers say.

Becoming a silver surfer on Facebook, Twitter and other online social media networks helps combat disease and loneliness, a study found.

Going online via an increasing range of easy-to-use devices gives access to a valuable source of support.

It allows the elderly to use social networks, join discussion boards to beat loneliness, find out information about illnesses or exchange experiences. 

Researchers from the University of Luxembourg found that merely using a computer or similar web-enabled device successfully helped older people feel better about themselves.

But using social media provided even greater benefits, said researcher Dr Anja Leist.

Dr Leist, who aims to design websites that are easier for the elderly to use, said: ‘Older adults can use social media to access health-related information and engage in patient-to-patient or patient-doctor conversations.

‘There are many online forums where people in difficult life situations, such as informal caregivers of a spouse with dementia or individuals with depression, can exchange thoughts as well as receive and provide support.’

Besides the potential for clinical practise and other positive consequences in everyday use of social media, the researchers also addressed the possible negative consequences of social media use.

Although more research was needed, adverse affects could include access to harmful information and misuse of personal data.

Other negative effects have been shown to be unfavourable social comparisons due to overly positive self-representations of others displayed in online social networks.

The study ‘Social media use of older adults - A mini-review’ is published by the university’s research unit INSIDE.
