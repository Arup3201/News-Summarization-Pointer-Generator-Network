Barclays paid 428 bankers more than £1 million in 2012, despite suffering a torrid year in which the bank's chief executive Bob Diamond and its chairman Marcus Agius were forced to resign after Barclays was fined £290million for rigging Libor interest rates.

The number of staff paid over £1 million was down from 473 in 2011, according to new disclosures in its annual report released on Friday.

Barclays said five staff were paid over £5million last year, down from 17 people in 2011. A further 50 were paid between £2.5million and £5million in 2012, and 373 staff were paid between £1million and £2.5million.

Bank bonanza: Over 400 Barclays bank staff have received bonuses of more than £1million this year that bank has disclosed.

The pay included salary, bonus and the value of long-term share awards.

While more than 400 workers picked up 
more than £1 million, there were more than 71,500 staff who received 
less than £25,000 last year.

Employees picked up an average £13,000 in bonuses, with investment bankers taking £54,100 on average.

Chief
Executive Antony Jenkins was paid £2.6million, including £1.8million for his time as CEO from 30th August. He said last month he would 
forgo his bonus in the wake of the Libor rate fixing scandal and subsequent fine. Jenkins had previously been the head of retail and business banking.

The pay details will stoke controversy 
after the bank recently reported pre-tax profits plunging to £246million
from £5.9billion in 2011 following a scandal-hit year which saw it pay 
£290 million for its Libor rigging settlement and £2.5 billion to cover 
mis-selling claims.

Barclays also faced allegations that it lent the Qatari royal family the money they invested in the bank at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.

At the time Barclays was hailed as one of the few British banks that did not need to be rescued by the taxpayer.

Finance chief Chris Lucas is under 
investigation over fess paid as part of the 2008 emergency fund-raising in the Middle 
East along with several other current and former Barclays executives.

The
bank revealed the pay bands for all its 145,000 staff, following 
through on a promise by new chairman David Walker to provide greater 
transparency on pay.

The report also confirmed that former
Barclays' boss Bob Diamond - who quit last summer in the wake of the 
bank's Libor-fixing settlement - will continue to be paid salary and 
pension until July.

He stepped down last summer, but 
remains entitled to an annual salary of £1.4 million and £675,000 a year
cash in lieu of pension.

The new management team has pledged to address 
cultural problems at Barclays after criticism it was too aggressive and 
took too much risk in the past, but has admitted rebuilding the bank and
its reputation could take 5-10 years.

Barclays also said it reduced its 2012 bonus pool by £860 million for Libor rigging and mis-selling, while it clawed back an additional £300 million in previous awards and long-term incentives for the Libor scandal.

A potential £3.3 billion bonus pool was also reduced by a further £250 million to better align its pay in the market, although it still shared out a total incentives pot worth £2.2 billion.

Sir John Sunderland, head of Barclays' remuneration committee, said in the report: ‘I hope that 2012 will be seen as a turning point in the way Barclays approaches remuneration.’

He added the committee will continue to focus on overhauling pay and bonus practices across the bank over the coming months.

Mr Jenkins, who announced he would waive his annual bonus for 2012 in January, is leading a crusade to overhaul the culture and ethics at Barclays.

As part of his restructure at the bank, he last month announced plans to axe at least 3,700 jobs.

He is shutting the bank's controversial Structured Capital Markets tax advisory division, with 1,800 jobs being cut in corporate and investment banking and another 1,900 across its European retail and business arm under plans to slash costs by £1.7 billion.

Around 1,600 investment banking jobs have already gone, but few of the overall staff cuts will have an impact on its UK workforce.
