Manuel Pellegrini insists Yaya Toure never wanted to leave Manchester City in the summer and maintains his slow start to the season is down to personal problems.

The 31-year-old scored City’s opener as they beat Aston Villa on Saturday night - his first Premier League goal since May.

There have been serious questions raised over Toure’s lack of consistency for the champions, but Pellegrini believes that is due to the death of his brother Ibrahim earlier this year rather than angling for a move away.

Yaya Toure celebrates his first goal of the season for Manchester City after copping criticism in recent weeks

Toure weaves his shot through the Aston Villa defence to score the opener in City's 2-0 win at Villa Park 

Toure is swamped by his team-mates after breaking the deadlock after 82 minutes against stoic Villa

Asked about a situation whereby the Ivorian complained about the lack of club a birthday cake and appeared to make it clear his future lay elsewhere, the manager said: ‘I’ve spoken with him about that - it was a misunderstanding of some words. He didn’t have any problem with the club. He had things with his private life but didn’t want to go anywhere.

‘He’s an experienced player. He has been criticised over the last two weeks but I know the way he thinks and can play. 

'Yaya last season also played bad games. He scored so many goals that everybody talked about that. I have no concerns about him.’ 

Manuel Pellegrini says early season talk that Toure wanted to leave City was a 'misunderstanding of words'

Pellegrini says his has no concerns over the form of his at times phenomenal midfielder

Toure showed glimpses that he could be somewhere close to his best soon. 

‘It’s amazing to score my first goal,' the midfielder said. 'The most important thing for me is to do my best and help the team.

'It’s not so easy because I have to play every three days. People have to understand I am not a machine - I am a man.

‘It’s fantastic to win after the draw against Roma in midweek as it was difficult for us to come back.’
