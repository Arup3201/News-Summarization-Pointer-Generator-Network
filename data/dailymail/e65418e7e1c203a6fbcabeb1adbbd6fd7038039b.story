A cancer scare would be enough to make most of us rethink aspects of our lives but for 32-year-old Ruth Dales, it provided the impetus she needed to transform it.

Despite a fulfilling career as a pharmacist, Ruth had long dreamed of becoming a fitness model but had put her aspirations on the back-burner.

Then fate struck, when Ruth was told she ran a high risk of developing cervical cancer after a doctor's appointment.

The colposcopy, a treatment which involves having abnormal cells burned away, that followed left her with a month at home to fill while she recovered.

And, incredibly, instead of sitting at home feeling sorry for herself, she used it to train for her first ever fitness modelling competition.Â 

'I had been given this massive health scare and I didn't want to wallow in my own misery,' she explains.

'I decided I was going to go after something I had wanted to do all my life. I
 have always had sly comments from girls about the way I look, they 
would say nice things to my face and then make horrible comments behind 
my back to try and knock my confidence.

'Letting
 people get the better of me was something I didn't want to do as I 
thought life was too short to listen to jealousy from people.'

And
 so with just five weeks to train, Ruth entered a competition run by the UK Body Fitness Federation, which she hoped would kickstart her fitness modelling career.

To her complete surprise she was crowned the Midlands champion. 'I couldn't believe that I won, I hadn't trained for very long 
and didn't think I would even come runner-up let alone winner,' she reveals.

'There are all sorts of models at these contests - tall, short, plus size - but it's all fine as long as you're fit and healthy.

'Beauty comes from living a healthy life. Clothes and make-up are just the icing on the cake.'

With her homegrown triumph complete, Ruth will now travel to Los Angeles to compete against women from all over the world.

'I had always been healthy and fit but then when I got the cancer scare it made me think you only live once and you have to follow your dreams,' explains Ruth.

'I had thought about doing modelling for some time but I was always scared that people would think I was vain when all I want to do is promote good health.

'When I began to win at different modelling events I realised this was a really great way of being a spokeswoman for fitness and good health.'

Despite her travel plans and modelling success, Ruth says she has no intention of giving up her day job.

'Even if I won the lottery, there's no way I would give up this job,' she explains. 'I trained for six years and it's something I will always have an interest in.

'I have an exciting job, making sure that the right people get the right drugs and GPs are great people to work with.'
