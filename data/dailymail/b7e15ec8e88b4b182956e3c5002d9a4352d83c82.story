The drawbacks of being a working Mum caught up with Madison Ashton when on a trip to her son's school the teenagers gathered around, not to chat to their mate's parent, but to get a good look at a high-class escort, porn star and mistress.  

For a change the teenagers had no problems doing their homework as they'd obviously been studying the notorious Ms Ashton for quite a while.

'The boys were swarming around me, and I could hear them mentioning my work name under their breath,' Ms Ashton told New Idea magazine. 'Unfortunately, they'd been online and obviously knew just who I was.'

Madison Ashton (pictured here at court in 2012) lost her appeal against the estate of the late cardboard billionaire, Richard Pratt, in February

It was an experience that she worried would have a bad effect on her 13-year-old son Xavier, but she had no need to worry.

'I asked what was going on and he said a few boys had told him: "Hey your Mum's a prostitute." But he didn't take any notice,' she explained.

'He just went back to playing handball, because he thought they were d**kheads anyway. I was totally blown away by how brave and mature Xavier is.'

Ms Ashton - who also has a 17-year-old daughter Indra - only tells Xavier that she goes to work and can't discuss it in detail because it involves adult services. 

The 40-year-old made it clear that she was always honest with her children about what she does and kept everything very 'matter-of-fact'.

But considering her notoriety it's hard for her at times to stay out of the news. 

Last month she lost her appeal against the estate of billionaire Richard Pratt, who she said promised her millions. 

Ms Ashton launched an appeal against the 2012 decision to reject her bid for part of the cardboard king's estate.

Ms Ashton said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two children and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress.

Although the Supreme Court agreed the pair had the conversation, it found Ms Ashton's acceptance of $100,000 and the transfer of car into her name was done in full satisfaction of the trust claim.

In November 2005, Ms Ashton signed a document from a employee of Mr Pratt's company, Visy Industries, that released Mr Pratt from any financial responsibility in exchange for a payment of $50,000 to the former mistress.

Mr Pratt died in 2009.

Ms Ashton appeared before the Supreme Court of NSW in February but her case was dismissed

In appealing the decision, Ms Ashton sought a declaration that Mr Pratt's 2003 promises constituted a legally binding contract and anything she signed in November 2005 was void.

She also sought damages from Mr Pratt's widdoe, Jeanne Pratt.

But on Monday, the Court of Appeal dismissed her bid, saying the arrangement failed to spell out important terms such as Ms Ashton's obligations as mistress, how long it would last and the details of how the trusts would work.

The court said Ms Ashton had received substantial gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress and there was nothing to suggest she was prevented from returning to the escort industry.

Madison Ashton, who was once showered with gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress, claims the two of them were in a de-facto relationship, and it was not just a 'business' arrangement the pair had.

Ms Ashton, who also sued the cardboard baron's estate for $10 million in 2012 lost and racked up a million dollar legal bill.

In September, The Daily Telegraph reported, the court heard Pratt had a 'voracious appetite' for young woman like Ms Ashton and that promising her five million dollars wouldn't have been very much money to such a wealthy man.

It was reported she claimed to have given up a lucrative career in the high class escort business to become Mr Pratt's mistress

A book called 'Mistress: The True Stories of Mistresses and Their Men' released last year delved into the couples bizarre relationship.

Writer Matthew Benns and co-author Terry Smyth say Mr Pratt was one of Australia's business giants, but  it wasn't just wealth that pleased him.

Rather, he had an 'apparently endless desire' for sex, Benns and Smyth wrote, sustaining two long-running affairs with a pair of young women from the bush.

They were Shari-Lea Hitchcock, from Cambewarra, on the New South Wales south coast; and Peggy Jane Heslop - better known as Madison Ashton, sex worker and Penthouse Pet - who came from Wangaratta, in Victoria's north-east.

Hitchcock was a 'blonde bombshell, 35 years his junior,' Benns and Smyth wrote. While Ashton was described as a canny brothel-owner with a troubled childhood.
