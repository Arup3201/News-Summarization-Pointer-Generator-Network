Police activity: Sheriff's deputy Edeania Nettles, above, was arrested after getting into a fight with St Cloud police officer Jennifer Hoyos, a woman she believes was having an affair with her husband

A love triangle involving three police officers exploded in violence with one of the women having a large clump of hair ripped from head.

Sheriff’s deputy Edeania Nettles is alleged to have dragged her younger rival from a car after she found her with her husband.

Jennifer Hoyos had a large clump of hair ripped from her scalp and suffered a bleeding lip as well as bruising as she was pulled through the open window of a police cruiser.

Hoyos, 26, and Nettles,39, fought on the ground before being separated by John Nettles.

The fight took place at midnight in a park in St Cloud, near Orlando, Florida, while Hoyos was on duty and in uniform.

She and Nettles 36, are serving officers with St Cloud police while Edeania is with Osceola County Sherriff’s Department

Investigators said Nettles had followed her husband to the park where he had met up with Hoyos.

The pair were said to have been chatting when Edeania approached Hoyos' vehicle, reached in through the window and punched her on the left side of her face.

Edeania grabbed Hoyos by the hair and pulled her out of her patrol vehicle, investigators said.

The deputy and the officer continued to fight and Edeania Nettles' estranged husband had to break them up.

A police spokesman said Hoyos was in duty at the time but Mr Nettles was not her supervisors. The police spokesman did not say why they were together.

Hoyos ended up with bleeding lips, a clump of hair that was pulled out and was hanging off of her duty uniform, a bleeding right knee and scratches to the right side of her face.

Edeania Nettles was charged with battery on an officer.

She was immediately removed from duty while the Sheriff's Office investigates and faces being fired.
