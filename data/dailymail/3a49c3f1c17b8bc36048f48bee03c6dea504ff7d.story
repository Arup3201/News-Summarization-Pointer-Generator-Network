Manchester City have held talks with Sergio Aguero to underline their desire to keep him well beyond this summer.

The brilliant Argentina striker is understood to have met City owner Sheik Mansour in London last week.

Despite being hindered by niggling injuries, Aguero has still scored 26 goals in 28 games this season to cement his reputation as one of the best forwards in the world.

That standing means he is continuing to attract interest from the likes of Real Madrid who have wanted him at the Bernabeu since he emerged on the Spanish scene at neighbours Atletico.

City realise a move back to sunnier climes and a Spanish-speaking community is a potentially attractive proposition but they are determined to show he is valued as a pivotal part of their plans.

He is expected to be fit to face Liverpool in the crucial Premier League clash this weekend and the ultimate goal is for him to spearhead City's Champions League challenge next season.

Losing a talent such as Aguero would be extremely difficult to replace with only Liverpool's Luis Suarez considered in the same bracket at this stage.

Although chief executive Ferran Soriano has already underlined to Florentino Perez at Real Madrid that Aguero is not for sale at any price, Sheik Mansour wanted to ensure Aguero understands just how much he is appreciated.

City will continue to look at strengthening their support for him with Monaco's Radamel Falcao an option they are considering and talks ongoing for the likes of Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando at Porto.

Meanwhile, the latest City player to interest the ever-busy Inter Milan is midfielder Javi Garcia. The Italians would like to arrange a loan deal but City would prefer a permanent deal.

Atletico Madrid will consider asking for Petr Cech should Chelsea make Thibaut Courtois their No 1 goalkeeper next season.

Atletico
 want Courtois to accept a new deal at Chelsea as they believe it 
represents the best chance of him being loaned out to them again next 
season.

However, Jose 
Mourinho is understood to be seriously considering promoting the 
excellent Belgian to his first team next season leaving Atletico with 
the prospect of looking at alternatives. Cech will be one of them but 
they will also evaluate other keepers in Spain and Pepe Reina at 
Liverpool.

Tottenham
 are favourites to sign Adam Lallana in the summer despite interest from
 other clubs. There is an expectation at St Mary's that the talented 
crop of Southampton players could break up this summer as England's and 
Europe's elite circle their young stars.

Striker
 Jay Rodriguez, who is to undergo a scan on his injured knee on Monday, may 
yet end up staying for another season but Lallana is widely tipped to 
leave once the right bid is made.

Manchester
 United and City have watched Lallana but Tottenham have made it clear 
they are keen on taking him to White Hart Lane as part of their summer 
rejig. Spurs have already confirmed an interest in Romelu Lukaku but they would have to outbid all rivals for Chelsea to 
consider selling to them.

Real
 Madrid have joined the 
likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, City and Liverpool in admiring Southampton's teenage left back Luke Shaw but they still seem more intent on signing Alberto 
Moreno from Sevilla, who again remains on United's list.

Seydou Doumbia is expected to secure a move to the Premier League this summer.

The Ivory Coast striker has scored 16 goals in 18 games for CSKA Moscow this season and is once again attracting keen interest across Europe with his agent Jean Bernard Beytrison sounding out potential clubs.

The 26-year-old was the Golden Boot winner in Russia in 2012 and, although injury curtailed his following season, he has returned to form this year.

However, Doumbia will be hoping most of the big Premier League sides don't get their main target this summer, that's because he is emerging as a popular back-up.

Chelsea and Arsenal are among his admirers. They have monitored his scoring exploits over recent seasons but CSKA's variable valuations ranging from £15m to £30m have put them off negotiations.

This time round, Chelsea want two strikers and Doumbia is coming in at around No 5 on their list of preferences which is topped by Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa.

Arsenal consider him to be around fourth on their list while he is also being discussed at Everton and Newcastle but may prove too expensive for their budget.

QPR have agreed a new three year deal 
with 18-year-old winger Michael Petrasso. The Canada Under-20 
international, has been linked with former manager Mark Hughes at Stoke,
 and would have been out of contract in the summer. Petrasso has had two
 loan spells in League One this season, with Oldham and Coventry. 

Wolves are continuing to show interest in Portsmouth midfielder Jed Wallace.

The 20-year-old England U19 man has rediscovered his form under the tutelage of caretaker manager Andy Awford and has turned in some dependable performances despite the club's slide towards the foot of League Two.

Middlesbrough, Derby County and Millwall have also been watching Wallace this season but Wolves will prove an exciting project as they seek to follow up promotion from League One with an concerted attempt on replicating that in the Championship next season.

Newly-promoted Leicester City are ready to contest with the big boys for Argentinian prospect Luciano Vietto.

The 20-year-old, tipped to follow compatriots Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez to Europe, has a £7.5million buy-out clause but cash-strapped Racing Club are willing to accept around £6m with add-ons to ensure a sale this summer.

Everton, Liverpool and Arsenal have all been made aware of the 5ft 8in forward, who has scored two in his last three games and has a dual Italian passport. However, Leicester are also keen to speak to his representatives as they look to strengthen their squad in key areas early in the summer to prepare for their Premier League return.
