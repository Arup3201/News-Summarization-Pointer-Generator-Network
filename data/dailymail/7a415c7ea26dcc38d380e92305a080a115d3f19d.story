Relatives of Bobbi Kristina Brown, who has been in a medically induced coma for more than 10 days, have reportedly agreed to let her die tomorrow - the same date as her mother.

The daughter of the late Whitney Houston, and singer Bobby Brown, was found face down in a bath tub and was later discovered with bruises over her body and face.

She has been in a medically induced coma ever since and relatives are now thought to be discussing allowing her to die tomorrow, Page Six reported.

Cissy Houston, grandmother to Miss Brown, suggested the family  turn off the machine so that the 21-year-old could be allowed to die on Wednesday, which will be the same date as her late mother. 

Whitney Houston died on February 11, 2012, after being found in a bath at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

Cissy Houston and Bobbi Kristina's uncle Pat Houston arrived at the hospital on Tuesday to give Bobbi Kristina their support. 

A police source told  DailyMail.com on Thursday that Miss Brown's life support had already been turned off, but patients can live for a number of days after this artificial assistance has been withdrawn. Bobby Brown previously denied they were preparing to say goodbye to his daughter.

The news that Miss Brown's family may be preparing for her death come after around 500 family members and fans gathered for an emotional candlelit vigil to pray for the recovery of Miss Brown in a Shining a Light for Healing vigil, held in Georgia, on Monday evening.

Since Miss Brown was admitted to hospital the Brown and Houston families have reportedly been at loggerheads. 

'This is the only thing they can agree on — that she's gone, and there's nothing more than can be done for her,' a source told pagesix. 

Bruises were discovered on Miss Brown after she was admitted into hospital, sparking a police investigation into possible domestic abuse. But friends of the 21-year-old's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, claimed the marks on her chest were made as he tried to revive her.

Miss Brown was found face down in a bathtub of a home in the 9000 block of Riverbend Manor in Roswell, Georgia, more than a week ago,

The 21-year-old has been in a medically induced coma since January 31.

No charges have been filed in the case, but police are investigating suspected abuse and drug use.

Brown's relatives have said Miss Brown is in a hospital 'fighting for her life.'

Around 500 people gathered for the vigil on Monday evening, singing gospel songs and saying prayers for the recovery of Miss Brown. 

The vigil, which also include the recitation of passages from scripture, was led by Bishop Donald Battle. 

Documentary producer Daphne Barak, who is friends with Miss Browns boyfriend, Nick Gordon, said that he told her over the phone how he left marks on his girlfriend's chest while performing compressions in a desperate bid to revive her.

'Nick told me that the bruises were from his CPR,' Barak said, according to RadarOnline. 

On Monday, Bobbi's grandmother Cissy Houston and her father, Bobby Brown, gathered at her bedside at Emory University Hospital.

At about 7pm local time, some 500 people filled the Amphitheater at Riverdale Town Center for a vigil in Bobbi's honor titled Shining a Light for Healing.

Supporters of the Brown family, some of whom were in attendance, prayed and sang gospel songs together while waving flashlights in the air, asking God to perform a miracle for Bobbi.

Riverdale Mayor Evelyn Wynn-Dixon was among those who sang gospel hymns on stage, as members of the crowd sang and danced along.

Several vigil speakers touched on the struggles and scrutiny Brown's family has faced in recent years, comparing them to their own trials and tribulations.

'They bleed and hurt like us,' Wynn-Dixon told the crowd before singing the gospel song 'There's a leak in this old building.'

Brian and Poco Reese, both 52, of Johns Creek, Georgia, said they would make the roughly 40-mile drive back home feeling refreshed, uplifted and hopeful for Bobbi Kristina's recovery.

'We just continue to pray that the Lord does his will and whatever that may be for Bobbi Kristina's life on Earth, we don't know that,' Brian Reese said.

'We watched her grow over the years. We love her,' Poco Reese added. 'You know, with everything she's gone through, with everything she's endured, we love her even more.' 

Bobbi's uncle, Tommy Brown, described the Monday night event to the New York Daily News as 'beautiful.'

City of Riverdale Marketing Specialist Corey Punzi says he planned the event to support Brown's family because Bobby Brown was the first artist to perform at the city's amphitheater in 2010.

Police,citing an ongoing investigation, have not disclosed many details of the circumstances in which Brown was found. Houston was also found unresponsive in a bathtub on February 11, 2012, and later died.
