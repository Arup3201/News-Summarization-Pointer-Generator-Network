Fairytale home seeks princess. That could be the estate agent’s pitch for a garden flat decorated in pink that has gone on sale near Harrods in southwest London.

The two-bedroom home in Lennox Gardens has been furnished and decorated as if it was being lived in by Sleeping Beauty and is one sale for £1.7million.

It has pink walls and ceiling throughout and the bigger bedroom has a light pink four poster bed with matching coloured curtains.

Where a princess like Sleeping Beauty could lay her head until Prince Charming comes along to wake her up with a kiss

The patio has pink garden furniture and a splash of different colour is added by the plants and trees.

The flat is ten times the price of the average home sold in England and Wales but is relatively cheap for the swanky area because it only has 36 years remaining on its lease.

The asking price works out at £47,000 per year or a little under £4,000 per month - which is around the going rate to rent a two-bedroom flat in the area.

The living room of the flat in Knightsbridge's Lennox Gardens, on sale for a bargain £1.7million - as long as you don't mind a lease that runs out in 36 years and a service charge of £19,000 a year

Before your rush out with your chequebooks or debit cards, there is also £5,000 to pay for ground rent and a service charge of £19,000 a year say estate agents Strutt and Parker.

It has an entrance hall, drawing room and dining room which is linked via a patio to the kitchen. 

A further patio links the drawing room with the master bedroom suite while the guest bedroom is on a raised ground floor with a further guest bathroom and lavatory.

The pink theme continues in the patio with pink furniture, pink walls and even a few pink blooms among the greenery

The garden flat in Lennox Gardens, Knightsbridge SW1 is awash with pinkery from walls to furniture. It can be yours for £1.7million plus a few thousand more a year on ground rent and service charge
