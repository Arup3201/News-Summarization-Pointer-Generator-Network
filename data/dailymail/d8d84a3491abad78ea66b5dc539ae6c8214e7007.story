Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh, held in a Dubai prison without charge for more than nine months, is making progress in his fight against his former colleagues at Dubai-based Islamic Investment bank GFH Capital, who are still 25 per cent shareholders at pantomime club Leeds.

Hisham Al Rayes and Jinesh Patel, a Leeds director, are the subject of an application to be heard at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on April 9 that the pair be made the subject of arrest warrants and extradition proceedings on the criminal charge of fraudulently luring Haigh to Dubai on the pretext of the offer of a new London-based job.

Leading human rights lawyer, Alan Jones QC, is heading the case against Al Rayes and Patel.

The FA have appointed Martin Glenn as their new chief executive — and the food industry boss is taking a cut of more than half his salary by moving to Wembley.

Glenn, chief executive of United Biscuits, was earning £1.4million according to the latest accounts, but will receive no more than around £650,000 at the FA.

However, the lure of working at the top of English football was the main incentive for 54-year-old Glenn, who has made plenty of money in top jobs with Walkers, Birds Eye, PepsiCo and United Biscuits — whom he sold to Turkish food group Yildiz as part of a quick turnaround operation since April 2013.

Glenn, known as the ‘Codfather’ of frozen foods after he killed off Captain Birds Eye and introduced Alaska Pollock into fish fingers, will have some notable football allies when he starts at the FA on May 18.

Wolves season-ticket-holder Glenn, a level one football coach, has been a friend of Gary Lineker since he signed him for the Walkers Crisps ads that have been running since 1994. And Glenn was on the board at Leicester City at the same time as Greg Clarke, chairman of the Football League.

Such was the secrecy around Glenn’s appointment that the selection panel only informed the rest of the FA board about their choice late on Thursday night, before the announcement at 10am yesterday.

And for once, it looks like the FA have selected wisely with Glenn described by pal Lineker as an ‘inspired choice, a genuine football fan, terrific leader, great bloke. Gets things done.’ Praise indeed.

However, the FA could have appointed Glenn 10 years ago when he was understood to be interested in the job. Instead, it went to TV sports chief Brian Barwick.

Channel Five and the Football League, who have a contract for a 9pm Saturday highlights show next season, have yet to find a production company to provide the footage. And then comes the task of pulling together a programme featuring all three divisions in such a short space of time. The rival offers from the BBC and ITV only promised Championship highlights. The FL say putting fibre optic connections in all grounds will make life easier. 

The build-up to the Rugby World Cup will last longer than the Olympic torch relay before London 2012

The 2015 Rugby World Cup roadshow in the UK will start 100 days before the tournament — an even longer build-up than the 70-day Olympic torch relay ahead of London 2012. The international leg of the roadshow has demonstrated a big demand to see the trophy because of the craze for sporting selfies — fans wanting a picture of themselves with the World Cup. 

The Football League are understood to be looking into the way Leicester City have stayed within Financial Fair Play regulations, despite declaring a loss of nearly £21m in the last financial year when they gained promotion.

It is unclear how the Foxes kept on the right side of FFP limits that allow a maximum loss of £8m — not offset by football-related activity — partly through a multi-million-pound marketing and licensing deal with Sheffield-based agency Trestellar, capitalising on their Thai owners’ profile in the Far East.

Trestellar is fully owned by former Premier League chairman Sir Dave Richards and his son. Richards was an adviser to the Thais after leaving the PL in 2013.
