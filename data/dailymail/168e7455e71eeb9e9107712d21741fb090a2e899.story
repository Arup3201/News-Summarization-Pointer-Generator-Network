With the average Brit set to consume 7,000 calories on Christmas day, it comes as no surprise that the traditional British Christmas dinner has been ranked the fattiest and unhealthiest in Europe.

A new survey has revealed that our typical festive lunch on December 25 contains 69g fat and 211g of carbohydrates, that's 42 per cent saturated fat and 30 per cent sugar.

On the other end of the spectrum is France, which tops the healthy league table with its menu full of unprocessed foods.

Greedy nation: The traditional British Christmas dinner of roast chicken, roast potatoes and Christmas pudding has been voted the unhealthiest in the whole of Europe

A typical French Christmas dinner may be packed with roast chicken, foie gras and thirteen desserts, but it contains a total of just 46g of fat and 29g of carbohydrates per person, which equates to 24 per cent saturated fat and 31 per cent sugar. 

The 13 puddings represent Jesus and the 12 apostles. They are traditionally set out Christmas Eve and remain on the table three days until December 27.

However unhealthy the idea of 13 desserts may sound, many of the courses consist of nuts, berries and fruit, making it a healthier option than our Christmas pudding drenched in brandy cream.

The Czech Republic came second in the healthy league with their low-fat festive feast, consisting of fish soup, cold potato salad and sour cabbage.

Ireland was voted nearly as unhealthy as Britain but just missed out on the unhealthiest top spot thanks to its starter of prawn cocktail - a higher source of protein.

With its processed and cured meats, Germany was also ranked as one of the unhealthiest nations when it came to Christmas dinner.

Healthy: France's Christmas dinner may be packed with oysters, foie gras and Fougasse bread, but it has been revealed as the healthiest in Europe

A spokesperson for health app Lifesum, who carried out the survey by asking staff at European embassies in London about their native country's festive dishes, said: 'Christmas is a time for eating well and enjoying food, but clearly some European countries have, by accident of tradition, dishes that offer far less reason for diners to feel guilty.

'We hope that some people might be inspired by how their European cousins celebrate the day, and consider incorporating some healthy international food options within their own family meals.'
