Frank Lampard captains England against Costa Rica on Tuesday and will then quit international football despite Roy Hodgson suggesting he still has an international future.

Lampard thinks it is the appropriate time to bow out and will do so having won 106 caps. He has an offer to play in Major League Soccer with New York City next season and that could lead to him playing in the Premier League on loan.

He will finish with just two fewer international caps than his father Frank senior’s West Ham pal and former England captain Bobby Moore.

History boy: Lampard could become England's second youngest scorer at a World Cup if he nets on Tuesday

Lampard’s record of 29 England goals is impressive, although Charlton hit 49 and remains England's top all-time scorer with Wayne Rooney closing the gap on 40.

If Lampard scores on Tuesday he will become the second oldest player to score a goal at World Cup finals for England having turned 36 four days ago.

The oldest was Sir Tom Finney, who scored a late penalty in the 2-2 draw against Soviet Union in 1958 at the age of 36 and 64 days.

Although 
Steven Gerrard has asked for some time to consider his international 
future it is unlikely Roy Hodgson will persuade him to change his mind 
on calling it a day with England.

As it stands Gerrard has 113 caps, two 
behind the most capped outfield player David Beckham. Goalkeeper Peter 
Shilton remains the most capped on 125.

Decision time: Steven Gerrard will consider his international future after the World Cup in Brazil ends

The Luis Suarez 'camp' are now dropping heavy hints that when the World Cup is over he will quit Liverpool with Barcelona and Real Madrid set to battle it out for his services.

A 'shoot out' between the two La Liga against would be appropriate. To his Uruguayan team-mates Suarez is known as 'El Pistolero'...'The Gunfighter.'

In the last four World Cup finals Germany’s Miroslav Klose has scored 15 goals compared to total of 17 by England over the same period.

Whether or not Didier Drogba starts against Greece on Tuesday, he will no doubt have an impact on the game at some stage.

Drogba, who will quit international football at the end of the World Cup, will be determined to make sure that this game is not his last for the Ivory Coast.

Perhaps one of the reasons for his longevity is that the 36-year-old didn’t start a professional career until he was 21 with Le Mans.

High flyer: Didier Drogba may play his last game for the Ivory Coast against Greece on Tuesday

There is a growing feeling that too many young English strikers get burned out because they play far too much at a younger age - take the case of Michael Owen. And there is an argument, endorsed by Paul Scholes, that at 28 Wayne Rooney has already peaked. At the same age Drogba moved into his pomp at Chelsea.

And even a bit of racy lifestyle didn’t seem to harm Drogba. In his early days his team-mates called him 'Tupac' after the America rap because of his penchant for a wild nightlife.

Watch Out for...

Shiniji Kagawa was dropped for Japan’s last game against Greece after a peripheral display in their 2-1 defeat to Ivory Coast in their opening game. 

But Kagawa is set to return on Tuesday 
against Columbia in a game Japan need to win if they want to progress 
from Group C. Japan must also hope Ivory Coast fail to beat Greece.

Centre of attention: Shinji Kagawa is expected to return to Japan's startling line up against Colombia on Tuesday

Kagawa’s career at Manchester United could be revived under Louis van Gaal, but if the Dutchman doesn’t see him as part of his plans then he could return to Borussia Dortmund.

O ....the Japan-Columbia game is at  9pm on BBC 3, Ivory Coast-Greece is on BBC1 at the same time.

I – say :Ahead of an World Cup qualifier against Poland in 1990, Ian Wright once explained with a combination of  Churchillian rhetoric and 'Sarf London Caribbean slang' that England would win because of 'The bulldog spirit, man'.

They did the next night at Wembley when a combination of panache and passion saw England blow Poland apart 3-0.

Such virtues seem very much out of fashion now - laughed off as 'old school' - while the appliance of more and more sports science is seen as the way forward.

But a bloated back room staff of medics, spin and head doctors has hardly succeeded. If anything it’s given the players more excuses and made them more mentally fragile

Indeed when you listen to what makes other countries tick many cite national pride and desire the very qualities that are laughed off by football 'hipsters' in this country. Explaining Spain’s demise Xavi Alonso spoke of a lack of 'hunger'.

When Harry Redknapp suggested that some Tottenham players made excuses NOT to join up with England it raises questions about the motivation of many when it comes to playing for England.

On that front perhaps the FA should find some sort of role for Ian Wright in the camp. On the notion that there are players who duck out of playing for England Wright has said: 'The next young player who says he does not want play for England should be ordered to ring the parents of a soldier who has dies in Afghanistan, and tell him his reasons.'

Well said Wrighty. That’s the bulldog spirit, man.

World Cup Moment:

Belo Horizonte, where England face Costa Rica on Tuesday, is of course the venue of England’s most infamous defeat when they were beaten 1-0 by the USA in 1950.

Shock: England lost to USA 1-0 in 1950 thanks to a goal from GaetJens (right)

At the time England were regarded as the best team in the world with players like Sir Tom Finney and Stan Mortenson - although Stanley Matthews was dropped for the match.

England also lost to Spain 1-0 and were eliminated, although, they did beat Chile 2-1.

The chastening experience suffered is said to have inspired England’s right back at that World Cup  to one day make amends and lift the trophy. His name? Alfred Ramsey.

World Cup Bet:

The patriotic pound has proved very profitable for the bookies at the World Cup.

So it’s difficult to see the attraction of 4/5 on an England win…although Costa Rica are resting players which maybe explains why you can 7/2 on them winning with the draw 11-4.

A romantic punt for first goal scorer is Frank Lampard at 10-1; Joel Campbell is 13-2 to open the scoring for Costa Rica. Uruguay are 13-2 to beat Italy.
