It is the world's most expensive skateboard coated in pure gold and is on sale for a staggering £9,000.

The board has been plated in pure gold and still works normally despite its precious paint job.

According to the board's creator, the lucky buyer will have to wear special gloves to avoid smudging the mirror-finish.

This is the world's most expensive skateboard and is on sale for £9,000

Each of the board's eight components works normally despite being plated in pure gold

The board was created for New York skateboard shop SHUT by designer Matthew Willet.

He said it was important that the skateboard was fully functional especially because of the price tag. 

As a result, all six of the components are in working order despite being electroplated in gold and weighing 80 percent more than a traditional board.

After each component was covered in gold it was hand polished to a mirror finish.

This means that the lucky buyer will have to wear special cotton archival gloves to avoid damaging the surface.

However, the gold plating means the board is 80 percent heavier than a normal board and may make it more difficult to control

Mr Willet said: 'The board took a lot of trial and error, but it the end came out amazing and everyone learned a lot.

'The process is top secret, but we now know what we are capable of.

'I've been skateboarding my whole life so making this was kind of a no brainer.

'People have been really excited about the board as well - we've had some great responses and a lot of interest.

'When you are in the same room as the board, you can't miss its glowing effect.'

The board has been created by SHUT skateboards in New York who came up with a top-secret process to coat the board in gold

Although the new buyer is warned that they will need special gloves if they do not want to damage the board's mirror finish
