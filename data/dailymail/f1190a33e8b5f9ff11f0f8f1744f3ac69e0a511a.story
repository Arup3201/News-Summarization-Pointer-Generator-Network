It could have made him a billionaire – well, even more of a billionaire than he already was.

But when Bill Gates’s engineers brought him an e-reader in 1998, he told them to forget about the ‘unimportant’ device.

The Microsoft founder rejected the gadget, which featured a touchscreen, because he thought the future lay with keyboards.

Today, most modern gadgets eschew physical keys for touchscreens – although the original Amazon Kindle, which has fuelled the e-book boom, did indeed include a keyboard.

Ouch: Microsoft founder Bill Gates (left) dismissed the idea of a touchscreen e reader like the Amazon Kindle (right) in 1998, but the devices have since become a multi-billion pound industry

A programmer involved in Microsoft’s 
e-reader project told US magazine Vanity Fair that Gates also complained
 about the device’s interface ‘because it didn’t look like Windows’, the
 operating system that made him his fortune.

The comments were made for an upcoming
 story about the 'downfall' of Microsoft, which is scheduled to hit 
newsstands later this month.

The gadget was dismissed as ‘unimportant’, and the engineers working on it were told to come up with something else instead.

The e-book market in the UK alone is 
now worth an estimated £243million, with digital revenues accounting for
 8 per cent of all book sales last year.

Years later, Microsoft engineers also 
failed to see the potential in Instant Messaging on the Internet, which 
has now become incredibly popular.

One engineer failed to see why people 
would just want to write a few words on screen - which is exactly the 
formula Twitter has used to become a success.

Short-sighted: Gates, pictured here in 1995, turned his nose up at a touch-screen device because he wanted everything to go through Microsoft Office, which used a keyboard

Cashing in: The fortunes of Microsoft are in stark contrast to those of Apple, which under Steve Jobs (pictured) took a leap of faith with touchscreen products such as the iPhone and the iPad (above). The iPhone now makes more money than all of Gates' products combined

Gates'
 decision puts him among a circle of business leaders who have made bad 
decisions which have looked so bad in hindsight they have become 
comical.

Among them is 
former Decca A&R man Dick Rowe who famously said no to The Beatles 
in 1962 and claimed 'Guitar groups are on their way out'.

In
 1876, William Orton, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company, 
wrote a letter to inventor Alexander Bell rejecting his invention 
because it was a 'toy' with 'no commercial possibilities'.

The invention in question was the telephone.

Microsoft's
 fortunes are in sharp contrast to those of Apple which until his death 
last year was led by Steve Jobs, who was considered far more willing to 
take risks than Gates.

Nowadays, Apple's iPhone makes more money than all of Microsoft’s products combined.

Ironically,
 Amazon's Kindle e-reader, which launched in 2007 and is now the most 
successful in the world, did not come with a touch screen and had an 
in-built keyboard and small joystick to navigate around the screen.

Worst decision ever: Gates is not alone in making regretful knock-backs after former Decca A&R man Dick Rowe famously said no to The Beatles in 1962 and claimed 'guitar groups are on their way out'

Just a 'toy': In 1876, William Orton, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company, rejected Alexander Bell's telephone invention (above) because it had 'no commercial possibilities'
