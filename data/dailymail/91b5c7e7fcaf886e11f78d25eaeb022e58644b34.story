The father of bashing victim Josh Hardy is said to be ‘full of forgiveness', asking that a candle is also lit for his son's alleged killer, because  will also be changed forever’.

Melbourne university student, 21-year-old student, was killed last Saturday when he was brutally bashed  outside a McDonald’s in St Kilda, in what is believed to have been an unprovoked attack.

Investment banker Kyle Zandipour, 26, has been charged with Mr Hardy's murder following the incident where '[Mr Hardy] was grabbed by the arm and violently thrown to the ground head first, and then kicked to the head,’ according to Detective Sergeant Sol Solomon.

He lapsed into unconsciousness immediately and was taken to Alfred Hospital, where he died from his injuries an hour later.

Hardy’s father, David, has shown mercy and compassion for both Kyle Zandipour and the man who accompanied Zandipour before the attack. 

The man was identified by CCTV footage and provided a statement for police, but will not face charges.

The victim's father is concerned for the men and their families, according to a report from the headmaster of Melbourne Grammar School, Roy Kelley.

Josh Hardy, originally from Darwin, completed Year Twelve at Melbourne Grammar School in 2011, where the Aboriginal flag is currently flying at half mast in memoriam.

The headmaster published a reflection after learning of the former Grammar student’s tragic death, describing a conversation he had with David Hardy.

‘I (had)… the difficult task of returning to my office to telephone the parents of Josh Hardy… who had been tragically killed over the weekend,’ wrote Mr Kelley.

‘His father, David and I shared memories of Josh which resulted in the expected mix of tears and laughter.’

Joshua's family has paid an emotional tribute to their beloved son who was killed suddenly, and are campaigning to raise awareness about the devastating impact of violence

However, Mr Kelley explained that the ‘most remarkable’ part of the conversation came from the ‘incredibly humane reaction’ Mr Hardy had when he asked for special favour.

‘In stating that I was going to leave my office to go to the Chapel of St Peter to light a candle for Josh and his family, he asked for a special favour.

‘He asked me to also light a candle for the two men who were responsible for Josh’s death and for their families, given the fact their lives would also now be affected forever, just as his had been.’

The headmaster says the father was ‘full of forgiveness’ for the perpetrators of the heinous crime.

‘He could well have been forgiven for venting strong feelings of the need for revenge, yet it was clear… that he was full of forgiveness, despite what had happened to his son.’

The message was shared on the ‘Justice4JoshHardy’ Facebook page, which ‘is designed to share thoughts on how something positive can come from the tragic and senseless act of violence that killed Josh Hardy.’

Messages of support poured in, responding to the sentiments shared by Mr Hardy’s father.

Joshua (second from left) has been remembered as a keen sportsman and a leader, inspiring the indigenous students he cared for as an AIME mentor at university

‘Beautiful words. No wonder Josh was so well respected & loved when he was being guided by such amazing parents (& family) ,’ wrote Kelly McSkimming.

‘In times like these it's usually your friends & family that give you strength, but I feel that the strength and love being shown by David, Milly, Bec and all their families is what is helping us all get through this tragic time.’

Earlier this week, David Hardy implored every person to reach out to their loved ones, saying, ‘ring your family and tell that that you love them.’

“We know that was the last thing we said to Josh before the stupid night,’ he told Nine News.

‘It’s a senseless act of violence that has cut short a very special young man’s life,” he said, according to Herald Sun.

Josh Hardy’s devastated loved ones continue to pay tribute to him, and are campaigning to raise awareness about the devastating impact of violence.

‘How do we make sense of this tragic loss, violently kicked and stomped, to death??? ... We can't, at all!!!,’ wrote his uncle.

An third-year Arts student and popular football player, Joshua Hardy has been described by friends on social media as 'a truly genuine, spirited and kind-hearted young man'

‘Perhaps, if anything, as men, women, and children, we can condemn all violence, reinforce that every action has consequences, some can be fatal, and tell our children that we love them!’ 

Just hours before his death Mr Hardy had been celebrating the end of semester with his beloved sister, Rebecca, a precious last moment captured in a photograph of their beaming faces.

They siblings shared a close bond, both living away from their hometown of Darwin at the Melbourne University residence, Trinity College.

'Rest easy my precious xx' Ms Hardy wrote on Facebook, alongside the photograph of the pair together on their last night together.

Mr Hardy's loved ones desperately want to make changes so the streets are safe and other families do not have to experience the same devastating loss.

The Justice for Josh Hardy campaign hopes to raise awareness and educate people, to ensure no one else has to experience the loss of a loved one from a 'random assault'.

'We need to educate our school age sons to use words rather than fists or feet.

'We need our young men to understand that thoughtless actions can have very final and devastating consequences.'
