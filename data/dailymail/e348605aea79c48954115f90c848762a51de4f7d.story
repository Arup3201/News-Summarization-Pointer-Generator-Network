Heartbreak: Friends and family of little Antonia Candelaria, pictured, laid her to rest today as the funerals for victims of Monday's tornado get underway

A nine-year-old girl who 'found the positive, good and joy in everything' was laid to rest today after she was killed in the arms of her best friend when the Oklahoma tornado struck their school.

Nicknamed 'Ladybug' by her family, little Antonia Candelaria is one of seven children who perished at the Plaza Towers Elementary in Moore. Her closest friend, fellow third-grader Emily Conatzer, was with her — a source of solace for her parents.

Antonia's funeral was the first of three to be held in the next two days for children who died in Monday's storm, which claimed a total of 24 lives and damaged or destroyed 13,000 homes in the Oklahoma City suburb.

Ironically,
the heavens opened as family and friends hurried into a chapel where 
mournful country songs played and photos of a beaming Antonia filled the
foyer on Thursday.

Her mother, Brandie Candelaria, said that knowing her 'beautiful young lady' was in the arms of her best friend when she died was comforting for her family.

'I
know Tonia and Emily were together and holding hands and taking care of
each other,' the distraught woman said according to Moore Schools 
Superintendent Susan Pierce, after learning of her daughter's death.

In a tear-jerking obituary in The Oklahoman, the family described Antonia as a happy girl who loved life and the people around her, always 'dancing to her own drum.'

'She was a beautiful young lady on the inside and out,' her mother wrote. 'She
had her own most special and beautiful way of looking at the world. She
could find the positive, good and joy in everything.'

She remembered her daughter as someone 'specially gifted in art as well 
as music' and said she 'loved to draw, paint, color and make crafts.'

Of Antoni and Emily, she wrote: 'They were inseparable, even in their last moments, they held on to one another 
and followed each other into Heaven and they will never be alone.

'We
will miss our precious little Ladybug everyday but will rejoice for the
day we will be reunited with her again someday,' the obituary 
concluded.
