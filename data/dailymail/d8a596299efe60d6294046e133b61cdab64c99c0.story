Apple has unveiled its Watch today in what is the company's first completely new product since the death of founder Steve Jobs. 

A press event held in San Francisco revealed the collection that will range in price from $349 to $17,000 (£299 to £13,500 in the UK). 

It comes in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, and all are sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions.

The devices are due to go on sale on April 24, but how do they compare to rivals' smartwatches? And can Apple crack the market that has only seen limited sales to date? 

Here MailOnline looks at its main competitors in the increasingly crowded market. 

Apple's Watch is available in three models: the Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition (shown) and all models will be sold in 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions. Apple Watch is made of stainless steel, Sport is made of Aluminum and the premium Edition comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold

Moto 360

The Moto 360 watch launched in September 2014 and won praise for its stylish, circular design that was seen as being a move away from the bulky and computerised-looking Pebble Steel, Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch. 

It features a 1.5in LCD touchscreen encircled by a thin metal band and is powered by Google's Android Wear operating system. 

The Moto 360 - which is available now in the US - is also $100 cheaper than the Apple Watch. 

Despite its impressive design and promises that the watch lasts for 24 hours, tests have shown this averages at around 12 - six hours less than the Apple Watch and almost two days shorter than the Samsung Gear S. 

Like with Apple's Watch, batter life depends on usage.  

The device reviews at the time of its launch were mixed. 'Like all other watches in this class, you'll have to get used to charging every night, and occasionally you'll need to top off during the day,' wrote Android Central. 

'The display resolution isn't as good as other choices. And the Android Wear software itself is still is in its infancy.'

The Moto 360 launched last year and is available for $250 in the US and £199 in the UK

Samsung Gear S

Samsung - the world's biggest smartphone manufacturer - was early to launch a range of smartphones to counter slow earnings in its mobile sector. 

This included the Samsung Galaxy Gear that was released in September 2013. 

Despite their early foray into the market, their appeal and functionality was limited and the Galaxy Gear was too big for even the largest wrists.  

The Samsung Gear S was unveiled in August 2014 

Its new watch is called the Gear S and has a larger curved AMOLED screen than its predecessors at two inches (5cm). It is designed to fit more comfortably on the wearer's wrist than its previous models.

The watch is large enough so that users will be able to read messages and notifications at a glance. The screen can be customised – as well as the colour of the straps.

It offers 3G, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, so that users can receive notifications from social networks, calendars and apps, without needing to use their smartphone.

People wearing the device can reply to messages by using an onscreen keyboard or 'S voice functionality' so they can dictate a message.

Engineer and tech expert Sami Mughal from OxGadgets told MailOnline: 'Apple are Marmite at the moment; you either love them or hate them.

'Most Android fans fall in the latter category, and they'll probably go straight for anything that comes with the Samsung badge on it.' 

The watch is the cheapest on the market at $199 and has an impressive battery life of two to three days, meaning users do not have to charge their watch every night. 

However, the watches run on Tizen OS, a fledgling mobile operating system, rather than Google's Android software.  

LG G watch R 

LG joined Motorola as the latest manufacturer to release a smartwatch with a round face in September last year. 

It runs Android Wear, has a 1.3in diameter touchscreen and comes with 4GB of storage.  

As well as being waterproof, the watch features a heart-rate sensor on the rear, but doesn't have a GPS sensor. 

It connects to any Android phone running 4.3 or higher, via Bluetooth, and can also be controlled using voice commands. 

At $332 it is more expensive than the Moto 360 and the Samsung Gear S, but is still cheaper than the Apple Watch. 

'Android Wear needs more work,' said John McCann at TechRadar. 'It feels odd talking to your wrist and the price tag is hard to swallow. 

The LG Watch R is available with a choice of two straps, the first is made from leather, while the second is a metallic-link strap

Huawei watch 

The Huawei Watch is powered by Android Wear, has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and comes with a built-in heart rate monitor.

The crown, frame and hinge are made of scratch-resistant stainless steel and there will be 40 watch faces to choose from when it launches later this year. 

The watch will be available later this year across Europe, Asia and the US although the exact date and price information has not been announced. 

The 1.4-inch display has a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels, giving it a 286 pixel-per-inch (PPI) density.

By comparison, the Moto 360 which also has a circular screen has a PPI of 205.

PPI is an indicator of image sharpness, clarity and colour and the higher the number, the better. 

The firm has not yet revealed battery life details but said it would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with the device. 

Last week, MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston tested the gadget at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

'The screen is bright and clear, but its size and the fact it is predominantly used to show notifications means there is little added benefit to this,' she said.

'There will be a range of straps available when the watch launches and I can see it being popular with both sexes. Previous watches such as the Moto 360 feel more masculine, for example.

'Huawei would not be drawn on battery life or pricing and these will be key to its success, but it is certainly the most stylish and luxurious smart watch I’ve seen.'
