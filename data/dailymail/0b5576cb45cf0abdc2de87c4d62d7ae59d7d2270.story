An Oklahoma man was arrested after being found in a septic tank in a park outhouse.Kenneth Enslow, 52, was discovered by a 7-year-old girl and her mother at about 5pm Sunday when the two went to use the bathroom at a park near Tulsa, OK, heard coughing and saw him looking up at them, according to officials.The two fled the bathroom and called the authorities, who ended up having to fish the peeping Tom out.

Disgusting: Kenneth Enslow, 52, was discovered inside a Tulsa, OK park toilet looking up at unsuspecting park goers while they did their business

By the time officials arrived, Enslow was ‘standing with his head and shoulders out of the hole… covered in feces,’ according to an arrest report filed by the Tulsa County Sheriff’s office.The fire department helped the unemployed degenerate out of the cesspool using rope and hosed him off, literally, with the fire hose, the report said.‘They extracted him with rope and sprayed him off with the hose on the fire truck,’ Stuart Meyer told KOTV, ‘he was covered in defecation and looked like he had been down there for quite some time.’

Enslow first claimed that he was hit over the head with a tire iron, tossed in the back of a 1972 Chevrolet Monte Carlo and dumped there by his girlfriend Angel, according to the report. Enslow claimed he did not ask for help because he was unconscious. After being taken to a local hospital as a precaution, even after officers failed to find injuries consistent with assault from a tire iron, the pervert later admitted he made the story up, according to KJRH.

Tempting: Enslow couldn't resist the urge to hop into the septic tank below the outhouse in a Tulsa park

Relaxing: The park is a haven for locals looking to fish and hike, not to be fished out of the latrine

Explaining that Enslow is not a small man, Meyer said that Enslow ‘had to work to get into that hole… there were claims he was put in that hole by somebody else, I don’t think that happened.’The arresting officer did observe ‘several scratches on [Enslow’s] head, but they were old and had scabbed over,’ the report states. The deviant also had scratches on his arms ‘from the rough edges of the concrete slab.’

White Water Park is a lake situated on a dam just west of Tulsa, OK. It is a popular local fishing and hiking area.Enslow was taken from the hospital to a local jail and charged with being a Peeping Tom, a misdemeanour, a Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson told Mail Online. He is also being held on warrants dating back to 1998 for embezzlement and illegal dumping in Okmulgee County, a spokesperson from that county’s sheriff’s office told Mail Online.

Peaceful: The park usually offers residents a respite from the stresses of everyday life

This is not Enslow's first run-in with the fuzz, he has also been arrested for public intoxication and driving under suspension, arrest records show, according to KOTV.Despite the septic swimmer being locked up for now, Meyer isn’t taking any chances.‘To think that there’s somebody down in the bottom watching you is plumb scary,’ Meyer told KOTV, ‘we’ll take a flashlight and look below first, I don’t want to see anybody scuba diving in the toilet.’
