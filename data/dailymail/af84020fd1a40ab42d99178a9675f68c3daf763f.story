Thibaut Courtois has attacked his Belgium team-mates and called for players to be dropped ahead of their clash with Wales.

Belgium beat Iceland 3-1 in a friendly on Wednesday but were vulnerable in defence and required the Chelsea goalkeeper to pull off a string of saves to keep them ahead. 

Courtois claimed that Wales, spearheaded by Gareth Bale, would crush his country if they repeat the performance in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday. 

Thibaut Courtois was not pleased with Belgium's 3-1 win over Iceland on Wednesday night

The Chelsea stopper has warned his team-mates Wales could 'crush' them if they don't improve

‘I don’t think we should be happy with the 3-1 victory,’ he said. ‘We created a lot of chances, but we also gave away a lot of space.

‘Some players weren’t doing their defensive job. If we play like this on Sunday against Wales, we’ll get crushed.

‘That’s what I told the manager straight after the game. I told him who didn’t do their job. I know it was only a friendly, but the guys should always be willing to run. If not, then they should be put on the bench.’ 

Afterwards, he came back and added context to his quotes. ‘I’m not having a go at my defenders, I’m talking about the whole team. Because a good defence starts in front. I just want what’s best for the group and for Belgium.’

Manager Marc Wilmots said the 22-year-old should have kept his complaints in-house but also offered words of protection.

Courtois and his team mates will face a Gareth Bale-powered Wales side in their European qualifier 

‘Maybe he should’ve kept that criticism inside the group, but it’s no problem for me. He was coming right off the pitch and was still pumped up.’

Courtois may have to make further saves against Wales, with Bale eager to earn his side a positive result. The last time the pair faced each other was the Champions League final, when Bale scored a decisive goal in extra time.

‘I hope he does the same,’ said Wales No 1 Wayne Hennessey. ‘Bale is just an unbelievable talent. We’ve all seen how he can punish people and get goals from all angles. He practises all the time and that’s why he’s so good. Courtois will have done his homework on Bale.’

Bale tried his hand in goal during Wales training in Cardiff this week – but Hennessey is not having any sleepless nights. 

‘I wouldn’t be threatened if I saw him in goal,’ laughed the Crystal Palace goalkeeper. ‘But I’m sure he’s not a bad keeper. He probably fancies himself. He can play any position on the field.’

There is an additional Courtois quote worth including, can we weave in on point that if Belgium defend badly again Bale will punish...

'Bale is very fast and there must be at least one defender back. We need to be careful.'
