A young British backpacker died after drinking poisonous methanol labelled as gin during a holiday of a lifetime.

Cheznye Emmons, 23, was served the deadly spirit while visiting an orangutan sanctuary in the jungle of Indonesia as part of a trip around south-east Asia with boyfriend Joe Cook, 21.

The following day, the beautician woke up unable to see and was put through a tortuous journey out of the jungle – travelling by rickshaw and  taxi to reach a hospital five hours away.

Terrifying: Cheznye Emmons tragically died after drinking from a bottle labelled 'gin' that later turned out to be filled with deadly methanol

Trip of a lifetime: The 23-year-old had been travelling across south Asia with her boyfriend Joe Cook, 21, and a male friend the couple had met on their travels when they bought the tainted alcohol from a local shop in Indonesia

Doctors put her in an induced coma as
they battled to save her from the effects of methanol poisoning – 
blindness, kidney damage and seizures.

Mr Cook, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, 
who survived the poisoning, broke the news to her parents, Pamela and 
Brenton, who flew out to be at her  bedside at the Columbia Asia 
Hospital in Medan.

But Mr and Mrs Emmons were told there
was nothing doctors could do and their daughter’s life-support was 
switched off five days after the poisoning.

The methanol had been poured into a 
bottle labelled as gin and sold in a local shop in the popular tourist 
site of Bukit Lawang in northern Sumatra.

Dangers: Methanol is extremely poisonous and is known to cause kidney failure, blindness, seizures and death- as little as 30ml can be deadly for an adult

Family: Miss Emmons called Chez by her friends, is the youngest of four siblings

Difficult: On April 25, Miss Emmons' parents Pamela and Brenton made the heart-breaking decision to turn off her life support after flying out to be with her

Deadly: Within days the beauty therapist, from Great Wakering, Essex, complained of not being able to see and was rushed to the nearest eye clinic

Alcoholic drinks contain pure alcohol, known as ethanol, but not methanol.

Methanol is a toxic chemical component that can be used for fuel, as an ingredient in formaldehyde, plastics and paints or as an anti-freeze or solvent.

In recent years cheap homemade local alcohol and even apparent international brand name spirits are being contaminated with methanol - a poison you can’t taste or smell.

High taxes have pushed up prices of manufactured wine, beer and spirits in the Muslim country encouraging a long-standing practice of stretching spirits with the locally made spirit known as arak – but some immoral suppliers are going further, adulterating those local spirits with the poisonous methanol.

In 2009 two Britons were among 25 people to die in Indonesia after drinking palm wine spiked with methanol.

Alan Cole, 59, and Rose Johnson, 48, died in separate incidents after consuming traditional arak. Rachel Craig, 22, from Ireland and her boyfriend Rene Puper, 23, who was Dutch, were also among the dead.

In June last year Swede Johan Lundin, 28, was poisoned by a mojito laced with methanol. His fiancee, Michaela Pechac, watched in horror as he died.

In December an Australian schoolgirl was blinded after drinking a tainted cocktail while on a trip to Bali. An 18-year-old boy was also temporarily blinded during a trip to Bali in November.

In February 19 year-old Liam Davies from Perth died a vodka mixer was laced with methanol in Lombok.

Miss Emmons’ brother Michael, 33, 
said the family were still in shock and struggling to come to terms 
with  his sister’s death. They are demanding an investigation.

‘From what we understand, the shop 
would have poured the gin out of the original bottle and then replaced 
it with methanol,’ he said. ‘It was in the original bottle with the gin 
label on it.

‘The shop which sold the alcohol has 
been shut down and there’s a police investigation. We just hope it 
doesn’t get swept under the carpet like some of these things do.’

The family are desperate to warn young Britons of the dangers of buying alcohol while travelling to remote spots.

Miss Emmons’ father, 47, a builder, said: ‘I would not want anyone to go through what we have been through.

‘If we can save the life of  just one
traveller by warning them of the dangers of poisoned alcohol then 
something good will have come out of this terrible tragedy.

‘Cheznye was the apple of my eye. She
was my little girl and I am never going to see her again. She was a ray
of sunshine that would light up any room that she walked into.’

Miss Emmons from Great  Wakering, Essex, had two sisters, Bianca, 34, and Measha, 26, who said:

‘We don’t want this to happen to anyone else and I know Chez wouldn’t have wanted to die in vain.’

High taxes have pushed up the price 
of recognised brands of wine, beer and spirits in Indonesia, encouraging
a long-standing practice of stretching drinks with the locally made 
brew known as arak.

Some suppliers are going further, 
adulterating spirits with methanol, which is colourless.

Earlier this 
year, an Australian teenager died after drinking vodka that had been 
mixed with methanol on the Indonesian island of Lombok.

And in 2009, 25 people died in Bali after drinking a batch of arak that was tainted with  the spirit.

Methanol, which is also called methyl
alcohol, is used in numerous industrial applications, including the 
production of formaldehyde, acetic acid and as a fuel component.

Mr Cook, who had been with Miss Emmons for more than three years, has been left devastated by her death.

‘I feel so lost and empty,’ he said in a message posted on the internet.

Death: After falling illl Miss Emmons trekked through the jungle to get help. She was referred to a hospital in Medan, Sumatra, where she was placed in an induced coma and later died

A family friend said the couple had been saving for months for the trip, which he described as a ‘holiday of a lifetime’.

They had begun their journey in Thailand and planned to keep travelling ‘for as long as the money lasted’.

The couple had danced at ‘Full Moon’ parties in Thailand, scaled cliffs, ridden  elephants, and seen tigers and orangutans.

Friends have offered tributes to 
Cheznye via a Facebook page dedicated to her memory.

Sabrina Craven 
said: ‘When I think of you, all I can think of is that million-dollar 
smile and infectious laugh.

‘You were taken way too  soon and have left us all with heavy hearts.’

Devastated: Miss Emmons, with brother Michael. He said: 'We're all just in shock. 'We just hope it doesn't get swept under the carpet like some of these things do'
