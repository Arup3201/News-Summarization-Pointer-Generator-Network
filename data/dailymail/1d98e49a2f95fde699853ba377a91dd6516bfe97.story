They may dress like lumberjacks, but not all of Brooklyn's gentrifying hipster population are twenty-somethings from the Midwest .

As pointed out by Business Insider, the U.S. Census Bureau's 'flows mapper' shows from where in the U.S. new Kings County residents originate.

The patches of yellow are the counties with a significant Brooklyn emigrant population, ages 20-24 and 25-29.

The little yellow spots can be seen all across the U.S., with only noticeable density in the Northeast.

They come from as far away as Hawaii, but mostly from other large cities.

Yellow spots cover the counties that include Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Seattle, and the large cities of Texas.

Virginia Smith, of Brooklyn's The L Magazine, believes this map should dispel the stereotype that most hipsters come from the Midwest and are largely supported by their parents.

'If you look around you, the rich kids whose parents may or may not be subsidizing their Williamsburg rent aren't, as a rule, the gentle-hearted transplants who just hopped off the bus from Chillicothe with dreams of the big city or whatever.'

This isn't the first time that geography has been used to track the movements of New York's hipster population.

Yelp made a heat map that colored areas of New York where reviewers used the word 'hipster' often.

The 'hottest' areas for hipsters were the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and Manhattan's East Village and Lower East Side.
