A ‘possessed’ woman who was beaten with a walking stick in a home exorcism successfully begged a judge not to jail her husband even though he planned the black magic ceremony, a court heard today.

Asma Hussain, 50, was tied to a bed, whipped and doused with holy water after family members became convinced her body was filled with demons.

Wheelchair-bound Ahmed Hussain, 60, instigated the exorcism by a local Muslim imam and encouraged him to hit his wife harder 'to beat the demon out', Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

But today he was spared jail after his forgiving wife Asma asked for his freedom and said: 'It would be the end of my life if Ahmed lost his liberty.'

Convicted: Asma Hussain loyally pushed her husband Ahmed in a wheelchair today after she begged a judge not to jail him for plotting her home exorcism

Holy water was also thrown on Mrs 
Hussain during the eight-hour ordeal, also witnessed by Hussain’s son, 
Mohammed Kayes Hussain, 28, and son-in-law Mohammed Aziz, 21.

Hussain was given a 12-month prison sentence suspended for two years and will also be supervised for a year.

Mohammed Kayes Hussain was jailed for 12 months while Aziz was locked up for nine months.

Asma suffered injuries to her hands and face including a bloody nose, and her back was described as ‘one massive bruise’ after the cruel attack, last January 7.

But Mrs Hussain was unwilling to give evidence against her husband.

She continues to play the role of husband’s loyal servant throughout the trial - pushing him to and from the court house in a wheelchair.

Assault:

taking part in the attack while a judge advised a jury not to convict 
her daughter Salma, 22, (right) who had also faced charges

Mrs Hussain made an impassioned plea to Judge Neil Sanders urging him to be merciful when sentencing her husband and son.

'I don't believe Ahmed can cope with life if he loses 
his liberty,' she wrote.

'Any prison sentence for Ahmed would be a prison sentence for me.

'It would be the end of my life if Ahmed lost his liberty.'

‘Mohammed Kayes has always been a good son and has shown me nothing but love and respect.

‘My family has already been blown apart by these proceedings.

‘Since his father’s health has declined considerably, I need my son’s help.

‘The fact is I have no one else to rely upon. In sending him to prison, it is me who will be punished.’

Family:

while the jury was advised to find her daughter-in-law Halima Khatun 
(left) not guilty

The alarm was raised after another daughter of Mrs Hussain visited and called paramedics, the court heard.

Going home: The judge agreed that Ahmed Hussain needed his wife's care

Mrs Hussain had been suffering from stress due to caring for Ahmed Hussain, which was interpreted by the family as her being possessed, a police spokesperson said.

The imam has mysteriously vanished.

Sentencing, Judge Neil Sanders said: 'During the course of the attack, Mrs Hussain was screaming and was obviously in a great deal of pain.

'I'm quite satisfied that Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Ahmed Hussain were parties to the engagement of the imam.

'I accept that none of you knew the imam was going to resort to violence however by the jury's decision, evidence and having conducted the trial I am quite sure you were all party to this dreadful assault.

'You, Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Mohammed Aziz, held her down while she was being beaten and you, Ahmed Hussain, encouraged the imam in terms of words.

'You ignored the pleas of others who were present to stop what was happening.

'It's clear the imam struck the blows but whatever your beliefs, you were all party to this sustained assault.

'Mrs Hussain was vulnerable at the time, she had been acting strangely in the days leading up to the events but the assistance required was medical.

'I have carefully considered in each case whether I can suspend any sentence of imprisonment.

'In your cases, Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Mohammed Aziz, I have come to the conclusion that the seriousness of this offence merits an immediate sentence of imprisonment.'

Ahmed Hussain, Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Aziz all denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

But a jury of eight women and four men convicted the trio after deliberating for six hours and 24 minutes, following an eight day trial at the court last month.

Allegations: Asma's husband Ahmed, 60, summoned the 
local Muslim preacher to carry out the ceremony and encouraged him to 
hit his wife harder, Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) was told

Prosecutor Babtunde Alabi told the jury the exorcism was performed at the family home in Bethnal Green, east London.

‘It appears that members of Asma Hussain’s family believed she was possessed by demons.

‘They also arranged for an imam to carry out an exorcism on her.

‘During the course of the exorcism, she was held down, had water poured all over her and was beaten with a cane.

‘For some unknown reason, it appears the defendants thought that Asma was possessed by a demon.

‘They claimed her behaviour had changed and her condition had deteriorated over a matter of weeks.

‘Faced with this seeming deterioration, they decided to deal with the matter by spiritual means.

‘Asma was tied to the bed while the imam prayed,’ Mr Alabi added.

‘The imam started beating Asma with her husband’s walking stick.

‘This was done, apparently, to "beat the demon out”.'

Ahmed Hussain, who sat outside the dock throughout the draped in a blanket due to his disability, refused to give evidence.

Wearing traditional Muslim attire, Mohammed Kayes Hussain, who has previous convictions for drugs, dishonesty and assaulting a sister, also did not take to the witness box.

Earlier, Judge Sanders directed the jury to clear the three men, together with Ahmed Hussain’s daughter, Salma, 22, and daughter-in-law Halima Khatun, 28, of false imprisonment.

Salma Hussain and Khatun were also acquitted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the judge’s direction.
