Accused: David Carrender, 49, allegedly killed his son by shooting him six times after a fight over watching football

A father is accused of killing his son after an argument over watching football escalated into a deadly shooting spree.

David Carrender, 49, allegedly shot his 19-year-old son, Wyatt Carrender, six times at the family home, in Martinsville, Indiana.

The two men had been out together watching a football match at a restaurant or bar, according to Morgan County Sheriff Robert Downey, quoted in the IndyStar.com.

The pair started arguing about whether to leave or not - the father wanted to stay, but the son wanted to go home, the Sheriff said.

According to the news service, the father had allegedly been drinking and once the family got home, the two men continued their fight.

'It appears the father retrieved a handgun and shot his son, it appears, six times,' Sheriff Downey told the local new service.

At the time of the shooting, the father's and son's girlfriends were with them, Downey told the IndyStar.com.

David Carrendar, of Crooked Creek Drive, 
Morgan County, has no previous arrest record, the news service said.Â 

Although his son's vehicle was registered at a Bloomington, Morgan 
County address, it is thought he had been living with his father.
