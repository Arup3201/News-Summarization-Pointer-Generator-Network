Six teenagers have been charged in connection with the sexual assault of an incapacitated 15-year-old girl at a party earlier this month in Seneca, South Carolina.

The Oconee County Sheriff's Office is investigating the charges against the six, who include four juveniles.

Investigators said the school resource officer at West-Oak High School received an anonymous tip that a student may have been sexually assaulted at the party on October 12.

Deputies said they then met with the victim and noticed visible injuries.

Sheriff's investigators say they're awaiting toxicology tests to determine what caused the girl to be incapacitated. 

The six teens include Brandon Peralta, 17, Tyler Joseph Normandin, 18. The other four – three 16-year-olds and one 15-year-old - haven’t been named because they’re juveniles.

According to warrants, Peralta is accused of engaging in sexual battery ‘using force and/or coercion to accomplish the battery, the defendant knowing or having reason to know that the victim was mentally defective, mentally incapacitated or physically helpless.’

Warrants said Normandin encouraged 'others to commit the felony act of criminal sexual conduct upon a 15 year old victim'

Warrants said Normandin, ‘with the intent that another commit a crime, did entice, advise, invite, order or otherwise encourage others to commit the felony act of criminal sexual conduct upon a 15 year old victim while said victim was mentally incapacitated or physically helpless.’

According to investigators, two others have been charged with Criminal Sexual Conduct – third degree, one with Criminal Sexual Conduct with a minor – 2nd degree, and one with Criminal Sexual Conduct with a minor third degree, but that juvenile will be charged as an adult.

The Oconee County Sheriff’s Office is continuing their investigation.

'The young lady who was assaulted, she did not deserve that to happen regardless of the circumstances. It’s a terrible situation,' said Public Information Officer Jimmy Watt.

He told News4 that there were no parents at the home when the incident happened, because they were out of town.
