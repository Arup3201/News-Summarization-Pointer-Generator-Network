Debra Winch, 44, receives up to 60 spam text messages every day after she was turned down for a payday loan

Highly sensitive financial details from loan applications are being sold to scammers and cold-calling firms, the Mail can reveal.

Details of how much money applicants asked for, why the cash was needed and why the application was rejected are all being stored on lists and traded.

Vulnerable people desperate for cash are then bombarded up to 60 times a day by cold callers and targeted by scammers who have apparently obtained access to the data. The loan records of more than 3,000 applicants were passed to undercover Mail reporters by one data firm.

When the Mail contacted people on the spreadsheet, they said their lives had been made a misery since they applied for the loans. Some said they have been targeted by scammers because their bank details had been made widely available.

Policeman’s wife Debra Winch, 44, receives up to 60 spam text messages every day after she had an application for a £600 payday loan declined. The mother of three has since been conned out of £360 by two companies which knew her bank account details and removed the money without her knowledge.

Afterwards, one of the scammers spoke to her on the phone and said ‘Catch me if you can’ before hanging up. Mrs Winch said: ‘Having a policeman husband and a son who works in security, I try to be careful giving my information, so am upset my information has got into the hands of the wrong people.

‘I haven’t signed any forms and wouldn’t because I don’t know who I’m dealing with. I feel completely violated. It is amazing how much they know about you.’

The loan records were passed to the Mail’s undercover reporters by Birmingham-based firm Targeted Response Direct.

The data – including the applicants’ names, addresses, work details, how much they had tried to borrow, what they wanted the loan for and why it was turned down – was sent to the reporters as a free sample via email in two spreadsheets, neither of which was password protected.

David Billington, a director of Targeted Response Direct, said people kept these records because there was ‘money in it’.

When asked where the information came from, he named four payday loan broker websites: www.little-loans.com, www.supaloans.co.uk, www.gocheaploans.co.uk and www.supafinance.co.uk.

Last night, the City watchdog said such exploitation was unacceptable and vowed to crack down on the firms involved. And the owner of three of the loan sites involved said it had stopped trading in customers’ data after being contacted by the Mail.

Christopher Woolard, the Financial Conduct Authority’s director of strategy and competition, said: ‘This exploitation of consumers – many of whom are vulnerable – is unacceptable. Credit brokers cannot pass on consumers’ data without their knowledge, or charge a fee for broking without their consent.

‘Cracking down on this sort of practice is one of our top priorities. We are currently investigating a number of firms.’

Government adviser and pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann said: ‘Prison sentences and significant fines should be imposed on those who so carelessly profit from sales of such data.

‘This is a major threat to the British public. It is clear that data protection is failing and supposed protections are simply not working.’

Stephen Eckersley, head of emforcement at the Information Commissioner’s Office, said: ‘Our research has shown people consider their financial data to be the most sensitive information they own. We are also aware that many people who apply for payday loans are often in vulnerable financial positions.

‘The ICO works constantly to target rogue businesses and individuals that seek to profit from the unscrupulous trade in personal data. We will be looking at this information brought to us by the Daily Mail, consider whether there have been any breaches of the Data Protection Act and what action should be taken.’

Mr Billington, who is seen in pictures online posing in pubs and with people dressed as cartoon characters, told an undercover reporter that people so in debt they cannot get a payday loan were a great business opportunity.

‘If you can find somebody and get them into an IVA or a debt management plan, then there’s money in it,’ he said, adding that after two or three years there was ‘always the opportunity to sell them other products’.

The owner of three of the loan sites involved said it had stopped trading in customers’ data after being contacted by the Mail following the revelations over cold-calling

He said he had previously made good money selling on the names of people who were about to lose their homes.

The names had come from a court employee and were then sold t on for up to £5 each as ‘leads’ to firms looking to target those in financial difficulty, he said.

‘It was a great data set,’ Mr Billington added. ‘It was people who were basically being forced out… who were facing repossession.’

Payday loan firms vowed to stop passing on data on their customers after being contacted by the Mail.

Mediablanket Ltd, which owns supaloans.co.uk, supafinance.co.uk and gocheaploans.co.uk, admitted it has passed on data to other companies looking to target people needing money, in exchange for a percentage of revenue from any resulting sales.

Director Anthony Bradley said: ‘I tried to call Targeted and they are not answering the phone. I’ve got no idea who they are, none whatsoever. I’ve never dealt with them direct in my life.

‘I have no idea where they have got our data from, which is a concern. From today, we stopped our data going everywhere.’

The boss of Digitonomy Ltd, which owns little-loans.com, denied selling customers’ data, before putting the phone down when questioned further.

Gary Solomon, 41, said: ‘I can’t make any comment, I’m afraid. We don’t sell any data on and that’s the end of the conversation.’

Targeted Response Direct Ltd denied any wrongdoing, saying everyone on the spreadsheet had given consent for their details to be passed on.
