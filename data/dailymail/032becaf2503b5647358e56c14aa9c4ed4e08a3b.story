Brendan Rodgers and Manuel Pellegrini questioned the state of the Yankee Stadium pitch following Liverpool’s shootout victory over Manchester City in New York.

City’s Major League Soccer team New York City will play in the iconic stadium when they launch next year, but at times on Wednesday night the players struggled to keep their footing on the sandy turf that had been laid over the baseball quadrant in one corner of the pitch.

Rodgers could not help joking when asked about the state of the surface. ‘I thought three-quarters of it was excellent,’ said the Liverpool boss.

‘There was a patch over on the right-hand side which I presume might be where the pitcher stands. But I thought you saw a very good game of football.’ 

Pellegrini admitted that the surface was too dry, saying: ‘Maybe it was not the best pitch to play football, but it wasn’t so bad. We didn’t have any problems with the players.

‘It would be better to play with the pitch in better condition and maybe more wet. Maybe it was a little bit dry and that’s why the ball didn’t run so fast, but there wasn’t any problem for both teams.’ 

Meanwhile, Rodgers challenged Jordan Henderson to hit double figures for the season after seeing him score Liverpool’s first goal in a 2-2 draw. The England midfielder was also on target in the penalty shootout as he gave a man-of-the-match performance.

Asked if Henderson needs to produce more goals, Rodgers said: ‘Yes, I think that was the objective when I spoke to Jordan this year because he has the quality. That finish for the equaliser, he does that day in day out in training. He’s so fit and strong, and such a team player, he does a lot of unselfish work for the team, but this year we’re asking him to get into the box more.

‘I thought he had more opportunities when he played just round the corner in the last 20 minutes and then he was able to time his runs forward better going forward. He got in a few times and was unlucky. That’s his strength. He can really penetrate the defensive line and he’s an athlete who can run all day.

‘I would expect him to get upwards of 10 goals this season because he has the quality and the tactical nous to arrive in the areas to do that.’ 

Rodgers was delighted with his team’s performance as they came from behind to win after Stevan Jovetic twice put City ahead. Victory in Saturday’s last game against AC Milan in Charlotte, North Carolina, will guarantee Liverpool a place in the final of the International Champions Cup in Miami on Monday.

‘I thought overall the players were excellent,’ he said. ‘We scored two goals and could have scored three more. Joe Hart made three outstanding saves. And then we showed composure to finish the penalties.

‘For us at this moment in pre-season it was a great game. Manchester City are a wonderful team and they will go close in the Premier League again this year.

‘What we’re overall is a trademark of this team over the last 18 months and that’s character. Even though it was a pre-season game it was highly competitive, the players showed the character to keep going and come back. It was a really good game.

‘I thought the goals we conceded were unfortunate. Jovetic is very bright and alive in the box. We were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off Steven Gerrard and he got a toe on it. The second goal as well was something similar. We have to respect the quality we were playing against. They’re a top side, one of the best teams in Europe.’ 

Rodgers confirmed that he expects to being in more new signings before next month’s transfer deadline despite a busy summer in the transfer market.

‘We still have some business to do,’ he added. ‘We have some positions that we want to fill so by the end of August we’ll have a strong squad to go forward with.

‘We’ve brought in specific players for specific roles, players who have the profile of how we work. Of course it will them take a bit more time than normal in terms of their induction but the transition has been very smooth.

‘They’re good characters with good personality who fit the criteria we want in terms of the model of our game. That should make the adjustment that bit easier. But of course some of them are young and coming from a different country like Emre Can so that will take a little bit of time.’
