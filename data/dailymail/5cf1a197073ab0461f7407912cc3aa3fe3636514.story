A mother-of-one died after enduring six years of cosmetic surgery to correct facial disfigurement she suffered following a savage beating.

Nicola Davenport, 44, had been punched, kicked, battered with metal sticks and had a plate broken over her head after being caught up in a row at a house party in 2007.

She died a day after being found collapsed at her home in Bolton, Greater Manchester on New Year's Eve last year having suffered a suspected blood clot to the brain.

Due to the injuries she sustained during the attack, Miss Davenport contracted a flesh eating bug which destroyed the skin around her scalp and round her eyes. It left her scarred for life and she had to wear sunglasses to hide her painful scars. 

Over the years Miss Davenport underwent several skin grafts including many to her eyelids but was still having problems with her scalp and she told her family she 'did not want to go on.'

On New Years Eve  she was discovered collapsed at her home by a friend and rushed to hospital in a 'profoundly comatose state' and died the following day.

Police who investigated the beating discovered Miss Davenport's attackers were friends of convicted terrorist leader Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair who fled to the British mainland after being expelled by the Ulster Defence Association in his native Belfast.

Miss Davenport subsequently testified in court over the attack and another woman later went to jail for six months after being convicted of assault. Charges were dropped against two other people.

Today, following an inquest, the dead woman's family blamed Miss Davenport's death on the savage beating she received at one of Adair's hideouts in Troon, Scotland.

Her sister Jay, 33, said: 'She lost her self confidence because of the attack and quite literally never recovered from it. The bug she contracted as a result made it all the much worse.

'She had to have all the skin removed from her face, her nose all the way around to the back of her head and you could nearly see through to the temples.

'She was always in and out of hospital, she said she had had enough and didn't want to go on. It has just been horrendous.'

Her father James, 69, said: 'What happened to Nicola was sickening and she was always blown away by the fact one of her attackers only got six months. 

'It seems her attackers were drugged up and battered her with a steel bar. They then kept her in a bedroom until she was brought back to England. One of these yobs even urinated on her. This attack was so life-changing it must have some connection with her death.

'My daughter was a beautiful clever girl but her condition stopped her from doing things. The operations got too much for her and in some ways it was like she had given up. I don't think she could take it any more even though she was a really strong girl.' 

The beating occurred after Miss Davenport travelled to Ayrshire to attend a party with one of Adair's closest friends. 

At the party, a bust up occurred between Miss Davenport and the friend and later she was set upon by another guest, Jacqueline Irvine, then 44.

Adair himself, who now lives in Scotland, attended the court case to watch Miss Davenport tell how she was punched and kicked by three people until she lost consciousness.

She was brought back to England but she developed an infection of the scalp and after being admitted to Royal Bolton Hospital she was diagnosed as having the flesh eating bug necrotising fascitis.

Her GP Dr Peter Saul told the inquest: 'It causes the bacteria to destroy the skin and in her case the whole of her scalp, the skin was destroyed and to some extent the skin on her upper eye lids.' 

He said Miss Davenport suffered life changing facial injuries and would wear sunglasses to disguise her painful scars.

Over the years she was to undergo a series of operations and had several skin grafts including many her eyelids and was still having problems with her scalp. Dr Saul said that the procedures had been 'very painful.'

The inquest heard that for her daily pain she was prescribed strong painkillers, anti-depressants and was also prescribed Warfarin after developing a Deep Vein Thrombosis, reducing her blood's ability to clot.

Shortly before her death she was said to have complained of headaches, hallucinations and confusion.

When Miss Davenport was later found dying at home, it was first believed that she had been the victim of a serious assault and an investigation was carried out - but any third party involvement was ruled out.

Pathologist Dr Philip Lumb said that her injuries had 'mimicked' a physical trauma but had in fact been as a result of a naturally occurring source like an aneurysm or infection. 

He said her death was caused by intercranal haemorrhage and Warfarin treatment for Deep Vein Thrombosis.

He said: 'Death was caused by bleeding to the brain. I have carefully considered the bleeding to the injuries in 2007 and couldn't find a link between these two events. 

'This is a naturally occurring bleed although I can't be sure what the original source was. The blood was not clotting as it ought to be.'

Assistant coroner Simon Jones returned a conclusion of natural causes.

He added: 'The police were originally concerned when admitted that injuries may have been caused by some form of criminal activity. 

'Her death may have been in some way related to the clearly horrific injuries sustained in 2007 that required her to have very painful operations over many years. 

'The conclusion of Dr Lumb is that neither of these are correct although very badly injured in 2007, that incident has not caused her death nor has she been the subject of any trauma or assault. 

'It was a death at a very young age, a bleed on the brain, that has occurred spontaneously. 

'Warfarin therapy was a contributory factor, when the blood starts it is difficult to stop. She died from natural causes although her death was contributed to by appropriate Warfarin therapy which was required to treat her DVT.'
