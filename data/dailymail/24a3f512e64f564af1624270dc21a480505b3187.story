The wife of a convicted Ponzi scheme fraudster has run into trouble in her attempt to divorce her scamming husband - because he's buried in the federal prison witness protection scheme.

Kim Rothstein, also known as federal inmate 00685-104, first filed for divorce from her husband Scott Rothstein, federal inmate 91256-004, in November but the legal proceedings have hit delays.

It took months to even determine which federal official could serve the divorce papers to the 52-year-old who is being held in a secret location while serving his 50-year prison term for running a $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme.

But further delays have ensued thanks to special security measures at the Bureau of Prisons' Inmate Monitoring Section, which require all airmail be 'held for testing, including radiation testing for security purposes,' Morris wrote.

'We are working under a very unique set of circumstances,' she told the according to the Sun Sentinel on Monday.

'Since Mr. Rothstein is being held in an undisclosed location, we have encountered some difficulty.'

The U.S. Department of Justice program, known as WITSEC, keeps at-risk prisoners completely separate from regular inmates in seven Protective Custody Units at undisclosed locations.

Kim Rothstein, 40, is also in prison, serving 18 months after she admitted to hiding jewelry and other assets from prosecutors and bankruptcy officials.

But she's serving as a regular inmate at a women's facility some four hours fro the couple's former Fort Lauderdale mansion.

Her lawyer Jamie Morris filed records in Broward Circuit Court last week to ask for more time because of the dramas involved in the case.

The request will likely be granted, the Sentinel reports.
