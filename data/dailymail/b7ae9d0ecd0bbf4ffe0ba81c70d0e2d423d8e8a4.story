The days of missing your junction because you were in the wrong lane might be over.

The latest update to the Google Maps app, now available for Android and iOS, has been significantly improved.

And apart from telling you which lane to be in, it has some other nifty new features that will keep you better connected than ever before.

Google has rolled out an update on Android and iOS for its Maps app. Amongst other new features, now when navigating a route the app will tell you what lane to be in, ensuring you don't miss your exit or turning

The first new feature unveiled by Google is the ‘changing lanes’ function.

Google says its driverless cars are mastering California's city streets and could be available by 2017.

They have a fleet of Lexus SUVs retrofitted with lasers, radar and cameras.

The fleet has driven 700,000 accident-free miles (1.1 million kilometres) on motorways.

Google has been focusing on improving city driving for the past year.

So far, the tech giant has focused street driving in Mountain View, California.

But it predicts that the public could get hold of the technology within 3 years.

While following a route on Google Maps, the app will now tell a driver which lane to stay in or move to when they approach a turn.

This should hopefully prevent a person from driving miles down the road in the wrong direction after mission a junction.

Another useful feature is the ability to download maps for offline use.

Although this isn’t entirely new, there way in which it is accessed has been made much simpler.

Now a user only need to tap ‘Save map to use offline’ in a location’s info sheet to view it without an Internet connection.

This will be especially useful if you know you’re heading somewhere with poor signal and no Wi-Fi.

Users can save multiple maps and give each a name to easily navigate through them. They’ll appear by tapping the profile icon by the search icon in the top right corner of the screen.

Clicking on a location and tapping 'Save map to use offline' will now let you store maps of an area for use when you haven¿t got an Internet connection

The new filters feature lets you browse restaurants, bars and hotels according to opening hours, rating, price and more where available to more easily find what you're looking for

Elsewhere, there is an upgrade to Google’s ‘search nearby’ feature.

Now mobile users can browse through restaurants, bars and hotels with filters. You can select opening hours, rating, price and more to find what you’re after.

Perhaps most excitingly is the new integration with the popular taxi app Uber.

This has shot to prominence with many now using the instant payment app to book taxis.

In the Maps app, users can now compare the taxi ride you’re going with other modes of transportation like walking or public transport.

If a person sticks with the taxi, selecting the Uber option will take you into the Uber app.

The new app also features integration with popular taxi app Uber, letting you compare your taxi route with other modes of transport. You can also launch the Uber app directly from Maps

Tapping the train icon at the top of the screen will now allow you to search for departure times on a specific time and day when planning a journey

Google has also now integrated more train information into the app, so people can select a departure time to find out which train to catch.

The final two features revolve around visiting attractions.

Users can now star locations to take a look at later from within the app or from another device.

It is also possible to instantly dive into Street View at the touch of a button to get a better look around.

‘So, next time you’re caught up in a whirlwind of activity, make navigating your world a little easier,’ Google says in their release statement.

‘Take a moment to grab your phone, open up the Google Maps app, and find all you need to search, navigate and explore the world around you.’

Starring a location will save it for later so you can view it from other devices. This is found by tapping on the place card of a location and hitting the star icon

Tapping on the place card will also let you easily dive into Street View mode, enabling you to explore a destination in first-person within the newly updated Google Maps app
