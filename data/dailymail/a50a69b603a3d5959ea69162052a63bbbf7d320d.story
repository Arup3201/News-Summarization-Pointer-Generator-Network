Grinning smugly for the camera beside a Thai beach, Nathan McIntosh looks pretty pleased with himself.

As well he might.

Although he faced a curfew following his conviction for violent crime, his punishment was postponed – so he could go on this exotic holiday.

The father sent an unrepentant taunt with a sunshine snap from the Thailand resort

The 23-year-old tattooed thug, who 
carried out a ‘sustained attack’ in which he punched and kicked two men 
and a woman, sparked outrage when he was given permission to go on the 
already-booked four-week trip.

Now in a gloating and foul-mouthed 
message to his critics back home in Cornwall, the repeat offender has 
posted holiday snaps of himself online, and described opponents of the 
court’s decision as ‘w******’.

His taunt was directed at his local 
newspaper, the West Briton, after it reported on the backlash which 
followed the decision to allow him the sunshine break.

High life: Nathanial McIntosh was seen riding an elephant during his holiday

Relaxing: In January he was given a 12-week suspended prison sentence and an eight-week curfew, but it looked far from his mind

He posted pictures of himself lying 
beside a tiger, and of bikini-clad dancing girls on stage with the 
caption ‘1st night in Bangkok!’

And addressing the publication with a
photo of himself in beachwear, he wrote: ‘Put this on the front of the 
West Briton....W******!!’

The newspaper did exactly that in yesterday’s edition, beneath the heading: ‘Unrepentant: Thug’s Thailand taunt.’ 

McIntosh in turn responded on Twitter
by calling the newspaper staff ‘c****’ and mocking them for taking the 
‘bait like a fish to a hook’, adding: ‘I am in tears over here [...] 
haha.’

By yesterday afternoon, however, he had restricted his Tweets from public view.

Enjoying his freedom: McIntosh, who has previous convictions for violence following an assault in 2010, posted pictures of himself at pole dancing shows and boxing matches while on holiday

The roofer and amateur footballer 
from Falmouth had admitted using threatening, abusive or insulting words
or behaviour with intent in an incident in Newquay last August.

In January he was given a 12-week suspended prison sentence and an eight-week curfew.

But a magistrate later agreed to lift the curfew so McIntosh could go on the extended break to the Phi Phi Islands.

While enjoying his holiday, McIntosh,
who is banned from the road for driving while three times the legal 
limit, and whose previous offences include a conviction for assault in 
2010, also boasted about watching Thai boxing fights and eating 
McDonald’s.

He will be subjected to the 7pm to 6am daily curfew when he returns next week.

McIntosh, who had a previous conviction for assault in 2010, asked magistrates for an amendment as he had already paid for the holiday to Thailand - and they agreed

McIntosh was also given a 12 week suspended jail term for the incident in Newquay against three people, suspended for a year

The convicted thug had his curfew altered so he could go on holiday to Thailand

West Briton reader Adam Petrauske, 
who spotted McIntosh’s picture on the Instagram website, said: ‘I find 
it absolutely disgusting how he has been able to get away with this.’

Peter Chapman, chairman of the 
Magistrates’ Association’s  sentencing committee, said: ‘If the curfew 
clashes with work, a  pre-booked holiday, a relative’s wedding, or a job
interview, magistrates can adjust the curfew as they see fit.

‘The punishment imposed by a curfew 
consists of the number of days and hours on which the offender’s liberty
is restricted by having to be at home.’

He added: ‘If the magistrates wish the offender to suffer a financial loss, they will order a fine to be paid.

‘They will not add to the punishment by forcing the offender to suffer additional financial losses.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said:
‘Only courts can vary the requirements imposed under suspended sentence
– this is solely a matter for them.’

David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth, 
said: ‘It is absolutely horrifying that an offender such as this who has
harmed others can be allowed to go on holiday instead of carrying out 
his punishment.

‘But sadly this is an all too common story of an offender not having their sentence properly enforced.’
