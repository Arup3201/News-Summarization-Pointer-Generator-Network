A high-altitude research facility that became the coldest of Cold War relics has opened to curious tourists after decades of secrecy.

The massive Stratosphere Chamber was designed under the direction of bouncing bomb inventor Sir Barnes Wallis in 1946.

Researchers used the unique laboratory to test aircraft in frigid conditions experienced at 70,000ft – the target altitude for a new supersonic plane designed by Sir Wallis.

The 50ft long research facility was large enough to hold the fuselage and cockpit of a large plane or a helicopter while replicating temperatures as low as -60C and an air density one-twentieth of that at ground level.

It was even used to find out how cold weather affects naval guns and tanks.

In the 1960s researchers performed extreme weather testing on pressure cabins for the Viscount, Vanguard and VC10 passenger airliners before they came into service.

The 25ft wide chamber was also used for testing North Sea fishing trawlers while reproducing some of the coldest temperatures on Earth

And the test subjects went beyond aircraft. At one point the 25ft wide chamber was used for testing North Sea fishing trawlers while reproducing some of the coldest temperatures on Earth.

Researchers recreated blizzards to help find out why so many of the vessels sunk in Arctic conditions.

According to the museum, a large refrigeration plant supplied extremely cold methane liquid to ‘coolers’ at the four corners of each of the air circulation ducts.

The 340-ton secretive structure was in operation until 1980 and then mothballed at the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge, Surrey

Thanks to a £120,000 grant bosses at the museum have overhauled the chamber and opened it up to the public for the first time

The 340-ton secretive structure was in operation until 1980 and then mothballed at the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge, Surrey, where Sir Wallis oversaw the Vickers-Armstrongs Research and Development Department.

But thanks to a £120,000 grant from the Association of Independent Museum’s Biffa Award Scheme, bosses at the museum have overhauled the chamber and opened it up to the public for the first time.

Visitors can also get a look inside the extraordinary facility’s elevated control room and refrigeration/vacuum plant.

Allan Winn, director of the museum, said: ‘Until now the museum has not had the resources to restore and properly interpret this unique research facility.

‘This restoration and the finished exhibition is wonderful tribute not only to our staff and volunteers but also to Barnes Wallis and his team who created and utilised this extraordinary chamber.’
