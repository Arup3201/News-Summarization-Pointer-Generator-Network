The discovery of shoes deliberately hidden in an ancient Egyptian temple has left archaeologists baffled, not least because they include design features thought to have been invented in Medieval Europe.

Two pairs of tiny children's shoes were among the seven found concealed in a jar placed into a cavity between two mudbrick walls in a temple in Luxor, site of the ancient city of Thebes.

Oddly, they were tied together using palm fibre string and placed within a single adult shoe. A third pair that had been worn by an adult was found alongside them.

Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt: The discovery of ancient shoes with design features first thought to have been invented in Medieval Europe in one of the city's temples has left archaeologists baffled

But there is no clue as to why the 
shoes, which would have been costly and unusual footwear for the era, 
were never retrieved after they were left in the temple just over 2,000 
years ago when Egypt was ruled by a dynasty of Greek descent.

Research has shown that at least one of them includes structural elements that historians had previously believed were not invented until the Medieval era, which began in Europe some 500 years later.

At the time the shoes were concealed, most Egyptians would normally have worn sandals.

The shoes were discovered by an Italian archaeological team in 2004, but a new study has now offered fresh insights into them.

The modern city of Luxor in southern Egypt is the site of the Ancient Egyptian city of Thebes and is a popular destination for tourists.

With the ruins of the temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor standing within its borders, it has been frequently described as the 'world's greatest open air museum'.

Thebes was the great capital of Egypt during the New Kingdom, and the glorious city of the god Amon-Ra. In the Ancient Egyptian texts the city was regarded as 'Waset', meaning 'city of the sceptre'. and also as 'ta ipet', meaning 'the shrine'.

In a later period, the Greeks called it Thebai and the Romans after them Thebae.

The importance of the city started as early as the 11th Dynasty, when the town grew into a thriving city, renowned for its high social status and luxury, but also as a center for wisdom, art, religious and political supremacy.It grew to world-wide prominence during the time of

the New Kingdom, when the Pharoahs undertook military expeditions to Kush, in today's northern Sudan, and to the lands of Canaan, Phoenicia and Syria, bringing back great wealth to the city.

The main god of the city was Amon, who was worshipped together with his wife, the Goddess Mut, and their son Khonsu, the God of the moon.

With the rise of Thebes as the foremost city of Egypt, the local god Amon rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god Ra, thus creating the new 'king of gods' Amon-Ra.

His great temple, at Karnak just north of Thebes, was the most important temple of Egypt right until the end of antiquity.

Andr√© Veldmeijer, assistant director of the Netherlands-Flemish Institute in Cairo and an expert in ancient Egyptian footwear, says it is likely the shoes were foreign made and 'relatively expensive'.

'The find is extraordinary as the shoes were in pristine condition and still supple upon discovery,' wrote Dr Veldmeijer in the most recent issue of the Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt.

Unfortunately, he added, after they were unearthed the shoes became brittle and 'extremely fragile'.

Since sandals were by far the most common footwear of the era in Egypt, the style and quality of the discovered shoes was such that 'everybody would look at you', Dr Veldmeijer told LiveScience.

After being shown photographs of the seven shoes, Dr Veldmeijer made a number of discoveries about their design.

Most surprising was that the single shoe discovered with the child's pairs inside was made with a feature that shoemakers know as a 'rand' - a structural device that was thought to have been first used in Medieval Europe.

Folded leather strips that go between the soles and the upper parts of shoes, rands reinforce the stitching as 'the upper is very prone to tear apart at the stitch holes', Dr Veldmeijer told LiveScience.

They would be useful in muddy conditions where shoes are under pressure, so to find the device in the dry climate of Egypt is surprising and indicates that the shoes were made somewhere abroad.

Dr Veldmeijer also found that the shoes' owners would have tied them using what researchers call 'tailed toggles', which are leather strips that pass through at the top of the shoes.

After they were knotted into place a long strip of leather would have hung down decoratively on either side.

Dr Veldmaijer's analysis of the shoes also revealed insights into the health of their owners.

He found a semi-circular protruding area in one that could have been caused by a bunion, while of the pair of adult shoes the left had more patches and evidence of repair than the right.

'The shoe was exposed to unequal pressure,' he told LiveScience, which showed that person who wore it 'walked with a limp, otherwise the wear would have been far more equal'.

The wear and tear and subsequent repair showed that the people who wore them valued the shoes as 'highly prized commodities', Dr Veldmeijer said, deepening the mystery of why they were left in the temple.

'There's no reason to store them without having the intention of getting them back at some point,' he told LiveScience.

He speculated that there could have been some kind of unrest that spurred the owners to leave their fancy shoes behind and flee hastily.
