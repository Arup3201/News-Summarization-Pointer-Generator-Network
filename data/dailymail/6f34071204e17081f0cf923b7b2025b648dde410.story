A woman who walked in the background of a live post-game broadcast after the LA Kings' Stanley Cup win on Friday became famous when she fell hard on the ice.

The woman was seen walking around on the rink at the Staples Center in Los Angeles as NBCLosAngeles reporter Mario Solis spoke on-air.

Baby steps! Hunsinger is seen walking on the ice

Yikes! Hunsinger slams to the floor behind the live broadcast

Facedown: Hunsinger fells just as reporter Mario Solis said 'Never a dull moment with these Kings'

Wearing a pair of black high heels, she slammed down on the ice just as Solis said 'Never a dull moment with these Kings.' A man was seen during the broadcast helping her get back on her feet.

The woman, who was identified by the station as Hannah Hunsinger, spoke with Solis after the fall.

'Yes I am okay,' she told the reporter. 'You'd think that after skating on the ice, I'd be okay with walking on it but that wasn't the case.'

I'm okay! Hunsinger spoke on-air with Solis after the fall

Hunsinger's fall was quickly spread by both NBCLos Angeles and Deadspin.

Hunsinger, whose Twitter says she is part of the LA Kings' ice crew, tweeted at both media organizations on Saturday and shared a photo of herself standing and smiling on the rink.

'Thank you @Deadspin and @NBCLA for capturing such a fantastic fall. At least I got a good ending pic out of it! #fail,' she wrote.Â
