The King of Spain told courtiers he decided to abdicate because he did not want his son to ‘wither’ and ‘grow old waiting for the throne like Prince Charles’, it was claimed yesterday.

King Juan Carlos last week announced that he would hand over to his 46-year-old heir, Crown Prince Felipe.

In a televised address, the 76-year-old, who has ruled since 1975,  said he wanted to herald in a ‘new era of hope’ and ensure a ‘younger generation… with new energies’ could take over the helm.

And yesterday, according to reports 
in the Spanish press, the king told aides he felt the time was right to 
pass the throne on while Prince Felipe was still a young man.

‘I do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles,’ he reportedly told Rafael Spottorno, chief of the royal household.

The
 private secretary said the king – whose popularity has slumped in 
recent years following a series of scandals – had been considering 
abdicating since his 75th birthday in January last year. 

‘He
 saw, above all, that his son was in his prime and didn’t want to see 
him like Prince Charles who will be 66 years old in November,’ Mr 
Spottorno told Spanish daily newspaper El Mundo.

However, last week, a source at the royal palace in Madrid claimed King Juan Carlos was abdicating for  political reasons. 

The
 monarch’s popularity has nosedived amid accusations of being out of 
touch as his country struggles with its worst economic crisis in memory.

In
 2012, he was widely criticised for going on a secret hunting trip to 
Botswana to shoot elephants. The lavish holiday contrasted with the news
 at home that one in four Spanish workers was jobless.

Prince
 Charles has been waiting for 62 years and four months – longer  than 
any other heir apparent in British history – to take the throne. He 
became heir apparent at the age of three when his mother, then Princess 
Elizabeth, who is now 88, acceded  in 1952.

Spain's King Juan Carlos said on June 2 he would abdicate in favour of his son Prince Felipe, aiming to revive the scandal-hit monarchy at a time of economic hardship and growing discontent with the wider political elite

He broke the previous record for an heir in waiting, set by his great-great-grandfather, Edward VII, in 2011.

King
 Juan Carlos was held in high esteem during most of his reign for his 
role in helping steer Spain from military dictatorship to democracy. 

Yesterday he presided over his last military parade before his son becomes King Felipe VI on June 19.

The majority of Spaniards want a  referendum on the future of the monarchy, according to a poll published today, less than a week after King Juan Carlos abdicated in favour of his son

 Felipe accompanied his father at the annual Armed Forces day ceremony 
in Madrid honouring those who have died in service. 

Since
 the abdication was announced there has been a wave of public 
demonstrations in Spain calling for a referendum over the future of the 
monarchy. 

A poll in the left-leaning El Pais newspaper found 62 per cent of Spaniards believe a vote should be held on the issue.
