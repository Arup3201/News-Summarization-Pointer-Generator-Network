A friend of Texas Ebola patient, Thomas Duncan, who saw the sick man the day he was taken into hospital apparently 'vomiting wildly' has described his family's ordeal in isolation.

And, shockingly, three days after CDC officials visited him in the family's apartment, 43-year-old Aaron Yah revealed he had not received an order to remain indoors or any advice on how to cope.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Mr Yah said: 'The CDC came on Tuesday, the day it was confirmed Thomas had Ebola. They told me that the children should not go to school until 17 October.

Sick with worry: Aaron Yah and his family are being monitored by the CDC after visiting Ebola victim Thomas Dunn on Sunday - the day he was taken to hospital and put in isolation

Fears: Mr Yah said: 'I am concerned. I am worried. All we can do is pray. I can say it is not fair. But what is not fair happens'

'But it was not really confirmed to me that I should stay indoors. I don't know. Can you tell me?'

While Mr Yah said he does not know - and has not been told what to do - it was revealed on Thursday that Thomas Duncan's family have been ordered to stay indoors after violating officials request to do so.

Mr Yah, originally from Liberia, has lived in America for many years, he said. He lives with fiancée Youngor, 35, and their four children three boys ages 2, 4 and 11 and a six-year-old daughter.

He has been visited by CDC officials daily since confirmation of Mr Duncan's infection.

He said: 'They take our temperature and blood pressure but I don’t know what is going on. They do not tell us what to do for food. Maybe someone will bring us food. Or can I use my card to get some if I sanitize it. I know Ebola is in the blood and body fluids.'

As well as being confused and frightened for his family, Mr Yah said he did not know what was being done for Mr Duncan.

He said: 'They say the ZMapp is finished. So what will happen? Will he remain in hospital without medication for the rest of his life?'

Mr Yah only actually met Mr Duncan for the first time when the Ebola victim arrived in America last month. He appeared fit and healthy, he recalled.

The men came to know each other through Youngor's family – Mr Duncan stayed with Youngor's mother in Liberia and Mr Duncan's grandmother has provided care for their three youngest children at the now quarantined Ivy Apartments.

Isolated: Mr Yah said that while his children have been told not to go to school under October 17, he has not been told by the CDC to stay indoors and was critical of the confusing advice they have given him and his family

Horror: Mr Yah last saw Thomas Duncan, above, on Sunday. He was lying in bed having been up all night with diarrhea. Mr Yah asked him how he was and Duncan replied: 'I'm not okay'

The entire family has been exposed.

Mr Duncan revealed: 'The last time I saw Thomas was Sunday, the day he went to hospital. I had seen him after he went to hospital the first time and he was looking fine, he had been just fine.

'But that day I passed by on Sunday he was lying down on the bed in the room and I asked him how he was. He said, "I'm not okay."

'He said he had been having diarrhea all night. Later they came and took him to the hospital.'

Reuters reported that he was seen vomiting wildly as he was strapped to a gurney and taken away. 

Ebola is only contagious when someone is showing symptoms which can be vague initially – fever, flu-like aches and abdominal pain progressing to vomiting and diarrhea.

It spreads through close contact with a patient’s body fluids such as blood, sweat, feces, urine, saliva or semen. These fluids must make contact with a cut or scrape, or someone touching their nose, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands or beng splashed providing an entry point for the Ebola.

Mr Yah revealed that he learned of Mr Duncan's diagnosis the very day he was supposed to go back to work at the Meadows Nursing home where he works as a nursing assistant.

'As a matter of fact I was on the phone to them talking about my shift when CDC called,' he said. 

Since that visit life has stalled for the family who are left in isolation and uncertainty.

Antibacterial hand wash and wipes sit by the front door of the family's apartment. Mr Yah and Youngor repeatedly reapply both to their children's hands and toys.

He said: 'It is hard. The children are very bored being indoors and all that we watch on TV is the news.'

In the startling absence of any concrete information the family are left to watch rolling news for updates and to pray.

Orders: While the family of Duncan (seen here picking up a food package) have been told to stay indoors specifically by a judge - Mr Yah's family have not and are left wondering what they should do

They have connected with a pastor in Liberia who learned of their plight through family members.

Mr Yah said: 'We pray every day, every day.'

Guided through psalms and prayers by Pastor Samuel who preached via speakerphone Mr Yah read aloud to his fiancée and children.

The passages were filled with images of death, perseverance and suffering.

'By the sweat of your blood you will eat bread or food until you return to the ground since form it you were taken... from dust you come and to dust you will return.'

And 'Dogs have surrounded me: a band of evil men has encircled me. They have pierced my hands and my feet.'

And 'Yay though I walk through the Valley of death I will fear no evil…'

Between each passage Pastor Samuel sought to comfort the family in these images of ancient suffering.

Later the family prayed aloud, Youngor crying out with her hands raised: 'We present our family oh Father. Ebola does not belong here. Ebola does now belong in this home.

'We ask that you destroy Ebola. We ask for our children Oh God. We ask for America.'

A tear streaked down her face as she said: 'Father there is nowhere for us to go. Take Ebola, we send it back to you oh God. Destroy it in the name of Lord Jesus.'

But as well as their pleas to God, Mr Yah had demands of the CDC and FDA.

Grim: A burial team loads the corpse of an Ebola victim in Monrovia, Liberia - where Duncan travelled from

Precautions: Authorities have stressed that Ebola is not infectious until a person shows symptoms. But that's not stopped concern over the freedom of movement of those who have come in contact with Duncan

He said: 'What is the CDC and the FDA really doing? What are they trying to do? What is the effort – not just here in America, this is not just here. It's worldwide. What are they doing?'

As for his own family he admitted: 'I am concerned. I am worried. All we can do is pray. I can say it is not fair. But what is not fair happens.

'I know that some people can contact it and not get it. We just pray that everybody will be on that safe side.'
