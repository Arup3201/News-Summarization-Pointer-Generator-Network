Hero Murray dedicates history win to coach Ivan Lendl

'Well done, Andy': Stars' Twitter tributes

PICTURE SPECIAL: Relive Murray's glorious Wimbledon campaign

Banish the references to Fred Perry. Throw out the record books. Andy Murray has made the history Britain was hoping for by claiming the Wimbledon men's singles title.

Not since 1936 has the All England Club witnessed a home winner but the 26-year-old Scot fulfilled a lifetime ambition, and those of generations of tennis fans, by defeating Novak Djokovic in the men’s singles final 6-4, 7-5, 6-4.

The Centre Court crowd erupted with a roar never before heard as the Serbian plunged a groundstroke into the net to give Murray the victory.

But he had thoroughly earned it. He 
threw off his hat, screamed in joy, and pumped his fists in the 
direction of his team up in the stands and he scaled the steps to hug 
each of them in turn. There were tears from him and his mother Judy.

It may have been straight sets but 
there was drama at the finale. Of course there was.

Will Andy Murray win Sports Personality of the Year?

Murray needed four 
Championship points to get the job done but that will not matter a jot.

Serving for the match, he raced a 
40-0 lead and stood on the precipice of history ground-breaking enough 
to shake Centre Court to its core.

But Djokovic, never one to give up 
easily, ensured the wait would go on a little longer, saving all three 
Championship points, then doing the unthinkable and holding three break 
points.

But Murray only increased his athleticism, his determination, his guts, to turn it around and show he was the better player.

It was excruciating. But what are a few extra minutes when you’ve been waiting 77 years?

The opening told how the match would take shape with plenty of break points and long rallies from the outset. There was ebb and flow too. Murray won the first three points only for Djokovic to take the next five.

At 1-1, the third game provided a vignette of the quality, excitement, and gripping tension that would follow. It took beyond 10 minutes and had epic rallies lasting 24 and 25 shots. At the end of it Murray was celebrating, finally breaking his advisory for the first time at the seventh time of asking.

Splitting it up: Serbian world No 1 Djokovic takes a slide on the Centre Court grass

Djokovic broke straight back in the 
next game, but, at 3-3 on the Serb’s serve Murray’s defensive qualities 
shone through. He took it, then secured a vital, tense service game to 
lead 5-3. Minutes later he had the all-important first set.

The second saw more gruelling groundstroke duels before Djokovic, as expected, upped his game to break in the fourth game.

But with Murray at the peak of his 
abilities – full of running and incredible reaches – it never felt like 
that would prove definitive and indeed it proved as he broke back in the
seventh. Djokovic showed an unusual lack of composure in handing the 
game to Murray with a double fault.

Errant challenges were also becoming a
feature, and at 5-5 on his serve, Djokovic would come to rue the 
incorrect calls to Hawk-Eye.

At 15-15 he felt a ball from Murray fell 
long but he had lost the ability to challenge. After losing the point he
was evidently upset, asking umpire Mohamed Lahyani: ‘You can’t see 
this?’

On target: Murray was in sensational form as he claimed the Wimbledon title against the world No 1 Djokovic

It turned out he was wrong anyway and
the ball clipped the line but Djokovic was rattled. The score 
progressed to 30-40 and a shot into the net gave Murray an important 
break.

He served it out, laying down an ace 
to take the second set and a 2-0 lead. It was so important. Not since 
Henri Cochet in 1927 had a player come back from two sets down to win a 
men’s final. That bit of history was too much to change.

Murray was on a roll, breaking 
Djokovic in the first game of the third set and then taking another to 
make it five games in a row.

But, once more, Djokovic surged, breaking Murray twice to claim four in a row in response.

Yet again the momentum swung, however, and this time decisively in Murray’s favour.

With lung-busting sprint after 
lung-busting sprint, he first got level to 4-4, then took the score in 
the penultimate game to 40-15 in his favour with a trademark forehand 
down the line on the run.

The game was sealed and the rest is (new) history.
