Some of the families who were driven out of their houses in last winter's floods are finally home - just in time for Christmas.

Hundreds of home owners were forced to abandon their houses on the Somerset Levels after record rainfall saw rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging.

More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated with quickly rising waters and entire villages were cut off after roads became unusable.

Now, several families have managed to make it home for the first time since they were evacuated.

Among them are Gavin and Bryony Sadler, and their children, Toby and Elsa, who returned to the Old Vicarage in Moorland, Somerset, exactly nine months and two days after the devastating floods. 

Mrs Sadler, a leading member of the Flooding On the Levels Action Group, said: 'We've got young kids and it's been my paramount wish that we would get them back in time.

'Christmas is Christmas and you can see from the smiles on their faces that they are back home - we didn't need any more presents than that.'

The Sadlers' home was flooded by two and a half feet of water after the River Parrett burst its banks.

'We'll be replacing things for months to come, but the main thing is that we are back,' Mrs Sadler said. 'The children are much happier now they are home. 

'Toby's school, Stoke St Gregory primary and the preschool that Elsa attends, the Willows Set, have been massively supportive.

'It has been so important for them to feel secure through all that has happened.'

Following the devastation, which took place between December 2013 and March this year, 8,000 metres of river was dredged at a cost of £6 million.

However, despite many making it home just in time for Christmas, dozens of families left homeless by the floods are still facing the festive period in temporary accommodation.

They include Sally Vize, who is currently living in a mobile home at Church Farm, Moorland, while her house is being repaired.

She was born in the farmhouse and this Christmas will be the first she has not spent in her home - but she remains stoical.

'I think everyone is in a better place now,' she said. 'They have started work on the house and we can see that things are moving on.'

'We have a shower here in the mobile home, but I do miss a bath, and I do wish I could dry the washing. 

'But you just have to carry on.'

Steve Parsons and his partner Alison are still camping out in a caravan beside their home at Fordgate.

The house they bought as a family home is still drying out.

Mr Parsons said: 'It was built in 1783 and it's got clay walls. It has been restored with lime plaster, but it just takes time to dry.

'Life in a caravan is a bit cold and damp but it was our choice, we wanted to be on site.

'I just felt with the problems some people have had that I wanted to be close to what was happening.'

But there will be no Christmas lights in the caravan this year.

'The electricity doesn't really run to that, and we can only run a certain amount of heaters,' Mr Parsons said.

The partnership of authorities including district and county councils and the Environment Agency say they continue to make progress in delivering the 20 Year Somerset Levels and Moors Flood Action Plan.

The plan includes improving infrastructure so that roads are more resilient as well as homes, to help protect businesses and residents.

The Somerset Flood Relief Fund, launched by Somerset Community Foundation saw a national outpouring of goodwill which raised around £1.35 million.

Justin Sargent, SCF chief executive, said last night that more than £1.1 million has been distributed, mainly to households and individuals, but also to provide other essential aid.

He said: 'The main flood relief fund has still got funds remaining reserved for people still on their journey to get their home back up and running in a reasonable condition and to rebuild their lives.

'We are also working very closely with the Freemasons who have a separate fund with us which we invest in the community and projects which will help those affected such as village halls.'

The restored village hall at Moorland, which received help from the masons' fund, is now a much-improved hub and is hosting church services while work continues on the church.

Parishioners will celebrate Christmas there.
