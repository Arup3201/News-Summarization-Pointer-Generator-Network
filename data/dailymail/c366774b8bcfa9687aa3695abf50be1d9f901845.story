A man who tried to board a plane at Los Angeles International Airport with a smoke grenade, a gas mask, and a host of weapons gave authorities a perplexing explanation when asked why he did it.

He said: 'This is a game.'

Boston-bound Yongda Huang Harris, 28, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of transporting hazardous materials on a flight from Japan, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said.

Harris is a U.S. citizen from Boston and had recently started living and working in Japan, officials said.

ABC News reported that Harris appeared confused about why he was being stopped by authorities.

His response has baffled federal investigators, who are currently trying to figure out his motive, especially since Harris has now stopped cooperating with the investigation.

ABC reported that Harris was also carrying a laptop, which was found to contain Japanese fantasy rape writings, pornography and a copy of The Poor Man's James Bond, a text that instructs readers how to build bombs and improvised weaponry.

Harris made an initial appearance in federal court on Tuesday after being charged with one count of transporting hazardous materials.

If found guilty, he could spend up to five years in prison.

Harris drew suspicion when U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the airport said they noticed he was wearing a bulletproof vest and flame retardant pants under his trench coat.

The observation triggered a formal investigation by Homeland Security special agents.

In
a search of checked luggage, numerous suspicious items were uncovered, 
including knives, body bags, a hatchet, collapsible baton, biohazard 
suit, full-face respirator and billy clubs, authorities said.

The smoke grenade was subsequently X-rayed by the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad.

Officers said the device fell into a category that is prohibited on board passenger aircraft by the United Nations.

'Depending on the conditions when it is ignited, the smoke grenade, made by Commando Manufacturers, could potentially fill the cabin of a commercial airplane with smoke or cause a fire,' federal officials said in a release.

Attempts to reach Harris' family in Boston and his associates were unsuccessful.
