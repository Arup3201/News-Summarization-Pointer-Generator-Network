Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale scored five goals between them as Real Madrid romped to an 8-2 win over Deportivo at Riazor with Javier Hernandez also scoring twice – his first goals since his move from Manchester United.

With two defeats in their opening three games Madrid had come into the game languishing in mid-table but Ronaldo rose to the occasion with a towering header for the first goal. He also scored the third giving Madrid a 3-1 lead at half time and when the home side dared to edge back into the game at the start of the second half Gareth Bale finished them off with a quick double.

He now has four goals this season and Ronaldo, who scored a hat-trick continues his incredible goal a game record. It was ruthless from Bale and Ronaldo who reminded everyone why he went from being a wiry winger to a brutally effective centre-forward in his last season at Manchester United.

Great headers of the ball score from bad crosses and Alvaro Arbeloa’s centre had no pace on it and was slightly behind Ronaldo. But still he climbed above the Deportivo defence and looped a header past keeper German Lux to score his first goal on this ground in his fourth visit, on the half hour.

He celebrated – from a seated position inside the penalty area – with his now trademark hands out palms-down calm down gesture: do not fear, Ronaldo is here. 

Six minutes later Real had doubled their lead and James Rodriguez had his first league goal for the club. He broke his duck in midweek in the Champions League with a tap-in from a rebound, this was a little bit more like that World Cup wonder-goal volley against Uruguay.

On the left-hand side of the penalty area he received the ball from Karim Benzema and curled a shot into Lux’ top corner with the Argentine keeper helplessly flapping as it sailed past him. The Deportivo keeper’s afternoon was about to get much worse.

Marcelo played the ball forward to Benzema and he was scythed down by Lux rushing out from his goal. The loose ball ran to Ronaldo and he put it into the empty net with the keeper saved from a red card but Deportivo having to restart the game for the third time in the first 45 minutes.

Madrid had made hard work of breaking Deportivo down. Bale had seen plenty of the ball but when he dropped one perfect right footed cross on Ronaldo's head the Portuguese headed straight at the keeper.

Bale should have put Real Madrid ahead but shot straight at the keeper from close range after Benzema’s shot was parried by Lux and he then should have been played in by Ronaldo but the former Manchester United man snatched at a shot instead of playing the pass.

But, once Ronaldo had found his range, Carlo Ancelotti’s side just moved up through the gears and looked far superior to their opponents. Deportivo have been reading too many 'Madrid in crisis' stories - throwing men forward at will and leaving huge space in behind. They made two changes at half time with Helder Postiga and former Real Madrid-B midfielder Juanfran hooked and soon they had narrowed the margin.

Ramos was adjudged to have handled in the area and Haris Medunjanin sent Casillas the wrong way from the penalty spot. It was harsh on Ramos who claimed the ball hit his side but the finish had been emphatic. Deportivo’s tails were up and Casillas had to save from Luis Fariña. Defensive midfielder Asier Illaramendi replaced forward Benzema as Ancelotti tried to close the game down.

A fourth goal was always going to have the same effect and Bale delivered it wrapping his foot around a Marcelo pass to send it first time past the luckless Lux.

With Benzema off, Bale and Ronaldo were now up-front in a 4-4-2 with Ancelotti showing no signs of moving Bale further from goal as has been suggested to him. Bale had responded with Real's fourth goal and his third of the season and soon he scored the fifth and his second of the afternoon from an Isco pass.

Ronaldo completed his hat-trick from another Isco pass and there was still time for Hernandez to get in on the act. ‘Chicharito’ had replaced Bale and he hammered home from the edge of the area to score his first and repeated the trick in injury time to make it 8-2.

After the game Sergio Ramos was asked if 12 goals in two games put paid to Real’s crisis. He said: ‘This can be a difficult place to come but we won the ball back well and kept the intensity up throughout. We had not made the best of starts to the season but we showed what we can do in midweek against Basle and we repeated it here.’
