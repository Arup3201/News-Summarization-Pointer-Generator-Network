As showboating goes, this is about as dangerous as it gets.

The foolish fly-bys are being performed by an Argentine pilot at one of the South American nation's air bases in Antarctica.

In a series of show-off swoops, the reckless pilot almost knocks bystanders off their feet with his down force as he pulls out of nose dives with just metres to go.

Narrow miss: The gathered photographers breathe a sigh of relief as the plane passes by safely.

Recipe for disaster: The aircraft is barely metres above runway while travelling at high speed

With an overconfident pilot in 
control and an audience to impress, the series of events, which was 
captured on film, has all the hallmarks of a Costa Concordia type 
disaster.

Luckily for the photographers gathered, the C-130 Hercules remains airborne just about.

The Argentine Hercules were used to attack British vessels during the Falkands conflict.Â

It is this type of low flying ability which shows why they were so effective in engaging floating targets.

But in peacetime, they are used by pilots to perform these dangerous and improvised air shows.

Aviation experts have long criticised fly-bys, which serve no purpose other than entertaining crowds.

Clips of this stunt, which was posted on fan forum 'The Aviationist', was slammed by qualified pilots.

One said: 'That was done, quite recklessly I might add, in order to 'woo' and 'aww' the crowd on the ground.

Flat hatting: The practice is frowned upon by the aviation community

'It's called "flat-hatting", and there are plenty of dead airmen to show why it is a foolish thing to do, something you are told you will not do from day one of flight school.

Such stunts in these conditions can be especially dangerous. The Marambio base, is one of the few airstrips able to function in Antarctica.

In the summer temperatures average around -1.5 degrees, while in the winter they plummet to a petrifying -15 degrees.

Argentina retains the base for pilot training, with the base positioned close to the southern coats of the country.
