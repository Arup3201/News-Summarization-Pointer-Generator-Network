Jailed: Daniel Olley left his victims - some of them mothers - feeling 'foolish, shattered and betrayed'

A conman who plundered cars and money from vulnerable women he met on dating websites was yesterday jailed for almost four years.

Daniel Olley, 45, of Ipswich, Suffolk, left his four victims - some of them mothers - feeling ‘foolish, shattered and betrayed’ for allowing themselves to be fooled by his lies, a court was told.

One of the women was left so penniless that she could not afford to buy new winter clothes for her children after former mechanic Olley - who has previously been sentenced for similar offences - stole hundreds of pounds from her.

And another mother had to get a taxi to visit her son in hospital after Olley stole her car.

Olley, who was living at a Kingsley Guest House in Ipswich, admitted offences of theft from four women and fraud relating to selling their cars.

He carried out the crimes between October and December last year, Ipswich Crown Court heard.

Jailing him for 46 months, Judge David Goodin said there was a ‘cynical cruelty’ to his offending and told him: ‘You are in effect a cautionary tale for vulnerable women’.

The judge said what Olley had done to the four women, three of whom he met on dating websites, was ‘horrid in the extreme’.

Charlotte Davison, prosecuting, said one of the women who met him online was told by him he was a car trader. He offered to sell her vehicle after she told him she had a £1,100 debt that had to be paid.

He took her vehicle and after days of making excuses to her she did not see him or her car again. The woman told police she had lost confidence and weight as a result of the way Olley treated her.

Another woman who had met him through a dating website was told by Olley he had a garage in Bury St Edmunds, had recently sold his home for £200,000 and was looking for somewhere to live.

Olley told her that her car needed work doing to it and was not safe to drive. He sold the car and the woman later found a folder containing its documents was missing from her home.

The woman told police she was depressed, embarrassed and angry after being tricked.

A third woman who also met Olley on a dating website agreed to lend him £250. But after giving him her bank card and PIN she discovered he had withdrawn £300 - and he later took out another £250.

Catherine Bradshaw, defending, said Olley accepted the offences were confidence tricks. She said he also accepted that his victims were women looking for relationships and he had exploited them.

It was not clear on which dating website Olley met the women, although in a previous case last year in Chelmsford, Essex, involving similar offences, he was revealed to have used Plenty Of Fish.

In that case in May 2012, he pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud and was sentenced to 18 months in prison - only months after being released from jail for further similar offences.
