Guilty: Donald Fortin was convicted of engaging Zumba prostitute Alexis Wright in Kennebunk, Maine

Of the 68 men charged with having sex with a Maine Zumba instructor-turned-prostitute, the first john was found guilty on Thursday.

Donald Fortin, 59, of Turner, was convicted of engaging prostitute Alexis Wright, 30, after a two-day trial.

The married man was fined $610, less than the maximum $1,000. Fortin will not face jail.

He claimed that he paid Wright for a massage and nothing else but the jury in York County Superior Court found him guilty after an hour of deliberation.

Wright is currently serving a ten-month jail sentence after pleading guilty to 14 prostitution charges and six other misdemeanors in March.

Her scandalous case received international attention after she was charged with running a prostitution business out of a Zumba studio in the sleepy community of Kennebunk, Maine.

Fortin is owner and founder of Fortin Construction Inc, a company that boasts of being 'Number one Maine Home Builder for over 20 years,' and advertises itself online as 'A Christian Family Owned Company.'

As previously reported, Fortin is a staunch advocate of conservative family values.

According to state records, he donated $1,000 to Protect Maine Marriage and organization set up to 'defend' marriage in the state from the perceived onslaught from 'gay rights activists' and 'radical judges' seeking to 'redefine marriage.'

He also made a donation of $350 to Senator Garrett Mason, a conservative opponent of the state's same-sex marriage ballot.

During his trial, prosecutors showed Skype screenshot images from October 24, 2011, of him engaging in sexual contact with Wright.

Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan said Kennebunk Police Officer Audra Presby testified that Fortin called her in October of 2012 asking if he was on Wrightâ€™s client list.

Fortin reportedly told Presby that he had visited Wright and only paid for a massage. He also said that Wright appeared aroused during his visit and came onto him.

Wright didn't testify during Fortin's court appearance.

Fortin is second of Wright's alleged clients to be taken to trial. Former Kennebunk High School hockey coach Don Hill was acquitted due to a lack of evidence.

Justice Roland Cole ended Hill's trial in August after barring prosecutors from entering Wright's business ledger into evidence.

Mr Hill, who has been divorced for years, was one of 68 people charged with paying for sex with Wright. At least 58 have pleaded guilty or no contest.

Wright pleaded guilty, but that didn't stop her from giving her husband an entirely different story.

She told him that she had sex with more than 100 men for money because she believed she was working as an undercover agent for the State of Maine investigating 'sexual deviancy' in the postcard town of Kennebunk.

Wright gave her married name in court 
in August, Alexis Sandra Trowbridge. It appears her husband, Jason 
Trowbridge, believes her story and is taking her back.

Wright now maintains she was a 
pawn all along.

It has emerged that Wright claims that Mark Strong, her 
business partner who was found guilty of promoting prostitution, told 
her that he was on special assignment for the state of Maine and that he
had hired her as his undercover agent.

Different defense: Hill (left) said that he had a relationship with Wright (right) and that he did not pay for sex, though her ledger was not allowed to be submitted as part of the evidence against him

Wright
claimed that Strong, a licensed private investigator, told her that the 
brothel she operated out of her Zumba studio was really an elaborate 
sting operation backed by the state of Maine.

The goal, Wright claims she was told, was to catch sexual deviants in Kennebunk. Strong's attorney said Wright's claims are laughable.

'That this woman, who had allegedly 
taken on 100 or so men to have sex with for money, was investigating for
sexual deviancy, is the pot calling the kettle black,' lawyer Daniel G.
Lilley told MailOnline.

Lilley said it doesn't appear 
prosecutors bought her claim. There was no evidence presented at 
Strong's trial that he had said he was working for the government.

Pleading the Fifth: Alexis Wright, serving 10 months in jail, took the stand in August and refused to testify against Hill

Wright's husband Jason says he believes his wife's story and is standing by her. Prosecutors say she had sex with more than 100 men for money - sometimes five in a day

Wright's
husband Jason Trowbridge, however, does seem to believe her. He stood 
by his wife in an interview with a TLC documentary called 'Sex, Lies and Zumba.'

'It
sounds crazy. It just made more sense that's what was going on,' Mr 
Trowbridge told the documentary. 'Put the pieces together. That fits the
story.

'People think it's a joke and people might always think it's a joke. I'll stand by her story because that's what I saw.'

Wright first made reference to her bizarre claim when she spoke up at her sentencing hearing.

She
claims that the meticulous records she kept and the fact that Strong 
had to be watching via webcam during each of her trysts are proof that 
she thought she was having sex with the men as part of an official 
government investigation.

The attorney for Strong, who was convicted of promoting prostitution and sentenced to 20 days in jail, said Wright's claims are laughable
