The Qatari ruling family is due to make hundreds of millions of pounds from skyscrapers built on Olympic land  bought ‘for a song’ from the Government, it emerged last night.

A Middle-East firm that is  co-owned by the powerful al-Thani royal family paid a knockdown £557million for 1,400 flats in the Athletes Village in 2011.

At the time Britain was still in an  economic crisis and property prices were low.

Good buy: Qatari Diar and Delancey, co-owned by the powerful al-Thani royal family, paid a knockdown £557million for the 1,400 flats, some pictured, in the Athletes Village in 2011

High Value: One of the six plots by the Athletes Village in east London that will be developed. Experts think the company could make a £1billion profit by developing the area

The flats were built to house 23,000 
athletes and officials during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
Games – including Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt and South African runner 
Oscar Pistorius – but were sold to Qatari Diar and Delancey before the 
Games even started. Experts claim that QDD could now net a £1billion 
profit from the purchase as the capital’s property market continues to 
boom.

This is because the 
deal also included six little-publicised plots next to the village, for 
which there is already outline planning permission for 2,000 residential
 flats.

This includes 
permission for a 50-storey block – which would be the tallest building 
on the Olympic Park after the ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture and which 
could prove a goldmine for its overseas buyers.

There is also outline planning permission for two 32-storey blocks, a hotel and a shopping and leisure development.

The
 estimated profits raise questions over whether the public was 
short-changed when the deal – which will be finalised this month – was 
agreed more than two years ago.

The flats, another selection of which are pictured, were built to house 23,000 athletes and officials during the London 2012 Games - and were sold to the company before the Olympics had even started

Last
 night Justin Bowden, of the union GMB, said: ‘The Qataris bought it for
 a knockdown price and now they look set to make a wad of cash.

‘What
 has not been properly analysed yet is whether foreign investors are 
paying proper taxes and if they are here for the long-term or to make a 
quick buck.’

Bert 
Schouwenburg, international officer for the GMB, which has previously 
called the Qatari ruling family ‘secretive, playboy investors’, said: 
‘We got a shocking deal when the Olympic Village was sold.

‘Taxpayers’
 money was used to build it and then it was sold for a song. The 
Government didn’t know what to do with it and they ran out of money to 
keep it.’

He also raised concerns over the ‘diabolical’ treatment of migrant labourers by Qatari-owned building firms overseas.

He
 added: ‘The area around Newham is also among the poorest in London, 
with long waiting lists for council houses, but it seems likely they 
will be sold as luxury flats to speculative overseas investors, many of 
which could then sit empty.’

QDD
 – a joint venture between the oil-rich state’s investment arm and 
British firm Delancey – is one of many businesses owned by the Qataris 
which are snapping up some of Britain’s most prestigious properties.

HarrodsThe
 Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, told the Financial 
Times in 2010: ‘We are investing  everywhere. Even your Harrods, we took
 it.’ They bought it for £1.5billion.

The ShardThe tallest skyscraper in Europe is owned by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).

Sainsbury’sThe royal family of the Gulf kingdom  has a 26 per cent stake.

One Hyde ParkThe
 world’s most expensive apartment block is owned by Project Grande 
(Guernsey), a joint venture between the former Qatari prime minister, 
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, and Christian Candy’s CPC 
Group.

London Stock ExchangeQatar bought a 20 per cent stake of  LSE in 2007, and took a 9.98 per cent stake in Nordic exchange OMX at the same time.

Camden MarketIn
 2008, the QIA became an unlikely major stakeholder in London’s Camden 
Market after buying a 20 per cent stake in property group Chelsfield. 
They claimed that the investment in the alternative market offered a 
good opportunity to buy up further assets.

Royal AscotIn
 January, the Queen gave permission for the ruling al-Thani family of 
Qatar to become her first commercial partner at Royal Ascot through the 
holding company for the Qataris called Qipco. Its name will be allowed 
to appear in places such as the top of stalls and at the back of the 
parade ring.

They are currently said to be involved in a bitter battle to gain ownership of Claridge’s hotel in London.

Experts estimated that a two single-bedroom apartment on the Olympic Village site would sell for £350,000.

Michael
 Sacks of Sequre property investment said the value of the existing 
flats, plus the profit made on new-build apartments would add up to ‘a 
fantastic deal for the buyer’.

He
 added: ‘If they were to stagger the sales over the next five to ten 
years, then you’re easily looking at over the  £1billion mark profit.’

The Olympic Development Authority said the developers would not have to sell or rent the flats as affordable housing.

QDD
 is already making money from the existing flats inside the former 
Athletes’ Village, where tenants pay up to £515-a-week. It has been coy 
over the future of the six development plots.

However, a source told the Mail they already had plans ‘for two skyscrapers within two years’.

So far the Government has lost £500million on the sale of the former Olympic Village, now re-named East Village.

The
 ODA spent £1.3billion building the flats and converting them into 
saleable properties. It was initially supposed to be wholly funded by 
the private sector, but the economic crisis in 2009 made it difficult to
 attract investors.

The same
 year, public-private venture Triathlon Homes bought the leasehold for 
the first 1,379 homes for £268million. QDD snapped up the remaining 
1,439 for  £557million in 2011.

A
 spokesman for the ODA insisted: ‘The ODA firmly believes, as it did in 
2011, that the sale of the former Olympic Village provides a good deal 
for the taxpayer.’

A 
spokesman for QDD said: ‘The plans are at a preliminary stage. However, 
we can confirm that the buildings are likely to be less than the maximum
 of 50 storeys permitted by the outline permission.’
