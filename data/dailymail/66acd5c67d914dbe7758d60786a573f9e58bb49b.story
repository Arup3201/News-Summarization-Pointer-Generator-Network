Model railway enthusiasts have recreated the Great Train Robbery in a small scale depiction of the infamous crime.

Volunteers from Luton Model Railway Club spent over a year carefully building the replica train, robbers and money bags from the heist.

Their diorama shows the night in August 1963 when a gang of robbers stole £2.6million from a mail train in Buckinghamshire.

Detail: The model train fans made the diorama after being inspired by coverage of the robbery;s 50th anniversary

During the incident driver of the train Jack Mills, was hit over the head with an iron bar suffering serious head injuries.

He recovered but still suffered from severe headaches, and although he returned to work, he retired in 1967.

He died in 1970 aged 64 from an illness unrelated to the robbery but his family maintains the trauma 
never left him.

The scale model includes mini bags of cash being unloaded from a carriage and the robbers making off with their haul.

The club said they were inspired by last year’s 50th anniversary of the robbery.

Nigel Adams, 54, project manager at an electronics company, said: 'We do not condone the actions of the event, but it is a fact that the Great Train Robbery has become a part of the national consciousness for many people over a certain age.

'National consciousness': A spokesman for the group said they wanted to mark the event because of its historical importance

Heist: Seven of the robbers, including Ronnie Biggs, were given lengthy jail sentences after they were caught

'We have tried to portray this event 
in a sensitive way, taking due regard for the injuries sustained by the 
locomotive crew on the night.'

The
 diorama is an O gauge 7mm finescale and measures in at three metres 
wide, with light and sound helping to portray what happened that night.

The
 exhibition is currently insured at a value of £8,000 including 
operating stock and requires two people and two cars to transport it to 
exhibitions.

Aftermath: These images show the looted train after the robbery had taken place

Embankment: This is the grassy bank where the robber would have made off with their stolen cash

Victim: Train driver Jack Mills was hit over the head with an iron bar during the Great Train Robbery and suffered severe headaches in the years after before he died in 1970

Mr Adams added: 'There are 15 figures on the display, although we have taken care to present them as just that - figures on a model.

'We do not identify any personalities due to the sensitive nature of the subject.'

The Great Train Robbery saw Ronnie Biggs make off with the stolen money but he escaped from prison and eventually fled to Brazil. He returned to the UK in 2001.

Another seven men involved received huge jail sentences.

The reconstruction, which includes a commentary, will be on display at the National Festival of Railway Modelling in Peterborough in October.
