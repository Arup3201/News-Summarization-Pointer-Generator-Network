The ISIS commander who appeared alongside a child executioner in a chilling video just days ago it believed to have been killed in Syria. 

Abu Sa'ad al-Dāghistāni has died in Kobane, ISIS fighters on Twitter are claiming.

al-Dāghistāni - who is described variously as a fighter and an ISIS intelligence commander - featured in what's believed to be ISIS' last video, which claimed to show a young boy executing two Russian spies in the Islamic State.

Abu Sa'ad al-Dāghistāni was killed days after he appeared in ISIS' latest shocking video

In the video, al-Dāghistāni is shown standing alongside a young boy behind two so-called Russian spies

The footage showed the boy standing next to al-Dāghistāni, behind two kneeling 'spies', after which the boy apparently shoots the grey-clad men in the back of their heads.

However, lack of visible injuries on the men and evidence of blood after the killings suggest the executions may be staged for the cameras. 

The seven-and-a-half minute video starts with interviews with the two men where they admit to spying on ISIS on behalf of Russia.

The men tell an interviewer off-camera their names are Mamayev Jambulat Yesenajovich and Ashimov Sergey Nikolayavich, that they are Kazakh and were recruited by 'Russian Intelligence'.

The 'execution scene' sees al-Dāghistāni dressed in a camouflage uniform, with the young boy standing next to him holding a handgun.

al-Dāghistāni - who is understood to have been killed in Kobane - claims they have confessed to being spies

The young boy is then shown apparently shooting the two men dead - although the footage has not been independently verified

The boy then tells the camera he hopes to be a fighter in the future

al-Dāghistāni speaks during the video, telling the cameraman 'Allah has gifted the Islamic State with these two spies'.

'By Allah's grace, they are now in the custody of the lion cubs of the Khilafah,' he adds.

The boy walks up behind the 'spies' and appears to be shooting them both in the back of the head, before raising the gun and cheering. 

MailOnline has not been able to verify the authenticity of the video, which was uploaded to an anonymous vidme account linked to a Twitter user no longer in use.

News of al-Dāghistāni's death began to circulate on Twitter yesterday but details are unclear.
