Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin has fuelled speculation he's set for a summer move away from the club by admitting a transfer looks likely.

The highly-coveted player has previously been linked to north London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, with the Frenchman handing in a transfer request at the start of the season.

Ronald Koeman is likely to struggle to keep the midfielder at the club - even if the Saints qualify for the Champions League - with his head seemingly turned.

'I have a contract until 2017,' Schneiderlin told Canal+. 'Today, I aspire to play at the highest level. I haven't been in contact with (Arsenal manager Arsene) Wenger.

'There are clubs that are interested, but I haven't agreed to join anyone. I am concentrating on my matches. I know for sure that something is going to happen.'

Despite a rocky start to the season, Schneiderlin has been an ever present in the Southampton side - forming a formidable partnership with Victor Wanyama.
