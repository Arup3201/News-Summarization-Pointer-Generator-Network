An amorous couple have sent a tongue-in-cheek apology note to a Melbourne bar after they enjoyed a steamy tryst in the venue's bathroom.

In February, the couple spent half an hour locked in the toilets of pop-up bar Section 8 in Melbourne's CBD, leaving the staff unimpressed and the toilet in a mess.

'To the lovely couple who spent half an hour or so in our smaller (quite cramped) toilet yesterday afternoon, we found a small trace of a viscous liquid after you left that looks like it may belong to you,' Section 8 staff posted on their Facebook page.

'We weren't very busy at the time so will have no problem remembering your cheerful faces, so feel free to drop on by and we can return your property to you; as well as hand you an invoice for the 7 trillion litres of bleach we've subsequently been through.' 

On Thursday, the couple made contact with the bar to apologise for their actions, sending a cheeky note along with a tip to cover the cost of cleaning the bathroom.

'For those of you that followed our racy little drama a few weeks back, we received this anonymous card in the mail today that has restored our faith in humanity,' Section 8 posted on its Facebook page.

'To the staff at Section 8; just dropping you a friendly line to say sorry for any mess that we caused last week in your bathrooms,' the note read.

'Here's a tip we should have left instead of leaving evidence of our visit to your great bar...Cheers'. 

The bar seemed to be more than happy with the note and tip as an apology, signing off the saga with an invitation for the amorous couple to return.

'Thanks lovers, welcome to c** back for a beer anytime'.

The incident sparked a flurry of comments on the bar's Facebook page, with some followers of the page labelling the actions of the couple 'disgusting' and 'gross'.

However, many saw the humorous side to the situation, congratulating the couple on their 'sexcapade'.

'I know the smell of those dunnies always gets me in the mood. Who says romance is dead?' posted one social media user.

'More like Section 69 amiright', posted another, with a fellow Facebook user labelling the bar the 'mile low club'. 

One cheeky social media user said that the couple had 'left their Hallmark' on the bar.
