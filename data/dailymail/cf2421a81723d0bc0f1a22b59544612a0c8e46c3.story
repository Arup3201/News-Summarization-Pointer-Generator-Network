Loic Remy had a medical in Boston on Tuesday as he closed in on a £8.5million move to Liverpool.

Liverpool envisage no problems with his medical and expect the deal for the QPR striker to be completed in the next 36 hours having already agreed personal terms.

The France international flew out to America - where Brendan Rodgers squad are training at Harvard University - and will become Liverpool's fifth signing of an increasingly busy summer.

Liverpool bound: Loic Remy is close to completing a move to the Reds

The Departed: Remy will be hoping to replace Luis Suarez and form a partnership with Daniel Sturridge

Remy will give Liverpool more striking options following the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and there is increasing confidence that he will be joined by Dejan Lovren, who has been Rodgers' top central defensive target all summer.

Liverpool had a £20m bid for the Croat rebuffed in early June and though he was furious about that, threatening to stay away from St Mary's, Lovren reported back for pre-season training.

But he has had his heart set on move to Merseyside and it appears that Southampton, who had been looking to command a bigger fee, will grant Lovren his wish and, in the process, take the fees they have received from Liverpool during this window to £47.6m.

This will be the biggest outlay ever made by a Liverpool manager during one transfer window and Rodgers, after missing out on Swansea pair Ben Davies and Michel Vorm, is still looking for a left-back - a move for Sevilla's Alberto Moreno, who is a target for Napoli and Atletico Madrid, could yet be resurrected - and expects to add the promising young Belgium striker Divock Origi, who will be loaned back to Lille once his transfer is complete.

Key target: Liverpool remain interested in Southampton's Dejan Lovren

Assuming all goes to plan with Lovren, he will link up with Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, both of whom are among a squad of more than 30 - as is goalkeeper Pepe Reina - that have arrived in Boston.

Lambert is still on a high after making his first Liverpool appearance in the 2-1 win over Preston at Deepdale on Saturday when he played 50 minutes of the friendly and wore the club's famous No 9 shirt.

The England striker said: 'I was nervous before kick-off and I probably haven't been that nervous for a while. I've played in a lot of big games in my career and that's the most nervous I've been before a game for a while.

'I was a little bit disappointed not to get a goal but I thoroughly enjoyed it; it was a special moment for me and one I'll remember.'

Dream come true: Rickie Lambert is delighted to be playing for his beloved Liverpool
