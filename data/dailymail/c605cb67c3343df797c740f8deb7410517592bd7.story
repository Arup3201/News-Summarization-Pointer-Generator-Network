Britain's 'most vulgar' car, a Mercedes CLS 350 encrusted with one million Swarovski crystals has been sold on eBay for more than £150,000. 

Daria Radionova, a 21-year-old Russian student, listed the car on the online auctioneers after attracting attention in Knightsbridge, her plush west London stomping ground. 

Bids quickly escalated above £100,000, with the auction closing at £154,600 today after more than two dozen offers.

The Mercedes CLS 350, covered with a million Swarovski crystals, sold on eBay for more than £150,000 

Bling: The car - an early gift from her parents for her 21st birthday - also has an elite number plate 'BAII BYY'

After bidding opened at almost £90,000, the car was sold today after more than a week of bids for £154,600  

But despite vowing to donate proceeds of the sale to charity, Miss Radionova has revealed only some of the six-figure sum will be given to Manchester and Cheshire Dog's Home which perished in a fire earlier this year. 

Speaking before its sale, the privileged youngster said: 'The car is now for sale in the eBay charity auction. 

'A part from the sale will go to support Manchester and Moldova Dog Homes.'

It seems Miss Radionova was unsure of the website however, uploading a photograph of the listing this evening asking: 'Is eBay a serious auction btw guys? (sic)'  

The London-based student, who lives 300 feet from her favourite shop Harrods, boasted before putting the silver-coloured coupe on sale: 'When I sell the car I will give the money to charity.'

It was not clear last night if any other causes would benefit from the glittering car which was valued at around £25,000.

Miss Radionova disputed this, stating: 'The car cost at least £50,000, then I spent over £20,000 on the Swarovski crystals for it.

'It cost me another £15,000 to fly in my team from Russia to put them on the car for me.

'They spent 12 hours a day for two months doing it. I'm very happy with it - everywhere I go, people look at it.'

The car - an early gift from her parents for her 21st birthday - also has an elite number plate BAII BYY.

Magnet for theft: Daria Radionova said: 'It's quite scary to leave it in the street. People try to take the crystals. Every time I come back I have to check if any have gone'

The registration was a present from her brother 'to make sure my car was extra-unique'.

The eBay site says the starting bid was for £89,999.00. Twenty-five offers had been made before the final bid today.  

Asked on Facebook why she was helping dogs rather than children, orphans or disabled people, she snapped back: 'Help them yourself.'

Any buyers should be ready for unexpected attention with a car that has had two previous owners and 57,000 miles on the clock.

'It's quite scary to leave it in the street,' she said.

'People try to take the crystals. Every time I come back I have to check if any have gone.

'But I enjoy it. I know some people say negative things but I don't care what people think.'

The car garnered attention world-wide, including from sitcom star Ashton Kutcher
