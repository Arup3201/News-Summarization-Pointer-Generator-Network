A 'smart hat' could be the way of the future for Sydney cyclists with the idea being proposed as a safer alternative to the existing helmet.

Its main feature being a registration plate on the back of the helmet along with an integrated camera, headlight, brake lights, indicators, drop down visor and a wiper system.

The invention aims to combat the long-disputed issue of cyclists being registered road users like drivers.

But the concept has been met with widespread criticism from cyclist groups, some labelling it is as a 'stupid' idea.

The smart helmet also has automatic brake lights, head lights and night lights

The helmet also has a Bluetooth display with speaker, speedometer, speed zones, temperature, heart rate, tilt sensor, ultrasonic object proximity warning and turn signal indicators

The idea was put forward to Mosman Council - Sydney's north shore - by designer Toby King, which was welcomed by councillors who voted unanimously for the motion to be carried on Tuesday night.

Councillor Simon Menzies, who supports the smart hat, told Daily Mail Australia that councillors were 'enthused' by the idea.

'It's encouraging to see the product and we hope it becomes a reality,' he said.

In a detailed outline of the smart hat, Mr King wrote how current cycle helmets offer little protection to cyclists.

'Existing cycle helmets do not address any technical issues of integrating modern, electronic safety devices, data, or even standard road use indicators that are compulsory on all road registered vehicles,' he wrote.

He offers a solution to these issues - that being, the smart helmet.

The proposed helmet is said to be safer than the existing cycle helmet

There's also a separate storage compartment for smart phones on the back of the helmet

Mr King says the invention is 'aimed at increasing safety for the pushbike rider, other road users and pedestrians'. 

'Additional factors should be in protecting the rider from head trauma effectively plus the ability to see and ride safely in bad weather for them and be seen by other road users in the same conditions,' he wrote.

With the addition of licence plates on the back of the helmet, Mr King says this will allow for cyclists to be registered road users.

'Before now there has been no system available, which is readily adaptable and practical for cyclists in this regard,' Mr King wrote.

'It is the object of this product concept to attempt to rectify at least some of the deficiencies of existing practices in conjunction with regulatory authorities and associated organisations.'

Other features of the helmet include ultrasonic object proximity sensing, GPS navigation, speedometer, detecting speed zones, temperature and heart rate.

The proposal was introduced for council approval as a submission to the State Government as it is currently considering options to improve cycle safety on NSW roads.

However groups such as cycle.org.au took to their Facebook page to express their disgust over the smart helmet.

One baffled cyclist wrote: 'This is a great idea!! Said no cyclist ever.'

While others wrote: 'That's the most stupid design ever' and 'I wish I had words, but I just can't get past the stupid. And then that helmet.'
