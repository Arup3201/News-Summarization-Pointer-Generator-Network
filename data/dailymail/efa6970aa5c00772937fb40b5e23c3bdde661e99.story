The surviving son of fraudster Bernie Madoff has blamed the stress of living with his father's $65 billion Ponzi scheme for his cancer relapse.

Andrew Madoff, 47, said that his mantle-cell lymphoma had been in remission for 10 years until his father was revealed as a fraudster in 2008 and his brother subsequently committed suicide in 2010.

'One way to think of this is the 
scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,' 
Andrew told People magazine. 'And it's killing me slowly.'

Relapse: Andrew Madoff, the son of fraudster Bernie Madiff, has claimed that the stress of his father's financial scandal and arrest sparked his 2012 cancer relapse and is 'killing him slowly'

Andrew Madoff, himself a trader in his father's New York-based company, has always denied knowing anything about the scheme which sent his father to a North Carolina prison for 150 years in 2009.

'I will never forgive him for what he did,' he said. 'He's already dead to me. I feel horrible for the people whose lives have been destroyed by my father's crimes.'

He first battled the rare cancer in 2003 and has been undergoing annual tests to check that he has not relapsed. He said he was 'blindsided' to learn it had returned in October last year.

'I had no symptoms,' he said. 'I felt fine.'

Now he will undergo a stem cell 
transplant at the end of this month in the hopes of kicking the disease.
He revealed his fears to People.

'My cousin died from the side effects of his stem-cell transplant, so that's on my mind,' he said.

Andrew
was diagnosed shortly after reconciling with his mother, Ruth, whom he 
and his brother Mark had shunned after she stood by their father in the 
wake of the scandal.

But he added that he has no interest in reconciling with his father.

Bernie was arrested on December 11, 
2008, following his $65 billion Ponzi scheme which became the largest 
financial fraud in history. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009.

The charges included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money 
laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee 
benefit plan and making false filings with the SEC.

Andrew told People that when he and his brother turned his father in, it was 'at the same time the easiest decision I ever had to make and the hardest'.

Struggling to deal with the revelations, Mark Madoff, 46, hanged himself in his apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, as his two-year-old son was asleep in the room next door.

'My brother did not like to lean on his friends for support,' Andrew said. 'And he suffered alone because of it.'

Fears: Madoff, with his fiance Catherine Hooper, will undergo a stem cell transplant this month

The other Madoffs have always claimed to have known nothing about Bernie's Ponzi scheme.

Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies.

No family members have been criminally charged.
