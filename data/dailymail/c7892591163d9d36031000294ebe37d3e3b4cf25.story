'Let me in': Betting shop robber Timothy Stern, 31, did not like being far from his family

A convict on the run from jail stunned guards when he knocked on the door of another prison and asked to be let in.

Timothy Stern, 31, begged officials at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire to let him come back after escaping from an open prison more than 70 miles away.

The betting shop robber said he wanted to return to the high-security jail to be closer to his family.

Stern’s good behaviour had seen him transferred to minimum-security Leyhill, near Bristol, in August.

But he walked out and turned up at his old jail 24 hours later asking to be let in.

He is now back at his preferred prison, but has had 21 days added to his sentence.

Stern walked out of open prison HMP Leyhill, in Wotton-Under-Edge near Bristol, on September 26, Oxford Crown Court was told.

Within a day, he walked up to the gates at Bullingdon in Arncott, Oxfordshire, and asked to be let in.

Instead Stern, who was serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for the knifepoint robbery, was asked to sit on a grass verge for the police to arrive.

Cathy Olliver, prosecuting, said he was transfered to the open prison from Bullingdon for good behaviour in August.

But, Stern was unhappy at being so far away from his Oxford family and after failing to move to a much closer prison decided to escape.

Peter Du Feu, defending, said that after escaping from prison in Bristol, his client was on the loose for 24 hours.

He said he went to visit his partner and three children, before heading back to Bullingdon The barrister said: 'He knocked on the door and asked to be let back in.

Where he wanted to be: Bullingdon, near his family in Oxford, is more than 70 miles from the prison he was in

Too far: Stern was moved to Leyhill in Bristol for good behaviour. But he said it was too far from his family

Sentenced: Stern had 21 days added to his sentence for robbing a betting shop but gets to stay where he wants

'They said they couldn’t possibly let him in, but could he sit on the verge and wait for the police.

'The nature of open prisons is to try to integrate prisoners back into the community, which clearly he couldn’t do so far away.

'He was only free for 24 hours and then went back to Bullingdon. He has been there since.'

Judge Mary Jane Mowat sentenced Stern of Blackbird Leys Road, Blackbird Leys, Oxford, to a further 21 days inside.

She told Stern: 'Prisoners have got to obey the rules.'
