An inmate who claims to be a practicing Jedi has accused prison bosses of 'intolerance and bigotry' after they refused to recognise his Star Wars-based beliefs.

The prisoner at HMP & YOI Isis, a 622-capacity category C centre for young offenders on the HMP Belmarsh site in south London, said he was being denied his ‘right’ to follow the religion, which is based on the Star Wars films.

The unnamed prisoner - who says he fears ‘retaliation from the
 Dark Side’ if he is identified - said he was unhappy his right to religious freedom was 
being denied.

'I recently put in an application asking that I be allowed to practise my religion freely - I am a Jedi,' he said, writing in prisoners’ magazine Inside 
Time.

'The
 written reply said "Whilst Jedi is a recognised religion according to 
the UK census, it is not recognised by the National Offender Management 
Service and we cannot change your religious record because of this".

'This is an example of the kind of 
intolerance and religious bigotry faced by members of our faith on a 
daily basis, both within the prison system and without.

'Jedis
 have been portrayed very negatively in the media ever since the tragic 
battle of Yavin IV, when Luke Skywalker and a group of left-wing 
militants targeted the Death Star in a terrorist attack, killing 
thousands of civilian personnel.

'Please withhold my name in the paper as I fear retaliation from the Dark Side. May the force be with you.'

The religion, which preaches meditation 
and ‘accessing ancient inner knowledge’ before making decisions, was 
officially recognised in the 2001 UK census, when it was the fourth most popular in the UK.

According to group Temple Of The Jedi Order, those who follow Jediism are not role players, and are not the same as the fictional characters in the Star Wars films.

Instead followers believe in the principles of Jediism, which includes 'Peace, Justice, Love, Learning and Benevolence'.

Jedis also strive to bring about a greater level of spiritual awareness, compassion and a greater understanding of the universe and those living within it.

Another group, Jedi Church, says Jedis believ in an all-powerful force which binds all things in the universe together, an is innate inside everyone.

Many followers keep to the ‘21 maxims of Jediism’, which include ‘seeking excellence 
in all endeavours’, ‘seeking the path of the right’, ‘acting with 
honour’, and to ‘trusting the ways of the force’.

In the film series, created by George Lucas, the monastic Jedi are trained to use the Force through passive meditation as well as practicing altruism, mercy, and a commitment to justice while rejecting emotions including love, passion, fear, anger and hate.

The word 'jedi' is believed to have be to have been derived by Lucas from the Japanese 'jidaigeki'.

In the films, Jedis have ‘no strict guidelines’, but
 are known for keeping lightsabers, wearing ‘hooded robes’, and for 
going into ‘meditative states’.

Real life followers
 keep to the ‘21 maxims of Jediism’, which include ‘seeking excellence 
in all endeavours’, ‘seeking the path of the right’, ‘acting with 
honour’, and to ‘trusting the ways of the force’.

More than 390,000 people listed their religion as 'Jedi' in to 2001 census, however many were thought to have done so as a joke or a form of protest.

In the 2012 census this figure dropped to 177,000 - still enough to make it the seventh most popular religion in the UK.

In 2001 it was only beaten by Christianity (70 per cent), Muslim (3.1 per cent) and Hindu (2.1 per cent) after notching up 0.7 per cent of those polled.

In the 2012 census it was in seventh place, excluding those who said they had ‘no religion’ or chose not to answer - behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Buddhism.

The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) currently recognises 18 religions, including Rastafarianism, Quakerism, Zoroastrianism and Paganism.

One former prisoner, who asked not to be named, said: 'If the prison service say it’s alright to be a pagan in prison and carry little twigs about pretending they are wands or a spiritualist who believes they can speak to the dead, then I think it should be alright for a prisoner to be a Jedi.

'It’s discrimination, pure and simple - especially as it is now a recognised religion on the census.'

A spokesman for the Prison Service said 
that Jediism was 'not a recognised religion' and refused to comment on 
'individual cases'.

Bad press: The unnamed prisoner said Jedis had been portrayed negatively in the media since Luke Skywalker (right) and a group of left-wing militants targeted the Death Star

In 2010, a man who described himself as a 'Star Wars follower' and 'Jedi Knight' was thrown out of a Jobcentre in Southend, Essex, for refusing to remove his hood, and later received an apology.

A spokesman of the Jedi Church said: 'The Jedi Church believes that there is one all powerful force that binds all things in the universe together.

'The Jedi religion is something innate inside everyone of us, the Jedi Church believes that our sense of morality is innate. So quiet your mind and listen to the force within you!'
