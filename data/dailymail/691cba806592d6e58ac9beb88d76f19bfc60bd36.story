William Goad was jailed in 2004 for child abuse and died in prison today

A paedophile who abused up to 3,500 boys over a 35-year period has died in prison.

William Goad, 68, from Plymouth, Devon, who was jailed for life in 2004, died of natural causes at HMP Albany on the Isle of Wight, according to the Prison Service.

The wealthy businessman is thought to have been Britain’s most prolific child abuser, with his sick assaults causing two of his victims to commit suicide.

Goad was previously described in court as a ‘voracious, calculating, predatory and violent homosexual paedophile’ who boasted of beating his own ‘record’ of abusing 142 boys in a year.

The court was told: ‘It is believed there has been no single defendant with more victims than his man.’

A spokeswoman said today: ‘HMP Albany prisoner, William Goad, was pronounced dead at 00.20 on October 20 2012.

‘He is believed to have died from natural causes.

‘As with all deaths in custody, the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation.’

Goad was jailed for a minimum term of six years after being convicted at Plymouth Crown Court of 14 serious sex assaults and two indecent assaults.

Plymouth Crown Court was told he groomed his victims, aged between eight-years-old and 18-years-old, by offering them well-paid jobs in the string of shops and market stalls he owned, before inviting them back to his home.

In 2010 one of Goad's victims, Ray Zolla from Newquay, was awarded a six-figure sum in damages for the abuse he suffered as a teenager.He said at the time the abuse had ‘totally consumed’ his life.
