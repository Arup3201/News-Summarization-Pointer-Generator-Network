Five managers begin the Premier League season next weekend believing they will be champions.

Arsene Wenger, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini are all serial trophy-winners with bags of experience. But if they expect their rookie rival, 41-year-old Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, to be intimidated despite not having a medal to his name, they will be disappointed.

‘I don’t lack confidence and I have an inherent belief in how I work,’ said Rodgers, whose side came from nowhere to finish runners-up to Manchester City last season.

Young gun: Brendan Rodgers does not think his relative inexperience wills top Liverpool challenging for title

‘I’ve been doing this for 20 years now, and I love the challenge of working out my opponent and the different systems they might play.’

With so many big beasts around him, there are many who think Rodgers may suffer from ‘second-season syndrome’ where the team crash back to earth, particularly having sold their best player, Luis Suarez, to Barcelona.

But they underestimate the Ulsterman, who learned his trade as a coach at Chelsea under Mourinho and has rebuilt Liverpool admirably while coping with the retirement of Jamie Carragher and the ageing of Steven Gerrard.

Wenger, Pellegrini and Van Gaal are in their 60s with either Premier League or Champions League silverware to their name. Mourinho, 51, has won both — in duplicate.

Rodgers has signed seven players to cope with Suarez’s exit and the extra playing load of the Champions League. More are set to follow.

He is sure that while he may lack long-term experience at the highest level, nobody in any Premier League dug-out will beat him for detailed organisation.

‘Towards the end of last season, for example, when we played Norwich it was Neil Adams’s first home game as manager,’ he said.

‘I did all my homework, as I would if we were playing Chelsea or Manchester City. I looked at how Neil’s teams had played when he was youth-team coach, what system he liked to play, and I looked at his entire history as a coach. He liked the diamond system, so we played a way to counter and combat that.’

Rodgers did not need to remind anyone Liverpool won 3-2 when the fixture was played in April. ‘I always do my work,’ he said.

He may be well behind Van Gaal, Mourinho and others on his CV at the moment but it is not his intention to finish like that. ‘I’m 41. Hopefully I’ve got another 20-odd years left in the game and I will have success in that period,’ he said.
