The parents of a teenager who died after taking a ‘designer drug’ yesterday condemned the supplier for effectively murdering her.

Poppy Rodgers, 16, collapsed after ignoring a friend’s warning not to try 4-methylamphetamine, a Class A drug.

She was ‘poisoned’ by Luke Carey, 25, who bragged about buying the drug, a derivative of amphetamine (speed), at a cheap rate and knew that the batch was blamed for the death of a 22-year-old man a year earlier.

Carey, who admitted seven charges 
related to the supply of drugs, was jailed for six years and five months
at York Crown Court yesterday in what Judge Michael Mettyear described 
as a ‘truly tragic case’.

The teenager’s father, Mark, said 
outside court: ‘I understand in law this might not be murder but, given 
the circumstances, it certainly feels like that to us.

‘Adults may choose to take drugs but those prepared to give drugs to a child, they are beyond reproach.

‘Carey gave this poison to my little girl with the full knowledge that it had already killed someone.’

Poppy was at a friend’s house in York 
in April last year when Carey produced a bag of drugs he claimed was 
ecstasy and she tried some.

Nicholas Worsley, prosecuting, said 
Poppy’s eyes began rolling and she was sweating heavily ‘but despite 
this Carey asked her if she wanted more’.

Paramedics were called but she died in hospital. One of her friends was also taken to hospital but survived.

Police searched Carey’s house and found a bag of the substance with an estimated street value of £1,400.

He initially denied any wrongdoing and
claimed others in the house were trying to set him up, the court heard.
But he pleaded guilty on the day he was due to stand trial.

Carey was aware the strong drugs had 
been linked to the death of John Causer the previous May and yet gave it
out and tried some himself.

Poppy’s mother, Ann, said in a 
statement: ‘The day that Carey gave my child poison not only ended her 
life but took mine too. Everyday hurts. I feel pain I never knew 
existed.

‘Grief consumes me every minute of 
every day. Some days I cope more than others. Some days I don’t cope at 
all. Some days I wish I never woke up.’

Richard Reed, defending, said Carey 
enjoyed getting high with other people. ‘He will have to live for the 
rest of his life with the consequences of his actions,’ he said.

Detective Chief Inspector Nigel 
Costello of North Yorkshire Police said: ‘Carey played roulette with a 
life that wasn’t his own. She was naive and he exploited that.’
