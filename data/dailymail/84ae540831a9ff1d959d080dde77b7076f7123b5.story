The mother of Jerome Murdough, pictured while serving in the Marine Corps, is suing the city after his death at Rikers Island, New York on February 15

The mother of a mentally ill, homeless veteran who was found dead in a 100-degree New York City jail cell that overheated due to an equipment malfunction in February plans to file a $25 million wrongful death lawsuit against the city.

Alma Murdough's attorney, Derek Sells, said he will also ask the city to preserve all communications and 911 recordings regarding former Marine Jerome Murdough's death on Rikers Island.

Sells scheduled a news conference for Friday afternoon.

He filed a notice of claim, the first procedural step necessary for a civil suit against the city, with the comptroller's office on April 30 on behalf of the inmate's 75-year-old mother.Â 

In it, he writes that the 56-year-old 
Murdough's death was caused by carelessness and negligence by Department
 of Correction employees.

Prosecutors in the Bronx are investigating the death.

'This
 case involves a tragic incident and we will review the lawsuit and 
respond accordingly,' said Nick Paolucci, a spokesman for the city's law
 department.

Corrections officials have declined to comment, citing the ongoing criminal investigation.

It
 was first reported in March on suspicions about Murdough's cause of 
death. One official who spoke at the time on the condition of anonymity 
described him as having 'basically baked to death'.

Citing a preliminary DOC investigation, court documents filed last month in a separate federal court case show that Murdough's internal body temperature, taken nearly four hours after he was discovered unresponsive in his cell in the early hours of February 15, was 103 degrees.

Alma Murdough and her daughter Cheryl Warner hold a photo of Murdough's son, at her home in Queens, New York.  Jerome Murdough, a mentally ill, homeless former Marine arrested for sleeping in the roof landing of a New York City public housing project during one of the coldest recorded winters in city history, died last month in a Rikers Island jail cell that multiple city officials say was at least 100 degrees when his body was discovered

It said the cell was 101 degrees. Murdough was slumped at the edge of the foot of his bed with 'a pool of vomit and blood on the floor,' the documents said.

A spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office says the exact cause and manner of Murdough's death have not yet been determined, pending further studies.

But the court documents show the medical examiner investigator assigned to Murdough's case preliminarily found he likely died of hyperthermia.

Murdough was on psychotropic medication at the time of his death, which experts say can make people sensitive to heat. DOC officials have said he was left unattended for hours.

Murdough was arrested February 7 on a misdemeanor trespassing charge for sleeping in an enclosed stairwell on the roof of a Harlem public housing building, during one of New York's coldest winters on record.

He was sent to Rikers Island after being unable to make $2,500 bail, according to court records.

A letter kept by Mrs Murdough shows her son's promotion in the U.S. Marines from 1975. He died, homeless and battling a mental illness in a New York prison earlier this year
