Injured: Lawrence O'Donnell, 62, has been hurt in a car accident and is undergoing unspecified treatment in New York

MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell has been inured in a car accident and is expected to be off the air for several weeks while he recovers.

The network put out a statement about the accident on Tuesday morning but gave few details about the host's injuries.

They said that O'Donnell and his brother Michael were traveling outside of the United States and got into an accident while riding a taxi.

They were treated by local doctors- though the location of the accident was not revealed- and have since been transferred back to the United States.

Lawrence, 62, is being treated in New York and Michael is being seen by doctors in their hometown of Boston.

The network said that both men are expected to make a full recovery but that will take at least a few weeks in the case of the MSNBC host.

His colleague Alex Wagner will take over O'Donnell's show 'The Last Word' on Tuesday night and Ari Melber will take on the task on Wednesday and Thursday.

O'Donnell has hosted the 10pm news analysis show since 2010.

It is unclear where the O'Donnells were when the accident occurred, and the liberal host did not leave any clues about his trip on his Twitter feed.

On April 6, he posted a Tweet about the long-anticipated good weather in New York, but since then the rest of his updates were about the day's news or various retweets from other journalists and MSNBC feeds.
