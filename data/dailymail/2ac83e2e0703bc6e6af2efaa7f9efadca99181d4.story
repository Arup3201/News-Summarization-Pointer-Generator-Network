A couple have vowed to fight for justice after their three-month-old daughter died just hours after being sent home from A&E. 

Alisha Pullen and Luke Gloster took baby Esme to Royal Stoke University Hospital in December where doctors diagnosed the infant with bronchiolitis and sent the family home. 

Six hours later Miss Pullen, 20, discovered her daughter had stopped breathing in her cot. 

They were rushed back to the hospital by ambulance where the baby was pronounced dead on arrival. 

Esme Gloster died six hours after being sent home from A&E. The three-month-old's parents, Alisha Pullen and Luke Gloster, are now demanding answers as to why they were sent away by doctors

A coroner's investigation has been launched into Esme's death with her distraught parents demanding answers as to why they were sent away by health workers. 

Describing the heartbreaking moment she realised her child had died, Miss Pullen said: ''When we got there, I knew from the man’s face. I just needed to hear it for it to be real.

'I fell to the floor. I just couldn't believe what was going on.

'I could not believe that I was going to hold my baby in my arms, dead.

'It was just horrible.'

Miss Pullen, a first-time mother, first visited a walk-in health centre after noticing her daughter having difficulty breathing on December 13.

After showing no signs of improvement the infant was taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital where doctors said she would likely recover at home. 

'We took our little girl to professionals on two occasions,' she added. 

'I feel they could have done so much more to prevent whatever has happened to her.'

Timothy Jones, Esme's grandfather, said he believed more could have been done to save his granddaughter's life.

'I believe that if they had kept her in, or transferred her to another hospital, then she would still be with us,' the 42-year-old said.

'I’m finding it hard to believe that nothing could have been done.

'Since this happened we have heard that children who die from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome show signs of illness beforehand.

'Esme was showing signs of illness, so why wasn’t she kept in hospital and observed?

'I just can’t fathom it.'

Experts have suggested Esme's death was the result of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome after a post-mortem examination returned an inconclusive result.  

Dr Martin Samuels, Consultant Paediatrician, and an expert on the syndrome, at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, said: 'Minor symptoms are very common in babies.

'If you look at cot death victims who are classified subsequently as having died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome it’s common that there are going to be minor symptoms before a death arises.

'In my experience it is important that we offer support for families who have lost a child to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and our team has continued to remain in contact with the family.

'There are support groups, such as The Lullaby Trust, which is a charitable organisation, which also support families whose babies have died suddenly and unexpectedly.' 

Esme's parents are now demanding justice for their daughter's death which, they claim, could have been prevented
