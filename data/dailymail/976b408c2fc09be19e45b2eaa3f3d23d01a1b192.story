The family of a New York woman who died last month say there's no way she's resting in peace after her body was transported to a funeral home without her organs inside.

The family of Rhoda Callwood, of Westchester County, ordered two autopsy's after her death last mont at the age of 82.

After the first at New York Presbyterian Hospital, Mrs Callwood's remains were delivered to the office of the New York City Medical Examiner - but her internal organs were not present.

Outrage: When the medical examiner received Ms Callwood's remains, the body was without organs, which were picked up separately - in buckets

The organs were picked 
up the next day - in two buckets.

Several days later, the body was delivered in the same condition to the John F. X. McKeon and Son Funeral Home in the Bronx, which handled her burial.

Funeral Director Bill Curran told ABC 7: 'The body arrived to the funeral home in the New York City Medical Examiner's body bag, but the organs were separated.

'The organs were in two plastic containers separate from the body.'

The Medical Examiner's told the station 
that it did not want to cut Mrs Callwood's body up again because Mr 
Curran would be preparing the body to be buried.

So for Mrs Callwood's burial last week, the organs were placed alongside her in the coffin.

The actions of both the hospital and the medical examiner's office have left the woman's anguished family stunned.

Glenda Callwood, the dead woman's daughter, told ABC 7: 'I am so confused with everything going on, I don't have time to mourn, really.'

Even Mr Curran was flabbergasted by the situation.

He told the station: 'I have been a 
funeral director for 20 years now and I have never seen a body 
transferred without the organs inside.'

Ms Callwood's family has now lawyered up

Their attorney, Bonita Zelman told ABC 7: 'It's not the Medical Examiner's office to decide to throw in the organs that may or may not belong to the mother into two buckets and then deliver them that way. The family is horrified now.'

A rep for New York Presbyterian Hospital told the station: 'We sympathize with the family in the loss of their loved one.'

The hospital added: 'The Medical Examiner's office says it didn't intend to add to the family's grief, but their normal protocol is to put organs back in bodies.'
