Two of the country's largest retailers have announced that they're staying open 24/7 between now and Christmas Day as they attempt to compensate for the shorter than usual holiday shopping season.

Toys-R-Us announced on Tuesday that it plans to be open around-the-clock - 87 straight hours - from 6 a.m. on Dec. 21 to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve.

Department store Kohl’s has also announced that it is going 24/7 and will stay open for 
100 straight hours from Dec. 20 to Dec. 24.

Retailers are growing concerned about sales this Christmas because the holiday shopping season is six days shorter than last year due to Thanksgiving falling on Nov. 28, the latest it possibly can

‘With only eight shopping days remaining until Christmas, we are offering customers extended, uninterrupted time in stores, providing them the opportunity to shop whenever is most convenient for them - whether early in the morning or late at night,’ said Troy Rice, executive vice president of stores and services at Toy-R-Us.

The retail giant has 877 stores across the country and its Times Square branch hasn’t closed since the start of December. It will hit 566 straight hours of business when it closes at 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve.

So far other retailers have avoided the urge to open non-stop, but that could quickly change if they become concerned about losing a competitive advantage to the likes of Kohl’s and Toy-R-Us.

Retailers including Macy's, Nordstrom and Target are all opening for longer periods of time in the run up to Christmas, while Walmart is already a 24/7 destination.

Many Macy's stores have started extended hours this week, opening from 7 a.m. to midnight through to Thursday. Opening times remain the same Friday through Monday, Dec. 23, but stores will remain open longer, closing at 2 a.m.

‘Not everybody works the traditional 9-to-5 hours, but they still need to buy something. The Christmas shopping season is much shorter this year,’ Macy's spokesperson Elina Kazan told USA Today. ‘Extending those hours is absolutely a customer service initiative.’

Hours at Nordstrom stores vary but many begin extended hours Wednesday, Dec. 18, through Monday, Dec. 23, opening at 8 a.m. and closing at 11, with Christmas Eve hours of 8 a.m.-6 p.m.

Bloomingdale'sare open from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. in the run-up to Christmas.

Extended hours start Friday at Target with stores open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. or 12 a.m., and then 7 a.m.-12 a.m. from Saturday, Dec. 21, to Monday, Dec .23. On Christmas Eve, stores will be open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.

Kmart will also have longer Christmas Eve hours this year, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.

This Friday, Saturday and Sunday likely will rank in the top four busiest shopping days of the season, following Black Friday, according to ShopperTrak.

The announcement of extended hours also comes after snow and freezing rain from the Midwest to the Northeast contributed to a nearly nine percent year-over-year decline in store foot traffic for the week ended Dec. 13, according to ShopperTrak estimates.

Department store Kohl¿s has announced that it is opening 24/7 and will stay open for 100 straight hours from Dec. 20 to Dec. 24.
