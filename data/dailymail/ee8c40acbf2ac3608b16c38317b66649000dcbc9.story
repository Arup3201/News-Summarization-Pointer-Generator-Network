Firestarter: Casey Fury pleaded guilty to starting a fire on a nuclear sub that caused $450 of damage

A former shipyard worker has pleaded guilty to starting a fire that caused $450 million in damage to a nuclear-powered submarine so that he could get out of work after troubles with an ex-girlfriend.

Casey James Fury, from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, pleaded guilty to two counts of arson on Thursday under a plea agreement that could send him to federal prison for nearly 20 years.

The 24-year-old painter and sand blaster pleaded guilty to starting the fire, which carries a maximum of life in federal prison - but the defense and prosecution agreed to recommend a sentence of between 15 and 19 years.

Fury told Navy investigators that he started the fire on the USS Miami - and another outside the submarine - on May 23 as he was suffering from anxiety and having problems with his ex-girlfriend.

Flames ripped through the submarine which was dry docked at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, and it took more than 100 firefighters 12 hours to bring the fire under control.

The fire had spread to spaces within the submarine that were difficult to reach, making it challenging for firefighters to combat to blaze, but the nuclear reactor remained in tact throughout.

Five people were hurt while putting out the fire and the Navy faces years of repairs on the near-destroyed submarine.

After an initial investigation, the 
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard said the fire started in a vacuum cleaner used
by shipyard workers. It had been stored in an 'unoccupied space', they 
said.

At first authorities thought they would have to scrap the submarine, but the military concluded the USS Miami can carry 
enough of a workload in the future to make it worth carrying out the repairs.

Navy Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of 
Naval operations, estimated they will cost about $450 million. It is expected to return to service in 2015.

Damage from the fire was limited to the forward compartment spaces, which include crew living and command and control spaces, Rear Admiral Rick Breckenridge said in a statement at the time.

There was no damage to the submarine's nuclear
reactor, located at the rear of the vessel. It had been shut down for 
more than two months while work was carried out on the submarine.

The submarine, which is based in Croton, Connecticut, arrived at the shipyard in March. It typically carries a crew of 13 officers and 120 enlisted personnel.

According to the Navy's Vessel Register, USS Miami, an attack submarine, was commissioned in 1990, is 362 feet long, and is nuclear powered.

Fury also pleaded guilty to setting a second fire in the dry dock area below the submarine, which was quickly extinguished and caused no injuries.

David Beneman, Fury's attorney, said he anticipated that sentencing would occur in March.
