Disgraced Toronto mayor Rob Ford joined local boy made good Drake at a press conference on Monday to announce that the NBA All-Star game is coming to the city in 2016.

Since allegations surfaced back in May that Mayor Ford had been filmed smoking crack, he has been taking every opportunity to try and rehabilitate his damaged image.

A month ago Ford 'beat' wrestling legend Hulk Hogan in an arm wrestling match and on Monday he couldn’t resist the opportunity to be pictured alongside one of the city’s favorite sons.

Rapper Drake and Toronto Mayor Rob Ford were pictured together at a press conference to announce that the Toronto Raptors will host the 2016 NBA All-Star game

It was also announced that Drake has a new role as ‘global ambassador’ for the city’s baseball team, the Toronto Raptors, and he will even have a voice in rebranding the team.

The hip hop star is well known for his ‘nice guy’ image which is at odds with a number of other rap stars – and even the mayor of his hometown. 

While Drake looked every inch the lady’s man in his blue suit, it was in sharp contrast to the rotund Ford who was wearing an ill-fitting suit and constantly mopped at his sweaty brow.

Social media was abuzz with people who couldn’t resist the opportunity to comment on Toronto’s very own version of the odd couple.

‘Toronto may be the only city on earth where the breakout rap star has a cleaner image than the mayor,’ tweeted @goldsbie.

‘Drake is to hip hop what Rob Ford is to healthy living’ chimed in @dcos9.

While @seanjunor added: ‘Mayor Rob Ford spent the day with Drake. An album full of content emerged. Thug life mayor’

It was back in May when allegations first emerged that there was video footage in existence that showed him smoking crack. 

His supposed dealers tried shopping the tape to news outlets including Gawker and the Toronto Star, but neither could come up with the $200,000 requested.

Eventually Gawker lost contact with the person selling the video and when they resurfaced the source said it was 'gone'.

The match-up with Hogan back in August may have been one attempt on Ford's part to draw attention away from the video.

Then came Monday’s press conference to announce that Toronto will hold the league’s annual showcase for the first time.

Tim Lieweke, president and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, said the team is in the process of planning a major facelift that will include a new look and new colors in time for 2016.

Drake will be heavily involved in the effort, which is expected to take the next two seasons.

‘I’m really out here with the people. I’m in touch with what they want to see,’ Drake said.

‘I really just want excitement for this team. I want us to be one of the biggest teams in the league.' Lieweke called this the beginning of a 'new age' for the Raptors.

But the Raptors have a long way to go on the court. They haven’t made the playoffs since 2008.
