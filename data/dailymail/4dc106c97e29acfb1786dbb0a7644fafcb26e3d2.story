A judge's 'game-changing' decision to tell the ex-wife of a millionaire racehorse surgeon to ‘get a job’ could mean that more divorced women will now have to support themselves after children turn seven.

Tracey Wright, 51, argued she should continue to receive £75,000-a-year maintenance  from her wealthy former husband Ian, but Lord Justice Pitchford ruled she should not be 'supported for life'.

The former riding instructor never got a job following her split with the equine surgeon after 11 years of marriage, but after losing her case she and other women may have to when children grow up. 

Senior lawyers said today that mothers will now have to be more self-sufficient from their rich ex-husbands and ‘spousal maintenance is no longer a meal ticket for life’.

'Game-changer': Tracey Wright was told to 'get a job' by a High Court judge after losing her maintenance battle with former husband Ian Wright, which could see many divorced mothers being forced into work

Mr and Mrs Wright’s £1.3million seven-bedroom home, set in 16 acres of Suffolk countryside, was sold and the proceeds divided following their divorce in 2008.

Mrs Wright had argued for continued maintenance to support their two children, but this was thrown out at the Court of Appeal yesterday and she was urged to get back to work. She says has been ‘made to feel like a criminal for putting my children first’.

The judge’s decision is a landmark ruling that will threaten the ‘norm’ of divorcees receiving generous ongoing payments.

The presumption in English law is that wealthy ex- husbands will support their former wives with ‘spousal maintenance’ payments.

But yesterday’s decision raises the possibility that this is ‘on the wane’. 

Charlotte Posnansky, of law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, said the case meant that spousal maintenance could end once children reach school age.

Experts said today the landmark ruling could now end indefinite payments for former partners of wealthy spouses, and change divorce cases in Britain for good.

Mei-Ling McNab, a family law partner at Brachers, said: 'This landmark decision will be a game-changer for future big ticket divorce cases. 

'It confirms mothers with children aged over seven should support themselves. 

'This decision is the first step towards self-sufficiency for women on the basis that despite being mothers, they are likely to have an earning capacity and therefore a responsibility to maintain themselves'.

Elizabeth Hicks, family law expert at Irwin Mitchell, said the landmark case was the latest in which judges made it plain ‘spousal maintenance is no longer a meal ticket for life’.

Charlotte Posnansky, of law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, added: ‘For the last 14 years, the pendulum has swung heavily in favour of women when considering the financial implications upon divorce … [it] seems to be swinging back again.’

London has become the 'divorce capital of the world' because ex-wives have chosen British courts to bumper payouts from their rich former husbands. 

In November financier's wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn, who is American, was awarded £337million in what could be Britain’s biggest ever divorce settlement from Sir Chris Hohn.

The pair – who have homes in London, the US and West Indies – had fought over assets totalling more than £700 million at the High Court. 

In 2011 Galina Besharova was awarded up to £200million  as part of her divorce from late billionaire Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, 

Last month Baroness Deech, former chair of the Bar Standards Board, said Britain's divorce laws should be tougher on women because they are encouraged to shun work and 'find a footballer' to marry.

She says as the law stands young women are sent the 'bad message' to find someone rich and 'once you are married you need never go out to work'.

'Never mind about A levels or a degree or taking the Bar course — come out and find a footballer,' she said.

She believes that couples should settle the terms of their divorce before their wedding and this would stop women marrying successful men and then running off with a large share of their wealth.

The peer is currently backing a House of Lords bill that would make prenuptial and postnuptial agreements agreements legally binding.

She said: 'We have a whole area of law which says once you are married you need never go out to work, [that] you are automatically entitled to everything you might need even if that marriage breaks down and it's your fault.' 

For more than a decade London has been considered 'the divorce capital of the world' and led to 'divorce tourism' by ex-wives from all over the world seeking bumper payouts.

The flexibility given to judges presiding over divorce proceedings in England and Wales means spouses are more likely to receive generous maintenance payments than in other countries. 

In November American Jamie Cooper-Hohn was awarded £330million in what is believed to be Britain's most expensive ever divorce case.

Her ex-husband Sir Chris Hohn, pictured right, did however manage to deny her an equal share of the couple’s vast wealth.

Mrs Cooper-Hohn raised their four children and ran the charitable foundations into which her husband poured most of the money made.

The judge said, however, that he had also played a major role in managing the charities and that the couple would have no £870million fortune to divide without him.

This ruling is likely to have a significant impact on future divorce rows. 

In 2011 Galina Besharova was awarded up to £200million as part of her divorce from late billionaire Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky,  

Other generous settlements include that awarded to Heather Mills following the break down of her marriage to Sir Paul McCartney 2008. Following the four-year marriage, Miss Mills received £24.3million.

Michelle Young was awarded a £20million sum after parting ways with her 'bankrupt' husband Scot Young, who fell to his death

In 2006 Beverley Charman, the former wife of insurance magnate John Charman was awarded a £48million settlement by the English courts in proceedings which took two years. 

Mr Charman appealed the decision but the pay out, which made legal history at the time, was upheld in 2007.
