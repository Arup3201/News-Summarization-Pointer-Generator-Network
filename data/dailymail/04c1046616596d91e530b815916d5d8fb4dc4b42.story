Iran defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2-0 in a World Cup warm-up on Sunday played on a training ground that was empty apart from a few journalists.

Ehsan Haji Safi scored late in the first half and Dutch-born Reza Ghoochannejhad, who plays for Championship side Charlton Athletic, added a goal early in the second.

Iran dominated on a windswept field in northeast Sao Paulo, with about two dozen media looking on at the practice facility where the Iranians have been working out.

Tidy finish: Reza Ghoochannejhad made it 2-0 to Iran, slotting past Trinidad keeper Jan Micahel Williams

Haji Safi put Iran ahead in the second minute of first-half stoppage time after Trinidad failed to clear a corner kick by Fulham's Ashkan Dejagah. Ghoochannejhad doubled the lead from about 10 yards about five minutes into the second half.

Javad Nekounam's penalty kick early in the second half was saved by goalkeeper Jan Michael Williams after Dejagah was fouled in the penalty area.

Battle: Iran face a tough task if they are to get out of a group including Argentina and Nigeria in Brazil

Iran opened its World Cup preparations with three warm-ups in Austria, 0-0 draws against Belarus and Montenegro, then a 1-1 draw with Angola.

Getting ready for its fifth World Cup appearance and first since 2006, the 43rd-ranked Iranians open against Nigeria on June 16, then play Argentina and close the group stage against Bosnia-Herzegovina.
