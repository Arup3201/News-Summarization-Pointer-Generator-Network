Neanderthals are thought to have been brutish and ruthless creatures, stopping at nothing to survive their harsh environment.

But, it turns out, we may have underestimated our distant cousins.

New research reveals Neanderthals made good parents and their children were well-cared for as part of the social group.

Happy families: Archaeologists at the University of York have challenged the traditional view that Neanderthal childhood was difficult, short and dangerous

This is according to British 
researchers who have challenged the traditional view that Neanderthal 
childhood was difficult, short and dangerous.

Cavemen children ‘experienced strong emotional attachments with their immediate social group’ according to the study.

Researchers at York University also said there was evidence that Neanderthals cared for their sick and injured children for months and often years.

The traditional view of cavemen children is that they had a tough upbringing, but that is based largely on biological evidence.

However the archaeologists, led by Dr Penny Spikins, looked at cultural and social evidence by examining Neanderthal burials.

In research published in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology, it found that children played a particularly significant role in their society, particularly in symbolic expression.

Neanderthal groups (skull, pictured) are believed to have been small and relatively isolated, which meant a natural emotional focus on close internal relationships

The study of child burials, meanwhile, revealed that the young may have been given particular attention when they died, with generally more elaborate graves than older individuals.

Neanderthal groups are believed to have been small and relatively isolated, which meant a natural emotional focus on close internal relationships.

Dr Spikins said: ‘The traditional view sees Neanderthal childhood as unusually harsh, difficult and dangerous.

‘This accords with preconceptions about Neanderthal inferiority and an inability to protect children epitomising Neanderthal decline.

‘Our research found that a close attachment and particular attention to children is a more plausible interpretation of the archaeological evidence, explaining an unusual focus on infants and children in burial, and setting Neanderthal symbolism within a context which is likely to have included children.

‘Interpretations of high activity levels and frequent periods of scarcity form part of the basis for this perceived harsh upbringing.

‘However, such challenges in childhood may not be distinctive from the normal experience of early Palaeolithic human children, or contemporary hunter-gatherers in particularly cold environments.

‘There is a critical distinction to be made between a harsh childhood and a childhood lived in a harsh environment.’

Europeans may be closer to their Neanderthal cousins than previously thought, new research suggests.

Breeding with Neanderthals has long been known to have left its traces in the DNA of modern Europeans.

Scientists in Edinburgh have now confirmed that the genetic similarity between the two must have arisen after interbreeding in Europe and Asia, before our ancestors spread across the globe.

Previous research speculated that modern Europeans and Asians are related to Neanderthals because they originated from a similar sub-population in Africa.

Both groups evolved from a common ancestor in Africa before spreading to other parts of the world.

The two groups emerged at different times with Neanderthals leaving the African continent more than 200,000 years before humans did.

Now scientists at the University of Edinburgh and Wageningen University found the species mated in Europe and Asia thousands of years ago.

The research involved dividing up the genetic code of each sub-species to calculate the statistical likelihood of distant or recent interbreeding.

They traced the biological ties that exist between humans and the ancient species which are believed to have died out around 30,000 years ago.

The research found that the two per cent of neanderthal DNA which exists in people today came from the mating outside of Africa.
