It was the £1.6million cocaine racket hatched by a 'gang of four' Britons that has left one of them facing death by firing squad in Bali.

But on May 17 last year, when Lindsay Sandiford allegedly met two members of the syndicate at a hotel in Bangkok, she must have  appeared an ordinary middle-aged woman living a relatively mundane life.

Her world was to be totally shattered by the events of the next 48 hours. At the hotel, prosecutors say she met Rachel Dougall and Paul
Beales, both 39, to arrange for her to courier the cocaine to Bali

Unmasked: Briton Lindsay Sandiford covers her face days after customs 
officials found her carrying 5kg or cocaine and then showed the haul to
the press

Sentence: Today the grandmother was put on death row and another member of the gang she helped police catch could receive the same tomorrow

Beales, Sandiford claims, was the man who placed 5kg of cocaine in the lining of her suitcase. She was later to tell the police that the actual owner of the drugs was Dougall though both were later to deny these accusations.

Whatever the truth, the Gloucestershire grandmother was to fly to Bali two days later carrying £1.6million of cocaine.

She was intercepted at Denpasar airport, the 
main airport on the Indonesian island, where customs officials X-rayed the 
suitcase, found the drugs and arrested her.

In custody, eating a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice, Sandiford cracked as soon as she was told she would be executed if convicted.

She immediately confessed that she had been told to hand over the drugs 
to Dougall and her partner, Brighton antiques restorer Julian Ponder, 43.

The couple were known as the ‘King and 
Queen’ of Bali as they managed to afford the £1,000-a-week rent on their
palatial villa without seemingly working.

Insisting that she was just
a mule, Sandiford also claimed she was forced to be a courier because of threats against her children in Britain.

Police then set up a sting operation, and followed the grandmother as she went
about contacting Dougall, Ponder, 
and Beales.

King and queen: Couple Rachel Dougall, 39, and Julian Ponder, 43, became well known in Bali for their lavish lifestyle but they were eventually arrested and accused of forming a drugs syndicate

Fourth Man: Paul Beales, right, was also arrested on suspicion of being the 'muscle' of the group and given four years in jail last month

They sent Sandiford to a £25-a-night hotel room, where she was 
accompanied by an undercover police officer while she waited to be 
contacted by one of the others in the alleged syndicate.

Police claim Ponder turned up at the 
hotel while Beales, whom they believe was the 
gang's 'muscle', waited nearby. Both were arrested and Dougall was also taken into custody.

All three denied the charges and despite Sandiford's evidence, the 
case against Dougall and Beales was soon to crumble when officers failed
to find any concrete evidence connecting the suspects.

Police sources said that all 
conversations between Dougall and Sandiford were carried out through 
mobile phones. But officers had failed 
to retrieve a SIM card during a raid on Dougall’s Bali villa, 
meaning there was no physical evidence.

Dougall received a one-year jail sentence in the Denpasar District Court
last month for hiding the crime. She could be on her way back to the UK by April, to be 
reunited with her daughter, because she had already been in jail for 
eight months awaiting trial.

At the time of her arrest, Dougall insisted she was the victim of a 'fit-up',

Beales, a long-time Bali resident, was also spared a harsh sentence when
judges gave him four years for possession of a small amount of 
hashish.

Case: This is the villa in Bali used as the home of Rachel Dougall and Julian Ponder, Britons also arrested and accused of drug smuggling £1.6million of cocaine

The fourth Briton, Ponder, is accused of being one of the lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug to rich tourists on the island.

Ponder
said he simply thought Mrs Sandiford was bringing a present for his 
daughter’s sixth birthday.

‘Julian
Ponder believes 100 per cent that he was trapped by Lindsay,’ his 
lawyer said at the time.

Ponder reportedly said he thought the gift-wrapped 
packages, bearing the words 'Enjoy Sweet Candy' were sweets for his 
little daughter.

'I was the subject of entrapment by Lindsay, who knew my daughter was going to be six shortly after her arrival,' he said.

'Having
been caught she aided the police surveillance and brought the cocaine 
to me wrapped as if it was a present for my daughter. I never touched 
the drugs.'

Today Lindsay Sandiford burst in to tears and cried 'no, no, no' as she was sentenced to death in a Bali court.

A
verdict is expected in the trial of Ponder as early as tomorrow, where 
he could be given the same sentence, which would make him the 13th 
Briton abroad facing the death penalty.
