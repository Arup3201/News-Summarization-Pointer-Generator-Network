Our solar system has an unruly past in which giant planets nearly wiped out the asteroid belt and turned it into cosmic ‘snow globe’.

This is according to researchers in Massachusetts who claim that the solar system was once a riotous place in which Jupiter may have been as close to the sun as Mars is now.

As the planet moved through the main asteroid belt, they believe it tossed interplanetary flotsam far and wide.

In this artist's conception, Jupiter's migration through the solar system has swept asteroids out of stable orbits, sending them careening into one another. As the gas giant planets migrated, they stirred the contents of the solar system

The researchers noted that objects from as close to the sun as Mercury and as far out as Neptune all congregated in the asteroid belt at this time.

‘The asteroid belt is a melting pot of objects arriving from diverse locations and backgrounds,’ said Francesca DeMeo, a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics.

Astronomers have long recognised the asteroid belt’s diversity, but a new analysis of the asteroids within the belt has revealed that it is more diverse than previously thought.

Astronomers have theorised that long-ago asteroid impacts delivered much of the water now filling Earth's oceans, as shown in this artist's conception. If true, the stirring provided by migrating planets may have been essential to bringing those asteroids

The asteroid belt is a region of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where most of the asteroids in our solar system are found.

Traditionally,
 asteroids were viewed as the pieces of a failed planet that was 
prevented from forming by the influence of Jupiter's powerful gravity.

The asteroids in the belt come in a variety of sizes. Some are very small (less than a mile across), while others are quite large.

The largest asteroid is called Ceres. It is about one-quarter the size of our moon. It is a dwarf planet.

Most asteroids in the Asteroid Belt have an orbital period of about three to six Earth years.

The findings have interesting implications for the history of Earth.

Traditionally, asteroids were viewed as the pieces of a failed planet that was prevented from forming by the influence of Jupiter's powerful gravity.

Their compositions seemed to vary methodically from drier to wetter, due to the drop in temperature as you move away from the sun.

That traditional view changed as astronomers recognised that the current residents of the main asteroid belt weren't all there from the start.

In the early history of our solar system the giant planets ran amok, migrating inward and outward substantially.

Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Dr DeMeo and co-author Benoit Carry examined the compositions of thousands of asteroids within the main belt.

Their findings raises a number of questions. For instance, will other Earth-like exoplanet require a similar pattern of asteroids fall-out to make it habitable?

If so, then Earth-like planets may be rarer than first thought.
