This attention-seeking seal just wants to play!

A new video, with footage captured using a camera mounted on a surfboard, shows an adorable seal climbing all over the surfers and their boards in Lacanau, France. 

What started off as a normal morning on the water for Bertrand Chaussade and his friends, was quickly hijacked by the small animal, nicknamed 'You,' who was also eager to hang ten.

Attention-seeking seal named You just wants to play - with a bunch of French surfers in Lacanau

The animal climbed onto Bertrand Chaussade board, after burrowing under his hands for a pat

In just a few minutes, You had made himself at home on top of Bertrand's surfboard .

Each time he attempted to paddle out, You would pop his head out of the water again and attempt to climb on the board - or even Bertrand himself.

Although he attempts to remove the animal, eventually Bertrand relents and allows the cute little guy to sit with him.

On the rare moment that Bertrand could get the animal off the board, he was able to catch a wave or two

As soon as he sat back down, however, the attention-loving animal was quickly right back by his side

'He played with us for the whole morning,' Bertrand later wrote online 

'He played with us for the whole morning,' Bertrand later wrote online.

'He would climb on my board, ask for strokes and push me over.

'It was like playing with a little dog - it was a very playful and loving animal.

'It was a beautiful encounter and a magical moment!'  

The entire adventure was recorded by a camera mounted to the front of Bertrand's surfboard

'It was like playing with a little dog - it was a very playful and loving animal,' the man said of You
