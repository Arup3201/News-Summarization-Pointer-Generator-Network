Military security experts have successfully managed to stop a truck in its tracks by destroying its engine with a laser. 

The 30-kilowatt fibre laser called Athena burnt through the manifold in seconds, despite being fired by a team from Lockheed Martin positioned more than a mile away.

The security firm said the test signifies the next step to fitting lightweight laser weapons on military aircraft, helicopters, ships and trucks.

The laser, known as Athena, was built by Maryland-based security firm Lockheed Martin. During the test, the 30-kilowattfibre laser burnt through the truck’s engine (pictured) and disabled it from more a mile away

The demonstration was the first field testing of Lockheed’s integrated 30-kilowatt, single-mode fibre laser weapon system prototype. 

‘Fiber-optic lasers are revolutionising directed energy systems,’ said Keoki Jackson, Lockheed Martin chief technology officer.

‘We are investing in every component of the system - from the optics and beam control to the laser itself - to drive size, weight and power efficiencies.

Athena is based on the firm’s Area Defense Anti-Munitions (ADAM) laser weapon system.

In tests off the California coast in May, Adam was used to successfully disable two boats at a range of approximately one mile (1.6km). 

The high-energy laser burnt through multiple compartments of the rubber hull of the military-grade small boats in less than 30 seconds.

Lockheed Martin previously demonstrated the system’s capabilities on airborne targets in flight, including small-calibre rocket targets and an unmanned aerial system target.

The system can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 3.1 miles (5km). 

‘This test represents the next step to providing lightweight and rugged laser weapon systems for military aircraft, helicopters, ships and trucks.’

By using a technique known as spectral beam combining, the system blends multiple laser modules to create a single, powerful, high-quality beam.

This is said to provide greater ‘efficiency and lethality’ than multiple individual 10-kilowatt lasers used in other systems.

Athena is based on the firm’s Area Defense Anti-Munitions (Adam) laser weapon system.

In tests off the California coast in May, Adam was used to successfully disable two boats at a range of approximately one mile (1.6km).

Lockheed Martin said at the time that it developed the ground-based system ‘to demonstrate a practical, affordable defence against short-range threats.’

‘Our Adam system tests have shown that high-energy lasers are ready to begin addressing critical defense needs,’ added Tory Bruno, president of Strategic and Missile Defense Systems, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company.

These aren’t the first laser systems to track and destroy targets but Lockheed Martin said its tests are significant because the lasers are smaller, use less power and are more efficient.

‘The high-energy laser serves as the heart of a laser weapon system,’ said Dr. Johnson. 

‘This 30-kilowatt milestone shows our commitment to producing the high beam quality and high power needed to address a variety of military ‘speed-of-light’ defensive operations.’

The Adam laser prototype can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 3.1 miles (5km). Last year's marine tests are shown. These aren’t the first laser systems to track and destroy targets, but Lockheed Martin said its test are significant because the lasers are smaller, use less power and are more efficient
