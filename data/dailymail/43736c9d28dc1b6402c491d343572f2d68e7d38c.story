Cristiano Ronaldo has stated his intent to be remembered as one of football's greatest-ever players in history after he was crowned with the 2014 Ballon d'Or award.

The 29-year-old beat Manuel Neuer and perennial rival Lionel Messi to the gong after a stellar 12 months which saw him win the coveted prize for a second successive year.

Ronaldo has now been voted world footballer of the year three times, one short of four-time winner Messi, and the Real Madrid star stressed his determination to win more awards in the years to come.

'It's been an unforgettable year,' he said after collecting the prestigious award from Thierry Henry.

'To win this trophy, a trophy of this kind, is something unique and all I can say is I want to continue working as I have so far, trying to go on to more titles - individual and as a team - for my mother, my father who is up there looking at there any my son.

'I can see my mother, my family. I would like to thank all those who voted for me. My coach, my fellow player, the President of my club.

'I want to get better as the days go by. I want to say to all the Portuguese that I never thought I could win this trophy on three different occasions.

'Of course it is something that is always with me, I want to become one of the greatest players of all time, and this requires a lot effort so I would like to thank you for all this evening. BOOM!'

Ronaldo played an integral role for Real as they won four trophies during the previous calendar year, scoring a stunning 56 goals in 51 appearances along the way as the Spanish giants collected the Copa del Rey, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup.

His feats saw him named a clear winner among his peers for the Ballon d'Or with 37.66 per cent of total votes cast by a panel made up of captains, coaches and media members from all FIFA affiliate associations. 

Messi took second with 15.76 per cent, just ahead of Neuer on 15.72.

England manager Roy Hodgson left both Ronaldo and Messi out of his own top three, voting instead for Argentina's Javier Mascherano ahead of Germany pair Philipp Lahm and Neuer. 

Earlier, Messi responded to continuing transfer rumours by stressing he would like to end his career at Barcelona - but conceded that outcome was far from certain.

Having denounced talk of a move to the Barclays Premier League as 'lies' earlier this week, Messi added on Monday: 'I'm not sure where I'm going to be next year.

'I've always said I would like to finish my career at Barcelona... nobody knows what the future holds, much less so in the case of the football world, where so many things can change overnight.'
