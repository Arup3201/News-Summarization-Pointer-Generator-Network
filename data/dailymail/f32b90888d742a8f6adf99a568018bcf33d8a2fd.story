Royal Ascot winner Richard Pankhurst will race for Sheik Mohammed’s son Sheik Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum for the first time if he lines up in Saturday’s Solario Stakes at Sandown.

The colt carried the colours of Rachel Hood, wife of trainer John Gosden, when winning the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot in June.

News of the sale emerged when Gosden made the entry for a Group Three race he has won four times, including with his future Breeders’ Cup Classic hero Raven’ s Pass in 2007 and 12 months ago with Kingman, who has claimed the crown as Europe’s top miler with four group one wins this summer.

Confirming the change of ownership, Sheik Mohammed's bloodstock advisor John Ferguson said: ‘It has been done recently.’

There are 14 entries in the Solario Stakes - including Richard Hannon’s Tupi, runner-up in the Vintage Stakes at Glorious Goodwood as well as a Listed race at Deauville, and Hugo Palmer's Aktabantay, second in the Superlative Stakes, plus the Scott Dixon-trained horse Cock Of The North, who was third in that race at Newmarket’s July meeting.

Sir Michael Stoute's Disegno is also entered, as is Saeed bin Suroor's Future Empire, who holds a host of big-race engagements.
