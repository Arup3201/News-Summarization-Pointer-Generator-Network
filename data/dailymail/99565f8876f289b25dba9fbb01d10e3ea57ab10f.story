Robert Eunson nearly died when his spleen ballooned to the size of a bowling ball, weighing 5.5kg - 30 times its usual size

A pensioner nearly died when his spleen ballooned to 12lb (5.5kg) - more than 30 times its usual size and began crushing his vital organs.

The organ had grown to the size of a bowling ball by the time doctors removed it.

Three surgeons worked to save the life of Robert Eunson during a seven-hour operation at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria.

They said the spleen was the biggest they had removed in more than 15 years, and are preparing to write a medical paper on Mr Eunson's case.

In a healthy adult, the spleen is around 7cm to 14cm in length and usually weighs between 150g and 200g - around the size of a large apple.

Mr Eunson's wife Catherine, 73, said she watched as her husband was 'dying in front of her eyes'.

His infected spleen had begun to crush his liver, lungs, stomach and pancreas.

The spleen, which is located just under the heart, helps fight infections acting as a blood filter removing old red blood cells and storing a reservoir of blood. 

Mrs Eunson said the organ had invaded her husband's 'whole body', was warned the 72-year-old would die if it was not removed.

Mr Eunson, of Walney, Cumbria, said he is unable to thank staff at the hospital enough.

'They told me if it didn't come out I would die - but they said if I had it done I only had a 40 per cent chance of survival.

'I was in intense, constant pain down my left side.

'If it wasn't for them I wouldn't be alive now. I feel brilliant and I can't thank them enough.' 

In September, Mr Eunson's spleen became infected, filling with even more blood and causing the organ to stretch across the back of his lungs.

He was in intensive care for days and developed pneumonia before his operation. He had to undergo seven blood transfusions within a week. 

Mrs Eunson, his wife of 50 years, said: 'The spleen got bigger and bigger. It was crushing his liver, lungs, stomach and pancreas. It was pushing against his ribs.

'He couldn't do anything for himself. He was just lying in a bed. It was terrible. He was literally dying in front of my eyes.'

Mrs Eunson said she could not believe her husband was alive after the seven-hour operation.

She said: 'I just couldn't believe it. I was scared. I honestly didn't think he was going to make it.'

A team of three surgeons and as many as a dozen nurses were involved in the operation.  

Mrs Eunson added: 'The hospital showed me and my daughter an X-ray of his spleen from two years ago and one from when it was infected. 

'We just couldn't believe the size of it. It just took up his whole body.'

Mr Eunson is due to return to the hospital for a CT scan and a check-up.

Mr Sanjay Panchal, consultant in General Surgery at Furness General Hospital, carried out the operation. 

He said: 'It was a huge spleen, the largest I have ever removed and it took us about three to three-and-a -half-hours to do the procedure.

'It is not a common operation, I have done say about 30 in my career. 

'Normally the spleen weighs between 150 to 250g. Anything over 1kg is classed as a massive spleen. 

'It is unusual for the spleen to be that enlarged and in this case it weighed over 5kg.'

The world’s heaviest spleen removed weighed 6kg (14.5lbs) from a man in the US, according to official records.  

The spleen is located underneath the heart 

The spleen stores blood in the body in case of emergency.

Mr Eunson's 5.5kg organ weighed about the same as an average bowling ball. A normal spleen weighs between 150 and 200g - the same as an apple.

It is located on the left side of the upper abdomen behind the rib cage and acts as a filter for your blood, cleansing it of bacteria, viruses and other debris. 

When blood flows through your spleen, white blood cells attack and remove any foreign invaders. This keeps your blood clean and helps protect against infection.

Red blood cells have a lifespan of around 120 days, after which your spleen breaks them down. The red blood cell remains are transported elsewhere in your body where they are excreted or recycled.

Foetuses produce red and white blood cells in their spleens. Shortly before birth the spleen loses its ability to make red blood cells and bone marrow takes over.

It is possible to live without a spleen as most of its functions can be taken over by other organs. However, people without spleens are more vulnerable to infection.
