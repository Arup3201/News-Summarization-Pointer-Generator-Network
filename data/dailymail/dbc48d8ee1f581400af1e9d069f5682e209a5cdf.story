She's famous for her love of sport but the Duchess of Cornwall got a little more than she bargained for during a visit to the 4 Rifles at their Wiltshire barracks.

Camilla, who was resplendent in a bespoke dark green wool coat, was being shown around the training gym when she was invited to join some of the soldiers in their boxing ring.

Gamely, the Duchess, 67, climbed into the ring where she joked with soldiers before banging fists with one of the men.

Speedy exit: Camilla got into the boxing ring, spent a few minutes chatting, and then got out again (right)

Back to safety! Smiling slightly, the Duchess clambers back out of the ring 

She had been watching the men sparring and later met a group of boxers who had travelled to Colchester the previous night to take on fighters from the Parachute Regiment.

Unfortunately for the Duchess, who sources describe as being 'passionate' and 'caring greatly' about the 4 Rifles, only one boxer, Rifleman Jack Brown, managed to win his bout.

It was all so very different from the formalities that marked the beginning of the visit, which saw the Duchess, who is the battalion's Royal Colonel, greeted with a traditional bugle fanfare.

She then inspected the soldiers who had lined up to wait for her to arrive before being shown into the training gym.

Afterwards, the Duchess was given a tour of the battalion's formidable looking arsenal of armoured vehicles, including one of the controversial Jackal 2 cars.

Nice work: On her way out, she gave one of the boxers a friendly punch on the glove

Meeting: The Duchess also met some of the boxers who had taken on men from the Paras the previous night

Not so good: Unfortunately, only one of the boxers from 4 Rifles managed to win his bout with the Paras

Nice work: One who did was Rifleman Jack Brown (not pictured) - much to Camilla's delight

In 2009, faults in the original Jackal caused a furore, leading to it being dubbed 'a mobile coffin' when it was discovered that the weak chassis made it vulnerable to improvised explosive devices.

The new model, in which Camilla, along with Captain Louis Rountree, sat, is, according to the Ministry of Defence, considerably better protected and carries heavy and grenade machine guns.

Camilla was also shown - and hopped into - a Warrior armoured vehicle, which resembles a tank and is armed with cannons as well as machine guns.

Today's visit will be the Duchess' last to the troops' Bulford barracks, with the regiment set to be relocated to the Aldershot Barracks in Hampshire this summer.

The imminent move proved a popular topic of conversation when the Duchess was taken to meet some of the soldier's wives and girlfriends, as well as some of the children.

Formal welcome: Camilla's visit began with a bugle welcome outside the Ward Barracks

Inspection: The Duchess then inspected the men who had lined up to wait for her arrival

Formidable: The Duchess joined Captain Louis Roundtree and took a seat in an armoured Jackal 2 vehicle

Training: Captain Rountree is in charge of training and appeared to be intent on giving Camilla the basics

Arsenal: She and Captain Rountree then got inside a huge Warrior armoured vehicle

Camilla, a grandmother of six, including Prince George, looked particularly taken with some of the younger children and at one point crouched down so one of the little girls could show off her doll.

The Duchess was also on the receiving end of a bunch of flowers, which were presented by Nancy Boswell, daughter of commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Carl Boswell.

Today's visit comes in the middle of a busy period for the Duchess who is currently without husband Prince Charles, who is touring the Middle East.

Tomorrow will see her visit a school, while Friday and much of next week will also see her back on her travels within the UK.  

Kind-hearted: The Duchess crouched down so a little girl could show off her doll while meeting families

At ease: The Duchess, a grandmother of six, including Prince George, looked at ease with the babies

Hello there: She even stopped to tickle one little boy's foot - much to his mother's delight

On her way: As she left, the Duchess was handed a pretty bouquet by the CO's daughter, Nancy Bothwell
