Yes, it was him again. Mario Balotelli, given a shot at redemption by Brendan Rodgers after his shirt-swapping shame against Real Madrid, was booked for using an elbow and then missed an injury-time sitter as Liverpool’s post-Luis Suarez problems in front of goal continued.

Both managers offered encouraging words for Balotelli afterwards, citing his willingness and work-rate, but that is surely the bare minimum for a £16million striker.

He will know deep down it was another disastrous day at the office, one of a growing number since he swapped the San Siro for Anfield.

Suarez also had his share of controversial moments but at least he banged in the goals, 31 in the Premier League last season.

Balotelli is still looking for his first league goal and Liverpool are suffering as a result, particularly with Daniel Sturridge injured.

*Ratings by JOE BERNSTEIN at Anfield 

You couldn’t stop them scoring last season. This time around, they have netted only five times at Anfield in five league games and they won’t be returning to the Champions League if it continues.

Rodgers tried to show faith in the Italian who was fined for swapping shirts with Pepe when Liverpool were 3-0 down at half-time on Wednesday night.

The 24-year-old was applauded every time he closed down a Hull defender but that’s not meant to be the sum total of a world-class striker.

In the second half, he led with an elbow as he challenged Hull’s Alex Bruce, son of their manager Steve, for a header on the halfway line and caught him in the face. Naively, he then checked his own elbow for any damage.

Neil Swarbrick gave Balotelli a yellow card because he didn’t think it was intentional but other referees would not have been as lenient. Manager Bruce, to his credit, didn’t want to be part of a witch-hunt afterwards. ‘From where I was looking, they were both going for the ball,’ he said. ‘I thought Balotelli was their most effective player. He is a character, a maverick. And you have to treat him as such.’

Rodgers will have been more concerned that his supposed chief goal threat, having had an early shot saved by Hull’s third-choice goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic, fluffed his lines right at the end.

Substitute Philippe Coutinho found him six yards from goal but the striker, lacking confidence, allowed the ball to run past him without getting a touch. Any contact would have resulted in a goal. ‘It was a big chance,’ admitted Rodgers. ‘He had a couple of them in the game. With that one, it was a great run by Coutinho and I think he just opened up his foot to try and get it in, and it’s run across.

‘At the moment he is doing his best, unfortunately he is maybe missing that little bit of confidence. He kept getting into the areas, but goalscorers get their energy by seeing the ball hit the back of the net.’

Bruce picked a 3-5-2 formation and, although Ahmed Elmohamady headed off the line from Dejan Lovren and Jakupovic denied Balotelli from Raheem Sterling’s pass, Hull were the better team in the first half.

Tom Huddlestone was booked in the first half for this studs-up challenge on Liverpool's Emre Can

Can winces in pain after Huddlestone's challenge... the Hull midfielder received a yellow card, but it perhaps should have been more

                               MINS PLD    KM    MILES

Liverpool                                  109.1   67.8

Raheem Sterling           90          10.7     6.6

Steven Gerrard             90          10.6     6.6

Javier Manquillo            90          10.5      6.5 

Hull City                                   106.6     66.2

Jake Livermore              90          11.9      7.4

Tom Huddlestone          90          10.6      6.6

Robbie Brady                90            9.8      6.1

Jake Livermore had a shot saved by Simon Mignolet and then Tom Huddlestone was unlucky to see a 25-yard drive deflected wide. The energetic Mohamed Diame was their stand-out performer.

Huddlestone was also booked for a late challenge on Emre Can that set the tone for a tetchy second period.

Hatem Ben Arfa barged into Steven Gerrard and got booked. A frustrated Sterling caught Robbie Brady on the shin with a high foot.

Then, most controversially, Balotelli left Bruce poleaxed. He was looking at the ball rather than the player but it must have been painful. The pair clashed again later, leaving Swarbrick to urge Balotelli, who had four red cards in his Manchester City career, to calm down. When the Italian fell looking for a penalty after Bruce’s challenge late on, it was a desperate attempt to claim a penalty.

Rodgers sent on Rickie Lambert and Coutinho for the last half-hour and Liverpool gradually gained control and created chances. Jakupovic was kept fairly busy but as Bruce pointed out: ‘He didn’t have to make any saves I wouldn’t have expected him to.’

Jordan Henderson, another sub, incurred Diame’s wrath after going over too easily and at the death Balotelli was unable to write his own fairytale ending, appearing to lose focus as Coutinho’s cross fell to him.

His only Liverpool goal remains against Bulgaria’s Ludogorets in the Champions League.

Rodgers is playing a shrewd game with Balotelli. He will give him chances to turn things around but if it’s not happened for him by January, don’t be surprised to see Mario being asked to wave ‘arrivederci’.

For now, he’s not going to throw Balotelli to the dogs. ‘I have only been working with him for a short period of a time. From what I can gauge on the training field, I don’t think there is any danger of him losing faith. Some players might have a day when they don’t train when things aren’t going well. But he is in every day, wanting to improve, wanting to get better.

‘It is not quite happening for him in terms of the ball hitting the back of the net but he knows he needs to run and press here. The reaction from the team after Madrid was good.’

The Liverpool manager was correct in asserting that at least his players didn’t buckle again after being taught a lesson by Real Madrid in midweek. Then again, they were up against Jake Livermore and Robbie Brady on Saturday, not Cristiano Ronaldo.
