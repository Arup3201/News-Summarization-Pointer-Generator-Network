An Australian businessman has been charged with attempted fraud in New Zealand after he allegedly tried to rort $22 million from insurance company IAG by falsely claiming two submersibles.

Corey Hinds, 24, appeared in Manukau District Court - south of Auckland - on Tuesday and did not enter into a plea, The New Zealand Herald reported.

New Zealand police arrested the businessman - who heads submersibles manufacturer Hinds Systems Limited - at Auckland Airport on the same day after returning from an interview with IAG in Australia.

Corey Hinds - whose company makes the pictured submersible - allegedly tried to falsely claim $22 million for two of them from an insurance company

In May, Hinds reported two of his remote-controlled submersibles - made exclusively by his company - were stolen. Each were insured for $11 million.

But later police found them concealed at a rural property in Coromandel - west of Auckland - and charged Hinds with attempted fraud.

Stuff.co.nz reported court documents listed Hinds' address as in Caboolture - north of Brisbane - in Queensland.

The Hinds Systems Limited website said the submersibles were built in New Zealand and were designed by Shane Corsen of Corsen Manufacturing.

The submersibles are made of carbon fibre and are 'fairly undetectable' when underwater and was sought after by the United States Navy, according to the site.

'It can live in the ocean for up to three hundred days, down to one thousand metres, while it scans and photographs its environment,' it said.

The website also described Hinds as 'an exceptionally talented man with an entrepreneurial flair'.
