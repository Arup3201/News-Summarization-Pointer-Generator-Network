Golden touch: Cristiano Ronaldo presents trophy to Real Madrid president Florentino Perez

'To Florentino Pérez. With all my affection. Cristiano Ronaldo', said the inscription on the trophy's plaque. 

The Portugal captain, 28, was named world player of the year in January by national coaches, captains and journalists. 

Hot shot: Ronaldo scored 66 goals in 56 games in 2013 for club and country

Ronaldo claimed the 2013 award with a total of 1,365 points, ahead of Lionel Messi (1,205) and Franck Ribery (1,127), with the votes cast by 184 coaches, 184 national captains and 173 members of the global media 

Messi, 26, had won the award for the last four years, but Ronaldo had been viewed as the front-runner this time after scoring 66 goals in 56 games in 2013 for club and country.

They included a sensational hat-trick for Portugal against Sweden in their World Cup qualifying play-off second leg, which sealed a place in the finals in Brazil.
