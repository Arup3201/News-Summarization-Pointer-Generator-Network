Warning: Offers in the major supermarkets may not be as generous as they seem

Cash-strapped shoppers who use supermarket special offers in a  desperate attempt to trim their weekly food bill may end up paying more, research has found.

A study of 75 popular products by Which? found that leading stores routinely use multi-buy promotions and special offers to wrongly give shoppers the impression that they are saving money.

In one case, shoppers at Asda buying two packs of a popular yoghurt during a promotion paid £1 more than if they had bought them beforehand.

Under another special offer,  customers were paying 50 per cent more for a packet of rice.

With falling wages and higher bills eating into households’ disposable income, many hard-pressed families are looking to save money on their groceries.

Four in ten say they are likely to cut back on food spending in the next few months, according to Which?, while 81 per cent say they are looking out for supermarket deals to help them save money.

But the Which? research suggests such deals are not all they seem, despite eight of the leading retailers signing up to a new code to deliver honest prices.

Asda, which was the only major chain not to adopt the guidance on how to describe offers, was found to have raised the headline price for a four-carton pack of Müller Light Greek Style Yoghurt from £1.50 to £2.18 – before introducing a ‘2 for £4’ multi-buy promotion.

Asda also increased the regular price of Uncle Ben’s Express  Basmati rice from £1 to £1.58 as it went on a ‘2 for £3’ offer, a 50 per cent hike.

Misleading? Researchers found stores like Sainsbury's put up prices for seven days, then offer 'cut price' for months

Difficult: Families are trying to cut their spend on food but confusing supermarket deals make it difficult

Which? found that Sainsbury’s sold packs of Carex Antibacterial Handwash at £1.80 for just seven days before launching an offer that stated ‘Was £1.80 now 90p’, which ran for 84 days.

Similarly, Tesco sold Flash All Purpose Cleaning spray at an ‘original’ price of £2 for just 17 days, before selling at a ‘half-price’ of £1 for 47 days.

Which? is demanding an end to misleading deals, clear rules on what defines an offer and tougher enforcement.

Executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘The stores have had long enough to sort their act out. We’re saying it’s time to Make Special Offers Special.’

The supermarkets blamed the examples identified by Which? on simple mistakes while the new code was introduced, rather than a deliberate attempt to fool customers.

Asda said: ‘Sometimes mistakes can happen, but we would never deliberately mislead our customers – our aim is always to offer the  lowest prices for the longest.’
