Wayne Rooney claims Cristiano Ronaldo is now the best player in the world after his former team-mate picked up yet another award this week.

The Real Madrid striker collected a third Golden Shoe of his career on Tuesday, and opted to bask in his latest victory with a large chunk of Carlo Ancelotti’s squad at the club’s training ground.

Ronaldo – who has designs of becoming the greatest player ever – has notched a startling 23 goals in his opening 17 games this season, only failing to score in three.

And Rooney believes the 29-year-old will take home the Ballon d’Or in January and that he has surpassed Lionel Messi as the best in the world.

When asked by MUTV if he felt Ronaldo would retain the trophy, Rooney replied: 'I think so. He’s had an incredible two or three years.

‘I think he has certainly overtaken Lionel Messi now as the best player in the world. I’m sure it’ll be difficult to give it to anyone else.’

After being awarded the Golden Shoe - given to the top goalscorer in Europe - Ronaldo set his sights higher than just being the best player in the world.

The Real Madrid star says he is now aiming to be the best player ever, competing with the likes of Pele and Maradona for the title.

Ronaldo was quoted in the Spanish papers on Wednesday saying that he believes he has 'a lot of years left' at Real, and is aiming to be remembered as the greatest of all time, not just for the club, but in the world.
