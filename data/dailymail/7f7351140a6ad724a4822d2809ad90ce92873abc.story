The aliens are coming and they've found the perfect landing pad, nestled among the emerald hills of an Irish suburb.

That is, if you choose to believe footage made by one UFO spotter who filmed the glowing sky-balls hovering over Cork, in southern Ireland.

But rather than share his discovery with the world straight away, the bashful space twitcher chose to sit on it for four months before posting a video on YouTube.

Scroll down for video.

Aliens coming? The jerky video, which is without audio, appears to show a string of otherworldly glowing fireballs, drifting slowly across the dusk sky

Hiding behind the pseudonym Naktis Ireland, the alien enthusiast uploaded the grainy footage, taken on a mobile phone, last month, but claimed to have filmed it in December.

The jerky video, which is without audio, appears to show a string of otherworldly glowing fireballs, drifting slowly across the dusk sky.

Having spotted the flying objects ion the horizon, the videographer runs frantically into a garden to get a closer look.

Steadying his camera he captures one of the alleged UFOs floating in between two semi-detatched houses.

Otherworldly: Steadying his camera the videographer captures one of the alleged UFOs floating in between two houses, then two more appear

One skeptical viewer wrote online: 'No audio. This would make some sense, because if a hoaxer hasn't planned out all the "ooh" and "ahh" moments in advance, said hoaxer would then have to produce a credible soundtrack'

Moments later two more appear followed by more, all flying in formation.

But his video was met with a barrage of skepticism online, with one viewer writing on website Out There: 'No audio. This would make some sense, because if a hoaxer hasn't planned
 out all the "ooh" and "ahh" moments in advance, said hoaxer would then 
have to produce a credible soundtrack, which may or may not be within 
the scope of his technical repertoire.'

Another wrote on the same site: 'I'm going to come down hard off the fence and cry "foul".

'This event, if
 real, would surely have drawn not only media coverage, but also other 
videos from different locations (how much footage was there of the 
meteorite?).

Concerns: UFO expert Whitley Strieber said he wondered if the objects were in fact flares

Staunch defence: Naktis Ireland hit back at the skeptics, declaring, 'I never mentioned aliens. I said they are very bright, strange orbs that are UNIDENTIFIED. Believe what you want to believe, anything is possible'

Whitley Strieber, best-selling author of numerous books that have been made into feature film'It's a big city, it's not dark, they keep on coming [...] very conveniently emerging from the gap between the houses.'

Naktis Ireland reacted, writing on YouTube: 'I never mentioned aliens.

'I said they are very bright, strange orbs that are UNIDENTIFIED witch [sic] means that I cant even say that they where [sic] lanterns because no such detail was seen. Believe what you want to believe, anything is possible.'

UFO expert Whitley Strieber, best-selling author of numerous books including 'Communion,'Â  a non-fiction account of his perceived experiences with 'non-human entities', told the Huffington Post: 'I am wondering if these could have been flares.

'The thing that bothers me about them is that I am seeing that slow falling motion, not like something powered at all. I think that they are too large to be fireworks.', including 1987's New York Times No. 1 non-fiction book, "Communion," suggests the Ireland UFOs could be sky lanterns or something else.
