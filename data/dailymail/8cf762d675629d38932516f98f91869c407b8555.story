Given it’s only 18 months since Rory McIlroy declared unequivocally to this newspaper he felt ‘more British than Irish,’ there are passionate supporters of Team GB’s Olympic team who could be forgiven for feeling a bit like Caroline Wozniacki this morning.

If truth be told, this latest U-turn from the 25-year-old is a bit less shocking than that one at Wentworth last month detailing his split with fiancee Wozniacki. Everything changed for McIlroy in the aftermath of our story about his feelings of ‘Britishness’.

It caused such a commotion I sought him out the following week to make sure he had no problems with the piece. Sifting through the furore, McIlroy made it clear he was not bothered about the nutters filling the airwaves and newspaper columns with screeds of bigotry.

What did cause angst — and make him think — were the thousands of decent Irish people who were genuinely hurt that someone who had grown up playing for Ireland could now contemplate deserting them on the biggest team stage of all.

Since then, McIlroy has tried to make amends. He has committed early to the Irish Open each year. When he missed the halfway cut last year, he stayed around, signing autographs and chatting with the locals. Now comes the most spectacular act of atonement of all. It could certainly be argued that playing for Ireland represents the path of least resistance.

If he had represented Team GB in Rio, for instance, his reputation would never have recovered in the Republic.

No doubt there are plenty on one side of the divide in Northern Ireland who will be feeling sore. But most people in Britain, including me, will echo the thoughts of Team GB’s golf coach Jamie Spence in recognising the difficult position McIlroy was in, respect his decision and wish him well for Rio.

As Spence says, the worst of all worlds would have been if McIlroy had elected to sit on the sidelines.Fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell, who will also play for Ireland, put forward a persuasive explanation as to why they should wear green.

‘If you want to get religious or political about it you’re going to upset people but, to me, golf is an all-Ireland sport,’ he said. ‘I grew up wanting to wear the green blazer with a shamrock on it, so it makes sense that the best players, whether they be from north or south of the border, should want to represent Ireland in the Olympic Games.’

McIlroy certainly picked a great time to announce it, with the Irish Open about to begin and some sporting event going on in Rio you might have heard about. It must be a huge relief as well, for the longer it went on without a decision, the more the speculation would have grown.

For the Irish, of course, it’s a massive coup. Trying to predict the golfing landscape is difficult enough next month, let alone in two years, but it will be surprising if McIlroy is not favourite to claim the gold medal when the sport  re-enters the Olympic fold for the first time since 1904.

He will be, by a considerable distance, the most feted sportsman in the Irish team and will be invited to carry the flag into the stadium at the opening ceremony.

The format will be a 72-hole event featuring 60 players with qualification based on world ranking. Two players will represent each nation but up to four are allowed if they are all in the world’s top 15. Two men who might greet this turn of events with a rueful smile are Dubliners Padraig Harrington and Shane Lowry. Unless they overtake the two Macs in the world ranking or climb into the top 15, they will miss the party.

Conversely, British players such as Luke Donald, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, Jamie Donaldson and Stephen Gallacher now have a better chance of qualifying for the Olympics.

Based on the present world rankings, Team GB would have been McIlroy and Justin Rose. Now it would be Rose and Donald, with the aforementioned quartet in hot pursuit of a place.

Clearly they will not be too upset to learn McIlroy is now more Irish than British.
