Presenter and model Jameela Jamil has battled her own demons when it comes to body image and now she's calling on more to be done to help young people.

The 28-year-old Radio 1 DJ from North London joined a roundtable discussion held by Dove on whether body confidence education should be on the national curriculum.

She said: 'Body image needs to be a whole school approach so you create a high self-esteem environment.'

She added that teenagers should be aware that, 'you cannot measure your self-worth with a weighing scale.'

Campaigning: Jameela Jamil suffered with self-confidence at school and wants more to be done for young people struggling like she did 

Action needed: The panel, organised by Dove for Body Confidence Week, called on schools and the government to do more

It's a lesson she has had to learn herself the hard away after she grew up feeling inadequate and wishing to be thinner and prettier.

Previously, in her column for Company magazine, she revealed how she struggled with her self esteem and was bullied when she was a pupil at Queen's College, a private school in London's Harley Street.

She said: 'I look back at my old school journals and they're full of self-hatred, full of me condemning myself for not being prettier, richer, more popular.

'School was horrific for me, constantly an outcast for being a geek. I've been every kind of bullied – emotional, physical, racial. I've had my body battered and I've been called a ‘"fat P***’".'

Mumsnet founder Carrie Longton said: 'Instilling body confidence needs to be a two-prong attack between parent and schools'

At the discussion held as part of Body Confidence Week, leading commentators on the subject said more needed to be done in schools to prevent experiences like Jameela's.

Lucy Attley, Dove UK Brand Director said: 'I don't think anyone can deny what impact school has on children's upbringing, it's massive.' 

PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) expert Pooky Knightsmith agreed, as the panel called for body confidence education to be on the national curriculum.

She said: 'There is a really important role for education here… It is very important from a young age that we start to develop the skills, knowledge and understanding that young people need in order to embed this.'

Dr Phillippa Diedrichs a Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Appearance Research said it's an issue schools and the government should be taking more seriously.

'Talking about schools is really important… there are (also) governments that can be doing more than just talking about the issue. Body Confidence is a public health issue, it's a social issue – it is not trivial,' she said.

Worried about their appearance: Nearly half of 11-14 year old girls told Dove researchers they opt out of everyday activities such as swimming and speaking up in class because they don't like how they look

Past behind her: Jameela is now a successful model and presenter despite having low confidence at school

Mumsnet founder Carrie Longton added that 'instilling body confidence needs to be a two-prong attack between parent and schools.'

Research by Dove as part of their Be Real campaign has found nearly half (47 per cent) of 11-14 year old girls opt out of everyday activities such as swimming and speaking up in class because they don't like how they look.

Jameela said, in her experience, the problem isn't one just concerning young people.  

She said: 'My friends are all in their thirties and they're quite intelligent, talented women and I don't know any single one of them who's got a healthy relationship with food or with their own bodies. Not one, literally.'

She added: 'I work with some of the most beautiful women in the world and there's not one of them who can take a compliment.'

Dove's researchers found three quarters (73 per cent) of adults agree the UK is suffering from a body confidence epidemic, 90 per cent think issues relating to body image are not improving and seven in ten (71 per cent) agree that children in particular are under unbearable pressure about the way they look. 

'As Founding Partner of the Be Real Campaign, we believe it is unacceptable that more than half the UK population suffers from body image anxiety. It's a critical public health issue that causes depression, health and relationship problems, poor participation in school and lack of progression at work,' said Dove's Lucy Attley.
