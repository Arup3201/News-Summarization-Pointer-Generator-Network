A mother-of-two is desperately trying to raise £6,000 for medical treatment to stop her nine-year-old daughter's constant hiccups.

Trudi Veremu's daughter Eden, aged nine, from Brixton in South London, began suffering from a bout of 'super-charged hiccups' in November last year – and she has not stopped hiccuping since.

Eden is believed to be one of only 50 people in the world to suffer from diaphragm disorder Mycolonus Diaphramatic Flutter, which is also known as 'Belly Dancer's Syndrome'.

The hiccups are so strong that it makes Eden's speech vibrate and causes an involuntary punctuation in each word she speaks.

The condition means she suffers from quick-fire spasms in the lungs and throat causing sharp intakes of breath.

However, she has not yet been formally diagnosed and her worried family want to take her to see a specialist in the United States for diagnosis and treatment.

'We are 99 per cent sure she has it, but it's matter of confirming that,' her mother told MailOnline.

Now Ms Veremu, 37, is campaigning to raise £6,000 so Eden can be taken to Colorado Children’s Hospital in an attempt to beat the debilitating condition.

Her mother says she needs to be treated as quickly as possible before the illness becomes life-threatening.

If Eden is diagnosed with the illness she will be the first person in Britain to have it.

Ms Veremu said: 'It has been relentless and I am so worried for my girl.

'The attacks came out of the blue and have not stopped for months.

'When they are most severe, she is in excruciating agony and unable to talk at all.'

Ms Veremu, who runs a music management company, added: 'The pain, stress and migraines it causes knocks her out for days - only for the same to happen again.

'The NHS have been great but we do not have time on our side and given how rare this disorder is, we have to go to where it’s known best.'

Eden is due to travel to the United States in March for treatment at Colorado Children's Hospital.

Children from Eden's primary school in Kennington are among the hundreds of well-wishers who have so far raised more than £2,630 towards the  total £6,000 needed for the trip.

Mycolonus diaphragmatic flutter - or Belly Dancer's Syndrome - is very rare.

Only about 50 people in the world have been diagnosed with it.

It was first discovered by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723.

The condition sounds like a short-breathed hiccup.

These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day.

The rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the an average rate of 150.

No single treatment has proven effective, but most involve the blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve.

One notable case is Chaz Moore of Colorado Springs, Colorado - he tried several medications, but says only medical marijuana worked.
