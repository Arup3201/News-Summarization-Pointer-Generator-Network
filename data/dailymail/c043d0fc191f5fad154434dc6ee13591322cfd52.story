A cleaning mop was responsible for the flooding of a Qantas A380 cabin in July, an investigation has found.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has released its final report on the Qantas A380 flight that was flooded with 700 litres of water mid-flight.

The incident, which happened on the 2nd of July, became apparent to the flight crew shortly after taking off.

The  decision was made to turn flight QF94 back about an hour after take-off.

A leaking water valve had released almost half of the drinkable water before the cabin crew managed to switch it off.

The report said: 'The water had progressed through the upper deck floor and water was 'raining' on passengers in the vicinity of row 65 of the main deck.

'With the potable water supply switched off, there was no water available for the toilets or basins for the duration of the flight.'

The captain chose to abandon the 14 hour flight and return to Los Angeles.

The report said investigations uncovered that a cleaning mop was behind the incident. 

'Initial engineering inspection found that the coupling that joins the water pipe at the floor level where the water supply enters the galley was unlatched.

'There was evidence that the rope-style mops used by cleaners may have contributed to the coupling coming undone.'

A Qantas statement after the incident said: 'Crew on board did everything they could to help customers, including moving them to unaffected areas and providing spare blankets so they could stay dry.'

US actress Yvette Nicole Brown, who is best known for her role as Shirley Bennett on television show Community, was onboard the flight.

'Pipe burst on my #Qantas flight over the Pacific. We were diverted back to LA. River running thru the aisles #ScaryTimes #WillKeepYouPosted,' she tweeted to her 468,000 Twitter followers.

The actress later tweeted that she was safe and pleased with how Qantas handled the situation.
