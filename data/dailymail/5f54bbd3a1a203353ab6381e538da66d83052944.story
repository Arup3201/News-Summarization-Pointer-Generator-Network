PPQ's Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker have never had a shortage of stars decorating their front row but now it seems the designers have decorating them in their sights.

For this was a collection that screamed old-school Hollywood glamour, awash with starlet scarlet and frocks that practically demanded a red carpet.

Gone were the pop prints and candy colours and in their place were magical chiffon gowns for grown-ups (were you watching Kate Middleton?) as well as neat nipped in dresses that barely touched the tops of models' thighs and are a dead cert for the red carpet at next year's BRIT Awards.

Grown-up glamour: This was a collection made for the A-listers watching the frocks stream past

This was a collection made to impress the assorted celebrities lining the runway - and it deserves to succeed

But as the gowns streamed past, it became clear that Molyneaux and Parker, being Molyneaux and Parker, couldn't resist the odd quirky detail or, indeed, a touch of print.

This time around, there were Prada-esque pop art florals given a touch of London grit by being set against gothic black.

They were splashed over tiny dresses, on neatly wearable A-line skirts and all over the skirt of a fabulous gown, slashed to the thigh and given drama with flamenco-style ruffles.

There were even a few polka dots, although unlike in seasons past, these were subtle and barely registered.

But although the tropical print florals caught the eye, it was the jewel-coloured frocks in shiny silky purple, chiffon cadmium yellow and devilish crimson that were the real winners on the night.

Low key: For once, prints didn't take centre stage

Gothic: The PPQ duo plumped for a distinctly wintry palette

Frock n' roll: Separates were few and far between

Detail: Vast flamenco style ruffles gave minidresses a modern edge, as did sheer chiffon and clean lines

Star-studded: Jo Wood, Chris Pine, Gabriella Cilmi, Lilah Parsons and Ellie Goulding look on during the show

Kept modern with puffed hemlines, vast flamenco style ruffles and the odd discreet sheer panel, this was a master class in the art of dressmaking.

Separates were few and far between but this was one collection where it didn't really matter -Â  certainly not to the A-listers looking on.

Sitting watching the gowns go by was, as is usually the case with PPQ, a veritable galaxy of stars, among them singer Ellie Goulding, a puff-ball skirted Olivia Grant and Star Trek actor Chris Pine.

But stellar though the front row was, the really out-of-this-world sight on offer were the clothes themselves.

Grown-up, glamorous and very, very well executed, this was a collection teed up to impress the celebrities front row - and it deserves to succeed.

Taking her inspiration from the deadly Atropa Belladonna flower, Maybelline makeup artist Karina Constantine created a striking beauty look for PPQ this season.

She started by blending vivid purple cream eyeshadow over the eyelids of her models and then added a strong statement brow (Cara Delevingne inspired, anyone?).

Using the new BrowDrama mascara is, she gave the girls a gothic lash look and slicked a thick line of eyeliner over their lids too.

She coated lips with a dark shade of plum (Maybelline's Midnight Plum #338), before using a soft makeup brush to rub the colour into a velvety finish, a look we have spotted everywhere so far.

The beautiful shades of mauve and indigo came together for a romantic, gothic s/s14 make-up look - time to start playing with purple!
