The 'sculptor' galaxy - also known as the Silver Coin, or the Silver Dollar - is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky.

It's peppered with hot, young stars that have just ignited.

The new VST telescope - the biggest visible-light telescope in the world - in Chile has captured the most detailed view of the Sculptor yet seen.

A picture released by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) shows a wide-field view of the Sculptor - also known as the Silver Dollar - from the VLT Survey Telescope

NGC 253 is a spiral galaxy 11.5 million light years away in the constellation of Sculptor.

Radiation from the young stars in the Sculptor makes the surrounding hydrogen gas glow brightly. Astronomers have called it a 'starburst' galaxy because of the number of young stars forming in it.

The VLT Survey Telescope (VST)'s picture is probably the most detailed wide-field view of this object and its surroundings ever taken. 

It is easy to get a good look at NGC 253 through binoculars - it is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky after the Milky Way’s closest, big galactic neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy.

The many bright clumps dotting the galaxy are stellar nurseries where hot young stars have just ignited. The radiation streaming from these giant blue-white babies makes the surrounding hydrogen gas clouds glow brightly

The original picture is more than 12,000 pixels across - the superb sky conditions at ESO’s Paranal Observatory, combined with the fine telescope optics, result in sharp star images over the entire image.

VST is the largest telescope in the world designed to exclusively survey the sky in visible light, complementing ESO’s VISTA infrared survey telescope, also located at Paranal.
