A French physician who treated Michael Schumacher for nearly six months after the Formula One champion struck his head in a ski accident says he is no longer in a coma and predicted a possible recovery within three years.

Jean-Francois Payen, a doctor at the Grenoble hospital that treated Schumacher after his injury in December 2013, said he has visited the Schumacher family at home in Switzerland to track his patient's progress.

'Life after a head injury is punctuated by stages,' Payen said. He predicted a convalescence of one to three years. 'We hope, but we have to give him time.'
