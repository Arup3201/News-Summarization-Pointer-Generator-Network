Seven teenage boys were still on the run today after they 'overwhelmed' their minders at a juvenile detention center in Nashville, Tennessee on Monday.

The teens, aged between 14 and 19 co-ordinated their escape attempt by storming out of four dormitories before climbing under a chain-link fence. 

Police captured 23 of the 30 escapees  within 24 hours of Monday's escape.

Seven of these eight youngsters are still at large following Monday night's mass escape attempt 

Officers discovered some of the boys walking down the road, while others were turned in by family members. 

LaWanda Knowles, whose nephew was one of the escapees said: 'He broke loose, he was gone, but he's back now. I just want to know that he's here safely and he's OK - I don't want the police jumping on him, nobody beating on him or nothing.'

Ms Knowles said police arrived at her nephew's home, which is eight miles from the facility at 5am. He arrived at the house two hours later, where he briefly saw his parents and family. 

'He wanted to see his mom, and nieces and nephews and his sisters, so he came home. But when we found out that he ran, I jumped in my truck and put him in there and brought him back.' 

The escape happened at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center at 11pm on Monday. The youngsters left their rooms and met in a common area.

According to Rob Johnson, Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman, there were just 16 unarmed  adults on duty at the time of the escape attempt. 

He said: 'Staffing was lighter during the overnight hours, so presumably they had planned for that.'

It is understood the youngsters were able to kick out the windows from the dormitory before finding an area where there was a weak spot in the metal fence surrounding the facility.

Officials at the facility immediately alerted the Tennessee Highway Patrol who joined the manhunt.  

None of the youths who had escaped were convicted killers.  

No staff members were hurt during the escape although the teens who fled could face additional criminal charges.

At the time of the escape, there were 78 teens at the facility, most of whom had been convicted of at least three felonies. 

However, there are no warders, guard towers or barbed wire at the facility. It is more like a high school with additional security rather than an adult prison. 

Each of the youngsters is held in a single bedroom which is locked on the outside, but the door can be opened at any time by the inmate.

In May, a staff member was injured following another escape attempt when six students attempted to flee. 

The facility offers education and vocational training instead of a harsh prison regime. 

The Department of Child Services Internal Affairs has launched an investigation into the matter.

No criminal activity had been reported in the area following the escape, CBS reported.  

Johnson said the detention center was calm and back under control on Tuesday morning. 

In May this year, WSMV reported that guards who were supposed to be monitoring the troubled offenders were sleeping on the job. 

The station released photographs of workers in a booth who were taking naps instead of watching the TV monitors of the youths in their dormitories. 

Mr Johnson told MailOnline today that staff changes had been made and the center had a new superintendent following the incident. 

He was unable to immediately recall any similar escape incidents at the detention center. 

WSMV reported that along with an escape attempt a decade ago, staff were assaulted 17 times last year with two employees taken to hospital. 

The station also reported that at least 50 assaults have taken place where one juvenile assaulted another.
