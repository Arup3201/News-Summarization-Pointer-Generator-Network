'Doggers' who love being watched while having sex are turning a beauty spot into a 'sleaze park' say furious villagers.

Residents say up to 40 cars a day visit Stapleford Wood, near Lincoln, with occupants either having frantic sex sessions or gathering round to get thrills from watching.

It has been reported that many of the men who turn up for the sessions are wearing smart business suits and drive expensive cars, while the women are in designer dresses and top-of-the-range shoes.

They then pick out a partner and either rush into the woods or simply strip off and start having sex in full view, residents say.

They leave behind condoms, pornography and even underwear, to the disgust of locals.

Parents are now worried the sex free-for-all will attract perverts to the area and put their children in danger.

North Kesteven District Council recently tried to tackle the problem with a 'day of action' at the woods.

'It’s sordid. I used to take my 
granddaughter there but I wouldn’t do that now. You don’t know what you 
will find, or who you might find.'Local resident who did not wish to be named

Boulders were placed in parking and turning areas to put off the so-called 'doggers' at the Forestry Commission-owned site.

Police patrols have also increased, but locals say the issue has got so bad they now don’t bother to report incidents.

Ray Philips, county councillor for the area, said: 'Local residents now don’t want to go there. It is really getting out of hand. There is a constant stream of cars.

'I think the concern is the Forestry Commission don’t seem too concerned about it.'

The problem has grown because many dogging websites name Stapleford Wood as a popular place to meet up. The lurid activity is not just at night-time. Drivers meet up even in daylight hours, residents said.

One, who asked not to be named, said: 'We used to make complaints to the police but there is no point any more. It’s quite intimidating when there are a lot of them. They sit there staring at you.

Villagers say that as well as liaisons between men and women, the beauty spot is also attracting people wanting gay sex.

Insp Mike Jones, of Lincolnshire Police, said: 'We’re having as much success as anyone else in the country in dealing with this problem.'

Meanwhile, Nigel Lowthrop, owner of nearby social enterprise Hill Holt Wood, wants to take over management of the forest.

He said: 'It’s got worse. It’s horrendous. It puts off a lot of parents and you wouldn’t expect children to go there.'

Richard Darn, a spokesman for the 
Forestry Commission, said: 'I think it’s a case of working hard at this 
but I don’t think there is a magic bullet.

'No-one can be there 24/7 to 
patrol a woodland that size.'

The 750-acre wood was purchased from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1945.
