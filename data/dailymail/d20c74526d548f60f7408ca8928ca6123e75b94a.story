A vicious Bull Terrier which ran out of a home to attack a dog walker was killed when police were forced to use Tasers on it.

Leicestershire Police said it was necessary for its firearms officers to twice Taser the animal after it locked its jaw around the man’s knee and wouldn’t let go.

The dog-walker was taking his pet Alsatian on its evening walk on a quiet residential street in Braunstone near Leicester when the attack happened on Sunday.

The man, in his thirties, had to spend the night in hospital and his four and a half year old pet is believed to have almost died in the attack, which left it dripping in blood.

The dog that launched the attack, believed by the police to be a Bull Terrier type, reportedly escaped from a nearby home.

But police say no arrests have yet been made and the dog was not known to those in the area.

The animal, which was not wearing a collar, was reportedly Tasered once from the front by a police officer but continued to attack, and then was Tasered again by another officer from behind.

It died on the driveway in front of resident Mark Robinson’s family home, who later cared for the man and his dog while the police took care of the dead animal.

‘We heard cries for help outside on the road. I tried to stop it and went out there with another neighbour but we couldn’t get anywhere near it.

‘It was horrendous. There was blood everywhere.

‘For about five minutes the dog 
wouldn’t let go of the poor man’s knee. The police arrived really 
quickly and after about fifteen minutes it was all over.

‘The
 man and his dog came into the house after - he was white as a sheet and
 even when the ambulance came to collect him, he didn’t want to leave 
his dog who was in a really bad way.’

The
 father-of-two who lives on the road with his wife and children, added: 
‘it’ s scary because I am often out there with my son and it could have 
happened to us.

‘That dog 
shouldn’t be alive and as far as I’m concerned the police did the right 
thing. There’s nothing else they could have done to stop it.’

Mr
 Robinson said the man that was attacked is well-known in the area 
because he does a circuit around the neighbourhood with his dog every 
morning and evening after work.

‘He always says hello when he walks past,’ he said.

The man, who last night spent a second night in hospital, makes his Alsatian wear a muzzle as a precaution, and was during the attack, so was unable to defend itself.

The Alsatian, which was described by neighbours as a calm dog, was badly hurt but was last night released from a veterinary clinic.

The man’s wife is believed to be seven and a half months pregnant with their first child, and was said to be ‘terrified’ when she heard about the attack.

Police said the dog could have attacked its officers or members of the public if it had not been stopped.

The force said in a statement: ‘In the interests of public safety, firearms officers were deployed to the scene.

‘On arrival the attacking dog continued to be aggressive and attack the dog and its owner.’

Police have asked for anyone with information about the attack to contact them.

The Bull Terrier’s owner was not thought to have been with it at the time of the attack.

Police said the owner may be arrested and charged with criminal offences.

Tasers incapacitate people by administering an electric shock and are designed to be non-lethal weapons when used on humans.
