A motorcyclist has completed an incredible two year, 10,000 mile journey from Australia to London riding his beloved Vespa scooter.

Drew Milne, a software engineer, pictured himself with the motorcycle in a variety of exotic locations - from Iran to India - during the epic adventure, which began in his home town of Adelaide in March 2011.

Mr Milne, who was 31 when the journey began, has called his adventure, the 'Vescapade' and plans to publish a book about his experiences.

Beginning: An emu investigates the Vespa at a service station in Coober Pedy - Erldunda, South Australia in the early stages of Drew Milne's journey to London

On his way: During his journey through Australia Mr Milne passed by Ayres Rock (Uluru) in the Northern Territory

He captured the various places he travelled through and the 
interesting people he met along his way on his camera.

Mr Milne says the trip was a way for him to see the world in a unique way. He said the Vespa was a great way to meet people during the journey, as it drew them to him out of curiousity.

Among the highlights of his trip was a 
journey through Iran - where he pictured the Vespa in Persiopolis, and 
in front of a motorway signpost.

Another highlight was a picture with two local men when he stopped for a break in Punjab, India.

Asia: The Vespa is pictured here parked up outside a colourfully decorated business in Malaka, Malaysia as Mr Milne journeyed through South East Asia

Historic: Among the exotic locations he passed during his journey through South East Asia was Siem Reap in Cambodia

Walkies: Mr Milne pictured this man taking his elephant for a walk in Thung Wa - Penang, Thailand

Memorable: This eye catching monument south of Vientiene was worthy of picture as Mr Milne rode through Laos

Mr Drew experienced the full variety of driving conditions during the long trip to London, from searing heat to freezing weather in Italy.

Among the other countries he rode through were Turkey, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia and Laos.

He celebrated the end of the trip by standing on top of the Vespa triumphantly in front of Trafalgar Square in London.

Memories: Mr Milne, seen here during a break in the Punjab, India, plans to publish a book on his extraordinary journey

Determined: Mr Milne rode past police - ignoring their shouts to come back - to get this photograph of Amer Fort, in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India

Thanks: A Pakistani man helps Mr Milne open the crate containing the bike after it was shipped from Dubai

Mural: Mr Milne visited a wide variety of countries during his journey, including Iran. Here, the Vespa is pictured next to a mural in the city of Persepolis, Yazd

Break: Mr Milne took this picture when he stopped for a drink south of Shiraz in Iran, just before the rear wheel nuts on the Vespa became loose

Vespas were first made by the Italian firm Piaggio & Co in the 1940s.

The bikes became a cult icon during the 1960s - and were central to Mod culture in Britain and other countries.

Their popularity has grown again in many countries in recent years as part of a retro revival.

Cold: He did not realise how high this mountain pass actually went in Modena, Italy. Mr Milne experienced all kinds of driving conditions on the trip

Views: He said the Vespa, pictured here during a journey towards the Spanish coast at Lugo, Oviedo, was a great way of meeting people

France: The Vespa is pictured propped up with the Arc de Triomphe in Paris as his journey nears its end

Nearly there: Mr Milne rides past Buckingham Palace as his long journey nears its end

Epic: Mr Milne celebrates finally completed his groundbreaking road trip to London as he stands on his Vespa opposite Trafalgar Square
