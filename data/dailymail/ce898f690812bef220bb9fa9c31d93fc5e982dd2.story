A millionaire property developer who pulled down a historic  greenhouse without planning permission to make way for luxury homes has been ordered to rebuild it brick by brick.

Richard Rosebourne, 32, was granted permission to convert 19th century Heron Lodge in Worcester into four flats in November 2012, but on the strict condition that its greenhouse must be repaired and restored to its former glory.

However, after developers discovered asbestos underneath the structure, which served as an orangery during the 1800s, they dismantled it.

Destroyed: A millionaire property developer who pulled down this historic  greenhouse without planning permission to make way for luxury homes has been ordered to rebuild it brick by brick

Remains: The orangery was torn down after developers discovered asbestos underneath the structure

Mr Rosebourne, who is the development manager at Heron Homes Ltd, then submitted a retrospective planning application to demolish the greenhouse - which was rejected by Worcester City Council in September this year.

Council chiefs have now ordered Mr Rosebourne to rebuild the entire structure piece by piece and have threatened court action if it is not done to a high enough quality.

'We are in the process of ensuring an historically accurate replacement is put in its place,' said Paul O’Connor, head of planning at Worcester City Council.

'If that doesn’t happen we will prosecute.

'But this is a high-profile enforcement case for us and we are working with the developer on it.'

Scheme: Richard Rosebourne, 32, was granted permission to convert 19th century Heron Lodge (pictured) into four luxury homes in November 2012, but under the strict condition that its greenhouse must be repaired

Famous residents: The lodge was also home to the family of one of businessman William Kilbourne Kay, who founded mail-order catalogue company Kay's of Worcester

History: Heron Lodge was built as one of a group of villas to the east of Worcester city centre for Rear Admiral Herbert Brace Powell - who served in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars

Grade Two listed Heron Lodge dates back to 1823, 14 years before Queen Victoria came to the throne, and it is believed the orangery was built around the same time.

Despite not being covered by the listed status, the greenhouse was thought to be one of the last remaining buildings of its kind.

It is believed it will cost  Mr Rosebourne more than £20,000 to repair the greenhouse.

Today, Phil Douce, vice-chairman of Worcester Civic Society, criticised the developers for pulling down the building without permission.

'We are very, very worried about what’s gone on and want answers,' he said.

'The city council should be putting a stop to the work. Considerable damage has been done and it’s just not acceptable.

Praised: Mr Rosebourne's application to pull down the greenhouse retrospectively was turned down after English Heritage called the glass building a 'status symbol'

Worry: Phil Douce, vice-chairman of Worcester Civic Society, criticised the developers for pulling down the building without permission, and said he was 'very worried' by its destruction

'I would estimate the cost of rebuilding it will be at least £20,000.'

Jabba Riaz, who represents the area on Worcester City Council, added: 'Nationally, this was one of the last greenhouses of its age in the country.

'At the time it was built it was revolutionary.”

Developer Mr Rosebourne made the retrospective bid to demolish the greenhouse in July this year.

But it was rejected by Worcester City Council in September after English Heritage called the glass building a 'status symbol'.

Mr Rosebourne said the decision now threatens to make his venture a loss-making one after he poured huge sums of money into the project

The property developer has now appointed a greenhouse expert who is currently doing work for the royal family to rebuild it.

Heritage: Grade Two listed Heron Lodge dates back to 1823, 14 years before Queen Victoria came to the throne, and it is believed the orangery was built around the same time

Surviving: Despite not being covered by the house's listed status, the greenhouse was thought to be one of the last remaining buildings of its kind

Plans: Council chiefs have now ordered Mr Rosebourne to rebuild the entire structure piece by piece and have threatened court action if it is not done to a high enough quality

'The greenhouse was falling down, it was rotting and in a terrible state,' he said.

'It was taken down and put to one side, yes, but it wasn’t demolished. It was practically falling apart.

'It’s costing us a fortune but we are putting in plans for a new one.'

Mr Rosebourne said there was 'nothing special' about the greenhouse, and said rebuilding the orangery would end up leaving the project in debt.

'The council knew the greenhouse was always going to fall down and a new one was going to be put up,' he said.

'It's a Victorian off-the-shelf greenhouse. There's nothing special about it.

'We are going to have to put another greenhouse there, we are going to have get one made bespoke.

'It's a massive lump of work and a huge percentage of money that has to be ploughed into that.

'That will be the main issue that puts the project in debt.

Bill: It is believed it will cost Mr Rosebourne more than £20,000 to repair the greenhouse

'We have restored the house beautifully and they haven't congratulated us on that at all.'

Mr Rosebourne said the company had already been forced to spend extra money on the main house after discovering dry and wet rot in the wooden beams.

The new homes are due to be completed by the end of January and will cost between £300,000 and £700,000.

Heron Lodge was built as one of a group of villas to the east of Worcester city centre for Rear Admiral Herbert Brace Powell - who served in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars - and named after his ship, HMS Heron.

At the time, orangeries were the forerunners for modern conservatories and were often used by rich people to grow exotic fruits.

James Hughes, conservation advisor at the Victorian Society  said pulling down the greenhouse was an 'unlawful destruction'.

He added: 'We welcome Worcester City Council's decision to refuse retrospective planning permission for the demolition of Heron Lodge's glasshouse, which is an important element of the site's historic fabric.

Put aside: Mr Rosebourne said the building was 'taken down and put to one side', but had not been 'demolished'

'In November 2012 the council granted consent for the conversion of Heron Lodge into four homes subject to a number of conditions, one of which required the glasshouse to be completely repaired before first occupation.

'Clearly this condition was never satisfied and we urge the council to enforce the rebuilding of the glasshouse following its unlawful destruction.'

The lodge  was also home to the family of one of the most important people in Worcester, businessman William Kilbourne Kay, in the early 1900s.

The entrepreneur formed his own mail-order catalogue company called Kay's of Worcester in 1889 and their factory dominated the city skyline.

William Kilbourne Kay lived at Heron Lodge in the early 19th century and died in May 1929 after a long battle with cancer.

Kay's is now part of KandCo.com which is owned by Shop Direct Group - a multi-brand online retailer in the UK which merged with the Littlewoods home shopping business in 2005.

Anger: James Hughes, conservation advisor at the Victorian Society said pulling down the greenhouse was an 'unlawful destruction'

State: Mr Rosebourne said that the greenhouse had been rotting and was in a 'terrible state'

Exclusive: Orangeries were the forerunners for modern conservatories and were often used by rich people to grow exotic fruits not otherwise suited to the British climate
