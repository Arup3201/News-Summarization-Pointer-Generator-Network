Covered in graffiti and with every window smashed, this is the crumbling Russian village in the Czech Republic that was abandoned two decades ago at the end of the Cold War.

Eerily quiet today, it once bustled with hundreds of residents but all the workers and their families went back home to Russia after the Iron Curtain came down.

Named Bozi Dar, which is Czech for God's Gift, the village was built after Soviet forces invaded what was then Czechoslovakia in 1968.

Derelict: The abandoned town of Bozi Dar in the Czech Republic which has been empty since the end of the Cold War. There were once hundreds of residents but they went home to Russia after the Iron Curtain came down

Cold War hangover: Until the town was abandoned two decades ago, Bozi Dar in the old Czechoslovakia used to be heavily guarded because it housed a top secret Soviet military base

Thousands lived in the pale grey Communist-style apartment blocks and nearby military barracks, and the village had its own cinema, powerplant and farmland.

Before the Russians abandoned Bozi Dar and a military airfield next door in 1991, the residents were mostly isolated from the Czechs in the nearby village of Milovice, which lies across the countryside on the other side of the airfield.

The village used to be heavily guarded because it was part of a top-secret Soviet military base rumoured to house nuclear warheads, but today there are only warning signs and flimsy pieces of plastic tape to discourage visitors from entering.

Barely visible from the main road, Bozi Dar, which is about 30 miles north east of Prague, now mainly attracts graffiti artists, vandals and the occasional curious tourist.

Many buildings have become concrete shells, with broken glass, rusting oil barrels and smashed-up desks littering the floors. One or two have been torched by local tearaways.

But the village does still offer up reminders of its long-departed residents. Wooden beds can be found in a few of the flats, while pieces of old lavatory cisterns litter the floor in the hallways.

Wasteland: Named Bozi Dar, which is Czech for God's Gift, the village was built after Soviet forces invaded what was then Czechoslovakia in 1968. Just over two decades later it was abandoned

Underneath the wallpaper in most of the empty apartments, the walls are plastered with mid 1970s Russian newspapers, among them the Soviet Communist Party mouthpiece, Pravda.

Many show pictures of soldiers, tanks and military manoeuvres on the front page, the papers trying to drum up patriotic enthusiasm among the masses.

Pictures of the late former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, who ran the Soviet Union until he died in 1982, can be seen around the area.

Some floors have a floral pattern to them, a rare decorative touch in an otherwise austere communist development.

The village serves as a reminder of a chapter of history that still arouses anger among Czechs because it is tied in with their country's loss of sovereignty.

Czechoslovakia had been communist since 1948, but in the late 1960s it became more liberal. Soviet armed forces invaded and occupied the country because they were concerned about the country's drift away from the Kremlin.

Bozi Dar was built up as one of the Soviets' main military bases in the country, staffed by Russian personnel.

Artistic graffiti: This graffiti offers a rare decorative touch to the dour Soviet architecture of the Eastern village that was built in the late 1960s

Soviet newspapers: The walls of this grim apartment are he walls are plastered with mid 1970s Russian newspapers, among them the Soviet Communist Party mouthpiece, Pravda

When Mikhail Gorbachev introduced his glasnost reforms after becoming Soviet leader in 1985, democratic movements developed across Eastern Europe, led in Czechoslovakia by the playwright Vaclav Havel.

In 1989, the country's 'Velvet Revolution' saw it break free of Soviet control and in subsequent years, with Havel now president, the occupying military forces headed home.

In 1992, after the Soviet forces had left, Bozi Dar was handed back to the authorities in Czechoslovakia, which a year later split from Slovakia to become the Czech Republic.

With little industry in the quiet countryside nearby, and with the land in and around the village said to be contaminated, major developers were not interested in the area, and the village has been left to its fate.

Desolate: Wallpaper can be seen peeling off the walls of this wreck of an apartment. Behind it, the walls are lined with 1970s Soviet newspapers

Graffiti: Cut off from nearby towns inhabited by the Czechs, Bozi Dar was almost completely abandoned when the Soviets left at the end of the Cold War

Soviet past: A close-up of the old Russian newspaper, from 1974, which lines the walls of the old Soviet apartment block in Bozi Dar

Plans to use the adjacent airport as a cargo hub never got off the ground and instead, the airfield is now used by small hobby aircraft that enthusiasts fly mostly at weekends.

Workmen use the open spaces of the village as dumping grounds for tree trunks and branches cleared from the area.

Next door to Bozi Dar, and fenced off from the former Russian village, are a handful of apartment blocks. Although a few residents walk their dogs in the ghost village, many regard it as an eyesore and a hazard.

Much of the live ammunition said to have been left behind by the Russians has been disposed of by the Czech authorities.

However, the vandalized apartments, with their balcony and staircase railings removed, along with anything else remotely valuable, are potential deathtraps, particularly for unwary children.

Jiri Skopec, 32, a car industry project manager who lives in one of the blocks next to Bozi Dar, described the abandoned village as 'creepy'.

'It could be dangerous for children because they are curious. It would be better if they weren't there, these big buildings, but I don't know who's in charge of it all,' he said.

Rather than knock the buildings down, all the authorities have done as a safety measure is to drape netting over the top storey of each of the blocks of flats. So for the foreseeable future, Bozi Dar looks set to remain as a chilling reminder of Cold War tensions.

Empty apartment blocks: Hundreds of Russians lived in apartment buildings like these in Bozi Dar until the whole area was abandoned at the end of the Cold War

Grim: Only graffiti brightens up these angular off-white apartment blocks in Bozi Dar, designed in classic imposing Soviet style. They now lie completely empty - and tape warns people not to approach
