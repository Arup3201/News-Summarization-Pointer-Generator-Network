The body of a Chicago man that was exhumed three days ago for a homicide investigation involving his recently-won lottery money has been buried again Monday.

Urooj Khan, 45, had won millions of dollars in a lottery over the summer but died of cyanide poisoning shortly after the windfall.

Two of Khan’s relatives stood by his gravesite in Rosehill Cemetery as they watched him being lowered back into the ground. Authorities had called for the exhumation of his body to take samples of flesh, which could provide valuable clues into the man’s mysterious death.

Exhumed: The body of Urooj Khan is carried to a hearse for forensic autopsy by the Cook County Medical Examiners office in Chicago Friday morning

The Chicago Tribune reports that the reburial ceremony was quiet and lasted only 20 minutes or so.
Family members told the paper that they hope the autopsy will shed some light on Khan’s murder.

Medical examiners will take blood, 
tissue, bone, hair and nail samples. They'll also examine the lungs, 
liver, spleen and contents of the stomach and intestines.

Paleologos said tests on Khan's organs also may determine whether the poison was swallowed, inhaled or injected.

The autopsy was expected to be finished by Friday afternoon, though it will take two to three weeks to get test results, she said.

Khan, 46, died in July as he was about to collect $425,000 in lottery winnings. His death initially was ruled a result of natural causes. But a relative asked for further tests, which revealed he was poisoned.

Process: Cook County Medical Examiner Dr Stephen Cina speaks at a news conference in Chicago on Friday, detailing the process of Mr Khan's exhumation

Khan's wife, Shaana Ansari, and other relatives have denied any role in his death and expressed a desire to learn the truth.

However it was revealed last week that she could not eat the final meal of Kofta curry she prepared for her husband because she is vegetarian and her father - who was also in the home - did not eat it because he said he was on a diet.

Khan's brother ImTiaz told the MailOnline that his brother was the only one in the house to have eaten the traditional indian meat dish, which was made the day after he collected his check.

Urooj’s daughter Jasmeen, 17, also did not eat the food, he said at a court hearing where a judge decided the brother of the lottery winner could be exhumed.

Fighting back the tears, ImTiaz demanded justice for his brother and said that the curry he ate shortly before dying was ‘highly suspect’.

Urooj’s sister Meraj also revealed dramatic new details of the night he died and said that she was woken up by a 4am phone call with a person screaming at the other end.

The voice was so unintelligible she was unable to tell if it was a man or a woman, she said.

Khan had come to the U.S. from his home in Hyderabad, India, in 1989, setting up several dry-cleaning businesses and buying into some real-estate investments.

Questions: Urooj's sister, Meraj Khan and brother, ImTiaz - who was the one who called police after he suspected foul play after an initial investigation said Urooj died of a heart attack

Anger:
Urooj's siblings said they had compiled a 47-page dossier on everyone 
who knew him - including his wife, Shabana Ansari, right, adding it was 
'impossible' that his death was natural

Despite having foresworn gambling after a pilgrimage to Mecca in 2010, Khan bought a ticket in June.

He jumped 'two feet in the air' and shouted, 'I hit a million', he recalled at a lottery ceremony later that month.

He
said winning the lottery meant everything to him and that he planned to
use his winnings to pay off mortgages, expand his business and donate 
to St Jude's Children's Research Hospital.

He was just days from receiving his winnings when he died before dawn on July 20.

With no outward sign of trauma, authorities initially determined Khan had died of natural causes. But a concerned relative — whose identity remains a mystery — came forward with suspicions and asked authorities to take a closer look.

Further toxicology tests found a lethal amount of cyanide in his blood, leading the medical examiner in November to reclassify the death a homicide.

Khan died without a will, opening the door to a court battle. The businessman's widow and siblings fought for months over his estate, including the lottery check.

Back in the day: The last time that Maria Jones saw her daughter Jasmeen was in 2000 when she and Urooj Khan divorced

Earlier this week, his ex-wife spoke 
out publicly saying that she only learned that their teenage daughter 
was living in the U.S. after her former husband was found dead under 
suspicious circumstances.

Khan's
ex-wife Maria Jones said that she thought that Khan had taken their 
daughter Jasmeen to live in India after their acrimonious split but only
found out that Jasmeen lives in Illinois when she saw footage of Khan 
accepting his giant lottery check.

'I was thinking "Oh my God! My daughter!"' Jones said.

Though Khan's current wife Shabana Ansari is not under formal investigation by police, the dead millionaire's relatives are extremely suspicious that the victim's younger wife may have had a role in the 46-year-old's death.

Now that Khan's first wife has spoken out, another element is being added into an already-complicated family drama that resulted in an untimely death and many unanswered questions.

Jones lives one state away in Indiana, but believed her ex when he said that he was taking their daughter Jasmeen to India and keeping her there during their split.

Mrs Jones was too poor to afford a lawyer at the time so she was unable to contest custody.

Even
today her emotional scars are so deep that she has left a dramatic 
voicemail on her home answerphone: 'If this is Jasmeen, please leave 
your number and I will call you. I’ve been waiting to hear from you. I 
love you.'

One state away: Khan told Jones that he was taking their daughter to India, and she only discovered after his death that the girl had been living in Illinois this whole time

The disclosure is
another sign that the death of Mr Khan, 46, last July the day after he 
collected his winning check has exposed the divisions within his family.

Tests
showed he died from cyanide poisoning but no arrests have been made. 
His second wife Shabana Ansari, 32, has denied she has anything to do 
with his death.

Speaking to the Chicago Sun-Times, Mrs Jones, 43, said that she was 'shocked' when she saw her daughter's face on TV earlier this week.

She said: 'I don't know if she knows I'm still alive. I thought she was in India all these years'.

Mrs
Jones - formerly Maria Rabadan - met Mr Khan in Chicago where they 
worked together. They got married in 1991 but they divorced in 1997.

She
said that she later reached out to Mr Khan's relatives and was told 
that he had left the US for India with Jasmeen and did not plan to come 
back.

Mrs Jones did not want
to discuss her relationship with her ex-husband. She merely said it was
a 'really really long story' but said she was desperate to see her 
daughter.

Desperate: Jones has a plea to her daughter on her outgoing voicemail message

She said: 'I don’t know what she knows. She was so little. I don’t want to hurt her.'

When
MailOnline visited Mrs Jones at her home in Granger, Indiana, her 
husband Billy Jones answered the door and said she was in the bath.

When
our reporter called later on the phone he said: 'She has decided not to
comment at this time. She's a bit emotional, it's all a bit raw'.

'She didn't know how far she was. She said, "Oh, mommy. Come and get me. I don't want to be here,"' Jones told NBC.

'There is no telling what she is going through and I'm just so sorry that I can't be there with her.

'I love her with all my heart, and she was always, every minute, every second, in my thoughts and my prayers.'

Anger: Urooj's siblings said they had compiled a 47-page dossier on everyone who knew him - including his wife, Shabana Ansari, right, adding it was 'impossible' that his death was natural

Urooj died on July 20 last year the day after he collected the over-sized check from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven near his Chicago home where he bought the winning scratchcard.

After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum.

The initial toxicology report did not show up cyanide so the death was ruled as by natural causes. It was only when ImTiaz intervened that the poison was found by further tests.

Since then the final meal that Urooj, 46, consumed has become central to the case.

According to multiple reports, he was at home at the time with Shabana, Fareedun and Jasmeen. 

A Chicago police source told MailOnline on Thursday that Shabana did not eat the food, and nor did Jasmeen.

Not right: The brother of Urooj Khan called police demanding they re-open the investigation into the death. His call prompting the discovery he died of cyanide poisoning at the home he shared with wife
