An ancient Buddha statue has been given a new look after locals donated a gigantic golden cassock to cover its crumbling parts.

The 1,500-year-old Mengshan Buddha on Meng Mountain near Taiyuan, in Shanxi province has seen some wear and tear over the years and is in dire need of a sprucing up.

Last year, the 206ft (63 metre) tall statue was given a £6.6million facelift, however the money did not last further down than the neck.

Disrobed: The popular tourist attraction has suffered some wear and dear throughout the centuries and is in need of repair

To cover the weathered section of the statue, those who run the tourist attraction organised for a team of people to hand-craft the cloak - which is golden in colour to emulate the gowns worn by Buddhists in monasteries.

A team of around ten locals then ascended the statue and draped it in the cloak - which weighs over 400kg.

It will remain in place for the duration of the Chinese public holiday - National Day, which runs from October 1-7.

The Mengshan Buddha is said to be 
China’s oldest stone-carved Buddha statue.

But it was not discovered until 
2005, when a local farmer stumbled upon the relic.

Due to its poor condition caused by 1,500 years of exposure to the weather, in 2012 China's Ministry of Land Resources gave 10.8million Yuen (£6.6million) towards restoring the remarkable statue.

As well as being in poor condition, years of mining in the area had meant the statue was at high risk of collapse. According to state news agency 
Xinhua, Shanxi
province produced almost a quarter of China's coal last year.

Due to the environmental 
damage the mines caused, seven coal mines closed in the area in 2007 to protect the 
Mengshan Buddha.

The local regional monument protection association were able to raise enough funds to repair the head of the statue, but did not have the money to do the body

The 
regional monument protection association managed to get experts in to 
repair the statue’s head, but lacked the funds for the difficult and 
complicated repair of the body.

The
1,461-year-old Buddha statue was carved on a cliff face on Mengshan 
Mountain in the year 551, during China's Northern and Southern 
Dynasties.

It is believed 
to be China’s oldest, making it over 160 years older than world's 
largest sitting stone sculpture of the Buddha in Leshan, Sichuan 
Province.

Since its 
discovery, it has given the tourist trade in the area a big boost, so 
locals decided to provide the coat as a sign of respect and gratitude.

Dressing Buddha statues in cassocks to show respect is a practice carried out in homes across China, albeit on much smaller models.
