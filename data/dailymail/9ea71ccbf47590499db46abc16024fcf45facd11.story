Ross Barkley's World Cup journey got off to a rather embarrassing start as he nearly missed the England bus to training in Rio de Janeiro on Monday morning.

The 20-year-old found himself running late for the 9.45am meeting time, and the coach set off without him.

But they realised almost immediately and stopped for 15 minutes. Barkley managed to sprint, catch up and climb aboard, where he was met by a hearty round of applause from his squad-mates.

The England bus left the team hotel for their first training session in Rio, amid a huge military presence, when the bus suddenly stopped in the middle of a main road as it became clear that Barkley had been left behind.

Traffic was backed up for miles as they waited for the midfielder, with frustrated locals sounding their horns incessantly and onlookers surrounded England's bus to see what was happening.

But finally Barkley, red-faced and incredibly embarrassed, caught up with the bus, whilst his team-mates looked out of their windows in amusement.

The England convoy then moved on and traffic was allowed to go.

And it's not as if Barkley is a stranger to buses, having spent much of childhood travelling to Everton training on public transport.

‘Mum used to have my sister to look after, so I had to make my own way to training,’ said Barkley, in an interview last year.

‘I would get a bus to town and another one to Netherton. It would take about an hour. I used to get the 79, then the 58 or 51A.

‘It’s still fresh in my mind. You had other players my age who were getting loads of money. One player used to turn up and his mum and dad had a Bentley.

'I’d be 
waiting at the bus stop and they would ask me if I wanted a lift home 
but I’d always say no because I was too embarrassed.'

England
 arrived in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday after flying south from Miami 
following the first stint of their World Cup preparations.

And
 they will train in the city for the next few days until their scheduled
 flight to Manaus on Thursday, where they will play Italy two days 
later.
