Tour de France 2013 winner Chris Froome has become the first person to cycle from the United Kingdon to France - under the sea.

As this year's Tour riders depart the UK after three days of action, footage has been released of the Team Sky leader cycling from the Eurotunnel Terminal in Folkestone on England's south-east coast to Calais in France.

Froome rode through the 32-mile tunnel at a 
training-pace, completing the world-first ride in a time of 
approximately 55 minutes and reached speeds of up to 65 kilometres per 
hour.

Speed demon: Froome hit speeds of 65kmph during the ride, which took him approximately 55 minutes to complete

Froome said afterwards: 'Cycling under the sea was an incredible experience.

'Opportunities to become the first person in the world to achieve these kind of feats are extremely rare nowadays, especially as a pro-cyclist.

'To become the first person ever to cycle through the Eurotunnel was right up there with some of the most iconic rides I’ve ever done - this must have been one of very few ‘world first’ rides left.'

The service tunnel which Froome cycled through is one of the highest security sites in the UK and France.

Jaguar and Team Sky began discussions over six months ago with 
Eurotunnel, who are celebrating its twentieth year in 2014, to make the 
cycling challenge possible.

This ground-breaking achievement follows the recent launch of the Pinarello Dogma F8 at Jaguar Land Rover’s base in Gaydon.

John Keefe, head of public affairs at
 Eurotunnel, added: 'The Eurotunnel is an incredible, unique piece of 
engineering on par with the Golden Gate Bridge or Sydney Opera House.

'The
 problem of course, is that no one gets to see it, so we were delighted 
when Jaguar Land Rover came to us with this ground-breaking request'.
