Elle magazine has come under fire from fashion commentators this week for 'covering up' Melissa McCarthy's curves on its November cover.

The Bridesmaids actress, who is one of six stars to front the glossy title for its celebration of Women in Hollywood, is seen in a coat and dress by plus-size label Marina Rinaldi in the almost full-length photo, which cuts off mid-calf.

But for critics, the cover was received with disbelief and disappointment.

Under fire: Elle magazine has been accused of 'covering up' the curves of Bridesmaids star Melissa McCarthy on its November cover

The writers of fashion blog Go Fug Yourself were among the most vocal. They wrote: 'I kind of can't believe they put the plus-size
 actress on their cover BURIED INSIDE A GIANT COAT.'

And former model Cynthia Bailey told GMA that 'times have changed. Fashion has 
changed. . . I 
just immediately thought, "What a missed opportunity to represent all 
the curvy girls of the world.'

Slate writer June Thomas called McCarthy the magazine's 'token plus-size cover girl' and noted that the only visible flesh is a 
tiny triangle between the coat’s lapels and the briefest glimpse of 
calf.'

She mused that 'perhaps photographer Thomas Whiteside only knows how to photograph
 the usual stick insect models, because he clearly has no clue how to 
highlight McCarthy’s curves.'

'On all our shoots, stylists work 
with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no 
different: Melissa loved this look'

And Bustle argued that 'it’s
 hard to see this as a victory [for plus-size women].'

Celebrity psychotherapist Stacy Kaiser told FOX411 that the styling is 'sending the psychological message that 
hiding is what full-figured women should do. Melissa is beautiful, 
talented and popular – her beauty should be flaunted not covered. This shows that the
 fashion world is trying to strike the balance between featuring 
full-figured women, while still hiding them as well.'

Elle defended its cover stating that 
they are careful to choose looks that the subjects feel good in, and 
that McCarthy was delighted with the outcome.

In a statement issued to MailOnline, a spokesperson said: 'On all of our shoots, our stylists work 
with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no 
different: Melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover. We 
are thrilled to honor her as one of our Women in Hollywood this year.'

And indeed they have plenty of support in their positive opinion of the cover. After all, the magazine did not shy away from featuring her body entirely, as it did when it featured Gabourey Sidibe last year, or as Vogue UK did with its Adele cover.

As a plus-size brand, it is rare to see Marina Rinaldi featured on a mainstream fashion magazine cover at all. And a coat is an appropriate choice of attire for a winter issue, just as new season stock is hitting stores.

Critics have also failed to question whether it was partly Ms McCarthy's choice to be dressed in a coat. Perhaps, at 43, she is not comfortable in a clingy dress.

This question, of course, can only be answered by Ms McCarthy herself, who has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment, but the shoot won effusive praise from The Curvy Fashionista blogger Marie Denee.

'We wanted to see her fashion forward, playful, and celebratory of her shape- well HELLO! Talk about giving it her all,' she wrote. 'I cannot tell you how hyped of this cover I am! SCORE for Elle Magazine delivering to us a shoot and fashion cover that we can be QUITE proud of!'

Jezebel, too, had nothing but praise, calling Ms McCarthy 'absolutely gorgeous and glamorous' and taking issue with the critique.

What's more, plus-size stars' covers sell. British Vogue said its Adele cover in 2011 was one of its best selling that year, and according to a poll on Go Fug Yourself, Ms McCarthy's cover was the most popular of the six released by Elle for its November 2013 issue.
