A notorious gangster whose family once appeared in their own reality TV show sparked chaos when he clambered 100ft up a Ferris wheel and stayed there for six hours.

Domenyk Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester's Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prison.

Police, paramedics and firefighters had to rescue him in a £30,000 operation as more than 1,000 people gathered to watch in the city centre.

Chaos: Notorious gangster Domenyk Noonan bought Manchester city centre to a standstill for six hours after he scaled a 197ft Ferris wheel to protest his recall to prison. Authorities said the stunt cost £30,000

Thrill-ride: Noonan waved to the crowds below from the wheel and conducted an interview via his mobile phone

Audience: Crowds gathered as Noonan refused to leave. Eventually police and the wheel's operators decided to turn it, despite Noonan sitting on the axis, so they could release the people trapped aboard

Officers said his 'outrageous' actions endangered the lives of tourists - including a petrified three-year-old boy - who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in Piccadilly Gardens for two hours.

The drama, which began after Noonan was told he had breached his licence conditions, started at 3.30pm yesterday when he yelled: 'I am going to jump.'

The 49-year-old, whose family appeared in the 2012 Donal McIntyre show At Home With the Noonans, clambered onto the roof of one of the pods of the 197ft wheel before climbing ladders to its centre.

He remained on the axis through two rain showers until he was eventually cheered down by his supporters at around 9.45pm - wearing a hard hat and harness given to him by the authorities.

He was then taken off in an ambulance and arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass.

Response: Firefighters put on hard hats and harnesses as they prepared to rescue the notorious gangster

Chaos: The area, which is a few yards from the central bus and tram terminal, had to be cordoned off

Defiant: Noonan remained through two rain showers and shouted down from his perch 100ft up the wheel, but because he was so far away, most onlookers said they were unable to hear what he was saying

Ride: Noonan had clambered aboard the wheel by jumping on top of a pod before climbing along a ladder

Big statement: Officers said Noonan's 'outrageous' actions endangered the lives of tourists, including a petrified three-year-old boy, who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in central Manchester for two hours

Operators of the Big Wheel shut it down, leaving customers stranded in their pods for two hours.

Police cordoned off a large area as the stunt caused havoc for thousands of commuters at the nearby central bus and tram terminal.

They said their operation could have cost the taxpayer £30,000.

Speaking on his mobile phone from halfway up the wheel, Noonan told the Manchester Evening News: 'This is the scariest thing I have ever done in my life.

'I want the police to stop harassing me, even the probation service over the last three days. They are threatening to recall me to prison.'

Rescue: Noonan grinned as he descended the wheel in a hard hat and harness given to him by the authorities

Hanging around: Police in hard hats and harnesses waited last night as the stand-off went on for six hours

He said he had a 'stupid argument over the washing-up' with a friend at an address where he is required to stay under the terms of his licence.

Because of the argument, he said he went to stay at another friend's house which was a breach of his licence conditions.

Noonan accepted that he would be arrested and recalled to prison as a result of his protest but said: 'At least this time I have actually done something.'

A crowd of more than 1,000 people gathered to watch the protest.

Dangerous: Tourists including a three-year-old boy were trapped inside the pods for two hours

Noonan could be heard shouting to the crowd from his position but it was not clear what he was saying.

Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'I think what happened was outrageous.

'Police
 will always facilitate lawful protest but there was nothing lawful 
about this when you risk the lives of the people who were in the pods, 
including the young and elderly, and a boy of three who was extremely 
distressed.

'He risked the lives of the people who went to rescue him.

'If you want to make a protest, that's not the way to do it.'

He said 12 people had to be rescued from the pods by allowing the wheel to turn while Noonan was still perched on the axis.

He
 added: 'I took the decision that their safety was more paramount than 
his and took the decision to rotate the wheel and take them off. A 
number of them were shaken up but thankfully didn't need any medical 
assistance.'

Noonan is a notorious gangster who is part of one of Manchester's best-known crime families.

Born Dominic Noonan, he changed his 
name to Domenyk Lattlay-Fottfoy in an apparent tribute to his code of 
honour: 'Look After Those That Look After You, F*** Off Those That F*** 
Off You'.

His family first rose to 
notoriety in the Manchester gang scene after the murder of 'White Tony' 
Johnson, the leader of the Cheetham Hill Gang, who was gunned down in 
1991.

His brother Desmond 'Dessie' Noonan appeared in a 2005 documentary film by investigative reporter Donal MacIntyre in which he boasted he had 'more guns than police'.

On solid ground: Noonan was immediately arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass

Attraction: The wheel has been in Manchester for several years and was recently  moved to the main square

Notorious: Noonan is not shy of publicity, appearing in TV documentaries and changing his surname to Lattlay-Fottfoy (which allegedly means Look After Those That Look After You, F*** Off Those That F*** Off You)

Dessie was stabbed to death days before the film was due to be aired.

His funeral cortège, watched by 5,000 local mourners and made up of 40 limousines, was led by a pipe band of retired policemen and off-duty firemen.

Dominic reportedly took the helm of the family after his brother's death, and went on to feature in more documentaries and a reality TV show called At Home with the Noonans.

The family had links to Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police sparked the London riots in 2011.

Desmond's second wife Julie is the sister of Mark Duggan's mother, Pamela.

Father-of-one Domenyk, at 5ft 11in 
and weighing around 18st, has more than 40 convictions for offences 
including armed robbery, police assault, possession of firearms, prison 
escape and fraud.

He has spent 22 years in prisons across Britain after being convicted of or suspected of dozens of offences.

He
 was arrested over claims he was involved in the 2011 riots when they 
spread to Manchester, but the case against him was later dropped.

Stunt: Police said cordoning off the area and rescuing Noonan had cost local services an estimated £30,000

Life and crimes: Noonan was jailed for nine and a half years in 2005 for having a revolver under his car bonnet

His last sentence was handed down in 2005, when he was locked up for 
nine and a half years after a revolver and ammunition were found under 
the bonnet of his Jaguar when police stopped him.

It is believed he was being recalled to prison yesterday because he is still on licence for that offence.

Domenyk's nephew Damien Noonan Junior, then 25, was jailed in 2012 for plotting to flood the streets with a banned dance drug and arranging the brutal abduction and torture of a man.

He was jailed at Preston Crown Court for six years and nine months for kidnap, causing grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to supply drugs.

Domenyk's other brother Damien senior was the 
head bouncer of the former Hacienda nightclub in Manchester before he was killed 
in a motorbike accident in the Dominican Republic in 2003 aged 37.

Damien's widow Mandy famously won £1m in a EuroMillions Olympics draw in 2012, a day after her nephew Kiaran Stapleton was jailed for life for shooting dead
 Indian student Anuj Bidve at point-blank range in Salford.
