The reply from Johan Cruyff is emphatic. Would he have played like Louis van Gaal did at the World Cup? ‘No, I would not,’ he says.

There is no room for doubt. It is clear that one of the world’s finest ever footballers is less than impressed with Manchester United’s current manager.

It might have passed some by in England, but while Van Gaal’s Holland team marched on to the World Cup semi-finals in Brazil last summer, with their coach lauded in this country as a tactical genius, back home in Holland his old rival Cruyff was criticising the directness of the play, the lack of passing and the absence of the Dutch signature on their game.

‘The result is perfect,’ Cruyff does concede, for no-one had Holland down as semi-finalists prior to the tournament. ‘That’s what they needed to do. But you can talk about other things, the quality that the team had. A lot of times it’s a question of survival. I didn’t see the football that I would like.’

Cruyff would have stuck to his own brand of Total Football, passing the ball, dominating the game through possession, come what may. When it is put to him that playing that way with the current Dutch team might have resulted in an earlier exit, he shrugs. ‘Everybody is like he is,’ says Cruyff.

It is a curious dynamic in Dutch football, these two giant figures bestriding the stage with their respective factions. In Holland, you are either with Van Gaal or Cruyff. Cruyff was the great player — for most people, among the best ever, alongside Pele, Maradona, Messi and Di Stefano.

Even now you can feel the reverence in which Cruyff is held. Last week he was at St Andrews playing at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championships, the European Tour event which uniquely pairs up celebrities with professional golfers. In the course-side hotel in which he is staying, man of the moment Rory McIlroy has just breezed through. Cruyff, though his own finest moments were mainly 40 years ago, is afforded similar deference by fans and staff.

Van Gaal, by contrast, is the grafter. No more than average as a player, he forged a managerial career from the grass roots up to the European Cup, La Liga and Bundesliga titles while Cruyff, the superstar, was parachuted into the top jobs. 

Cruyff, unlike most greats, was a success as a manager, winning Barcelona’s first ever European Cup in 1992. But since he left that job he has barely coached and yet remains probably the most influential figure in world football. His tactics, and those of his mentor, Rinus Michels, of incessant passing and pressing, constant attacking and an almost obsessive desire to create, have transformed the game.

Pep Guardiola is his best-known disciple and his Barcelona team of 2008-2012 were the best exponents of the craft. Closer to home, Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez are also clear followers.

In fact, Cruyff would feel more at home with the playing style of Manchester United’s Sunday opponents, Everton, than the tactics of his compatriot. ‘Everton try to dominate the ball. If you have the ball, you decide what is going to happen.’

Everton and Liverpool, it seems, come closest to executing the principles he forged. ‘I think so,’ he says.

The intensity of the Van Gaal- Cruyff split does seem curious. All Dutch teams, including Van Gaal’s, pass the ball exceptionally well. Both coaches have a penchant for the back three and for attacking football. They grew up in neighbouring Amsterdam suburbs and played at Ajax where Van Gaal, who played in Cruyff’s position, left because he couldn’t establish himself in the first team. Van Gaal then followed Cruyff as coach at Barcelona in the 90s, providing the link to Guardiola.

If there was a decisive battle that symbolises the struggle between the two dominant figures in Dutch football it came in 2011, when Van Gaal was made managing director at Ajax, a move which Cruyff, despite being a board member, was not consulted over. Cruyff went to court to ensure Van Gaal never took up his post, arguing that the board needed to consult all directors before making the appointment.

The differences are minuscule but fiercely debated within the faith. And if it is a civil war, then Cruyff is the cavalier and Van Gaal the roundhead. For Cruyff’s taste, Van Gaal’s teams are too manufactured.

‘The difference is that he always organises a lot of things for people,’ says Cruyff. ‘And I always use the basic quality of people to achieve what I want to achieve. That’s a different way of thinking. I always love that they do things. And when it goes wrong, well, try to correct it in one way or another. His way is more as a very good organiser.’

At times, their personalities seem to infect all football debates, even when Cruyff is no longer a direct participant. So when Van Gaal’s Holland beat Spain 5-1 at the World Cup — the then holders with a side full of Barcelona players schooled the Cruyff way —some pronounced it the death of tiki-taka football.

‘That sounds absurd,’ says Cruyff. ‘First of all, the teams that play that way, like Barcelona or Bayern Munich now, they are attacking teams. The control of the ball is very important. You have got a rest and the opponents have to run.

While Van Gaal was an average player, Cruyff was considered one of the world's best of all time

‘The moment they make a little mistake, you’re in. That’s a way of playing I think that will never change because a good team with quality players will always do that.

‘You see the way Ajax played in 1974, so many years ago.’

‘We didn’t need a type like this,’ explains Cruyff of his objections. ‘We needed other types of people. In golf you have one player and a coach for putting, a coach for approaching, a coach for driving.

‘In football you have one coach for 20 people. It’s absurd, because they are all individuals in different positions, with all kinds of different qualities, which you have to know.

‘You have to control the ball, you have to shoot with your left, with your right, control with the left, you have to run, you have to head, you have to dribble, a lot of things. Maybe I’m a very good coach for the offensive part and I’ll never be a very good coach for the defensive.’

SO Van Gaal (below) is more autocratic whereas he likes to delegate? ‘I always delegate. If someone is very good at something, whatever it is, he will be in charge.’

Cruyff insists he has no personal issue with Van Gaal, though they do not appear to have spoken since that dispute. ‘The last few years we didn’t meet because I lived in Spain and he was in Holland. It’s not a question that we don’t want to see him, because people always create a lot of things that are not there. I never have a problem with nobody.’

It is the Dutch way, of course, to have your conflict out in the open. There is another protégé of Cruyff’s currently doing rather better in the Premier League than Van Gaal.

Ronald Koeman was at the centre of Cruyff’s back three when he managed Ajax and then Barcelona. Koeman scored the goal that won the European Cup in 1992. His success at Southampton doesn’t surprise Cruyff.

‘He was always a key figure. At that time everyone was playing two up front and we were playing three at the back. It means organisation was required at the the back and that’s what he did. He’s a strong personality as well. He’s got the vision.’

But both being Dutch and ‘strong personalities’, they would get into discussions over tactics. Koeman the player was seemingly happy to query and question Cruyff the manager. Some might even call it arguing. ‘Of course,’ says Cruyff, quite happy at the suggestion. ‘Arguing is part of the game. That’s how you learn.

‘It’s not that I am right or he is. It’s that I see something and I say it but the other one must be capable of doing it. They have to solve the problem. So maybe when the manager says one thing, you could say: “But what if this happened?”. It’s just a discussion about football, which is beautiful.’

Or, as we would call it, ‘a dressing-room bust up’. The Dutch have always done football differently.
