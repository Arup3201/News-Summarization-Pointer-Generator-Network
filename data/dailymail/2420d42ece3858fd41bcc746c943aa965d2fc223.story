Kelly Osbourne didn't always want to grow up to be like her famous mom - but in a letter published in the new book A Letter to My Mom, the TV personality admitted that she is now proud to be Sharon Osbourne's daughter. 

For author Lisa Erspamer's third collection of tributes, celebrities such as Melissa Rivers, Shania Twain, will.i.am, Christy Turlington Burns, and Kristin Chenoweth all composed messages of love and gratitude to the women who raised them. And the heartwarming epistolary book, which was published last week, has arrived just in time for Mother's Day on May 10.  

'Like all teenage girls I had this ridiculous fear of growing up and becoming just like you,' Kelly Osbourne wrote in her letter, republished on Yahoo Parenting. 'I was so ignorant and adamant about creating my "own" identity.'

Mini-me: In Lisa Erspamer's new book A Letter to My Mom, Kelly Osbourne (R) wrote a letter to her mother Sharon (L) saying that she's happy to have grown up to be just like her

She went on to say that one day she realized she was already just like Sharon, and she shouldn't have been surprised by the fact.

'Why had I been fighting the inevitable for so long?' she continued. 'You are the most beautiful, kind, generous, loving, and - let’s not forget - strongest person I have ever met and the best part is that you are MY mum. I am so proud to be your daughter.'

Kelly's former co-star on E!'s Fashion Police, Joan Rivers, was also paid tribute to by her daughter Melissa Rivers; Melissa said she read the letter to her mom before Joan's death last year.

Meanwhile, Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, penned a letter to her mother, Susan Barrantes, who left Sarah at age 13 to be raised by her father when she moved to Argentina with another man.

'I am writing to you now, to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for the life lessons you have given me,' she wrote. 'You gave me the strength to look at life differently.'

Another contributor, Dr. Phil McGraw, gratefully explained that because his mother Geraldine McGraw knew he would succeed, Dr. Phil 'began to believe it too.' 

The book has been filled with loving letters from non-celebrities as well; one woman, Suzy Unger, called her mother her hero, while another, Tejal Patel, thanked her mother for teaching her about parenting.
