A 62-year-old Florida man's February 16 death is being blamed on a brown recluse spider bite, a fatality so rare that statistics aren't even kept for them.

Ronald Reese was bitten in the neck by the spider, which are usually about the size of a U.S. quarter, all the way back in August while clearing out an old house.

What followed were six agonizing months of related illnesses as the Lakeland man clung to life with an abscess eating away toward his spine until he finally let go last week.

Tragic: Ronald Reese was a generous and kind man according to family but his left ended at age 62, six months after a brown recluse spider bite sent his health spiraling all because of complications from an abscess the bite caused on his neck

'I thank the lord for it': Reese's 88-year-old father William says he was happy his son finally died after six months of painful misery

Reese managed to make it home that day in August after he was bitten, but by the following day his father told TheLedger.com that his son could barely get out of bed.

Days after that, a paralyzed Reese collapsed.

The Polk County Medical Examiner deemed his death the result of complications from a spider bite, but between his collapse and his eventual death, Reese suffered terribly.

Reese's 88-year-old father William 
Reese said his son went through numerous procedures and was in and out 
of the hospital, but nothing seemed to work.

'They tried to alleviate his pain, but for six months they didn't,' Reese said. 'We would beg the nurses to give him something.'

Finally after months of suffering, Reese's pain stopped.

'I was glad when he died. I said, "Thank you, Lord, for getting him out of his misery?"' said Reese.

Rare: A Florida man bitten by a brown recluse and died six agonizing months later from complications from the bite, making him an extremely rare example of a spider bite fatality

Abscess: A brown recluse bite can cause an abscess such as this. Sometimes these wounds become extremely large and can become seriously infected, as was likely the case with Reese (FILE)

A brown recluse bite may start as a blister that eventually becomes an abscess after necrosis sets in.

Other symptoms may include:

Brown recluse spiders are typically found in cool, dark, damp places.

The midwest and southern states more commonly see large numbers of the arachnid, but they are present in parts of Florida.

The United States sees no more than 1 or 2 spider bite deaths a year, if that.

However, most such fatalities are caused by the brown recluse.

Ronald Reese's death is startling not just for all its needless suffering but also for its astounding rarity.'

The
 medical examiner said Reese was never tested to determine what type of 
spider bit him, but medical records show there were definite 
complications from a spider bite wound on his neck.

Few
 statistics on deaths attributed to spider bites are available. 
According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, only 
two people died from spider bites between 2001 and 2005. Both were 
believed to be caused by brown recluse spiders.

The
 brown recluse spider, which is not native to Florida, is one of just a 
handful of spiders that are dangerous to humans, though all spiders 
carry venom as a way to kill and digest their prey, said Polk State 
College biology professor Logan Randolph.

According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, a bite from a brown recluse spider starts with 
two small puncture wounds and develops into a blister. The venom can 
also cause a severe lesion by destroying skin tissue, which requires medical attention.

However, the bites typically aren't lethal, Randolph said.

‘In
 most spider bites, complications arise mostly if there's some secondary
 factor. If the person has a specific allergic reaction, if their health
 was compromised in some other manner, or if the bite causes an open 
wound with a secondary infection,’ Randolph said.

Spiders typically avoid humans, he said.

‘Most
 spiders aren't going to attack you,’ Randolph said. ‘It's when you trap
 them, or you're moving something out of a cabinet and your hand brushes
 them — it's typically a defense. They react rather than attack.’

Scary: The brown recluse is not native to Florida but it's commonly found in the Sunshine State nonetheless. The yellow area indicates the potentially dangerous arachnid's normal stomping grounds. In parts of the South and Midwest, the brown recluse can be found in large groups inside homes
