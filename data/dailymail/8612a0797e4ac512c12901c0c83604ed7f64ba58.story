A man who was dramatically rescued in last September’s epic Colorado floods has filed papers indicating his intention to sue his rescuers.

Roy Ortiz from Broomfield was trapped in his submerged vehicle for two hours after heavy rains washed his car off the road and into a creek on the morning of September 12.

Six months on, Oritz has reluctantly filed a notice of intent to sue his rescuers and other authorities because he says he needs help paying his medical bills.

He claims they took too long to rescue him, despite pleas for help from his family.

No lawsuit has yet been filed, but the document filed by Ortiz's lawyer is typically a precursor to filing a lawsuit against a government agency

No lawsuit has yet been filed, but Ortiz's lawyer, Aurora attorney Ed Ferszt, has filed the legal document that is typically a precursor to filing a lawsuit against a government agency.

In the document, Ferszt states that Ortiz survived ‘by pure grace.’

He claims that crews took too long to respond to Ortiz and that the road should have been closed or at least marked during the rains.

Ortiz’s wife and brother were both saved before him and the document claims officials ignored their pleas for help for him.

Instead, he was forced to jump into the back seat of his 2003 Pontiac where there was an air bubble in which he spent two hours desperately trying to keep himself alive.

‘It’s unfortunate to have to try and cast liability and responsibility for this act of God on the men and women who risked their own lives,’ Ferszt told CBS4.

Ortiz suffered physical trauma, including hypothermia and muscle spasms, as well as property damage and emotional distress, the document states. 

His medical bills for the accident totaled $40,000, while he any claim filed would seek about $500,000 in total damages.

A spokesperson for North Metro Fire Department, who are named in the documents, said they were  happy that they were able to rescue Ortiz.

Sara Farris told CBS4 that they ‘certainly sympathize with what Mr. Ortiz had to go through.’

'I’m sure it was a traumatic experience for him,' she said. 'Ultimately, we were just very grateful we were able to save his life that day.'
