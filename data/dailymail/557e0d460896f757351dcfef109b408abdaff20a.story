Shamed: Rolf Harris was jailed for 12 indecent assaults against four girls between 1968 and 1986

Shamed former children's entertainer Rolf Harris has received tax and VAT rebates amounting to almost £200,000.

The paedophile, 84, placed two of his companies - Rolf Harris Enterprises and Rhel Holdings into liquidation - and accounts reveal he and his wife were left with a windfall of £1.2 million.

This included a £148,000 tax refund, plus they were entitled to an additional £48,000 in the form of a VAT refund, it has been reported.

The total figure is £196,000 and it's believed Harris will give the majority of his fortune to his wife Alwen and his daughter Bindi, according to The Sun. 

Harris was jailed in July last year for 12 indecent assaults against four girls between 1968 and 1986.

Last month it was revealed Harris could be earning as much as £1,300 a day from his prison cell thanks to his shrewd investments.

‘He is a convicted paedophile and yet he is ­making a large sum of money,’ a source close to his finances told the Sunday People. 

Harris invested much of his multi-million pound earnings from his long-running career as a TV star, musician and artist. 

At the time of his sentencing, his companies were worth £8.5 million, the Sunday People reported.

New figures suggest his earnings have shot by £290,000, according to the newspaper. 

Harris also owns a home on the River Thames and his total assets could be worth more than £15 million.

His oldest company, Rolf Harris Enterprises, was launched in 1963 and Rhel Holdings was set up in January 2012. 

Earlier this week, Harris was stripped of the CBE that was awarded to him by the Queen.

The move came eight months after he was jailed for nearly six years for the attacks.

The former children's star had his honour annulled at the order of the Queen, days after being stripped of his Australian honours.

Officials at the Cabinet Office had been accused of dragging their feet over the issue, but sources insisted they had to follow established procedures before removing the gong.

Harris was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later, and a CBE in 2006. 

Harris was the second person to be convicted under a wide-ranging police investigation set up in the wake of revelations that the late Jimmy Savile, a fellow BBC star, was a prolific abuser.
