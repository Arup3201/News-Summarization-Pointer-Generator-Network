A man suffered third degree burns when he stepped in to help his girlfriend cook dinner - and opened a pressure cooker which exploded in his face.

Clark Bailey, 28, from Mere, Wiltshire, thought he would be doing his partner, Vicky Snook, 30, a favour by checking on her chicken casserole.

But the father-of-three didn't realise she had borrowed the appliance from a friend to cook the dish - and when he tried to force the lid off, it blew up.

The father-of-three didn't realise his partner had borrowed a pressure cooker. He is seen above recovering at Southampton General Hospital. He even saw the funny side... and later ate what was left of the meal

The pan lid hit him in the forehead, spraying boiling hot water all over his face, arms and hands.

Mr Bailey, a call centre worker, wrapped wet towels round his head to soothe the burning before he was taken to hospital by ambulance.

Luckily, his blistered skin healed well and doctors say his scars will eventually fade away completely.

Mr Bailey yesterday admitted the potentially deadly accident was his 'own silly fault'.

He said: 'I was trying to be helpful with the cooking - but really I was interfering.

'I didn't realise that Vicky was using a pressure cooker. I checked how the casserole was cooking and put the lid on it.

'When I went back to check it 20 minutes later, I struggled to pull the lid off.

'I gave it a really good tug and the lid flew off and hit me on the head.

'I don't really remember the pain of the burns as I was in so much shock. I was so worried that I had ruined dinner. Apparently that is all I kept saying.

'Vicky wrapped my head in wet towels and I ran my hands under a tap until the paramedics arrived.

'I didn't scream. I was laughing and joking in the ambulance as I could appreciate the funny side.

'I had food in my hair for two weeks as I was not allowed to get my dressings wet so I couldn't have a shower.

'I regret not leaving Vicky to it with the cooking. It was my own silly fault. But it could have been a lot worse.

'Luckily I had my glasses on - otherwise I could have lost my sight.'

The incident happened at shop assistant Ms Snook's home in Southampton, and Mr Bailey spent more than two hours in Southampton General Hospital having his burns treated.

Mr Bailey, who says he will never buy his own pressure cooker, added: 'We ate what was left of the casserole when we got back from the hospital - it was very nice.'

In 2011, an elderly woman almost bled to death after her pressure cooker exploded and brutally severed her leg in Miami.

Pressure cookers have been misused by terrorists for make-shift bombs including for the attack on the Boston marathon last month.
