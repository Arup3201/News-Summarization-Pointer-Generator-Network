Five members of a violent smash and grab gang who wore burkas during a daring £1.5million heist at Selfridges were today jailed for a total of 58 years.

The gang, who had carried out a similar raid at a jewellers’ in Windsor weeks earlier, threatened terrified staff and customers while smashing display cabinets and snatching expensive designer watches.

Armed with axes and sledgehammers, the gang stormed the busy 
store in broad daylight on June 6 last year - destroying cabinets and displays as they stole dozens of items.

Relatives of the gang broke down in tears as Judge Nicholas Jones handed down sentences ranging from eight to 15 years in jail at Kingston Crown Court for their involvement in one or both of the Selfridges and Windsor raids.

As the lengthy prison terms were read out, some of the defendants patted each other on the back in moral support, while some sat with their head in their hands in the dock.

Gang member Connor Groake, who was sentenced for the Selfridges robbery at an earlier date, and fellow robber Sam Curtin were detained by members of the public after crashing their moped as they attempted a high-speed getaway.

A total of 
142 designer watches were taken, although 41 were recovered from Curtin 
and Groake, and investigators totalled the combined value of the goods 
at £1,496,000.

Police
 estimated the damage caused to the shop during the raid combined with 
the value of the goods totalled more than £2.2million.

Weeks before the high-profile Selfridges attack, the same gang targeted a jewellers in Windsor.

As Curtin and Croake fled the scene on a scooter, a waiter heroically tackled one on them and restrained him until police arrived.

Mohamed Hussein, a law student who was working at the time in a pizza restaurant, pinned one of them down until police arrived.

At the time, the 29-year-old bodybuilder told the Evening Standard: 'I feel confident anyone would do this. I am no hero.

'Some other guys helped me hold him, while we waited for the police. I wasn’t worried. I used to do boxing.'

Dressed in burkas, they stormed inside 
the Robert Gatwood store armed with sledgehammers and axes and raided 
display cases containing a number of Rolex watches. Nineteen were taken 
in total with a combined value exceeding £175,000. Police estimated the 
damage caused to the store at more than £41,000.

Detectives later proved the group had carried out a reconnaissance run to the jewellers in the weeks previously and had aborted an attempt at the raid the day before it was targeted.

Sentencing the gang today, Judge Jones described the Selfridges raid as 'a professionally planned and carefully executed robbery'.

He said: 'The target of that robbery was Selfridges. The vehicles were stolen in advance and you entered the store half an hour before it closed on June 6 last year. You walked in with your faces disguised by burkas and smashed the jewellery cases with axes.

'At the time Selfridges was busy with shoppers. Members of staff and the public were understandably terrified. One asked a taxi driver to take her "anywhere" to get away. The watches stolen had a value of almost £1.5million and, as is inevitable with such wanton destruction, there was damage caused to the store. One hundred of the watches remain unaccounted for.

'Sledgehammers, axes and burkas were also used in the Windsor robbery. The door was smashed, four men entered in burkas and stole Rolex watches. Damage was caused as well. An axe was held over the head by one robber, no doubt to stop any bystanders intervening as they made their escape. These were professionally organised robberies.'
