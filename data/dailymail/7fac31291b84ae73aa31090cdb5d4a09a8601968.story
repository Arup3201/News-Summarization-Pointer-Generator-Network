Ram raiders stole all of the Red Bull Formula One team's trophies in a twilight raid on their Milton Keynes factory, but many of them are thought to be worthless replicas.

Six men used a 4x4 and a Mercedes to drive through the building's main entrance, stealing more than 60 trophies, but a source close to the team revealed that many of them were made of plastic and of no value.

This means that the thieves, who will not be able to sell the trophies, will also be unable to melt them down to flog off as scrap metal.

One of the trophies that may have been stolen, a second place trophy Mark Webber won at the Brazilian Grand Prix, was made of recycled plastic.

Red Bull won the Constructors'  Championships from 2010 to 2013, while Sebastian Vettel won the drivers' championship for each of the four years.

However the ram raiders, who used vehicles with foreign number plates, failed to get away with these prestigious trophies too as they had been passed on to this season's title winners Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton. 

Despite many of the trophies being of little material value, team principal Christian Horner said staff were 'absolutely devastated' by the break-in on Friday night, which had taken 'years of hard work to accumulate'.

He said: 'The break-in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time.

'The offenders took items that not only did not belong to them, but which represented the efforts of a group of dedicated, hard-working individuals.

'Beyond the aggressive nature of this break-in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies. The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one.

'But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas.'

Vettel and former team mate Mark Webber won a combined 43 races while they were at Red Bull from 2010-2013, with Daniel Ricciardo adding three more wins to the team's total this season

The team won 43 races over the four-year period, receiving a trophy for each victory, as well as four constructors' trophies.

Former Red Bull drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber also won separate trophies for finishing on the podium, as well as Vettel's four championships, but it not known whether they were kept in the Milton Keynes factory or if replicas were kept instead.

Daniel Ricciardo also won three races for Red Bull this season.  

Horner added: 'The actions of these men mean it's likely that we will have to make our site less accessible in the future, which will be unfair on the hundreds of fans that travel to visit our factory each year to see our trophies and our Formula One car.

'We would like to appeal to anyone who knows any information on the whereabouts of these trophies or the offenders involved to contact Thames Valley Police.'

Police said they were called at 1.30am this morning following the robbery and that staff were not harmed.

A Thames Valley police spokesman said: 'Two cars were involved. A silver 4x4 which was used to drive through the entrance and a further dark coloured, black or dark blue Mercedes estate car. Both are believed to have foreign number plates.

'There is no description of the offenders available at this time, although they are all believed to be men, wearing dark clothing.'

Red Bull entered Formula One in 2005 after owner Dietrich Mateschitz bought the now-defunct Jaguar F1 team.

They won their first World Championship points in the team's first race as British driver David Coulthard took fourth place at the Australian Grand Prix. 

Coulthard won Red Bull's first podium in the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix, the same year that their sister team Toro Rosso entered the sport.

Surprisingly, Toro Rosso, the junior team, won a race before Red Bull, with 21-year-old Sebastian Vettel becoming the youngest driver to take a victory after storming to the chequered flag in Monza, Italy.

After Vettel's move to Red Bull, the team rose through the ranks, eventually taking the constructors' title in 2010 after they benefited from a change in regulations.

Vettel and team mate Mark Webber continued to dominate the sport, with the German winning the next three titles.

The pair's relationship became strained as Red Bull appeared to back the four-time champion over Webber, with the Australian quitting the sport at the end of 2013 to take up endurance racing with Porsche.

Vettel was joined at the team by Daniel Ricciardo, previously of Toro Rosso, who won three races and looked the better driver throughout the 2014 season - which was dominated by Mercedes.

Russian driver Daniil Kvyat, who drove for Toro Rosso this season, will replace Vettel for the 2015 season when the German joins Ferrari.
