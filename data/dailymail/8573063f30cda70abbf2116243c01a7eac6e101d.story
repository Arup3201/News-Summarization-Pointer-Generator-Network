An Alabama pastor who is a suspect in his wife's murder was arrested at an airport on Wednesday night as he tried to leave the country.

Police believe the Rev Richard Shahan was attempting to flee to Russia when they stopped him at a Tennessee airport as he tried to board a flight to Germany.

The 53-year-old was subject to an arrest warrant after his wife, Karen Louise, was found stabbed to death in the couple's home.

Stopped: Pastor Richard Shahan was arrested in an airport as police investigate the murder of his wife, Karen

Shahan had already checked in his luggage when he was stopped. His arrest warrant had included a 'customs lookout' in case he tried to leave the country, according to Daily News.

He had been booked on to a flight to Frankfurt, but police claimed he had intended to then travel on to Russia.

The pastor had been planning a three-year mission, based mainly in Kazakhstan, according to his church.

Because the investigation into his wife's murder is still open, police had told him to remain in the country.

When his wife's body was discovered in their Homewood home on July 23, Shahan was questioned and kept in police cells for 48 hours.

He claimed he had been visiting one of the couple's two sons in Kentucky at the time of the murder, and was released without charge.

Homewood Police Chief Jim Roberson said 'certain inconsistencies' in the pastor's interviews had led to officers to consider him as their main suspect. 

He claimed investigators had established a motive, but said: 'There are very few new details of which we can go into great elaboration because it is an ongoing investigation.'

Attorney John Lentine, who is representing Shahan, told Al.com the statements that his client was attempting to flee the country were misleading.

'Some of the inferences that were put out there in the news conference made it sound like Richard was trying to leave the country and never come back,' Mr Lentine said.

'Anybody who's been keeping up with this knows that Richard had announced months ago that he was planning on going on another mission trip like he did in 2012.'

He added: 'The chief is saying "We've got our man", then saying it's an ongoing investigation. There's your inconsistency. The reality is they've always looked at Richard, and they didn't bother to look any further out than that.'

Mrs Shahan, who sang for years in the church choir, was found dead after failing to show up for work. Officers at the time said the couple's home had been in disarray.

After his wife's death Shahan was 
put on paid administrative leave from the First Baptist Church. He had 
resigned from his post on December 31.

A statement from his First Baptist Church of Birmingham said: 'All of us were saddened by the unexpected news that Richard Shahan was arrested by Homeland Security just moments before his planned flight departure for Frankfurt, Germany.'

'There, he was to assume his new role working with the Children's ministry of Bible Mission International, primarily in Kazakhstan.'

Members of the church had paid tribute earlier in the year to 52-year-old Mrs Shahan, who had two grandchildren. 

Bill Gladden, a church member and 
former attorney who works with the church on legal issues, described her as 'a lovely person.'

The Mayor of Homewood said the murder had shaken the usually peaceful area.

'The City of Homewood has been blessed 
for situations like this to be the exception and not the norm,' Scott 
McBrayer told AL.com.

'As with any other senseless act of violence, our thoughts and prayers go out to the family so deeply affected.'

Shahan is due to be extradited to Alabama for a hearing on January 7.
