It's one of the most exclusive addresses in New York City and Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is just short change away - relatively - from owning it.

The steel tycoon and owner of Chelsea Football Club has almost got his hands on an entire mansion on Fifth Avenue - he just has two more apartments to acquire and another $23million to stump up.

The 46-year-old paid $75 million last month for a majority chunk of historic Berwind Mansion at 828 Fifth Avenue.

Prime position: The Fifth Avenue property overlooks Central Park

He has been busy inking deals to 
acquire the remainder of the building so that he can eventually create 
his own lavish entire mansion overlooking Central Park.

Two people still stand in the way of 
that dream however. One will not leave for another year, while a 
long-time resident is demanding more money, according to PageSix.com.

A fifth-floor apartment, which 
according to public records has been owned by Eugenia Olazabal since 
1981, is causing the billionaire problems.

PageSix.com claims the Russian has offered her $15 million but she is holding out for $23 million.

Meanwhile, fashion designer Adolfo Sardina, who owned a duplex in the mansion, caved in to the billionaire's offer.

Exclusive: The Fifth Avenue home was built for a coal tycoon in the 1890s

Ornate: The Fifth Avenue building is based on an Italian Renaissance design

According to PageSix.com, Abramovich 
offered between $10 million and $15 million to buy Sardina out and the 
wealthy men 'came to an agreement.. but Adolfo insisted he needed a year
 to move out, which Abramovich agreed to,' the source said.

If he achieves full-ownership of the 
Rennaissance-stle mansion, Abramovich will be fulfilling the dream of 
the building's late owner, real estate developer Howard Ronson.

Ronson turned the block into 
apartments in the 1970s but had planned to return it to its original 
mansion state. He died in 2007.

Abramovich, who is worth $10.2 billion, 
will share the eight-bedroom home with Dasha Zhukova, the mother of his 
two youngest children.

He
 set a new record for the highest amount ever paid for a co-op in the 
city, when he sealed the multi-million-dollar property deal, according 
to the New York Post.

Extravagant: Abramovich owns the world's largest yacht, Eclipse, which cost him $250 million

Finished in 1896, the luxurious Fifth
 Avenue building was once described as 'about as close to Versailles as 
residential New York has to offer'.

The
 building, designed in the Italian Renaissance style and built for a 
coal baron called Joseph Berwind, overlooks Central Park zoo and has a 
full-time doorman, according to Street Easy.

Abramovich's
 latest home includes a penthouse, triplex and maisonette in the 
decadent building which is made up of five apartments.

He may not have the whole
 building just yet, but Abramovich will have a 15,080 sq ft home 
complete with wine cellar, ballroom, ten bathrooms and roof top terrace 
with views over the park.

'Part of it is buying a dream of 
eventually owning one of the greatest pieces of real estate of New York,
 a mansion on Fifth Avenue directly across from one of the better parts 
of Central Park,' Pam Liebman, president of Corcoran Group, told the Wall Street Journal.

Paradise: The billionaire also has a luxury home in St Barts, where he holds lavish New Year's Eve parties

City living: Abramovich also owns a sprawling London mansion

Many original features of the grand home remain, including gilded flowers, and ornate wood carvings and plasterwork.

Interior designer Alberto Pinto is behind the makeover of the triplex, which has a 34ft ballroom with Louis XV-style plaster ceilings and ornate angels carved over the fireplace.

The Fifth Avenue home will be perfect addition to Abramovich's luxury portfolio, which already includes a string of luxury homes in cities across the world, private jets, and the world's largest yacht, Eclipse, which cost him $250 million in 2010.
