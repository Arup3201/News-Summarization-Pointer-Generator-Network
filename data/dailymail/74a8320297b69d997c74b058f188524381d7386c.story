British aid worker Alan Henning who was brutally beheaded by Islamic State extremists was ‘certain he was going to be freed’ in the lead up to his horrific death, a fellow hostage has claimed.

Mr Henning, 47, from Salford, Manchester, is said to have ‘laughed and joked’ with other detainees when he was kidnapped by ISIS on Boxing Day last year and apparently thought he was going to be released without harm.

The father of two, who had been in Syria providing aid to refugees when he was taken hostage, was murdered by the masked British militant known as Jihadi John in a video posted online on Friday.

Details of his time in captivity have now been revealed by Seif al-Idlibi, an opposition activist who was held hostage with the British taxi driver when he was first kidnapped.

In his first detailed account of the ordeal, Mr Idlibi - who was freed in January after the detention centre he was being held at was liberated by Syrian rebels - said Mr Henning was 'very relaxed' in captivity.

He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘He didn’t understand who his captors were and he was convinced he would be released soon.

‘He was not afraid – he thought it was just a regular security check and that he would be released soon.'

According to Mr Idlibi, the detention centre where he was held overnight with Mr Henning was located in the northwestern town of al-Dana, in the depths of a government building which ISIS captured in November 2012.

He said Mr Henning was interrogated by three separate captors throughout the night, including the masked British militant Jihadi John and the Isil-appointed emir of the local town Idlib, Abu Dujana Al-Tunsi.

However, he said Mr Henning remained in good spirits and later laughed and joked with his cellmates who woke him to alert him to his snoring.

Mr Idlibi said he laughed and apologised, saying he had been awake for 24 hours.

The next morning, a guard came for Mr Henning, telling him to bring his belongings with him. Kissing his cellmates goodbye, Mr Idlibi said it was clear that he thought the worst was over.

‘He was crying with empathy as he said goodbye – he thought he was being freed and leaving us behind. We don’t know where they took him,' he said.

Instead of being freed, Mr Henning was transferred deeper into the extensive prison network of ISIS.

He was not sighted again in public until the jihadist group released a video showing the beheading of British aid worker, David Haines, two weeks ago.

Then, on Friday, Mr Henning became the fourth Westerner and second Briton  to be murdered by the Islamic State.

As before, the video depicted Mr Henning, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, kneeling alongside his black-clad, masked killer.

In the recording he recited: ‘Because of our Parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic State, I, as a member of the British public, will now pay the price for that decision.’

Yesterday, the grieving family of Mr Henning joined hundreds of mourners, including leaders of the Muslim community, at a service of reflection.

His wife Barbara, and two children Lucy, 17, and Adam, 15, were embraced in emotional scenes at St Mary’s Church in Eccles, Manchester.

The Rev Cyprian Yobera asked the congregation to have understanding even when ‘our world seems to be infested by those who do not value life’.

He added: ‘It is difficult at a time like this when we have to deal with tragedy that we cannot understand. Everybody feels like they knew him, even those of us who never met him.’

The streets of Eccles were transformed into a sea of yellow and ribbons adorned with the words ‘Alan, our hero’ were fixed to every lamppost, bench and tree.

Mrs Henning, 45, said that news of the killing had left the family ‘numb with grief’.

She praised her husband as a ‘decent, caring human being’ whose ‘interest was in the welfare of others’.

The Bishop of Manchester, the Rt Rev Dr David Walker, described Mr Henning as a martyr who had paid ‘the ultimate sacrifice’ for his good deeds.

He said: 'The Christian faith is centred around a man who did good, enormous good, and who actually paid with his life for it.

‘Alan stands in that fine tradition. Since the time of Jesus Christ, we have a word ‘martyrdom’ in the Christian faith for it, those who do good and end up paying the ultimate sacrifice for it.’

Mr Henning was a well-known figure in the town due to his tireless charity work and lengthy career driving taxis.

One message attached to Eccles Cross in the town centre read: ‘Whilst we come to terms with this living nightmare, your suffering is over. You leave an irreplaceable gap in all our lives.'

‘A special man with a heart of gold,’ read another.

Friends of Mr Henning – known affectionately as Gadget due to his love of technology - stood on the Greater Manchester town’s quiet streets yesterday sharing stories about him.

Anthony Flannery condemned the ‘appalling’ killing and expressed his disappointment that the Government had not done more to free the hostage.

The retired 64-year-old said: ‘It’s harder to take because he was really doing some good.

‘We really had a little light of hope that he might be coming back, especially when we heard Cameron making a speech about how we don’t give in to terrorists.

Mr Flannery added: ‘It’s hard to describe how I feel. It’s like losing a part of yourself.’

‘He knew the dangers and he went forward because he was all about helping people. He had a good heart.'

Colin Livesey described his brother-in-law's killers as 'scum', adding: 'I hope they get what's coming to them'

Manchester Central Mosque Iman Asim Hussain yesterday criticised ISIS, calling them ‘misguided individuals’.

A visibly emotional Shameela Islam-Fulfigar, a doctor at Tameside Hospital who was part of the last convoy on which Mr Henning travelled, said: ‘The world lost an honourable and remarkable hero.’

She has set up an online memorial fund, in consultation with Mrs Henning, aiming to raise £20,000.

Dr Islam-Fulfigar said she wanted to show the taxi driver’s children that ‘their father’s death was not in vain and that the work that Alan was so committed to will also continue’.
