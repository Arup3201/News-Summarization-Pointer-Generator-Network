She is known as the 'zoo lady' to neighbours and friends.

And with 70 animals ranging from cats to raccoons living in her bungalow, Jordan Ryan appears to be living up to her nickname. 

The animal lover shares her home with 20 snakes and 10 lizards, as well as three dogs and a cat.

All but the rabbits and alpaca live inside the Carmarthenshire home she shares with her boyfriend and the pair have had to organise set play times for their growing collection of animals, so none get eaten or attacked.

Miss Ryan, 24, started collecting the animals seven years ago.

Miss Ryan, 24, has earned the nickname the zoo lady because of her large collection of animals at her home 

But but her collection got even larger when she started to work as a veterinary nurse. 

Eventually her mother asked her to move into the flat next door after she grew uneasy with the increasing number of snakes beneath her bed.

She said: 'I have always been obsessed with pets and animals - even as a kid I was bringing snakes and lizards home and hiding them under my bed.

'Most of my animals now are rescue animals and they're all well cared for.

The couple have turned their home into a zoo, with snakes and lizards inhabiting rooms inside their bungalow

Mr Fletcher (left) says he would like a lemur to add to the collection, while the alpacas (right) live outside 

The couple have started opening their home to hold charity events so people can see their collection of animals

Three alpacas live on land outside the property, along with rabbits and ferrets who live outside the bungalow

'We have set times when each of them are allowed out for play time to make sure nobody gets eaten.'

Miss Ryan then moved in with her boyfriend, Dean Fletcher, 27, three years later and the pair are thinking of expanding their collection to include lemurs and meerkats.

She added: 'We started with a few snakes and ferrets and it grew from there.

Miss Ryan started collecting snakes, and now has 20 living in the house, along with a raccoon and a hedgehog

A tarantula is one of the animals that has a home in the couple's bungalow alongside lizards and snakes 

'Most of the animals live in the house. We just keep them wherever there's space. I have a room especially for snakes.

'We live in a bungalow with an acre of land. The alpacas, rabbits and ferrets are outside, but everything else is in with us.

'The alpacas will stick their heads through the door and if they're feeling brave they'll steal your toast but that's as far as they get inside.'

She admits she has earned the nickname Zoo Lady and some friends have put of visiting her home in Gorslas because of their fear of snakes. 

Local children now also visit her home animals and Miss Ryan has started doing events for charity. 

Miss Ryan is now at Cardiff University training to be an operating department practitioner, working during surgery at hospital. 

Miss Ryan added: 'Dean wants to get a lemur, that's how we ended up with the raccoons.

'You need a license for a lemur but not for a raccoon so it was a compromise.

'Next we're thinking about meerkats and after that we'll look at a lemur.'
