A dreadlocked Rastafarian cafe owner close to David Cameron during his Oxford student days has been convicted of wounding a customer with a hacksaw.

Hugh ‘Andy’ Anderson, now 67, served the future Prime Minister as they listened to reggae music in his Hi-Lo Jamaican Eating House in the Eighties.

But now Anderson – whose ramshackle cafe is opposite the house Mr Cameron used as student digs – has been found guilty of unlawfully wounding social worker Sean Tizard.

Reading Crown Court heard how Anderson was wielding  a hacksaw and meted out a ‘continual rain of blows’ on his victim, who was visiting Oxford from London in October 2010.

He suffered cuts to his face, hands and chest, the court was told.

Anderson will be sentenced later this month.

Trusted: Mr Cameron used to look after Anderson's son during his days at Oxford University

Anderson has recalled how Mr Cameron used to visit his restaurant ‘once or twice a week’.

He said he trusted – and liked – the future Prime Minister so much that he often asked him to look after his young son, Daniel.

He said: ‘David was one of our regulars. I think he liked the atmosphere. We get a real mixture  of people here.’

Rastafarians smoke cannabis as part of their religion, but Mr Anderson said Mr Cameron had never smoked with him.

Accusations that Mr Cameron smoked cannabis while at Oxford have dogged him for years but he has always refused to either confirm or deny the rumours.
