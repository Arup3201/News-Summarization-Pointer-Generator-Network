A 20-year-old man has died in hospital after being taken ill at Global Gathering dance festival.

An investigation has been launched after the man fell ill on the first night of the two-day event at Long Marston airfield near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.

Police said the man was taken from the festival site to Warwick Hospital at about 11pm last night but was pronounced dead at 1am after attempts to save him failed.

A force spokesman said his death is currently being treated as unexplained.

Post-mortem tests are expected to be carried out in due course to determine the cause and exact circumstances surrounding the death.

The man's family have been informed.

More than 50,000 festival-goers have descended on Global Gathering this weekend to see the likes of Prodigy, Tinie Tempah, Sub Focus and Katy B perform.

It is thought the man became unwell while headliners Chase & Status took to the main stage and David Guetta performed on a nearby smaller stage last night.

A spokesman for Global Gathering said staff were assisting police with their investigation.

She said: ‘Everyone at GlobalGathering is deeply saddened by this tragic news.

‘Our sincerest thoughts and condolences are with the family and friends at this time.

‘We are assisting Warwickshire Police with their ongoing investigation.’

The man’s death came as temperatures soared to 28C in Stratford-upon-Avon today and 30C in other parts of the country.

Police have been issuing regular warnings to festival-goers to drink plenty of water so as not to get too dehydrated in the heat.

Last year, 20-year-old Jon Coward died at the festival - which is popular with dance music fans – after apparently having a bad reaction to a hallucinogenic drug.

An inquest found the Liverpool John Moores University student did not intend to kill himself but may have been acting out of character due to drugs when he died on July 29 last year. His body was found in a tree near the festival site.

At the time, his mother Lin warned of the dangers of drug-taking.

She said: ‘We want everyone young and old to understand the potentially devastating consequences of taking mind-altering drugs.

‘No-one knows exactly what they are taking or how they will react to the drugs.’
