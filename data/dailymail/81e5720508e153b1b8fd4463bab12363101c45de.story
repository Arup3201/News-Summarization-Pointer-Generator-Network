An anonymous donor helped to fly a terminally ill medical school graduate home to see his family for his 32nd birthday.

Dr. Joshua Gaines of Lubbock, Texas died last Thursday morning before he ever got to celebrate his birthday on August 2, but he was able to spend time with his family late Wednesday night before passing away the next morning.

Last February, Gaines learned that he'd go into residency at Cleveland Clinic, but one week later he had some bad news that would alter his career path forever, reported KCBD.

In February 2013, after years of dedicated study, Joshua Gaines, age 30, received the news that he had matched at Cleveland Clinic for an Anesthesiology Residency but he also learned of his deteriorating health

Josh had to be rushed to the emergency room for abdominal pain that far surpassed the aches and pains he'd experienced in the past.

Josh discovered that he metastic colorectal cancer., a fatal disease with a median survival rate of just 29 months.

'He had all these plans, and he wanted to make a difference, make an impact, and help heal people as a physician,' said Gaines sister-in-law Michelle Gaines.

Instead of working as a physician at Cleveland Clinic, Josh spent a year and a half undergoing aggressive cancer therapy including radiation, chemotherapy, and surgical treatments.

'He has handled it like a master. I mean, he's just been so strong and brave. The whole time, thinking of others and how what was happening was impacting us rather than how it was impacting him,' Michelle said.

Josh underwent aggressive cancer treatment but when his family discovered is liver was failing they knew his days were few

When family discovered that Gaines â€˜liver was failing, they knew his days were few.The family reached out for help online and shared his heart breaking story of both success and illness.

A Texas Tech anonymous donor made the trip possible for Gaines.Josh arrived by private plane at the Lubbock airport late on Wednesday night. An ambulance met him at the airport and he was rushed to UMC.

'We are so thankful; we can never say thank you enough. I'm just so amazed at how the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center family has come together to help one of their own in this situation,' said Michelle.

Even though Gaines never got to experience working as a doctor, he donated his body to science so that he could help others in the medical profession find more advanced cancer treatments.
