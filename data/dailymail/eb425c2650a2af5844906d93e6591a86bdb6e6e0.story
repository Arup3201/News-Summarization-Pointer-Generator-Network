World number two Henrik Stenson shared the lead with England's world number 346 Eddie Pepperell after the third round at the Nordea Masters in Malmo.

Stenson shot the best round of the day, an eight-under-par 64, to move to on 13 under overall and lead the way with Pepperell, who shot a 65.

The home favourite racked up seven birdies and an eagle two at the seventh alongside one bogey to put himself in pole position ahead of the final day.

Breakthrough: English youngster Eddie Pepperell is joint leader heading into the final day at Malmo

Inexperience: The 23-year-old has just one tour victory to his name to date in a challenger event two years ago

All square: Henrik Stenson of Sweden, playing in front of his home crowd, is tied for the lead

Neck and neck: Both men are on 13 under heading into the final round on Sunday

Pepperell, 23, whose only professional victory to date came on the Challenge Tour two years ago, fired eight birdies and looked set to finish the day with the outright lead, only for a bogey at the 17th to drop him back.

Scotland's Stephen Gallacher and Spain's Alvaro Quiros were a shot off the pace.

The former shot a 65, also picking up eight birdies and a bogey, while Quiros went round in 66.France's Victor Dubuisson and Welshman Bradley Dredge were also well-placed on 11 under and 10 under respectively.

Pepperell was understandably delighted with his day.

He told www.europeantour.com: 'I had great fun out there. I felt comfortable out there.

'I'm really happy with myself. The game feels pretty good.

'It was a great start with three birdies in a row. I was flying and I missed good opportunities on four and five. Then I had a sticky spell with my swing, but hung in there. I would like to have finished with a birdie on the last two holes, but I'm not too unhappy about that.

'Henrik is tied with me so it is going to be a great day tomorrow, but I've just keep to keep focused on my game and do what I've been doing. If I do that I'll have a shot come the last and I'll enjoy it.

'Henrik is one of the best players in the world, he's in fine form and it is his home country. I couldn't ask for much more really from a final round. It's going to be really exciting for me and I've got to make it exciting for him.'

On his eagle at the seventh, Stenson said: 'I knew it was going to be inside 10 feet when I hit it and it landed about five feet away, had a little release and hop and went in.'

The Swede added: 'The crowds have been great. I haven't played in front of home crowds for a while and with the success I've had I really feel the support. I'm going to enjoy tomorrow and try to be up there tomorrow with nine to go and try to win this tournament for them.

'It would be great to do it. I've not won in Sweden before and obviously I would like to do that in my career. It seems like I'm going to have a chance tomorrow, but there is a long way to go and a lot of good players up there.

'I'm sure I need to stick to my play and be there when it really matters tomorrow.'
