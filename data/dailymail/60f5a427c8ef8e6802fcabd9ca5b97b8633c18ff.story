It's been five decades since Britain said goodbye to said of its most beautiful and picturesque railway stations as the nation began to scale back its vast train network in a move that would see more than 2,000 stations closed.

Dr Richard Beeching's report on the state of the railways saw the network scaled back by around a third and stations in rural beauty spots up and down the country lost forever.

This collection of images show the very last journeys made by locomotives on dozens of rural lines across the country before they were ripped up under the Beeching Axe.

Many of the pictures from the 1960s depict hoards of rail enthusiasts clutching their cameras as they grab a final photo of a steam engine on their local branch line.

Others show the locos with funeral wreaths hung from the front to reflect the sense of loss and grief felt by trains buffs and commuters alike.

And another series of images show a young David Steel MP trying to quell a mob of protesters angry at the closure of the famous Waverley route between Edinburgh and Carlisle which left vast swathes of the Borders region without a rail connection.

Hundreds of photos have been compiled 
in a new book 'Dr Beeching's Axe 50 Years On' to mark the landmark 
anniversary of the infamous decision to rip up 4,500 miles of track.

The
anniversary comes at a time when the many of the derelict lines, most 
of them in remote rural locations, are enjoying something of a revival.

Over
the last 30 years enthusiasts and volunteers have worked to reopen some
of the axed lines and have turned them into successful tourist 
attractions, such as the Swanage Railway in Dorset.

Many coastal routes such as the Dorset Express (pictured in May 1967) were axed by Dr Beeching in his cuts t to rail services

Now numerous local authorities are 
looking into the prospect of doing the same to relieve congestion on the
roads and restore public transport.

At
the time of the infamous report 'The Reshaping of British Railways' by 
Dr Richard Beeching, the chairman of the British Railways, motorways 
were being built across the country at a rapid rate and the car was seen
as the future.

But, due to today's record costs of running a car, public transport has never been in more demand.

Julian
Holland, the author of the 'Dr Beeching's Axe' book said: ‘The book is 
meant to be a memorial to all that was lost and I have tried to record 
all the lines that were closed.

Protestors blocked the line at Newcastleton to fight against closures and Liberal Democrat MP David Steel tried to restore order

Dr Richard Beeching oversaw the closures of thousands of railways in the 1960s to the dismay of passengers and rail staff. The last train from Horwich to Bolton was decorated with a wreath in September 1965

The Southbound Pine Express from Bath Green Park (pictured in September 1961) was one of the services to be cut under Beeching's Axe

‘But there is a serious point to it in
that a lot of the closures under the Beeching Axe weren't really 
necessary and many of them are now needed more than ever.

‘The first motorway was built in 1959 and the car was the future and the railways were costing too much to run.

‘But the survey of the British railways that formed the report was pretty outrageous - it was flawed.

‘The
survey took place in just one week in April 1961 and a third of the 
route that was surveyed carried only one per cent of passenger and 
freight traffic.

‘It didn't take into account seasonal traffic flows to the seaside for example.

‘Most of the lines that were closed were in remote rural areas like in mid-Wales and northern England.

Dr Richard Beeching's report saw some 2,128 railway stations closed across Britain, with 650 lines of railway ripped up in Scotland alone and many of the nation's towns left without direct access to train services.

One of the largest lines to close was the Waverley route from Edinburgh to Carlisle.

The closure left the Scottish borders the only area of Britain without a railway line and left the town of Hawick, with a population of some 16,000 at the time, the furthest town away from a station.

Rail passengers from the Scottish Borders town would have to travel either 42 miles to Carlisle or 56 miles to Edinburgh to catch a train.

But Hawick was not the only town in Britain with a population exceeding 10,000 left without a station.

Some of the biggest and most well known towns in Britain whose stations were closed after the Beeching report include:

‘Seaside lines such as Minehead in Somerset and Ilfracombe in Devon suffered the most and with no through trains from London, people just stopped going there.

‘The railways might have been expensive to run in the 1950s and '60s but it was still cheaper than it is today.

‘In real terms the cost to the taxpayer in 1961 was £1.6billion but today the privatised railways are subsidised to the tune of £3.5billion.

‘The decision to deatroy 4,500 route miles of railway, 2,500 stations and 67,700 jobs in 1963 was short-sighted.

‘Many of these lines are needed today. Rail passenger numbers are increasing today because the car is becoming so expensive to run and because of the level of congestion on our roads.’

British Rail was losing £140m a year when Dr Richard Beeching took over as chairman of the British Transport Commission.

His solution, announced on 27 March 1963, was to 'make railways pay'.

Dr Beeching wrote two reports proposing cuts to British Railway services.

The first was entitled The Reshaping of British Railways and published in 1963. It was based on a survey carried out over one week in 
April 1961.

A third of the route surveyed carried only one 
per cent of passenger and freight traffic.

The second report in 1965 was called The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes.

The
first report suggested that 2,363 stations and 5,000 miles of railway 
line should be closed - accounting for 55 per cent of stations and 30 
per cent of route miles.

The Conservative government welcomed the report, but British people living in rural areas were against the plans.

Following the reports 2,128 stations and more than 67,000 British 
Rail jobs were cut. More than 4,500 miles of track was lost.

Closures stopped in the early 1970s and nearly 30 stretches of railway have since been reopened, including the line between London and Swanage in Dorset.
