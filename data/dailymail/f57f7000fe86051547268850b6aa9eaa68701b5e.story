A father has been arrested for allegedly beating his 14-year-old daughter with a belt after he learned that she had chosen a black teenager to be her dance partner.

Aaron Aranza, 37, allegedly attacked his daughter on April 11 while she was having a party at her maternal grandmother's house in Houston, Texas to practice quinceanera dancing.

She had chosen a friend, a 15-year-old African-American boy, to dance with her, police said.

On learning this, Aranza became angry and stormed outside, where people at the party were gathered, and told them the party was over, the Houston Chronicle reported.

He demanded to know if she wanted the boy as her dance partner, using a racial slur to refer to him and saying to his daughter: 'Are you serious?'

Aranza then allegedly pushed the teenage boy, saying: 'I don't care that you are a kid.'

He then allegedly took his daughter into the house, hit her with a belt, dragged her and threw her so that she hit her arm on a coffee table.

He is being held in the Harris County Jail in lieu of $20,000 bail.
