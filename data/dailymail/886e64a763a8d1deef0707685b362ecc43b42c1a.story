Arrest: Verna McClain has been charged with capital murder in the killing of 28-year-old Kala Marie Golden, after she shot her and stole her baby

A mother was shot dead by a nurse who kidnapped her newborn baby.

Kayla Golden, 28, was blasted seven times with a handgun when Verna McClain reportedly pulled up alongside her in a car.

Despite her injuries she tried to stop McClain snatching three day-old Keegan but was knocked to the ground and later died.

Police eventually traced McClain – who had reportedly targeted Miss Golden at random – to a home near Houston, Texas. Keegan was found safe and well.

According to U.S. reports, McClain – a mother of three – had in recent weeks told her family she was adopting a child.

After allegedly killing Miss Golden she told her sister Corina Jackson she now had a fourth child in her family.

McClain is now facing a capital murder charge which means she could be given the death penalty if convicted.

The horror began when Miss Golden took Keegan to her local paediatrician in Houston for a routine check-up on Tuesday afternoon. McClain and an unidentified male passenger are said to have pulled up alongside Miss Golden’s pick-up truck in their blue Lexus before she opened fire.

Witnesses described the sound as being like ‘pop pop pop’ and that even after being shot blood-stained Miss Golden managed to try to grab her baby back.

Lieutenant Dan Norris of the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office said: ‘The child was being put into the suspect vehicle and that’s when the mother tried to get into the car.

‘The car sped away, knocking the lady to the ground.’

The Lexus was traced to McClain’s sister’s house in Houston and when a SWAT team burst in they found Keegan. From there investigators were able to find McClain herself in another home just outside the city.

According to a police affidavit obtained by ABC News, McClain has admitted to the shooting and told her sister that she did it because she wanted to ‘adopt’ another child.

She already has three children aged six, ten and 16.

The killing comes only a day after Keegan’s father Keith Schuchardt posted pictures on his Facebook page announcing the baby’s birth.

He wrote: ‘Baby keegan is here. born 4/14/12 6 lbs 15 oz, 20 inches long. Looks like me lol.’ According to U.S .reports he has not even signed the child’s birth certificate yet.

Keegan is currently in the care of social services and his family are waiting for a full background check on them to be finished before they can have the child back.

The baby’s grandmother Linda Golden said she rushed to the scene but was not there in time to say goodbye to her daughter.

She said: ‘I wanted to kiss her before they put her in the ambulance. She died trying to save her baby.’

Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said Miss Golden was in the wrong place at the wrong time and that McClain just wanted any child to add to  her family.

He said: ‘There were statements as indicated in the arrest record that were made by Miss McClain that led us to believe that, in fact, this was an intentional act on her part.

Caught: McClain (pictured right with her sister Yoki) has three children and is a registered nurse

Proud: Golden with Mr Schuchardt, who had announced the birth of their son on Facebook on Saturday

‘Not that Miss Golden was targeted specifically, but that this was part of a plan to kidnap a child.’

McClain’s alleged male accomplice was also arrested but had not been charged last night.
