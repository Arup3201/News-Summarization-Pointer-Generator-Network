Bomber: Turkish officials identified the suicide bomber who attacked the US embassy as convicted terrorist Ecevit Sanli, pictured

The first pictures of the suicide bomber who attacked the U.S. Embassy in Ankara on Friday have emerged as Turkish officials identified him as convicted terrorist Ecevit Sanli.

Armed with six kilograms of TNT - enough to blow up a two-story building - and a hand grenade, Sanli, killed himself and a Turkish security guard in the brazen attack, which has been labelled an act of terror by U.S. officials.

As the U.S. flag flew at half-staff today and security at the embassy was heightened, details about the 40-year-old assailant emerged.

Sanli was not linked to al Qaeda, rather he was a member of the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, or DHKP-C. He had spent five years in prison on terrorism charges after he was arrested in 1997 for alleged involvement in attacks on two official buildings in Istanbul.

But he was released in 2001 after being diagnosed with a brain disorder that he suffered during a prison hunger strike that killed dozens of inmates.

He fled Turkey after he was freed but managed to come back 'illegally' using a fake ID, Turkish officials said. It wasn't clear how long before Friday's attack he returned to his home country.

DHKP-C, which has claimed responsibility for assassinations and bombings since the 1970s but has been relatively quiet in recent years. Compared to al Qaeda, it has not been seen as a strong terrorist threat.

Sanli's motives were still unclear. But some Turkish government officials have linked the attack to the arrest last month of dozens of suspected members of the group in a nationwide sweep.

Speculation has also abounded that the bombing was related to the perceived support of the U.S. for Turkey's harsh criticism of the regime in Syria, whose brutal civil war has forced tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to seek shelter in Turkey. But Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denied that.

Sanli was diagnosed with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and released on probation in 2001, following the introduction of legislation that allowed hunger strikers with the disorder to get appropriate treatment.

The syndrome is a malnutrition-related brain illness that affects vision, muscle coordination and memory and that can cause hallucinations.

Sanli fled Turkey after his release and was wanted by Turkish authorities. He was convicted in absentia in 2002.

On Saturday, a street in front of the security checkpoint where the explosion knocked a door off its hinges and littered the road with debris was blocked off. Police vehicles were parked in streets surrounding the building.

The guard who was killed was standing outside the checkpoint. The U.S. ambassador on Saturday attended his funeral in a town just outside of Ankara. A Turkish TV journalist was seriously wounded and two other guards had lighter wounds.

The White House was quick to declared the bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Ankara an 'act of terror' on Friday as Westerners in Turkey were warned to be vigilant.

Sanli detonated his stash of TNT outside the embassy in the Turkish capital at 1.15pm local time, killing a guard and himself.

Turkish officials blamed the attack on domestic leftists but U.S. officials were not immediately clear who was responsible.

New Secretary of State, John Kerry, who was sworn in as Hillary Clinton's replacement on Friday, faced a tough introduction to the job as officials
 in Istanbul warned there could be further outrages.

Didem Tuncay, 38, a television journalist who was reportedly at the embassy to get a U.S. visa, was said to be 'seriously wounded' but not in a life-threatening condition.

Two other guards sustained 
lighter wounds in the blast, Turkey's interior minister, Muammer Guler, told 
reporters. He said they 'were standing in a more protected area.

He also blamed the attack on a domestic left-wing militant group but 
did not explain why.

The group, DHKP-C, has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States but had been relatively quiet in recent years. The explosion occurred inside the 
security checkpoint at the side entrance to the U.S. embassy, which was 
being used by staff.

Police and ambulances swarmed the area and authorities immediately cordoned it off.

TV footage showed the embassy door 
blown off its hinges. The windows of nearby businesses were also 
shattered by the power of the blast, and debris littered the ground and 
across the road. The inside of the embassy did not appear to be damaged.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan said the attack demonstrated a need for international 
cooperation against terrorism and was aimed at disturbing Turkey's 
'peace and prosperity.'

'But we will stand firm and we will overcome this together,' he said.

In a statement, the U.S. Embassy thanked Turkey for 'its solidarity and outrage over the incident.'

The embassy building is heavily 
protected and located near several other embassies in Ankara, including 
that of Germany and France.

The Hurriyet newspaper said staff at the 
embassy took shelter in 'safe room' inside the compound soon after the 
explosion.

Aftermath: Phones were not being answered at the embassy

'We can confirm a terrorist blast at a
 check point on the perimeter of our embassy compound in Ankara, Turkey,
 at 1.13pm local time,' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland 
said in Washington.

'We are working closely with the 
Turkish national police to make a full assessment of the damage and the 
casualties, and to begin an investigation,' she said on Friday.

Turkish police were examining security cameras around the embassy.

U.S. diplomatic facilities in Turkey 
have been targeted previously by terrorists. In 2008, an attack blamed 
on al-Qaida-affiliated militants outside the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul 
left three assailants and three policemen dead.

Elsewhere, terrorists attacked a U.S. 
mission in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11 last year, killing U.S. 
Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The attackers in 
Libya were suspected to have ties to Islamist extremists, and one is in 
custody in Egypt.

Britain's Foreign Secretary William 
Hague condemned the attack 'in the strongest terms,' and said 
Turkey and the U.S. will get the U.K.'s full support as they seek to 
hold those responsible to account.

Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet 
Davutoglu, speaking to reporters during a visit to Belgrade, Serbia, 
said he was saddened that the attacked had occurred in Turkey.

'We have always shown great sensitivity to the protection of foreign missions and we will continue to do so,' he said.

Homegrown Islamic militants tied to 
al-Qaeda have also carried out suicide bombings in Istanbul, Turkey's 
bustling commercial center. In a 2003 attack on the British consulate, a
 suspected Islamic militant rammed an explosive-laden pickup truck into 
the main gate, killing 58 people, including the British consul-general.

Turkey is also being deeply affected 
by the brutal civil war in neighboring Syria, and has become a harsh 
critic of President Bashar Assad's regime there. The war has left at 
least 60,000 people dead so far, according to the U.N., and Turkey is 
sheltering tens of thousands of Syrian refugees.

The first of six Patriot missile 
batteries being deployed to Turkey to protect the country against attack
 from Syria was just declared operational and placed under NATO command.
 Others are expected to become operational in the coming days.
