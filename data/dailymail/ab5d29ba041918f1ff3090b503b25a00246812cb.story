The man in possession of the football the Seattle Seahawks carried to the NFC title says he'd happily trade it to wide receiver Jermaine Kearse for tickets to the Superbowl game schedule on the eve of a jail term.

Scott Shelton says he's facing 'several months' behind bars in relation to a 2013 weapons possession bust. The Superbowl happens to be scheduled on his final night of freedom.

So far the 32-year-old has already refused a $20,000 offer from a sports memorabilia dealer, saying he will only release the ball to Kearse.

The bust included finding a stolen shotgun in his Washington state home.  

Kearse ran the ball in for a touchdown in the final moments of Sunday's game then threw it into the end zone seats in a victory celebration.

It ended up in the hands of Shelton.

'Everyone's going crazy,' he told KOMO. 'I can't believe I got this ball!'

Shelton has every move of those final seconds seared into his memory.

'Wilson drops back. Throws a strike to Kearse. Pulls down the game-winning catch. He got up and chucked it into the stands. And it bounced about four times. And right into my lap. Just right into my chest. Like, just, boom! Just like that. And I jumped up into the seat and just screaming!'

He continued: 'It was just amazing! Amazing feeling! We just won the game. I got this thrown to me, by Kearse. It was, it was like a dream come true. It still is. I haven't woke up yet, you know.'#

Though a sports memorabilia dealer has offered him $20,000 he says he wants Kearse to have it back. 

At a news conference Monday the Seahawk called the toss into the stands an impulse in the moment.  

Shelton says the ball has been a comfort as the unemployed father of two faces personal problems 

'That throw,' he said, 'It was more so just a sigh of just frustration. Just letting a lot of frustration throughout that game out. I just tried to throw it as far as possible. It was just something that happened in the moment.'

Kearse reconsidered and called Shelton Monday to ask for the ball back.  

'We were just talking about the game. He told me he wanted to trade his game helmet signed by the team and his jersey, for the ball. And then he asked me what (else) I wanted for the ball,' Shelton said. 'And I said 'honestly, it would be nice to go see you guys whip New England in the Super Bowl.' So he's going to see what he can do about that. But I told him I wouldn't give it up unless it was going to him. I wouldn't want anyone else to have it.'

He said some autographed team memorabilia would also be nice, if he couldn't get tickets.

Currently without a job and a father to two, Shelton says the ball has been a much-needed lift in his life. 

On 2 p.m. the day after the Superbowl he's even set to start serving a several month sentence in jail.

'This is a cool ball, man,' he said. 'To think that this is the one that I watched sail. The pass is still re-playing in my mind. It's been going all night and all day - really, that really happened!'
