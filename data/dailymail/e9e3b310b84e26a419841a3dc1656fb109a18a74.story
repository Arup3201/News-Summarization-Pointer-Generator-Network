The first installment of American vampire series Twilight was the most counterfeited DVD over the festive period.

The film industry's anti-piracy organisation FACT seized hundreds of thousands of illegal copies of the The Twilight Series: Breaking Dawn - Part 1.

Starring Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner, the film is part of a romantic fantasy series based on the novels of Stephanie Meyer.

Stars: Actors Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson who star in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1, which was found to be most counterfeited DVD in Britain

Entwined: Kristen Stewart stars as Bella Swan and Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen in the hit film series

Illegal street and market sales of the film easily outstripped sales of all other counterfeit films in Britain, highlighting its popularity.

It is the first time in four years that a Harry Potter film has failed to be the most pirated film at Christmas, according to the annual counterfeit chart.

Other fakes highly in demand include: Avengers Assemble, The Hunger Games and Brave.

FACT say they believe the case of Anton Vickerman case in May has led to a huge decline in online piracy crime.

Public: The private lives of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have been in the spotlight after it was alleged the couple split-up then got back together after she had an affair

Pushed out: It is the first time in four years a film in the Harry Potter film series has not been the most counterfeited title at Christmas

Popular: Avengers Assemble, left, and Brave, right, have also proved popular on the black market, ranking second and fourth on the counterfeit list respectively

Vickerman, from Gateshead, who operated surfthechannel.com and offered links to infringed movies, was jailed for four years.

FACT spokesman Eddy Leviten said : 'This year has been quite a turning point. People who thought they could get away with running a piracy site have found they could end up in prison.

'There have been other cases where defendants changed their pleas to guilty-partly because of this case and partly because of things we have been doing to tackle online piracy.

'There is still a problem in Britain with pirated DVDs being sold by Chinese criminals, but this form of crime is much diminished.

'We have seized more than 500,000 in the last part of the year compared with 800,000 in 2011 and more than 1million in 2010.'
