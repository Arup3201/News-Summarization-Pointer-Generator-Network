Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received another 150 calls after a fresh appeal for information was aired on Dutch television.

The Metropolitan Police team is trying to identify fair-haired men - who may be Dutch or German  - who were seen lurking near the apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where the girl was snatched from.

The new calls will raise hopes that police can make a breakthrough in the hunt for Madeleine who vanished on May 3, 2007.

Wanted: E-fits of fair-haired men who may be Dutch or Scandinavian who were seen lurking near the apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, which Madeleine McCann was snatched from. Police launched an appeal on Dutch television last night. Detectives believe they could be the same person

Dutch appeal: Chief Inspector Andy Redwood calls on Dutch viewers to report themselves if they were in the area at the time of the girl's disappearance in 2007, during a broadcast of Opsporing Verzocht on Dutch television

Breakthrough? Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann received 150 calls from Holland after a TV broadcast there last night

Her parents Kate and Gerry said they are
'genuinely hopefully' that police can make progress in the 
investigation after a special BBC Crimewatch broadcast.

During
the show, two new e-fits of a man were broadcast, while police said 
they had effectively ruled out a previous key sighting of a different 
man carrying a little girl - suggesting Madeleine may have been taken 
later than previously thought.

Detectives want to trace two unidentified men – with blonde or fair hair and possibly German or Scandinavian – who were seen in the vicinity of Ocean Club.

Based on several sightings, they issued two e-fits which ‘may or may not be the same person’.

One is of a thin white man, aged 30-35, with spots on his face possibly caused by shaving.

On both occasions he had black sunglasses with a thick frame and was wearing a black leather jacket.

The second e-fit, based on a description by a different witness, was again near the McCanns’ holiday apartment.

An appeal was shown last night in Holland on a programme called Opsporing Verzocht, and will feature on the German programme Aktenzeichen XY...ungelost tonight.

Fresh calls from the Netherlands come after Scotland Yard received 730 calls and 212 emails in the biggest ever response to a Crimewatch appeal.

Detectives
believe a sighting of a man carrying a blonde girl 500 yards from the 
McCanns’ holiday apartment is of ‘vital importance’.

But
the account of Irish holidaymakers who saw the suspect has been called 
into question because they originally said they were ‘60 to 80 per cent 
sure’ it was Madeleine’s father Gerry.

Police have however said they are certain Mr McCann is not involved.

Martin and Mary Smith gave police a signed statement when they returned home to Drogheda, County Louth.

Prime suspect: These e-fits are of the man seen carrying a child 500 
yards from the McCanns' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal

Response: After the couple's appeal on BBC Crimewatch(pictured), a number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched Madeleine

Search: Madeleine's mother said she was 'genuinely hopeful' of a breakthrough

New timeline: The Crimewatch special revealed that police were now looking at Madeleine's abduction as being at 10pm and not 9.15pm

They said they had seen a man carrying a child toward Praia da Luz’s beach at 10pm on the night Madeleine, then aged three, disappeared.

Metodo 3, a detective agency hired by the McCanns, produced two e-fits of the man in 2008 based on the Smiths’ account. 

Crimewatch's Madeline McCann 
special was the most watched edition of the BBC show in its 29 year 
history, attracting more than seven million viewers.

The
hour long programme, which saw Scotland Yard reveal new findings, 
peaked with 7.3 million, 30 per cent of the total audience share in the 
five minutes from 9.25pm.

The
show had an average of 6.7 million viewers, 27.4 per cent of the share,
adding almost three million viewers to the channel's slot average of 
3.9 million, nearly half the audience share enjoyed on Monday.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'It is the highest audience for a Crimewatch programme on record, going back to 2002.'

The BBC does not have audience figures for Crimewatch, pre-dating that. It was first broadcast in 1984.

Monday
night's Crimewatch was up against the popular ITV series Doc Marten 
which drew an average audience of seven million. The previous series 
high on March 31st, 2008, recorded 5.5 million (24 per cent). The ten 
minute update at 10:35pm also attracted 3.3 million (22.5 per cent).

BBC
head of communications Sam Hodges, responding to a criticism on Twitter
it was a 'ghastly ratings chaser', suggested the big audience was 'a 
reflection of the public interest'.

The images were made public this week when Scotland Yard revealed the mystery man is now the prime suspect.

The detective leading the Metropolitan Police investigation is expected to travel to Ireland in the coming weeks.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said he was extremely pleased with the response to Monday night’s Crimewatch appeal.

‘We have now had over 730 calls and 212 emails as a direct result of the specific lines of inquiry we issued concerning events in the lead up to, and on the night of Thursday 3rd May 2007 when Madeleine was abducted,’ he said.

‘Detectives are now trawling through and prioritising that material. This will take time.’

Mr Redwood, who insists Mr McCann had nothing to do with his daughter’s disappearance, said two independent callers had put forward the same name for the suspect.

Another caller gave the name of a man who was known to be in Portugal at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance.

Mr Redwood said officers were waiting to ‘action the information’ and 40 people were ready to take further calls.

With 6.7million viewers, the appeal attracted the biggest Crimewatch audience on record – almost double the average of 3.9 million.

A BBC spokesman said it also had the highest number of calls ever received, more than double the usual number.

The programme’s editor Joe Mather said: ‘Significantly, there were lots of calls from British people who were in Praia da Luz around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance who had never previously spoken to the Met, so there’s lots of information coming through there.

‘They received several names for the key 10pm sighting, the sighting of a man carrying a child toward the beach.

‘Several different names but also several callers mentioned the same name for that man.’
