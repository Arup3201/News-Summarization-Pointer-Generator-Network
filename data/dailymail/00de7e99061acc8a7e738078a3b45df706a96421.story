A member of New York's prestigious Mara family has been charged following accusations he almost beat a student to death at a New Year's Eve party at a luxury Connecticut beach house.

Jack Mara, 22, of Mount Kisco, nephew of the co-owner and president of the New York Giants, John Mara and cousin to Hollywood actresses Rooney and Kate, is facing allegations that he attacked a fellow student with a bottle on New Year's Eve - leaving him hospitalized and almost dead.

The student whose father Frank Mara is also Vice President of Community Relations for the Giants handed himself in to a police station in Fairfield, Connecticut, on Friday on charges of first degree assault and breach of the peace.

A source told Mail Online he will plead not guilty and the family are 'confident he will be acquitted'. He was released on $150,000 bond.

Mara, a student at Fairfield University was allegedly attending a seniors party in the town held at a luxury beach house on New Year's Eve.

He is accused of using a bottle to beat the other man in the head following an altercation.

The full extent of the injuries suffered and current condition of the unidentified 'victim' are not known but a source told the New York Post that he 'would have been dead' if he had not been rushed to hospital and operated on that night.

Frank and his son Jack are central figures in the sprawling but close Mara fold.

Jack
regularly posts pictures from Giants games he attends with his father 
on his various social media profiles where he keeps in touch with many 
members of his extended family.

His father is the youngest son of the 11 children of Giants founder Wellington Mara and his wife Ann.

The Mara family own 50 per cent of the team with Frank's oldest brother, John, at the helm and their brother Chris also in backroom staff.

The Irish-American clan are well-known in New York as well as Hollywood where Jack's cousins actresses Rooney and Kate have become stars in their own right.

Like his son, Frank attended Fairfield University, graduating in 1982.

He lives in Bedford Corners, New York, with his wife Lynn. They have three other sons Sean, Frankie and Owen.   

Jack's
mother Lynn is an artist and teaches sixth grade religion at St Paul's 
in Greenwich. She also sits on the Giants Foundation.
