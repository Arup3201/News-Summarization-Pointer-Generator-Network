An 84-year old man was just trying to cook shrimp for his 70-year-old girlfriend when he accidentally burned down her house leaving four of her pets dead.

A year later, having put the incident behind them, he received a letter telling him that his girlfriend was suing him.

Only she wasn't.

John Pyron of Fort Worth, Texas, was informed that Cecilla Ellison had filed a lawsuit against him for $152,926 plus interest for damage to her home in the 2012 cooking fire.

John Pyron accidentally burned down his girlfriend's house while cooking shrimp for a dinner party. The couple and her dog made it out alive, but unfortunately her two cats and two birds did not

A year after the fire, Cecilla Ellison (left) was as shocked as Pyron (right) when a letter arrived stating that she was suing him for damages. The couple now live together with Ellison caring for Pyron who has health issues

'I guess I was just stunned. I was in shock. I said, 'My God, what's going on?'' Pyron told NBC 5.

But Ellison hadn't filed the suit and was just as shocked as Pyron, who has since moved in with her.

Far from opponents locked in a hostile legal battle, Ellison now cares for him as he has health problems.

'I don't know what I'd do without her,' he said.

The 2012 fire erupted during an August 18, 2012, dinner party at Ellison's house when Pyron poured water into an outdoor fish cooker, lit the fire underneath it and went to get the shrimp.

Within minutes he realized both the cooker and the house were on fire.

Efforts to put out the blaze failed and the Ellison's home was destroyed. Both she and Pyron escaped unharmed, as did her dog, but her two cats and two birds died in the blaze.

Ellison filed an insurance claim with State Farm, and the company paid to put her into a temporary rental property and to repair the damage.

Damage to the house was total, but Ellison's insurance company, State Farm, had put her in temporary accommodation and paid to repair the damage. After several months she was able to move back in

After several months she was able to move back into her home.

But a year later the letter arrived in the mail specifically naming her as the plaintiff and Pyron as the defendant in the legal action.

Neither of them could believe it, and Ellison wondered who was signing her name.

It turned out that suit had been filed by State Farm in Ellison's name in a legal process known as 'subrogation', where insurers seek reimbursement when they believe someone else is at fault and should pay for damages.

In this case, State Farm accused Pyron of leaving the fryer unattended.

Pyron had his own insurance at the time through Farmers, which is providing his attorney free of charge to fight the case.

The policy he had at the time covers him up to $300,000 – more than enough to cover the claim.

While filed in their names, the lawsuit is actually between the two insurance companies and not Ellison and Pyron. Neither company wants to actually foot the bill for the damage.

On paper the lawsuit names Ellison and Pyron as the plaintiff and defendant, but in reality it is their respective insurance companies fighting over which should pay the damages

'When is it going to end? What's it going to cost me? Will I live long enough to see it?' said Pyron (right)

While in the end Pyron probably won't have to pay for the damages, and Ellison technically won't receive a penny, both of them feel anxious to be caught in the middle.

'It's a mess,' Ellison said.

They worry constantly about the lawsuit, which has been delayed five times since it was filed in May 2013 in Tarrant County District Court.

'When is it going to end? What's it going to cost me? Will I live long enough to see it?' said Pyron.

State Farm declined to comment on the case, but Farmers released a statement: 'We are working diligently to secure all the relevant information necessary to properly defend our customer and hope to resolve this matter soon.'

Worse than the stress of the lawsuit, Ellison's homeowner's insurance rocketed to $1,000 per month from $1,200 per year. Not being able to afford the higher rate she is forced to go without coverage.
