First, some parts of the Northeast got snow earlier this week. Now, a second wave of the flu is hitting the region.

The bad news comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday reported that the flu was widespread in six states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island 

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the flu season started in December and peaked in the middle of January. Most of the illnesses during the first wave were caused by the H1N1 swine flu.

A late wave of the flu is hitting six states in the Northeast, the CDC reported on Friday

A close-up of the flu virus. The latest wave of the flu is a strain known as Influenza B, which is different from the first wave this season, which was called by the H1N1 strain

But the new strain is known as Influenza B.

'Looking at New Jersey, what’s striking is it’s much more widespread 
there than we’re seeing in other states, Jason McDonald, a 
spokesman for the CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and 
Respiratory Diseases, told the Star-Ledger.

The flu is not just hitting the Northeast hard. On Thursday, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services that the number of flu related death for the 2013-14 season reached 100 — an all-time high — after two more deaths were reported this week.The previous record was the 2009-10 season when 91 people died from the flu, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.
