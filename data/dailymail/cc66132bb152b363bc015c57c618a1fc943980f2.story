An armed couple who stormed a business in Michigan wielding guns were forced to flee when a member of staff pulled out a semi-automatic rifle.

According to police, the pair entered the tax preparation business brandishing their firearms but little did they know the security guard was carrying an AR-15.

After sudden panic, the guard ran at the attackers and let off two shots resulting in the terrified duo running out of the premises before they could harm anyone.

The gunfight was caught on surveillance video and has once again sparked the debate on gun ownership in the U.S. during Barack Obama's presidency.

Mr Obama faces resistance from the gun lobby in the U.S., where the number of firearms held by civilians is estimated at 270million.

People believe they should be allowed to own a gun for protection.

But thousands support Mr Obama's call for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines as well as for universal background checks for gun sales.

They also want lawmakers to require gun safety training for all buyers of firearms.

Gun expert John Lott, author of At the Brink, told Fox News: 'There is a lot of debate about guns and the legacy Obama will leave us with.

'Not only the damage he is doing to the economy but unfortunately the damage he does to people's ability to defend themselves.'

Mr Lott went to the University of Chicago and knew Mr Obama when he was a student there.

He recalled bumping into the President about 20 times and claimed he once said people should not be allowed to own guns.  

Mr Lott said: 'We are having a lot of damage done to the economy. We have huge increases in government spending.

'He thinks he is a true believe. He really believes in left wing types of things. His goal is to change the U.S.'
