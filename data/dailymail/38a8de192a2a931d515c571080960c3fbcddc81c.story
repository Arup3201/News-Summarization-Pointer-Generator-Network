A chef who was knifed in the back by his girlfriend while he was sleeping proposed to her in court through her barrister.

Gregory Todd, 48, bought a diamond ring to the courtroom as Tiffany Baillie, 32, admitted carrying out the attack on him.

He almost died after she plunged a 12-inch kitchen knife into him and had to undergo emergency surgery.

Proposal: Gregory Todd has forgiven his partner for plunging a knife into his back as he slept - and yesterday wanted to give her this ring as she appeared at Hull Crown Court

But Grogory says he has forgiven his partner and now wants to marry her.

Baillie was remanded in custody at Hull Crown Court after her barrister said Todd had brought a ring to court and wanted to propose.

Now the chef must wait until Wednesday to find out if she will say yes.

Mr Todd insists his partner carried out the attack as he slept in their flat in Hessle, Humberside, because she had lost two babies.

She could face up to 12-years behind bars when she is sentenced next week.

Speaking outside court, Mr Todd said: 'I love her I want to marry her. She 
didn't know I was going to propose today but I was.

'I wanted to give her 
the ring but they won't allow it in prison. I hoped she would get a 
suspended sentence, so I could propose today.

'She had a miscarriage and lost our baby two weeks before this 
happened and it was the anniversary of the day she lost her son Lucas 
who was 10 weeks old. We were both upset. Now I just want her home.'

Mr Todd is not yet well enough to return to work.

The Honorary Recorder of Hull and the East Riding, Judge Michael Mettyear, said he has a 'difficult decision' to make about how long to jail Baillie for when he sentences her next week.

The court heard she stabbed Gregory, a chef, after the couple had an argument while out on December 4 last year after both had been drinking.

Gregory said it happened close to the anniversary of the death of her ten-week-old son, Lucas, and just weeks after she suffered a miscarriage.

He said: 'This just isn’t like her. She doesn’t need to be locked up, she needs help. There were a lot of signs, which maybe I should have picked up on, but I didn’t.

'If somebody I didn’t know stabbed me in the street, I would want them hung, drawn and quartered.

'But I don’t hold this against her at all. Seeing her in prison is my worst nightmare.'

Baillie wept when her barrister, Paul Genney, revealed Gregory’s plans to propose during her court appearance yesterday.

Gregory, who has made a full recovery, said he visited her in prison after he was released from Castle Hill Hospital.

He said: 'She said she was sorry and asked me to forgive her, which I do, completely.

'I lived with this woman. Before this happened, I was looking forward to eating Christmas dinner together as a family.

'I was planning to propose to her on her birthday, on December 29. Then I was in hospital for Christmas, her birthday and New Year.'

The couple met when they were both working together as chefs at the Lairgate Hotel in Beverley. Baillie and her 12-year-old son later moved into Gregory’s flat.

He said: 'She is perfect for me. We have a lot in common and get on really well. I want her to come out so we can get married and get our lives back.'

Baillie admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Jharna Jobes, prosecuting, said the sentencing range for similar cases is nine to 16 years, with a typical starting point of 12 years.

Mr Genney said: 'What is very unusual is the complainant asking for leniency. Most victims would want you to lock them up and throw away the key.

'He says he wants to marry her and has brought an engagement ring to court.'

Judge Mettyear said: 'This is a very difficult case. The guidelines suggest I should impose a very long sentence, but I have to consider how much weight I can give to the views of your victim.'
