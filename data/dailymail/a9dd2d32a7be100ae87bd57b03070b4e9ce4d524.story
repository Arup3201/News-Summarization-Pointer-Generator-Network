British cyber-police have shut down a virus network which infected millions of computers with malicious software to steal people's passwords and banking information.

The 'malware' was spread by Windows users opening links sent out via phishing emails and social networks, inadvertently downloading a virus onto their computers.

Seven servers located across Europe which used by the criminals to control infected computers were shut down overnight, including one situated in Gosport, Hampshire.

Virus: The Ramnit malware, spread on Microsoft Windows computers, has been brought down by authorities

A total of 3.2million computers have fallen prey to the 'Ramnit' virus over the past three years, 33,000 of which were in the UK.

The operation to bring down the network was led by the National Crime Agency's National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), along with authorities in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands.

A spokesman for the NCA said that the botnet spread malware via seemingly trustworthy links sent out on phishing emails or social networking websites.

He said: 'If users running Windows operating systems clicked on the links, the malware would be installed, infecting the computer.

'Infected computers would then be under the control of criminals, enabling them to access personal or banking information, steal passwords and disable antivirus protection.'

Criminals have used the network to steal money from bank accounts, according to the agency.

Operation: The National Crime Agency led the investigation into the network of infected computers

None of the people responsible for the virus network have been arrested, according to the NSA, but they added that the investigation is still ongoing.

Despite the operation to dismantle the cyber-conspiracy, officials have urged web users to take care over clicking on unfamiliar links which are sent to them.

The Government is offering free software which can detect whether a computer has been infected and remove the virus if necessary.

Authorities were alerted to the threat from Ramnit by Microsoft after the US-based computer giant noticed a spike in virus activity.

Paul Gillen, from the European Cybercrime Centre, said: 'We worked together to shut down the command and control servers for the network in various countries across the European Union. The criminals have lost control of the infrastructure they were using.'

Steve Pye of the NCCU added: 'Through this operation, we are disrupting a cyber crime threat which has left thousands of ordinary computer users in the UK at risk of having their privacy and personal information compromised.

'This malware effectively gives criminals a back door so they can take control of your computer, access your images, passwords or personal data and even use it to circulate further spam messages or launch illegal attacks on other websites.

'As a result of this action, the UK is safer from Ramnit, but it is important that individuals take action now to disinfect their machines, and protect their personal information.'
