Dozens of designer handbags were stolen in  a ramraid on Gucci’s  flagship London store.

A £30,000 limited edition crocodile bag was among the estimated £100,000 haul when thieves smashed their way into the exclusive store.

The three smash-and-grab raiders used a stolen black  Mercedes to ram the store’s security grille and windows on Wednesday evening.

Potentially thousands of pounds worth of goods were taken from the exclusive store in London's Knightbridge area

Thieves drove a car into the front of the shop and made of with a number of expensive items in Knightsbridge, London

The gang escaped in a waiting car 
with around 30 of the designer’s most expensive bags, made of material 
such as python, pony and camel skin. Many of them were showcased last 
month at London Fashion Week.

Yesterday Gucci, whose handbags are 
beloved of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and Kylie Minogue, would
not say what exactly was taken.

An assistant at the store in Sloane Street, Knightsbridge, said the thieves knew exactly what they were looking for.

‘They were very professional, all wearing black balaclavas and in and out in minutes,’ she said.
‘In a flash they were gone. They must have known that we had the bags in
from London Fashion Week because they headed straight for them.

‘They are limited edition bags and 
very, very expensive. They are made out of material like python skin. 
The most expensive bag taken was worth £30,000. I think that was the 
crocodile skin bag.

‘There were loads that are worth over
ten grand each and the least expensive one is worth £2,000. We think it
might be an inside job because they knew exactly what to go for. ’

Debris lined the street yesterday, with the black A class Mercedes still inside the store.

Last nights Gucci's flagship store on Sloane Street was targeted by ram raiders who stole the luxury goods

Among the bags the thieves may have 
stolen were the £2,700 Jackie warm sand python shoulder bag – named 
after former US first lady Jacqueline Onassis – and the £3,510 soft 
stirrup deep red python shoulder bag with brown and ebony suede lining.

Witnesses to the raid told of their 
shock. Tom Wolski, assistant manger at the nearby designer clothing shop
Zagalini, was having a drink with a friend at a pub opposite the Gucci 
store when he heard two loud bangs at around 10pm.

‘We thought there had been a car 
crash,’ he said. ‘We went outside and there was a lot of people milling 
around seeing what was going on.

‘They were in and out of there in 
seconds because we didn’t see them and we were outside pretty quickly. 
Stores around here are likely to be targeted because of the value of the
goods being sold. Even so it is shocking.’

A member of staff at Gucci, who did 
not want to be named, confirmed that the store’s 24-hour security had 
alerted the police. Another shop assistant said the flagship branch, 
which opened 20 years ago, was popular with footballers and their wives.

Chelsea footballer Branislav Ivanovic had been in the store last week, as well as former Middlesbrough player Boudewijn Zenden.

Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez had also come in recently with a woman to buy a handbag.

The shop assistant said: ‘Footballers
come in with their girlfriends to buy stuff for them and for themselves
as well. There are a lot of famous people in here every day.’

Police said no one has been arrested yet.
