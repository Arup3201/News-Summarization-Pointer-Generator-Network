A sip from a can of beer he'd dropped in a river was all it took for this grandfather to catch a mystery bug that made his stomach balloon.

John Macdonald, 60, was on the Brisbane River, in Queensland, Australia, was on a fishing trip in March last year when the 'tinny' slipped out of his hand and into the water.

Without thinking Mr Macdonald picked it up up and carried on drinking from it.

John Macdonald was left in agony with a killer belly condition after he caught a mystery bug taking a sip from a can of beer he dropped in a river

Just a few hours later he was 
violently ill and has since had to endure countless hospital visits and 
operations to try and rid of the large mass growing from his stomach.

Mr Macdonald was
 operated on at his local Caboolture hospital after antibiotics 
prescribed to him failed. Despite the drugs he was given more surgery.

He was transferred to the Royal Brisbane Hospital for a third operation which initially was thought to be a success.

Instead he went into more shock when he woke up with an even larger and more grotesque hernia-like mass on his stomach.

John Macdonald, 60, has had to endure countless hospital visits and operations to try and rid of the large mass growing from his stomach

On
 May 8 this year, John was once again admitted for surgery at the RBH to
 remove the mass, an operation he thought would be his last - but now 
the condition has returned again.

Mr Macdonald is
 now making a worldwide appeal to anyone who can cure his mystery 
illness, the large mass had returned but he said he was told by doctors 
that there was nothing they could do for at least 12 months.

He said: 'They operated and I was left with a flat stomach.

'But not long after when you can see what you had for supper you know something is wrong, that was the day I knew I was in strife. I'm told we have to start the whole process again.

'Clearly the Brisbane River is far more polluted than people think - it was a split second decision on my part - a stupid one - and I have to live with this for the rest of my life.

'I want to tell my story to the world in the hope that someone somewhere might answer my prayers and finally get me well - I'm a good bloke and I want to be around for my kids and my little grandchild so if there's a bloody good doc out there that can help, then give me a holler.'
