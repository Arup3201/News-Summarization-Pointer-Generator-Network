Voters in just a handful of constituencies could determine whether David Cameron or Ed Miliband is prime minister after the most unpredictable general election in decades, polls of marginal seats suggest.

A new analysis of 114 seats surveyed individually by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft suggests there is ‘no consistent pattern’ that will allow pollsters to predict the outcome in May with any confidence.

‘It is possible that a handful of seats could decide whether Her Majesty gives the first shot at forming a government to David Cameron or Ed Miliband. The results in the marginals will matter more than ever,’ the peer said.

David Cameron's chances of staying in Number 10 after the next election rests on just a handful of constituencies

Former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft said the result of the next election would could down to how a number of marginals 'more than ever' before

His findings, based on constituency polls conducted over the last eight months, have turned up a series of surprising results.

Some northern Tory MPs appear to have a better prospect of holding on than some of their southern colleagues, despite the assumption that their party is doing worse in the North.

A number of Liberal Democrats are so far defying the national tide with swings in their favour, while others are headed for defeat.

Some Labour and Conservative seats are vulnerable to Ukip, even though its vote share was only in single figures in them five years ago.

Labour’s chances in May’s election, meanwhile, could be fatally undermined by the surge of the SNP in Scotland, now the subject of more detailed polling commissioned by Lord Ashcroft.

‘The coalition Government, the collapse in national support for the third party, the rise of a fourth, and shifting allegiances in Scotland – combined with the accelerating erosion of tribal loyalties that has continued for three decades or more – have made election predictions a more than usually hazardous business,’ he said.

‘Each survey shows the state of play in a given seat at a given point in time: voters who are so inclined will be able to use the snapshot of their constituency to help them decide where to place their cross.

‘Tactical voters can be better informed than ever before. Voters in Sheffield Hallam, for example, will note that Labour look best placed to unseat Nick Clegg in a constituency that the Lib Dems have traditionally – if not, recently, very closely – contested with the Conservatives.

‘Conservatives in both Dudley North and Great Grimsby will see that although their party came second by less than a thousand votes last time round, Ukip now appear to offer the best chance of unseating Labour.

‘Lib Dems considering Labour in North Cornwall will know their seat is on a knife edge, and that their switch would make a Tory gain more likely.

‘Labour voters in Thanet South who do not wish Nigel Farage to represent them in Parliament will observe, however reluctantly, that to keep him out they will have to vote Conservative.’

David Cameron and Ed Miliband need 326 MPs to form a Commons majority. The Conservatives are currently 23 short. Labour need another 69 MPs to form an overall majority. The two parties key target seats are listed above

The latest national poll by YouGov put Labour and the Conservatives neck and neck, on 33 per cent each. Ukip is on 13 per cent, the Greens on eight and the Lib Dems in a miserable fifth position, with seven per cent.

Ukip’s performance is its worst with YouGov for three months, despite the pollster prompting respondents by naming the party in its options for the first time.

The Eurosceptic party’s standing has been slipping steadily since the summer, according to averages of the main pollsters.
