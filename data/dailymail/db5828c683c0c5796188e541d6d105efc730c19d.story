Nicola Adams plans to use a gift from a six-year-old Scottish schoolgirl to win over any wavering host nation fans at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

England's Olympic gold medallist will wear a tartan bandana into the ring when the women's flyweight boxing competition gets under way on Monday.

The bandana - in the green and blue colours of the Adams clan - was sent to Adams soon after she confirmed her participation in the Games.

Adams told Press Association Sport: 'I've got a bandana made out of Adams tartan that a six-year-old girl Scottish girl sent me in the post.

'I hope I've already done enough to win over the Scottish fans but hopefully if I wear a bit of tartan into the ring it will help even more.'

Adams has no host nation rivals in the flyweight division as she starts a strong favourite to create more history as the first female Commonwealth Games boxing gold medallist.

But the 31-year-old finds herself in the unusual position of having something to prove after suffering her first defeat in two years at the European Championships in Bucharest in June.

Victorious: Adams celebrates her gold after beating Cancan Ren at the 2012 Olympic Games in London

Adams' points loss to Bulgaria's Stoyka Petrova ended a run that had started after her 2011 world final defeat and hit a high point when she sailed to victory over China's Cancan Ren in London.

Adams said: 'I had been suffering with a shoulder injury and I wasn't feeling 100 per cent but I thought it was worth the risk.

'I still thought I had done enough to win the fight but the judges thought otherwise and I have got to fight back and do it again.

'In boxing you get champions who have one loss then you never see them again. My heroes Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard came back from defeats even better and it just shows the character of a great champion.'
