Social worker Diane Onyango is accused of failing to raise the alarm immediately after learning a 12-year-old girl may have been abused

A social worker failed to raise the alarm when she was warned a 12-year-old girl had been claiming she had sex with her mother’s boyfriend, a hearing was told.

Diane Onyango was contacted by the girl’s school after she was heard discussing her alleged abuse with her friend and exhibiting sexual behaviour, the Health Care Professions Council heard.

Onyango, who was employed by Haringey Council, north London, reportedly knew the youngster, referred to as Child B, was registered as a child in need with social services but failed to alert anyone.

Lisa Blundell, a manager at the time, said that Onyango should have contacted a manager as a matter of urgency.

‘School had passed information to us on the phone that should have raised absolute alarm bells,’ she said.

Miss Blundell said Onyango did not raise the school’s concerns for almost a week.

Onyango allowed child B’s mother to have telephone contact with her daughter and told her of the sexual abuse allegations, failing to recognise that the mother may have been complicit in the abuse.

In a second case involving a two-year-old child who may have been at risk of abuse, Onyango failed to visit the home every two weeks, it was said.

The child lived in a home where there had been domestic violence and had suffered a fractured arm.

On 29 June 2010, the mother of the child was reported to have a large bruise on her arm but Onyango failed to follow this up with managers.

Onyango was employed at Haringey Council between 20 October 2008 and 14 December 2011.

She admits many of the allegations made against her but denies having failed to inform her manager immediately. 

If she is found guilty of misconduct, she could be struck off.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
