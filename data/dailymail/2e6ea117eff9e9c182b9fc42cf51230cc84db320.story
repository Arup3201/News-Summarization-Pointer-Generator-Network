Sir Bobby Charlton maintains that Manchester United have definitely picked the right man in David Moyes, despite the club's turbulent campaign.

United have struggled so far this season - with Moyes under intense pressure from some quarters - and go into Tuesday's derby with City as underdogs at home for the first time in their history.

But while Charlton concedes the club have played 'really, really badly' this year, he rejects the suggestion that it's time for a change at the top.

'It doesn't mean we are going to change everything. I'm absolutely certain that we picked the right man,' Charlton told the BBC.

United host their rivals as they try to close the gap between themselves and the top four.

They are currently 11 points adrift of Arsenal in the final Champions League spot and there has been an acceptance for a number of weeks that they won't be among Europe's elite unless they win the competition.

Things are beginning to look up, however.

They overturned a two-goal deficit against Olympiacos in the last-16 a week ago and were inspired by stand-in skipper Wayne Rooney during the 2-0 win against West Ham on Saturday.

Now, Charlton says, it's time to settles scores with City after the 4-1 demolition at the Etihad Stadium in September.

'We are trying our best to make sure that we can beat them,' said Charlton.

'If we can, it will be a tremendous stride because we've had a bit of criticism leading up to this, but I never doubt Manchester United.'
