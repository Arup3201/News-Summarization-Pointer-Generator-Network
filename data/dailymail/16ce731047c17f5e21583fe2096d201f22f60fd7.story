Cesc Fabregas has dubbed Eden Hazard Chelsea’s very own Lionel Messi and admitted leaving the real thing behind at Barcelona was tough.

Speaking to Radio Cope ahead of Spain’s European Championship qualifier with Slovakia Fabregas said: 'Hazard has that incredible ability to unsettle the opposition. He is the link between midfield and attack for us; he is our Messi because he makes the difference.'

It was Hazard who set Chelsea on their way to a comfortable win over Arsenal at the weekend winning and scoring the penalty. Fabregas added: 'We have a young team but we are very positive about the future.'

Fabregas was closer to Messi than any other player at Barcelona having been reunited with him on signing for the club from Arsenal. 

The two played together in Barcelona youth teams from the age of 13 until he left for North London aged 16. Fabregas admitted leaving Barcelona this time around was harder than the first time.

He said: 'Leaving the second time was much worse. When you leave as a teenager you don’t even imagine being a first team player.

'I would still repeat the experience because it was a dream to play at the Camp Nou. Even though some people don’t want to accept it I left this time with five trophies.'

Fabregas even admits the beginning of the end at Barca comes against Chelsea. He said: 'My first seven months were great. 

'But after we were knocked out of the Champions League by Chelsea I began to be singled out for criticism. From then on I knew I could be whistled at games. But I coped with it.”

Despite it being tough to leave Fabregas said Jose Mourinho made the switch as smooth as possible for him and hinted at two other clubs also being in the running for his signature other than former side Arsenal.

He said: 'It was during the last season that the Chelsea option began to look like the best one for me. [Arsene] Wenger had my position well covered with [Mesut] Ozil, Santi [Cazorla] and [Jack] Wilshere. It was the position he needed least and so I chose Chelsea even though Arsenal had the first option.

'My first meeting with Mourinho was face to face. There was a lot of respect and he convinced me very quickly. We were very honest with each other that everything that had happened [between Barcelona and Real Madrid] was now in the past. 

'My mind was made up talking to him. Of the three options I had in England I told him I that I had made my mind up.'
