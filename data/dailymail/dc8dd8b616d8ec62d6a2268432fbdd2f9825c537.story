A schoolgirl was raped twice outside a nightclub after police spoke to the drunk victim and one of her attackers but failed to intervene, it emerged today.

Two officers approached the teenage girl and one of her rapists, Darren Carr, after they were told there were 'people having sex' in Newcastle city centre in full view of passers-by.

Instead of taking action they told the 17-year-old to go home, but left her with Carr, who has now been jailed for subjecting her to a brutal four-hour ordeal on the street.

The details emerged as Carr, 26, and Edward Fowler, 25, were each sent to prison for seven and a half years for her rape.

Northumbria Police has now launched an investigation - and its chief constable has already been questioned  - after it was alleged officers missed the chance to save the teenager from the rapists' clutches.

A court heard that the girl was thrown out of Digital nightclub for being too drunk and taken by a stranger to an alcove off Times Square in Newcastle, which at the time was packed with drinkers.

She claimed she was raped by this man, but after he pleaded not guilty in court the case against him was dropped.

While she was in the alcove Darren Carr came over and began raping her, asking the man 'if he could have a go on her'. The stranger allegedly said yes, because she 'wasn't his lass'.

At this point, the defence said in court, Carr was approached by the police after a passing witness stopped two PCs to say they had seen people having sex in Times Square.

The officers, Newcastle Crown Court heard, approached the victim while she was  with Carr, spoke to her and left her in the early hours. She went on to be raped by both Carr and Edward Fowler.

The county's Police Commissioner Vera Baird has already spoken with chief constable Sue Sim and has ordered her to provide a full report of the incident, 'including how her officers were involved'.

She added: 'If there are lessons to be learned, I will ensure that action is  taken.'

Ms Baird, the former Labour MP for Redcar, who is now the woman in 
charge of policing in Northumbria, said she started asking questions of 
the force the moment she heard about the attack.

The officer who approached the victim, Ms Baird said, told the teenage girl to  go home.

She said: 'Legally, any female - or male - who is as drunk as 
everyone says  this teenager was hasn't got the capacity to consent to 
sex.

'So officers, who know that a man has just had sex with a woman in the 
street,  should take a great deal of notice of her condition.

'A man has raped her and an intervention is called for.'

Ms Baird added: 'I must add my personal praise for the bravery displayed
by this teenager in working with both the police and CPS to ensure that
these vile rapists were convicted and sent to prison for long periods.'

Northumbria Police have said there was nothing to suggest that the girl was at  risk when they approached her.

A spokeswoman said: 'Earlier in the evening officers on patrol in Newcastle had reason to speak to the young woman and a man in Times Square.

'At this point there were no offences apparent or disclosed to the officers and no signs of distress to the victim.

'We are satisfied that the actions the officers took at the time were appropriate to the circumstances they were presented with.'

The spokeswoman added: 'The victim has shown tremendous bravery and courage in working with police to help secure these convictions.

'Fowler and Carr are vile, dangerous predators and Newcastle is a safer place with these men behind bars.

'We acknowledge that lessons need to be learned and we are keen to work with  the local authority, licensed premises and door staff to ensure the safety of all women socialising in the city.'
