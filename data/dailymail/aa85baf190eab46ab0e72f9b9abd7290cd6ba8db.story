A few months after Randy Lerner bought Aston Villa from Doug Ellis for £62.5million in 2006 the American passed on a message to Graham Taylor requesting a meeting.

With more than 1,000 games under his belt as a manager, including two separate spells at Aston Villa, Taylor appeared to be the ideal sounding board for the club’s new benefactor.

Nearly nine years on, after being left hanging about in a corridor following Villa’s 1-1 draw with Everton on April 2 2007, Taylor is still waiting to make his acquaintance.

Chairman at the time, Doug Ellis, welcomed Taylor back to Villa for a second spell in charge in 2002

‘He sent Paul Faulkner (former chief executive) down to tell me he was busy,’ remembers Taylor of that bizarre incident at the beginning of the American’s tenure.

Taylor is one of the lost generation, the 24 managers who have been on the touchline for more than 1,000 matches.

Those cut adrift include some wise old heads, such as Dave Bassett, Steve Coppell, Graham Turner, Lawrie McMenemy, Neil Warnock, Denis Smith, Jim Smith and Taylor.

They are not young and trendy or fashionable, and they do not talk about the ‘the group’, ‘the philosophy’ or ‘false nines’.

But they do tell it how it is.

Neil Warnock (right) always told it like it his during his time as manager at various clubs

Jim Smith (left) managed Portsmouth and later was Harry Redknapp's No 2 when they won promotion in 2003

Those who have managed 1,000 or more domestic league and cup matches in first-team competition.

Len Ashurst, Ron Atkinson, Dave Bassett, Alan Buckley, Sir Matt Busby, Brian Clough, Steve Coppell, Sir Alex Ferguson, Dario Gradi, Roy Hodgson, Brian Horton, Lennie Lawrence, Lawrie McMenemy, Harry Redknapp, Sir Bobby Robson, Joe Royle, Denis Smith, Jim Smith, Alex Stock, Graham Taylor, Graham Turner, Neil Warnock, Arsene Wenger, Danny Wilson 

It seems such a waste, particularly when men of this experience will have dealt with, or confronted virtually every issue within the game during their managerial careers.

The only two men alive with 1,000 games to their names and still in the technical area as managers are Arsene Wenger and Roy Hodgson.

Sir Alex Ferguson, another member of that elite list of managers, was 71 when he won his last Barclays Premier League title with Manchester United. Sensibly, he has been made a director.

The rest are the forgotten men of English football.

Bassett won seven promotions during his career, but he has not worked in the game in a full-time capacity since he was assistant manager to Dennis Wise at Leeds in 2008.

Coppell, one of the game’s great minds, has been out of work since leaving his position as director of football at League Two strugglers Portsmouth.

At Reading, when he was named League Manager of the Year for the second successive year in 2007, he was tipped to become the England boss. 

Steve Coppell, the former Reading and Crystal Palace boss, is part of the 1,000 club

No doubt Jim Smith would have wished he was on hand to advise former Portsmouth owner Alexandre Gaydamak when he gave a toe-curling interview after swotting up on the history of the city when he bought the club in July 2006.

Even Warnock, with six promotions in the Football League and recently sacked by Crystal Palace, should have something to give back to the game after a 34-year managerial career. 

These guys should act as mentors, leaned on in a professional capacity by young managers making their way in the game, or by some of the cavalier owners who buy English football clubs. 

True, it doesn’t help when knuckleheads like Joe Kinnear make a pig’s ear of things when they are given an unexpected opportunity, as he was when Mike Ashley named him director of football at Newcastle. Kinnear gives the others a bad name.

Generally it is a young man’s game, but it does seem odd that 13 of the men on that 23-strong list (Sir Matt Busby, Sir Bobby Robson, Alex Stock and Brian Clough OBE are sadly no longer with us) are out of gainful employment.

There are others short of 1,000 matches - such as David Pleat or Graeme Souness - who have played in or managed dressing rooms at the highest level. Both articulate their views brilliantly.

The sport is a booming business: Manchester United have 837 full-time employees according to their investor relations literature; Arsenal 548 (according to their 2014 annual report); Tottenham 368 (2013 annual report).

Joe Royle (Everton’s professional development co-ordinator), Lennie Lawrence (assistant manager at Nottingham Forest) and Dario Gradi (Crewe academy) are still in the game.

Royle, 65, puts in the motorway miles monitoring the young players out on loan from Everton’s academy.

Arsene Wenger is one of two managers still working with 1,000 games under his belt

England manager Roy Hodgson is the other still plying his trade in the technical area

Joe Royle, pictured with Everton boss Roberto Martinez, remains a key part of the set-up at Goodison Park

He loves the role, but does not interfere in the work of head coach Roberto Martinez or chairman Bill Kenwright, and will only offer his opinion if it is sought.

As a former Everton player and manager, a blue through and through, he is a valuable member of the team at Goodison Park.

Last weekend Royle was up at Victoria Park to watch young Conor Grant (nephew of former Everton midfielder Tony) score on his debut for Motherwell during their 3-2 defeat by Ross County.

At 65, Royle knows that his days as a manager are probably over, but he has a grounding in the sport that few can match after a lifetime in the game.

Lerner, who is thought to be worth around £1.5bn after a life working with investment banks, knew nothing about football when he bought Villa from Deadly Doug.

Tim Sherwood talks the talk at Aston Villa training... can the new man walk the walk and keep them up?

The American has struggled to get to grips with the English game ever since. He could still learn a thing or two, despite employing a manager who is supremely confident of his own ability.

‘There are a lot of poor, experienced managers,’ reflected Tim Sherwood, who has become the fifth coach of Lerner’s ownership. ‘There are a lot of good ones too. I think it’s over-rated.’

What cannot be in doubt is the value of someone who has vast experience of handling difficult situations at a football club.

Without them, it will be the same old story.
