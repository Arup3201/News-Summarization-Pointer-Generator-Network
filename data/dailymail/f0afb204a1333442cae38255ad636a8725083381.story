Occasional wine drinkers will be saying cheers to a new gadget designed to prevent opened bottles from going off.

The revolutionary device, which goes on sale for £269 today, pierces corks using an ultra-thin needle which wine can then be poured through.

This prevents air getting into the bottle and stops the wine from going off, meaning drinkers can enjoy a glass or two of their favourite tipple without having to polish off the whole lot.

The new Coravin 1000  gadget pierces the cork of a wine bottle without taking it out completely meaning that drinkers can keep a bottle of wine fresh for months

The Coravin 1000, which can be used on all wines apart from sparkling types, replaces the void left by the poured wine with argon, an inert gas that has no effect on taste or smell.

Once the needle is removed the pressure on the cork closes the hole back up, protecting the leftover wine from oxidation. 

Manufacturers of the device say drinkers can still be enjoying wine from the same bottle months after it was first opened.

The only downside is that it takes 25 seconds to pour each glass of wine using the needle.

The drinks gizmo is the product of American entrepreneur and wine enthusiast Greg Lambrecht.

Being the first of its kind the innovative design yields a rather high price tag, going on sale today at Harrods for £269.

Mr Lambrecht, 45, from New York, says that it was his own passion for wine that drove him to create the Coravin.

The cutting edge gadget replaces the void left by the poured wine with argon, an inert gas that has no effect on taste 

'It was inspired by my love of wine and the never-ending discovery in taste and aroma that it provides.

'My dream was to magically pour wine from bottles without ever pulling the cork. The remaining wine could then go back in my cellar, so that I could enjoy it again whenever I wanted.'

Mr Lambrecht is thrilled with the final result but admits that it has been a long time coming, with the device taking him ten years to develop.

'What followed was a decade of development and testing until I had a system that left the cork in place, but still delivered great glasses of wine, indistinguishable from untouched bottles. 

'For the first time, wine enthusiasts are able to enjoy wine by the glass without committing to the whole bottle, enabling you to enjoy your wine glass by glass, weeks or months later,' he added. 

Greg Lambrecht, the inventor says that he believes that the device could be used at home as well as in restaurant and bars 

For Mt Lambrekt his design is a complete necessity and he expects to see it in both domestic and commercial situations.

'The Coravin System is for both consumers at home, as well as businesses such as restaurants, wine shops, wineries and wine bars.'

The American creative  believes that his invention could revolutionise wine tasting: 'The Coravin System allows wine enthusiasts to expand their palates by comparing, contrasting and tasting across multiple bottles at a time.

'Anyone who enjoys wine will be able to get more creative with their food and wine pairings, and be able to enjoy finer wines by the glass at any time,' he said.
