When it comes to having a sense of adventure, there are few cats that can match Millie. Not even wild mountain cats.

For Millie is a domestic feline who just loves scrambling up mountains and boulders in her native Utah with owner Craig Armstrong, who originally wrote about his relationship with Millie on backcountry.com.

The adorable feline was abandoned by her owners when she was just a few days old – but luckily climbing-mad Mr Armstrong adopted her.

Millie soon came to love accompanying him on his hilly adventures and he even bought her a miniature harness.

Now they hit the trails at weekends and camp overnight together, while Mr Armstrong's other cat keeps his girlfriend company at home.

Mr Armstrong, 37, said: ‘I just knew one day I would get a pet and when I did I would take it everywhere with me.

‘Millie is perfect - she's a natural in the mountains. I make sure she is kept on the best quality cat food.

‘Millie is an athlete, she trains hard, and diet is an important part of any athlete's complete routine.’

Millie was taken into a shelter as part of a litter without its mother in 2013 and was moments from being put down as the shelter didn't have the resources to bottle feed them.

But emergency shelter Furburbia took her on and housed her at their ranch where Mr Armstrong went to find an animal companion.

After just four seconds together he knew that Millie was the kitten he wanted to bring home when she climbed on him and curled up round his shoulders.

As soon as she was grown Mr Armstrong took her out to Stansbury island - a vast expanse of hills with no vegetation so she could get over her fear of being in the open and learn to walk alongside him.

Since she completed her training, Millie has been to some of the biggest climbing landmarks in Utah, including Joe's Valley, Moe's Valley and the Ferguson Canyon.

Feeling peaky: Millie 1,000 feet up

In a day Millie and Mr Armstrong can do a six-mile round trip.

They go on trips so often that Mr Armstrong adopted another cat, Evelyn, for his girlfriend Julianne to make up for his absence on the sofa.

When they are roaming through valleys or across plains Millie wanders harness free.If they are heading for a steep peak the plucky cat gets her own harness and is attached to Craig with carabiners and ropes.

Her highest summit so far has been the 'Thousands of Fun' climb - five stages of climbing totalling 1000 feet.

While she normally follows Mr Armstrong wherever he goes without a problem, on the way down from the thousand foot climb, her tail got caught in some of Craig's abseiling equipment and she lost a tuft of hair trying to get out.

And though Craig sometimes has to scramble into caves or onto ledges to bring her down when she gets stuck, Millie is still the best climbing partner Craig's ever had.

Mr Armstrong added: ‘I just start hiking in the morning and she'll run and follow me now.

‘I do free climbing without ropes and then for the really high or steep ascents I harness her up.

‘Cats are idiots sometimes and they will wander away and get lost if you're not careful.

‘Sometimes she gets stuck on a ledge and I have to save her.

‘There have been times when she's fallen and I've had to catch her but now she just loves climbing so much I can't stop her.

‘She has all the qualities a good climbing partner should have. She never complains, no matter how bad it gets!

‘And she always wants to go higher, and she pushes herself hard.

‘But she also knows when to stop. When she's done, she's done. She'll find a cave or climb a tree and won't move until she's rested.

‘And she cuddles me at night inside my sleeping bag and keeps me warm.’
