Most of the England players will be familiar with Spanish official Carlos Velasco Carballo as he refereed all four Premier League teams in the Champions League last season, including the quarter-final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich.Â 

However, Carballo has never refereed an England game, not even a friendly.

The Madrid-based official had a rapid rise to the topÂ  and gained his reputation by being strong and quick with the cards. He officiated at Euro 2012 and this will be his first World Cup finals match.

Man in black: Carlos Velasco Carballo will take charge of England versus Uruguay

There will be no language issues as Carballo has Spanish as his native tongue and is a fluent English speaker.

Perhaps an issue for him could be the brand of refereeing at this tournament, where officials are holding back on showing cards even for mandatory offences. Some Spanish referees have found compromising their style has affected their overall performance.

English trio Howard Webb, Darren Cann and Mike Mullarkey take charge of Colombia v Ivory Coast.
