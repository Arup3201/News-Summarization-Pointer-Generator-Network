New South Wales Blues took out the State Of Origin Series title after they won the first and second games of the competition back-to-back, ending Queensland's eight year winning streak.

Despite this, Queensland took out third and final Origin game for 2014 beating the Blues by 24 points. Blues captain Paul Gallen was awarded captain of the series.

NSW's defence was strong and they held up the Maroons four times over the line in the first half but midway through the game Queensland were already in the lead.

The first points on the board came after Blues' Josh Reynolds was taken down after the kick with a high tackle midway through the first half.

Just before the end of the first half Queensland finally broke through the NSW's incredible defence line after being help up over the line on countless occasions.

Daly Cherry-Evans put in a kick with minutes left on the clock and it was scooped up by Cameron Smith who put it down next to the posts. The try was converted and QLD close the half with a 6-2 lead.

The second half saw tensions running high in the final Origin game for 2014,but NSW lost the strong defence line they built up earlier in the game.

Maroons' Billy Slater scored early in the first half and another nailed conversion by Jonathan Thurston took Queensland's to 10 points.

Josh Dugan scored the Blues first try not long after, with the conversion closing NSW'S trail of Queensland.

Two more converted tries from Queensland quashed any hopes NSW had of a clean sweep in their first Origin win in years, and the final score saw the Maroons at 32, the Blues trailing 24 with just 8 points on the board.
