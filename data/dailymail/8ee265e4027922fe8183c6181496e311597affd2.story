Luis Suarez will be reunited with his former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish on Wednesday as Liverpool’s most famous No 7 hands the Golden Shoe over to the man who wore the shirt for two-and-a-half seasons at Liverpool.

As soon as the afternoon ceremony in Barcelona is over Suarez will return to his rented home in Gava where he lives with his family in the same neighbourhood as coach Luis Enrique and team-mate Javier Mascherano.

He will spend two days playing his usual secondary part in training sessions at Barcelona’s Joan Gamper headquarters knowing that he will not be part of preparations for Saturday’s game against Eibar which he will watch from high in the Nou Camp and then it will finally be over.

The four-month ban issued by FIFA for the bite on Giorgio Chiellini will not be officially over until another six days but on Sunday morning Suarez will take full part in first-team training as Barcelona begin preparation for the trip to Real Madrid on October 25 – a game that he is expected to start.

It will have been 123 days since out of competitive football. 'The first two months were the worst,' he says in reference to the eight weeks he spent unable to train with team-mates or set foot in the Nou Camp.

'I was in a little gym about 10-metre squared with a personal trainer. I had to stay out of the way. I couldn’t be photographed,' he says speaking to FC Barcelona’s in-house media. 'It was tough but I was conscious of the fact that I had to do it for my own good. I had a serious knee injury before the World Cup and only just made it back. All I kept thinking about was that I wanted to be at the same fitness level as my team-mates once I was allowed to start training with them.'

When his ban on all football activity was lifted by the court of arbitration in sport on August 14, work could really begin on his comeback and the gruelling one-on-one training sessions with Barca fitness coach Juanjo Brau could begin in earnest.

Off the pitch he finally moved out of his Liverpool home, vacating the house he took over from Fernando Torres and that now currently awaits its next famous footballing tenant. He moved his family briefly into his his wife’s parents’ house in the Barcelona coastal town of Castelldefels and then to nearby Gava where daughter Delfina was soon enrolled into the same British school as the children of his manager Luis Enrique and team-mate Mascherano.

On the pitch a behind-closed-doors friendly with the B-team was followed by a specially organised match against an Indonesian Under 19 XI in which he scored twice and passed up on the chance to complete his hat-trick from the spot so that the B-team’s pre-designated spot-kick taker could score.

It’s not quite Mario Balotelli asking if he could become Liverpool’s penalty taker when signing his contract at Anfield this summer – Suarez has won the instant respect of his new team-mates by the way he has fitted in patiently waiting for October 25 to come.

After that league comeback he will play his first Champions League game in the Amsterdam ArenA against Ajax, the only side he has represented in the competition so far in his career, and the team he captained aged 22. 'There are a lot of coincidences,' he says. 'Going back after so long is going to be special.'

Fitting in to life in his new home city has been made easier by his in-laws having lived there for the last 11 years. They know Barcelona well as does Suarez's wife Sofia who lived in the Catalan capital until moving to Holland to live with Suarez.

On the training ground Mascherano and Lionel Messi have become drinking buddies for Suarez – all enjoying the traditional bitter green herb Maté sucked from a metal straw and passed between friends. If the connection with Messi is as good on the pitch as it off it then Barcelona’s rivals could have problems.

Real Madrid hope the three take their time to click into place. Suarez looked predictably lacking in match sharpness in a series of three friendlies played for Barça and Uruguay. But he also looked a long way from the "overweight ex-footballer" description given him by the pro-Madrid media. 'They are running scared of the Suarez, Messi, Neymar forward line,' responded the Catalan press to jibes.

Barcelona supporters are hopeful the precedent of last season will mean he makes an instant impact on his return. After serving his 10-game ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic Suarez scored twice in his first match back against Sunderland.

And there is another older precedent: Johan Cruyff also had a delayed debut for Barcelona after signing from Ajax in August 1973 for 120m pesetas (just over half a million pounds). A bureaucratic problem meant the team had already played the first seven fixtures before the paperwork was in order and Cruyff could play in a 4-0 win over Granada. The Dutchman scored twice in his first match.

Now it’s over to Suarez who on Wednesday becomes the fifth winner of the Golden Shoe that Barcelona have signed. Hans Krankl won a European Cup Winners Cup after signing and Hristo Stoitchov, Thierry Henry and Henrik Larsson all won the Champions League with Barca. The bar is set high but that is the way Suarez wants it. The quest for trophies is about to begin.
