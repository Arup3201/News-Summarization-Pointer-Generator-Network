Cardiff City's board will not be in attending the club's Tuesday night trip to Wigan Athletic in protest over the alleged racism shown by their former manager Malky Mackay and Wigan owner Dave Whelan.

The planned absence is a show of support for Bluebirds owner Vincent Tan, who remains upset over the Football Association's handling of the race rows involving Mackay and Whelan.

While Tan did not order his directors to miss the trip to the DW Stadium, board members wanted to show their support for the owner who was labelled a 'chink' in texts sent by Mackay.

Sportsmail's Matt Lawton exclusively broke the story on Mackay's obscene text messages during his time as Cardiff manager, including references to 'chinkys' and comments about Jews and black people. 

After hiring Mackay last November, Whelan added to the problem when he said in an interview that it was 'nothing' to call a Chinese person a 'chink' and that 'Jewish people chase money more than everybody else' - comments that drew a £50,000 FA fine.

He also served a six-week ban from all football-related activity although the FA said it was 'satisfied' that Whelan is 'not a racist'.

Mackay, sacked by Cardiff in December 2013, is still under investigation by the FA for the text messages that he admits sending while at the club although he denies being racist, sexist, homophobic or anti-Semitic.

The Welsh club have been dismayed that the situation has yet to be resolved.

'I had no sympathy for him after what he had done. He is the man responsible for us being relegated,' Tan said in September. 

Wigan declined to comment on the planned boycott.

The Latics are sitting second-bottom of the Championship with 13 points separating them from Tuesday night's visitors.
