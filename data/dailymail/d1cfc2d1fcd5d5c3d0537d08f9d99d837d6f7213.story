Michele Bachmann has released a family portrait styled like the poster for Downton Abbey.

The former Republican presidential candidate posted the picture of her family on her Twitter account but gave no explanation for why they were dressed in black tie attire or when the photo was taken.

And considering the acclaimed series' fourth season premiered last Sunday, the reference is either five days too late for the first episode or two days too early for the second.

Best guess: Congresswoman Michele Bachmann posted this family portrait on Thursday

The Bachmann's imitation of the Crawley family looks like a fair interpretation but two key components are missing: any staff and a grand manor house in the background.

Instead of taking their unusual portrait in front of their Minnesota home, the politician's family apparently decided that the January temperatures were not befitting the bare arms that the ladies had as a result of their sleeveless gowns.

Mrs Bachmann stands next to her husband Marcus and is flanked by their five children- Lucas, Harrison, Elisa, Caroline, and Sophia.

The eighth person in the photo is Christine Griffin, who is dating Lucas.

Inspiration: A large staff and massive estate were two of the missing parts in the Bachmann's version

Though Mrs Bachmann shared the photo on Twitter yesterday, it was actually her daughter Sophia who posted it originally to her Facebook profile with the caption 'Bachmann Abbey'.

Many commentators praised Sophia's posting, saying that it was 'fantastic' and hilarious, while the comments were much more harsh on Mrs Bachmann's Twitter post.

Some likened it to the promo photos for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, RuPaul's Drag Race, My Strange Addiction, Will & Grace, and American Horror Story.
