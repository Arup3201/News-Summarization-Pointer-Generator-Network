Bandage dresses have never graced the rails of my wardrobe, or the contours of my size 14, post-baby body. For, while the skin-tight dresses are a favourite of svelte celebrities like Victoria Beckham and Paris Hilton, they don't seem to have been designed with the lumps and bumps of ordinary women (or the practicalities of our daily lives) in mind.

Yet now a new bandage dress, which has sparked long waiting lists in the British boutiques which sell it and has reportedly attracted a following from celebrity mothers such as Gwyneth Paltrow, seems to have been designed with mums in mind.

The 'S' dress (the letter stands for 'shape', something I'm certainly keen to reclaim, 21 months after the birth of my son, William) by fashion label Mooi, claims to help its wearer drop a dress size, while being made of machine-washable, crease-resistant material.

Could this be just the thing to take body-conscious mums from playdate to dinner party?

It certainly sounds too good to be true: a designer dress that not only gives you a perfect silhouette, but doesn't require splashing out on dry-cleaning bills. It just peels down over your body and supposedly works its magic.

And, since having William, my wardrobe could certainly do with some sparkle. Embarrassed by my weight gain, I've assumed the shapeless and sombre disguise worn by thousands of new mums all over the country.

During pregnancy, my nausea was only kept under control by Wotsit sandwiches and the promptness of the delivery men at the local Raj Mahal takeaway. As a result, my stomach resembles the sort of thing parents hire for children to bounce on at parties, while my once-pert bottom has dropped a few inches and my boobs have been left somewhat deflated - which after years of dreaming of a smaller cup size is a massive anti-climax.

So being confronted with a rainbow array of super-tight dresses on the brand's website was, frankly, terrifying. Could a 39-year-old mother really wear something spray-on and above the knee?

Appropriate? Can a 39-year-old mother really wear something spray-on and above-the-knee?

Comfort: All of the garments are without zips, buttons or labels - no busting, no straining

I selected four dresses to road test - a bright green, sleeveless dress with a black waistband, a long-sleeved blue, a ruffled black and a tan dress - which all looked beautiful on the website.

Yet, when the parcel arrived, I was utterly horrified.

For, while the manufacturers promise the dresses help make the wearer appear a size smaller, it seemed to be the dresses themselves which looked shockingly tiny.

'Each garment is made with 28 per cent elastane, which creates a slimming effect and the garment appears a size smaller.'

This was certainly true. I gasped in horror when I unpacked the minute dresses, checking and rechecking the labels in case I'd accidentally been given an extra small instead of the large I'd ordered to cover my generous size 14 bottom. Nope, the label said large. No mistake. I'd have to take a deep breath and squeeze myself in head first.

'All garments are without any zips, buttons or labels,' says the blurb. Correct again. There is no danger of busting any zips or straining any button holes, which was a relief.

'The fabric slips around the body, very much like lingerie,' claims the marketing blurb.

Well, I certainly didn't slip into the first one I tried on, a ruffled black number, but instead spent ten minutes furiously wrestling it over my curves. And after some vigorous tugging, the 'lingerie' the dress most resembled? Spanx control knickers.

While I love the shaping underwear, a Spanx-style dress felt a little claustrophobic. This was probably down to the fabric, which had a neoprene feel to it, like a wetsuit.

But the rubbery, tight structure of the dress wasn't necessarily a bad thing, I decided, thinking it could even pass as sexy, in a kinky, Fifty Shades Of Grey sort of  way.

I ventured to the lounge to showcase my new look to my husband, Russell, wondering if it would distract him from Top Gear.

You can be plastered with plasticine and still be ready for cocktail hour

'You look nice, honey,' he commented 
quite enthusiastically. 'That reminds me, I need to get the air pressure
in the tyres checked.'

The next day - after discarding a beige 
version of the dress which drained all the colour from my pale skin - I 
donned a long-sleeved blue version of the dress and took my new look to 
the streets. After all, the garments claim to have been designed to take
you from day to night, season to season.

'It is perfect for all climates,' enthuses model Victoria Fernandez, designer Tom Ford's muse, on the S-Dress website. 'I took it to Colombia, Peru, and now it is my dream dress in Paris.'

But how would it fare going from Sainsbury's to a toddler play date, to my mother-in-law's house for dinner...on a rainy, grey day in England? Well, true to the manufacturer's words, it didn't crease - even when I ended up crouching on the floor, still damp from a recent downpour, to play with a train set with a group of grubby two-year-olds.

And when William decided to decorate me with hummus and Dairy Lea triangles at my in-laws' house, a quick scrub with a damp cloth had me as good as new.

As my final test, I chucked it into the washing machine with the family laundry, at 30 degrees centigrade as advised, and hoped for the best.

I wouldn't normally dare put a £360 designer garment in with football socks or juice-stained pyjamas, but it re-emerged perfect. And, miraculously, the no-ironing promise held up. I let the dress dry on a hanger and the next day it looked pristine.

So, have mums found a bandage dress which can flatter a mummy tummy and survive the sticky fingers of messy toddlers?

The bright colours and flattering cuts certainly add a little va-va-voom while you vacuum, and the wipe-clean material means that you can be rolled on, jumped on and plastered with plasticine and still be ready for cocktail hour in the blink of an eye.

And, most importantly of all? The body-shaping fabric whittles a waist and lifts a bottom that has seen better days, making the wearer look, if not a dress size smaller, then certainly more shapely. Which, for this mum, is worth the hefty price tag.
