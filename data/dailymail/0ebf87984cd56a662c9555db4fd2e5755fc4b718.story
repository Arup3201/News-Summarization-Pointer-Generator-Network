A teenage girl says she became suicidal after hackers broke into her Facebook account and added hundreds of male strangers.

Hannah Buckley, 16, said she was too scared to leave the house after vile messages were sent to her friends by the hacker.

The once confident school girl said she was abused in the street by former friends who believed the taunts had been sent by her.

Hannah, from Basildon, Essex, says she will be scarred for life by the experience.

Hannah Buckley says she contemplated suicide after hackers broke into her Facebook account and sent vile messages to her friends and invited hundreds of men onto her page

The situation became so unbearable for Hannah that her mother put her on suicide watch, fearing she would kill herself.

In August, shortly after she finished secondary school, Hannah was tried to log into her account but it said her password had been changed.

Soon afterwards she was flooded with calls from friends, asking if she was ok.

She said: 'My friends were so confused - they wanted to know why I was saying such horrible things on Facebook. I didn’t know what they were talking about and it was really upsetting.'

Hannah immediately used her friend’s account to log on to Facebook and was devastated when she discovered the faceless hacker had filled her page with horrific posts.

One read: 'I used to cut myself with glass, the things I do for attention... I must say them scars do look lovely'(sic)

In another message, the hacker wrote: 'I only slag of the boys in Basildon because there’s no-one left to f***' (sic).

Hannah's mother, Sally, became so concerned about her daughter's moods she put on her on suicide watch

Hannah said: 'I couldn’t believe anyone would do something so malicious to someone else.

'At the time I wasn’t scared, I was just 
humiliated. I couldn’t bear to think what all my friends on Facebook 
thought about me after seeing all the horrible stuff that had been 
written.'

The cyber bully then began sending abusive messages to her friends, pretending to be Hannah.

One read: 'I hope your diabetes kills you and if you ask me if I sent this, il just deny it and say someone hacked me. (sic)'

The hacker wrote to boys claiming Hannah had their baby or aborted their baby - even though she’d never had a relationship with them.

And the number of friends on Hannah’s page doubled as hundreds of strangers were added to the page - mostly men.

Hannah contacted Facebook and the company sent numerous emails advising her.

However, she said it took her three months to get the account disabled because Hannah believes the hacker deleted the emails from Facebook. 

The hacker has never been identified.

Hannah has since started an animal care course at college but says she has been scarred for life by the experience

Hannah said she tried to reassure friends and family that the account had been hacked but she was still bombarded with abuse.

One person called her ‘evil’, while another said she was ‘a waste of sperm’ and one described her as ‘low life scum.’

She was even abused in the street after her friends persuaded her to go out to cheer herself up.

Hannah said: 'My friends said I was 
being silly but then we bumped in to a group of people that I had known 
at school, I had been friends with them but when they saw me they 
started jeering and hurling abuse at me.

'I went straight home and ran to my room. I wanted to pretend that nothing that had happened, I wanted it all to go away.

'I had heard about girls killing themselves and boys hanging themselves because of things that were said about them on Facebook.

'I understood how they’d felt. I’d been humiliated and made to look like somebody I wasn’t.

'I
thought about suicide, how it would make everything alright and how 
nothing would matter anymore. I didn’t even think anyone would miss me 
because everyone hated me.

'It seemed so pathetic but I didn’t know what do to, how to make it end. I thought about hanging myself or jumping off a bridge - It just seemed like the only way to deal with it.

'I felt so helpless because I couldn’t stop what was happening to me - I couldn’t shut my own page down.

'All I could do was watch while this person wrote more and more nasty messages on my wall.'

She did not leave the house for two 
months after the confrontation and her mother Sally said it was then 
that she put her daughter on suicide watch.

Her mother said: 'I really do think this will be the hardest thing that she’ll ever have to go through in her life.

Her account was disabled after three months but the hacker has not ever been discovered

'I had heard about other kids taking their own lives and I was so worried I made sure we watched her day and night.

'We were determined to get her through it. I told her she didn’t have to do it alone and we’d be there for her no matter what.'

The 46-year-old added: 'I’m so grateful that we managed to support her through it and I would encourage more parents to be available for their kids and aware of this bullying that does happen sites like Facebook.'

Hannah, who has since started an animal care course at college, said she now finds it difficult to trust people and is wary of social media sites.

She said: 'I don’t want to go through it all again. Now I don’t really go on Facebook at all and I think I’ll just leave it alone all together. I won’t touch Twitter or anything else like that.

'I used to be really outgoing and confident - I’d be at the front of the classroom chatting to everyone.'
