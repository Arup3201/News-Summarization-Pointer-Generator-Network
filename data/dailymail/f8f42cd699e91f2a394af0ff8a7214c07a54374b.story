Samsung's next Galaxy smartphone is set for a major screen upgrade that would make it the most high-definition mobile on the market, if leaks are to be believed.

The launch of the successor of the SIII could be just a month away, and rumours of a major upgrade in the specs of Samsung's flagship phone are sweeping the internet.

A document purportedly leaked by a Korean financial services firm claims the Galaxy SIV will boast a 5in 1920x1080 display, quad-core processor and run 2GB of RAM.

That document, details of which were revealed by a report in TechRadar, also claims that the phone will run the latest version of Android Jelly Bean and will be released as soon as March.

Other reports claim that the processor will in fact be an ARM-based Qualcomm model equipped with no less than eight cores and running at 2GHz.

As far as cameras go, it is thought 
that the Galaxy SIV will feature a rather standard 2MP front-facing CCD 
and a high definition 13MP rear-facing one capable of 
shooting HD video in 1080p at 30 frames per second.

Might it look like this? It is more than a month since this picture which purported to show the next Galaxy S phone emerged. Commentators were quick to dismiss it as a fake

As rumours emerged that Apple is developing an iWatch to go with its iPhone, it was almost inevitable that claims would surface that Samsung is considering the same thing.

Reports suggest the South Korean smartphone maker is considering a similar device as part of a secret initiative known as 'Project J'.

The project is believed to include three devices, one of which is the Galaxy SIV, another the SIV mini, and a third which might be wearable.

A report in SamMobile purported to reveal the details, expanded on by Slashgear with speculation that it could be a watch or a fitness device like the Nike Fuelband.

'Some of the same arguments we’ve made in favour of an Apple iWatch hold, to an extent, true for Samsung’s potential "Galaxy Watch",' wrote Slashgear reporter Chris Davies.

The report included pictures of a concept device conceived of in 2009 by Johan Loekito in association with Samsung Design America which showed how such a device might look.

Mr Davies added: 'With estimates that the wearables market will surge by 2017, Samsung’s involvement in the segment is probably unavoidable.

'That health-tracking gadgets are expected to lead that surge, and that Samsung already has its S Health service up and running, only makes it all the more likely that fitness and activity monitoring will be its initial foothold.'

A report in Technorati claims that production will begin in March for an expected April release date - roughly a year since Samsung released the SIII, its current state of the art phone.

Similar claims for the new device were repeated by mobile phone site SamMobile, which added that the phone would also feature a Mali-T678 (eight-core) graphics processing unit.

It is more than a month since pictures which purported to show the next Galaxy S phone last emerged.

They showed a gadget with a new design which, like Motorola's Razr i Android phone, almost entirely dispensed with buttons.

However the image, first published by SamMobile, was almost immediately dismissed as a fake by rival tech blogs.

'It would be easy to enlarge the screen on a SGS3 press image using Photoshop, remove the home button and slightly reduce the size of the Samsung logo at the top,' said gadget site Pocket Lint at the time.

'Also, Samsung generally has more tricks up its sleeve than simply copying the same design year-on-year.'

The expected release of the Galaxy S IV comes as Samsung are locked in a global battle for smartphone supremacy with arch-rival Apple, maker of the iPhone.

The Silicon Valley firm are said to have been preparing several new versions of its iconic smartphone this year, including a cheaper, plastic-bodied model aimed at customers in emerging markets.

Last week Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared to suggest that a less expensive version of their covetable but pricey gadgets might be in the pipeline.

'We are making moves to make things more affordable,' he said at the Goldman Sachs technology and internet conference in San Francisco.

The revelation came after Mr Cook said that he saw a 'wide open field' because Apple's iPhone was currently 'only available to 50 per cent of [mobile phone] subscribers in the world'.

The need for the company to diversify its offerings was underlined last month by a report which showed that the iPhone is losing its appeal among well-heeled Asian customers.
