There were parrots, princes and potential princesses lining the Sydney Harbour foreshore on Thursday afternoon as thousands huddled in the shadow of the Opera House for a glimpse of the most popular royal couple in decades.

Sunny skies greeted their arrival as a flashing motorcade wound its way down Sydney's Macquarie Street and to a glistening Sydney Harbour. A widely-grinning Kate wore a bright yellow number. William seemed delighted by the sunshine, saying: 'I should have brought my sunglasses.' Prince George rested up with his nanny.

As the couple, minus their bouncing bub, peeled through the crowd, screams erupted willing Kate to turn around for a picture. William touched Kate's hand, ushering his wife to give a wave. She obliged and the cheers were deafening.

Touchdown: William, Catherine and baby Prince George touch down in Australia as a family for the first time

Jubilant: Thousands greeted the royal family in front of the Sydney opera House on Thursday

Young supporter: Lola Williams hid behind a sign made by her grandmother which she hoped would capture the Royals' attention

Their rockstar-like welcome came amid news that support for the monarchy in Australia is at an all-time high, with only 42 per cent surveyed in favour of a republic.

Chrisavye Magdas , 17, was waiting eagerly with six of her family members at the bottom of the Opera House steps. She said she loves Kate 'because she's a princess and she's patron for a lot of hospices and I visit a lot of hospitals - and she's good with kids.'

She later gave the the duchess a 'special gift' for Prince George - an Easter candle made by her family in Greek Orthodox style from beeswax taken from a mountain monastery outside Sydney and inscribed with the words 'Christ is risen'.

Among the thousands of cheering locals, interstate and international travellers was was Pierre and his pet parrot Caesar.

The Sydneysider hoped his colourful, and appropriately named, bird would attract the attention of the royals when they made their much-anticipated walk through the crowd.

'He'll be making history today,' Pierre told MailOnline.

'The first time a Roman emperor's met a future king...They're bound to walk over to me with a bird on my shoulder.'

An uncharacteristically silent Caesar refused to say 'hello' for MailOnline when prompted by his owner.

'He misses his girlfriend Cleopatra,' said Pierre.

'I thought too many princesses in one place might be too much.'

Colourful fan: 'Caesar' the parrot was so nervous to meet the royals he couldn't speak

Welcome to Sydney! William and Kate took in stunning Sydney Harbour shortly after landing in Australia

Lorraine Gough, originally from Lymm in Cheshire, flocked to Sydney Harbour with her granddaughter Lola, a commoner 'twin' of Prince George who was also born on July 22 last year.

Ms Gough, who waited in the crowd for almost four hours hoped the royal couple noticed her elaborate sign which read 'I was born on the same day as Prince George'.

But despite sharing the young prince's royal birthday, Lola Grace Williams was 'not behaving like a princess'.

'It's a long wait in the sun,' Ms Gough said,

'But it's worth it.'

Lookalike: Some found more enjoyment on Sydney Harbour itself...

Deafening: The moment Kate obliged a delirious crowd pleading for a royal wave

New South Wales State of Origin coach Laurie Daley revealed he planned to use his brush with royalty to bring some much-needed luck to the Blues.

The rugby league legend arrived at the Sydney Opera House early in the afternoon and told MailOnline he hoped to convert young Prince George to his struggling side early.

'I'm really excited, I think everyone is really excited,' he said.

'They've got a great rapport with the nation and the people. I also met Prince Charles so I'll be able to say I've met three generations now...I just can't wait to say G'day.'

Asked if he hoped to get along better with William and George than Queensland great Wally 'The King' Lewis, Mr Daley laughed:

'We never had much luck against the King's teams...hopefully I can have a chat with Wills and a bit of luck will rub off on us.'

Sienna Hansen, 8, of  Greystanes in Sydney's west wore a special hat with a fascinator she bought at the Easter show to meet the Duchess.

With her parents Annette and Peter she arrived at the Opera House hours before the royals arrived to get in position at the front of the barrier.

Armed with a special bunch of flowers to attract the Duchess' attention, Sienna said she wanted to say 'Hi Princess Kate, welcome to Australia' and that she wouldn't mind marrying Prince George - his age difference was not a problem.

Norma Frost, 75, travelled more than two hours from Wollongong - on the New South Wales south coast - to meet her second and third generation of the royal family.

Three icons: Kate and Wills were massive hits with the Sydney Opera House crowd

She remembers vividly the moment in 1977 she met Queen Elizabeth II, even swapping small-talk with the sovereign.

'I actually spoke to her over in Darling Harbour, I couldn't believe how petite she was,' Mrs Frost said.

'She wanted to know what it was like in Wollongong, how far away it was, she was lovely.'

This time around it was the tiny future monarch who inspired Mrs Frost's trip north.

'I want to ask them about how the trip's been and thank them for coming, especially with Prince George being so young,' she said.

'He's so gorgeous and adorable...I'm a big fan.'

Security was tight at the Sydney Opera House, where police and sniffer dogs performed sweeps of camera equipment.

True love: Support for the monarchy in Australia is at an all-time high, according to a recent survey

One woman had a special reason to see the royals - Marie Gutteridge believes that her four-week-old daughter Scarlett is destined to be the next royal bride.

'She's a lady-in-waiting,' said Marie.

Marie was born in the Royal Berkshire Hospital, the same hospital that the Duchess of Cambridge was born in, though Scarlett was born in Australia.

'You've got to wake up now, to see your future husband,' Marie cooed to her sleepy baby, as the cars approached.

Scarlett did not seem to pay much attention to the approaching motorcade, but would have been disappointed if she had, as Prince George did not attend the event, staying with his nanny.

Manic: Thousands of people clamber for a photo of the most popular royal couple in decades

The Duchess confirmed her status as 'queen of hearts' by spending most of her time on the Opera House forecourt with people in the special area for those with disabilities and health problems.

Nina Kiwarkis, a heart-lung patient at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital said she told the Duchess that she brought joy to many people and asked her to pray for the sick.

'She said she would,' Ms Kiwarkis said.

All ages: Fans of the royals in front of the Sydney Opera House included babies, the elderly and everyone in between

Many traveled thousands of kilometres to meet the massively-popular young family.

'We were right there, she looked right at me,' Las Vegas native Diana Hale yelled at MailOnline.

'Oh my God it was like it was the Beatles. My name is Diana like Wills' mum and my husband always says it's about right because I'm such a princess.'

Not everyone was satisfied with the couple's initial brisk drive through the crowd, with one middle-aged woman exclaiming: 'what a waste of time, I could have baked today.'

Sydney knew it. The royals were in town.

What a trip: Tammy Vandjik and Diana, Shannon and Sean Hale said the royal couple 'looked right at them'
