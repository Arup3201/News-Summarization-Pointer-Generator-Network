The Brooklyn-based photographer who skyrocketed to fame after his well-timed picture of a couple getting in one last kiss before he was hauled off to court may not be getting the credit he deserves.

Self-trained street photographer Mo Gelber, who snapped lovebirds Alexis Creque and Russell Murphy outside Manhattan Criminal Court last month, wants to enter his spectacular photograph in a prestigious competition, but there’s one problem.

Neither Ms Creque nor Mr Murphy wish to give their consent, but Canon’s ‘Project Imagina10n’ required it.

They found love in a hopeless place: Alexis Creque, 28, leans in to kiss her boyfriend, Russell Murphy, in this perfectly 
timed snapshot after they were arrested

Race against the clock: Street photographer Mo Gelber's photo was disqualified after he didn't get the required consent forms

Mr Gelber told MailOnline today that he only had until 5pm tonight to obtain the love-struck 
couple’s consent, but now since the time has passed, his photograph is out of the running.

'I have not heard back from Alexis, and she turned off her Facebook page. Maybe she got spooked,' he said over the phone earlier today.

The young 
woman told him that her boyfriend is expected to get out of jail 
sometime Saturday, and had told Mr Gelber earlier that she would be willing to help only after her boyfriend was released.

Adding to that was a disparaging note
slid to Mr Gelber from under the door of her apartment. According to the New York Post, he note read: 
‘F*** Off.'

He told MailOnline after the 5pm deadline: 'Because of some legal issues, one of the four parties was not comfortable with some of the terms in the release.'

But he is far from bitter. ‘I don’t have any hard feelings toward anybody,' he said. 'The fact that a judge in the competition views my photo a candidate for the finals means a lot to me. Being considered a finalist, I already consider myself a winner.’

Mr Gelber is doing all he can to 
ensure the couple receives due credit, and has promised to share any 
money he makes from the now viral ‘Last Kiss’ photo with them. He then 
quipped: ‘I’ll just tell him don’t use (the money) to buy spray paint.’

Canon’s rules clearly state that if the photo depicts or 
identifies any person other than the photographer, their written consent
must be obtained, which of course means he must obtain consent from the
two NYPD officers in the frame.

One of the police officers has signed a release, but the other, as fate would have it, is on vacation.

Even though the deadline passes without the forms of consent submitted to Canon, Mr Gelber said his mission has been accomplished. 'My ultimate goal of entering the contest was to get recognition as a photojournalist,' he said, noting that the image of the two kissing has spread like wildfire across the internet.

'I’ll go with the flow,' he said, adding: 'I’m mostly being realistic, so it’s fine either way. If I put all my cards, I might be setting myself up for disappoint.'

Who's that girl? Alexis Creque, pictured, 
contacted the photographer to reveal she was the woman in the picture. 
She said she was arrested in Manhattan on August 16 while watching her boyfriend allegedly spraying graffiti outside an exclusive bar

The story of how Mr Gelber, 42, identified the couple is one of fascination.

Ms Creque contacted Mr Gelber through
Facebook to admit she was the blonde-haired woman kissing her 
handcuffed beau, identified in a police report as 26-year-old Russell 
Murphy, as they were hauled to Manhattan Criminal Court last month.

Mr Gelber, who specialises in street 
photography, snapped the well-timed smooch as he was walking past the 
court.

Rules of the road: Canon's Project Imaginat10n requires subjects' consent before the photo is entered

'One of my specialties,' he told MailOnline, 'is candid street photos that capture the rolling emotions of people. Part of it is predicting what people do and anticipating it.'

He happened to be there in hopes of snapping a picture of the 
accused Manhattan Madam, Anna Gristina. He was standing next to dozens of other videographers and photographers, but happened to be looking in the right direction.

The criminal report reveals Creque, who lives just three blocks from where they carried out their alleged crime, was charged with criminal mischief and making graffiti.

Her boyfriend stands accused of criminal mischief, making graffiti, resisting arrest and possession of graffiti instruments.

Whether or not they agree to sign, he said he has printed them copies of the picture, which Ms Creque has already admired.

In her message, 'she said she loved it,' he told MailOnline. 'Maybe they are proud of what they did. Maybe they think they did something artistic. The photograph captures that moment.'

When it came to tracing the lovebirds, he took to social media.

'Help!!!' he wrote on his Facebook page on August 17. 'Does
anyone know who this couple is? It is very important. I took this photo outside Manhattan criminal
court on Thursday August 16th.

'I
entered this photo in a major contest which I am about to win and need 
them to sign a release form. When this photo wins the contest, they will
be in a very big movie with famous actors and directors.'

The competition is bringing together famous faces who will try their hand at film-making for the first time. Further details will be announced during the results next week, Mr Gelber said.

The image is reminiscent of another moment captured in chaos. Last summer in Vancouver, Canada following a disappointing Stanley Cup loss of the Vancouver Canucks, couple Scott Jones and Alex Thomas had a moment of romance amid the riot.

Getty Images photographer Richard Lam captured the two kissing on the ground, surrounded by riot police and softly illuminated by flames from burning cars and trash bins. In the mad attempt to identify Mr Jones following the snap, he was dubbed 'Riot Romeo.'
