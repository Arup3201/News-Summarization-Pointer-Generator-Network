Luxury journey: Lurene Joseph spent more than £8,000 on a single trip to Boston to drum up investments for Leeds council

A council investment chief who spent over £8,000 on a single trip to Boston has been defended by the board, calling it ‘good value for money’.

Leeds council has supported the chief executive of its investment arm, despite recently slashing millions form its budget.

Lurene Joseph, head of Leeds and Partners, spent a total £8,340 on cab fares, flights and nights  at a five star hotel during a trip to secure investments  for Leeds in September last year.

She spent £285 on a cab from the Yorkshire city to her home in Buckinghamshire before flying to Boston where she stayed in the luxury Charles Hotel and ran up a bill of £6,203 for nine nights with a further £1,852 spent on flights.

A further £16,500 was spent on two separate trips in February and April sending delegates to the same city.

Leeds and Partners also spent more than £12,000 sending nine delegates to a four-day commercial property conference in Cannes, where Ms Joseph also stayed in luxury accommodation.

Leeds Council, who are the main funders of Leeds and Partners, has declined to provide the cost of Ms Joseph's hotel bill for the trip to Cannes.

It claimed the five-star stay it was necessary for Ms Joseph as she was ‘leading events and working long days’ and needed to stay close to the main conference area.

The council, which has been slashing millions from its budget, said the trips were aimed at securing investment to Leeds and were 'good value'.

A spokesman said: ‘We do not question the rationale for individual financial transactions but we are confident that the board and executive of Leeds and

Partners are committed to demonstrating financial probity and delivering value for money.’

Leeds and Partners, a private company 
with ownership shared between the council and Leeds Chamber of Commerce,
began operating in October when it succeeded the city’s former 
promotional arm, Marketing Leeds.

Well paid: Ms Joseph is the chief executive of Leeds and Partners, a private firm mainly funded by Leeds council, on a £160,000 a year salary

'Good value': Leeds and Partners also spent more than £12,000 on a trip to Cannes where Ms Joseph also stayed in luxury accommodation

The
council said it was aiming to develop ‘a more national and 
international strategic focus’ and claimed it had already delivered 800 
new jobs to the city.

The nine-night trip to Boston, which ran
from late September to early October last year, was set up to target a North American company to convince them to relocate part of their operation to West Yorkshire during a four-day conference.

According to the company, the remaining time was spent on investor meetings before and after the conference.

It has also emerged that Ms Joseph, who is paid £160,000 a year, is eligible for a seven per cent performance-related bonus.

The council has declined to say whether she received the bonus which would take her pay to £171,200.

Leeds Council and Leeds and Partners have declined to comment on any specific spending identified or to provide a full breakdown of all expenses claimed by Ms Joseph since she took up the role as chief executive.
