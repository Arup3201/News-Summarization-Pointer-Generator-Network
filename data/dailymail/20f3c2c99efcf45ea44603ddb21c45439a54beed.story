Prince Harry's eyes appeared to glisten with tears as he attended a moving open air remembrance service today.

The royal, who is himself a Captain in the Household Cavalry, attended a ceremony at the Field of Remembrance in London's Westminster Abbey.

Wearing full military dress, Harry was greeted by The Dean of Westminster and The Sub-Dean and Rector of St. Margaret’s Church.

He then lay a Cross of Remembrance in front of two wooden crosses from the graves of Unknown British soldiers from the First and Second World Wars. 

As the haunting sounds of the Last Post echoed out around the garden of the ancient place of worship, tears appeared in Harry's eyes.

 The prince, who had twice served in Afghanistan and lost friends in the conflict, then observed a two minutes’ silence.

Following that he visited the plots of poppies, meeting veterans from past and more recent conflicts.

The Prince stopped to chat to Lisa McKinlay, whose husband Lance Corporal Jonathan McKinlay, 32, was shot dead on a patrol in Helmand, Afghanistan, in 2011 whilst serving with 1st Battalion The Rifles. 

Designed by Belgian architect Piet Blanckaert, the garden at Wellington Barracks in central London was inspired by the design of the First World War memorials.

The site carries the insignia of all the seven guards regiments whose members sacrificed their lives on the battlefields.

It features levels of soil designed to replicate the final resting place of fallen soldiers, as well as a central circular bed and an inscription from John McCrae's In Flanders Fields.

It also includes a bench made from Flemish bluestone and trees indigenous to the battlefields. 

Major General Edward Smyth-Osbourne, general officer commanding the Household Division and Headquarters London District, said: ‘The foot guards regiments are made up of Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots Guards, Irish Guards and Welsh Guards and so represent all four nations of the United Kingdom.

‘Taken with the two mounted regiments from the Household Cavalry, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals, they also represent both cavalry and infantry.

‘In the same way that these 70 sandbags of soil represent all the battlefields of Flanders, these seven regiments represent all the British expeditionary forces who gave their lives for our freedom.’

William and his brother Prince Harry were due to hold a royal reception for 300 guests who helped create the memorial to the war dead. 

Mrs McKinlay, 35, had planted a wooden cross with a poppy and a photograph of her husband of 10 months at the front of the Afghanistan war dead section of the Field of Remembrance, one of 100,000 crosses placed there by friends and families of individual servicemen and women who died serving their country.

She said: ‘Harry was saying how nice it was to see the names on all the crosses. He knows about The Rifles and everything they do, and was saying how much support they give to their families.

‘He said you have to strike a balance between spending your time remembering what has happened and moving forward with your job and family.

‘I was a little bit nervous about meeting him but I like attending these events because it is Jon’s name that I am able to remember and I want his name remembered for as long as possible.’

Lance Corporal McKinlay, of Garstang, Lancashire, had a stepdaughter with his wife and a daughter and stepson from a previous relationship.

‘I have planted my cross here today and I was able to show it to Prince Harry, which was really special,’ said Mrs McKinlay. ‘He is lovely and I have a lot of respect for him because he works in the forces.’

The Prince, wearing the No.1 dress uniform of the Blues and Royals with a poppy on his hat band, planted his own wooden cross, with his personal insignia on it, in a large cross made of poppies before the Last Post was sounded by a Bandsman of the Welsh Guards.

Among the war veterans he chatted to was Don Sheppard, 94, who landed on Juno Beach on D-Day in 1944 as a Sapper with the Royal Engineers.

Mr Sheppard, who was representing the Normandy Veterans’ Association, said: ‘The Prince was asking me about our plot and how long it took to do.

‘It’s so important to do this to so that the younger generation can see what we have done.’

Former Warrant Officer Douglas Radcliffe, 91, who completed 21 operations as a Wireless Operator in Wellington Bombers during the Second World War and was representing the Bomber Command Association, joked with Prince Harry about his walking frame, which has a seat built into it.

‘He asked me what it was and I told him I hadn’t nicked it from the supermarket. I also told him I wished he wasn’t so tall because I really had to look up at him.’

Among the current service personnel at the Field, which is now in its 86th year, was Corporal Louise Sheppard-Clayton, 30, of the Army Air Corps, with which the Prince flew Apache helicopters during his second tour of Afghanistan.

She said: ‘I wanted to ask him whether he hopes to come back to us but I didn’t get the chance.

‘He was asking me about the plot and I said it was going to take a long time to put all the crosses out because sadly we have lost so many people since the Corps was formed in 1957.’

The Field of Remembrance, organised each year by the Royal British Legion, began in 1928, when just two crosses were planted, but has grown in popularity over the decades and is now an integral part of the nation’s annual acts of remembrance.

It is the second time that Harry, 30, has visited the Field of Remembrance. His Royal Highness accompanied The Duke of Edinburgh in 2013.  

The first Field of Remembrance was held in the grounds of Westminster Abbey in November 1928. 

That year only two Remembrance Tribute Crosses were planted. But it began a tradition that took root and has grown and grown over the decades.

Each Remembrance Tribute carries a personal message to someone who lost his or her life in the Service of the country.

Joining Harry in taking part in remembrance-themed events in London today was The Queen.

Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Duke of Cambridge, she was joined by the King of the Belgians for the opening of the Flanders Fields Memorial Garden at Wellington Barracks in London.

The garden has been created with soil taken from 70 battlefield cemeteries in Flanders.

The ‘sacred soil’ for the new garden was gathered last year by more than a thousand Belgian and British school children, a handful of whom attended today’s opening event.

The service of dedication was accompanied by music from the Band of the Grenadier Guards and the State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry.

After prayers the Queen and King Philippe laid wreaths in the garden, followed by wreaths laid by representatives of the seven Guards Regiments of the Household Division.

Immediately after the ceremony, the Major General of the Household Division, Major General Edward Smyth-Osbourne, escorted the Royal party into the Guards Chapel where the Queen and the Duke were each given a silver reliquary of soil from the cemeteries.

The garden replaces a pond which was described by Andrew Wallis, the curator of the Guards Museum, as ‘miserable’. As the Duke of Cambridge joked at reception afterwards, ‘no self-respecting duck would be seen on that pond.’

Designed by a Belgian architect, Piet Blanckaert, the garden is inspired by the design of the First World War memorials and carries the insignia of all the seven Guards Regiments which fought on the battlefields of Flanders.

The design of the garden – intended to be a quiet place of reflection and contemplation – includes a central circular bed which holds the sacred soil and is inscribed with the words of John McCrae’s poem: ‘In Flanders Fields’.

The soil was brought to London after an Armistice Day ceremony last year at the Menin Gate in Ypres attended by the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Laurent of Belgium.

A gun carriage of the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery was laden with 70 First World War-style sandbags, each filled with soil from a specific cemetery. The garden also has a bench made from Flemish Bluestone and trees indigenous to the battlefields of Flanders.
