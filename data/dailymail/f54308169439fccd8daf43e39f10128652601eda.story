Their exclusive interview with GQ magazine is their most revealing to date, but One Direction's devoted fans aren't too happy with how their idols have been portrayed.

Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Niall Horan were unveiled as the latest cover stars for the publication this week, with topics discussed in the accompanying interview including bisexual rumours, groupies and their tangled love lives.

And since the publication of the interview, the magazine has experienced a major backlash from dedicated Directioners, who bombarded the GQ Twitter account with a string of often foul-mouthed and abusive messages.

Not so lucky: GQ's Twitter account was subjected to a barrage of abuse thanks to its One Direction cover

Messages from fans range from 
the funny to the terrifying with many specifically complaining about the
way that Harry was portrayed.

Alongside Harry's individual GQ cover was the tagline 'He's up all night to get lucky', with many fans complaining it was an unfair way to describe the 19-year-old singer.

Pointing out Harry's clean-cut side, 
one Twitter user wrote: 'Harry isn't "Up all night to get lucky" he's up
all night making Vines, hanging out with hair stylists, old people, and
a baby'.

'We're not dating': Harry has admitted that he is 'just friends' with Nick Grimshaw, despite being plagued by rumours that they are a couple

Other Directioners weren't quite so 
polite though with another posting an explicit reply to Harry's own 
tweet which promoted the interview: 'IM F*****G P****D AT HOW THEY PORTRAYED YOU, YOU ARE NOT A GOD DAMN MAN W***E, YOU ARE A CUPCAKE. JESUS.'

Another pointed out that the boy's 
fans are notoriously loyal, tweeting: 'I'll f**k you up GQ, I swear 
you've messed with the wrong people'.

The GQ interview saw Harry open up 
about rumours he's bisexual, with the teen star addressing the 
speculation that he and Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw are more than just 
friends.

Reassuring his legions
of female admirers, Harry insisted he 'didn't know' about the rumours, 
adding: 'We’re not dating, no. We’re just friends.'

When asked whether or not he's bisexual, Harry said: 'Bisexual? Me? I don’t think so. I’m pretty sure I’m not.'

But the star seemed magnanimous about 
the circulating stories, saying: 'Some of them are funny. Some of them 
are ridiculous. Some of them are annoying.

'I don’t want to be one of those 
people that complains about the rumours. I never like it when a 
celebrity goes on Twitter and says, “This isn’t true!” It is what it is;
I tend not to do that.'

But
while Harry is single, some of the boys are in relationships, and have 
admitted that being faithful is easy as they don't have time for 
groupies. 

'Groupies? We don’t have time to party! I’m not even single. This sort of talk will get me in trouble,' said Liam Payne.

Even fan favourite Niall Horan, who 
recently dated Zoe Whelan, said: 'We go back on the road straight after a
show and we’re gone. I wish we did have time for girls and parties but 
we don’t.'

But it seems that
a certain British singer has caught his eye, adding: 'I’ll say one 
thing: Ellie Goulding – wow. She’s absolutely amazing looking.'

Louis Tomlinson, 21, who has been with girlfriend Eleanor Calder for nearly two years, claimed that cheating had no appeal:

'The type of girls that would sleep with you in a heartbeat aren’t the type of girls I’d want to take home anyway,' he said.

One Direction have certainly embraced 
their more mature side for the new magazine shoot, looking serious on 
the five different covers.
