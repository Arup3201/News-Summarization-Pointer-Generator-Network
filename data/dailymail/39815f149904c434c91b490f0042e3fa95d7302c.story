These shocking images show the terrifying moment when a family were confronted by knife wielding thugs who stole cash and valuables.

Two thieves, wearing scarves and masks to cover their faces, entered the back garden of the property in Doncaster, South Yorkshire while a 44-year-old man, his wife and three children were innocently enjoying the last few days of summer.

The father immediately confronted the men who threatened his children before forcing the family into the house and making them empty the safe.

Horror: Suspect is seen pointing the knife as he approaches the man who is holding his arm out in defence

Terror: Both suspects with knives are then seen attacking the man while his wife runs towards the children

Before fleeing the property the two callous thugs punched the protective father in the face and got back into the black Audi A5 they arrived in.

It is believed they then left the car before being picked up by a passing white Ford Transit van which dropped them off outside the Sun Inn pub also in Doncaster.

Local businesses in the town have raised a reward of £5,000 for any information that leads to the conviction of those responsible.

Scared: The children and mother then run away and the suspect in black on the left holds out the knife

Frightening: The suspect is seen holding the knife towards the wife and children who are out of view

The robbery took place at the property in Sprotbrough just outside of Doncaster  at around 5.45pm on Friday, September 7. 

Police initially arrested eight men in 
connection with the robbery as part of the investigation and are 
appealing for anyone with any information to please come forward.

Detective Inspector Rich Partridge said: 
'This was a particularly nasty and violent robbery that has had 
devastating effects on the family and has left them extremely shaken and
feeling incredibly vulnerable.

Reward: The black Audi the suspects used. Police are appealing for information and there's a reward

'The family residence was targeted during daylight hours and the threats of violence in the presence of young children, and the possession of weapons, is a cause for great concern.

'I would urge anyone with information regarding the men involved, the Audi or Ford Transit van used in connection with the robbery, or who may have witnessed any suspicious behaviour at the time of the offence or the days leading up to it, to please come forward to assist with the investigation.'
