The series has sold more than 100 million copies, and the film is eagerly awaited, but those wishing to recreate the 'after-dark relationship' of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele are in luck.

A new lingerie range inspired by Fifty Shades Of Grey has been launched in time for Valentine's Day, and has been designed in conjunction with EL James.

The fashion-led Black Label set from Bluebella features caging and harnessing and, as the author describes, is  'luxurious, provocative and elegantly erotic'.

The chic, understated and very kinky collection features triangle bras, chiffon bodies, and cutaway knickers. 

It is inspired by the erotic journey of discovery of the book's lovers Christian and Anastasia, and has been unveiled to FEMAIL three weeks ahead of the movie release on February 13.

The six new pieces reflect the bondage themes of the best-selling books.

E L James said: 'The Fifty Shades of Grey Black Label Collection really captures the essence of Christian and Ana's after-dark relationship - luxurious, provocative and elegantly erotic.' 

Bluebella founder Emily Bendell said: 'This collection was inspired by the deeply erotic journey of discovery between Christian and Ana. 

'Bondage-inspired strap detailing and cut out panelling combine with delicate luxe sheer mesh to create a powerfully provocative look.'  

The chiffon body is erotic and multifunctional, with overt underwire cups and harness-inspired strapping

Prices start at just £12 for the tie-ups and go up to £19 for the brief and thong, £26 for the suspenders, £30 for the bra and £55 for the body.

Bendell added: 'The Fifty Shades Soft Triangle Bra and Brief are deeply sensual yet can be worn beautifully under everyday clothes as a delicious secret just waiting to be discovered.

'The Fifty Shades Black Label Body can be worn as a show stopping one-piece, but also tied in a variety of ways to restrain or contain… let your imagination run wild.'

This new collection is aimed at couples who want to explore Christian and Ana's fantasies at home.

Bluebella was founded by Oxford University graduate Emily Bendell, 32, who left her job editing a legal journal to launch the label which is now one of Britain's fastest growing lingerie brands, sold in Debenhams and Selfridges. 

The trilogy of books by British author EL James tell the story of the relationship between graduate Anastasia and young billionaire Christian, a relationship that grows in sexual intensity as Christian introduces his new partner to the world of submission and dominance that he inhabits.

The series has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide and been translated into 52 languages.

The Fifty Shades Of Grey film, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson as lovers Christian and Ana, premieres in the UK on February 12. 

The fashion-led triangle bra combines the eroticism of the Fifty Shades Of Grey theme while remaining chic and understated. The suspender features architectural strapping,  elasticated straps and four suspender clips
