The stunning locations which provide the backdrop to the smash TV hit Game of Thrones have been revealed.

The American fantasy drama is based on the books of George R.R Martin and is well known for its gory death scenes, complete with violent stabbings and bloodbaths.

But the real-life settings of the lands of ice and fire, are a lot more peaceful and tranquil than in the hit programme.

But to fans of Game of Thrones it will be more recognisable as the Kings Road and the Dark Hedges of Armoy

In Game of Thrones the castle towers are transformed into Winterfell, where the head of House Stark rules over his people

Most of the filming takes place in a studio in Belfast, and elsewhere on location in Northern Ireland, Malta, Croatia, Iceland and Morocco.

The show is now in its fourth season and centres on the struggle for power between a number of families in the mainland of Westeros.

Most of the filming takes place in a studio in Belfast, and elsewhere on location in Northern Ireland, with the Northern Irish economy reportedly seeing a boost thanks to Game of Thrones fans wanting to visit the real-life places where the show is filmed.

From season two onwards, filming moved from Malta to Dubrovnik in Croatia

The move to Dubrovnik to film the King's Landings scenes enabled Game of Thrones producers to film by the sea 

The Minceta Tower and fortification is a UNESCO World Heritage site on the Dalmatian Coast in Dubrovnik

The House of The Undying, the site of the season two finale, was the real-life Minceta Tower

It is thought that several agencies such as the European Economic Development Fund have stumped up millions of pounds to encourage producers to keep filming there.

In the first series the historic stone city of Mdina, provided the back drop for the King's Landings.

However, Maltese officials were said to have complained that protected habitats were damaged, meaning from series two onwards, these scenes were shot in Croatia.  

The Ounila River and the red citadel of Ait-Ben-Haddou in Morocco impressed Game of Thrones producers

It then provided the setting for the fictional city of Yunkai, which featured in the third season of Game of Thrones

Essaouira will be more familiar to viewers as the ancient city of Astapor, which played a vital role in the season three finale

And from series three, film crews also moved to Morocco to film sequences in the fictional cities of Yunkai and Astapor.

The two locations used in the North African country are UNESCO world heritage sites and have seen many other films such as Gladiator and Laurence of Arabia filmed there.

In contrast, Iceland represents the northern-most tip of Westeros, with programme makers preferring the the landscape to anything computer generated.

The opening episode of season four brought in over 8million viewers on HBO in the U.S., while almost one million people tuned in to watch it on Sky Atlantic in the UK. 

For the icy scenes, programme makers favoured the Hverfjall volcano in the Lake Myvatin region of Northern Iceland

It is also recognisable as the Beyond the Wall area, the large area of Westeros in the hit show
