Anyone who has owned a cat knows that they most definitely like to feel in charge, and are quick to show their displeasure.

So it is little wonder that these felines look decidedly unimpressed after their owners clipped and dyed them for a grooming competition.

The world's largest grooming competition, Intergroom, is held every year in New Jersey, USA and features 2,000 of the world's best pet groomers from 23 different countries.

Owners spend weeks meticulously spraying and clipping their cats to perfect their designs, as in the case of this 'Scooby Doo' design

At the end of the three-day show participants are invited to show off their adventurous side in the creative grooming category.

And they didn't disappoint this year with cats being made into lions, birds and dogs, amongst other things.

The eccentric owners spend weeks meticulously spraying and clipping their cats to perfect their designs.

Cat named 'Bird Stalker' has, in a slightly ironic twist, had beautiful patterns of three birds clipped and dyed into its fur

'Martini' the winning cat in the creative grooming category had an intricate floral design on its back, with diamond crystals stuck on for extra sparkle

Professional photographer Paul Nathan, 43, who was at the event taking photos for his upcoming book, Groomed, said: 'They are all professional groomers who take this one opportunity a year to really be creative.

'Most of the work is completed before they arrive at the show as they have to be meticulous and spend weeks dying and snipping their cats.

'There is just so much detail and work involved as not one hair is out of place.

'There was a cat who had been turned into a lion but he didn't manage to look very fierce.'There was also a cat that had been turned into Scooby Doo - which looked good.

Maritni is held by his doting owner who created the design, managing to scoop the top prize from 2,000 of the world's best pet groomers

'I'm not a groomer myself and don't have a cat or a dog, but I just love the effort that goes into these competitions.

'I think the people involved have to be a little eccentric but in the nicest possible way.

'There are some people who may think this is a cruel thing to do, but any cat owned by a professional groomer is going to be fantastically well looked after

'All of the dyes are non-toxic and the cats are obviously well looked after.'

The competition was eventually won by Martini who had a beautiful multi-coloured design on his fur.
