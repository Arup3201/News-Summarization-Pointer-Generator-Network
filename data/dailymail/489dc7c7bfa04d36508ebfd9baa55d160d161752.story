A nine-year-old boy has been forced to take on his late grandfather's outstanding loan by a court in Poland.

Kacper Kownacki was ordered to pay the 18,000 Polish zloty (£3,500) that his grandfather, Leszek, owed when he died.

This is despite the fact he is from an impoverished family - and had nothing to do with the initial loan.

Impoverished: Kacper Kownacki, nine, has been forced to take on his late grandfather's outstanding loan

Debt: He was ordered to pay the 18,000 Polish zloty (£3,500) that his grandfather, Leszek, owed when he died

The bizarre decision was made by Warsaw District Court in Poland's capital.

The court heard that Kacper's grandfather had taken out a loan for 20,0000 zloty (£3,900) seven years ago.

However, after paying off 2,000 zloty (£390), the pensioner died unexpectedly.

In his grandfather's absence, Kacper was sent a letter from the loan provider - telling him he needed to pay the remaining money.

When his family refused to pay the debt, the firm then decided to take Kacper to court.

Astonishingly, judges agreed that the schoolboy must take responsibility for the unpaid loan - despite not being old enough to look after his own money.

Speaking after the hearing, Kacper's mother Ewa said she 'doesn't know what to do'.

'We are poor and do not know what to do next,' said the 34-year-old.
