A surge in support for the Green Party has propelled it into fourth place in the polls, ahead of the Liberal Democrats for the first time in a decade.

The Greens were at a record 8 per cent in the Ashcroft National Poll, up 3 per cent, pushing Nick Clegg’s party into fifth place on 7 per cent.

It is the Green Party’s highest ever rating in the poll, which is commissioned by Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory deputy chairman.

Record support: The Green Party - whose one MP is Caroline Lucas (pictured) - has overtaken the Lib Dems

Growing support for the Greens is also potentially damaging to Ed Miliband, who could lose votes to the party which positions itself to the Left of Labour. Last week, it emerged Labour has appointed justice spokesman Sadiq Khan to lead the fightback.

There are fears within Labour ranks that defections to the Greens could undermine its chances in up to 17 target seats. 

The Green Party calls for full nationalisation of the railways, an end to nuclear power and fracking, and a cap on bankers’ bonuses. 

It supports huge increases in the minimum wage and a wealth tax for the top 1 per cent of earners.

Party leader: The Greens' Natalie Bennett

The party also proposes scrapping tuition fees and stopping the ‘privatisation’ of the NHS. It supports a referendum on membership of the EU, but ideally wants to stay in a ‘vastly reformed’ union.

The Greens have one MP, Caroline Lucas, who won her Brighton seat in 2010. In England and Wales it has 162 councillors and three MEPs.

The Ashcroft poll of the voting intentions of 1,000 people, carried out last week, put Labour in first place on 31 per cent, down one point, and three points ahead of the Tories on 28 per cent.

Ukip was down one point on 18 per cent, while the Lib Dems were down one on 7 per cent behind the Greens. Eight per cent of voters said they would back smaller parties.

The Green Party, whose current leader is Australian-born journalist Natalie Bennett, said it was the first time in a decade it had been ahead of the Lib Dems in a national poll. In the past year the party’s membership has surged 45 per cent to 22,000.

The party has already thumped the Lib Dems once, beating Nick Clegg's party in the European Parliament elections by around 150,000 votes. 

It is considering legal action over a plan to exclude the party’s leader, Natalie Bennett, from the proposed TV debates ahead of the general election – particularly as Ukip will be included.

The party argues Ukip should not be included when the Greens have had an MP for four years, compared to Ukip having won its first seat at the Clacton by-election this month.

The poll also found members of the public were more optimistic about their own economic prospects than those of the whole country. Nearly two thirds said they expected the economy to do well for them over the next year.

That compared to 58 per cent who expect things will go well for the whole country.
