Lance Stephenson's mind games with LeBron James helped the Indiana Pacers fight their way back into the NBA Eastern Conference Finals series with a win in game five.

After trash talking LeBron earlier in the series, Stephenson was at it again on Wednesday night, blowing in the Heat superstar's ear and jumping into their huddle.

His unsettling tactics appeared to work as Indiana stopped the rot with a 93-90 victory to reduce their deficit to 3-2 in the best-of-seven series.

But James said: 'I'm just here to play basketball. All the extra curricular activities, I don't really get into. We only need one more win to get to the Finals and that's my only concern. Whatever Lance wants to do, I don't really care about that.'

Paul George stepped up his game for the Pacers, scoring 31 of his 37 points in the second half, including 21 in the fourth quarter.

Chris Bosh led the Heat scoring with 20 points, but missed a potential go-ahead 3-pointer in the closing seconds.

Indiana turned a 50-41 deficit into a 64-57 lead after three quarters, then led by as many as 11 in the fourth. Miami's last-ditch rally made it 91-90 with 16 seconds to go, but Indiana managed to hold on to force a Game 6.Â

Red hot: Paul George scored 31 of his 37 points in the second half as Indiana fought back into the series

George's 21 fourth-quarter points were the most ever scored in one quarter of a play-off game against Miami. The previous best was 20 by Chicago's Michael Jordan in May 1997.

'We just played. Our backs are against the wall right now so that's all we can do,' George said. 'We were in a position that if we lost this game, we're going home so I think that was in the backs of everybody's minds.

'I felt in rhythm. I had to be aggressive,' George added. 'I tried to come out and be aggressive to start this game off and I was getting looks. I got hot.'
