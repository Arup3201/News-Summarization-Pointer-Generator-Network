Nicklas Bendtner is taking full advantage of his extended summer break.

Having left Arsenal this summer, the Danish striker has posted a photo on Instagram of himself getting, literally, a full-on tan.

Bendtner, protecting his dignity with a white bra, captioned the photo saying: ‘Remember to protect yourself from the sun’.

Bizarre: Bendtner goes to extreme measures to protect himself from the sun

Frustrating: Bendtner's career has stalled somewhat significantly over the last couple of years

The former Arsenal man is dating Julie Zangengerg, and we can only assume Julie is the owner of the bra in question.

Linked with Crystal Palace and Aston Villa this summer, Bendtner scored just twice for Arsenal last season.

He has attracted interest from Eintracht Frankfurt but wants to stay in the Premier League.
