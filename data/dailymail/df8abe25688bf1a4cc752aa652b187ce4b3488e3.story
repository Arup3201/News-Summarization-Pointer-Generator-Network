Cromars in St Andrews, Fife, which opened in September last year, has a specials board that changes daily, depending on the catch of the day.

Family-run Fylde Fish Bar in Southport, Merseyside and traditional fish and chip shop Burton Road Chippy in Lincoln, Lincolnshire were the only restaurants from the northern England to make it into the list.

Papa's Barn in Ditton, Kent, is the only restaurant on the list with an alcohol licence and serves  a £19.95 bottle of Spanish white wine, A20 Albarino Rias Baixas alongside seabass and lemon sole dishes.

Making up the top five is Simpsons Fish & Chips in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, which holds wheat- and gluten-free fish and chip frying days on the last Monday of every month (except December).

To secure a place as a top five finalist, the restaurants had to excel during a rigorous judging process including mystery shopper judging visits.

The restaurants will enter one final round of judging before  20 January 2015, when the overall national winner will be crowned.

The awards are organised by Seafish, an organisation that supports a sustainable future for the UK seafood industry.

'It was a challenging task to whittle down our finalists, so much so that we have shortlisted five restaurants instead of the usual three. 

'The level of dedication and hard work shown by the finalists is admirable. I look forward to seeing who comes out on top at the final.' 

Britain currently spends £1.2bn on fish and chips, which equates to 382 million portions or six servings for every man, woman and child every year. 

The humble British chippy is enjoying a revival as endorsement by celebrity chefs and upmarket restaurants make fish and chips fashionable again.

The number of chippies in the UK had risen to 10,500 by last year, outnumbering both McDonald's (1,200), and KFC (840).

Posh versions of the dish in gastro-pubs and restaurants has added to the affect, along with the current trend for simple and natural food.
