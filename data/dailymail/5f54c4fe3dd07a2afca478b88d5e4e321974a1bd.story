Jann Mardenborough has been released from hospital after the accident in Germany on Saturday that resulted in the death of a spectator and has left the British racing driver 'very distressed'.

Mardenborough was competing in the VLN1 event at the Nurburgring Nordschliefe when his Nissan GT-R NISMO GT3 flipped up in the air as it crested a rise in the circuit.

The car eventually landed on its tail further down the track before bouncing over the catch-fencing into a crowd of people.

Mardenborough is a 23-year-old who is currently competing in the  World Endurance Championship

Mardenborough, the 23-year-old from Cardiff, is renowned for his epic rise into motor racing just four years after winning Nissan's 'gamer-to-racer' project.

In 2011, he won the GT Academy, a scheme run by Nissan and Sony that turns armchair gamers into professional racers.

Over the past few years Mardenborough has competed in sportscars and single-seaters.

Nissan recently confirmed Mardenborough would take part in a full season of the World Endurance Championship, which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

The incident resulted in the death of one fan, with two others injured, whilst a seemingly-unharmed Mardenborough, a 23-year-old from Cardiff, was taken to hospital for routine checks following an initial examination at the circuit medical centre.

An investigation is under way to determine the cause of the crash.

An update statement from Nissan read: 'After the terrible events during yesterday's VLN race, Nissan is pleased to have received information that the two injured spectators have been released from hospital.

'Jann has completed a series of medical tests and has also been released from hospital. Naturally he is very distressed about the outcome of yesterday's accident.

'The vehicle has been impounded by the German authorities and Nissan has offered full co-operation in their investigation.

'Everyone at Nissan would like to again extend their deepest sympathies to the family of the deceased and to the spectators who were hurt.

'Nissan would also like to thank everyone for the support they have shown for the fans involved, the team and for Jann.'
