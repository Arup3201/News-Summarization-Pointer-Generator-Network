Police are on the hunt for a man who went on a random stabbing rampage in Manhattan. 

It all started around 1:20am Wednesday when the man, who police describe as 20-25 years old, heavy-set, approximately 5'8" tall and with a missing tooth, punched a man and then sliced his face while riding on an uptown 4 subway train around Bleeker Street.

The man then got off at Union Square, and the attacks soon continued.
