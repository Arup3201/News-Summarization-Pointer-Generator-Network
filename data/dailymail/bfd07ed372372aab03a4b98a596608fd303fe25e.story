Police have been criticised after issuing an official tweet telling residents to trim their hedges.

Cambridgeshire constabulary sent out the message from their @CambsCops Twitter feed saying: 'Doing a bit of gardening this weekend?Â  Make sure your hedges are neatly trimmed, max 1m at the front and 2m at the back.'

The tweet, which has since been deleted, was branded 'utterly bizarre' by followers.

Mark Williamson wrote: 'Cambs police tweeting advice on trimming hedges - long arm of the lawn?'

Christine Jones added: 'It's a shame they don't feel the same about untidy hedges obstructing all the shared cycle paths round here.'

And another user added: 'This tweet made me choke on my dinner laughing! IF [sic] I choose to trim my hedges they will be whatever flippin' [sic] height I choose!'

A force spokesman defended the message, saying: 'Keeping your hedges trimmed not only makes your property look well maintained, but it also shows that you're there, which could be a deterrent.

'We are reviewing the content of the tweets for future campaigns.'

Reaction: One Twitter user replied to the police saying they would trim their hedges however they liked
