Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, who was arrested earlier this month after claims that he raped one man and sexually assaulted 
another between 2009 and 2013, faces further allegations from a third man

A third man has reportedly come forward with claims that he was sexually assaulted by the House of Commons Deputy Speaker.

Nigel Evans, 55, was arrested on May 4 after claims that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another between 2009 and 2013 - accusations he has branded ‘completely false’.

But he faces renewed pressure after claims emerged that a third man has told police he was also abused by the Deputy Speaker in the House of Commons two years ago.

According to the Sunday Times the victim gave a statement to Lancashire constabulary after hearing about the MP's arrest over two other claims of sexual assault.

A spokesman for Lancashire constabulary told the newspaper: 'We are speaking to a number of people in connection with this investigation, but as this is an ongoing criminal inquiry we will not be providing any further detail or any comment around any further allegations.'

The MP for Ribble Valley read a statement outside his Lancashire home vehemently denying the accusations against him after he was released on bail earlier this month.

The senior Tory spoke of his ‘incredulity’ after being arrested over allegations by two men he had until then ‘regarded as friends’.

Mr Evans, who came out as gay in 2010 after years of gossip, said he had just endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’.

He said: ‘The allegations are completely false and I can’t understand why they have been made, especially as I have continued to socialise with one as recently as last week.

‘I appreciate the way the police have handled this in such a sensitive manner, and I’d like to thank my colleagues, friends and members of the public who have expressed their support and – like me – a sense of incredulity at these events.’

In the days after his arrest, Mr Evans announced that he would step away from the Speaker’s chair for a few days but would return to work the following week.

But the Speaker’s office released a statement earlier this week revealing that, ‘while Mr Evans will remain Deputy Speaker, he will not resume chairing duties while police investigations are ongoing’.

Meanwhile, Mr Evans has refused to comment on rumours that at least one of the complainants was a House of Commons passholder.

He added: ‘I’m very confident that should it come to trial that the full facts will come out and I will be acquitted.’
