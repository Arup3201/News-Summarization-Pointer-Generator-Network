A Michigan man has erected a giant bronze sculture of a hand with its middle finger raised in the direction of his neighbor - who also happens to be his ex-wife.

Alan Markovitz, 59, a Detroit strip-club entrepreneur, erected the 12-foot-high, spot-lit sculpture in the backyard of his lakefront Orchard Lake home.

A person who appears to be the daughter of Markovitz's ex-wife Lea Tuohy tweeted about the sculpture.

'How psychotic do you have to be to buy the house directly next to your ex wife and then put a statue up like that?!?! Real classy alan,' Lenka Tuohy tweeted November 11.

According to the Detroit Free Press, Alan Markovitz moved into the home with his daughter Tiffany.

Markovitz is a well-known character around Detroit.

He began opening strip clubs on Detroit's infamous Eight Mile in the 1980s. Since then, he's been shot twice (once in the face), had a Mob contract out on his life, sued by exotic dancers and, according to Real Detroit Weekly, once had an ex-girlfriend drive her Pontiac Fiero through the front door of one of his clubs.

A self-penned book about his adventures, Topless Prophet: The True Story of America's Most Successful Gentleman's Club Entrepreneur, was published in 2009.

His latest endeavor is am HBO/Cinemax reality show called Topless Prophet, which is slated to air early next year.

Deadline Detroit reports that Markovitz was married for two years to a woman who he says was cheating on him with someone he knew.

She reportedly moved in with the man after she and Markovitz had split up.

'I'm so over her,' Markovitz told Deadline Detroit.

'This is about him. This is about him not being a man.'

When a friend tweeted that Alan's gesture was making him 'look like an idiot,' Tuohy concurred: 'Like lol someone's not over my momma!'

According to Deadline Detroit, the sculpture cost $7,000. But flipping off your ex-wife every single day? For Markovitz, it's priceless.
