Dream job: Brandt Maybury, 31, taste chocolate for a living at Green & Blacks in Westminster, London. The former chef admits he still gorges on chocolate even when his day shift is over

This real life Willy Wonka might have the sweetest job ever – tasting chocolate for a living.

Brandt Maybury, 31, from west London, is paid to eat chocolate.

Just like the eccentric character from Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Mr Maybury experiments with weird and wacky new flavours to make the next Green & Black's chocolate bar.

But even though Mr Maybury can test up to five chocolate bars a day, the self-confessed chocoholic admits he still feasts on the sweet stuff when he gets home.

Mr Maybury – whose favourite Green & Black's flavour is sea salt – is also forced to hit the gym five times a week to shift the extra calories.

He also follows a strict diet to make sure he doesn't put on weight – apart from the extra chocolate.

Mr Maybury, who started work at the company in March 2013, said: 'The most asked question is: 'Do you get sick of chocolate?' and the answer is 'no'.

‘There are days when we are doing a big tasting session for three or four hours and there is a point where you need to stop, because you can’t have any more.

‘But even on those days, I get home and I might have another bar of chocolate.

‘It’s one of those rare foods that no matter how much you eat you shouldn’t get sick of it. We have 19 different flavours in the range and I’m not sick of any of them.’

As taste assistant for the company, Mr Maybury must taste-test every new bar.

In the run-up to Easter, Mr Maybury is busy tasting luxury chocolate eggs and making sure each one is the correct shape and size.

In a normal day, the former chef can either have a little nibble - or can take part in three-hour long tasting sessions.

Like a wine taster, Mr Maybury must be restrained - and hold back from eating the whole lot.

He said: 'My friends and family don’t believe it’s a proper job. But they don’t see the hard work and effort I put in. It takes up a lot of time.

‘I think they are all quite jealous but they’re grateful they get a steady supply of chocolate when I go home.’

Mr Maybury also cooks up new ideas for flavours at the Green & Black’s head office in Westminster, London.

Some of his less successful creations for the company include a tobacco-flavoured treat.

But just like Willy Wonka, Brandt takes pride in his chocolate tasting.

He said: ‘It’s all left up to me to come up with the ideas and to go into the kitchen to see if they work.

Reflecting: Mr Maybury says he has to think carefully about which flavours might work - and says his tobacco-inspired treat wasn't quite a hit

‘I always encourage the rest of the team to get involved. You have to have a good palate to taste chocolate. You need to be able to take your time and describe flavours that you are getting.

‘I think when you are tasting chocolate, having a palate that is sensitive is good, as well as a good nose to get the aromas. That’s equally important.’

Mr Maybury also says he is loyal to his own company - and only sometimes tucks into a Cadbury's Dairy Milk or a tub of Roses.

Real life Wonka: Mr Maybury's job can be compared to the likes of Willy Wonka from Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, who came up with wacky recipes for sweet treats

Brandt began his course to the foodie’s ultimate job when he took his first job as a chef aged 18.

He cooked in various hotels and restaurants, on a yacht in Turkey and at a ski resort in France.

He later moved into product development for supermarkets, where he created new recipes for cakes and other sweet items.

Chocoholic: Mr Maybury says he still loves all 19 of the company's flavours but his favourite is sea salt

To clinch his role at Green & Black's, Mr Maybury sat through rigorous rounds of chocolate taste tests – similar to wine tasting.

But his taste for chocolate meant he beat 3,000 applicants to the job.

He said: 'I’ve always been a foodie and I’m passionate about different cuisines and flavours and making flavours come together.

'I do think it’s the best job in the world. With any creative job, it’s putting that hard work and effort in and seeing that product on the shelf - that’s where the satisfaction comes from.'

Green & Black’s was set up in 1991 by husband and wife Craig Sams and Josephine Fairley.

‘Green’ represents the ethical sourcing of the cocoa beans and ‘Blacks’ reflects the intensity of the chocolate.
