David Cameron has ordered the Tories not to publicly consider anything but outright victory, but privately a plan is being hatched to do a deal with Democratic Unionists

Senior Tories are secretly preparing the ground for a potential power-sharing deal with unionist MPs from Northern Ireland in the event of another hung parliament after next year’s general election.

David Cameron and George Osborne have ordered ministers to say nothing in public to indicate they believe their party is contemplating anything other than outright victory.

But privately, many fear the Conservatives are likely to struggle to assemble a majority, though they are increasingly confident that they can remain the largest party.

If they again fall short of the 326 MPs needed for an outright win, senior Tories suggest the Democratic Unionist MPs from Northern Ireland could hold the balance of power. 

Currently, the party has eight MPs, making it the fourth largest party in Westminster.

Mr Cameron will face a battle with sections of his party if he seeks to enter another coalition with the Liberal Democrats. 

He has promised MPs a formal say, and around 40 Tories are thought to be unlikely to back another deal with Nick Clegg under any circumstances.

Senior Conservatives are now floating either a so-called ‘confidence and supply’ arrangement, which would mean guaranteeing support on votes of confidence in the Government and Budget measures, or a more formal power-sharing agreement with the DUP.

One well-placed source said: ‘The DUP is definitely being wooed. Of course people are thinking about these things.’

A Tory Cabinet minister said a narrow overall victory next year was possible because voters were concluding Ed Miliband is ‘unelectable’, but a second coalition with the Lib Dems was still the most likely outcome.

But behind the scenes there was ‘a lot of cosying up’ to the DUP and there was ‘much talk of them helping keep a minority Tory administration in business’, the minister said.

Last month, in a sign of the efforts being made behind the scenes, the Prime Minister hosted a lavish reception in the Downing Street garden DUP MPs.

The DUP is now said to be already drawing up its demands as the price of supporting the Conservatives in another hung Parliament after next year’s election – likely to include protection from some Government spending cuts.

Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers has already signed an agreement with the Northern Irish Executive on an economic development package.

It raises the prospect of Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP and MP for North Belfast, sitting in a Westminster government

Conservative MP Mel Stride, Parliamentary aide to John Hayes, senior Parliamentary adviser to the Prime Minister, said his party should ‘reach out now’ to the DUP.

He pointed out that when a similar deal was mooted before the 2010 election, the DUP was said to be demanding a commitment to cancel £200 million of cuts to Northern Ireland’s public sector.

‘More sensible terms should follow from a better relationship with some issues scoped out in advance,’ Mr Stride said.

‘Coalition government has taught us the importance of developing and nurturing connections with other political parties.’

He pointed out that the DUP was the only other party that had backed a Conservative commitment to give voters a say on Britain’s membership of the EU.

‘Both Labour and the Lib Dems have explicitly ruled out a referendum on our membership of the EU. It could just be that an alliance with the other political party represented in Westminster that wants to protect our sovereignty will enable us to deliver on our commitment to renegotiate our relationship with the EU, deliver a historic referendum and govern again after May 2015,’ he added.

Around 40 Conservative MPs are reportedly ready to block the idea of a second coalition with Nick Clegg's Lib Dems, if Mr Cameron again falls short of an overall majority

Paul Goodman, editor of the ConservativeHome website, said: ‘Were a 2010-style result to happen, two main options are canvassed – a second coalition, or a minority government.’

But he said there was a third – ‘a confidence and supply arrangement with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists’.

‘The province’s MPs have a history of importance in Parliaments in which the government of the day has a small majority, or none at all. Downing Street is certainly eyeing the DUP with interest,’ he added.

The Ulster Unionists helped to prop up John Major’s government during the 1990s and Jim Callaghan’s in the 1970s.

The prospect of a Tory-DUP deal came as it emerged allies of Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have met to discuss common ground between Labour and the Lib Dems.

The Labour peer Lord Adonis, and Lord Wood, one of Mr Miliband's closest advisers, met Jonny Oates, Mr Clegg's chief of staff and Neil Sherlock, a senior Lib Dem and donor, the BBC’s Newsnight programme reported. The group met for dinner at a London restaurant in April.

There is increasing speculation at Westminster that Labour also fears it will fail to win a majority next year and is contemplating a coalition with the Lib Dems.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable, said to want to be Chancellor in a Lib-Lab government, said yesterday such informal contacts between Lib Dems and Labour were ‘totally sensible’ but not preparations for future coalition.
