'We love each other': Mr Clegg said he and his wife Miriam didn't get married because they were offered £3 a week

Nick Clegg prompted Conservative anger last night as he poured scorn on ‘odd’ proposals for tax breaks for married couples, saying a few pounds  a week would not encourage people  to get hitched.

The Deputy Prime Minister confirmed he would not support Tory plans to recognise marriage in the tax system, insisting: ‘You don’t need the taxman to tell you whether you should get married or not.’

David Cameron is today expected to restate his ‘absolute commitment’ to introducing tax breaks for married couples, while indicating that they are not likely to be unveiled until next year’s Budget.

But his Liberal Democrat deputy, who 
will join Labour in opposing the measure, said yesterday: ‘If you say to
someone, “Oh, wouldn’t it be nice to be given some help to get 
married?”, they’d go, “Oh, that’s a good idea”.

‘But if you think about it a bit more
it would be odd, wouldn’t it, to say people who chose not to get 
married have to pay higher tax.

‘That’s why my party doesn’t support the idea of a transferable tax allowance for  married couples.

‘The more people will look at this, 
the more they will think . . . why should you be giving, whatever it is,
£3 a week to married couples?’

Tory MPs expressed alarm that Mr Clegg was denouncing the idea in such terms, given his party’s commitment to abstain.

Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, said: ‘This is just part of the sneering, liberal view of people that do the right thing.

‘We know Nick Clegg is not very good 
at following the details of the coalition agreement but if he has such a
big problem with this issue, why didn’t they say they would vote 
against?’

Witham MP Priti Patel added: ‘Only 
someone from a privileged background like his could be as dismissive as 
he is of £3 a week. He shows a complete disregard and lack of 
understanding of regular families.’

David Cameron is being urged by some Tory MPs to use the promise to introduce a marriage tax allowance to buy off opponents of gay marriage plans

Nick Clegg used his weekly phone-in to argue against a marriage tax allowance

Tory MPs say the need to introduce 
the marriage tax break is more urgent than ever, given that the 
Government is preparing to unveil support for working women to help pay 
for childcare. A minister admitted the plans could penalise stay-at-home
mothers.

Lord Newby, a Treasury spokesman in the Lords, admitted there could be problems associated with a ‘tax relief-based scheme’.

The Lord Bishop of Chester Peter 
Forster asked Lord Newby whether it would be ‘unfair to introduce this 
tax relief for working parents with children while denying effective tax
relief through transferable allowances to those parents who choose to 
stay at home with young children and who are currently penalised through
the tax system’.

Lord Newby replied: ‘Obviously one of
the problems with simply having a tax relief-based scheme is the one 
that the right reverend prelate refers to. That is why we are looking at
a number of options, some of which are tax based and others of which 
are not.’

Mr Clegg, conducting his weekly radio phone-in on LBC radio, conceded that marriage was ‘incredibly important’.

‘I mean, marriage is the best thing 
that’s ever happened to me, but I tell you, Miriam and I didn’t get 
married because we got offered £3 a week. We got married thankfully 
because we love each other and that’s what most people’s views are about
marriage.’

Culture Secretary Maria Miller, left, has said recognising marriage in the tax system is 'important' while Tory MP for Portsmouth North Penny Mordaunt, right, has challenged ministers on the progress of the policy

Under Mr Cameron’s plans, it is 
expected that one member of a married couple or those in civil 
partnerships would be allowed to transfer £750 of their tax-free 
personal allowance to their partner, reducing their partner’s tax bill. 
This would be worth £150 a year to basic-rate taxpayers.

The coalition agreement struck 
between the Tories and the Lib Dems committed the Government to 
introducing the allowance, but gave the Lib Dems special permission to 
abstain. That means that even with Labour voting against, it should 
still pass into law.

- MORE than a third of working 
mothers want to quit their jobs to look after their children, a major 
government-funded study found yesterday.
The survey, conducted among 6,350 parents for the Department for 
Education, also revealed that rising numbers of mothers are deciding to 
stay at home, either by choice or because of spiralling childcare costs.
The proportion of mothers with full-time or part-time jobs has fallen 
from 63 per cent to 60 per cent in just a year.

Another year; another Nick Clegg attack on proposals to support marriage through the tax system.

The Lib Dem leader first derided the Tory idea in late 2010, saying it was equivalent to taking the ‘1950s model of suit-wearing, bread-winning dad and aproned, home-making mother, and trying to preserve it in aspic’.

But far from being backward-looking, giving tax breaks to married couples would merely bring Britain in line with the rest of Europe – something one might think would appeal to Mr Clegg’s Europhile tendencies.

Under our system, married couples are actually punished financially – with experts estimating that most married couples with children are losing £100 a week compared to single parents who live alone.

Europe is divided into two groups on the issue.

The first offers married couples either transferrable tax allowances that can be swapped between spouses, or tax credits that are shared between a married couple. The countries in this system include Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain.

The second group favours income-splitting, in which the income of the husband and wife is added together then divided into two for tax purposes. If the wife doesn’t work, or works part-time, this can bring a significant reduction in the husband’s tax liability. This system is used in Estonia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal and Switzerland.

Here we look at how marriage is recognised in the tax system of  four EU countries:

FRANCE

Families are taxed as a unit, rather than individually as in the UK. The tax allowances – the amount they can earn without being taxed – refer to the whole family rather than each member. It means a mother who stays at home to look after her children will not lose out because the family’s tax allowance would be the same if she went to work.

GERMANY

Couples can decide to be taxed either individually or jointly. If they decide to pay tax jointly, their tax allowances are doubled – whether or not they are both working.

Child tax credits are doubled if the couple decide to be taxed jointly. It means that a mother who decides to stay at home to look after her children will not lose out.

Married couples also get help with mortgages, cheaper health insurance and get tax relief if they make repairs to their home. And, to encourage young mothers to stay at home, they are paid a child-rearing allowance until the child is two.

ITALY

Italy has a system of individual tax registration, meaning everyone gets the same allowances, regardless of their marital arrangements.

However, marriage is recognised in the system because there are tax credits for spouses – meaning families get something back from the State if they are married or cohabit. It also means that when a mother stays at home to look after her children, the family will not lose out.

SPAIN

The tax allowance for married couples filing jointly is higher than the allowance for unmarried or separated individuals with dependent children. This means there is a cash incentive for those who stay together and agree to be taxed together.
