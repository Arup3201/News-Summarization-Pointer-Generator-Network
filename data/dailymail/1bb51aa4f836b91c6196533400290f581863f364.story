This poodle seems determined to attract the attention of shoppers by dancing on his hind legs.

Filmed at a Chinese market, this YouTube clip has become an internet sensation with thousands of people watching the white poodle jigging around.

The clip starts with the excitable puppy jumping up on its hind legs in front of people walking past the pen.

Dancing poodle: The clip was filmed at a Chinese market where poodles were for sale

As people film the fluffy hound, it hops from one hind leg to another with its front paws in the air.

The other puppies in the same enclosure seem unimpressed by the poodle's dance moves and pay it no attention.

His antics raise a smile from the passing crowds walking between pens of different dogs.Â 

Poodles are well known for being easy to train but their coats need constant grooming and attention.

There are three varieties of the breed, standard, miniature and toy and they are all energetic.

Poodles are one of the most popular dog breeds in the world.
