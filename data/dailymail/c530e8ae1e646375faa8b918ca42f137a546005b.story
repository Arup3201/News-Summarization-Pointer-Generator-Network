Chief constable Andy Trotter, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, denied a growing culture of secrecy

Nearly a third of police forces are keeping secret the names of suspects even after they have been charged.

A survey by the Daily Mail has revealed that 14 out of 43 constabularies in England and Wales will not name individuals when they are formally charged with a crime.

The figures fly in the face of claims from senior officers that the service is ‘more open than ever’.

The survey was carried out after one force, Warwickshire, sparked outrage with a decision to wrap charging decisions in secrecy rules as a result of the Leveson Inquiry.

The force announced the move in a footnote to a press release on Wednesday as it charged a former officer with the theft of £113,000 from police headquarters.

MPs and free speech campaigners described it as an ‘extremely worrying’ precedent.

Yesterday the force carried out an abrupt U-turn and identified the man as Paul Andrew Greaves, 54, from Carlton, Nottinghamshire.

He had already been named by the Crown Prosecution Service.

The senior police officer responsible for tightening the rules on how police interact with the media took to the airwaves to claim Warwickshire had ‘corrected’ its position and insisted ‘people who are charged will be named’.

Chief Constable Andy Trotter, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, denied the case reflected a growing culture of secrecy.

‘We are more open than ever,’ he told Radio 4’s World At One. ‘We engage with the public via the traditional media and social media in a way we’ve never done before.

'What we are trying to encourage is an open and transparent relationship with the media, not one that has been characterised in the past by secret deals and sometimes, unfortunately, corruption, but one which is absolutely transparent.’

But a survey carried out by the Mail yesterday revealed the Acpo guidance is being ignored or defied.

Fourteen forces said they did not name individuals on the day they laid criminal charges. Many said they would not give out a name until the day before the suspect appeared in court.

Even then, many would only give a surname to allow the Press to identify the individual from the court list.

This was the position adopted by Warwickshire on Wednesday night, when it said it would identify the man ahead of his court appearance later this month if journalists called up the day before. Yesterday the force was hit by a torrent of complaints and performed a U-turn.

The force was criticised by its own deputy police and crime commissioner, Eric Wood, who said: ‘The commissioner is demanding a full and frank report on all of the circumstances that led to this decision, and we will be seeking assurances that in future all national guidelines are adhered to.’

On Wednesday night, after the story broke, Deputy Chief Constable Neil Brunton took to Twitter to defend the policy.

He wrote: ‘The policy was recently changed to align with national policy post Leverson (sic) and not because of today’s outcome.’

It follows Lord Justice Leveson’s report 
which called for a ban on the Press and public being told by the police 
when someone has been arrested, except in exceptional circumstances

Yesterday the CPS said it would name anyone charged with a criminal offence on the day the charging decision was made, unless there were ‘exceptional circumstances’.

Mr Trotter is drawing up draconian new rules that would ban forces from naming anyone who has been arrested, even by way of confirming a name a journalist already has.

It follows Lord Justice Leveson’s report which called for a ban on the Press and public being told by the police when someone has been arrested, except in exceptional circumstances. It did not go as far as suggesting the ban should apply to suspects who have been charged.

And the Government’s own legal adviser, the Law Commission, has said police should name the arrested party when journalists request an identity. In its statement, a Warwickshire Police spokesman said: ‘We will be adopting the national Acpo guidance in respect to naming individuals on charge. We apologise that our previous approach has not been consistent with this.’

Kirsty Hughes of Index on Censorship said: ‘That the police should withhold the name of a former officer who has not only been arrested but charged is of concern. In certain cases, it may be appropriate to preserve anonymity but a policy of secrecy reverses the principle of open justice that we have in the UK.’

Last night Greaves, who runs a financial investigation training company, said: ‘I have been told by my solicitor not to say anything about this. The whole thing has been so stressful for me and my family’.
