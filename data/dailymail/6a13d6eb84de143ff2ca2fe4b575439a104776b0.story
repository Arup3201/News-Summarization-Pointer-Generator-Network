The wife of the man who led Britain into the First World War dismissed Winston Churchill as a ‘dangerous maniac’ in her hard-hitting diaries, a new book has revealed.

Margot Asquith was the wife of Herbert Henry Asquith, the Liberal Prime Minister who was ousted from Downing Street during the Great War.

From her vantage point she created a ‘compelling’ record of her husband’s fall from grace – and revealed her disdain for a number of leading figures of the day.

Winston Churchill, pictured centre with General De Gaulle in Paris in 1944, came in for particular criticism in Margot Asquith's 1915 diary entries

At one point, writing in 1915, she says Churchill’s ‘vanity is septic. He would die of blood poisoning if it were not for a great deal of red blood which circulates freely through his heart and stomach.’

She goes on to describe him as a ‘dangerous maniac, so poor in character and judgment, so insolent and childish, I hardly even think him a danger’, the Observer reports.

Her views are revealed in ‘Margot Asquith’s Great War Diary’ by Michael and Eleanor Brock, released later this month.

Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War, also came in for criticism from Margot Asquith, the wife of Herbert Asquith

David Lloyd George, British Prime Minister 1922, was another leading politician to come in for withering scorn in Margot Asquith's diaries

And it is not just Second World War great Winston Churchill who incurs her wrath in the diaries, which stretch from 1914 to 1916.

The man who took over at Downing Street during the Great War, David Lloyd George, comes in for particular criticism when she writes: ‘All he undertakes drops in chaos and confusion on a floor littered with covered tracks.’

Lady Asquith, who once described herself as ‘a sort of political clairvoyant’ also turns her attentions on the secretary of state for war, Lord Kitchener who she slammed as ‘slow and cumbersome in mind’ and 'a man brutal by nature and by pose'.

The diaries chart some of the political battles that lay behind the warfare on the Western Front and charts her own views on the conflict.

'This is the 84th day of the war' she wrote in October 1914, 'and speaking for myself I have never felt the same person since. I don't mean to say I have improved! On the contrary...'.

But she reserved praise for her husband, who was replaced as Prime Minister during the war following a series of military and political crises. She lovingly describes him as 'by far the ablest, wisest, calmest and cleverest man in England'.

Margot Asquith was born Alice Margaret Tennant in Peeblesshire, Tweeddale in 1864 and would go on to become a well known socialite, author and wit.

She was married to Herbert Henry Asquith from 1894 until he died in 1928.

She bore five children, only two of whom survived infancy, Elizabeth, who married Antoine Bibesco of Romania in 1919 and became a writer and Anthony, who became a leading film director.

Margot Asquith's Great War Diary 1914 - 1916, by Michael and Eleanor Brock, is available from June 26, published by Oxford University Press.
