It's the little newsagency that just keeps on giving back.

Over $2.2 million worth of prize money has been won from tickets purchased at the Evatt Newsagency in Canberra in just over six months.

Most recently, the store sold Friday's $1 million dollar winning Lotto ticket to an anonymous victor.

Clearly a case of 'third time lucky', it was the third division one winning ticket to be sold by the store since May. 

The newsagency has been swamped by customer hoping to get lucky since only the second win according to Sateesh, who owns and runs the store alongside his wife.

'I can see a lot of new faces in the shop who come to buy the tickets only here because it's now considered lucky,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

The most recent win of $1 million on Friday was won by one of the store's customers who prefers to remain anonymous 

'New people are coming in every time and a lot of people are also winning small amounts too.

'It is its very exciting and the people who won are having their wishes come true.'

The first lucky customer to win at the store was a man in his 60s whose entry into the Saturday Lotto won him over $687,000 back in May.

The Canberra man, who said he planned to spend some of the money on a holiday, first said: 'are you kidding me? Blimey, I've cracked the big one,' upon being informed of his win, the Canberra Times reports.

Five weeks later, a local father won more than $708,000 from his first division purchase.

Friday's winning numbers, which were also claimed by a Coogee man, were 15, 43, 21, 3, 32 and 17 with the supplementary numbers of 16 and 24.
