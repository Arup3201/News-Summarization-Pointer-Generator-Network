Meet the man dubbed the Lebanese Michael Jackson after a crowd-pleasing and hairy performance at a recent rugby league match in Sydney.

Ashur Shimon, from Fairfield in Sydney's south-west, found himself on the big screen at Sydney's ANZ Stadium on July 4 as his beloved Canterbury Bulldogs took on the Manly Sea Eagles.

He was making his first appearance on the 'dance cam' as part of the game-day entertainment when he decided to fabulously bare his hairy chest, back and arms to the crowd of thousands.

The Bulldogs dance cam, hosted by comedians Rob Shehadie and Tahir from Fat Pizza, picks random people from the crowd and let's them bust a move.

But Mr Shimon's performance was certainly new and unexpected.

'He's a crazy Michael Jackson fan and I've seen him dance before. I know him but I definitely didn't expect him to go the whole way and rip his shirt off,' Shehadie told Daily Mail Australia.

He pulled out a Michael Jackson moon walk before laughing at himself on the big screen.

But when the cameras panned back to him several more times, Mr Shimon started to show what he was really capable of.

He ran up a small flight of stairs throwing his jacket aside, before ripping his shirt to pieces and baring his hairy physique.

'I've hosted a lot of football games but I've never heard a roar like that from the crowd before. It was just massive,' Shehadie said.

'Security actually came up to him and he got in trouble. They thought he was going to streak or something.'

Following his dance cam success, the Bulldogs entertainment crew are trying to get Mr Shimon back for more home games.

'He's starting to become part of the entertainment,' Shehadie said.

As for Mr Shimon's overly hairy appearance - he's very proud

'We got him back for last week's game too and we caught him eating a kebab aggressively on camera. So we told him to shake his coke up and make it spray before we crossed to him. His coke sprayed everywhere and then he started dancing.'

As for Mr Shimon's overly hairy appearance - he's very proud.

'Ashur really thinks people should accept hairy people. His goal in life is to make waxing and lasering companies go broke,' Shedadie said.

'This guy will walk along Bondi Beach with his shirt off. He's really proud.'
