The pair begin to shake and gyrate as the music builds - before Tamwar takes to the floor to flail his arms around - somewhat erratically

As the music starts Tamwar - wearing a helmet - and Fatboy can be seen slowly coming into shot.

The pair then begin to shake and gyrate as the music builds - before Tamwar takes to the floor to flail his arms around - somewhat erratically.

They then appear to have a kind of dance off as Fatboy launches into some energetic body popping.

The concept of the new craze is simple -  the videos are about 30 seconds long and set to Harlem Shake by New York DJ Baauer.

Each clip tends to begin with one person dancing alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room ignores them. 

Then, as the bass line drops, everyone goes wild.

The BBC video, which has been posted on YouTube, has already attracted 48,594 views on the site.

Many of the performers wear facemasks or helmets, strange costumes and fancy dress - there is commonly someone dancing in their underwear. 

Last year saw huge success for K-pop rapper Psy, thanks to his smash hit Gangnam Style.

But unlike Gangnam Style there are no specific dance moves.

Most dancers perform crotch thrusts, waves their arms up and down, or stand on their hands.

Office workers, university students, friends and firemen have all made their own short video clips and posted them on YouTube.

Some performers have even taken to the snow wearing little clothing to perform the famous dance.

A version apparently performed by Norwegian soldiers has been one of the most popular.

The Harlem Shake phenomenon has been around since the 1980s, but it was this recent meme which has catapulted it into mainstream culture across the world.
