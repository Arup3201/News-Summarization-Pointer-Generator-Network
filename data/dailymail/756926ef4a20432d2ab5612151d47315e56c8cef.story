Two friends from New Hampshire are lucky to be alive today after their boat capsized off the Massachusetts coast, leaving them to fend for themselves in the chilly water for 15 hours until they were rescued by a passing fishing vessel.

The New Hampshire men spent Friday night sitting on a plank over two hulls of 25-foot trimaran as waves left them soaked and cold.

George Reynolds said he and Fred Schaeffer recited Scripture verses and prayed for strength — and calm seas and wind — as their muscles cramped and they violently shivered as they tried to stay warm.

‘It was a real test of my faith,’ Reynolds, of Derry, said from his home. ‘I said, “Lord, whatever your will is, I'm in the mercy of your hands, and if this is going to be the end, I'm trusting in your mercy.”’

Reynolds, 62, and Schaeffer, of Raymond, who's in his late 40s, put Reynolds' boat, the Ark Angel, in the water in Salem, Massachusetts, on Friday with plans to sail to Boston.

But with winds blowing hard and the boat flying along at more than 25 knots, they decided part-way through the trip that it would be safer to turn back toward Salem. 

A strong gust of wind flipped the boat between 4 and 4.30pm a couple of miles from the mainland and more than a mile from the nearest island. Schaeffer's cell phone would not work once it got wet.

Reynolds took off his life vest and tried waving it to get the attention of a faraway fishing boat, but the wind blew it out of his hands into the water.

So he and his best friend put a plank across the hull and hunkered down, back-to-back to give each other warmth and support.

Through the night, with the air temperature dropping into the 40s and water temperatures at 58 degrees, the water lapped onto their plank and on occasion crashed over them.

Saturday morning's sunrise was a welcome sight.

‘When the sun rose, that was the most beautiful sunrise I've ever seen,’ Reynolds said.

Sometime after 7am, they got the attention of a passing fishing boat named Fishy Business, which rescued them and brought them to shore in Salem.

‘They were very cold. They were very thankful that we found them and that we took them in,’ Eddie Pereira, who was captain of the rescue boat, told ABC News.

The capsizing survivors suffered from slight hypothermia and were shaken by the ordeal, but denied medical treatment and set out for home after being examined by first responders. 

Salem Harbormaster Mil McHugh told the station WCVB that the armature seafarers had no waterproof means of portable communication or any distress equipment aboard the Ark Angel.

Reynolds, who owns a small welding fabrication business, said that he's been teaching Bible courses at a New Hampshire prison for more than 25 years and that he and Schaeffer attend church together.

‘My best friend was with me and we kind of dealt with it the best way we could,’ Reynolds saidUnfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.
