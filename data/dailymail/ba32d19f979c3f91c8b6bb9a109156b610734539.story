Pregnant women who use nicotine patches and gum increase their child's risk of obesity

Mothers-to-be who use nicotine patches or chewing gum could be making their children more prone to obesity.

Children face an increased risk of obesity if their mother uses nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) such as nasal spray or lozenges, as well as the more common forms like nicotine gum.

The dangers of smoking while pregnant are well established with years of advertisements reporting ‘smoking while pregnant harms your baby’.

Past studies have shown the chances of a baby being obese doubles if their mother smoked during pregnancy, but the effect of nicotine supplements was not known.

The new research suggests that not only do pregnant women who use NRT have smaller babies, but that within six months the nicotine has affected their liver so it produces more triglyceride - a sign of obesity.

Dr Daniel Hardy of the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry at the Western University in London, Canada, said: ‘We knew smoking was bad during pregnancy.

‘But the problem is one fifth of pregnant women in Canada continue to smoke, and 30 prospective studies have shown us that that babies born to smoking mothers have a 47 per cent increase in the odds of becoming overweight.

‘And here's the interesting thing, that's even after adjusting for mum's diet and socio-economic status.

‘Our studies were designed to find if there is a biological basis between nicotine exposure from either NRT or smoking, and obesity and metabolic syndrome later in the offspring's life.’

Scientists found that lab rats which were given the same amount of nicotine, adjusted for weight, that an average smoker takes in a day had smaller babies, but that wasn't the most startling finding.

Six months after they were given the dose, when they reached adulthood, the rats had developed an increase in liver and circulating triglycerides, a sign of obesity.

Although NRT is still less harmful to the child than smoking, Dr Hardy said doctors may need to look more closely at the long-term safety and efficacy of nicotine in pregnancy on postnatal health and well-being.

Despite the increased risk of obesity, using NRT remains safer for an unborn baby than smoking is

The scientists are now looking at whether folic acid could prevent or reverse the nicotine damage to the developing liver.

Previously acid has been shown to reduce circulating triglycerides, and smoking mothers have been found to have low levels of folate, so scientists believe acid could be the key.

Children and adults both require folic acid to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anaemia.

The research is published online in the journal Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology.
