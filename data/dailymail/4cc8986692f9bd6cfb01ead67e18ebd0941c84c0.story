Barcelona defender Gerard Pique admits that he is still scared of former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane.

Pique made his Manchester United debut in October 2004 in a League Cup win over Crewe, which was also Keane's last season at Old Trafford.

The 27-year-old left Manchester in 2008 to join the Catalan giants.

But he told FourFourTwo: 'I wouldn't say I was scared of [Sir Alex Ferguson]. Roy Keane? Well, maybe that's different!'

'I remember we were in the changing room at Old Trafford and my phone started vibrating. Keano could hear the vibrations and went crazy trying to find out who the phone belonged to. That’s who he was.

'Before we [Barca] beat Celtic 1-0 last season, I noticed him by the side of the pitch as a pundit as we went to warm up. I hid my face with my hand because he still scares me. I was 26 years old, and I was sh*tting myself!'
