Thousands of cancer patients are being denied urgent tests by their GPs, figures show (file picture)

Thousands of cancer patients are being denied urgent tests by their GPs, figures show.

Family doctors are typically referring fewer than half of all victims for fast-track appointments that are meant to ensure they have the best chance of survival.

Campaigners say some patients with bowel cancer – one of the most common forms – have been back to their GP two or three times before being diagnosed, having initially been told they have irritable bowel syndrome.

The figures are revealed in league tables, published yesterday by NHS England, which rank surgeries by diagnosis and treatment for cancer and some other illnesses.

Government guidelines state that all patients suspected by their GP of having cancer must be referred for an urgent appointment with a hospital specialist within two weeks.

But the data shows that in one practice, 1 Marine Parade, in Lowestoft, Suffolk, only 6 per cent of patients were sent for these fast-track consultations.

At the Apollos Surgery in Birmingham only 7 per cent were referred within two weeks, while at the A. S. Khan surgery in Field Road Walsall it was 7.7 per cent.

But there were 18 practices where 100 per cent of patients had been given appointments within two weeks. None of the GP surgeries with the worst figures was available to comment.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the figures showed ‘unacceptable variation’ across the country.

‘Every single patient in the NHS has a right to the very best care,’ he added.

The figures also suggest that thousands of patients who have suffered strokes or mini-strokes are not being prescribed blood-thinning drugs by their GPs to prevent them happening again.

In the worst practices, 40 per cent of stroke victims were not being given this medication.

The number of knee replacements and cataract removal have fallen to their lowest level for five years, figures showed yesterday.

Campaigners say thousands of the elderly are being denied vital treatment to improve their quality of life due to NHS rationing.

Figures from Dr Foster Intelligence, which analyses performance across the Health Service, show the number of cataract removals dropped from 327,210 in 2010-11 to 321,957 last year.

Decline: The number of knee replacements and cataract removal have fallen to their lowest level for five years

The numbers of patients receiving a new knee, because of arthritis or a break, fell slightly, from 82,122 in 2011-12 to 81,572 last year.

Steve Winyard, head of campaigns at the RNIB, formerly the Royal National Institute for the Blind said: ‘It is scandalous that some commissioners continue to restrict access to cataract surgery through the use of arbitrary thresholds, and that they do so without a robust evidence base and without being able to demonstrate that they will not harm patients.’

Due to an error by the Care Quality Commission, an earlier version of this article mistakenly reported a low referral rate to the Field Road Surgery in Walsall. In fact this was the A. S. Khan surgery in Field Road.
