The earliest example of Roman irrigation in Britain, dating back almost 2,000 years, has been discovered in Cambridge - and it may have been used to produce wine.

A network of ditches and ridges was found on the site of a proposed new £1 billion development on farmland at the edge of the town, near the M11.

Researchers believe the channels were used as a vineyard, or to grow asparagus, and are being hailed as evidence of 'intense agriculture' dating back to around 70AD.

Historians have long suspected the 370-acre (150 hectare) site could have been home to an ancient Roman settlement.

Archaeologists were invited to explore the site 18 months ago before work begins on the major new development of housing, shops and a new school.

By March last year they had uncovered evidence the site was once home to a Bronze Age settlement pre-dating the Romans.

A team from the Cambridge Archaeological Unit have now uncovered the irrigation system across the northern section.

During the Roman Empire, level plains were used for cultivation.

To
 plough the soil, Roman farmers used a simple soil breaker called an 
‘ard’, pulled by oxen.

Fields were ploughed at various 
points at right angles to each other to create a flat and even surface. 

The Romans then built dams
 and reservoirs needed for irrigation.

Water
 collected in these dams and reservoirs and could then be distributed 
through channels easily and effectively, increasing the amount of crops 
that could be covered.

This was vital in producing enough food for the large and growing 
Roman population.

Water for crops and farms, as well as for public baths, fountains, 
and homes, was brought into cities and towns via Roman aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard aqueduct, (pictured above) in Roussillon, France.

Aqueducts
 were built on gradients, made of stone, brick or concrete. Most were 
buried underground, and many featured distribution tanks to control the 
supply when needed.

Team leader Chris Evans said it was evidence of an ‘intense agricultural regime’ dating as far back as 70AD.

‘Our findings from excavating around the ridgeway have unearthed zebra-like stripes of Roman planting beds that are encircled on their higher northern side by more deep pit-wells,’ continued Evans.

‘The gully-defined planting beds were closely set and were probably grapevines or possibly asparagus.

The Romans built dams, pit wells, pictured at the site in Cambridge, and reservoirs for irrigation. The find near the M11 is being hailed as evidence of 'intense agriculture' and is thought to be the earliest example of Roman irrigation in Britain

Historians have long suspected the 370-acre (150 hectare) site could have been home to an ancient Roman settlement and archaeologists are continuing to dig at the planned development on Cambridge University farmland between Huntingdon Road and the M11

Extraordinarily, after carefully peeling off the clays, we saw a series of ditches lining the wells and the horticultural beds.

‘Clearly in dry spells, water could have been poured from the pit-wells into the ditches to reach the beds.

‘This is a tremendously significant find that reflects the area's intense agricultural regime from the Roman period. It's an unparalleled discovery and the earliest evidence of Roman irrigation in Britain.

‘People don't think about wells and irrigation being a significant invention but it was incredibly sophisticated. I mean how many hours do women in Africa have to go to collect their water?’
