A family of six are living in a tent at the bottom of a friend's garden after being refused a council house because they would not abandon their pets.

Lorraine Botton, 54, and her five children moved from East Sussex to Kent with the promise of a new home, but got in a row over their four dogs and three budgies.

They claim they were told to give them away if they wanted a council property, so turned the house down.

Home: The Bottons say they were promised a new council house but have ended up in this garden because of a row over pets

For the last six weeks the family have been camping in a friend's garden and cooking on a portable stove.

Lorraine is squeezed inside the 12ft by 10ft tent - designed to sleep four - with children Moses, 18, Caleb, 19, Genty, 22, Louise, 26, and Naomi, 36 - as well as their pets.

It has two sleeping compartment designed for two adults in each and a central communal area.

They've managed to find room for some home comforts including a TV, fridge, tumble dryer, iron, an electric heater and lamps.

But they have no running water and are relying on their friends for their toilet, washing and laundry facilities.

Upset: While they have home comforts including a TV, fridge, tumble dryer, iron, an electric heater and lamps in their tent, it is not the house they wanted

Food: The six adults have been cooking off gas outside for the past six weeks as winter approaches

Housing chiefs in Maidstone, Kent have warned Lorraine it could be Christmas before a property which allows pets becomes available.

Argument: The family say they may be waiting until next Christmas for a home and fear they may 'freeze to death'

But she still refuses to get rid of her precious pets and said she would squat if nothing is found before winter.

She said: 'I feel scared that someone will unzip the tent and hurt us, or even murder us.

'We need a property as soon as possible so we are safe. I just want to be able to lock my front door.

'If we don't get a house soon, we will have to squat.

'I've been told there might not be anything available until Christmas, and we can't wait that long. We'll freeze to death.

'The tent leaks and it is cold. I have to go outside with a little cooker to make food, often in the rain.

'That is not right. I shouldn't have to beg people for baths or to do my washing.'

Lorraine, who suffers from epilepsy and arthritis, claims she was hounded out of their last home in Hastings, East Sussex.

She and her family stayed in a B&B for two years before moving to Maidstone in August to be closer to relatives.

A Maidstone Borough Council spokesman said he could not comment on specific housing applications but admitted there was a 'limited supply' of social housing.

He said: 'We have a responsibility to provide families in priority housing need with emergency accommodation, and whilst they are in temporary accommodation to assess their need.

'If we accept a family on to the housing register, it can take some time to find suitable accommodation depending on their circumstances and availability.'Â
