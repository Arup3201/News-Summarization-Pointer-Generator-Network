The final, ultra-expensive F-22 Raptor fighter jet rolled off the assembly line at an aircraft plant on Tuesday.

The jet got a send-off at the Lockheed Martin factory at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia.

The U.S. military will now turn its attention to the less costly F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Fox News reports.

The twin-engine F-22 Raptor is one of the fastest, most manoeuvrable jets in operation.

It has a confidential top speed and the ability to cruise at more than 1.5 times the speed of sound without using its afterburner.

However, plans to add seven more F-22s to the U.S. Air Force's fleet of 187 were in 2009 cancelled by Congress, saving $1.75billion from the defence department's budget.

There have been concerns in Washington that the F-22 is too hi-tech.

Congress has banned its sale overseas because it was deemed that the technology involved is too sensitive to share with other countries.

Various foreign governments want to buy an F-22.

Critics of the jet also argue that it is not needed any more and is a costly waste of time.

Despite its undoubted power, it has not seen any action in Iraq or Afghanistan.

The official price tag is $153million, but factor in research, development and maintenance costs and gthat figure could double.

The F-22 supports 900 jobs but Lockheed Martin says shutting down the F-22 program will not impact on jobs because workers will be deployed on other projects, including increased production of the F-35.

The U.S. military fleet currently has an operational fleet of 187 Raptors.
