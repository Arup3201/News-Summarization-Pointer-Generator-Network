A war hero who risked his life to help transport crucial supplies to Russia in the Second World War has been told by the Foreign Office that he cannot accept a medal for valour.

Frank Wilson, now 88, was one of the gallant seamen who braved German submarines and sub zero temperatures as part of the British Arctic convoys.

The perilous sea campaign, nicknamed the ‘Russian Run’, claimed 3,000 lives, but Mr Wilson, who joined the Royal Navy when he was 18, and was a gunner on the escort carrier HMS Activity, survived despite being shot.

Valour: Frank Wilson, 88, has been blocked by the Foreign Office from accepting the medal from the Russians

Mr Wilson joined the navy when he was just 18 and took part in the famous 'Russian Run' supplying Russian troops

He was delighted and honoured when the Russian Embassy wrote to him to tell him they intended to honour him and other veterans with the Medal of Ushakov, as a symbol of the country’s gratitude.

But the Foreign Office has blocked the Russian government’s plans because it said it would break rules surrounding the acceptance of medals

'After all these years I was honoured when the Embassy contacted me to say I was going to receive the medal as a token of thanks for what I and others did for their country in the Second World War,” said Mr Wilson, from Chesterfield.

'The British Arctic convoy was often described as the worst journey in the world and that about summed it up.

'The conditions were terrible , it was unbelievably cold, like working in a freezer and the sea was ferocious. Once you started on a convoy you didn’t have a wash for six weeks because you couldn’t get your clothes off, it was too cold.

'The journey was fraught with danger. It’s a part of the war that isn’t mentioned and seem to have largely been forgotten. I don’t think people realise what an important job we did and the difference it made to the war.

'We kept Russia supplied with food and arms and there is no doubt in my mind that without the convoys the outcome of the war would have been very different.

'The Russians would have been crushed and the Germans would have taken this country too and we would be all be speaking their language.

Those who took part in the British Arctic convoy ran a gauntlet of U-boats and vicious weather conditions to bolster efforts on the Eastern Front

'Thousands died, I saw comrades killed. I was shot through the cheek and the bullet shattered all my back teeth. I had to stay on the ship for a fortnight until I got any proper treatment but I was one of the lucky ones.”

Added Mr Wilson: 'I feel proud that the medal is being awarded but I feel let down that I cannot receive it. I think its ridiculous and typical of this Government.

'The Foreign Office need to have a serious re think about it. This is a medal for valour but that doesn’t seem to matter much these days.'

Russia has already awarded the Ushakov Medal to veterans from Australia, Canada and America.A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'Wer appreciate the Russian Government’s wish to recognise the brave and valuable service given by veterans of the Arctic Convoys.

'But permission to accept a foreign award cannot be given unless there has been specific service to the country concerned within the previous five years.”

The spokesman added that the Arctic Convoy veterans were eligible for the World War II Atlantic Star but the veterans argue that men who served in the Arctic Convoys had already earned the Atlantic Star before being conscripted on to the dreaded ‘Russian Run’.

A Russian Embassy spokesman said the situation was 'regrettable. but added they would continue to make the case for the award to the British authorities.
