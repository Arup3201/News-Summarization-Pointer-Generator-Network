With themes of treachery, revenge, incest and murder, it was once one of Shakespeare's most popular tragedies.

But it seems the 'slings and arrows of outrageous fortune' are too violent for today's audiences, after a writer was denied access to an online version of Hamlet by the British Library's wi-fi network.

Mark Forsyth was working on his latest book in the library when he decided to check a line from the text.

Hamlet has been deemed a little too rich for today's audiences it seems, after a writer using the British Library's wi-fi network was denied access to an online version of the play

But, the online browser would not allow him access because the play included 'violent content', the BBC reports.

He wrote of the incident on his blog.

According to the British Library the error occurred because of a newly installed wi-fi service. It is provided by a third-party provider.

A spokesman said the text has now been made accessible, adding: 'The upgraded service has a web filter to ensure that inappropriate content cannot be viewed on-site.'

The Government has recently announced plans for pornography to be blocked by UK internet provides unless customers opt out.

Laurence Olivier plays the tragic Hamlet, in 1948, which was blocked by the British Library for 'violent content'

But campaigners and activists are said to be concerned about the plans because they say the banned sites could expand to include pages that should be available.

A Cambridge 
University security expert, told the BBC it was 'completely inappropriate' to have an internet filter at the British Library.

Prof Ross Anderson, said all legal content should be available over the library's wi-fi network.

He said: 'The only things they should block are the few dozen books against which there are court judgements in the UK. One of the functions of deposit libraries is to keep everything, including smut.'
