An ex-soldier who risked her life detecting explosives in Afghanistan has been left homeless.

Private Lauren Dobbs, 23, who was a military dog handler, has been denied council housing, despite David Cameron's pledge to give higher housing priority to former armed forces personnel.

Instead she was offered a bed at a night shelter - but only if the temperature falls below freezing.

Disgrace: Former soldier Lauren Dobbs, 23, who risked her life detecting explosives in Afghanistan, has been left homeless after being denied council housing

Private Dobbs said: 'I think it is just ridiculous - I am very annoyed but there is nothing I can do.

'It is completely unfair. I have colleagues in the Army who have had to rejoin, or have not been able to leave, because they have not been homed.'

Private Dobbs spent six years in the Army, and was a military dog handler in the Vet Corps - a job involving handling specialist dogs capable of detecting arms and explosives.

Six months after leaving the armed forces she claims her plans for a new independent life are being scuppered by the failure of Bromley Council, in Kent, to find her a new home.

Fortunately Ms Dobbs, who is 
currently studying to be a personal trainer, has been able to stay with 
her mother, but she has been angered by the council's failure to look 
after her.

She added: 'I left because I wanted to move on and do other things.

'The Army was what I had always wanted to do and after that the personal training. I think it should be a higher pay band.

'The fact you are paid as much as you are makes it harder when you leave.'

Her mother, Michelle Lynn, 47, of Biggin Hill, said: 'My daughter's friends have had their limbs blown off, they have been killed and this is all the council can do.

'It is not good enough. My daughter was fighting for her country.

'It is disgraceful that they treat someone who fights for their country like this.

'When soldiers leave the army they cannot afford a mortgage, their wages are atrocious - what are they supposed to do?'

Bromley Council said: 'It is not appropriate to discuss someone's individual circumstances but we can confirm our approach is to work with a person faced with homelessness and with their families to help prevent this happening.

'This includes giving advice and guidance and helping them look at the different housing options available.

'We work with a person to establish their circumstances and whether they are priority need under existing housing legislation.'
