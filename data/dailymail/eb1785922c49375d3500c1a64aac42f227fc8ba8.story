The full horrific scale of the threat to our wildlife from the plastic rubbish polluting our seas has been exposed in a landmark study.

It found that nearly 400 marine species are at risk as a result of the tons of shopping bags, fishing nets and other waste dumped in the oceans each year.

Puffins, turtles, seals and whales are among the creatures that have swallowed or become entangled in plastic bags.

The most comprehensive impact study in nearly two decades found many of the world’s most endangered marine species are now threatened.

Hawaiian monk seals, North Atlantic right whales, African penguins and loggerhead turtles have all become caught up in fishing lines, choked on plastic bags or swallowed bottle tops. 

The problem has increased by nearly 50 per cent since the previous study was carried out in 1997, British scientists said last night.

Separate research published last week revealed that so much plastic is dumped into the sea each year that it would fill five carrier bags for every foot of coastline on the planet.

The Daily Mail has been campaigning since 2008 for tougher action to reduce the problem. In a major victory last year, it was announced that supermarkets and large stores in England will charge 5p per plastic bag from October.

The move is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £100million a year for good causes.

In the new study, biologists at Plymouth University scoured records going back to the 1960s, and found scientific records of 395 species which had ingested or become entangled in rubbish. 

Since the 1960s, nearly 400 marine species are recorded as having swallowed or become entangled in plastic and glass waste. Of those, 67 are on the Red List of threatened and endangered species. These include Hawaiian monk seals (left), African penguins (right) and loggerhead sea turtles

A further 300 species were seen living with debris, either making their nests out of rubbish or swimming among trash on the seabed

Of these, 67 are on the international Red List of threatened and endangered animals. A further 300 species were seen living with debris, either making their nests out of plastic rubbish or swimming among trash on the seabed.

Plastic accounted for nearly 92 per cent of cases, according to the paper published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin.

The Daily Mail has been campaigning since 2008 to for tougher action to reduce plastic bag waste.

A major victory came in June last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in England.

The charge, which will be introduced by October, is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £100million a year for good causes.

Co-author Professor Richard Thompson, one of the world’s leading experts on plastic in the marine environment, said the findings bolster evidence that our throwaway society could be driving some species towards extinction.

He told the Daily Mail last night: ‘I am not anti-plastic – it has huge benefits. But we need to learn to realise those benefits without creating mountains of debris.

‘We need to try to reverse this trend – it is going to take several decades to do this, but it is possible.’

The study reports that global production of plastic increased from five million tons per year in the 1960s to 280million tons in 2011. It added: ‘It is evident that despite efforts to remove debris from the marine environment, and restrictions on dumping at sea, quantities of plastic are increasing in some locations.’

The increase in dumped plastic seems to be having a direct effect on marine animals.

When US ecologist David Laist last looked at the problem 18 years ago, 267 species were recorded as having swallowed or become entangled in rubbish. Now that figure has risen by 49 per cent.

Not all incidents led to death –only 4 per cent of cases of plastic ingestion, for example.

Around 8 million tonnes of plastic bottles, bags, toys and other plastic rubbish ends up in the world’s oceans each year, according to a separate study by the University of Georgie. The total is much higher than previous estimates and enough to leave an area around 25 times the size of Manchester ankle-deep in plastic waste

But the scientists said it is likely that plastic caused unrecorded injuries other than death, and further research is needed to build a clearer picture of the damage this pollution is causing.

Sarah Gall, who co-wrote the study, said: ‘We found that all known species of sea turtle, and more than half of all species of marine mammal and seabird had been affected by marine debris.

‘In nearly 80 per cent of entanglement cases, this had resulted in direct harm or death.’

So much plastic is dumped into the sea each year that it would fill five carrier bags for every foot of coastline on the planet, scientists have warned.

Around 8 million tonnes of plastic bottles, bags, toys and other plastic rubbish ends up in the world’s oceans each year.

The ‘staggering’ total is much higher than previous estimates - and enough to leave an area around 25 times the size of Manchester ankle-deep in plastic waste.

Because of the difficulties in working out the exact amount, since much of it may have sunk, the scientists said the true figure could be as much as 12.7 million tons polluting the ocean each year.

Dr Jenna Jambeck, one of the researchers from the University of Georgia in the US, said we are becoming ‘overwhelmed by our waste’.
