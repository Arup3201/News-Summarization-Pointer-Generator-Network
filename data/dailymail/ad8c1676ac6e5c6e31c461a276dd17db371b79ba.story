A man who murdered his sister's ex-boyfriend will spend at least the next 20 years in prison.

Paul Mapps, 26, stabbed 27-year-old father-of-one Ian Davies in the stomach during a row at his sister's birthday party in Trinant, South Wales, on January 11.

Cardiff Crown Court heard that the defendant and the dead man had previously been friends, but their friendship soured after Mr Davies' relationship with Mapps' sister Dawn, 30, ended.

Mapps had denied murder and insisted he was acting in self-defence because father-of-one Mr Davies 'came at him' with a vodka bottle.

But the jury, which came to a majority verdict, rejected his version of events and ruled that the killing was intentional.

Before handing Mapps a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years, Judge Neil Bidder QC said he had shown 'no remorse' throughout the two-week trial.

He told him: 'I reject any suggestion you were acting in self-defence when you stabbed Mr Davies.

'You plainly have difficulty in controlling your anger.

'There is only one sentence I can impose... that is life imprisonment.

'You will serve a minimum of 20 years in jail and will only be released if you are deemed no longer a danger to the public.'

Gwent Police Chief Inspector Richard Williams paid tribute to Mr Davies' family for their bravery and dignity during the trial.

He said: 'Throughout the trial they have listened to some particularly upsetting details about Ian's death.

'They have remained dignified and I would like to acknowledge their bravery.

'Since Ian's death Paul Mapps has sought to absolve himself of any responsibility by first claiming someone else was responsible and, when this was disproved, claiming he was acting in self-defence.

'His attempts to deceive the court have failed. I hope the verdict brings the family some closure.'

Mr Davies' older sister, Carrie, said the family felt a sense of relief that justice had been served - though they would never get over their loss completely.

'It goes without saying that this has been an extremely difficult and challenging time for the family,' she said in a statement issued by police.

'Although the outcome doesn't ease our great sense of loss, we can now start to move forward with our lives, and focus our efforts on looking after and supporting Caine, Ian's six-year-old son.'
