Michelle Obama's fringe was the subject of debate on Twitter after she appeared to have trouble keeping it out of her eyes while giving a speech.

The First Lady had a blunt fringe - or bangs as they say in the U.S. - cut in January earlier this year.

But in May she reverted to her longer, side-swept look after the President spoofed the look in some Photoshopped pictures shown during his annual speech at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April.

And today as she gave a speech at the G8 summit in Belfast, the First Lady went for a softer look with flicks reminiscent of Farrah Fawcett in the 70s.

Fringegate: Michelle Obama's new longer 'bangs', as they are called in the U.S., may look softer - but viewers said it annoyed them when it constantly fell into her eyes

Trendy: The look, debuted by Michelle today at the G8 summit in Belfast, was reminiscent of Farrah Fawcett in the 70s - but it didn't win her many fans in cyberspace

And it was her growing locks that got cyberspace talking while she gave the televised speech in Belfast today.

One user, Sue Crossan (@scrossannz), wrote on Twitter: 'Watching Michelle Obama's speech in Belfast. Impressive but I wish she would get her fringe sorted out. #badhairday.'

Another user called Brennan McKeag (@brennanmckeag) added: 'Michelle Obama's fringe annoyed me the whole way through her speech, why didn't she just sweep it off her face!?'

Nessa O'Mahoney (@Nessao) tweeted: 'Michelle Obama is a terrific speaker this morning. Inspirational. Why do I desperately want to give her a hair clip?'

Got the message: At an event just a few hours later, her hair was more firmly cast out of her eyeline

Much better: Earlier in the day (left), her bangs were astray but the fringe was cast in place for a visit to The Gaiety Theatre in Dublin on Monday evening (right)

The speech saw the First lady urge around 2,000 schoolchildren, university students and graduates to step outside their comfort zones, challenge the status quo and help create a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.

Mrs Obama spoke for 10 minutes before her husband took to the stage, and was introduced by 16-year-old schoolgirl Hannah Nelson, who spoke of her desire to see greater stability in Northern Ireland.

She later flew to Dublin with daughters Malia, 14, and Sasha, 12.

Disheveled: The errant hair caught the attention of members of the audience

Fringe whinge: These Twitter uses lashed out at Michelle's unruly fringe during her speech today

Bang on trend? Left, Michelle's longer, 70s style fringe that riled Twitter users today in Belfast. Right, the original fringe that garnered endless attention in a portrait released by the White House in February this year
