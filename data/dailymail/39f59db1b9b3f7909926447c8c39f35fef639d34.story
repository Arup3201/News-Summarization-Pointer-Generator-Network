The swell of national pride that accompanied London's staging of the 2012 Olympic Games has perhaps saturated the memory banks of most this year.

But leaving tear-inducing medal ceremonies and previously undiscovered sporting enthusiasm to the side, this year has been a memorable one for more than just athletic reasons.

The Royal Family did their utmost to keep the bunting industry afloat, delighting punters across the country with the jubilee celebrations, as Kate and William established themselves as the nation's most prominent and photogenic power couple.

On a more serious level 2012 will also be remembered for its political scandals, the Leveson inquiry, revelations about Jimmy Savile and a whole host of other dramas.

And what better way to recap on both the highs and lows of 2012 than with a visual review, with photographs taken from the Press Association's Picture Review of the Year.
