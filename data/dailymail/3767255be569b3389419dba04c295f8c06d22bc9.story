Fire taken from the Eternal Flame at John F Kennedy's graveside has arrived in Ireland on a flight from New York.

The flame forms part of celebrations planned in Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of his visit to his ancestral homeland.

President Kennedy’s four-day trip was a key moment in Irish history - he embodied the ultimate success story - the great-grandson of an Irish famine emigrant had become the most powerful man in the world.

The president's niece Kathleen 
Kennedy Townsend, former Lieutenant Governor of Maryland joked: 'I know you've 
been focused on the G8 – now I hope you focus on the K35.'

Caroline Kennedy, daughter of John and Jackie, is also in the country on a holiday, reported the Irish Independent.

Kathleen, who is the eldest of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's children, explained that it was an emotional occasion for the family.

'It means so much because when 
President Kennedy came here, he was overwhelmed with the love of the 
Irish people, and his last words were that he would come back in the 
spring. He never got to come back, but we're getting to come back,' she 
told the newspaper.

Mr Kennedy received a rapturous 
welcome on an emotional visit to his ancestral homeland - five months 
later he was shot in the head as he drove through Dallas, Texas.

Hundreds of wellwishers cheered and 
waved flags on his arrival at Wexford town - he was the first Catholic 
president as well as an Irish-American.

He also traveled to New Ross from 
where Patrick Kennedy, his great-grandfather, had set sail for a better 
life in America back in 1848 during the potato famine.

During his visit. he said: ''I want to express my pleasure at being back from whence I came.'

President Kennedy's visit and the 
inspiring speeches he delivered were to change forever how the Irish 
perceived themselves, particularly in relation to the emigrant 
experience and the Diaspora.

During his speech on the quayside he 
said; 'When my great-grandfather left here to become a cooper in East 
Boston he carried nothing with him except two things – a strong 
religious faith and a strong desire for liberty. I am glad to say that 
all of his grandchildren have valued that inheritance...'

Sean Reidy, the chief executive of the JFK Trust, told the BBC:
'People left under great hardship. They arrived in America. But the 
story we tell is not just of them leaving. It's the story of what 
happened when they arrived and the onward development and progression of
the Irish in America to the ultimate success of a great-grandson of a 
famine emigrant becoming president.'

This morning fire taken from the Eternal Flame at his graveside arrived in Ireland.

Unaware: President JFK and his wife Jackie riding in the motorcade before he was shot. He had promoised to visit Ireland again the following spring

The flame arrived in a specially-designed miner's lamp identical to the one used to bring the Olympic flame from Athens to London last year.

On Saturday, his daughter Caroline Kennedy and his sister Jean Kennedy Smith will use the torch to light an 'emigrant flame' in the town of New Ross.

Officials say the flame will symbolize the many emigrants, including JFK's great-grandfather, who left Ireland to start anew.

They will also raise the U.S flag as part of the 'Homecoming' celebrations as well as an American home Homecoming parade.
