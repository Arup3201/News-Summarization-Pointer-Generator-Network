Marvin Travon Hicks, 47, of Palmdale, California, was convicted of second-degree murder on Friday

A man who led police on a high-speed chase while high on PCP before slamming his car into another and killing a two-year-old girl has been found guilty of murder.

Marvin Travon Hicks, 47, of Palmdale, California, was convicted of second-degree murder on Friday in the DUI pursuit crash that ended with the death of 2-year-old Madison Ruano.

Madison had been considered a ‘miracle’ child by her parents after she survived being born severely prematurely at 25 weeks and weighing less than two pounds.

Jurors had found Hicks guilty of several felony counts including gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and DUI causing injury in April, but were unable to reach a verdict on the murder count.

A different jury deliberated for just three hours on Friday before finding Hicks guilty of second-degree murder.

According to the official report, police started pursuing his vehicle after he ran a red light on Sierra Highway on December 6, 2012.

Authorities say he then weaving between cars going at speeds over 100 mph and even drove briefly on the wrong side of the road in an attempt to avoid authorities.

It was at that point that Hicks drove his black Toyota straight into the blue Lexus driven by Madison’s mother Tina Ruano, 37.

Both the woman and child suffered massive trauma to their upper body and were immediately taken to the hospital.

Under the influence of PCP and alcohol: Photographs from the scene show the front of Hicks' car was completely totaled and he had a difficult time standing as he was pulled by police from his vehicle

The blunt force trauma from the crash disconnected Madison’s spinal cord and she was pronounced dead at Antelope Valley Hospital, reports KTLA. 

Photographs from the scene show the front of Hicks' car was completely totaled and that he had a difficult time standing as he was pulled by police from his vehicle.

According to court testimony, Hicks was under the influence of PCP and alcohol at the time of the crash.

Records show he had a long history of drunk and reckless driving, including convictions for driving under the influence and misdemeanor hit and run dating as far back as 1995.

Madison's family described the toddler as being a 'precious little light to ALL who encountered her'

Hicks now faces 21 years to life in state prison and will be sentenced on October 10.

A memorial page on Facebook set up by Madison's family describes the toddler as being a ‘precious little light to ALL who encountered her.’ 

It describes how she managed to survive, despite being born nearly three months early and at only 1 pound and 14 ounces.

By the time Madison left the hospital, she was a healthy four pounds, much to the relief of her parents.

‘We know that Madison is now in the arms of our dear Lord, Jesus,’ the page reads. ‘We are thankful for her life and the short time that we had her with us.'
