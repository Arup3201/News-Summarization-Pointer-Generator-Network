Manchester City will resist any attempt by Inter Milan to take striker Stevan Jovetic back to Italy.

Inter are understood to have made an inquiry about taking Jovetic on loan with a view to a permanent £18million transfer.

City paid £22m to sign the Montenegro international from Fiorentina last summer and want to keep him at the Etihad Stadium despite an injury-hit first season in English football.

Buy Jove? Inter Milan are interested in taking Manchester City forward Stevan Jovetic back to Italy

Jovetic only made two Premier League starts among a total of 18 appearances, scoring six goals, and was a disappointment in comparison to other new signings Fernandinho, Alvaro Negredo and Jesus Navas.

The 24-year-old will start next season as fourth-choice striker behind Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Negredo, but manager Manuel Pellegrini saw enough in the second half of last season to believe that Jovetic can still be a success in the Premier League.

Waiting game: Manchester City are relaxed about the delay in completing a deal for Porto midfielder Fernando

Meanwhile, City are understood to be relaxed over the delay in completing a £14.5m deal for FC Porto midfielder Fernando.

The 26-year-old player has returned to Brazil while his representatives finalise the terms of his departure from Porto, but City are comfortable that their end of the deal has already been agreed.

The Premier League champions expect Samir Nasri to sign a new contract when he returns for pre-season training after agreeing terms with the Frenchman.
