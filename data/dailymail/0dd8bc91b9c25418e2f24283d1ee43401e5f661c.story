QPR boss Harry Redknapp admitted his side were "hanging on for their lives" before Bobby Zamora scored the goal which took them back to the Barclays Premier League in injury time.

Zamora struck in stoppage time to claim a 1-0 win over Derby at Wembley as Rangers secured their place back in the top flight at the first time of asking after they survived a tough second half following the 60th minute sending off of Gary O'Neil.

'It was a fantastic finish,' Redknapp 
said of Zamora's strike, 'We were maybe trying to take the game to 
penalties with a draw and were hanging on for our lives.

'It was a fantastic goal to win the game and I couldn't be more pleased.

'I would be a liar if I said I thought I would see us scoring. They had 11 men, were probing us and we were hanging on.

'That was a one off where you stand on the touchline, hanging on for grim death and get a goal like that.

'I want to do it for the people here (at Wembley), the owners and the players. They are fantastic people.'

Redknapp felt that the dismissal of O'Neil was harsh, not that it mattered too much after the final whistle.

'I thought he wasn't the last man, I thought there was another defender behind him,' the Rs boss added.

'We know how good we can be when we worked and we've worked really hard.
