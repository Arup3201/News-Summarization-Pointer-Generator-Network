With the new outdoor athletics season getting underway, Usain Bolt is making sure he's in tip top condition as he looks to continue his domination of the sprinting world.

The Jamaican showed that despite all his success in recent years, it's not enough and wants to add more medals to his already impressive collection. 

The reigning Olympic champion posted the video of his gruelling gym session on his Instagram page and showed an impressive range of core and arm strength.

Bolt will compete in a sprint competition in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil next month as he looks to acclimatise to the city where he will compete for the 2016 Olympic Games.

'Mano a Mano' takes places at the Jockey Club after being held at the Copacabana Beach for the previous two years. 

Bolt will race three other athletes on a 100 metres track on April 19, as he continues to keep up his fitness for the outdoor season.
