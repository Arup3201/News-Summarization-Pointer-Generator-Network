Two boy racers who killed a grandmother by smashing in to a taxi she was travelling in with such force she was thrown through the window were jailed today.

Mary Byrne, 51, had arrived at her home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, when the taxi she was in was hit by a speeding BMW - which was racing with a Ford Focus.

The impact was so great, the grandmother-of-seven was thrown through the window of the vehicle - suffering from fatal injuries.

The BMW 330i was driven by Joseph Robinson, 23, who pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving after initially denying the charge.

He was jailed for five years and three months at Bradford Crown Court today.

Thomas Healey, 21, who was driving the Ford Focus ST, was found guilty of the same charge after a two week trial. He received a six-year sentence.

Both men were handed five-year driving bans, also.

Sentencing, Judge John Potter said: 'This was a spur of the moment decision by two 
young and, it appears, intelligent men driving high powered vehicles to 
indulge themselves in a high speed chase, deciding to race each other 
other perhaps in a view to test each other’s macho-inspired bravado.'

He told the court their lack of care for other people 'amounts to almost indescribable selfishness'.

Judge Potter said both vehicles were driving between 60 and 70mph on roads with a speed limit of 30mph.

When Robinson hit the taxi he was travelling at around 63mph, the court heard. Mrs Byrne's daughter said  today the family were 'glad' the pair had been sentenced - but that it 'wasn't going to bring mum back'

When
 Robinson, of Bradford, hit Mrs Byrne’s taxi he was driving at around 
63mph, he was travelling so fast when he came over the brow of the hill 
on her road he was unable to stop in time.

Judge Potter added: 'It
 was your decision to behave in this way and the subsequent driving that
 followed to have fatal consequences, taking the life of Mrs Byrne and 
creating that chasm in the lives of her bereaved family that that exists
 this day and for evermore.'

Robinson was also charged with obtaining insurance by making false statements.

Judge
 Potter told him: 'In this context you indulged in racing the car with a
 complete stranger’s vehicle for 15 minutes over two miles with fatal 
consequences.

'This selfish and wholly inconsiderate attitude to others is reflected in the manner in which you drove the BMW.'

Mrs Byrne, a mother-of-four, was returning from 
celebrating a friend’s birthday to the home she had shared with her 
partner of 27 years Alan Jones when tragedy 
struck.

In a cruel twist of fate the accident happened just a few steps from the gates of a primary school where a poster by her granddaughter Grace pleaded for drivers to be considerate.

The court heard how Healey briefly stopped at the scene following the smash on April 20 last year before turning around and driving off.

He later attended a police station and was arrested.

Scores of tributes line the pavement outside the Bradford home of Mrs Bryne. Her daughter said today she was 'missed every single day'

Healey, of Bradford, was driving a car registered to his dad.

Speaking after sentencing Mrs Byrne’s daughter, Sarah Harrison, 32, said: 'She is just missed every single day, it doesn’t get any easier.'

Leading up to the crash Robinson, who 
was on bail for a previous driving offence and was driving with faked 
insurance documents, had been seen driving in an aggressive manner.

He
 had been weaving in and out of cars and one concerned motorist had even
 taken a picture of his vehicle and given it to the police.

Her eldest daughter, Sam Rees, 34, said: 'We are glad that they have been sentenced but we echo what the judge said, it’s not going to change it.

'Whatever they got sentenced is never going to bring mum back but their families will know what its like to lose a loved one for a couple of years.'

Following the tragedy, councillors and local MP Gerry Sutcliffe added their support to calls for traffic calming measures where Mrs Byrne was killed.

Since then Bradford Council has spent £10,000 installing speed humps, traffic islands and solar-powered road signs in the area.
