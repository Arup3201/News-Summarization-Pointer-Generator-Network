It might look like the plush inside of an enormous private jet but this stunning interior actually belongs to a British farmer's Land Rover.

The iconic Land Rover Defender, which is a favourite of the Royal Family, is known for its basic interior and off-road capability.

However, one mystery wealthy farmer decided he wanted the classic design with added luxury and spent £80,000 for an Essex-based firm to transform his vehicle.

Plush: The interior of the iconic Land Rover Defender has been given a luxurious £80,000 makeover and now features foldaway tables, a drinks cabinet with crystal glassware, a fridge, dimmable mood lighting and built-in computers hosting Windows 8

Luxury: Clive Drake, of Essex-based firm Carisma Auto Design which carried out the plush £80,000 makeover, said: 'Clients come to us because they know that we can achieve the impossible and deliver a vehicle to them that exceeds their expectations'

The pimped up Land Rover, which was customised by Carisma Auto Design, has swapped its classic seats for swanky, quilted adjustable chairs

The farmer, who wanted to remain anonymous, got in touch with Carisma Auto Design, a firm experienced in converting and customising cars, which set about transforming the 4x4.

The result is the Carisma Defender D1 - an £80,000 transformation of the trusty off-roader, which usually costs in the region of £20,000 to £30,000.

It now boasts foldaway tables, a drinks cabinet with lead crystal glassware, a fridge, dimmable mood lighting, on-board computers with Windows 8, Bluetooth, wifi and a Bang & Olufson sound system.

Ceiling and side panels have been finished in a matching quilt trim and the interior is made of Connolly hide.

Clive
 Drake, sales boss a the South East firm, said: 'Satisfying special and
 unusual requests is a key part of our specialist skills and services.

'Clients
 come to us because they know that we can achieve the impossible and 
deliver a vehicle to them that exceeds their expectations.

'Trust me, we've been asked to incorporate some truly outlandish features, but we still manage to integrate them seamlessly into the vehicle's interior.'

It has a 2.2-litre diesel engine which develops 122bhp, giving the Land Rover Defender a 0-62mph time of 14.7 seconds and a top speed of 90mph.
