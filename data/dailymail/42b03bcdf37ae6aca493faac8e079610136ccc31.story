A peace has been negotiated between a Queens, New York McDonald's and the group of local seniors hogging up their tables for hours, sustaining themselves on cheap coffee and packets of small fries.

Assemblyman Ron Kim held a press conference across the street from the fast food chain Monday to announce that management would loosen the 20-minute seating rule during off-peak hours after the seniors in turn agreed to give up their seats between10am and 3pm if asked by diners.

Additionally, the restaurant will be looking into hiring employees who speak Korean and Mandarin - the primary languages of the neighborhood seniors - and a group will start providing transport to a local senior center to alleviate congestion in the restaurant.

'We had to dig deeper to comprehend the pride of a small business owner as well as the pride of our seniors to seek a place to socialize,' Assemblyman Kim said.

The new deal: A McDonald's branch in Flushing, Queens made a deal with the group of elderly locals who caused problems taking up all their seating

The franchise's owner Jack Bert made a statement, saying the deal would create an environment 'where all customers who wish to enjoy this restaurant have the ability to do so'. 

'I’ve been proud to serve this community for nearly 20 years and my restaurant has been happy to welcome these customers for years,' Mr Bert added.

Kwang Kim, the president of Korean Community Services, will also be providing a bus to a senior center that was previously hard to get to since it is several miles away.

His group will be working with the McDonald's to hire Mandarin and Korean speakers for the Flushing regulars.

Concessions: According to the new deal, management will loosen the 20-minute seating rule if the seniors agree to give up their tables to diners eating in

Alternatives: A local senior center will also be providing transport to their facility several miles away to alleviate some of traffic in the restaurant

The battle between the pensioners 
and McDonald's had escalated over the past few months with the police 
receiving four 911 calls since November about the group.

Some customers, with nowhere to sit, asked for refunds on their meals.

A police source told MailOnline that people usually leave when asked by officers without any problems.

However the defiant patrons admit that they just take a walk around the block and come back in again. 

The elderly patrons return to the McDonald's because they enjoy the long opening hours and find it convenient, patrons said today

The McDonald's in Flushing is the popular hang-out spot for some of the elderly Korean community in the area

Police
 could prosecute patrons for trespassing if they refused to leave and 
the restaurant requested, but hope the matter could be worked out before
 that stage.

Sun Kim, 64, who was enjoying a 
coffee, fries and reading newspapers with a group of six friends in 
McDonald's last week, told MailOnline that she understood it was bad for business 
but that they needed a place to go.

She
 said: 'It is open so early and stays open until after dark when it's 
late. It's warm and the old people like to have a place to meet and talk
 together.'

The conflict between management and the seniors may also be cultural, since coffee shops in Korea don't have seating limits and they are considered places to meet with others to socialize.

Local people admit they bypass the location - which only has around ten booths and a few counter places - because there are never any seats.

Lynn
 Hall, who was pushing an elderly woman in wheelchair whom she cares 
for, said they head to a McDonald's further away because it is always so
 busy.

She says: 'Some people sit there all day long and and there's no room for the wheelchair.'

Flushing
 resident Miriam said: 'I think that place must do no business. People 
go there to read the  newspaper. I go shopping for two, three hours and 
it's always the same people sitting in the same places when I return.'

The elderly people sometimes alternate with a Burger 
King nearby on Northern Boulevard which has more space and community 
boards inside for customers in English, Chinese and Korean.

Flushing Senior Center offers the Korean community breakfast and lunch daily. They have even started offering coffee for 25c to ease the McDonald's battle
