Struggling to cope: Model Samantha Harris at an event at Sydney's Botanic Gardens just two days after her fiance was jailed for four years

Luke Hunt, 28, had been driving 35 km/h over the speed limit when he ran a red light in Narweena, NSW

‘It’s been a very tough few days and I really can’t talk about it,’ Ms Harris swallowed. ‘It’s just been really tough.’

‘She’s still really upset, she just can’t talk about it,’ said her publicist.

The model, a Priceline and David Jones ambassador, was more forthcoming about the bullying she experienced growing up, revealing she never felt like she fit in because of her height and her big lips.

‘It’s quite hard for young girls when they stand out and look different and that was me,’ she said.

‘I had big lips when I was little and obviously still do and that was one of the things I didn’t know how to feel about because none of my friends had lips like me and that made me self-conscious and nervous.

Ms Harris did not attend court for the sentencing of her fiance. Hunt defended her lack of appearance, saying she was avoiding the attention of media: 'She is very upset, she can't handle it nowadays,' he said

‘Kids are kids, some kids aren’t very nice. You get the occasional remark which is hurtful but now that I look back, I think I’ve done quite well with these so-called big lips.’

Ms Harris had not attended court on Wednesday when Hunt, a 28-year-old builder from Queensland, was sentenced after he pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving.

When asked by the judge why Harris had not been present at his sentencing, The Daily Telegraph reported that Hunt answered: 'She is very upset, she can’t handle it nowadays.'

The incident occurred two years ago when Hunt was on his way to the gym in Narweena in Sydney's northern beaches.

He had been trying to change lanes at high speed when his Commodore collided into Mr Lay's Hyundai Lantra at the intersection of Warringah Rd and Alfred St, Narraweena. Hunt's car then slammed into a tree.

Judge Colin Charteris heard Hunt had been doing 95km/h in a 60km/h zone, Mr Lay, a father of seven and grandfather of 16, died in hospital.  

The 23-year-old still find is too difficult to discuss the event which saw the death of 78-year-old grandfather Kenneth Lay two years ago

The model, who posed alongside X Factor winner Dami Im and Home And Away's Ada Nicodemou, also spoke out about being the victim of bullying, saying she was picked on for her height and lips 

Sentencing at Downing Centre District Court, he said: 'There has been no real account from Hunt to explain why he was driving in such a hurry at the time of the accident. It's completely inexcusable.'

However, the judge accepted Hunt's remorse and acknowledged the 28-year-old tradesman now suffers from depression.

'He wishes he had passed away in the accident ... but his regret cannot remedy what has occurred,' Mr Charteris said.

Harris seems to be trying to move on from the traumatic event, continuing with her work with little mention of her beau

Harris did not seem her perky self at the event which attempted to set a Guinness World Record for the longest selfie chain

Hunt was also heard sobbing an apology to Mr Lay's family, adding: 'I have been in a dark place for a long time.'

Hunt has also been disqualified from driving for six-and-a-half years and will be eligible for parole in 2016.

Outside court, Mr Lay's daughter Christine Scott said there were no winners.

'We're not cruel people, and I hate to see somebody go to jail like that, but you can't do what he did,' she told AAP.

Hunt and Ms Harris, who shot to national fame in a modelling competition held by Girlfriend magazine when she was 14, met in a shopping centre on the Gold Coast when the model was 17. They have been engaged for four years.
