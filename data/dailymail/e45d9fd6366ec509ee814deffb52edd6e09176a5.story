An 85-year-old Japanese man has earned the reputation of being perhaps the world's oldest stalker after making unwanted amorous advances to an 80-year-old great grandmother.

The granddad fell for the octogenarian apple of his eye when they shared a hospital room with his wife, who has since died.

On his release from hospital and later entering the lonely life of an aged widower, Takeo Nitta, from Hashimoto - 250 miles from Tokyo - remembered the granny from the adjoining bed.

Takeo Nitta, 85, was arrested for breaking into a 80-year-old woman's home after he left numerous messages on her answering machine wanting to 'go out'

He started leaving telephone messages on her phone's answering machine to the effect of 'I'm waiting outside your house. Let's go out.'

The unnamed great granny was having nothing of it and complained to the police.

Nitta was warned to stay away from the woman but when he continued with the messages he was given a second warning.

But, the Japan Today website reported, his behaviour escalated to the point that on May 2 he broke into the woman's house.

He has now been arrested and faces charges under Japan's anti-stalking laws. It has not been revealed if he has been detained behind bars.

A police spokesman said the grandfather had largely admitted that he had been making advances to the woman, who has not been named.

The elderly man, from Hashimoto (pictured) in Japan, met the great grandmother in a hospital room she shared with his now deceased wife

The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported last week that the couple had met when Nitta and his now-dead wife shared a hospital room with her.

The website said the number of crimes committed by the elderly in Japan is rocketing because so many people are living longer.

Government figures show the number of criminals aged 65 or older in 2011 had risen six-fold in two decades.

Statistics show that while most crimes by the elderly amount to shoplifting or theft, violent incidents are on the increase.

Now, if the charges against Takeo Nitta are proved, police can open a new file under the heading Octogenarian Stalking.
