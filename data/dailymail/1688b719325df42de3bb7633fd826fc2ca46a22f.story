Prince Charles today intervened in the controversial case of a blogger sentenced to 1,000 lashes in Saudi Arabia as he became the first western royal to meet the country's new ruler.

Welcomed by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, to his private compound, the Al Ergah Palace, the prince diplomatically tackled the international outcry over Raif Badawi.

Mr Badawi was arrested in June 2012 for offences including insulting Islam and disobeying his father - considered a crime in Saudi Arabia - after discussing issues such as greater religious and political tolerance online.

The father-of-three received the first 50 lashes last month and had been expected to receive a further 50 each week, but further beatings have been withheld without explanation.

Before he set off on a six-day tour of the Gulf, Amnesty International urged Charles to seize the opportunity of his visit for 'a frank discussion of human rights.'

And today sources confirmed to the Mail that the heir to the throne had discreetly tackled the subject with Saudi's new king.

Charles chatted for some 20 minutes with King Salman, who acceded the throne following the death of the 90-year-old former ruler, King Abdullah last month, before sitting by his side at a lavish state lunch.

Some 300 VIP guests had been invited in the prince’s honour and the group feasted on more than 25 dishes including Longface Emperor Fish, a whole lamb and Om Ali-Kenafa, a local desert with cream.

Described by one senior British diplomat as ‘providing not just the continuity here, but the continuity that matters’, Charles had the red carpet rolled out for him by every senior member of the kingdom’s ruling royal family.

British ambassador Simon Collis said he was sure that the prince's visit would have a 'significant impact'.

He continued: 'Royal to royal links have a particular value. He arrives as a frequent visitor and somebody with longstanding relationships in place. Any conversation that does happen is not just going to be an exchange of platitudes because they are past that. '

Another official said that Charles was good at raising human rights issues without making the Saudis 'bristle'.

Prince Charles is expected to intervene in the case of a jailed blogger sentenced to 1,000 lashes when he meets the new Saudi king later 

Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, The Minister for the National Guard and one of the late king’s 20 sons, referred to the death of his father which provoked controversy in the UK when the flags at Buckingham palace, Westminster Abbey and Whitehall flew at half-mast.

Within hours of the king dying, Charles was on a private jet to Saudi Arabia to pay his respects.

Prince Miteb said: ‘When you came on the first day after the king died it meant a great deal to us. The family were very grateful to your Government and to the Queen.

‘He [the late king] was always taking about the Queen and her mother.’

Saudi prisoner Raif Badawi, whose case Charles raised with the Saudi king today, ran a website that encouraged Saudis to debate both politics and religion.

His Free Saudi Liberals online forum – which has now been closed – criticised Saudi Arabia's clerics and claimed that a university in the country had become 'a den for terrorists'.

In 2013, after Badawi's wife and children fled to Canada, he was cleared of apostasy, the rejection of Islam, which could have carried a death sentence.

But he was found guilty of 'insulting Islam' and 'going beyond the realm of obedience'.

The father of three received the first 50 lashes on January 9, and he was expected to receive 50 more every week for the following 19 weeks.

Amnesty International say the second 50 lashes have been delayed. It was reported that the wounds had not healed, and his wife said that as a diabetic who suffered from hypertension, he may be unable to physically withstand another flogging.

Protests were held outside Saudi embassies across the world and Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, raised the case with Saudi ambassador Prince Mohammed Bin Nawwaf Bin Abdelaziz last month.

However Amnesty has accused the UK of being 'muzzled' by its commercial and strategic links with the kingdom and of failing to object strongly enough.

Saudi Arabia beheaded a convicted Syrian drug smuggler today, bringing the number of executions in the kingdom this year to 27.

Authorities carried out the sentence against Abdullah Mohammed al-Ahmad al-Anzi for trafficking amphetamine pills, the interior ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.

He was executed in northwestern Jawf region.

The government says it is keen to combat narcotics due to their 'great harm' but the kingdom has faced constant international criticism over its human rights record, including its use of the death penalty.

Anzi was the latest of 27 foreigners and Saudis executed this year, according to a tally.

The Gulf nation executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013, AFP's tally showed.

Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under the kingdom's strict version of Islamic sharia law.

Ambassador Collis was present as Prince Faisal earlier escorted Charles through an assembled Guard of Honour in Royal Terminal of Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport.

The prince and his entourage were served traditional Arabic coffee and dates as part of a traditional welcome, before heading off for a formal bilateral meeting with the Crown Prince followed by his head to head with the king.

Meanwhile Mr Collis described Saudi Arabia as a being 'key strategic partner' in the coalition against ISIS and the fight against terrorism more generally.

He said: 'At the same time as a government we stand for the rights of people everywhere to have freedom of expression and for human rights more generally.

'Against the background of that overall relationship, we have serious concerns about the Raif Badawi case. We have raised that and we will continue to raise that. '

He added of Charles: 'The Prince of Wales is a long standing and frequent visitor to Saudi Arabia he has been been many times.

'I am very much aware as an ambassador, Prince Charles will know most of these people much better than I do. He will be the judge of what he raises and how and when he raises it.

Charles has undertaken his whistle-stop tour of the Gulf states at the request of the Government.

He is accompanied by four of the FCO's most-senior officials, including Director for the Middle East, Edward Oakden, a sign of the significance of his mission in fostering good relations between the UK and the Gulf States.

He arrived in Jordan at the weekend before moving onto Kuwait and will also take in Qatar and the UAE before he leaves.
