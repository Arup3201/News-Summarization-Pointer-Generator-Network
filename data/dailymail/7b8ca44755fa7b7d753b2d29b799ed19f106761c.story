These playful dolphins stole the show when they gatecrashed one of the world's top surfing competitions to ride the waves themselves.

The animals turned up as global surfing legends descended on Jeffreys Bay, South Africa, for the latest stop on the Association of Surfing Professionals world tour.

The 12-day J-Bay Open saw surfers compete for dominance off the shores of the Eastern Cape, famous for its dramatic waves and large numbers of bottlenose dolphins. 

But things took a surprise twist when a school of almost a dozen dolphins set out to show they were the undisputed kings of the sea in these images captured by 62-year-old Stan Blumberg.

'Two surfers were in the water at the time when a few pods of dolphins swam past and a few surfed the waves as they usually do, without breaking the surface,' he said - then they broke through and put on their show.

He added: 'In my 62 years of living at the coast, I have surfed, scuba dived, been a member of a surf lifesaving club and can honestly say that I have never before seen dolphins surf like this before.'

Awe: The Eastern Cape is famous for its prime surfing and schools of bottlenose dolphins, but it's a lucky treat to see both happening at the same time

Breaking with convention: The dolphins swam close to the shore during the J-Bay Open, part of the Association of Surfing Professionals world championship tour

Preparing for their big moment: Photographer Stan Blumberg said he had lived on the coast for 62 years and never seen such an impressive dolphin surfing display

Build-up: Human surfers spend years honing their skills, but things came a little more naturally to these dolphins swimming off the coast of South Africa's Eastern Cape

Catch them if you can! Dolphins are known for their playfulness in the wild, where they play games such as leaping as high as they can out of the water
