Seven men have been arrested in connection with a sexual assault on a 19-year-old woman in Tahrir Square while thousands celebrated the inauguration of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

The arrests come amid growing outrage as a video emerged purportedly showing a woman being stripped naked and attacked. It is not clear whether her attackers were among those arrested for Sunday's violence.

Police were investigating 27 other complaints of sexual harassment against women during Sunday's rallies by tens of thousands of people celebrating al-Sisi's inauguration late into the night, security officials said.

Seven men have been arrested in connection with a sexual assault on a 19-year-old woman during celebrations in Tahrir Square to mark the inauguration of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Celebrations were also taking place in the square when the results of the election were confirmed on June 3

Last week, the Egypt government issued a new law which punishes sexual harassment with at least six months in jail or fines of at least 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($420). Judicial sources said the arrests were made under the new law.

Sexual assault was rampant at demonstrations during and after the 2011 uprising against then-president Hosni Mubarak and is common at large gatherings in Egypt. Local activists and foreign journalists are among those who have been attacked.

Twenty-nine women's rights groups have released a joint statement accusing the government of failing to do enough to address the spiralling outbreak of mob attacks on women. The groups said they had documented more than 250 cases of 'mass sexual rape and mass sexual assaults' from November 2012 to January 2014.

'Combatting that phenomena requires a comprehensive national strategy,' said the statement signed by the women's groups.

In the latest incident, video footage posted on social media purportedly shows a woman completely naked amid a crowd of men, as policemen struggled to escort her out of Tahrir.

The Interior Ministry, in charge of 
police, identified the seven suspects and gave their ages as between 15 
and 49. It said they were arrested for 'harassing several girls' but 
made no mention of the student. A policeman was injured while the seven 
were being arrested, the ministry added.

Police were investigating 27 other complaints of sexual harassment against women during Sunday's rallies by tens of thousands of people celebrating al-Sisi's inauguration late into the night, security officials said. Celebrations were also held in the square when it was confirmed al-Sisi won the election on June 3

Prosecutors are detaining them for four days pending investigations, judicial sources said. Two of the men admitted beating a woman, while five denied any wrongdoing and said the women had provoked them, the sources added.

Authorities investigating other reports of sexual assaults were examining a dozen videos from security cameras or from bystanders who filmed the incidents on their mobile phones, the officials said.

They said the footage suggested organized attacks, with groups of men luring victims away from densely crowded spots before encircling them as they assaulted them. Many brandished knives which they used to threaten victims or against anyone attempting to come to their rescue.

Sexual harassment, high rates of female genital cutting and a surge in violence after the Arab Spring uprisings have made Egypt the worst country in the Arab world to be a woman, a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey showed late last year.

The state news agency MENA reported that the public prosecutor was listening to the statements of victims and suspects, and had ordered forensic examinations for the women.

It said initial investigations revealed that 'criminal elements...had harassed some of the women in the square...in an attempt to spoil the celebrations'.

A U.N. report on women last year said 99.3 percent of women and girls had been subjected to sexual harassment in Egypt, which some analysts say reflects a general rise in violence in Egyptian society over the past half-decade.

Many say Egyptian society as a whole needs to take sexual harassment more seriously.

Further uproar was caused by comments made by a TV anchorwoman during a live report from a correspondent covering the Tahrir celebrations. When a correspondent told the anchorwoman there had been several cases of sexual harassment, she laughed and said it's 'because they are happy.'

The anchorwoman denied Monday that her comment was in response to the harassment incidents.

'I was, along with my guests, commenting on people's joy, not the harassment,' she said on her Facebook page.

The anti-sexual harassment decree issued last week amends Egypt's current laws on the abuse. Those convicted face six months to five years in prison, with the maximum punishment reserved for offenders holding positions of power over their victims, such as when the offender is the woman's boss or is armed.

Repeat offenders would see their sentences doubled, the decree said. Along with the maximum five-year sentence, offenders can be fined up to 5,000 Egyptian pounds, or about $714.
