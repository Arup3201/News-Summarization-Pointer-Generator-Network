Liverpool's year began in imperious style and they claimed 11 straight wins from February to April.

Brendan Rodgers' side headed into May top of the pile and, although coming second in the Barclays Premier League denoted a fine season, the way the title was lost in April and May provided a bitter blow for the club and supporters.

Luis Suarez departed for Barcelona in the summer and the club have floundered since, crashing out of the Champions League at the group stages and hobbling along at home. Sunni Upal reviews the year for Liverpool.

JANUARY

January was all about bouncing back after two defeats in three days in late December by Manchester City and Chelsea saw Liverpool fall from first at Christmas to fifth by New Year. 

A 2-0 win over Hull at Anfield kicked off 2014 on the right note before the SAS (Suarez and Daniel Sturridge) put on a master-class in a 5-3 win at Stoke. Liverpool were fortunate to earn a point against Aston Villa at Anfield, fighting back from 2-0 down having been played off the park in the first half to draw 2-2.

But the month ended perfectly with a 4-0 win over Everton in the Merseyside derby.

FEBRUARY

Kolo Toure’s gaffe at The Hawthorns gifted West Brom a point and saw Liverpool fall eight points behind leaders Arsenal. But they responded by blowing the Gunners off the pitch with a 5-1 victory at Anfield.

The opening 20 minutes was as good a football as Liverpool played all season. That victory proved to be the start of an 11-game winning streak that took the Reds to the brink of the Premier League title.

A 3-2 win away at Fulham thanks to a late Steven Gerrard penalty and a 4-3 win over Swansea at Anfield made it 10 points from 12 in February.

MARCH

March was the month that made Liverpool fans really believe it could be their year. Brendan Rodgers’ side notched up five straight league wins, starting the month with a 3-0 victory at Southampton. 

The 3-0 win at Old Trafford that followed will live long in the memory and it could have been an even wider margin of victory, such was Liverpool’s dominance. Suarez’s hat-trick then led the Reds to a 6-3 win at Cardiff, before a nervy evening at Anfield and a 2-1 win over Sunderland followed. 

A 4-0 drubbing of Tottenham moved Liverpool to the top of the table at the end of the month, setting up two huge clashes in April against Manchester City and Chelsea.

APRIL

Gerrard’s two penalties helped Liverpool overcome a tricky tie at Upton Park before the visit of Manchester City to Anfield. 

It proved to be a memorable afternoon, with Raheem Sterling and Martin Skrtel giving the Reds a 2-0 lead before David Silva and a Glen Johnson own-goal dragged them back. Philippe Coutinho struck the winner, though, in a 3-2 win as Liverpool took a huge step towards the title. 

A 3-2 win at Norwich followed, and then Chelsea came to Anfield in what looked like the last hurdle Liverpool needed to overcome. It proved to be the day the title was lost, with Gerrard’s costly slip letting in Demba Ba to score the opening goal in a 2-0 win for a weakened visiting team.

Liverpool’s title destiny was out of their own hands.

MAY

Liverpool’s title challenge ended on a frantic Monday night in south London. Manchester City were already in the driving seat in the title race, but Rodgers' men could’ve kept the pressure on by winning their last two games.

They looked well on course at Selhurst Park in going 3-0 up against Crystal Palace only to crumble in the closing stages and let Palace in to draw the game 3-3. It was Liverpool's 'Crystanbul' moment and Suarez’s tears on the pitch were the image of the night. He knew his chance to win the Premier League had gone.

A 2-1 win at Newcastle on the final day wasn’t enough to prevent Manchester City from being crowned champions. It was a season that promised so much and ultimately delivered very little. Liverpool came agonisingly close to ending their 24-year wait to win the title.

JUNE 

Arguably one of the most significant moments of Liverpool's year happened thousands of miles away in Brazil.

Suarez, while playing for Uruguay at the World Cup, sank his teeth into Italy's Giorgio Chiellini and provoked a storm of criticism and ultimately led to a four-month ban.

On the home front, Liverpool signed boyhood fan Rickie Lambert and his Southampton team-mate Adam Lallana, who cost £25m.

JULY

It was almost inevitable that Suarez would leave Anfield following the World Cup bite and so it proved.

The Uruguay star swapped Anfield for the Nou Camp and signed for Barcelona for £75m, leaving a massive hole in Liverpool's attack.

At the other end of the pitch, the Reds bought Southampton's Croatia centre half Dejan Lovren for £20m.

AUGUST

A new season began and there was an optimistic feel around Anfield that Liverpool’s new look team could go one better than last season despite the sale of Suarez to Barcelona. 

A new SAS was forming in the shape of Sterling and Sturridge and both of them scored in a 2-1 opening day victory over Southampton. 

After a 3-1 loss at Manchester City, the month ended with Liverpool’s best performance of the season so far as they dismantled Tottenham at White Hart Lane in a 3-0 victory.

They also signed a relatively unknown striker by the name of Mario Balotelli...

SEPTEMBER

News that Sturridge was injured while on England duty rocked Liverpool, and they started the month poorly by losing 1-0 to Aston Villa at Anfield. 

Balotelli then got his first goal for the club as Liverpool laboured past Ludogorets 2-1 in their Champions League return. 

Worryingly, though, the Reds were simply bullied out of a game as they lost 3-1 at West Ham, and Phil Jagielka’s stunning strike in injury time denied them a win in the Merseyside derby that ended 1-1. 

There was also a thrilling penalty shoot-out win over Middlesbrough that Liverpool won 14-13 in the Capital One Cup.

OCTOBER

The month started badly as Liverpool were beaten 1-0 in Basle, and their Champions League campaign was in dire straights when they lost again, 3-0 at Anfield against Real Madrid. 

In the Premier League,Lallana scored his first goal in a much-needed 2-1 win over West Brom and a crazy last few minutes saw Liverpool snatch a 3-2 win at Loftus Road. There was also a frustrating 0-0 draw with Hull at Anfield in which the Reds looked like they lacked ideas in how to break down stoke. 

One positive to end the month, though was a 2-1 win over Swansea in the Capital One Cup.

NOVEMBER

The first half of November saw Liverpool’s season hit rock bottom. They lost four games in a row in all competitions against Newcastle, Real Madrid, Chelsea and Crystal Palace. 

Rodgers decided to rest players at the Bernabeu in a move that was criticised while the collapse at Palace was almost as extraordinary than the one in May. 

A 2-2 draw in Bulgaria against Ludogorets set up a must-win Champions League tie against Basle in December, and the month at least ended well with a 1-0 win over Stoke thanks to Johnson’s late header.

DECEMBER

Liverpool’s Champions League fate was sealed in December as they failed to beat Basle at home. A 1-1 draw was not enough to progress to the knockout rounds as Rodgers’ side crashed out of the tournament. It was a devastating loss, and just as painful as losing 3-0 against Manchester United.

But December has also been a month of many positives with a 3-1 win at Leicester, progress in the Capital One Cup after beating Bournemouth 3-1 in the quarter-finals and a Boxing Day win at Burnley. 

Skrtel’s header in the 97th minute earned Liverpool a 2-2 draw with Arsenal that kept their top four hopes alive going into 2015 and there was then the 1-0 win over Burnley. 

Liverpool need a winning streak in 2015 similar to the 11-game run of last season to push themselves into top-four contention.
