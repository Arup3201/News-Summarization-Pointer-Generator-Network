If you've given up on the New Year’s diet and are reaching for that forbidden chocolate bar, it seems you are not alone.

February is the month when people are most likely to feel  fat, according to research.

It found ten million of us will have broken our healthy living resolutions by the end of today.

And it revealed February –  or ‘Flabruary’ as it has been dubbed – is the time when we feel  unhappiest about our weight and lifestyle, mainly because of the failure to shift those extra post-Christmas pounds.

The poll, for WeightWatchers, found 41 per cent made a New Year’s resolution to lose weight and 35 per cent to eat better.

However, by today 24 per cent – or ten million of us – have broken one or more of our  resolutions. At the same time, 10 per cent are depressed about not keeping pledges.

Nutritionist Lucy Vickers said: 'People 
make resolutions because they want to feel better about themselves but 
end up feeling lower than when they started by setting unrealistic 
goals.

'This is why Weight Watchers is encouraging people to take this second chance by making February 1st the new January 1st.

'(And) to make resolutions they can keep with the right support to help them kick-start a healthier lifestyle and see positive results that last way beyond the start of the year.’
