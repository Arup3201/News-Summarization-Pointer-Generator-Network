The Sydney man who was one of the first hostages to escape the cafe gunman said he has never felt more relieved than when he fell into the arms of heavily armed police on Monday.

John O'Brien, 83, from Maroubra in the city's eastern suburbs, told reporters on Wednesday he is already back playing tennis, a favoured hobby. 

'I have never felt so much relief in my life as when I turned that corner and saw those armed police waiting,' said Mr O'Brien, whose lip trembled with emotion as he thanked Australians for their support.

Wearing a blue blazer, Mr O'Brien bolted out of a door with Lindt staff member Stefan Balafoutis around 3:45pm AEDT.

TV cameras broadcast the terrifying moment the pair burst out of the chocolate cafe, defying the orders of self-styled Sheikh Man Haron Monis, who took customers and staff hostage around 9:30am Monday.

Immediately following the siege, Mr O'Brien had told the ABC the Sheikh had demanded he hold up an Islamic shahada flag against the window - but the elderly man said he was too tired. 

He also reportedly refused to lie on the floor for the gunman, telling him he was 'too old'.  

Today, Mr O'Brien paid his respects to the two hostages who were killed during the siege's bloody end, cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson.

'I offer my sincerest condolences,' he said, adding that his thoughts and prayers were with his fellow hostages, and with his thanks to NSW police involved. 

Out the front of the home where he lives with his wife, Maureen, the freed hostage told the ABC he was planning to play tennis to de-stress today. 

'Just playing tennis at midday, then relaxing and trying to get more sleep,' he was quoted saying. The simple things in life.
