A panhandler takes a vicious beating from a man in a horrifying video uploaded online.

The film, which has more than 3,500 views, shows tree surgeon Joseph Johnson get out of a car and repeatedly punch and kick the man in a sustained attack.

Another man in the background can be heard cheering as the 40-second beating, which took place in Memphis, Tennessee, goes on.

But Mr Johnson says the man is not homeless, once worked for him and stole seven chainsaws from his family business.

Savage: He launches his attack, raining down blows on the cowering panhandler

However, Mr Johnson says the beating was retribution for the theft of seven chainsaws by the man

He told WMC Action News, which tracked him down: 'The man is not homeless, the man used to live with my brother.

'He's a good friend of mine. I own my own tree business, he worked for me for a long time. He stole all of my equipment.'

Mr Johnson says the panhandler stole seven of the chainsaws that he needs to run his family's business and attacking the man was retribution.

The TV station showed the footage to Memphis panhandlers, who were horrified.

'It just messes me up,' said Lori Finley. That's messed up though.'

Mr Johnson does have a criminal history, though his most recent charge was 2008.

Memphis Police have issued an arrest warrant for Mr Johnson for Simple Assault, reports WREG Memphis. 

He told the station it was 'worth it.' 

'I don’t think it was wrong at all because that’s what used to happen. You know? But I don’t…I do agree that it’s against the law. You know what I mean? Probably not legal,Johnson said.
