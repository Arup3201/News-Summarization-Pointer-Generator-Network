Saying the word 'Redskins' on the air isn't obscene or profane - at least not according to the Federal Communications Commission. 

The FCC late Thursday afternoon dismissed a petition that called for one of the team's flagship radio stations not to have its license renewed.

The petition claimed repeated use of the word 'Redskins' violates rules against indecent content.

But the FCC said that the law defines profanity as sexual or excretory in nature - meanings that don't relate to the name of the football team.

Washinton Redskins owner had a win Thursday when the FCC late  dismissed a petition that called for one of the team's flagship radio stations not to have its license renewed

Many Native American and other groups consider 'Redskins' to be a racial slur and have demanded that owner Dan Snyder change the name.

Snyder has vowed to keep it, despite mounting pressure over the past two years.

Thursday's ruling affects the Snyder-owned station WWXX-FM.

A Sports on Earth story from writer Patrick Hruby estimates it could cost anywhere from $10 to $20 million to change the team name, which seems like a reasonable amount compared to the salary of some NFL players.

The petition was filed by George Washington University law professor John Banzhaf, Time reports.

This is one mark in the win column for Snyder over in the raging debate after 50 U.S. Senators asked him to change it this May.

The office was dealt another blow this May when the U.S. patent office cancelled the team trademark, though that ruling is being appealed.
