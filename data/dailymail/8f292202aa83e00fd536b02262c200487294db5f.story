A widow told of her heartbreak today after she sold her home and handed over £105,000 to a smooth-talking conman she fell in love with.

Beverly Healey, 69, fell in love with handyman Jamie Evans, who did odd jobs around her home in Brislington, Bristol, and over two years he persuaded her to hand over money using a string of lies including being beaten by loan sharks, even brandishing bruises to back up his claims.

Ms Healey sold her house and gave him £52,000 from the proceeds to appease loan sharks, leaving her with just £17,000. When she agreed to give him the money, Evans proposed to her before vanishing.

Fell in love with a conman: Beverly Healey gave more than £105,000 to Jamie Evans after she fell in love with him and he persuaded her that he needed money using a string of lies

She now lives day-to-day on her pension in a small flat and her remaining savings of £2,000.

Using the alias James Price, the separated father gained her trust and convinced her he was being pursued by loan sharks and needed money to pay them off.

Ms Healey said: ‘I fell in love, we were planning to spend our life together, at the time the money didn’t matter, I was going to be with him.

‘He had such a way of telling you these stories that you couldn’t help but feel sorry for him. He was very clever.

‘I felt I knew him well and we got on famously. He took me in.

'Unscrupulous': Evans convinced Ms Healey to sell her house (pictured) and she gave him £52,000 of the proceeds to pay loan sharks he claimed were beating him

‘He is a cruel man, a cruel, cruel man. I’m very wary now, especially of males.

‘No words can explain it. I have learned from it and I won’t trust anyone again, ever.’

Evans, 38, appeared before Bristol 
Crown Court last week where he pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud 
and was handed eight months in jail, suspended for a year.

Mrs
Healey met ‘James’ in August 2008 after she was widowed in 2002 when 
her postman husband of 15 years, Norman, died of a stroke, aged 79.

The pair developed a relationship and 
Evans began asking her for money, claiming a transit van he used for 
work  had mysteriously broken and needed to be replaced.

Ms Healey, a retired Crown 
Prosecution executive officer, dutifully handed over £2,000 to help buy a
new van and when that one broke, she handed him the same amount to buy 
another.

Evans, who lived 
on a caravan park in Cardiff, pleaded for money to take his children to 
Disneyland Paris and Ms Healey gave him £7,500.

'Never trust again': Ms Healey said Evans was a 'cruel, cruel man' for his deception and he pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud at Bristol Crown Court

She said: ‘He told me he would like to 
take his three children to Disneyland because he wanted a week away 
without family pressures.

‘I knew by this time how much he owed to
the loan sharks and he told me he would find it very difficult to pay 
me back straight away but because I thought we were going to be together
I told him it didn’t matter about the time, just to pay me as and when 
he could.

Hard lesson: Ms Healey now lives on her pension and her remaining £2,000 of savings

‘I loaned him about £7,500 for the weeks holiday and he got his daughter to ring me to say thank you, I don’t know if that even was his daughter.’

She also gave him £8,000 when he claimed his flat had been burgled and all his possessions stolen.

Evans then began turning up at her house covered in bruises in August 2009 and claimed he had suffered the injuries at the hand of loan sharks who he could no longer afford to pay.

Ms Healey said: ‘I told him that I had given him all my money and that the only money I had left was tied up in the house.

‘He told me that we were going to be together but I said I didn’t want to lose my security and needed time to think.

‘The next time he came back with awful bruises and I said that it couldn’t go on like this, I was worried they were going to kill him, so I put my house up for sale.

‘It sold in three weeks and we got a flat together.’

Despite landing the huge windfall from Ms Healey’s house, Evans continued his deceit and later claimed he had been arrested while on a trip to France and that French police were demanding £8,000 to lessen his sentence.

When he disappeared and she was unable to trace him, she reported him to police in June 2010.

In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Mercer told Evans: ‘You took advantage of Mrs Healey in an unscrupulous, unkind and utterly dishonest way.’

Ms Healey said she was disappointed Evans was not jailed but now wanted to put the past behind her.

She said: ‘I’m just going to get on with my life and put it all behind me. What a way to learn.

‘Don’t be taken in by all the charm, it’s easy to see through it now, I used to read all about these things and think what a silly person, but when it happens to you, you forget all that.

‘I don’t know any evil people and I believed him.’

Evans was sentenced to eight months in jail, suspended for a year, as well as 100 hours of unpaid work and a three-month curfew grounding him from 7pm to 7am.
