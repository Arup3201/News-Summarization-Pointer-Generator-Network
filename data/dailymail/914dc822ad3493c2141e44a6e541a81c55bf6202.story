The Speaker of the Commons John Bercow is to be a prosecution witness during the sex trial of his former deputy, Nigel Evans.

The Mail can reveal that Mr Bercow is on a list of at least ten MPs who will be called to give evidence for the Crown when Evans stands trial next month, accused of nine sex attacks on seven men.

Among the other high-profile politicians who has been asked to testify during the prosecution is the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin – a former Government Chief Whip.

Outspoken Tory backbench MP Sarah Wollaston has also been asked to be a prosecution witness.

Downing Street officials are expected to follow events at the trial very closely with the appearance of Mr Bercow, whose wife Sally is no stranger to publicity, certain to hit the headlines.

According to Whitehall sources, Mr Bercow has been asked to give evidence in person at Preston Crown Court, rather than by video link, for what promises to be an extraordinary courtroom spectacle.

A day after Evans was first charged with a series of sex attacks, Mr Bercow told MPs he was ‘warmly grateful’ to the politician for his three years’ service as a deputy, adding he had been ‘highly competent, fair and good-humoured’.

Evans, the former deputy speaker of the House of Commons, denies all the offences he is accused of.

The 56-year-old openly gay politician, formerly the Conservative MP for the Ribble Valley, Lancashire, and now serving as an independent, faces nine charges including one of rape.

He entered formal not guilty pleas to all the charges during a 17-minute pre-trial hearing at Preston Crown Court last month and is due to go on trial at the same court complex on March 10.

He stood in the glass-panelled dock, hands clasped in front of him, as the indictment was read to him. After hearing each of them, he said: 'Not guilty'.

Evans had previously faced eight charges. But at the hearing last month, an additional charge was added to the indictment.

Mark Heywood, QC, prosecuting, explained that the additional count had been introduced 'because some of the alleged sexual activity is said to taken place before the alleged rape and some after the alleged rape'.

Evans, who was granted a continuation of his bail, denies two counts of indecent assault, six of sexual assault and one of rape.

The rape and two of the sexual assaults relate to a single complainant. All the charges cover the period from 2002 to April 1 last year.

The politician, of Pendleton, near Clitheroe, Lancs, resigned as deputy speaker after being charged on September 10.

He quoted Winston Churchill during an extraordinary Commons speech several hours later.

In a carefully-phrased personal statement, which lasted several minutes, the former Vice chairman of the

Conservative Party explained why he had stepped down as a deputy Commons speaker in the wake of the charges brought against him.

He said: 'Winston Churchill said when you are going through hell, keep going. Sage advice. And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me.'

The MP said his decision to step aside as a Deputy Speaker in the wake of the charges had been the 'most painful thing I have endured in my life'.

He also revealed he had resigned the Tory whip and will stand as an independent MP for his Ribble Valley constituency in Lancashire until after ‘the conclusion of events’.

Evans was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was ‘tired of living a lie’.

He said that since he was first arrested over the sex allegations in May last year, he had received ‘so many hugs, prayers and good wishes’.

‘I was told I would soon see who my real friends are and that has been true,’ he added. ‘But the truth is there have been so many of them - so thank you to my dearest loyal friends, including loyal members of my staff at Westminster and the Ribble Valley.

‘And to you, my colleagues, on all sides of the House who have spoken with me, looked after me and just shown loving attention. Party divisions disappear in times like this and they have, thank you.

‘Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Speaker’s chaplain, and Andrew Tremlett, the canon of Westminster Abbey, have given me superb spiritual guidance which has given me the one thing everyone in this world needs, alongside air, water and food: that is hope.’

Conservative MP Nadine Dorries placed a hand on Evans’s shoulder as he sat down after his statement to a hushed Commons.
