The Masters World Championships Highland Games will take place in Inverness in September and preparations have long been under way for one of the key events: caber tossing.

The Games' organisers have enlisted the help of Danny, an adorable three-year-old Clydesdale horse, who has an integral role to play in the upcoming caber tossing record-breaking attempt.

For the chop: A tree is felled to make one of the cabers that will be used in the record breaking attempt

Danny has been working hard, pulling fallen trees from the Revack Estate in the Scottish Highlands, so that they can be carved into cabers.

All cabers have to meet the regulation length of 14 foot 9 inches and weight of 55 pounds.

Danny and his team will also ensure that the Highland Games Committee have enough cabers to attempt the Guinness Record Breaking attempt.

Only 51 simultaneous tosses are needed for the record to be broken but over 100 have so far been carved. 

Danny then pulls the pieces of wood that will be used during this year's Highland Games to a piling point

The trunks of wood will be carved into cabers of regulation size and weight for the tossing competition

Scotland will see over 100 international competitors during this year's 150th anniversary Games.

The caber-tossing event will take place at the Northern Meeting Park in Inverness on Sunday 14 September. 

Danny's 'guardian', Dave Garman, who helps run the Revack Estate said: 'We need to successfully turn 50 cabers to break the world record. It would be nice to get 150 to mark the 150th anniversary of the Northern Meeting Park - the oldest Highland Games venue in the world – but I can see no reason why we cannot aim for 200.

'Danny and I will be working flat out to prepare as many cabers as the Inverness Highland Games Committee needs to create this world record. It will be a momentous occasion.'

Over 100 competitors from around the globe will attempt to break the caber toss Guinness Record
