Senior judge: Nigel Sweeney QC said it was 'not appropriate' to hand out a whole life sentence

A senior judge who refused to sentence a triple killer to die in prison because of his human rights found himself on a collision course with the Government last night.

Ian McLoughlin, 55, butchered Good Samaritan Graham Buck, 66, while on day release in July from an earlier jail term for murder.

But Mr Justice Sweeney yesterday said it was ‘not appropriate’ to hand out a whole life sentence because of a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decision earlier this year.

The judge also indicated that a second
 killer in an unrelated case, Ukrainian extremist Pavlo Lapshyn, who 
yesterday admitted murdering an elderly Muslim man, would not be given a
 whole life term when he is sentenced on Friday.

His
 comments ignited a row over who decides sentencing policy, and sparked a
 rebuke from Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who said the public 
expected whole life tariffs for  the most serious offenders.

Mr
 Grayling, who is also Lord Chancellor, said: ‘The domestic law on this 
has not changed. We are considering the Government’s response to the 
ECHR’s recent ruling, but this in no way alters that fact and courts 
should continue to impose whole life tariffs where they wish to do so.’

Whitehall
 sources suggested the judge had ‘got it wrong’ by following the letter 
of the Strasbourg ruling before it had been considered by ministers and 
Parliament. In July, the Strasbourg court said ‘life means life’ 
sentences were a breach of Article 3, the protection against inhuman and
 degrading treatment.

At the time, Mr Grayling said the  ruling was a ‘terrible day for British justice’.

Following the judgment, ministers were given six months to decide how they will respond.

Last
 night Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘A toxic mix of Strasbourg case-law 
and the Human Rights Act is infecting our court system, with the result 
that dangerous murderers are being given the chance of release, when we 
should be locking them up and throwing away the key.’

McLoughlin
 killed Mr Buck on the first day he was eligible for day release during a
 25-year sentence for murder. Mr Buck intervened to stop him robbing his
 vulnerable elderly neighbour in their Hertfordshire village.

McLoughlin
 had already served a long sentence for manslaughter after a hammer 
attack on a gay man almost 30 years ago.

Sentencing him at the Old 
Bailey to life in prison, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum 
of 40 years, the judge said: ‘It is incumbent on me to pass a sentence 
that is compliant with the Convention  [on human rights] if I can and it
 is not appropriate to impose a whole life term.’

The European Court of Human Rights ruled in July that life sentences with no possibility of review are inhumane and degrading.

The whole-life tariff applied in the UK to just 48 men and one woman – Rose West – whose crimes courts regard as so heinous they must never be let out.

But three of them – Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore – appealed to Europe, saying their sentences ‘undermined human dignity and destroyed the human spirit’.

And the highest body of the European Court of Human Rights, the Grand Chamber, agreed with them.

It said refusing the 49 any prospect of release amounted to a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture, and 'inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'.

All the killers must now be allowed a review – with the prospect of release if they have been ‘rehabilitated’ and are deemed harmless.

And today the full impact of this ruling was felt as Mr Justice Sweeney said that he was barred from passing a whole life term on triple murderer Ian McLoughlin because of it.

The judge instead ordered that McLouglin serve a minimum of 40 years in prison. 

It
 is believed to be the first time that a multiple killer has escaped a 
whole life term because of the European ruling. The horror attack took 
place within hours of McLoughlin hitching a lift from Springhill Prison,
 near Aylesbury, on  Saturday, July 13, while on unsupervised day 
release from a 25-year sentence for stabbing his landlord to death.

He
 went straight to the house of Francis Cory-Wright, 87, an Old Etonian 
he met in prison two years earlier while Cory-Wright was serving a 
30-month sentence for indecently assaulting a ten-year-old boy.

As
 McLoughlin filled a pillowcase with family heirlooms and cash, his 
victim shouted for help from a window. Mr Buck came over to investigate 
and was confronted by McLoughlin, who dragged him inside the house and 
slashed his throat.

Mr 
Buck’s wife Karen, 55, a nurse, said: ‘To kill him was the most 
senseless, vicious act of violence and cowardice possible. His family 
and friends will never be able to make sense of what happened.’

In
 1984, McLoughlin was jailed for ten years for manslaughter after he 
killed Len Delgatty, 49. In 1992, he was jailed for life, with the 
recommendation that he served 25 years, after stabbing Peter Halls to 
death. This was later reduced to a 14-year minimum term.

Last
 night the Attorney General’s office said the sentence handed to 
McLoughlin had been referred for review on the grounds it was ‘unduly 
lenient’.
