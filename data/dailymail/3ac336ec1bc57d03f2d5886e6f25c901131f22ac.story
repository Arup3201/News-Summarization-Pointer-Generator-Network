Jonnie Peacock's mum Linda is welling up with tears when the Paralympic athlete starts to talk about his meeting with David Beckham.

‘This is the second best day of my life,’ he admitted at the launch of Sainsbury’s Show Your Support campaign for the 2014 School Games. And the first? ‘Meeting David Beckham for the first time.’

Beckham does that to people, inspiring them with his presence and giving them the motivation to go on to achieve great things.

Peacock did that after he met Beckham when he was seven, two years after his right leg was amputated just below the knee after he contracted meningitis.

‘I went to Euro 2000 with my mum soon after I lost my leg and it was a dream come true to meet David Beckham,’ said Peacock, who won gold in the 100 metres at the London 2012 Paralympics. 

‘He pulled out a training top, signed it and I still have it today. It’s probably what made me sport mad.

‘It gave me so much confidence. I had just lost my leg, kids get a bit of bullying and that half an hour with David Beckham will stay with me for the rest of my life. 

'Just the fact he went into that training bag and pulled out his T-shirt. It might be just a small token from him but for me it was such a huge moment.

Inspiration: Peacock said that meeting the England star as a youngster motivated him to get into sport

‘Thinking “Oh my god this guy has just given me his training top, how amazing is that”. Women from down the road were queuing up just to sniff it. I was charging to smell the T-shirt!’

Beckham insists that his parents gave him the grounding, telling him to be polite and mild-mannered as he made his way through life as a professional footballer.

‘My parents instilled it into me,’ he admitted. ‘How inspiring is Jonnie’s story? Whenever I talk to kids I tell them about my experiences, how I wanted to play for my country. 

'I had to work hard because it didn’t always look like I was going to be a person who would go on to be an England captain and to be an ambassador for my country in many different ways.’

Passing it on: Peacock says he is trying to have a similar impact on the next generation of athletes

Peacock’s career took off at the Sainsbury’s School Games, which sees about 1,600 11 to 17-year-olds competing over four days in Manchester this weekend. 

He added: ‘That’s something I like to try to do for people now — after the European championships the other week, I was just getting my medal and this kid wanted my numbers.

‘I couldn’t get it off so I gave him the whole shirt. For him that might be something similar. It’s a big thing for him.’

David Beckham and Jonnie Peacock were taking part in a special motivational session for young athletes competing at this weekend’s Sainsbury’s School Games. Sainsbury’s is committed to helping young people lead healthier, more active lifestyles and has pledged to encourage over 20 million children to enjoy physical activity by 2020.
