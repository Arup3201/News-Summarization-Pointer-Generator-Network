Michael Christian, one of the two Australian royal radio prank hoaxers, quietly slipped back onto the air today after lying low for two months.

Mr Christian and his co-host Mel Greig caused international uproar on December 4 when they pretended to be Prince Charles and the Queen and were put through to the Duchess of Cambridge's ward at the King Edward VII's Hospital.

Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who innocently put the hoax call through, later committed suicide, resulting in the two DJs, who were working on Sydney's 2Day FM, being pulled off the air and an investigation being started by Scotland Yard.

After giving a tearful TV interview 
later, when they expressed their sorrow at the consequences of their 
hoax call, nothing was heard of the pair – until today, when Mr 
Christian's voice was heard on his original radio station, Melbourne's 
FoxFM, which is part of the Southern Cross Austereo network.

The company was quick to deny that it had arranged for Mr Christian to 'sneak' back on air.

'I don't think the organisation was trying to hide anything,' a spokeswoman told Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper.

'His return was never going to be the subject of a bells and whistles-type announcement.'

Nothing has been heard of Miss Greig, 30, and no announcement has been made when, or if, she will return to the air waves.

When the pair gave their TV interview 
in the wake of Miss Saldanha's suicide, Miss Greig appeared to be more 
upset than Mr Christian.

Through her tears she said: 'I remember my first question was "Was she a mother?"

She added: 'There's not a minute that 
goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going
through.

'And the thought we may have played a part in that is 
gut-wrenching.'

Both DJs declared they would be happy to help with any investigation by Scotland Yard.

However, Britain's Crown Prosecution 
Service said earlier this month that there was no evidence to support a 
manslaughter charge.

The network said that while the 
couple's show, Hot 30, had been axed, the company was looking at them 
'returning to work when the time is right in roles that make full use of
their talents'.

Now Mr Christian has made his first 
appearance in the wake of the scandal, continuing with his announcements
without any reference to past events.

Mr Rhys Holleran, the company's chief executive officer, said: 'We are happy to have Michael back on air.

'We have always supported our talent returning to work when appropriate and today marks that occasion for MC.

'We look forward to welcoming Mel Greig back when the time is right.'

Just when that will be remains unknown. She has not been seen in public, nor made any comment, since the tearful TV interview.

Miss Greig said in an interview after the death: 'There’s not a minute that goes by that we don’t think about her family and what they must be going through.'

The DJs spoke of their grief soon after the prank call saying they were 'gutted, shattered and heartbroken'.

In two emotional and often tearful interviews, Mel Greig and Michael Christian offered their apologies to the family of Jacintha Saldanha, but insisted that it had been a 'harmless prank' and that no one could have foreseen the tragedy.

Recounting the phone call in which another member of staff broke the news about the nurse's death, sobbing Miss Greig, 30, said: 'I remember my first question was, “Was she a mother?” ... It was the worst phone call I have ever had in my life.

'There's not a minute that goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going through.

And the thought we may have played a part in that is gut-wrenching.'

Mr Christian, 25, who had joined the Sydney-based radio station only weeks earlier, said: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected.

'Obviously Mel and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what's happened.

'We hope that they [Mrs Saldanha's family] are doing OK and they're getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now.'

Mr Christian and Miss Greig were also believed to have been given bodyguards following the backlash to their prank.
