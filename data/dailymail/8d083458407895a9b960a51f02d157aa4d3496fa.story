The man who shot dead John Lennon outside the Beatle's New York apartment building detailed the intense planning that went into the murder, in a court hearing last week.

Mark Chapman stalked the music legend for months before the shooting, shelling out on tickets to and from his home in Hawaii.

Last week, the now 59-year-old appeared before a board who decided to deny him bail, perhaps in part because he continued to brag about the murder.

When asked why he decided to target Lennon, Chapman said he couldn't resist the fame that would come with the crime.

'That bright light of fame, of infamy, notoriety was there,' he said. 'I couldn't resist it.'

Denied: Mark David Chapman (left, in 2012)shot dead John Lennon (right, in September 1980) on December 8, 1980. He was denied parole for the eighth time at a court hearing last week

'Incredible planning...incredible stalking': At the hearing last week, Chapman bragged about the plotting that went into Lennon's murder. Above, an excerpt of the court transcript

'That bright light of fame': Chapman said he killed Lennon in order to gain notoriety after becoming suicidal. Above, another page of the court transcript

'This wasn't a naive crime': Chapman was even able to convince his suspicious wife that he was only traveling to New York to write a book, and not kill Lennon. Above, a page of the court transcript that details the lead up to the shooting

The court also asked how he was able to financially handle traveling back and forth between Hawaii, where he lived with his wife, and New York where he followed Lennon.

He says they sold a Norman Rockwell painting, and he was supposed to give the money to his father-in-law. Instead, he pocketed the money and used it for his trips to New York.

Chapman went on to talk about the amount of thought that went into the shooting.

He said it took 'incredible planning...incredible stalking' and that it was 'very well thought out'.

He finally decided to carry out the crime in December, 1980, when he told his wife he was travelling to New York to get some space and write a children's book.

She wasn't concerned at all because 'I was very convincing'.

'This wasn't a, you know, naive crime. It was serious, well thought out crime.'

Chapman also boasted about the media attention he continues to receive from the shooting, saying he's still approached for interviews.

'I haven't had an interview in 24 years and believe me they come. It's not my interest anymore at all...

'Believe me I am not interested in any press whatsoever at all, and there has been many times where I could have and very recently too. I won't mention names, but you would be surprised,' he said.

Chapman fired five shots on December 8, 1980, outside the Dakota apartment where Lennon lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side, striking the ex-Beatle four times.

Chapman was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.

He will be eligible again for parole in two years.

The board decided that Chapman should remain imprisoned because there is a 'reasonable probability that [Chapman] would not live and remain at liberty without again violating the law.
