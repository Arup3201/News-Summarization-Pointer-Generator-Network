One month ago, the massively powerful winds, rain, and floodwaters of Superstorm Sandy devastated much of New York and New Jersey, killing 60 in the region and causing more than $62billion in damage.

In the aftermath of the storm, relief groups offered their aid, but many have blasted the Red Cross for being absent in the areas hit hardest by the storm.

Many have slammed the organization for not helping families who needed the most relief and are asking what the Red Cross has done with the $150million in donations it has received.

Lamentable? A Superstorm Sandy volunteer has blasted the Red Cross for its response to Sandy, asking where the $150million in donations has gone

Help: Hundreds who were impacted by Sandy, wait in line for distributions from FEMA and Red Cross on November 19 in Coney Island; the activist said she only saw two Red Cross trucks in the Rockaways in two weeks

Nightmare: A still-running water pipe floods the foundation of a home destroyed by Sandy in Oakwood, Staten Island on November 28

New York-based activist Michelle Manning wrote a piece detailing her experiences volunteering in Sandy’s wake, published by the Daily Beast. What she saw was astounding. 

She wrote that in the first two weeks following the storm, she saw Red Cross vehicles only twice, but had worked in the hard-hit Far Rockaways every day.

Ms Manning said: ‘The first time there were two white vans. Dazzlingly white. (Most of the relief vehicles, including my own, were filthy and battered.

'This has been dirty work.) They weren’t at work. They weren’t handing out supplies. They were waiting for Governor Cuomo. For a photo-op.’

The other time, she said, was when President Obama was visiting the most devastated areas of Staten Island.

The activist wrote that in every case she has seen out in the field, the Red Cross was underprepared and not stocked with necessities.

In one instance, she said, Red Cross workers asked volunteers for water to hand out ‘because they didn’t have any themselves - $150million should buy a few bottles of water.’

'I went to a shelter Monday night after 
the storm. People were coming in with no socks, with no shoes. They were
in desperate need. Their housing was destroyed. They were crying. Where
was the Red Cross?'

-Staten Island president Jim Molinaro, speaking on November 1

But Ms Manning hasn’t been the only one to notice the obvious absence of the relief organization.

In a November 1 press conference, Staten Island Borough President Jim Molinaro called the organization an ‘absolute disgrace.’

He later described his logic: ‘I went to a shelter Monday night after the storm. People were coming in with no socks, with no shoes. They were in desperate need. Their housing was destroyed. They were crying. Where was the Red Cross? 

‘Isn’t that their function? They collect millions of dollars. Whenever there’s a drive in Staten Island, we give openly and honestly. Where are they? Where are they?’

He encouraged residents of Staten Island not to donate to the non-profit, saying, ‘let them get their money elsewhere.’

However, Mr Molinaro spoke on CNN with Anderson Cooper a day later, saying that ‘things are looking up.' He said that more aid was coming, and had spoken with Gov. Cuomo and President Obama over receiving necessary assistance.

Anne Marie Borrego, a spokesperson for the Red Cross, told MailOnline that her organization was indeed on the ground in the days following Sandy.

‘There are some things in the [Daily Beast] piece that are inaccurate. We have been all over the Rockaways, there have been tons of press releases of where we would be, and we alerted local media.’She said that the Red Cross was not contacted for comment before the Beast’s story was published.‘We positioned supplies so we were ready to go in after the storm. We don’t put people or supplies in harm’s way, so once the storm passed; we were able to move supplies and individuals in.

'We had thousands of volunteers on the ground, we were spanning across all five boroughs.’

Ms Borrego said that the Red Cross has already spent $60-$70million of the donated funds for items like blankets and cleaning supplies, and said that they’ve served over 7.5million meals.

Assistance: Cleaning products, food and water are stacked at the Operation: Gut and Pump encampment in the Breezy Point on Wednesday, a month after the storm

She added: ‘For a consistent period of time, we’ve had 5,000 workers and volunteers on the ground.’

According to the organization’s website, the Red Cross responds to some 70,000 natural and man-made disasters each year across the United States.

‘People count on the Red Cross to help them in their darkest hour,’ the site reads. ‘In turn, the support of donors makes it possible for the Red Cross to fulfil its humanitarian mission.’

Among other things, the organization provides food and shelter in the wake of a disaster.The Red Cross was founded by Clara Barton in 1881.

Sandy is being blamed for about $62 billion in damage and other losses in the U.S., the vast majority of it in New York and New Jersey — a number that could likely increase. 

It is the second-costliest storm in U.S. history after 2005's Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, which caused $128 billion in damage in inflation-adjusted dollars. 

Sandy damaged or destroyed homes and businesses, more than 72,000 in New Jersey alone, Gov. Chris Christie said yesterday.

New York is seeking $42 billion in federal aid, including about $9billion for projects to head off damage in future storms.

Meanwhile, New Jersey is seeking nearly $37billion in aid, including $7.4billion for future projects. 

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg met with congressional leaders Wednesday to encourage quick action on storm aid.

A month after the Superstorm, the true power and scope of Sandy has been calculated by the National Hurricane Center.

The organization now says tropical force winds extended 820 miles at their widest, down from an earlier estimate of 1,000 miles.

Sandy's pure kinetic energy for storm surge and wave 'destruction potential' reached a 5.8 on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 0 to 6 scale, the highest measured.

Governments are seeking money to help head off future disasters, as climate scientists continue to predict rising sea levels and the potential for more bad storms. 

In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants electrical transformers in commercial buildings hauled to upper floors; the ability to shutter key tunnels, airports and subways; and to require hospitals to have backup power on high ground instead of on lower floors or in basements.
