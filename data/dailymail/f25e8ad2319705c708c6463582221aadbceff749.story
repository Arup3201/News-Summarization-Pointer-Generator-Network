Standing in a loose circle with hands raised, a group of around five dozen adults recite an oath to be the best adoptive parent in the world. Then, when their word is given, they scramble around the room to find their perfect baby.

Meet the Cabbage Patch Kid collectors, a group of avid fans of the chubby-cheeked Eighties dolls, who assemble at Babyland General Hospital, the birthplace of Cabbage Patch Kids, to snag a limited-edition, hand-stitched newborn.

Babyland General Hospital in Cleveland, Georgia, has been the home of Cabbage Patch Kids since 1978 when Xavier Roberts, a young artist from the area, created the fabric dolls that went on to become a worldwide phenomenon.

Nestled in the foothills of the north Georgia mountains, Babyland General Hospital looks like a nice Southern-style home and offers tours as well as all kinds of 'babies' for 'adoption' to the super fans.

Inside the hospital the patch nurses assists with the delivery of Cabbage Patch Kids beneath the Magic Crystal Tree

But this is not your average toy factory. Inside, Mother Cabbage sits at the base of a Magic Crystal Tree waiting to receive visitors, most of whom are adults who have travelled for hours, if not days, to meet her and hopefully take home a squidgy new addition to their family.

When the crystals at the base of the tree begin to glow and an announcement comes over the loudspeaker that Mother Cabbage is dilated, visitors gather to watch a baby being delivered.

A nurse gives Mother Cabbage a small dose of 'Imagicillin' to help loosen her leaves and a large dose of tender loving care, or TLC, and then leads onlookers in breathing exercises before pulling a naked doll from the leaves. 

The Babyland General Hospital website describes the visitor experience: 'Mother Cabbage is always on display beneath the branches of the Magic Crystal Tree. Pollinated by fanciful Bunnybees®, our magical Cabbage Patch is tended by our Licensed Patch Doctors and Nurses. 

'Babyland General Hospital is the only place in the world where you can witness the birth of a hand-sculpted Cabbage Patch Kid. With thousands of Cabbage Patch Kids throughout the hospital, you are sure to find your perfect match. Take the Oath of Adoption and your new baby will give you unconditional love.' 

Instead of buying the dolls, shoppers pay for an adoption certificate as well as reciting an oath to be the best adoptive parent in the world

Newer hand-stitched babies start at about $225, but older ones such as these three original Eighties dolls held by Dianne Adcock from circa 1980,  can sell for tens of thousands of dollars

Admission to the hospital is free and 'babies' are born throughout the year, but the company also organises extra special collectors events.

At the recent limited edition Appalachian Christmas collection some people had trouble choosing.

'I have to like the face,' collector Wilma Arrington said. 'That's the first thing I look at.'

'And the hairstyle,' her husband, John, added.

'The hair and the outfit, it has to go together,' his wife agreed.

For others, it's a bit more abstract.

'It's the personality and the look of the baby because we come in here, and some draw us to them and some don't,' said Eileen Cancilla, another collector. 'It's the baby that picks us out.'

On this particular day, six called out to Cancilla and her husband, Bob, who travelled from northern California. At home, they have a collection of about 2,500.

Each collector has particular reason for their choice of Cabbage Patch Kid 

And while everyone is clearly focused on getting the baby they want, there's no pushing or shoving or fighting over individual babies — unlike in 1983 when production was overwhelmed by demand for the mass-produced version of the soft dolls and fights over the toys broke out.

'Everybody respects everybody else,' said Rebecca Wagner. 'When one person sees a baby they like, then the other person will back away.'

Wagner has passed her love of Cabbage Patch Kids on to her 24-year-old daughter, Victoria, and the two have more than a thousand dolls. They make the trip from Cleveland, Ohio, to Babyland General several times a year.

Collectors sometimes have a hard time explaining their passion to friends. Bob Cancilla endured a bit of teasing about his hobby before retiring several years ago from his job as a sheriff's lieutenant.

'They used to laugh until they found out how the value is of the older babies,' he said with a chuckle.

Newer hand-stitched babies start at about $225 (about £144), but dolls dating to before the mass-market frenzy can sell for tens of thousands of dollars.

During their trip for the most recent collectors' event in November, the Cancillas also picked up Bartholomew, a baby from 1978 that they'd paid for using 'Time Adopt,' a payment plan for more expensive dolls.

But what keeps these collectors making several trips a year to Babyland General is the tight friendships they've formed with other collectors who share their passion. The Arringtons, who also used to travel from Ohio for the seasonal collector events, now live an hour away.

'The main reason we moved here is because of Babyland,' John Arrington said.

And while they love all the babies in their collections, each collector has a favorite.

For Victoria Wagner, it's a Blackberry Winter edition  from 1980 hand-signed by Cabbage Patch Kid creator Xavier Roberts that she adopted over the summer.

'He's my oldest one and he is so tiny,' she said. 'That's my pride and joy right there.'
