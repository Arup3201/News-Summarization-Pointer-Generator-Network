It may be home to the world's greatest tennis stars but Wimbledon has become more of a red carpet this week.

The annual tennis tournament, which kicked off on Monday in South West London, has drawn in the A-listers day after day.

Today's famous faces included avid tennis fan Pippa Middleton, who looked summertime chic in a floaty monochrome dress, and her brother James.

Look who it is! James and Pippa Middleton, who are avid tennis fans, arrived at Wimbledon today to enjoy the summer sport

The 30-year-old is known for her love of tennis and famously watched Andy Murray lose in the finals two years ago with sister Kate.

Pippa, who sported her new shorter hair style, was in good spirits and showed off her toned and tanned legs in her £324 summer dress, which was clinched in at the waist.

She wore strappy black wedges and carried a £200 Matryoshka clutch, opting to cover up in a £300 tailored white blazer.

Staying true to one of her favourite brands, the author and party planner wore full CH Carolina Herrera with her dress, clutch and blazer all being by the Venezuelan-American fashion who has dressed the likes of Michelle Obama.

Sibling day out: Kate clearly decided to stay at home with baby George while her siblings Pippa and James opted for an afternoon of tennis

She and James took their seats in the Royal box just behind Downton Abbey actress Michelle Dockery.

Other
 notable guests included Prince Frederik and Princess Mary of Denmark, 
Labour party politician Harriet Harman, Olympic triple jumper Jonathan 
Edwards and wife Alison, as well as Robbie and Lynette Federer - Roger’s
 parents.

Retired athlete Denise Lewis also sat
 in the Royal box along with Sir Steve and Lady Redgrave, Lady Susan 
Rowe, Eddie Seaward, a former groundsman who retired in 2012, Canadian 
journalist Clive Thomson and Mr Lloyd and Mrs Soraya Embley.

Liam Payne and Niall Horan may be pop
 royalty but they didn't quite make the cut today and instead sat in the
 crowds flanked by a bodyguard and Niall's cousin Willie Devine.

Today sees Serena Williams play Chanelle Scheepers and Maria Sharapova play Timea Bacsinszky in the ladies singles second round.

It's
 been a busy week for Pippa, who sat down for her first ever TV 
interview yesterday to tell the world 'what it is like to be Pippa'.

Happy to be here: Pippa is known for her love of tennis and once wrote about it for Vanity Fair

Summertime chic: Pippa made the most of the good weather by getting her tanned and toned legs out

Until
 now, the 30-year-old magazine columnist has never spoken publicly on 
her life in the spotlight as sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate 
Middleton - or that bridesmaid's dress which brought her so much 
attention at the Royal Wedding in 2011.  

Miss
 Middleton was interviewed by Today's Matt Lauer who had flown to London
 to speak with her for a two-part segment to be aired on Monday and 
Tuesday.

She appeared briefly on camera with Lauer on Wednesday as the pair had just finished taping the interview.

It was revealed today that the sister of the Duchess of Cambridge is allegedly being 
offered a correspondent's job with NBC following her first ever TV 
interview.

In good spirits: Pippa, who gave her first ever TV interview yesterday, smiled broadly and giggled as she made her way into Wimbledon

She's been busy! The party-planner, who looked immaculate with pared down make-up and a glossy blow-dry, recently completed a marathon, 3,000 mile cycle across the U.S. with her brother James

Smart attire: Pippa looked on-trend in a floaty white dress and James was suited and booted in a blue and red suit combo

Sources told the New York Post
 that NBC has been after an interview with Pippa for a while and is set 
to offer her a correspondent's role, appearing in special reports.

It is not thought that Prince William's sister-in-law would report on the Royal Family as the subject is deemed off-limits.

In
2012, it was reported that NBC would offer Pippa, a freelance writer 
and party planner, $600,000 to be a royal correspondent but this was 
denied by the network.

A source told the Post: 'Pippa could do reports based on her party planning book or her charity work.'

Doing her part: Pippa, James and five other men had set off from California last week on the Race Across America with the aim of crossing 12 states to raise money for charity

Look at those locks! Pippa showed off her shorter new hairstyle as she attended the tennis today

It's been a busy few weeks for the
 party-planner, who today looked immaculate with pared down make-up and a 
glossy blow-dry. She recently completed a marathon, 3,000 mile cycle across 
the U.S. with her brother James.

The siblings and five other men had 
set off from California last week on the Race Across America with the 
aim of crossing 12 states to raise money for charity.

They
cycled through California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, 
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland.

After finishing, Pippa, who is dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, described the experience as 'brilliant'.

Asked
 if she had suffered saddle sores, she laughed and said: 'It wasn't too 
bad. I think it was because I chose a particularly comfy saddle.'

On the box: Pippa Middleton dressed casually for her 
interview on Wednesday with Today's Matt Lauer in a low-cut silky blouse
 and skinny jeans. She was speaking for the first time on camera on what
 it's like to live life in the royal spotlight

Challenges
 don't stop there for the Celebrate author - she is soon to be on her 
way to Istanbul to take on the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Race, a 6.5km
 historical swim that crosses from Europe to Asia.

Miss
 Middleton has been keeping busy since being dropped by her American 
publisher Viking Press after her party-planning book Celebrate sold just
 18,000 copies. 

It was announced in May that Pippa had been dropped as a columnist for The Daily Telegraph after just six months.

She still writes for Vanity Fair and is associated with the supermarket Waitrose.
