Instagram is known for its pictures of coffee art and 'creative' images of iconic landmarks, but a new video shows how similar we really are.

The video, which is composed of 852 separate photographs using the Instagram app, demonstrates that when it comes to our supposedly arty photo compositions, we are not as original as we would like to think.

Created by Netherlands-based art director Thomas Jullien, the video includes images of popular Instagram subjects, such as iconic landmarks such as the Empire State Building, the wings of an airplane and sunsets as well as everyday objects like the shoes on our feet.

The video is composed of 852 separate photographs taken by 852 different Instagram users and includes every day objects like shoes - which a number of users think creates an arty photograph

Instagram is known for 'arty' versions of everyday objects such as attractive cups of coffee and lets people experience life from another individual's perspective

‘Instagram is an incredible resource for all kinds of images,’ he told The Verge.

‘I wanted to create structure out of this chaos,’ he added.

To make the film, he collected 852 photos of popular Instagram subjects and cleverly placed them together so that people can approach the Arc de Triomphe through the photos or enjoy different views of the Statue of Liberty, taken through Instagram’s filters.
