Three men who raided 45 homes across the South East of England and stole £25,000 from elderly people in just six months have been jailed. 

Patrick Cawley, his brother John Cawley and James Boyle pretended to be police officers to trick their way into the pensioners' homes. 

In all cases they would flash a fake police warrant card before telling their victims they had arrested someone for a burglary in the area and that they needed to check if anything had been stolen from their homes.

Patrick Cawley and his brother John Cawley have both been jailed after carrying out a string of burglaries

While the elderly person was distracted, one of the men would rifle through their belongings and steal cash and valuables.

The con artists targeted vulnerable people in their 80s and 90s who lived alone and often suffered from health issues. Their oldest victims were two men aged 99.

Hertfordshire Police were forced to launch Operation Manhunt which was led by a specialist unit set up to investigate distraction burglary and crimes against the elderly. 

Between January 2012 and July 2012, more than £25,000 was stolen from victims in Hertfordshire, Essex, Warwickshire, London, Surrey, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire. 

James Boyle was sentenced to eight years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit distraction burglary

The men were finally caught in July 2012 trying to escape from a home in Waltham Cross after a neighbour called police when she saw the burglars acting suspiciously.

They were jailed at St Albans Crown Court.

Patrick Cawley, 54, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit distraction burglary and was sentenced to six years eight months imprisonment.

He was also issued with an Asbo which stops him from being in the same company as James Boyle or John Cawley.

John Cawley, 51, of Kings Cross Road, in London, was sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment after pleading guilty to commit distraction burglary and was handed an Asbo.

James Boyle, 39, of Tookey Close, Harrow, north-west London, was sentenced to eight years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit distraction burglary and was given an Asbo.

Speaking after the case one of his victims, who wished not to be named, said: 'The burglary destroyed my confidence.

'I thought they had come to my door to tell me bad news about my son and of course once they’d got in that was it. 

'It destroys your confidence and it makes you nervous, I don’t know who to trust. I keep the chain on the door now. I do appreciate the support I have had from the police.'

The three men were sentenced at St Albans Crown Court after raiding 45 homes in the South East of England stealing £25,000 from elderly people

Detective Sergeant Mark Clawson, from Operation Manhunt, said: 'These men thought they were untouchable and thought that by travelling the country they would evade police, but they were wrong.

'By the time of their arrest we had already linked the majority of their crimes and were close to identifying them.

'These ruthless criminals left a trail of destruction behind them, often leaving their victims feeling extremely vulnerable and unable to continue living independently at home.

'In some cases the victims’ health has severely deteriorated as a direct result of the incident.'
