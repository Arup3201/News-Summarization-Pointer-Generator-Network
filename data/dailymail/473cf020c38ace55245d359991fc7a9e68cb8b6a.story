Nicki Allwright died after her Mitsubishi sedam hit a tree on Gawler-One Tree Hill Road at Yattalunga

An outpouring of condolences have flooded social media for a family of a teenage girl who was killed after she swerved to miss a duck in Adelaide's north.

University student Nicki Allwright died after her Mitsubishi sedan hit a tree on Gawler-One Tree Hill Road at Yattalunga on Friday.

The horrific accident came just two days before she and her family were planning to jet off on a 10-day holiday to Bali.

Ms Allwright - who was studying human movement at the University of South Australia - was eagerly counting down the days to the Indonesian island getaway.

'We've had a countdown going - 100 days, 80 days, 60 days and the last fortnight she was so excited, saying, "Bali, Bali" all the time,' the 19-year-old's mother, Marion, told The Advertiser.

Mrs Allwright said her daughter was loved by all and shared a special bond with her 21-year-old sister, Sam.

'Nicki just loved her family, as we loved her,' she said.

'She loved being with Sam... they just adored each other. It's just so tragic — everybody just loved her.'

Ms Allwright's siblings - 26-year-old Joel and Sam - and boyfriend of three years, George Blackett, have paid tribute to 'beautiful smiley Nicki' by changing their profile pictures to a photo of themselves and the teenager. 

The touching gesture sparked an outpouring of condolences for the family.

'Your gorgeous little sister [was] a very welcome visitor at our house. Always with a smile on her face - gentle and kind, but gone too soon,' one friend wrote on Facebook.

Another wrote: 'We are all in shock and disbelief, beautiful smiley Nicki. Sending you, Sam, your mum, dad and the whole family so much love xx.'

Ms Allwright's parents have also called for the speed limit on Gawler-One Tree Hill Road to be lowered to 80km/h from 100km/h.

Alan and Marion Allwright said too many young people had done along that stretch of road.
