Relatives of soldiers killed fighting in Iraq today began the latest phase of their fight for the right to launch damages claims against the Government.

The parents of Lance Corporal Kirk Redpath and Private Phillip Hewett want to sue for negligence and to make claims under human rights legislation, after their sons died in separate incidents when Snatch Land Rovers they travelled in were blown up.

They say the MoD failed to provide armoured vehicles or equipment which could have saved lives and should pay compensation.

But the MoD says decisions about battlefield equipment are for politicians and military commanders.

The
Supreme Court began hearing arguments from lawyers representing 
relatives and counter-arguments from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) at a 
hearing in London.

Judges in the Court of Appeal and in the High Court have already considered the issues.

In
October 2012, appeal judges agreed with the High Court judge's verdict 
which said relatives could bring negligence claims but not claims under 
human rights legislation.

A panel of seven Supreme Court justices is expected to analyse arguments over the next four days.

Lawyers
today began by outlining arguments relating to human rights legislation
and are due to debate negligence issues later in the week.

If given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court, relatives would be entitled to launch damages claims in the High Court.

Families
started legal action as a result of the deaths of a number of British 
soldiers following the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

A
Supreme Court spokesman said the case centred on soldiers killed in an 
explosion while travelling in Snatch Land Rovers and on soldiers killed 
and injured in a friendly-fire incident while travelling in a Challenger
II tank.

He said it was alleged that the MoD:

The spokesman said justices would analyse three central legal issues:

A group of families started legal action as a result of the deaths of a number of soldiers, judges have heard.

Lawyers
representing relatives say Corporal Stephen Allbutt, 35, of Sneyd 
Green, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was killed in a 'friendly fire' 
incident in March 2003.

He 
died after a Challenger II tank was hit by another Challenger II tank. 
Trooper David Clarke, 19, of Littleworth, Staffordshire, also died 
during the incident.

And 
soldiers Dan Twiddy, of Stamford, Lincolnshire, and Andy Julien, of 
Bolton, Greater Manchester, were badly hurt, say lawyers.

Private Phillip Hewett, 21, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, died in July 2005 after a Snatch Land Rover was blown up.

Similar
explosions claimed the lives of Private Lee Ellis, 23, of Wythenshawe, 
Greater Manchester, in February 2006, and Lance Corporal Kirk Redpath, 
22, of Romford, Essex, in August 2007, lawyers say.

Several relatives were in court for the start of todayâ€™s hearing. Justices are expected to reserve judgment and deliver a ruling later in the year.

complaints of negligence are covered by the doctrine of combat immunity
