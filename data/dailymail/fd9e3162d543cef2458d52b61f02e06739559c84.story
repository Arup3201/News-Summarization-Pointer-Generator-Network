New Zealand broadcaster TV3 has been banned from filming John Banks' trial after it breached media guidelines by recording the MP pulling something from his ear and eating it.

The footage was aired during a 6pm news bulletin last Thursday where it showed the Epsom MP using his finger to pick something out of his ear then putting it in his mouth as he faced Auckland's High Court.

Justice Edwin Wylie summoned the TV station's senior management to court on Monday afternoon, saying the clip appeared to expose the MP to 'ridicule and derision'.

TV3 lawyer Clare Bradley admitted the footage, shot in the first 15 minutes of the trial when it resumed on Thursday afternoon, was a 'bad judgement call' reported Stuff.co.nz.

But she argued that it was aired to display Banks' reaction to his police interview played to the court.

Ms Bradley then apologised to Banks and the court and added that TV3 would apologise during tonight's 6pm news bulletin.

Banks is charged with knowingly filing a false electoral return after his failed 2010 Auckland mayoral bid.

The crown alleges that Banks declared $65,000 in donations from Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom and Auckland casino SkyCity as anonymous gifts.

Last week, before his first court appearance, he was showered with mud outside the court by angry protester and anti-royalist Sam Bracanov.

The disgruntled 78-year-old yelled out to the politician, called him a bastard, accused him of stealing his $8000 before he emptied a bucket of mud over the politician who was dressed in a suit.

Banks' trial continues.
