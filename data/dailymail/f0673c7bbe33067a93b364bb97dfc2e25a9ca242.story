Since his chiseled, blue-eyed mugshot was posted online, he has become an object of lust for women across the world.

Now, convicted felon Jeremy Meeks has reportedly signed a $30,000 modelling contract.

The 30-year-old, who is facing 11 felon charges including illegal gun possession and gun crime, was offered the contract by Blaze Modelz in Los Angeles, according to TMZ.

The agency, based in Santa Monica, claims it can book him for runway jobs with high-end fashion houses - such as Versace and Armani - which could see him earn thousands of dollars a month.

It also believes Meeks's gangland tattoos could help his modelling aspirations, including his teardrop tattoo, which it considers 'edgy and sexy'.

The criminal is reportedly represented by Hollywood talent agent, Gina Rodriguez, a former porn star who has represented the likes of 'Octomum' Nadya Suleman and 'Teen Mom' star Farrah Abraham.

But despite signing the contract, it is unlikely that he will be to be taking to the catwalk anytime soon.

Meeks, from Stockton, California, is 
currently being held on $900,000 bail with a potentially lengthy prison 
sentence ahead of him if convicted.

Speaking
 to Fox News, Ms Rodriguez said she hoped to secure a number of 
entertainment deals, such as a reality television show, for the alleged gangster in a 
bid to 'help him turn his life around'.

'Everybody
 has a story, and I, of all people, know that,' she said. 'If this was a
 different situation, like if someone was actually hurt or there was 
violence involved, I definitely would not be taking him on.

'But we don’t know Jeremy’s full story yet, and I don’t feel like he got a fair break.'

Meeks
 became an internet sensation last month after his striking mugshot was 
posted on the Stockton Police Department’s Facebook page.

The
 image, which features the felon gazing into the camera with steely-blue
 eyes, full lips and stubble, has so far been 'liked' by more than 
100,000 people and shared over 12,000 times.

But
 the married father himself, who was arrested last month when police allegedly found a pistol in his trunk, has
 a much less desirable rap sheet.

For
 a decade, he has been in and out of courtrooms in California and 
Washington for crimes including resisting arrest, faking his identity 
and grand theft, for which he served two years.

Meeks is due to appear before court again on July 8.
