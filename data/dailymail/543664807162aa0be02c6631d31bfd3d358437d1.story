Andrew Darling was last seen at the Corella Place facility in Ararat, Victoria shortly after 2.30am before he left the facility on foot

A manhunt is underway after a child rapist took off his tracking device and escaped from a correctional facility yesterday morning.

Andrew Darling was last seen at the Corella Place facility in Ararat, Victoria shortly after 2.30am before he left the facility on foot.

Corella Place - nicknamed the 'Village of the Damned' - is a village-style complex which houses child sex offenders and rapists who have finished serving their prison sentences but are considered unacceptable risks to the community.

Police searched the facility and found the man's tracking device, but not the man.

Darling served nine years in prison for raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000.

He assaulted the girl in her bed after breaking into her family’s home to commit a burglary.

He was released from Port Phillip Prison in May 2009 but went missing from his Ararat home the day after he was released, breaking his parole and prompting a police search.

Police are urging rural landowners in the Ararat area to remain vigilant around sheds and outhouses on their properties and to report anything suspicious to police.
