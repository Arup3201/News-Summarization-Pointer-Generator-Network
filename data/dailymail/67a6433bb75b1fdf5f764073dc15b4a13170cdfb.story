A Philadelphia woman known as 'the Black Madam' performed deadly cosmetic surgery on a London dancer in an airport hotel room - then used Krazy Glue to close the wounds, a court was told.

A judge upheld a third-degree murder charge against Padge Gordon after hearing that the client then went into respiratory distress.

The victim's friend, Theresa Gyamfi, testified about getting silicone injections to enlarge their buttocks in February 2011.

She said that Gordon gave them the injections in their room at the Hampton Inn, and then left when 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi started having trouble breathing.

Pumping: Padge Victoria Windslowe, 42, also known as the 'Black Madam,' stood trial today on allegations she administered illegal buttock-injections using silicone from Thailand and Krazy Glue

The Londoners had no contact 
information for the woman, who they had met through an intermediary 
online and knew only as 'Lillian'.

Gyamfi, 22, said they had had the same procedure done by Gordon at the hotel months earlier and had no problems.

They then came back for a 'touch-up.'
But Aderotimi had trouble breathing almost immediately after the second
procedure, Gyamfi said.

Aderotimi died at a hospital hours later.

Gordon, who remains in jail on 
$750,000 bond, looked down at the defense table when Gyamfi described 
learning of her friend's death and viewing the body at the hospital.

Delaware County Medical Examiner 
Frederic Hellman testified that the industrial-grade silicone went into 
the woman's blood, liver, lungs and brain. He said Aderotimi died of a 
pulmonary embolism.

Defense lawyer Christopher Mannix 
said he plans to challenge those medical conclusions at trial, along 
with allegations his client performed the injections.

The 42-year-old Gordon, also known as Padge Windslowe, is also charged with practicing medicine without a license.

Police believe Gordon has performed 
at least 14 cosmetic surgeries, moving locations and using different 
names to avoid detection.

They investigated Aderotimi's death 
for 18 months, with help from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 
before filing the murder charges.

In the interim, Gordon was charged 
with aggravated assault for allegedly injuring an exotic dancer at a New
Year's Eve 2011 'pumping party' in Philadelphia, when she allegedly 
injected a group of dancers on a dining room table.

injuring an exotic dancer who spent two weeks in the hospital after she 
was injected with silicone and Krazy Glue in a similar procedure

The injured woman spent two weeks in 
the hospital with respiratory problems, after silicone particles 
attached to her lungs were too small to remove surgically, her doctor 
has said.

In court Wednesday, Gyamfi explained why she and her childhood friend traveled to the U.S.

'We basically came here to get injections to enhance our figures,' she said.

They also were celebrating 
Aderotimi's upcoming birthday on the second trip. They paid Gordon about
$2,000 each on the first trip and $1,800 on the second trip for the 
injections.

Gordon arrived at the hotel room on 
February 7, 2011, took needles from a bag and silicone from a jug to 
enlarge the women's buttocks, and then closed the wounds with cotton 
balls and glue, Gyamfi testified.

Gordon left the hotel after Aderotimi became ill - and told them to call an ambulance if she didn't get better, Gyamfi said.

Gyamfi said she and her friend 
thought Gordon was a nurse. But Mannix questioned whether they really 
thought they were signing up for a legal procedure.

Third-degree murder carries a potential 20- to 40-year sentence in Pennsylvania.

'She took a product meant for 
industry and food grain and she injected it into a young woman who was 
otherwise healthy, at age 20 ... who then died,' Assistant District 
Attorney Bridget Kirn said.

'That is ... clear, clear evidence of malice, and disregard of the known and unknown risks she caused to other unknown women.'
