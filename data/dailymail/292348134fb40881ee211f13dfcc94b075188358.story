A plane advertisement that showed a swastika flew over New York beaches Saturday.

The advert, seen in both Coney Island and Long Island, was sponsored by the International Raelian Movement, according to CBSNewYork.

The banner shows a peace symbol and a heart symbol being added together, 'equaling' a swastika. Local media have also reported on a different banner, which shows a swastika being added with a peace sign, 'equaling' love.

Message: Proswastika.org flew billboards over New York beaches on Saturday as part of its PR campaign

The movement's believers, called Raelians, believe that an alien race called the Elohim contacted a man named Claude Varilhon in 1973 - now known as the prophet Rael - and told him they created life on Earth.

The website listed in the banner, proswastika.org, said in a release Saturday's event was part of a campaign called Swastika Rehabilitation Week that included events around the world.

'[The swastika] is still readily seen in NYC subway stations and museums, in the old U.S. mint, at the Garfield Monument, and in Native American artwork,' Thomas Kaenzig said in the release.

'There's even a town in upstate New York that was named "Swastika" after gold was found there a century ag,' he added. 'And although most people in the West don’t realize it, the swastika is still a revered symbol for billions of Asians, for whom it signifies good luck and good will.'

Councilman Mark Treyger told the New York Daily News 'It’s a very chilling image, in light of the fact that southern Brooklyn has the largest remaining number of World War II and Holocaust survivors.'

Long Island resident David Bellmore also criticized the advertisement when speaking to Newsday.

'I think the concept of rehabilitating the swastika is either the most naive thing I have ever heard or is a thinly veiled anti-Semitic statement,' he told the website. 'You can't rehabilitate something that elicits such strong feelings.'
