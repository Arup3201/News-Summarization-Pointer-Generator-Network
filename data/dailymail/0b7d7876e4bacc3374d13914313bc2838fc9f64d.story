Dredging up the past: Dan Patrick is in the lead for the Republican Lt Governor's race but is now dealing with the revelation that he was treated for depression in the 1980s

A state senator in Texas whose medical history was released amid a dirty campaign for lieutenant governor has admitted that he was checked into a psychiatric hospital for treatment.

State senator Dan Patrick's team has released a statement saying that he was treated for mild depression and diagnosed with a chemical imbalance in the early 1980s.

The confirmation comes as Patrick's campaign accuses their opponent, David Dewhurst, of leaking records of a deposition where Patrick admits to his stay in the psychiatric hospital.

In the deposition, Patrick claimed that he was not at Spring Shadows Glen Psychiatric Hospital for psychiatric or emotional problems but 'for rest'.

He was later admitted to Memorial City Hospital in Houston and was treated for 'rest, fatigue, exhaustion,' according to local station WFAA.

Patrick also confirmed that he took an antidepressant called Imipramine for a few years in the 1980s to treat the chemical imbalance.

The deposition dates back to 1989, but does not give specific dates of when Patrick's treatment occurred.

His testimony was part of a 1987 slander lawsuit Patrick filed against the Houston Post newspaper, which no longer exists.

'This has not been a secret; for years on his radio station, he has regularly talked about depression and discussed the importance of early treatment when dealing with depression,' campaign spokesman Allen Blakemore said in the statement released to The Houston Chronicle.

Playing dirty: Incumbent Lt Governor David Dewhurst reportedly did not release the information but he doesn't pretend not to benefit from the questions about his opponent's mental health

'He has done this to help others and remove any social stigma for those who seek or are considering seeking treatment. He has conducted several interviews with Texas journalists on the subject. None felt inclined to write the story.'

Patrick, a former radio host, and Dewhurst are both vying for the Republican nomination for the state's second-in-command.

Dewhurst is the incumbent but Patrick beat him in the party primary in early March, finishing ahead by more than 10 points.

For his part, Dewhurst did little to tamper the speculation that he was somehow involved in the release of the deposition- or at least that he benefitted from the information being public.

Big race: Texan voters will decide which of the four candidates (including Dewhurst at left and Patrick at right) will be the Republican Lt Gov nominee (all four candidates seen at a May 7 debate)

'My heart goes out to Dan and his family for what they've endured while coping with his condition,' he said in a statement through a spokesman on Thursday.

The Houston Chronicle reports that Jerry Patterson, the departing commissioner of Texas' General Land Office, was the one to release the information to the San Antonio Express-News.

The run-off vote will be held on May 27.
