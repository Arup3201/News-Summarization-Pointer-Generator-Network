You've read the book, now you can wear the underwear as the official Fifty Shades of Grey lingerie collection is unveiled.

The range includes sexy bra and knicker sets for women and Christian Grey inspired boxers for men.

British lingerie company BlueBella teamed up with writer E L James to create the collection taking inspiration from her bestselling erotic novels.

In brief: The 50 Shades underwear features phrases from the books such as 'oh my!' and 'laters baby'

Gift sets feature some of 
the book's most memorable catchphrases  embroidered into the fabric such as 'laters baby' and 'You. Are. Mine.'

There's also baby doll sets, detailed lace button-up briefs and bra and knicker 
sets with detachable silk satin ties.

The collection will be debuted at the Moda Lingerie & Swimwear Show at the NEC Birmingham in August and will then go on sale with items ranging in price from £12 to £40.

Not just grey shades: The bra and knicker sets will go on sale next month with prices from £12

Sexy: Some of the lingerie will feature detachable silk ties

Emily Bendell, chief executive and founder of BlueBella, said: 'The 'Fifty Shades effect' has benefited 
our business and the books have played a significant role in shifting 
perceptions of female sensuality.

'This is core to our vision too, so we 
feel this is a perfect partnership.'

BlueBella have launched the first collection this summer in the hope it will become a must-have stocking filler at Christmas.

A second collection will hit the shops next summer to coincide with the launch of the anticipated film adaptation.

BlueBella was founded in 2005 by Oxford graduate Bendell, with a mission to inspire female confidence and break outdated British attitudes to sex and sensuality.

She wanted to create seductive fashion lingerie and sensual products, designed by women, for women.

She added: 'As we await the release of the Fifty Shades of Grey film, and a new wave of excitement surrounding the erotic phenomenon reaches fever pitch, we are thrilled to be developing the lingerie and underwear collections that will coincide with both the run-up to and launch of the film.'
