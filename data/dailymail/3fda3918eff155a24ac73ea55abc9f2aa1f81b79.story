A drinker caught with a stun gun disguised as a mobile phone claims he stole it from a nightclub and only realised it was a weapon when it started 'crackling', a court heard today.

David Thompson, 35, told Stonehaven Sheriff Court in Aberdeen he had swiped the modified mobile in the Adelphi area of the city centre and left immediately.

But said when he pushed buttons to try can call his girlfriend the phone started 'crackling' and 'tingling'.

Thompson, who appeared from custody at HM Aberdeen, was given a five year minimum jail term for possession of a firearm.

He claimed three men approached him saying the stun gun belonged to them and asked to have it back.

Police were then called after one of the men allegedly assaulted Thompson during the incident on November 21 last year.

He was later charged with being in possession of a stun gun after the device was recovered at Grampian Police headquarters.

Thompson admitted the offence when he appeared in court in February.

He also admitted assaulting a constable by spitting at him on the same date and acting in a threatening manner towards officers at the police station.

Defence lawyer Gary Foulis argued that his client had not set out to get his hands on a stun gun which was disguised as a mobile phone.

Defence lawyers for Thompson, pictured, had argued his case was 'out of the ordinary'

He said that the device was not a barrelled weapon that fired bullets which could cause serious damage.

The Firearms Act 2003 offence carries a minimum five year jail sentence unless the court decides there are exceptional circumstances.

But Mr Foulis said a five year sentence would be 'disproportionate' given the circumstances of the case.

He said: 'This is a scenario that is certainly out of the ordinary.'

However, fiscal depute David Bernard argued there were no exceptional circumstances to the case and said Thompson could have handed the stun gun in.

Sheriff Christopher Shead sentenced Thompson to five years in prison.

Chief Inspector George MacDonald, from Grampian Police, said: 'Thankfully incidents of this type are rare within the city and I believe the sentence sends out a strong message to any individuals who concern themselves with weapons of any description.

'Through excellent joint working we have seen significant reductions in violence in Aberdeen city centre and across the city as a whole.

'However, we will continue to target the small number who choose to involve themselves  in violence, drugs, and anti-social behaviour and, as the public expect of us, lock the perpetrators up.'

Police forces across the UK have seen a growing number of stun guns disguised as mobile phones on Britain's streets in recent years.

Marketed in the U.S. as self-defence weapons, they can be bought online and delivered to the UK for as little as £9.

Police fear as many as 10,000 could be out on the streets.

One website MailOnline visited said: 'A cell phone stun gun will cause your attacker pain and leave them temporarily immobilized and disoriented, but cause them no permanent damage.'

But such stun guns are classed as firearms under UK law and possession carries a minimum jail sentence of five years and maximum of up to ten years.

There is also concern that potentially lethal weapons, some 20 times more powerful than the Taser guns used by police, can easily be brought into the UK.

A Mail investigation in January uncovered a German website selling 1million volt stun guns which could be mail delivered into Britain with a free can of pepper spray.

They are highly prized by members of the criminal underworld as an alternative to guns and knives.

In the last three years the Met police force has seized 498 stun guns in London alone.
