Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK would send around 75 military trainers to train Syrian rebels

Britain is to provide military training to Syrian rebel groups fighting ISIS, the Government has announced on the final day of Parliament.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK would send around 75 military trainers and headquarters staff to provide instruction in the use of weapons, infantry tactics and medical skills.

The training, which forms part of a US-led programme to support the moderate Syrian opposition, will take place in Turkey.

Mr Fallon said ISIS could only be defeated by local forces on the ground in Syria and Iraq.

He said: 'Britain remains at the forefront of coalition military efforts to support the Iraqi government in their fight against Isil.

'This effective and closely co-ordinated activity in conjunction with Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces has largely stalled the terrorists' advances.

'But Isil must be defeated in both Iraq and Syria. In Syria, coalition air strikes have supported the liberation of Kobane and have disrupted Isil's logistics and supply lines.

'However, defeating Isil ultimately lies with local forces and we are helping to create effective ground forces in Syria, as well as in Iraq, so they can take the fight to Isil.'

The training programme, expected to start in the coming weeks, is intended to equip and train thousands of screened members of the opposition in Syria over the next three years.

British military instructors have already been providing training to Kurdish peshmerga militias fighting ISIS in northern Iraq.

Mr Fallon said two RAF Sentinel surveillance aircraft were also being deployed to the region to operate alongside Tornado strike jets and Reaper drones that have been carrying out air strikes against ISIS targets in Iraq.

These will provide wide area surveillance over Iraq of IS activity and track improvised explosive device (IED) laying activity.

The RAF planes will join the Tornados and Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft which have conducted 194 strikes over Iraq, starting on 23 March.

The UK continues to be the second largest contributor to the coalition airstrike campaign and is playing a leading role in the coalition's counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) training programme, the Ministry of Defence said.

This is in addition to the infantry and Heavy Machine Gun skills training packages the MoD has already delivered to over 1,100 members of the Iraqi Forces.

Mr Fallon added: 'Britain remains at the forefront of coalition military efforts to support the Iraqi government in their fight against Isil.'

The number of asylum-seekers in the Western countries rose by nearly 50 per cent last year - driven by the devastating conflicts in Syria and Iraq, the UN has revealed.

In 2014, some 866,000 people applied for asylum across Europe, North American and other wealthy countries - up 45 percent in just a year earlier.

The surge is linked to the spiralling conflicts in the Middle East, which have created 'the worst humanitarian crisis of our era,'  the UN's Melissa Fleming told reporters.

As a sign of the crisis, the number of asylum applications last year was the second highest on record, coming very close to the all-time-high of the about 900,000 requests made in 1992, at the beginning of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNHCR said.

Syria's conflict, now in its fifth year, has killed more than 215,000 people and forced 11.4 million people to flee their homes, including nearly four million who have left the country.

Last year, 150,000 Syrians applied for asylum in industrialised countries, marking a 166-percent hike from 2013 and accounting for a fifth of all asylum claims, the UNHCR report said.

As the violence in Syria has spilled over into neighbouring Iraq with the ruthless Islamic State jihadist group, Iraqis too have been leaving in droves.

Last year they accounted for 68,700 asylum applications to wealthy nations - almost double the number a year earlier - while Afghans made up the third largest group, with almost 60,000 applications.
