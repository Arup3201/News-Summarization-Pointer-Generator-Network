Nick Clegg was accused of hypocrisy last night after it was alleged that a Liberal Democrat fundraiser had sought to bypass donation laws.

Ibrahim Taguri told an undercover reporter posing as a wealthy Indian businessman that he would be able to channel money via family members and backdate cheques to avoid appearing on public registers.

He was also said to have promised big donations could ‘open doors’ and introduced the fake donor to key figures including Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander.

Mr Alexander was recorded at a dinner thanking the supposed businessman for what he was doing, adding: ‘I won’t intrude on the details, but genuinely it will make a difference.’

All donations of £7,500 or more are supposed to be publically registered.

Last night Sir Alastair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said Mr Clegg’s high-minded rhetoric on sleaze was not matched by his party’s actions.

‘The leader of the party has always taken a stand on high standards in politics,’ he said. ‘There’s a conflict between what he says, and what his party is doing.

‘Any attempt to breach legal rules around party donations is a very serious matter. It is most unfortunate that the Lib Dems seem to be encouraging people to get round the legal provisions of party funding rules. You’d expect higher standards and better leadership.’

Last night it emerged that the Lib Dems had agreed to hand back Mr Taguri’s Commons pass after accepting he should not have had one as it raised the prospect of him using the Parliamentary estate for fundraising purposes.

Sir Alastair said: ‘It is against the rules to carry out party political campaigning in the Commons, so allowing him to have a pass could be in breach of the rules. You’d class fundraising as party political campaigning.’

Lord Ashdown, the party’s election campaign leader, admitted that Mr Taguri – who yesterday quit as the Lib Dems’ general election candidate in Brent Central and is now likely to stand as an independent – had ‘serious questions to answer’.

Mr Clegg told LBC Radio that Mr Alexander had done nothing wrong, save being polite to someone to whom he was introduced.

The Deputy Prime Minister said the recording showed ‘Danny being a polite guy, just saying thank you to someone who he has been told is supporting the party’.

‘The idea that Danny or any parliamentarian has done anything wrong is categorically untrue,’ he said.

‘On the issue of Ibrahim Taguri, no cheque has been received by the Liberal Democrats, no cheque has been cashed. If we had received this cheque in question, of course it would have been scrutinised and checked.’

Mr Taguri, who has also stepped down as the Lib Dem race equality champion, denied any wrongdoing and said he was ‘confident that I will be exonerated of all the claims made against me’.

He intends to fight the election as an independent but said he hoped to return to the party fold after clearing his name.

The undercover reporter was apparently able to secure meetings with senior figures including Mr Alexander after giving several thousand pounds and promising far more.

He was introduced to figures such as Lord Ashdown, taken to Mr Clegg’s office and attended a dinner for major party benefactors where he met Mr Alexander, the newspaper said.

The fake donor is alleged to have been told by Mr Taguri that he could channel a donation via a ‘cousin’ after explaining that he wanted to remain ‘discreet’ about his financial support.

He went on to hand over a cheque for more than the £7,500 threshold beyond which donations must be publicly registered with the Electoral Commission.

Commission guidance, issued in 2007 in the wake of a scandal of ‘proxy’ donations to Labour, says giving money via a third party ‘must not be used as an attempt to evade the controls on permissibility and transparency’.

Backdating a cheque could have allowed the donor to split the gift into smaller amounts of less than £7,500 – thus allowing him to evade declaring his name.

A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said: ‘We are aware of what’s been reported and are establishing the facts before determining what further steps to take.’
