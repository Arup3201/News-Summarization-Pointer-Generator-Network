John Moore has been awarded £400 after being put up in a Club 18-30 hotel by Thomas Cook 

A Parish councillor  has won a £400 payout from Thomas Cook after booking what he thought was a 'relaxing holiday' to a Greek party island where he was housed with 'boozed up' youngsters at a Club 18-30 hotel.

John Moore, 56, from Herne in Kent, planned to spend a week on the island of Zante with his partner Angela, 51, in September.

Rather than the peaceful break they were hoping for, the couple, who run a sweet shop in Herne Bay, Kent,  were booked into Christina Studios in the resort of Laganas in Zante, advertised as an 18-30 clubbing destination. 

After spending two nights in the hotel where youngsters were 'banging on the walls and screaming and shouting', the couple abandoned the package holiday for something more quiet. 

They have since been awarded £400 in compensation by the holiday company. 

While being advertised by Club 18-30, Christina Studios is described on the Thomas Cook website as 'one of the best chill-out zones' in Zante. 

Upon their arrival however Mr Moore found 'boozed up' youngsters who 'didn't seem to sleep'. 

'When we got there I asked the rep if he really thought I would book an 18-30 holiday,' the Parish councillor said.  

'When I go on holiday I don't care really where it is, I want to just have a good time but it wasn't made obvious to me that it was a holiday for young people.

'It was an official 18-30 resort. It was packed with youngsters banging on the walls and screaming and shouting, so we decided to find somewhere else more to our liking.' 

After complaining to the Thomas Cook rep at the resort, the couple were told in order to be relocated they would have to pay extra on top of the £600 they had already spent. 

They would also have no other choice but to go to another Club 18-30, said Mr Moore.  

'We were just speechless really, it wasn't what we wanted or what we were expecting and Angela was horrified.' 

While the couple were dismayed at having to share their accommodation with 'rowdy' youngsters, they were least impressed with the owner of the hotel's treatment towards them. 

'The apartments didn't have hot water but when I complained the owner used very, very rude language.' 

At that Mr Moore and his partner packed their things immediately and, they say, waited outside the hotel for their rep to find them new accommodation. 

Eventually they decided to find themselves somewhere else to stay and filed a complaint with the company upon their return to the UK. 

Mr Moore decided to launch legal action when they failed to act, and was recently offered £400 after requesting a summons from a judge.  

The hotel where Mr Moore and his partner stayed was advertised as being 600m from the Laganas strip (above), hailed as one of Zante's biggest nightlife spots 

The 56-year-old Parish councillor said Christina Studios (above) where he was placed was 'packed with youngsters' who 'screamed and banged on walls' 

'I'm not surprised at all (that they've offered me money), they didn't have a leg to stand on,' he said, speaking of the offer. 

'They sent us to an 18-30s hotel having seen how old we looked.' 

Among reviews of the apartments online is one which warns: 'Don't bother if you are over thirty as it's too noisy.'  

The apartments are a five minute walk from the Laganas strip, described by Thomas Cook as Zante's 'party resort' whose nightlife is 'in the same league as Ibiza'. 

But Mr Moore claims he was sold a relaxing holiday, with the resort also described as suitable for family trips. 

Among TripAdvisor reviews of the hotel are some which describe it as 'filthy' and 'noisy'. 

One positive comment was left by a young woman who described it as the 'ultimate' place for a boys or girls' holiday. 

Thomas Cook apologised for the couple's experience in September.  

'We would like to apologise to Mr Moore for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the Christina Studios in Zante with our Escapades brand in September 2014,' a spokesman said. 

'It is never our intention to disappoint our customers and we are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to his satisfaction.' 

The accommodation is advertised as being provided by Club 18-30 on the Thomas Cook website (above)
