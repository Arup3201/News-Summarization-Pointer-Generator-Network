He was running excitedly for his life with 1,200lb of raging bull on his tail. And then he tripped.

In that split second yesterday, this young thrill-seeker’s carnival adventure turned into a horror show that put him inches from death.

Before screaming crowds and live on TV, he was trampled, tossed and crushed, gored in the groin and impaled at one stage on the bull’s horn.

Trapped: The man is caught between the horns of an El Pilar fighting bull after being gored

He spent 40 seconds at the mercy of the massive black beast before helpers managed to drag him to safety.

Incredibly, he survived. But 
yesterday  the incident reignited controversy over this year’s Running 
of the Bulls festival in Pamplona, Spain, on what became its bloodiest 
day.

Three people were gored and at least six badly injured in the run, celebrated annually by participants from 
all over the world and universally condemned  by campaigners against 
animal cruelty.

Dramatic footage of the 31-year-old 
Spaniard’s terrifying brush  with death showed him losing his footing as
he and others ran ahead of a single bull.

Desperate: The man tries to escape the bull as a steward gets out a stick to distract the angry animal

Attack: The half-ton beast gored the 31-year-old twice in the groin and once in the leg

Frantic: A runner pulls on the tail of the bull in an attempt to distract it and make it drop the mauled man

Terror: Other runners tried to distract the animal by grabbing its tail and waving newspapers at it. But a friend was only able to drag him away after more than half a minute of terror

Emergency: The injured man, from the eastern Spanish province of Castellon between Barcelona and Alicante, was undergoing an emergency operation this morning. His condition was described as 'serious'

It was charging through the narrow, crowded street after it broke away from the stampede.

Instead of simply jumping over him, 
however, the bull stops and appears to seek out the runner, who is 
wearing a distinctive blue and yellow shirt.

He tries to scramble to safety at the
side of the street but the bull picks him up with one horn and flings 
him back into the centre of the road.

It stamps on him and gores  him repeatedly before tossing him in the air.

One horn penetrates so deeply into 
the runner’s thigh that the point can be seen jutting up through his 
skin on the other side. All he can do is grasp the horn and hang on.

Marshals and fellow runners try 
frantically to free him, pulling the bull by the tail, before he is 
eventually dragged to safety.

Treatment: Red Cross personnel look after a runner or 'mozo' after being gored by a bull from Pilar ranch, during the sixth bullrun of Sanfermines

Emergency: Red Cross personnel carry a runner on a stretcher to receive treatment after being gored

Yesterday he was said to be ‘serious’
in hospital and undergoing emergency surgery. The bull went on to 
charge several more runners and spectators before rejoining the rest of 
the herd.

The gorings were the first of this 
year’s festival, which saw 15 runners taken to hospital with other 
injuries during the previous five days.

Since records began in 1911, 15 
people have been killed at the event, made famous by Ernest Hemingway’s 
1926 novel The Sun Also Rises.

Between 200 and 300 people are 
usually injured each year. The encierros, as the runs are called, have 
become increasingly popular with foreigners, who join locals drinking 
and partying all night before thousands compete in the 8am event.

The idea is to race ahead of and alongside the bulls, released together at the start of the 850-metre course.

But it is a race the animals  can never win. Hours after each run, they are destined to die in  a bullfight.

Tradition: Revelers from around the world arrive to Pamplona every year to take part on some of the eight days of the running of the bulls

Annual event: Fifteen people have been killed at the annual festival, made famous by a 1926 Ernest Hemingway novel, since records began in 1911

Run: The event has become increasingly popular with foreigners, who join the locals by staying up all night drinking and partying before thousands compete in the 8am run

Draw: Pamplona's population of 200,000 swells to around two million during the festival, the largest in Spain

Aggression: An 'El Pilar' fighting bull charges against a reveler

Count: Hospital authorities initially said four people were gored but the regional government revised that down to three

Fail: The woman does not succeed as she runs ahead while the bull makes contact

Sport: A young woman tries to outrun a bull at the close of the running-with-the-bulls in the old city of Pamplona

Duration: Today's event lasted just under five minutes, roughly double the normal length. Longer runs normally occur when some of the bulls get separated from the pack and become disoriented and more dangerous

The black bull which caused most panic Friday made several more attempts to charge people before he was eventually guided along the narrow streets to join the rest for the pack in the pen of the packed bull ring

Legend: Ernest Hemingway popularized the week-long fiesta in his book The Sun Also Rises in 1926

Deaths: The fighting bulls used in the centuries-old fiesta can weigh up to at 1,380 pounds (625 kilograms) and have killed 15 people since record-keeping began in 1924
