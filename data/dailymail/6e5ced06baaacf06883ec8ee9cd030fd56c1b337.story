She may have found fame on The Only Way Is Essex but Lauren Pope, 32, is proving to be a serious force to be reckoned with in the fashion industry.

The TOWIE star recently launched an accessories range, landed herself a modelling contract and was even voted more fashionable that the Duchess of Cambridge.

Now, the DJ and entrepreneur has unveiled the latest drop from her popular fashion range with In The Style - and poses in a slick, high fashion shoot to showcase her designs.

The TOWIE star, who found herself in some drama when she locked lips with Jake Hall, has unveiled her spring/summer range for In The Style

Lauren, who was involved in some drama after she shared a drunken kiss with newcome Jake Hall, is sure to catch his attention in the new shots. 

Speaking about her spring/summer15 range, the reality TV star-turned-designer told FEMAIL: 'I've given this range some added elements of boho and tailoring - I like to mix up my styles and don't tend to stick to one look, so I wanted that to show in the range.'

Lauren says her latest drop for the e-tailer is full of boho elements and the kind of tailoring she loves

The model and DJ cites Nicole Richie, Diane Kruger and Jamie Chung as her style and beauty icons

Inspired by bloggers and street style photography, Lauren has combined the latest catwalk trends with her own taste in clothes to curate a trend-led collection. 

The range reflects Lauren's personal sense of style, which she says can vary hugely.

'One of my favourite current trends is this whole 70s vibe; my hair and makeup tend to be a little relaxed and that fits well with this look. I also love my tailoring and feel great in a well fitted suit,' she said of her signature look.

Lauren, who cites Nicole Richie, Diane Kruger and Jamie Chung, as her style and beauty icons, said she would love to see Diane donning her designs.

'She always dresses amazingly and I think everyone is aware of my Nicole Richie obsession by now so she's always top of my list!,' she said. 

In five years time, Lauren hopes to be settled with a family and continuing to work on building her business empire in fashion, beauty and music

With a successful brand to her name and the respect of the fashion world, it seems the future is bright for Lauren.

Over the next few years she plans on channeling 'empowered, positive women who are the boss of their own business empire and running things on their own terms' like Natalie Massenet, Michelle Mone and Elle Macpherson.

'In five years time, hopefully I'll be settled with a family of my own and continuing to work on building my business empire in fashion, beauty and music,' she said.  

'I work incredibly hard on all the behind the scenes goings on of everything I'm involved in and I'm always learning and taking on new challenges. I love every single minute of it and that will continue long past the next five years.'
