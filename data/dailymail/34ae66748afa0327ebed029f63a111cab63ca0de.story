A Japanese passenger plead guilty Friday to assaulting a flight attendant while in a drunken stupor on a flight from Osaka, Japan, to Honolulu, Hawaii.  

The passenger, Kenji Okamoto, 30, plead guilty in federal court to interfering with the duties of a flight attendant by assaulting and intimidating him.

According to a criminal complaint, Okamoto, who is from Kyoto, was flying first-class on a Delta Air Lines flight from 
Osaka for his honeymoon last month when flight attendants noticed he was
 drunk before takeoff.

Drunken passenger Kenji Okamoto, 30, was arrested after assaulting a flight attendant during a transpacific flight. Okamoto had been drinking in celebration of recent marriage and upcoming honeymoon

Okamoto told authorities later that before 
boarding the plane, he had four glasses of beer and one glass of wine. He continued drinking champagne and wine upon boarding the plane.

On the flight, Okamoto got upset when one of the flight attendants wouldn't take his 
meal tray away. This caused Okamoto to allegedly throw 'a roundhouse type punch' 
at another flight attendant who intervened in an attempt to diffuse the 
situation.

Okamoto struck the flight attendant in his arms, which were raised to protect his head, according to the complaint.

After being restrained by crew members, Okamoto apologized while crying, remained calm for the remainder of the flight 
and eventually fell asleep. 'Okamoto apologized for 
his actions by repeatedly saying 'I'm sorry' and bowed down on his knees
 and placed his head on the floor,' the complaint said.

During an interview with authorities, Okamoto said he's in the 
construction business and was 'drinking heavily because he was 
celebrating his honeymoon with his wife ... that he married on April 20,
 2014.'

The Federal Detention Center, in Honolulu, Hawaii. Okamoto was denied bond after being arrested due to lying about previous criminal convictions he had gotten in Japan

The incident happened "like a flash," said Okamoto. He claimed not to remember what exactly happened but that he
 was upset because he felt like he was being disrespected when the first
 flight attendant wouldn't take his tray away.

U.S. Magistrate Kevin Chang initially allowed Okamoto to 
be released on $50,000 bond, but Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Hino 
appealed, arguing that Okamoto didn't disclose a previous conviction in 
Japan for assaulting a police officer.

Hino's appeal provided photos of 
the Okamoto's near full-body tattoos, arguing that Okamoto is a flight 
risk and a danger.

Delta banned Okamoto from flying on the airline, according to Hino's appeal.

U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright granted the appeal to keep him 
held without bail at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center.

Because he was arrested at the airport, he never got to enjoy his 
honeymoon, which was to be spent at a luxury resort in east Honolulu, 
Hino said.

He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison when he's sentenced on Sept. 22.
