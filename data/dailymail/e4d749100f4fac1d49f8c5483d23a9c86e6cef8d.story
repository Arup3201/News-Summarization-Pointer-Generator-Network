CONCERNED: The Princess Royal has spoken out

The Princess Royal is demanding a crackdown on the transport of live horses from Britain to European slaughterhouses – fearing the illegal trade is causing unnecessary suffering to hundreds of animals every week.

Unscrupulous dealers are getting around the ban on exporting live horses for slaughter by claiming the animals are being sent to the Continent as pets or for work or riding, when in fact they are destined for dinner plates.

Some horses change hands several times and often endure horrific four-day journeys in trucks before slaughter in an Italian or French abattoir.

Princess Anne, president of World Horse Welfare, called for greater checks at ports and a national database to protect vulnerable horses.

She said: ‘There should be a clear understanding that horses don’t travel live to slaughter from the UK overseas and that is something we should be able to maintain and stand by.’

The charity has found dealers flouting the rules because there are no routine checks on lorries transporting horses from British ports.

Princess Anne suggested that many owners who have sold a beloved horse believing it would become a cherished pet could find that the animal had instead been sold for its meat.

‘I suspect there are a lot of innocent victims who think they are selling their horses appropriately... but they are going to market where slaughter buyers do attend,’ she said.

Thousands of horses are sold as meat throughout Europe. The trade came under scrutiny last year when horsemeat was found in burgers and lasagnes sold as beef in British stores.

If horses are to be sold for meat, World Horse Welfare argues that they should be slaughtered in British abattoir to prevent them suffering lengthy journeys.

Princess Anne, a former British eventing champion, said: ‘I really hope eventually that technology will make a difference. If we had a better form of identification it would give confidence to owners and dealers alike that they know where their horses were going.’ Thousands of unwanted horses a year are sold at UK markets such as Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire and Llanybydder, Carmarthenshire. Dealers can pick up a pony for as little as £5 but sell its meat on the continent for up to £250. A larger horse may sell for less than £75 but the meat can make £600.

WELFARE: Campaigners are worried about horses enduring long lorry trips; some trips last four days 

In two days last year, World Horse Welfare found 900 horses being transported through Dover alone. It is not known how many ended up slaughtered. Charity chief executive Roly Owers said: ‘We are delighted the Princess supports our campaign for more checks at British ports to prevent horses suffering long journeys and maybe not getting a humane end to their lives.’

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘We have a rigorous system of inspections and checks to make sure that horses are healthy and fit for transport. Any evidence of illegal practice in relation to the welfare of horses is investigated with a view to prosecution.’
