Manchester United fear that Paddy McNair has joined their list of defensive casualties with the teenager understood to have suffered a hamstring injury in Sunday's win over Everton.

McNair, 19, has started the last two games in central defence because of injuries to Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling.

But after he was called up by Northern Ireland on Monday in place of Evans for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against the Faroe Islands and Greece, it emerged that McNair was unable to join up with Michael O'Neill's squad because he could be out for up to three weeks.

Prior to the news of McNair's injury Irish boss Michael O’Neill said last week that he would resist the temptation to call up the teenager, who has represented his country at Under-17, Under-19 and Under-21 levels.

‘I want to make sure that when we bring Paddy in it’s right for Paddy as much as it’s right for us,’ said O’Neill. ‘He has played one game for United which is fantastic, but it’s a big jump and we have enough quality in defence at the moment.’

McNair impressed again in United’s 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday when he came up against £28million striker Romelu Lukaku.

United boss Louis van Gaal had already warned his senior defenders that they face a battle to dislodge McNair when they are fit again.

‘I have to select them, do you understand?’ said Van Gaal. ‘Paddy McNair is doing great in my opinion. Players coming back, I have to select them but I have better choice than no choice.’
