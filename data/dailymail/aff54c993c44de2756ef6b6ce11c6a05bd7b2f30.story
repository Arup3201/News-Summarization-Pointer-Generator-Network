A secondary school teacher who was imprisoned for biting off his wife’s nose is engaged again - while he serves a five-year prison sentence.

Nicholas Gough, 59, was jailed in March after admitting the violent assault on his wife of 24 years Lynne which left her disfigured for life.

But Gough, of Wolverhampton, is now planning to tie the knot with divorced grandmother Anne Carr, 54, of Redditch, Worcestershire, when he is released from Featherstone Prison.

New found love: Anne Carr, pictured with her engagement ring, is to marry convict Nicholas Gough, right, who she believes that her soon-to-be husband has had a 'hard time'

The brute, who taught at Phoenix Collegiate Academy in Wednesbury, West Midlands, for ten years, threatened to kill Lynne, and tried to strangle her following the frenzied attack in a gazebo in their back garden after downing a bottle of wine.

The 'possessive' science teacher swore at Lynne, 52, and held her down on the floor, before sinking his teeth into the tip of her nose.

After the attack at their home in September 2011 Gough tried to persuade his wife to tell people her injuries were inflicted by their pet dog.

Retired local government worker Anne met Gough in February last year through a friend.

The smitten pair got engaged on May 11 
during one of Anne’s regular visits to Featherstone Prison - when the 
father slipped a diamond ring on to her finger.

Victim: Lynne suffered hideous injuries after her husband sunk his teeth into her nose

Speaking about her fiancee, Anne, from Redditch, Worcestershire, said: 'I believe he’s a good man and I’m going to stand by him.

'There are two sides to this story, and I feel Nick’s in prison for something he didn’t commit.

'He pleaded guilty to prevent any more suffering, and he was told if he didn’t plead guilty he would have faced a much longer sentence.'

The couple’s first date was in March 2011 - two months after Lynne moved in with another man, claiming her husband had been violent towards her.

Anne agreed to step aside when Lynne, whose new partner died suddenly, had a reconciliation with her husband and moved back into the marital home in the summer last year.

But arguments escalated between the married pair, culminating in the violent attack last September.

When he was jailed for five years, Judge Martin Walsh said the attack had left his wife 'disfigured’ for life.'

The couple had been married for 24 years and had three children together - as well as three others between them from previous relationships.

Mrs Carr, who plans to tie the knot with Gough when he is released, says the duo hit it off straight away.

She added: 'I liked him because he was a family man, he was fun and he had had a tough time.

'He was very open, and he would come and stay at my house.

'Him going to jail has put us under an enormous amount of pressure but I love him.

'I believe he’s a good man and I’m going to stand by him.

'When I went to see him, I put the ring on my finger that I had bought, as he has no access to funds, and took it off for him and he pushed it on my finger.

'We are going to make a home together and hopefully get married around six months after he’s out.'

Gough’s ex wife Lynne, from Wolverhampton, said: 'I’ll have the scars of what he did forever.'
