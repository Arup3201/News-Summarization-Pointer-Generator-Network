The Queen's closest aides are to be publicly grilled by MPs to justify her spending, the Mail can reveal.

Members of Prince Charles’s inner circle will also give evidence to Parliament about whether they are wasting taxpayers’ money.

The amount of public funds going to the Royal Family soared last year, despite Government cuts.

Now the most powerful watchdog in Westminster, the Public Accounts Committee, will scrutinise royal finances to ensure the country is getting value for money.

Value for money: The finances of Queen Elizabeth II, pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh during her Diamond Jubilee Pageant, will be scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee

Committee sources say the MPs, chaired by former Labour minister Margaret Hodge, will hold hearings into the money paid to Prince Charles, before moving on to the Crown Estates, the £7billion property empire from which the Queen derives her income.

In April, Buckingham Palace will receive a payment of £36.1million of public money to fund the Queen’s official duties, a 16 per cent increase on the £31million paid by taxpayers to finance the Monarchy last year.

Public funding to support Prince Charles rose by 11 per cent last year, taking the contribution from the taxpayer to almost £2.2million. His spending rose by 3.6 per cent to more than £20.2million.

The unprecedented Parliamentary probe will mean that Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse – effectively the Queen’s treasurer – will face being questioned in front of the television cameras.

Sir Christopher Geidt and William Nye, the private secretaries to the Queen and Prince Charles who usually operate behind the scenes, could also be called to give evidence.

‘The plan is to do the Prince of Wales first and then look at the Queen,’ a source told the Mail. ‘We need to be sure when other public services are being cut that there is value for money.’

The committee will focus on the Queen’s use of public money to perform her official duties, including official receptions, investitures, garden parties and maintenance of the royal palaces. She pays for the running of her household from private income. But it will also look at Prince Charles and Prince William’s travel arrangements. The £2.2million extra Clarence House received last year was primarily spent on overseas tours. But critics claim some of the money goes on private visits.

The inquiry has come about because of a change this year in the way the Royal Family is funded.Chancellor George Osborne has scrapped the Civil List – an annual handout to the Royal Family that had to be approved by Parliament since 1760 – in favour of paying the Monarch 15 per cent of the income from the Crown Estates assets, which include Regent Street and Ascot racecourse.

But a second part of the deal – enacted into law in 2011 – means the royal finances are now subject to scrutiny by the National Audit Office. And now the Public Accounts Committee is set to take up its option of holding public hearings into the Royal Family’s funding. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said he backed the move to give Parliament scrutiny of the Queen’s expenses as long as it was ‘proportionate’.

He added: ‘It would be unreasonable to examine the Queen’s private sources of income and expenditure.

Labour MP Austin Mitchell, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘It is about ensuring that the public are getting good value for money. At the moment there is no accountability for spending what is a considerable fortune.’
