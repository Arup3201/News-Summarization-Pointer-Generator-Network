Killed: Eileen Brown, 60, died after a vein in her hip was severed by surgical screws in a botched operation

A grandmother bled to death after a surgeon cut into a vein during a botched hip replacement operation.

Eileen Brown, 60, was having a second hip replacement at Basildon Hospital in Essex, but after surgical screws drilled into her bones severed a vein and left her bleeding internally.

Surgeons were left defending the decision to use screws in the operation at all - rather than surgical cement, which could have eliminated the risk, an inquest heard.

Mrs Brown was especially vulnerable, the inquest was told, as she suffered from brittle bones and osteoporosis. At five feet tall and weighing around nine stone, she also had a slight frame.

Mrs Brown's brother and two sons are now considering legal action after a coroner in Chelmsford ruled that the operation killed her.

Doctors could have decided to use quick-drying cement to replace her hip, which was itself a replacement from a 2010 operation which had fractured.

But orthopaedic locum consultant Dr Amgad Nakhla opted to widen the socket of her hip and drill through the bones, which left it at risk of breaking.

The court heard this fractured her hip in several places. Some of the screws – up to 35mm long - to hold the hip in place ended up passing through both sides of bone before a vein was ruptured.

Medics tried to repair the tear, but she lost ‘a significant amount’ of blood and later died.

Pathologist Dr Martin Goddard said she was given around six litres of blood in a bid to keep her alive.

He gave the cause of death as a haemorrhage caused by the ruptured vein. Existing heart disease may also have impacted her chances of survival.

Dr Graham Keene, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, told the inquest that the proportion of operations which use screws as opposed to cement is around 50-50.

But, he added, for a patient with softer bones or osteoporosis it is more difficult to use the uncemented procedure and there was a greater risk of fractures.

He said: ‘It appears the first inserted socket was loose and did not fit well when screwed in place. It was removed and the socket was drilled up and a larger one put in and in that process a fracture was noticed.’

He said the use of a 55cm socket for someone so small concerned him and may have left ‘the external shell of her pelvis very thin.’

Operation: Mrs Brown was undergoing the surgery at Basildon University Hospital

Dr Keene described how a metal plate was secured to the back of Mrs Brown's pelvis with four screws. Drilling these in was likely to have caused one of her veins to rupture, he said.

By the end bleeding was noticed, partly caused by the fractured hip, but largely from a punctured vein, he said, which was likely to have been caused by the drilling or a screw protruding through the bone.

Surgeons are supposed to ensure that screws only go into a ‘safe zone’ area and avoid them piercing the other side of the bone, Dr Keene said.

He added: ‘If the screw is out of the front of the pelvis towards the vein it was more likely to have been outside the safe zone.’

Medics realised she was swelling from internal bleeding while sowing her up after the operation and specialist vascular surgeons were brought in to stem the blood loss - but she died days later.

Dr Nakhla, who carried out the bulk of the surgery on May 2 last year, initially stood by his decision saying at the hospital patients under 70 would usually have the uncemented procedure.

However, he later added: ‘I perfectly accept if it was cemented it could have prevented the fracture and vein injury and that the cementless option has higher incidents of fracture.’

Anger: Roger and Steve Brown, Mrs Brown's sons, say they are considering legal action in light of the coroner's decision

He added: ‘The risk of this happening was very low, but unfortunately to everyone here it did happen.’

The 
hospital carried out an internal investigation following the death and 
have brought in procedures to try to prevent a repeat.

Dr
 Amgad Nakhla said: ‘I am currently working on a system to drill into 
bones and avoid vascular injury. There have been some changes in 
practice.

'Hospital
 guidelines not do not allow cementless operations in any patient over 
70. That would not have changed it for Mrs Brown, but it should minimise
 it.’

Coroner Eleanor McGann told Mrs Brown's family: ‘I hope you feel we have had a full and frank inquiry. The conclusion I reach is she died as a result of a complication of a medical procedure which was necessary to relive her pain.’

Mrs Brown’s grieving relatives said her death could easily have been avoided.

Brother Peter Humphrey from Laindon, Essex, and her sons Roger and Steve Brown, from Avelye, also in Essex, attended the inquest.

Outside court Mr Humphrey said: ‘This should never have happened. For someone with her history of brittle bones they should have cemented the hip. There are a lot of unanswered questions from the inquest and we will be looking to take legal action.’
