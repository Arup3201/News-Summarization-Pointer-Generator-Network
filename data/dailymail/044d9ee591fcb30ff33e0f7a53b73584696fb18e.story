They were regarded as hell-raising, X-rated anarchists.

Having lambasted the Queen, sworn live on TV, and been banned from almost everywhere, the feared and hated Sex Pistols redefined controversy in the 1970s.

But on Christmas Day in 1977, they shocked everyone for one last time - by holding a kids' Christmas party.

Shocking: Johnny Rotten, seen as a foul-mouthed punk, dished out Christmas cake for children

Last hurrah: The Londoner is seen here singing as the young audience dances around him. The group omitted swear words from their hits for their last ever gig, and later danced to pop hits by Boney M

The free gig was in Ivanhoe's in Huddersfield city centre on Christmas Day in 1977

Handing out cake, badges, pencil cases, and posters, Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, Steve Jones, and Paul Cook hit the dancefloor with dozens of young children and teenagers for their final gig.

The free performance in Ivanhoe's nightclub in Huddersfield was a benefit gig for striking firefighters' children.

Having vowed to show solidarity with the strikers, the four London lads signed records and mingled with parents between songs - before diving into the remains of a giant Christmas cake the size of a car bonnet and starting a food fight.

The punk legends - who collectively 
called themselves 'the beast' - even joined their audience for a dance 
to pop classics like Boney M's Daddy Cool and Yes Sir, I Can Boogie by 
Baccara.

The children of striking firefighters were handed memorabilia from the band including pencil cases and badges

Season of giving: The group brought a giant Christmas cake the size of a car bonnet for the show

...Then they dived in it, starting a food fight to finish off the evening. It was Johnny Rotten's career highlight

As the night wore on, they continued dancing and singing, covered in cream and sponge

And when they cracked out their own hits like Bodies, they edited out the swear words.

Now, 36 years later, this unlikely moment will be screened in full for the first time as a Boxing Day special.

Parts of Never Mind The Baubles, which
 will be screened at 10pm on BBC4 this Thursday, have appeared on 
YouTube and in documentaries before.

The
 final extended edition, including interviews with the band members and 
their now grown up audience, shows the group's bizarre performance in 
its entirety.

Sid Vicious, who died weeks later, is seen in Never Mind The Baubles - a documentary about the unusual Christmas show - chatting with fans and giving them gifts

Children wearing neckerchiefs given to them by Sid and Johnny screamed out lyrics while they ate their cake

In the documentary, dozens of children are seen ecstatically bouncing around the dance floor

Director Julien Temple said: 'To most people they were monsters in the news. But seeing them playing with seven- and eight-year-olds is beautiful.'

'It's probably the best footage of the Pistols on film but it's never been seen,' director Julien Temple told The Guardian.

'To most people they were monsters in the news. But seeing them playing to seven- and eight-year-olds is beautiful. They were a radical band, but there was a lot more heart to that group than people know.'

Weeks after the performance, the group disbanded and Sid Vicious died.

To this day, Johnny Rotten says it was the highlight of his career, and of Sid's.
