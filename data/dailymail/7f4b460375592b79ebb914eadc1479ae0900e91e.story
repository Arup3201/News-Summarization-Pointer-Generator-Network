Appearance: Roy Harper, 72, leaves Hereford Magistrates' Court today with an unidentified woman

Veteran folk and rock performer Roy Harper has appeared in court charged with committing a series of child sex offences in the 1970s.

The singer-songwriter, who has performed with Pink Floyd and influenced rock band Led Zeppelin, was not required to enter a plea to any of the charges during a four-minute appearance at Hereford Magistrates' Court this morning.

Harper, 72, who lives in the Republic of Ireland, is accused of two counts of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged under 13.

The singer, of Rossmore, near Clonakilty, County Cork, also faces three charges of indecent assault and four of gross indecency relating to the same alleged victim.

West Mercia Police announced last week that Harper had been charged with the offences, which are alleged to have occurred between 1975 and 1977 in the Herefordshire area.

Harper, dressed in a checked shirt and blue jeans, spoke only to give the clerk of the court his name and full address during the hearing.

He declined to comment to reporters after his appearance before three magistrates, who granted unconditional bail and ordered him to appear before a judge at Worcester Crown Court on December 2.

The prolific performer has produced more than 30 albums during his career.

He has continued to perform since the claims emerged, playing sold out shows in London, Manchester and Bristol last month. Harper also released a new album in September.

The singer's influence on the world of folk rock was recognised by MOJO magazine in 2005 when they gave him a 'Hero Award'. He was worked with various leading bands during his 50-year career.

Harper sang lead vocals on Have a Cigar by Pink Floyd in 1975, and inspired a 1970 song by Led Zeppelin called Hats Off to (Roy) Harper.
