This hungry grasshopper was quick to climb up a tall leaf before munching into it - nearly cutting it completely in half.

The insect started to climb the untouched green leaf and its body could be seen in the form of a perfect shadow.

It then proceeded to tuck into the leaf for breakfast and managed to munch its way through - almost eating all of the way through it.

It then proceeded to tuck into the leaf for breakfast and managed to munch its way through - almost eating all of the way through it.

After gnawing through the leaf, it appeared to pose for the camera and celebrate as it devoured the morning meal.

Photographer Lessy Sebastian from Jakata, Indonesia, captured the special moment in his garden at 10am.

The 48-year-old said: 'I spotted the grasshopper in front of the house, it was on one of the water plants.

'I saw a grasshopper hidden behind the leaves, and the morning sun was pretty bright so it allowed me to see behind the leaf.

'It was perfect because the shadow on the leaf is clear - which was great as it enabled me to capture the special moment.

'I immediately grabbed my camera and snapped a number of photographs as he began to eat the leaf.'

The father-of-two had to wait patiently and made sure he didn't make any sudden movements to distract the grasshopper.

He added: 'My presence did make him a little distracted and he therefore stopped feeding sometimes.

'But I still waited patiently and couldn't believe it when the grasshopper started chewing - he ate a lot, until there was a huge gap in the leaf.'
