A larger-than-life sculpture of the the famous Times Square kiss at the end of World War II got a special visitor this week at its home in Sarasota, Florida.

The statue is based not on the famous picture taken by Alfred Eisenstaedt and published on the cover of Life, but an alternative picture of the couple snapped from a different angle by a Navy photographer and published in the New York Times. 

Carl 'Moose' Muscarello of Plantation, Florida, is one of several men who claims to be the sailor in the famous image

Revisited: Carl 'Moose' Muscarello is one of several men who claim to be the kissing sailor in the famous Life magazine picture. Above, he recreates the smooch with his wife below a larger-than-life sculpture of the famous image

Elation: Unconditional Surrender is a sculpture by artist Seward Johnson in Sarasota, Florida (left). It shows the famous subjects of a Life magazine cover kissing in Times Square on V-J Day 1945 (right)

Another perspective: Unconditional Surrender is actually based on a different image taken of the famous couple from another angle by a Navy photographer that was published in the New York Times

He was 18-years-old on August 14, 1945, and on leave from the Navy in New York, walking around Times Square with a buddy when victory over Japan was announced.

Mr Muscarello personally lost six friends he grew up with in Brooklyn, and was so grateful the conflict was over he kissed nearly anything in sight.

'I was very, very happy,' he told WTSP. 'I would kiss all of the girls who would stand still - I even kissed a couple of guys. I was just in a kissing mood, it was great.'

Time and place: Mr Muscarello was 18-years-old on August 14, 1945 when victory over Japan was announced. At the time, he was on leave from the Navy and in New York wandering around Times Square with a friend

Mr Muscarello's story sounds a lot like the soldier that Eisenstaedt captured for the famous Life magazine cover.

'In Times Suare on V-J Day I saw a sailor running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight. Whether she was a grandmother, stout, thin, old, didn't make a difference' the photographer recalled in his book Eisenstaedt on Eisenstaedt.

'I was running ahead of him with my Leica looking back over my shoulder but none of the pictures that were possible pleased me.

Serial kisser: Mr Muscarello recreated the kiss again with a local Florida reporter

In the moment: The reporter was taken by surprise when Mr Muscarello actually planted a kiss on her

'Then suddenly, in a flash, I saw something white being grabbed. I turned around and clicked the moment the sailor kissed the nurse.

'If she had been dressed in a dark dress I would never have taken the picture. If the sailor had worn a white uniform, the same. I took exactly four pictures. It was done within  a few seconds.'

Also present to see the sculpture this week was one of the picture's other subjects - a sailor in a white uniform in the background identified as Tom Bozza who traveled down to see the sculpture from Brandenton, Florida.

Reunited: Another one of the picture's subjects was in town to see the sculpture. Tom Bozzo (right) was the man in the white uniform in the background, and says he met Mr Muscarello on V-J Day but that they hadn't seen each other since

'I was there amongst thousands of veterans who were sharing the day. The war was over and this gentleman was kissing the nurse,' Mr Bozza said.

Mr Bozza and Mr Muscarello met on V-J Day but yesterday was the first time they had seen each other since that monumental meeting.

For Mr Muscarello, the sculpture doesn't convey a personal moment in his life, but a collective sigh of relief.

'That statue's not of me, but of what it represents,' he said. 'It represents the unconditional surrender. We were happy the war was over.'

The sculpture was originally erected in Sarasota in 2009, but was taken down after a car crash damaged the sculpture in April, 2012. The statue was again put up last December.
