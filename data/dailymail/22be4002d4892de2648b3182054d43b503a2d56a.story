Manchester United starlet Adnan Januzaj is prepared to play in any position to be given more opportunities under Louis van Gaal.

The 20-year-old made his breakthrough last season in one of the few highlights of David Moyes' ill-fated reign at Old Trafford, but has been used sparingly by Van Gaal this term as the Dutchman prefers to play a 3-5-2 system without orthodox wingers.

The young Belgian has started just eight games from 18 appearances this term but is prepared to play a variety of attacking roles.

'My game is all about trying to make things happen,' Januzaj told the club's official website.

'We had the diamond at Cambridge and I played as a left-midfielder. I feel comfortable there as well. I think I can play well there without a problem.

'My favourite position is as a winger or a no.10. There are a lot of players here and I can play in different roles – it is just a case of taking any opportunities.'

United, the former dominant force in the Premier League, have been criticised for not challenging for the title in Van Gaal's first season, although Januzaj insists a return to the Champions League was always a priority. 

'I think that's the aim – to try to qualify for next year's Champions League,' he added. 

'I played in it last year and it was very good to do so. I was really happy and you know you're waiting for that kind of opportunity again in the future.'
