Former Yahoo boss Terry Semel has sold his Malibu mansion on 'billionaires' beach' for $13million less than its asking price.

The estate on Carbon Beach, Malibu, in California with 151ft of beach frontage and nine bedrooms sold for $37million after it was listed in May for an asking price of $50million.

Semel's house is on the strip of beachfront mansions known as 'billionaires' beach' for its many wealthy homeowners, who have included Pierce Brosnan, Courtney Cox and John Travolta.

Price cut: Former Yahoo CEO Terry Semel has reportedly sold his Malibu mansion for $37 million, $13 million less than his asking price

Complete with nine bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, a huge outdoor swimming pool and 10,317 square feet of living space, it is clear from his asking price that Semel had high hopes when selling the property.

In describing the property, TMZ reported the listing agents Hilton & Hyland saying on their website: 'This building can be appreciated as a stand-alone piece of art.'

Semel resigned as CEO of Yahoo in June 2007 after six years in the top job before handing over to co-founder Jerry Yang.

During his tenure, he made more than $500million so perhaps knocking $13million off the asking price for the house was not a big deal.

The real estate sale comes as investment banker William Chadwick put his house, just half a mile down the coast from Semelâ€™s property, back on the market at $45million after attempting to sell it two years ago.
