Confectionery giant Cadbury has insisted it is not trying to trademark '50 shades' of purple after coming under fire from a Church of England bishop over rights to use the colour.

Fair trade 
company The Meaningful Chocolate Company claimed it had changed the 
colour of its box containing religious chocolate Christmas tree 
decorations after receiving legal advice that anything that could be 
interpreted as Cadbury purple should be avoided.

The company said the box had been 
Advent purple - the colour traditionally used in churches during the 
season of penitence and reflection in the run-up to Christmas - but was 
now a 'warm red'.

Dispute: Confectionery giant Cadbury has insisted it is not trying to trademark '50 shades' of purple after coming under fire from a Church of England bishop over rights to use the colour

'The legal advice was very clear - it
was not just purple, it was anything that could be interpreted as 
Cadbury’s purple, from deep blue to deep red,' David Marshall, from the 
firm, said.

Not happy: The Bishop of Chelmsford, Rt Reverend Stephen Cottrell, pictured, said Cadbury should reflect that before they even existed, the colour purple was around

Mr Marshall was backed by the Bishop of Chelmsford, Rt Reverend Stephen Cottrell.

He
said: 'Cadbury should reflect that before they even existed, the colour
purple was around and - perish the thought - after they have gone, it 
will still be here.

'You may own the rights to purple, but you can’t own the colour.

'Fighting some battles, even ones you win, can actually be demeaning.

'Far better to be generous, then no one loses.'

Cadbury said its victory in a 
dispute with rival Nestle over purple packaging did not amount to a bid 
to copyright all shades of purple - but merely to protect the Cadbury 
purple associated with its milk chocolate.

'We
are not seeking to trademark 50 shades of purple, it is about making 
sure that the consumer is not confused into thinking this is a Cadbury 
product - that is the nature of a trademark,' a spokesman for Cadbury 
said.

Cadbury also said the Rt Rev Cottrell had got his facts wrong.

'We
are not seeking to be precious about the colour purple, we are not 
seeking to copyright all shades of purple, we are merely seeking to 
protect the Cadbury purple that is associated with milk chocolate and 
not all other colours,' the spokesman said.
