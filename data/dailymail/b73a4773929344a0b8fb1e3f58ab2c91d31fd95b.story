Firefighters have rescued two reindeer after a 'huge' blaze broke out at a cafe being used as a Santa's grotto at a popular theme park.

Eight crews were sent to Creaky Cafe in Chessington World of Adventures, Surrey, which is situated next to several animal enclosures.Â 

They were alerted to the fire at 8.40am - just an hour and 20 minutes before thousands of families would have descended on the popular resort.

Response: Eight fire crews have been sent to the cafe, which is situated next to several animal enclosures

However, there are no reports of any injuries to either people or animals.

London Fire Brigade Station Manager Craig Carter, who was 
at the scene, said: 'The fire damaged a large part of a restaurant 
within the park, and crews worked very hard to bring it under control.

'There
 were a lot of flames and the area was quite smoky when we arrived, but 
thankfully no one was hurt. Two reindeer were evacuated and moved to a 
safe area, but park officials tell me they will still be ready for 
Christmas Eve next week.

'We're
 worked closely with our partners at Surrey Fire and Rescue Service 
along with the police and ambulance services to ensure the incident was 
brought safely under control.'

'Due to unforeseen circumstances, Chessington will be closed today,' it said. 'Tickets for today will be revalidated. Further updates will follow.'

A spokesman added: 'Well-practised
 emergency procedures were immediately put into operation and the 
emergency services were called and several fire engines were on site 
within minutes.

'The theme park and zoo were closed at the time of this incident and, therefore, no guests were involved.

'All staff areas were immediately evacuated and all staff and animals are safe and well.'

primary objective and Chessington World of Adventures' 
management team, in conjunction with the fire service, are investigating
 the cause of the incident.
