A mother whose 12-year-old girl is stranded on the crippled Carnival cruise ship has seen the girl for the first time in a week as she waved from the top deck of the stricken vessel.

The emotional reunion came as Rebekah Poret waved frantically at CNN helicopters hovering over the ship as her mother Mary watched a television screen and spoke with the girl over the phone.

'I love you,' Rebekah told her mother. 'I
 can't wait to see you. I can't wait to be back home.'

'I love you too. I
 promise I'm going to have a nice snuggly blanket for you when I see 
you,' Mary said, telling her daughter they could go to McDonalds. 
'Anything you want to eat tonight is yours.'

Mrs Poret is 
waiting in Mobile, Alabama, where the Carnival Triumph 
is expected to dock by 11 p.m. after five days 
stranded at sea. Her daughter said she cannot wait to be back on dry land.

'It feels a lot better because
 I know that we're one step closer to being back home,' Rebekah said, 
adding: 'But we're still so far away. I can't wait to get back.'

Rebekah spoke to CNN to reveal her daily hell dealing with 
'horrible smells', cold temperatures and not knowing when she's going to
 get her next meal.

She is on the ship with her father, Larry, her 10-year-old friend Allie Taylor and Allie's father Carmel.

'When
 I wake up in the morning, I ask my dad, "Can I go back to sleep again?"
 because I want another day to pass so bad,' Rebekah told CNN as she 
tried to stay warm.

She said one of the biggest struggles is getting food - and not knowing if there will be any warm food by the time they reach the front of the line. Allie said they have been eating cold sandwiches.

Rebekah added that a smell from the 
bathrooms is also insufferable, and lingers on every deck of the ship, 
which is carrying more than 5,000 people, including passengers and 
staff.

Distressed 
passengers have previously spoken of sewage sloshing around in hallways 
and dripping down the walls, flooded rooms and an unbearable stench.

'The bathroom situation is horrible,' Rebekah said. 'Some toilets are working and some of them are not working. On some parts of the ship it smells 
horrible but right here on deck five it doesn't smell too bad but you 
still know it's there.'

Her father Larry Poret added: 'We were asked to use plastic bags to go to the bathroom and then used the shower. Sewage is going from one floor to the next... Passengers are wading in it.'

Allie also said the conditions are unbearable, and admitted she 'had to do my business in a can'.

The cold is also getting her down - especially as she admitted to CNN that she forgot to bring a jacket on board as she assumed the climate would be tropical. She said there is no heat inside the vessel.

Thankfully her friend Ally gave her a
 spare and many people are wearing bathrobes to ward of temperatures 
reaching 46 degrees Fahrenheit outside the ship.

'They're trying to make the best of it 
but you can see how much they really dislike the situation,' she said. 'And how 
could you like the situation? You really can't.'

Even though the ship is slowly being tugged to the shoreline, she said she feels as if they are making no progress.

'I know we're moving a little bit but I really don't feel anything,' she said.

Mary Poret, who is waiting for her daughter and ex-husband in Mobile along with Allie's mother, previously told CNN that she had had sporadic contact with Rebekah.

The Carnival Triumph is expected to dock tonight in Mobile, Alabama between 8pm and 11pm (ET).

Custom and borders patrol agents are currently sailing out to meet the ship to speed up the process when the boat finally docks.

Carnival said that 200 staff members, including a 'care team', will be highly visible at the port to help their exhausted and grubby passengers.

Medical teams will also be on hand for anyone who needs health care.

They will first set foot in a terminal which has been disused for more than a year.

Despite landing in Mobile, a city which has hundreds of hotel rooms and two airports, passengers will then either board buses directly to Galveston or Houston in Texas.

The other option is to spend the night in a New Orleans hotel room. Those who opt to stay in New Orleans will catch flights to Houston on Friday.

Guests have already indicated which option they prefer to Carnival.

Carnival VP Terry Thornton said today that it as not 'logistically feasible' for passengers to remain in Mobile because of the volume of flights required.

Carnival said it will cover all transportation costs.

'She was hysterical, crying hysterically,' Mrs Poret said. 'She was scared. She don't know what was going to happen next.

'And what broke my heart the very most was her saying, "Mommy, I don't 
know if I'll ever see you again," and that's really hard to hear from 
your 12-year-old daughter.'

The Carnival Triumph is expected to finally reach dry land on Thursday between 8pm-11pm (ET).

The ship is now in view from shore - 
but those on board are being forced to wait up to ten hours before they 
land in Mobile as the powerless ship battles high winds and strong 
currents.

The boat is crawling along at the rate of six to seven knots, about the pace of a lawnmower.

It
 is a further frustration for the 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew 
members who have endured four days stranded at sea in the Gulf of Mexico
 after a fire in the engine room crippled the power system.

On
 the top deck, a 'shanty town' has sprung up with passengers sleeping on
 sun loungers, wrapped in bedsheets to stay warm as temperatures dropped
 to 46F.

Despite the fact 
it rained all night, passengers opted to sleep outdoors because the 
stench of sewage has become so unbearable on board.

Medical teams are stationed at the docks to help any passengers who might need emergency healthcare.

Doctor Jorge Rodriguez said the Trumph was a 'floating petri dish' because of the combination of circumstances on board.

He
 told CNN: 'So far there hasn't been an outbreak of anything, but ... 
it's in the Gulf. It's warm. You don't have sanitary conditions, so 
hopefully they'll get back to shore ... before anything breaks out.'

Long journey: The ship has been stranded  for an extra four days after an engine fire broke out on Sunday

Plea: The Edmond family stuck on Carnival hold a sign after days of poor food and no showers

Carnival said in a statement late on Wednesday that passengers would be helped through customs by 200 staff members at the scene.

They were also being given the option of boarding buses directly to Galveston, Texas, or Houston, or spending the night in a hotel in New Orleans, where the company said it booked 1,500 rooms.

Those staying in New Orleans will be flown on Friday to Houston. Carnival said it will cover all the transportation costs.
