Nigel Farage is on course to win his first Commons seat after a  new poll showed UKIP leading in Eastleigh, the Hampshire constituency where the party narrowly failed to win last year’s by-election.

Support for Mr Farage’s party is running at 32 per cent in Eastleigh – four points ahead of the Conservatives on 28 per cent, and five points ahead of the Liberal Democrats, who hold the seat.

It is the first time a constituency poll has put UKIP in the lead.

UKIP founder Dr Alan Sked attacked current party leader Nigel Farage branding him a 'dim, racist alcoholic'

The boost for the party came as its founder, Dr Alan Sked, gave an astonishing interview in which he described Mr Farage as ‘alcoholic, dim and racist’ and repeated claims he first made in this newspaper a decade ago – which Mr Farage strongly denies  – that the UKIP leader had referred to black people as ‘n*****s’.

The Survation poll was carried out a year after UKIP rocked Westminster by coming within four percentage points of winning Eastleigh.

Despite his criticism, Dr Sked believes Nigel Farage (pictured) will win a seat at the next general election

The poll puts UKIP top even though Mr Farage was not suggested as the likely candidate, indicating that the party’s appeal is not necessarily dependent on his ‘personality cult’.

Earlier this month a Mail on Sunday poll in Folkestone, where the UKIP leader has hinted he might stand at next year’s General Election, put Mr Farage three points behind the incumbent Conservative MP.

But the new poll – funded by Alan Bown, a UKIP donor – indicates his best chance of winning a Commons seat might lie in three-way marginals such as Eastleigh. Dr Sked made the scathing remarks about Mr Farage during an interview published today. The London School of Economics professor also repeated a claim he made in 2004 that Mr Farage had once said: ‘We will never win the n****r vote.’

In his interview with the Parliament Street think-tank, Dr Sked also claims that Mr Farage admires  Russian president Vladimir Putin because ‘Putin is clearly a nasty piece of work and Nigel probably identifies with that’.

A UKIP spokesman said: ‘Dr Sked is free to hold whatever view he likes of our party and our leader, but his repeated claim that Nigel used the “N word” is untrue and has been vigorously denied before.’
