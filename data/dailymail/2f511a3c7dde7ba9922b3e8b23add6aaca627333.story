British personnel will be subjected to ‘tough’ regulations while aboard a medical ship deployed to tackle Ebola in West Africa, the captain said today.

A team of 750 military personnel will reach Sierra Leone by November, with a Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship leaving Falmouth Docks in Cornwall on Friday.

RFA Argus will set sail at high water, loaded with three Merlin helicopters and a crew of around 350, including 80 medics and 80 Royal Marines.

Strict rules to keep the ship ‘sterile’ from Ebola include banning personnel from going ashore on leave during up to three months of deployment.

Royal Marines who leave the RFA Argus for operations in the local community will go through a decontamination process upon their return.

Medics will take their temperatures twice a day and anyone who shows signs of Ebola will be flown to a British treatment clinic in Kerry Town.

Captain David Eagles, 52, of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, admitted the measures were ‘tough’ but necessary to safeguard against Ebola.

‘It is a ship that's there for six months but people will rotate round on a two to three month basis,’ said Capt Eagles, of Hatt, Cornwall.

‘No shore leave is unusual, it will be quite tough but I think people will understand. I think people are going to be quite busy.

‘We are working to allay fears. The point we have been getting across to our people is that Ebola patients will not be brought aboard Argus so we are a sterile unit from that.

‘The risk that people have cottoned onto is what happens if one of the ship's crew comes into contact with Ebola in the local community.’

Capt Eagles said all Royal Marines leaving the ship will be given a questionnaire on their return - with the first question: ‘Have you been in contact with a local population?’.

‘If a “yes” comes across then straight away alarm bells are ringing,’ he added. ‘His temperature will be taken twice a day and he will be well and truly monitored.

‘If he shows any signs whatsoever the level of scrutiny will increase ten-fold, our medical experts will make a decision to transport him back ashore to the UK facility at Kerry Town.’

Capt Eagles said this early detection process would mean the patient would be removed from the ship before they became infectious.

Today, 120 members of the ship's company were given a 90-minute briefing on Ebola from three medical experts inside the crew's canteen.

Dr Ruth Howlett-Shipley, the Royal Navy's Public Health Consultant, told the personnel: ‘We are doing everything we can to make sure that you go out safely and come back safely.

‘To contract Ebola you have to have direct contact with someone who is ill with Ebola.’

Dr Howlett-Shipley was asked questions including: ‘If I sit next to a Royal Marine at breakfast, who shook hands with an infected person, will I contract Ebola?’

Surg Lt Dan Hawkins, 34, from Evesham, Worcs, the medical officer on the ship, admitted members of the crew had ‘concerns’ ahead of deployment.

‘Everyone is focused and looking forward to it in a serious way but there are very genuine concerns,’ he said.

‘But it is no different to being put in harm's way in any other environment. The thing I am most worried about as the ship's doctor, is malaria.’

The ship will act in three capacities in Sierra Leone, where it is expected to remain for six months, to support the Department for International Development.

The ship, due to set sail on Friday, will not be used to treat Ebola-infected patients, but mainly to transport supplies and ferry personnel

It will provide three Merlin helicopters to transport equipment in the country, as well as allowing Royal Marines to safely move stores into areas they are required.

The 35-year-old former container ship will also act as a hospital for non-battle injuries and diseases for British troops, providing the same level of care as a NHS trauma hospital in the UK.

Medics such as emergency consultant surgeons, anaesthetists, ITU nurses and radiographers will have access to a wide range of diagnostic facilities including a CT scanner.

Speaking aboard the ship, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon described the ship as ‘the front line in defending Britain from this disease’.

‘This is a vital mission to save lives in Sierra Leone but also to keep Britain safe,’ he said.

‘If this outbreak is not kept under control then we will see it spread through Africa, into mainland Europe and the UK.

‘Members of the armed forces know they are putting their lives at risk all the time in all kinds of operations. 

Captain Eagles said 80 of those on board are from 820 Naval Air Squadron at Culdrose, which is also sending the three helicopters

'Their families can be reassured they have been trained properly.

‘We will be working hard to make sure that the facts about Ebola are known and there aren't any unnecessary risks for people to worry about.’

Capt Eagles said 80 of those on board are from 820 Naval Air Squadron at Culdrose, which is also sending the three helicopters.

The vessel will not be used to treat Ebola-infected patients, but mainly to transport supplies and to ferry personnel.

Capt Eagles said: 'We have a considerable education programme in place to reassure personnel and their families about how you actually catch the disease and that it's quite difficult to catch it.

'As we head south towards Sierra Leone will be doing a lot of training to make sure our plans are validated and we know how to deal with any emergency that may come our way.

'I'm confident we can deliver the mission successfully and safely and bring all our people safely back home.'

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon laid out the measures at an emergency Cobra committee meeting last week, chaired by the Prime Minister, to discuss the UK's response to the Ebola crisis, which is being led by the Department for International Development.

Mr Fallon said: 'The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is already a global threat to public health and it's vital that the UK remains at the forefront of responding to the epidemic.

'Following today's meeting we are stepping up significantly the UK's contribution and leadership in work to tackle the outbreak on land, in the air and at sea.

'At the heart of the package is the commitment to provide more than 750 personnel to help with the establishment of Ebola treatment centres and an Ebola training academy.

'We are deploying troops, helicopters and a ship - army medics and Merlin helicopters supported by RFA Argus - to provide direct support and reassurance.'
