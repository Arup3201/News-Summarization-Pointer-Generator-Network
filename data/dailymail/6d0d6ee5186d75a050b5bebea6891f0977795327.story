A 93-year-old man who was involved in a fight with a fellow care home resident died of blood poisoning.

Fred Adams was involved in the incident with a 73-year-old man last month. The two were residents at the Acorn Lodge care home in Oldham, Greater Manchester.

The home specialises in looking after those with complicated mental health needs.

Assault: Police were called to Acorn Lodge in Oldham, Greater Manchester, to reports of an assault

Officers today revealed that they were called to the home on October 22 after reports a resident had been assaulted. It is unclear who attacked whom.

Mr Adams suffered a minor injury to his hand in the incident, in which nobody except the two men were hurt.

They were both taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital with minor injuries, and were discharged the same day.

But Mr Adams was re-admitted to hospital with an infection to his hand on October 28, and died of septicaemia, or blood poisoning.

Assault: It is not clear which resident attacked which

Detective Chief Inspector Joanne Rawlinson, at GMPâ€™s Major Incident Team, said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at what a very difficult time.

'We are now investigating what, at this stage, is an unexplained death.

'It would be unhelpful to publically speculate on how this happened and we are now working closely with the home and local authority to help establish the full circumstances.

'Inquiries are continuing and we want to reassure care home residents, their families and the wider community that incidents of this nature are rare and we are doing all we can to understand what happened.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
