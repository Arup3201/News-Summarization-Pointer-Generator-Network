Harry Redknapp has said Paul Gascoigne is welcome to come and coach at QPR in an attempt to help the former England midfielder recover from problems with alcohol.

Gascoigne has been plagued by alcohol problems for years and was hospitalised yesterday after being found drunk outside his home.

But former Spurs manager Redknapp claimed he would love to help the 47-year-old and offered an open-invitation to come and coach with The Rs.

He said: 'He (Gascoigne) lives down the road from me and he's got a heart of gold. Everybody's trying to help him. 

'Everyone's tried, I'd love to bring him in if he wants to come in do some coaching with the kids. 

'That's an open invitation to him. It's so sad. He's a great lad.'

Gascoigne played 92 games during his four years at Spurs before moving to Italian side Lazio.

The QPR manager also spoke about new signing Eduardo Vargas. He said: 'He (Vargas) is a player that's been mentioned to us for a long time so when the opportunity came it was too good to miss.

'He's a real live wire - a busy player, a strong little player and we couldn't be more pleased he's joined.

He's got to get his work permit so we won't be available this week but he should be available for next week's game at Sunderland.' 

Redknapp did confirm, however, that Leroy Fer had already trained with the club and would be available for selection this weekend.

The 67-year-old also revealed that he is hopeful QPR will be able to count on the services of Loic Remy this season.

He said: 'I'm confident he (Remy) will be here (this season). He's been excellent in training and his attitudes been first class.

'I think he's enjoying himself back here and he's seen we've brought some good players in.'
