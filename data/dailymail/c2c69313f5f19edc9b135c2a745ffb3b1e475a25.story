Sophie Mattes, 20, was accused of being anorexic when she dropped from a size 12 to a size four

A 20-year-old has been diagnosed with a rare stomach disorder after dropping from a size 12 to a size four in the space of a year.

Sophie Mattes lived on just a handful of boiled sweets and three squares of chocolate a day leading doctors to assume that she had an eating disorder.

However, Sophie, who weighed nine stone before falling ill, insisted she was not suffering from an eating disorder and begged doctors to believe she was not anorexic.

In fact, she claimed she was desperate to eat more but felt constantly full and bloated despite her meagre diet.

Only her parents believed she was telling the truth and, after insisting on more tests, Sophie was finally diagnosed with gastroparesis, a condition that meant the nerve that emptied her stomach was paralysed.

Sophie was immediately admitted to hospital and tube fed before finally having a pacemaker fitted to her stomach to allow her to start eating again.

Sophie, from Edgware, Middlesex, said: ‘It was awful having nobody believe I was ill. Because I was a teenage girl losing weight quickly people just assumed I was anorexic.

‘The doctors were convinced I had an eating disorder and even tried to persuade my mum I needed help.

‘Even strangers in the street would make horrible comments about me being anorexic and tell me to eat. It was devastating.

‘Thank goodness mum and dad believed me when I told them I didn’t have an eating disorder. Mum pushed for more tests but it was still another six months before I was diagnosed.

‘It’s frustrating that any young woman losing weight is labelled anorexic.’

Sophie, a barista in a coffee shop, had a healthy appetite until she turned 18 and started struggling to finish her meals.

‘It felt like it was getting stuck in my throat and after eating I’d get stabbing pains in my stomach and feel sick,’ she explained.

Soon she felt full after just a few mouthfuls of food.

‘I wanted to eat but couldn’t so I would just pick at my meals. But even that left me uncomfortable.

‘I saw my GP a few times but they just told me to eat more and sent me away with bottles of Gaviscon.’

Eventually it became too painful to finish her meals and Sophie was surviving on boiled sweets and chocolate.

Sophie's condition means that the nerve which is meant to empty her stomach is paralysed

Sophie was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead where she was fed through a tube to help her put on weight

‘I was serving people delicious cakes
and sandwiches all day at work and wanted nothing more than to eat 
myself but I knew it would leave me in agony.

‘Only every time I want back to the doctor they said there was nothing wrong with me,’ she said.

Seeing their daughter waste away, Sophie’s worried parents Simon Mattes, 46, Laura Mattes, 43, insisted on taking her back to their GP again.

This time, Mrs Mattes was taken aside and the doctor told her Sophie was most likely suffering from an eating disorder.

Before being admitted to hospital Sophie was surviving on a few boiled sweets and a small amount of chocolate each day

She was released from hospital after three weeks but still had to be tube fed for 14 hours a day at home

Sophie said: ‘I could hear the words 
being whispered to my mum and was shocked and angry because I had 
already told them I didn’t have an eating disorder.

‘But people see a teenage girl losing weight and that is all they think. It’s a lazy assumption to make.’

Thankfully Sophie’s mother and father believed their daughter and pushed for a referral.

Even after being discharged from hospital Sophie was unable to eat normally without suffering from pain and sickness

Sophie said: ‘I was gutted when the 
first round of tests and scans came back clear and I feared that was it,
everyone would be sure I was anorexic now.

‘My weight was dropping faster than ever and I looked horrific.’

But
Sophie’s parents persisted and more tests at the Royal Free Hospital in
Hampstead in April 2012 finally revealed that she had the stomach 
condition gastroparesis.

It meant her stomach was not emptying efficiently explaining why she felt constantly bloated and full.

Sophie said: ‘Having an answer was such a relief. At last people had to believe I did not have an eating disorder. They finally knew I had been telling the truth all along.’

In September 2012, with her weight below six stone, Sophie was admitted back to the Royal Free and put on feeding tube for almost three weeks.

Even when she was well enough to be discharged, Sophie had to be tube fed via her nose at home for 14 hours a day.

‘It was horrible, the machine was inside a backpack but it made a really loud humming noise all the time,’ she said.

She gained weight but was still unable to eat normally without suffering pain and sickness.

‘I begged me specialist for an answer and he mentioned a gastric pacemaker. I’d heard of pacemakers before but not for the stomach,’ she added.

Medics explained it would help pump the food from her stomach into her intestines.

Slowly, after the operation at the end of October 2012, her appetite returned.

‘After a year of not eating it hurt so I took lots of painkillers and built up slowly to a few forks of pasta at a time,’ she said.

Now, six months after the operation, she can eat a small plate of food and continues to gain weight.

She now weighs 7st 10 and is a size six to eight.

‘I want to warn that not all young women losing weight are anorexic, please don’t be too quick to label us when there really could be a serious health problem that has nothing to do with eating disorders.

‘Believe me, I would like nothing more than to be a curvy size 12 again,’ she said. 

Gastroparesis is a chronic condition which means the stomach cannot empty itself of food normally.

Symptoms include feeling sick or full when eating, bloating and weight loss.

It is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles that control the emptying of the stomach.

The cause of the problem is usually unknown but it is most common among people with poorly managed diabetes.

It is also associated with some medications, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.
