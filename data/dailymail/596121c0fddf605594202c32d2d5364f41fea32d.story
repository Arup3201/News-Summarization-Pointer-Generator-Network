Despite admitting it was a late foul that could have left his player with a broken leg, Gus Poyet offered a defence, of sorts, for Fabian Delph, after the midfielder received Aston Villa’s third straight red in four games.

The Sunderland manager believes Delph’s reputation for tough tackling precedes him and may have contributed to his early exit for a mistimed challenge on Jordi Gomez. Poyet was Dennis Wise’s assistant at Leeds when Delph was a teenager unafraid to make his presence felt on the training pitches.

At Villa Park, his attempt to win possession three minutes after the break went wrong and instead he left his studs on Gomez’s ankle. Referee Martin Atkinson showed no hesitation in producing the red card.

‘It’s the way he plays football, his reputation,’ said Poyet. ‘Sometimes players can make three or four fouls and only get yellow, then Fabian makes one tackle that looks a little bit dangerous: boom, he gets a red. It’s unlucky.

‘Saying that, if you stop the video you will see his studs in his ankle. Another three inches it could be a broken leg. I think that’s why the referee gave it, but sometimes you get away with those.

‘I was at Leeds with him. I can tell you Dennis Wise received a few from Fab. I really like him. I feel sad for him today. I think he didn’t deserve that. It was a little bit dangerous and we need to be fair with the referee as well.’

Delph’s dismissal gave Sunderland an opportunity to snatch three points from a dire game of little quality. But even though Gomez hit the post late on with a driven shot, it was Villa with the better chances to win the game. ‘We tried too hard, went a little bit crazy,’ explained Poyet.

Paul Lambert’s side are well-versed this season in playing a man light. Against Tottenham in November, Christian Benteke’s red saw three points turn to none, while another defeat followed Kieran Richardson’s dismissal for a wild lunge on West Bromwich Albioin striker Stephane Sessegnon earlier this month.

But against Manchester United eight days ago, Villa coped impressively to hold on to a draw after being shorn of Gabby Agbonlahor with half an hour left to play. That red was later rescinded and Lambert said he would view video footage before deciding whether to appeal against Delph’s red too.

Villa limited Sunderland to scant openings, the clearest coming in the 68th minute when Adam Johnson crossed for Emanuele Giaccherini. The Italian’s attempt was blocked by his team-mate Connor Wickham, who reacted by backheeling a shot that required Leandro Bacuna to block near the line.

Lambert sent on Jack Grealish to provide some much-needed pace and the 19-year-old made the kind of impact that may see him get more minutes against Crystal Palace on New Year’s Day.

He fired a shot narrowly wide, nearly forced an own goal from Santiago Vergini and whipped a corner that Ron Vlaar met with a glancing header to test Costel Pantilimon.

Lambert appealed enthusiastically for a penalty in added time when Pantilimon collided with Benteke but Atkinson, on this occasion, was unmoved.

The point is a positive given the circumstances but another blank means Villa have scored just 11 goals in 18 games — the lowest total in the Barclays Premier League.

Lambert is concerned about the growing dismissals, but insists goals will come. Like Poyet, he said playing twice in 48 hours sapped his team’s energy.

‘Two games in three games is nonsense,’ said Lambert, before switching his focus to that worrying trend of red cards. ‘It doesn’t look great,’ he acknowledged. ‘The lads are committed to a challenge. We’re not a dirty team.’
