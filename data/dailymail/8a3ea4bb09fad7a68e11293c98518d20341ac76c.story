A truck was bombed and exploded outside Colorado City, Arizona, last weekend.

No one was injured in the recent blast, but Shane Stubbs, who used the vehicle for farm work, suspects it was part of ongoing harassment he says his family has faced since leaving the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a religious sect connected to imprisoned former leader Warren Jeffs.

'I don't know if it's FLDS trying to get back at us in some way or just kids monkeying around,' Stubbs told the Associated Press Friday. 'I'm thinking it's one of those two things.'

Efforts from the Associated Press to reach church leaders for comment were unsuccessful. The sect broke away from the mainstream Mormon Church when it disavowed polygamy more than 100 years ago.

The church is known for its practice of polygamy and multiple women have come forward, saying they were married as  young girls to adult men and endured abuse.

FDLS is also known for its incarcerated leader Warren Jeffs. Jeffs is serving a life sentence in Texas after convictions on child sex and bigamy charges. Former FLDS members who live in the community and have family members who remain followers say he maintains control of the group from behind bars.

Search: A spokesman for the Mohave County Sheriff's Office said there are no suspects at this time and there were no eye witnesses to the bombing

Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) found what 'looks like some sort of commercial explosive,' spokesman Tom Mangan told MailOnline, citing examples like dynamite or a cast booster.

Mangan said ATF investigators found an 'explosive engine compartment in front of the motor' and that samples have been sent to a lab for further testing.

There were no injuries during the explosion that destroyed the Dodge Ram, Mangan said.

Mangan directed further questions on the investigation to the Mohave County Sheriff's Office.

'Right now we have no suspects,' Mohave County Sheriff's Office Trish Carter told MailOnline. She said there were no eyewitnesses to the bombing. 

'This is not the USA. This is the Taliban,' Sally Stubbs said of the bombing to AZFamily.com.

Who did this? Stubbs had previously left the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS)

Andrew Chatwin, who filmed the damaged truck, told KUTV 'The FLDS do not like [Stubbs]. They've destroyed his crops [...] when he was leasing the land from Bruce Wisan.'

'They had that shooting at the Mohave building, now this truck being blown up,' Chatwin also said.

'These are messages, they're hate messages' from FLDS, Chatwin told the affiliate station.

Earlier this month, a bullet went through a Mohave County victims advocate's office window, St. George News reported.

Area residents who aren't members of the FLDS have told authorities they have been targets of discrimination.

A family that sued Colorado City and the neighboring Utah community of Hildale over a denied household water connection claimed the denial was made for religious reasons. The case was settled this year for an undisclosed amount after an Arizona jury awarded the family $5.2 million on its claims.

In a separate lawsuit, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged the border towns have supported a campaign of intimidation against those outside of the FLDS, denying them housing and municipal services. Attorneys for the towns have denied wrongdoing.

Shane Stubbs told the Associated Press some of his family's problems come from an ongoing land dispute. He said part of his wheat and alfalfa farm belongs to a trust fund that used to be run by the FLDS but has been in control of state of Utah for nearly a decade.

The family leases the land from the court-appointed accountant who oversees $100 million in homes and property in the border communities in the trust, Stubbs said. The truck was sitting on this disputed section with a flat tire that hadn't been repaired, he said.

'They've caused us all kinds of problems,' Stubbs said. 'They plowed up our wheat. They've run the cows and their sheep on their field.' 

Attorneys who have represented the FLDS in legal matters have said the church hasn't had a spokesperson in years. The church has no listed headquarters, and members are instructed not to speak with outsiders.

Back in June, Tom Horne, Arizona's Attorney General, said in a press release 'The disbandment of the Colorado City/Hildale Marshal’s Office is necessary and appropriate because this police department has operated for decades, and continues to operate, as the de facto law enforcement arm of the FLDS Church. We have introduced legislation for the past three years to transfer law enforcement to the Mohave County sheriff and unfortunately it has failed to pass.'

'Testimony in support of this legislation shows that when girls have tried to escape from the town, the Marshalls forced them back, and committed many other injustices,' he added. 'When the legislation failed, I found $400,000 per year to transfer to the Mohave County sheriff, to have at least one sheriff in Colorado City. As a result, girls have escaped who said they couldn’t have without the sheriff there.

'My office will not tolerate corrupt law enforcement agencies in this State, and the disbandment of what is perhaps the most corrupt police department in the history of this State will go a long way toward protecting the public from further discrimination and harm in these communities,' Horne also said.
