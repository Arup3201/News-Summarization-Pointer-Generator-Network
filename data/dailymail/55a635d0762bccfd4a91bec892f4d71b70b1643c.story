When looking for advice on how to add value to your home, the first place to go is right to the top. 

Sound opinion can be hard to come by, so Daily Mail Australia asked one of the leading experts in the industry for an insight into the often murky waters of property improvement.

Kevin McCloud, host of lauded series Grand Designs, has a vast and impressive knowledge base when it comes to exactly what makes a property stand out.

Iconic Australian architectural elements include the use of a verandah, whether this is a wraparound or just on one side.

'They [verandahs] have become an instant calling card for Australia. In architecture the sun is often a conscious design element, where the sun is shaded from the inside of the building,' McCloud said.

'There's a big push in the UK for houses that are influenced by Australian architecture,' McCloud said.

The British designer, writer, and housing developer is currently in Australia for the launch of Grand Designs Live Home Show, and took some time out with Daily Mail Australia to reveal his tips for adding value to your home.

The event is the ultimate home show for those who are looking for ideas and inspiration for all areas of your home, whether the focus is small spaces or complete overhauls, something McCloud has seen up close for over 25 years. 

McCloud, a giant in the world of architecture and design, said that Australia offered a veritable array of climates and environments, making it a unique and exciting country to build in.

'I think first of all, that Australia is such a varied place to be,' said the designer.

'It's not one climate and one place. From the country to the city, from Queensland to Tasmania, there is so much difference.'

'Some will have a much cooler climate and have sea breezes, and then another will have mountain temperatures. This means that the architecture is so radically different depending on where it is.'

'Some will have a much cooler climate and have sea breezes, and then another will have mountain temperatures. This means that the architecture is so radically different depending on where it is.'

McCloud said he is envious of Peter Maddison, the host of Grand Designs Australia, because of the amazing landscape and unique elements that the country has to offer for potential designs.

'It's hard to identify one style of design in Australia. There isn't one quality I could pinpoint, and there are such wonderful quirks to the country.'

'Travelling around cities like Sydney and Melbourne I was very struck by how the conventional typography was so different.'

McCloud identified elements such as deep masonry and overhanging verandahs as quite iconic Australian design elements.

'They have become an instant calling card for Australia. In architecture the sun is often a conscious design element, where the sun is shaded from the inside of the building.'

'This extends to contemporary 1960's and modern architecture. There's a big push in the UK for houses that are influenced by Australian architecture,' McCloud said.

An art deco property in Caulfield, Victoria. The designer said that architectural movements such as art deco are experiencing a resurgence in Australia, and was a 'badge of Australian' architecture, as well as appearing in pockets all over the world such as Miami, Prague, Portugal and South American and South Asian countries.

'It's such a rare and beautiful and odd thing,' McCloud said of the art deco movement, which influence the architecture of this Sandringham property in Victoria

'The UK didn't get to expand on [art deco] in the same way as Australia- and in New Zealand there are whole towns modeled on the style. It's got a really strong foothold in this part of the world,' said McCloud

'I have a lot of people saying, 'Oh I want my house to look like this house from Australia,' and there's a real fascination with tiny shacks, and corrugated iron sheds. Transient materials from which so much of Australian architecture is made from historically.'

McCloud said that British-born Australian architect Glenn Murcutt, who has won international awards for his designs, drew heavily upon these influences.

'It's such a rare and beautiful and odd thing,' McCloud said. 

'It's a style of architecture that Australia can certainly claim to have taken to heart and made their own,'

 'Art deco in the UK was born into such a dismal and dim time, in the recession period after the great war.'

'The UK didn't get to expand on the style in the same way as Australia- and in New Zealand there are whole towns modeled on the style. It's got a really strong foothold in this part of the world.'

Zero carbon houses, like this propery in Campbelltown, Adelaide, are the future of Australian design, said McCloud.

Sustainability is going to be a strong focus in design in the next decade, said the designer.

A 'shed house' on the Sunshine Coast: 'I have a lot of people saying, 'Oh I want my house to look like this house from Australia,' and there's a real fascination with tiny shacks, and corrugated iron sheds. Transient materials from which so much of Australian architecture is made from historically,' said McCloud.

The future of Australian architecture is going in a vibrant and dynamic direction, according to McCloud.

'As a visitor in this country it can be hard for me to put my finger on the pulse of design, but more increasingly the direction of the 'shed design' is cropping up. There are great experiments of modernism from the 60's enjoying a revival in the hands of much younger architects.'

Sustainability is going to be a strong focus in design in the next decade, said the designer.

'We you start to design in a country like this, because sustainability naturally focuses on using the local environment to cool and draw energy from, you are going to get a much wider variety of designs being created because of the different climates.' 

And what are the key ways to improve the value of your house? McCloud identified five steps for prospective property sellers to ensure you make the most of your property.

'The first is to employ good people- from designers to architects, from builders, project managers, and carpenters. Whatever the scale of your project, employ people who see the world the way you do,' he said.

'Secondly, don't get too hung up on price, but do pay attention to personal recommendations. Get friends or people you know to tell you who is worth hiring, and use local people.'

'Next, spend money on the bones of the building. Focus on the structure, the airtightness, the quality. You can always revisit the plumbing or kitchen, and most people do, but to revisit the structure is very tricky.'

'Spend money on things you touch. We live in a very visual world, and we forget that we really judge the quality of things through our fingers. It's like dining in a fine restaurant, you want it to be a pleasure. Focus on door handles, switches, tiles. Make sure they are durable, a pleasure to use and move.'

'Lastly, whatever you do, do with conviction.'

With these timeless gems of advice, McCloud said, adding value to your house is much simpler.

For more advice, the Grand Designs Live Home Show has design and styling options for all projects, and is running at the Sydney Exhibition Centre from the 24th - 26th October.

McCloud said that British-born Australian architect Glenn Murcutt, who has won international awards for his designs, such as the above property, drew heavily upon these influences.

'Whatever you do, do with conviction,' said McCloud.
