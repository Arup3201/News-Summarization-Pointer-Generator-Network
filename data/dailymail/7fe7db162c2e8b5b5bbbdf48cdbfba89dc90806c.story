Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri has quashed rumours that he has fallen out with Arturo Vidal but has warned the 27-year-old that he must improve his attitude.

Vidal was fined £78,400 by the Italian giants after having a night out ahead of their crunch Serie A match against Roma last Sunday.

The Chilean was subsequently dropped to the bench as the Old Lady won 3-2 in Turin but Allegri has stated that decision was a tactical one.

Vidal has been plagued with knee problems since the end of last season that has continued into the current campaign and Allegri cites this as one of the reasons why the midfielder was dropped against Roma.

He told La Repubblica: 'There is no rift with Vidal. He didn't play against Roma for technical reasons. He has played a lot of games and this match came in a period when he has played in fits and starts.

'He's had a knee problem and returned from the national team with flexor trouble.'

Allegri added in Tuttosport: 'What happened off the pitch had nothing to do with it -- that's a matter for the club. Now, though, he must adopt a different attitude.'

Vidal, who was strongly linked with a move to Manchester United in the summer, played the full duration of Chile's 3-0 friendly win against Peru on Friday.
