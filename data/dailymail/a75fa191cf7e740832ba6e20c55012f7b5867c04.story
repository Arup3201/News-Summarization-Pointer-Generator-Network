It may have been 200 years ago, but plans for a re-enactment of the Battle of Waterloo are reportedly being adjusted to avoid creating any tension between the British and French. 

The re-enactment of the historic defeat of the French forces, led by Napoleon Bonaparte in the battle on June 18, 1815, is due to take place next year. 

The battle was fought near Waterloo, which is now Belgium, and saw 25,000 French troops killed or wounded as the Duke of Wellington led Allied troops to victory, along with General Blücher from Prussia.  

Adjustments to a re-enactment of the 200 year anniversary of the Allied victory at the Battle of Waterloo, due to take place next year, are reportedly being made to avoid creating tension between the French and British. The battle, which saw 15,000 of Napoleon's troops killed or injured is captured in this painting from 1815

Wellington's victory over Napoleon's 72,000-strong army however was fairly close, as 15,000 of his own troops were left dead or wounded after the fighting. He acknowledged this when he described the Allied win as a 'near run-thing' when the battle ended almost 23 years of war.

And while the re-enactment will be kept historically accurate, it is claimed some adjustments have been made to ensure it is not too damaging to relations between the two countries, the Sunday Times reported.

Instead of being held on just one day the staged battle will take place over two days - with day one ending with a stronger French side. The next day 80,000 people will watch the Allied army - a coalition of British, Dutch, Belgian and German soldiers - counterattack and achieve victory. This will represent the end of hours of bloody fighting which took place in 1815. 

Napoleon may be played by Mark Schneider, an American, and around a third of his troops are likely to be from the UK. Frank Samson, a Frenchman, is also reported to be in the running to play Napoleon.

Etienne Claude, director-general of Waterloo 200 - the group organising the re-enactment - said the battle was not a defeat of the French but 'a defeat of Napoleon.' 

He said: 'The spectacle of the first day is not to win or lose by the French army. It's part of the historical reality.'

Mr Claude said there are also plans for a VIP battlefield ceremony, which will see President Francois Hollande invited along with descendants of the Duke of Wellington. 

Other proposals thought to be under consideration include head of government marking the occasion during a routine meeting of EU leaders due to be held a week later. 

However some believe the re-enactment should not be a 'watered down' version of history. Vince Law, whose great-great-great grandfather served as one of Wellington's foot soldiers said he thought the bicentary of Tralfalgar 'took political correctness too far.'  

The adjustments will not be the first time Britain has avoided damaging French pride through staging historical events. In 2005 a re-enactment of the Battle of Trafalgar saw a sea battle between red and blue teams take place, representing the French and Spanish navies and the Royal Navy. The battle was one of the most decisive naval victories, with 22 ships lost by the Franco-Spanish fleet, and none by the British.
