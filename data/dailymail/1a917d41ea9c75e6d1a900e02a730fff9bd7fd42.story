Goldman Sachs – whose boss once claimed it was ‘doing God’s work’ – has been exposed as investing in a company linked to prostitution and sex trafficking of underage girls.

The revelation plunged the U.S. investment bank into fresh embarrassment over its business ethics weeks after a former executive claimed bosses there called clients ‘muppets’.

It has emerged that a private equity fund run by the bank had taken a major stake in a  secretive company called Village Voice Media.

It owns a classified advertising website – Backpage.com – that is accused of being the biggest forum for illegal sex trafficking of underage girls in America.

Headquarters: Goldman Sachs, which owns GS Capital Partners III, has signed a deal to sell its 16 per cent stake in Village Voice Media, which owns the website, called Backpage.com

GS Capital Partners III said it had 
agreed to sell its 16 per cent stake in the media company, admitting it 
had lost much of its investment in the process. Goldman Sachs insisted 
it had grown ‘uncomfortable with the direction of the company’ and its 
inability to influence its direction.

However New York Times columnist 
Nicholas Kristof, who exposed the connection, said the bank had been 
‘mortified’ when he first inquired about its stake last week and ‘began 
working frantically to unload its shares’.

Backpage.com is estimated to have a 
nearly 80 per cent share  of online prostitution advertising in the 
U.S., worth some £2.5million a month.

It also hosts advertising forums in at least a dozen other countries including the UK.

Stake: A Goldman Sachas spokesman said the fund invested $30million in the Village Voice in 2000

In Britain, it is used by hundreds of 
prostitutes across 19 cities and regions, ranging from Devon and 
Hampshire to Sheffield and Aberdeen. Pimps reportedly use the website to
peddle underage girls, using euphemisms such as ‘petite’ to provide 
potential clients with a clue to their real age.

There have been growing calls  in the U.S. for the owners of  Backpage to drop the ‘adult’  classified section.

Critics including prosecutors, 
politicians and religious leaders say many of the adverts for so-called 
escorts are soliciting sex with children, who are sometimes substituted 
at the point of sale for the adults who have been pictured.

But anti-sex trafficking campaigners 
have been hampered in their efforts because Village Voice Media is 
privately owned and doesn’t have to reveal its owners.

Goldman Sachs invested £19million in 
Village Voice, an alternative New York newspaper, in 2000 and the stake 
was converted into a 16 per cent minority stake when the publication 
merged with another media company, New Times Inc, in 2006.

Since then a Goldman managing director, Scott Lebovitz, has had a seat on the board of the new company.

Village Voice Media has rejected 
demands to close down its adult adverts section, insisting the 
advertising would simply move offshore and outside the jurisdiction of 
U.S. authorities.

The company said it was co-operating 
with investigators and had reported 2,695 cases of suspected child 
trafficking to officials in 2011.

Goldman Sachs – once memorably 
described as a ‘great vampire squid’ sucking up money from wherever it 
could – has an unenviable reputation as one of the banking world’s 
greediest players.

That image was reinforced last month 
when Greg Smith, a Goldman Sachs executive director, resigned with a 
stinging attack on its ‘toxic and destructive’ culture.

Controversy: Nearly 80 per cent of the $3.1million revenue earned from online prostitution advertising has been attributed to Backpage.com by classified advertising consultant AIM Group

Protest: John Buffalo Mailer, right, whose late father, Norman Mailer, co-founded the Village Voice, demands it stop running sex ads of minors at a rally on Thursday

He said the bank regularly put its own
financial interests before those of its clients, whom bank bosses 
frequently dismissed as ‘muppets’.

Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd 
Blankfein claimed in 2009 that bankers were doing ‘God’s work’. He was 
speaking after the bank had provoked anger by revealing it planned to 
lavish a record £13.4billion in pay and bonuses on its staff.

Defending the move just 12 months 
after bankers brought the world’s economy to the brink of collapse, Mr 
Blankfein said modern banking performed a vital function and described 
himself as just a banker ‘doing God’s work’.

‘We’re very important,’ he said. ‘We help companies to grow by helping them to raise capital.

‘Companies that grow create wealth. 
This, in turn, allows people to have jobs that create more growth and 
more wealth. We have a social purpose.’
