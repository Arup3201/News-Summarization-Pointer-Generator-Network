A convicted paedophile who fled Britain to Cambodia is behind bars again after being deported and flown back to the UK.

Former special constable Ian Bower, 48, from Bramcote, Nottinghamshire, fled the UK eight years ago for Cambodia from a probation hostel after serving time for child sex abuse crimes.

He was convicted of similar offences in 2012 in Cambodia, including paying young boys in Asia the equivalent of 8p to perform sex acts on him - and was jailed for two years.

Ian Bower, who fled the country eight years ago from a probation hostel after serving time for child sex abuse claims, was deported from Cambodia on Friday after being jailed for sex crimes in the country

Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister signed a deportation 
order and Bower was flown back to the UK on Friday.

He was joined on his flight by officers from the National Crime Agency after
 Cambodian authorities sought their assistance to ensure his safe 
deportation.

He was arrested by detectives when he landed at Gatwick Airport.

A Derbyshire police spokesman said: 'Bower was released from a Cambodian prison in late 2013.

The former special constable was arrested as he arrived back in to the UK on Friday after the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia signed a deportation order

'In January this year, Cambodian authorities arrested him in relation to a suspected passport offence.

'We are sure that the families of his victims will be pleased that he is back in prison.'

Bower was jailed at Derby Crown Court in 2004 for three years for indecently assaulting a male and gross indecency with a child and nine months for making indecent photos of children.

After being released in January 2006 on licence, the former Derbyshire police special constable was put into a probation hostel. A month later he went missing.

British authorities were notified by children's rights organisation ECPAT UK that Bower was in Cambodia in 2007 when he was arrested for abusing two brothers, aged 12 and 14, while teaching English in the country.

However, after the children withdrew their statements, the case against him was dropped and he was allowed to stay in the country.

Yesterday, Bharti Patel, chief 
executive officer at ECPAT UK, said: 'We welcome the news that convicted
 child sex offender Ian Bower has been finally arrested by Derbyshire 
Constabulary officers and returned to prison custody after deportation 
by Cambodian authorities.

'Back
 in September 2007, ECPAT UK wrote to the Home Office warning of the 
"unacceptable risk to children" that Bower posed, informing the 
Government of his whereabouts.

Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where Bower's 2012 trial was held. He was jailed  for two years for paying young boys for sex

'However, nothing was done to facilitate Bower's return and he was arrested again in 2011 for committing indecent acts on five boys aged 11 to 16, while working as an English teacher in Cambodia.

'It is clear from Ian Bower's record of convictions for sexual offences against children in Britain dating back to 2004 that he is a high-risk sex offender.

'Clearly, the failure of the British authorities to take action over an eight-year period has meant that Bower was able to travel freely to Cambodia to sexually abuse vulnerable children as young as 11 years old.'
