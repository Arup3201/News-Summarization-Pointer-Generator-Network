Residents trapped in a remote Alaskan town after two avalanches blocked the only route in on Friday could remain trapped for four more days as road crews struggle to clear the snow.

Banks of snow about 40ft high were dumped on Richardson Highway, which runs parallel to the trans-Alaska pipeline, on Friday. The weight of snow damned the Lowe River, creating a half-mile long lake filled with 500 million gallons of icy water.

Concerns that the unstable dam could breach its banks if snow is cleared too quickly has delayed efforts to reopen the vital route into Valdez, a town of 4,100 people.

The transportation department said the highway would likely remain blocked until Sunday at the earliest. City officials were due to do aerial 
surveillance of the avalanche areas today to gain a better idea of what needs to be done.

The lake created by the avalanche had been slowly draining over the past couple of days, but after receding to 1,500ft it had stopped, a spokeswoman for the transport department said.

Crews have not removed snow downstream for fear of collapsing the snow dam and causing a dangerous surge of icy water. Residents living in a 10-mile radius were asked to evacuate their homes and a police siren has been set up to warn if the banks break.

Although the road is blocked, residents of Valdez still have access to air and sea routes. A helicopter has been airlifting in supplies and the postal service is reportedly still working.

On Wednesday, road crews used explosives fired from a 105mm howitzer to clear one section of road that had been covered by the second avalanche, and a further 24 miles of highway has been reopened.

The avalanches were triggered after 11in of rain fell on deep mountain snow. The snow blocked the highway, with piles of snow up to 100ft high, near Thompson Pass and Keystone Canyon.

Despite the only road in being closed, a couple from Copper Center, which is about 100 miles away, managed to hike through the avalanches to get their sick cat to the town's vet.

Kristina Clark and Donney Carlson were able to get life-saving treatment their pet, Ninja, needed, but the couple were also arrested for ignoring police who told them not to enter the avalanche zone.
