Isn't the English language marvellous?

Some wouldn't say so, but for 20 years traditional British words have slowly been replaced by Americanisms.

And now, words like 'marvellous' have been usurped by the US clich√©: 'awesome'.

Not keeping to the book? Britons are gradually abandoning traditional words for Americanisms like 'awesome'

The gradual change, charted by researchers at Cambridge University and Lancaster University, has also seen the decline of 'cheerio', 'pussy cat', 'marmalade' and 'fortnight', which are now barely used by anglophones.

While in the 1990s we were captivated by 'Walkmans', today it has been replaced by the likes of 'online' and 'smartphone'.

Other words like 'catalogue' and 'drawers', which were also regulars of the 1990s, have had to make way for 21st century sayings like 'Facebook', 'internet', 'Google', 'essentially' and 'treadmill'.

Figures show that in 2014 the word 'awesome' appears 72 times per million words compared to 'marvellous', which has fallen in use from 155 times per million 20 years ago to only two times per million today.

Researchers believe the digital revolution and America's growing influence on our culture have dramatically changed the way British people speak.

Decline: Words like 'fortnight', 'cheerio', and 'pussy cat' are also on their way out of general speech

Language expert Professor Tony McEnery, from the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science (CASS) at Lancaster University, said: 'These very early findings suggest the things that are most important to British society are indeed reflected in the amount we talk about them.

'New technologies like Facebook have really captured our attention, to the extent that, if we're not using it, we're probably talking about it.

'The rise of 'awesome' seems to provide evidence of American English's influence on British speakers.'

These are only the initial findings from a small pilot of the project, named the 'Spoken British National Corpus 2014', which is now underway.

Prof McEnery said: 'We need to gather hundreds, if not thousands, of conversations to create a spoken corpus so we can continue to analyse the way language has changed over the last 20 years.

'We are calling for people to send us MP3 files of their everyday, informal conversations in exchange for a small payment to help me and my team to delve deeper into spoken language.'

It is an ambitious project. Prof McEnery said: 'It has not been completed to this scale in the UK since the early 1990s.

'That data, which is now out of date, is still used by researchers from around the world today, so we know there is a real appetite for research of this kind.

'It is of great importance to collect new recordings from the 2010s in order to understand the nature of British English speech as it is today and not how it was more than two decades ago.'

Using the 'Spoken British National Corpus 2014', the team at Lancaster University and Cambridge University Press will be able to shed light on the way our spoken language changes over time.

The research also allows analysis into language used in different regions, between genders and across different age groups.

Fortnight.
 The word 'fortnight' appears to have declined between the 1990s and 
2010s. Instead, the phrase 'two weeks' is much more popular now than it was
 in the 1990s, and serves a similar function. Perhaps 'fortnight' is 
nowadays perceived as slightly vaguer than two weeks - perhaps there is a
 need to be more specific about our arrangements these days, or in 
accounts of things that have happened in the past.

Poll. The word 'poll' refers almost exclusively to 'poll tax' in the 1990s 
data, which shows how things that are important to us in society, at any
 time, shape our language use. The difference is simply that 'poll tax' 
was replaced with another form of tax in the 1990s.

Pussy
 cat. In the 1990s data, almost half of the time people talked about 
cats, they called them pussy cats. In the 2010s data, people appear to 
talk about cats no less than previously. The difference is that the 
modifier pussy has been dropped. One hypothesis, which I cannot verify, 
is that the word pussy has become too strongly associated with sexual 
terminology for people to feel comfortable using in other contexts.

Cheerio. The
 word 'cheerio' was used commonly as a parting phrase in the 1990s data. 
This word cannot be found in the data we have collected so far from the 
2010s. We expect elderly people to still use it but not youngsters.

Essentially.
 The use of the word 'essentially' has risen dramatically between the 
1990s and 2010s. It appears to have broadened in meaning, being used in 
contexts where you might otherwise expect the word really.

Treadmill.
 This word does not occur in the 1990s data. Without further analysis it
 is hard to make any conclusions, but it could be part of a wider trend 
of increased health awareness in society.
