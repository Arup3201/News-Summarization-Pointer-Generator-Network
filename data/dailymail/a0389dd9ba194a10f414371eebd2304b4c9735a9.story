A house described as 'one of the worst cases of hoarding ever seen', has been cleared after officials discovered five refrigerators filled with food so rancid it had liquefied and five dead cats among the squalor.

Armed with a court-signed abatement warrant, Las Vegas officials began hauling away items from Kenneth Epstein's home on Friday after they found materials stacked from floor to ceiling inside and declared it uninhabitable.

'It's a very tragic situation, but it's also tragic for the neighbors,' Councilman Stavros Anthony said.

City spokesman David Riggleman said 
Epstein, 55, had created a space for himself to crawl on top of the 
materials, but wouldn't have been able to walk upright in the house at 
the Sun City Summerlin retirement community.

Last
 week, building code officials went to the home but couldn't enter 
because there was so much stuff blocking the door. They had to take the 
door off the hinges to enter.

Riggleman
 said ten truckloads of stuff were removed by Saturday afternoon and the
 cleanup continued Sunday. In all, a private removal company was working
 with officials to remove about 15 truckloads of materials.

Nine cats have been captured by animal 
control officers as authorities called it the worst case of hoarding 
they have ever seen.

Epstein declined to comment. 'You can write whatever you like about me,' he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

He has been cooperative except when 
he locked himself in the house on Friday when workers tried to enter to 
remove stuff authorized under the warrant.

Items
 that Epstein wants to keep will be put in two storage bins and 
fumigated. If he doesn't pay for the cleanup, the city will file a lien 
against his house, making him unable to sell until the debt is settled.

Epstein has received eight citations from the city about the hoarding since 2007. According to neighbors, the problem became more severe the last two years as materials also piled up in his front courtyard and back patio.

Epstein became the owner in 2010 after his mother died. People often become hoarders because of trauma in their life, according to experts.

'This probably won't be the last episode. We understand we may have to return,' Riggleman said.
