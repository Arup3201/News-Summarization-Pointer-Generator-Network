Raheem Sterling was too tired to start in England's 1-0 win over Estonia - and now it seems his burnout extends to having to get a lift to training.

Liverpool and England team-mate Jordan Henderson drove Sterling home after a session at their Melwood training base ahead of Sunday's trip to the 19-year-old's former club QPR.

Sportsmail understands the England midfield pair joined Steven Gerrard, Mario Balotelli, Glen Johnson and Jose Enrique in a stripped-down training session with the likes of Joe Allen and Simon Mignolet still away on international duty.

Roy Hodgson left Sterling out of the starting line-up for England's 1-0 win over Estonia in Euro 2016 qualifying on Sunday after the young playmaker complained of feeling tired.

Sterling has become a key player for club and country this season and his increased time on the field appears to be taking its toll on the Liverpool star.

Hodgson is expected to hold talks with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers this week regarding their shared use of Sterling - and he could be left out of the trip to QPR on Sunday if deemed too tired again.

Sterling views criticism of him for complaining of tiredness as unfair after a difficult start to the new campaign - and appeared to speak out on Twitter against his detractors.

After coming off the bench in Tallinn, Sterling was fouled for the free-kick that led to Wayne Rooney's second-half winner that secured a perfect start to England's qualifying group with three wins from three games.
