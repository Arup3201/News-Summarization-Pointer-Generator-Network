Federal scientists investigating an unusually high number of dead bottlenose dolphins washing up on the East Coast said on Thursday the carcasses are showing up at a rate that is seven times higher than usual.

More than 120 dead animals have been discovered since June from New Jersey to Virginia, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Fisheries Service said.

Federal scientists have declared it an 'unusual mortality event' and are investigating the cause, said Maggie Mooney-Seus of NOAA Fisheries.

Scientists are working to unravel the cause of a surge in the number of dolphin deaths as a number of stranded mammals have been found beached along East Coast US states

A number of things can cause dolphins to strand, including harmful algal blooms, infectious viruses, injuries due to ship strikes, pollutants and human-made runoff, NOAA said.

Although the cause has not been determined, early tissue analysis showed that one suspect could be morbillivirus, a disease similar to measles, said Teri Rowles, national marine mammal stranding coordinator for NOAA Fisheries.

Marine stranding response centers are collecting information on the deaths and necropsies are being performed, but it could take several weeks to determine what led to the deaths, the NOAA said.

In this month alone, 28 dolphins were found dead along the shores of the East Coast.

In 1987, more than 740 animals died of morbillivirus on the coast from New Jersey to Florida

It has been 25 years since the last large die-off of dolphins along the U.S. coast. In 1987, more than 740 animals died of morbillivirus on the coast from New Jersey to Florida.

Scientists warned the public not to 
approach the animals if they see one stranded because they could harbor 
an infectious disease.

They ask that dead or stranded mammals in the Northeast be reported to NOAA's marine mammal stranding network at 1-866-755-6622.

Bottlenose dolphins live in pods of 
between two and 15 creatures off the East Coast of the US and spend the 
majority of the year in the warmer southern waters, before moving to the
 bays of the Mid-Atlantic between may and October.
