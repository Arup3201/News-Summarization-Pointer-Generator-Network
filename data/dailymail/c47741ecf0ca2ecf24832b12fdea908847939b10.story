Louis van Gaal admits Manchester United do not have the look of Premier League title contenders despite spending more than £150million on new players this summer.

Van Gaal's first task after taking over at Old Trafford was to guide United back into the Champions League and his team occupied fourth place for the duration of the international break.

The Dutchman completes a relatively kind introduction to life in English football with a trip to West Bromwich Albion, but that is followed by games against Chelsea and Manchester City.

Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has had some mixed results at Old Trafford so far this season 

Although Ander Herrera could return at The Hawthorns with the help of a corset to protect his broken rib, the Spaniard is the only one of nine injured players expected to feature.

Asked if United would be contenders with a fully-fit squad that now includes Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, Van Gaal replied: 'You have your hopes but I do think there are stronger teams in the world now.

'We have to make a team and that's why I have a period of three years. I hope we can fulfil the dream we have. Chelsea has already a lot of time.

'When you have three months with 10 players injured you cannot have a big progression. You are always playing with a different team.

'I don't think that 11 points out of seven games is better than I expected. I think it is good enough to be in fourth place and nothing more.'

Van Gaal believes he can draw on his bittersweet experience as Bayern Munich coach to turn United into challengers again.

After his first back-to-back wins in the Premier League, it perhaps seems odd that the 63-year-old should be discussing turning points but Van Gaal did not enjoy watching United hang on for successive 2-1 wins over West Ham and Everton at Old Trafford. He is demanding a significant improvement.

Van Gaal sees similarities with his brief reign at Bayern Munich five years ago when he struggled to impose his philosophy on the players, risking the sack as the club suffered their worst start in 15 years while he tinkered with the line-up and tactics.

Van Gaal signed Dutch star Daley Blind from Ajax for £14million during the summer 

His plans came together in an emphatic Champions League win over Juventus in Turin which saved his job and kick-started the club's season. Bayern went on to win a league and cup double, although they lost to Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League final.

'Do you remember when we had our revival?' said Van Gaal, who asked for three months before he was judged at United. 'We won 4-1 at Juventus, a fantastic game, and that gave us that psychological benefit.

'That was the end of November. There is still a month to go. But then it will be four months — I'm sorry. It was very stupid to say three months because you are only talking about three months.

'It is the performance that counts. Always the performance goes up and down. When that date or match is (that gives us a lift), is dependable.'

Van Gaal is concerned United flagged in the last half-hour against West Ham and Everton. Indeed, a club renowned for late goals are yet to score after the 63rd minute all season.

He added: 'It's the game, it's the style, it's the formation, it's the philosophy that we have to judge and not the points because the points are coming. Against Everton we could not say it was very good. The first hour maybe, but a game lasts 90 minutes.

'Fitness is maybe a point because I have said that I have adapted my intensity of training sessions to a lower level. But I think we are fit enough because what I see of my players they are fighting to the last minute. They are willing to do everything, so I'm very happy with their passion.

'We have to learn to kill the game and you cannot do that with one or three or eight players. We have to do it with 11 players and all of them have to think the same otherwise you lose balls unnecessarily and then are going back instead of forward. That's what we have to do but that takes time.'
