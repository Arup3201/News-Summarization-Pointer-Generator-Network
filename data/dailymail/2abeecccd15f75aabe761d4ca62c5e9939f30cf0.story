Former escort, Jenny Thompson, has revealed she is six months pregnant but she will have to do a DNA test to make sure the identity of the father

Former escort Jenny Thompson, who famously enjoyed a sexual liaison with Wayne Rooney, has revealed she is pregnant.

But it is claimed Miss Thompson, 23, who admits sleeping with more than 100 men, said she will have to take a DNA test to confirm the identity of the father.

The former vice girl, who claimed she bedded Manchester United star Rooney while his wife Coleen was five months pregnant with their son Kai, is already six months pregnant.

She told The Sun newspaper: ‘Quite a few men will be trying to work out if it is them.’

She also admitted it ‘made her laugh’ to think different men would be trying to decide if they were the father.

Her baby girl is due on Christmas Day. A Sun newspaper source said the mother-to-be believed the father was one of five possible candidates.

Miss Thompson is renowned for her flings with superstar football stars, including Rooney’s Manchester City rival Mario Balotelli.

She said Balotelli surpassed Rooney in 'every way' but that he also impressed her with his intelligence and sense of humour.

The pair met five times and had sex with her twice behind the back of Balotelli's girlfriend Raffaella Fico.

She rated Balotelli as one of her top 10 best lovers but was less complimentary about Rooney, who she claimed in 2010 paid her £1,200 a night for sex.

Shortly before Miss Thompson began her fling with Balotelli, 22, she spent the night with television dwarf Josh Bennett after bumping into him in Manchester.

She said sleeping with the 4ft5in actor was a ‘big mistake’ because it was ‘one-night stand’.

Mr Bennett, who appeared in Channel 4 reality show Seven Dwarves, said she had been impressed by his appearances in the Harry Potter films and that it was ‘obvious’ she fancied him.

Speaking about the father of her unborn child, Miss Thompson added: ‘If they work it out they’ll know. Mario and Josh might be worried – they will have to do the maths.’

She said she did a pregnancy test two months ago after feeling ‘bloated’, but it came back negative.

It was only when she went to her GP after she had grown bigger that she was given the shocking news.

Miss Thompson, who signed up to an 
escort agency at the age of 19 under the name ‘Juicy Jeni’, claimed 
Rooney slipped away from his £4.5million mansion in Cheshire to meet her
 at Manchester’s five-star Lowry Hotel seven times – including for a 
threesome with fellow prostitute Helen Wood, 25.

As the alleged sexual liaison happened in 2009, Rooney cannot be the father of Miss Thompson's unborn child.
