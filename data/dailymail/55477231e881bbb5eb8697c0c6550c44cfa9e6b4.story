An officer has died in violent clashes between police and anti-government protestors in Bangkok.

The demonstrators, some armed with sling shots, threw rocks and attempted to break through police lines.

Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets but at least 66 people were injured, according to the government, several of which required hospitalisation.

It is unclear how the policeman died but he was airlifted to hospital after receiving a bullet wound in the violence.

Thailand's Election Commission urged the government to delay polls scheduled for February 2 after the unrest, adding to political uncertainty splitting the country.

The government headed by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra is insisting the polls should go ahead, believing they will return her to power with a renewed mandate.

But the protest movement seeking to oust her is demanding that the vote be delayed until she leaves office and reforms are implemented. They have vowed to disrupt the elections if they go ahead.

In the past, the government has indicated it doesn't have the authority to delay elections, which constitutionally must be held between 45 to 60 days from the date that parliament is dissolved.

Thailand has been wracked by political conflict since Yingluck's brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was toppled by a 2006 military coup.

The protesters accuse Yingluck of representing Thaksin, who lives in self-imposed exile to avoid jail time for a corruption conviction but still wields influence in the country.

On Wednesday, Yingluck announced a proposal for a national reform council to come up with a compromise to the crisis, but it was rejected by the protesters. 

Earlier in the year the government proposed a plan which would allow Thaksin to return to Thailand a free man, which created further mistrust in the country's leaders.
