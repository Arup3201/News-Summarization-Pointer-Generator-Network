Being backed into a corner is the kind of scenario that instinctively appeals to Andy Murray, and on Tuesday night he duly came out fighting to keep his hopes alive at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.

Buoyed by the unconditional support of nearly 18,000 in London's O2 Arena, knowing that defeat would effectively end his season, the 27 year-old Scot defused the sometimes erratic power of Canadian Milos Raonic.

His 6-3, 7-5 victory was a far more convincing display than he managed in his opener against Kei Nishikori and keeps him in the hunt for a semi-final place when he plays Roger Federer on Thursday in the last round robin stage.

'On Sunday there was not much magic, but today I came up with some good shots at the right moment,' he said.' Milos did not serve as well as he can and that helped. It is always a pleasure to play against Roger - I am looking forward to it. He is one of the greatest ever. I will need to play well to get through.' The mathematics of qualification now becomes infernal and, depending on the outcome of Nishikori's singles against Raonic, he could still beat the Swiss master and go out.

In fact 16 different permutations of results present themselves on Thursday, but by the time he goes on court  he will know exactly what he has to do. With Tuesday night's straight sets triumph Murray ensured that the Swiss is not automatically through, despite him earlier registering his second win with a 6-3, 6-2 win over the Japanese.

Federer needs to win just one set to make the semis, and given that he has beaten Murray relatively easily on all three occasions he has met him in East London it will be a tall order for the Scot. Calculators may need to be at the ready, although if Raonic wins any kind of victory will be enough for the British player.

After careering round Asia and Europe to try and qualify for this event – battling against the odds again bringing out his best - a place in the last four would be fitting reward for the British number one. There is plenty to do yet as Federer has looked very impressive and he never drops his intensity for this occasionally testy rivalry.

Raonic's his hair obediently stood to attention as usual on Tuesday, but luckily for Murray his overall game was less orderly.

For the most part the Scot tended towards the solid rather than spectacular, but with the Canadian's first serve missing half the time and his forehand contributing 23 unforced errors he created enough openings to squeeze through.

The evening crowd was notably more partisan than Sunday, and if Murray was seeking assurance that not everyone down south has deserted him in the wake of his nationalist leaning tweeting activity in September then this was it.

He seemed to feed off that, having looked flat on Sunday. After missing two break points in the fourth game poked back a 136 mph serve at 3-2 on another break point which Raonic obligingly sent back beyond the baseline.

When Murray went ahead for 2-1 in the second all the momentum was on his side, only for his habit of handing breaks straight back to resurface, and the Canadian duly levelled.

The confidence seeped back into Raonic and Murray, his language occasionally matching the blue court colour, was forced to cling on as his opponent produced his best tennis.

Then the home player pulled out two brilliant defensive backhands from being way out of position and that gave him what turned out to be the decisive break. Serving it out was not comfortable, but one last wayward Raonic forehand did the trick.

Earlier Federer had passed more landmarks in his remarkable career when he notched what was his 70th win of the season. Nobody as old as 33 has scored that many victories in a year, as far back as ATP records go, and he is now only seven off completing a thousand over his whole career.

He was again utterly convincing as he kept alive his slender hopes of usurping Novak Djokovic for the year end number one ranking. He said he was already delighted with the sheer volume of wins achieved in this rebound season: 'I think it (70) is a great number. I played only the big tournaments this year, I chased all the Masters events, the Grand Slams. It's not easy to win in them because the margins are small.'
