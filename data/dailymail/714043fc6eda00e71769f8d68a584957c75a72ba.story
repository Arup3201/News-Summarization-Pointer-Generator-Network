Most new fathers feel so clueless when it comes to newborn babies that they are anxious when first handed their own child after birth.

Moreover, as many as one in five British fathers admit never having held a baby before their own was placed in their arms - and 30 per cent say they have no idea at all how to hold an infant.

This has led to 90 per cent of men confessing they were desperate for more practical parenting information to have been available when their children were born, according to research by Persil.

In contrast to new mothers, dads admit feeling inexperienced, suffering a confidence crises when their baby arrives.

Compared to women, it takes 19 per cent of new fathers an 
average of one week to feel comfortable holding their little one, while 
62 per cent of new mothers feel it is a natural instinct from day one.

And 60 per cent of new dads admit their lack of knowledge left them feeling anxious as they were handed their youngster.

The study, carried out by Persil Non-Bio and Comfort Pure, has led to the brand teaming up with England rugby player and father of twin girls Ben Cohen, 34, to create the Cuddle Mastery Guide.

Endorsed by the British Skin Foundation, the guide provides tips and examples for new parents.

Cohen emphasised the need for new mums and dads to conquer their anxieties about holding newborns.

He said: 'I want to encourage new parents to overcome their nervousness. As a father of two twin daughters, I know it can be intimidating when you first meet your little one.

'But spending that quality time with them learning how to cuddle and reading up beforehand really helps to increase your confidence.'

The study found 40 per cent of dads are not left alone with their baby in the first week after their birth.

However, many fathers are more likely to cover the night feed, which is when they begin to bond with their baby.

Meanwhile, more than half of all new parents (57 per cent) admit feeling uncomfortable letting friends and family hold their newborn.

Jean Robinson, a children's dermatology nurse and trustee for the British Skin Foundation, has stressed the importance of forming close bonds early-on.

She said: 'The quality of parent-baby relationships influences your baby's physical and mental development, so it's very important to get it right from the beginning.

'Babies who are given lots of cuddles and love and affection may find stress or anxiety easier to deal with as they grow up.'
