European human rights judges have been accused of ‘alerting’ radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada to the fact he still had time to lodge a last-ditch appeal against deportation.

Furious Home Office sources last night claimed that it was the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) itself that privately told Jordanian-born Qatada that there was still the possibility of an appeal

But they say there was no similar attempt by the Strasbourg-based court to warn Home Secretary Theresa May of the impending deadline.

Tip-off: Was Abu Qatada (right) told about his right to appeal?

Senior sources in Mrs May’s department told The Mail on Sunday that the ECHR had reminded Qatada last Monday that he still had the option to appeal.

One said: ‘They took it upon themselves to go to Qatada’s legal team and say, “You haven’t appealed yet. Are you likely to appeal?” ’

Last night, the ECHR, headed by British judge Sir Nicolas Bratza, declined to comment on the claim.

But Tory MPs denounced the court for ‘an outrageous and partisan’ interference with the UK’s internal affairs and called on the Government to demand  a ‘detailed explanation’ of the court’s actions.

Home Secretary Theresa May was trying to look on the bright side yesterday as she stepped out in a vivid checked jacked.

She
 wore the Vivienne Westwood creation – a favourite item she has been 
seen in before – as she ended a bad week with a day at the races 
alongside the Queen.

They 
were marking the start of the flat racing season at Newbury Racecourse, 
which was hosting a free meeting for NHS staff and emergency services 
workers.

The
 under-pressure Minister complemented her vivid ensemble with  a red 
fake crocodile-skin handbag and brown patent leather shoes.

Mrs
 May is known for her bold fashion taste, including leopard-print kitten
 heels and a pale blue jacket likened to a Thunderbirds uniform.

Qatada’s late-night appeal last Tuesday –
 just hours after he was arrested and detained as part of plans to 
deport him to Jordan – stunned Mrs May, who thought the deadline had 
fallen at midnight on Monday.

The Home Secretary, who still insists her interpretation was correct, was branded incompetent by critics and ridiculed for ‘not knowing what day it is’.

The source added: ‘It’s extraordinary that they decided to alert his team that the appeal deadline was coming up. But they did not bother to remind us.’

Mrs May last night declined to comment on the claims.

To add further embarrassment, it emerged today that efforts to remove Qatada from the UK could take up to 18 months as the government faces becoming snarled up in complex legal arguments.

The cleric's fate currently rests with a five-strong panel of senior judges who will decide within the next three months whether to pass his case to the ECHR's highest body, the 'Grand Chamber'.

If this happens, legal experts warn it could take 12-18 months before a decision on his status is made.

Qatada's lawyers are believed to be planning a two-pronged bid to keep him in the country.

First, they would look to revoke the deportation order while preparing an appeal through the immigration courts if this failed.

If Mrs May intervened, it is understood they would then seek a judicial review of her actions.

Proceedings will be further complicated by their attempts to contest four aspects of his deportation.

In the meantime, his lawyers will attempt to have him released from a high-security unit in Belmarsh prison.

Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of probation union Napo, told The Observer: 'There are four major problems that need addressing by the Home Office before any deportation can be made.

'This will see the process take many months to resolve if not longer.'

But Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has brushed off the delay as 'no big deal'.

'The key thing is when do we get the decision which we want,' he said.

Tory MPs, who have already demanded the UK pulls out of the ECHR regime, said the court’s behaviour in tipping off Qatada was ‘the final straw’.

Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the party’s powerful backbench 1922 committee, said: ‘If it is the case that the ECHR alerted Qatada he could still appeal, it is disgraceful.

‘It would amount to a partisan interference suggesting that the ECHR’s sympathies lie with Abu Qatada – not with the  British people. It really does demonstrate what a morally bankrupt outfit this court is.’

False: Abu Qatada's lawyer, Gareth Peirce, insists there was no 'tip-off'

Fellow Tory Rob Wilson said: ‘It 
would be extraordinary if human rights judges in Strasbourg had tipped 
off Qatada’s legal team.

‘It should never be the 
business of a court to prompt one side of a legal dispute. It brings 
into question the court’s neutrality and independence.

‘It could severely compromise the ECHR and its future determinations both in this case  and others.

‘The
 Government must immediately seek a detailed explanation of what has 
happened, what and when interactions with Qatada or his team took place,
 and reassurance that the court has not behaved improperly.’

A spokeswoman for the ECHR yesterday said she was unable to comment on any ‘alleged contacts’ between the court and Qatada’s team. Qatada’s lawyer Gareth Peirce last night denied they had been tipped off by the ECHR.

An Islamist terror group has threatened a wave of attacks in Britain if Qatada is deported to Jordan, where he was convicted in his absence of involvement in terrorist attacks in 1998.

The cleric’s fate now rests with a five-strong panel of judges in Strasbourg who will decide whether to pass his case to the court’s ‘Grand Chamber’, the ECHR’s highest body. If they accept his appeal, there are fears it would undermine the prospects of sending 14 other terrorists home.

Tim Farron, the Liberal  Democrat party president, last week said he was ‘absolutely certain’ Qatada should be put ‘on a plane as soon as possible’.

But the MP added: ‘I take the view there’s been an Olympic-standard screw-up here, whether it’s with the European Court, or with Theresa May.’
