The military officer in charge of planning for the Olympics has warned that it could take two years for the armed forces to recover from the burden of deploying extra troops at the Games.

Wing Commander Peter Daulby also said the Games showed that the forces needed to be large enough to respond to emergencies.

His comments come after thousands of troops were drafted in to plug gaps left by private firm G4S, which failed to provide enough security guards to protect Olympic venues.

Duty: It will take the armed forces two years to recover after extra personnel were deployed to the Olympics, a senior military officer has claimed

They are likely to be interpreted as a veiled attack on politicians who seek to cut the size of the military to save money.

Wing Cdr Daulby said: 'It just shows you the dangers of pulling the military down.'

The senior officer said the deployment of extra officers had been a 'game changer' that had a major impact on the armed forces.

'We were originally planning to provide niche capabilities,' he told the Guardian.

'When the requirement for venue security was doubled, that was a bit of a game changer.

'We had to generate 18,000 people. That 
does not mean that there are 18,000 spare people. It means that the 
Government has prioritised (the Olympics).

'It will take two years to recover from this, to get back to normal, to get everything back into kilter.

'You can’t expect them to go back to normal routine very easily.'

G4S had a contract to provide 10,400 guards for the Olympics, but Army, Navy and RAF personnel had to step in after it failed to meet its targets.

Some 3,500 troops were committed initially, but the Government had to draft in a further 1,200 as the opening ceremony approached.

Wing Cdr Daulby said the Olympics showed 'the country needs a military for more than war fighting'.

He added: 'It just shows you the dangers of pulling the military down. I am sure that there are some people who think that if we are a smaller military power we will be less likely to get involved in international operations.

'If we shrink the military, do we really understand what we are losing?

'Look at the speed with which we pushed up the throttle. It proves the military offers the country a huge amount of resilience.'

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the failure by G4S to meet the security requirements illustrated the different approaches taken in the private and public sector.

'I still think that, in general, there’s a lot that the public sector still has to learn from the way private sector does things,' he told the Independent.

'But, the story of G4S and the military rescue is quite informative because as two models of how to approach a problem you could not get two greater extremes than the G4S model and the military model.

'The G4S model says here is a cost envelope within which I have to deliver an outcome and therefore I have to do it incredibly leanly.

'I have to do it with very little 
resilience. So G4S were literally hiring people and expecting to deploy 
them three days later, into a live situation; trying to build up a 
management structure overnight, at the beginning of the operation.

'A
very lean structure, with lots of dependence on self-motivation by the 
people in the workforce; scheduling their own shifts, for example, by 
accessing an internet site.

'The military comes at it from the exact opposite extreme. What’s the job that needs to be done?

'Ok, we’ll do it. Whatever it takes we’ll pour in massive over-resourcing, massively heavy structures of management.'

Mr
Hammond added: 'What the military primarily deliver is contingent 
capability and I haven’t been able to think of a single large-scale 
example where a private organisation delivers a contingent capability.

'You pay for it, year in, year out, but you probably never use it for what it’s designed for.'

A
Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'The defence contribution to the 
Olympics was always planned to avoid an impact on current operations.

'So,
while some individual training and leave may need to be rescheduled, 
this will be managed and will not impact on operations including the 
ongoing mission in Afghanistan.

'Given the scale and importance of 
this once in a generation event, including the forthcoming Paralympics, 
it is right that all across government play a part in ensuring the 
success of the Games.

'This includes the armed forces who have done a fantastic job while continuing to deliver on other standing tasks and duties.'

Police officers claimed that the G4S debacle showed that the involvement of private firms in policing carried risks.

Hampshire
Police Federation chairman John Apter urged Home Secretary Theresa May 
to 'think long and hard before handing over the public sector Crown 
jewels to the highest bidder'.

'The Police Federation has raised concerns many times over the reliance of private industry in areas such as policing,' he said.

'What the Olympic G4S debacle has shown is that we were right to be concerned.

'It
is good to see that the Defence Secretary has come out fighting for our
troops, and is now reconsidering there are limits to what private 
industry can do.'

The
federation's national vice-chairman, Simon Reed said: 'Domestic 
security must be undertaken by public servants - men and women who are 
fully trained and accountable for their actions.

'This is what the public want and what the public deserve.

'Privatisation
of policing provides no benefit to the public, delivers a detrimental 
service to local communities and arguably, if the police then end up 
stepping in again when private firms fail to deliver, an additional cost
to the taxpayer.'
