Playwright Alan Bennett and the Pet Shop Boys are among campaigners who have launched the first High Court challenge against library closures proposed by local authorities across the country.

The campaigners, from the borough of Brent in north London, today asked a judge to declare decisions to close six 'treasured' libraries in their area 'fundamentally flawed and unlawful'.

The Brent case is expected to be followed in the near future by similar challenges to closures proposed by Gloucestershire and Somerset county councils, and on the Isle of Wight.

Nick Cave, Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys and Goldfrapp are among those who have contributed to the Brent campaign costs.

Playwright Alan Bennett launched a scathing attack when he spoke at a church benefit to raise legal funds to save Kensal Rise library, one of the six under threat in Brent. He compared the loss to 'child abuse'.

Applying for judicial review, Helen Mountfield QC today argued on behalf of local residents that Brent council had failed to comply with its statutory duties when it decided to make the cuts last April.

Ms Mountfield told Mr Justice 
Ouseley, sitting at the High Court in London, that the pressure on local
authorities to cut spending in the face of significant funding cuts by 
central government was no excuse.

Brent had adopted 'a fundamentally 
flawed and unlawful approach to the making of savings in its budget' by 
starting from the false premise that library closures were inevitable.

The
council had failed to comply with equality legislation and consult 
properly with local people before rejecting the possibility of retaining
libraries through community-based projects, argued Ms Mountfield.

There was a failure to assess local needs, in particular those of children attending local schools and nurseries, she claimed.

Ms Mountfield said the case was of some public importance. It was the first judicial review claim to examine the relationship between a local authority decision to close significant numbers of libraries and the duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service.

'We say the council, and council officers, misdirected themselves as to the terms of the 1964 Public Libraries and Museums Act, or unlawfully closed their minds and failed to give full and fair consideration to whether the way to provide a comprehensive library service might be by means of a joint arrangement with third sector groups and volunteers.'

Local residents packed the courtroom after demonstrating outside the Royal Courts of Justice.

Six of Brent's 12 libraries are facing closure - Kensal Rise, Barham Park, Preston Road and those at Neasden, Cricklewood and Tokyngton.

Ms Mountfield told the judge that all were treasured by the local community.

There had been some 330,000 visits to them in 2010-2011 and they had almost 12,000 'active users'.

Brent council is arguing that the decision of its executive on April 11 to order the closures was not tainted by legal error.

Council
lawyers say in court documents the decision was 'rational, made with 
great care and was based on a full appreciation of the obligation to act
within the law'.

Due regard was had to the 2010 Equality Act, and a careful equality impact assessment was carried out.

Brent
borough's population of about 290,000 is the second ethnically most 
diverse in the country, with 130 languages spoken in the borough's 
schools.

Outside court, novelist Maggie Gee was among dozens of campaigners protesting against the closures.

She said libraries were needed more than ever in times of recession.

'Libraries
are where the unemployed to go find out information about work, 
libraries are where people who've just come into the country find 
information, libraries are needed more than ever when times are hard,' 
said Gee, who lives near Kensal Rise library.

She
asked: 'Where do teenagers go to study if they can't find peace and 
quiet at home? Where do they find information if they don't have 
computers? They go to libraries.

'I
wrote two novels, Grace and Light Years, in the British Library. People
need libraries. A lot of people making these decisions about closures 
probably owe a lot to libraries themselves.

'They should be looking at cuts in management costs not closing libraries and front-line library staff.'

A spokesman for the Brent SOS Libraries campaign added: 'This decision has been taken despite massive opposition by residents who want to see those libraries remain open as a valuable resource for the whole community.'

Margaret Bailey, one of the campaigners bringing the judicial review claim, said: 'The threatened libraries are important for everyone who lives, studies or works locally, but especially for low income families and their children.'

She said the proposed cuts, ordered by the council's executive committee in April, 'make no sense legally or otherwise'.

John Halford, of Bindmans LLP, the solicitors representing the campaigners, said: 'Brent sought to characterise its proposals as a "transformation" of library services.

'But in reality it has simply swung a wrecking ball through local services with little regard to the consequences for those who use them.'

The Government has faced criticism from the author Kate Mosse over its refusal to intervene in library closures around the country.

She said there had been 'a catastrophic failure of leadership' from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, the Arts Council and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).

A DCMS spokesman said: 'We continue to monitor and assess proposals and decisions being made about changes to library services across England.

'We take very seriously compliance by local authorities with their statutory duty to understand the local needs for library services and to provide a comprehensive and efficient service to match that need.'
