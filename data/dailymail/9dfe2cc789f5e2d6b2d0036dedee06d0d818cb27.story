Martin Whitmarsh’s position at the head of McLaren Formula One team has been usurped by Ron Dennis, the marque’s legendary former team principal, in a coup d’etat.

It was announced on Thursday that Dennis has taken over as group chief executive – the most senior position Whitmarsh held, in addition to his title of team principal.

Dennis will conduct a root-and-branch investigation into the team’s failure to finish on the podium last season.

Former glory: Ron Dennis, returning as McLaren Group CEO, oversaw Lewis Hamilton's title triumph in 2008

End of the road: Martin Whitmarsh, here with Jenson Button and Sergio Perez, is facing the axe

Sportsmail understands that 
Dennis’s decision on who will be team principal for the 2014 season will
 be announced next month ahead of the first race in Australia on March 
16. It is probable that Whitmarsh will be replaced, possibly moving 
sideways within the business.

In
 what may have spelt out Whitmarsh’s fate, Dennis told the team at their
 Woking headquarters in Thursday that ‘there will be changes’ and that 
‘we will win again’. His 20-minute speech was met with prolonged 
applause.

Perhaps tellingly, Whitmarsh was not in attendance, unlike other senior staff.

It
 is not thought Dennis will take over as team principal himself, given 
that he has a wider brief not only as chief executive now but in 
remaining as chairman of McLaren Automotive.

Ross Brawn, who left Mercedes in November, is among the leading contenders having spoken to Dennis – a one-time adversary – at a shoot at the end of last year. There now appears no personal animus between the two giants of the sport to prevent such a move.

Time's up: Whitmarsh's future as team principal appears untenable following the return of Dennis

Centre of attention: Dennis is back in the spotlight

'My
 fellow shareholders have mandated me to write an exciting new chapter 
in the story of McLaren, beginning by improving our on-track and 
off-track performance, said Dennis.

'Over
 the coming weeks I intend to undertake a thorough and objective review 
of each of our businesses with the intention of optimising every aspect 
of our existing operations, whilst identifying new areas of growth that 
capitalise on our technologies, and where appropriate further investing 
in them.

'During
 February, I will articulate a new Group strategy and implement the 
organisational structure best suited to achieving it. I am excited by 
the prospect of returning to the role of group chief executive officer 
and working with my many colleagues and fellow shareholders to fulfil 
our objective – which is to win at whatever we do.'

Dennis, 66, has long wished to shake-up the Formula One side
of the business but met objection within the board.

They were, at times, keen
instead to restrain Dennis, whom they blamed for the failure of the road car
side of the business. Those problems have since been rectified and his position
is secure.

It is understood that he board’s composition remains
unchanged.
