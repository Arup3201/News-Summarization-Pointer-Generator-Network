Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm?

Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm?

Now share your opinion

Luis Suarez has had his eyes on Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder for quite some time it seems, with the 27-year-old appearing to attempt to bite the defender for the first time at the Confederations Cup 12 months ago!

The two sides met during the third-place play-off during the World Cup warm-up tournament and, after the incident on Tuesday, it appears Suarez has been biding his time and waiting for the opportunity to strike again.

Italy won that game on penalties after finishing 2-2 at the end of extra time, but Uruguay got their revenge this time round, beating them 1-0 through a Diego Godin header and knocking them out of the World Cup. But the biggest talking point, of course, was Suarez.

In Natal on Tuesday, with
 just 12 minutes to go and the scores locked at 0-0, Suarez and 
Chiellini fell to the floor in the penalty area.

Chiellini seemed 
absolutely incensed and replays soon showed why as Suarez was shown 
apparently attempting to dig his teeth in his opponents’ shoulder.

Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez failed to spot the incident but in a statement on their official website, FIFA confirmed that it will investigate the 27-year-old's actions in Natal. The maximum time FIFA are able to ban a player for is two years.

Uruguay and Suarez have until 5pm local time (9pm BST) on Wednesday to provide evidence. He could be face a lengthy ban that would keep him out of the last-16 match against Colombia and beyond should Uruguay progress.

FIFA's statement said: 'FIFA can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the player Luis Suarez of Uruguay following an apparent breach of article 48 and/or article 57 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code during the World Cup match Italy-Uruguay played on 24 June 2014.

'The player and/or the Uruguayan FA are invited to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant until 25 June 2014, 5pm, Brasilia time.'According to article 77 lit. a of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC), the FIFA Disciplinary Committee is responsible for sanctioning serious infringements which have escaped the match officials’ attention.

'Furthermore, according to article 96 of the FDC, any type of proof may be produced (par. 1), in particular are admissible, reports from referees, declarations from the parties and witnesses, material evidence, audio or video recordings (par. 3).'

FIFA's 
disciplinary code sets a maximum ban of 24 matches or two years, but the
 longest ban in World Cup history was eight games for Italy's Mauro 
Tassotti for breaking Spain's Luis Enrique's nose in 1994 with an elbow.
 Zinedine Zidane was given a three-match ban for headbutting Marco 
Materazzi in the 2006 final.

Jim Boyce, Britain's FIFA vice-president and head of FIFA's referees committee, expressed concerns about Suarez's actions.

He
 said: 'I have watched the incident several times on television. There 
is no doubt Luis Suarez is a fantastic footballer but, once again, his 
actions have left him open to severe criticism.

'FIFA must investigate the incident seriously and take whatever disciplinary action deemed necessary.'

Senior
 FIFA official Michel D'Hooghe told BBC Radio 5 Live that the 'serious' 
case should be brought to a hearing in front of its disciplinary 
commission and that 'biting is not compatible with normal football 
practice.'

Incredibly, it is the third time that Suarez is set to face disciplinary action for an incident involving biting an opponent.

He
 received a 10-game ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic 
in April 2013. After that incident he tweeted: 'I'm sad for what 
happened this afternoon, I apologize Ivanovic and all football world for
 my inexcusable behaviour. I'm so sorry about it!!'

Those
 words now seem even more hollow, especially as it was the second time 
he had failed to learn from his mistakes after previously receiving a 
seven-game ban for biting PSV's Ottman Bakkal while playing for Ajax in 
November 2010.
