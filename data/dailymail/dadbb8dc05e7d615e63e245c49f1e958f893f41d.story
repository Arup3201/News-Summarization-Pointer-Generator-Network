This is the uncanny moment a cloud formed over the Welsh countryside in the shape of groundbreaking passenger jet Concorde.

Roy Peckham, 66, spotted the plane-shaped cloud as it moved through the evening sky.

He said he couldn't believe his eyes as the clouds kept their shape long enough for him to photograph the phenomenon.

Mr Peckham, who lives in Pontypridd, South Wales said the cloud was coming from the direction of the Brecon Beacons.

He said: 'I saw the cloud and as it approached it became more and more defined.

'It looked like Concorde was flying across the countryside and about to land in Pontypridd.

Mr Peckham captured the 'once in a lifetime' moment from his home. He said: 'It looked like Concorde was flying across the countryside and about to land in Pontypridd'

'It was brilliant, a once in a lifetime photograph.'

Mr
Peckham, who runs a pony sanctuary, said: 'My son worked for British 
Airways as an engineer so I've always had an interest in aeroplanes.

'I
would have loved to have flown on Concorde, it is something we should 
be proud of and it is a shame it's no longer in service.'

Concorde,
which entered service in 1976, was the first supersonic passenger plane
and was capable of cruising at more than 1,300mph.

It took to the skies for the last time on October 24 2003, after being officially retired from commercial service.

The last of the three-strong fleet landed at Bristol's Filton Airfield, where the supersonic jet was built in the 1960s.

Just above the horizon, the dark blue jet-shaped cloud can be seen. Mr Peckham said it moved through the sky in perfect alignment

Concorde was introduced in 1969 and had its last flight in 2003. The commercial turbojet was considered a feat of aviation technology
