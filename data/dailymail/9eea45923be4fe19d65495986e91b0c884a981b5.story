The father of a girl who plunged 90ft to her death from a tower block window after a fight with her ex-boyfriend has launched a court battle to have her accidental death inquest verdict overturned.

An inquest into 17-year-old Emily Mather's death ruled that she pushed open the bedroom window of a ninth-floor flat  and accidentally fell head-first through it, shortly after an argument with her ex-boyfriend who was in the next room.

But her father, Malcolm, believes the full facts surrounding her death are yet to emerge and has taken the case to the High Court.

Miss Mather, who lived in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, with her father and sister Beth had been out with her friend Laurie Coxon, now 25, in June 2006.

They decided to contact Laurie's then boyfriend David Metcalf to ask if they could stop by at his flat in Eslington Court.

Miss Mather's ex-boyfriend Michael Boslem was also at the home and she was worried there was going to be 'some trouble' because of their recent break-up.

An argument between Mr Boslem and Miss Mather, who had recently had an abortion, broke out at the flat, the inquest in October this year heard.

The 17-year-old then went into the bedroom where she was left alone.

South Tyneside coroner Terence Carney ruled that Miss Mather, who had been drinking, stood on the bed to  push open the window but accidentally fell out as she did so.

However, Mr Mather, 48, claims there is no evidence to suggest his daughter touched the window.

He said: 'I don't think she could have been standing on the bed, opened the window and fallen out.

'There were no fingerprints or other evidence on that window.'

Yesterday Mr Mather began his fight at the High Court to overturn the inquest's accidental death verdict.

'It's been hard work but the whole family are determined to continue the process,' he said.

'It's up to the High Court to grant the judicial review but of course we want a positive outcome and we want to get the inquest verdict overturned.' 

After the hearing last month, solicitor Sefton Kwasnik, speaking on behalf of the family, hit out at the coroner's verdict.

He said: 'It's astounding to say that Emily opened that window when there is no physical evidence that details this having taken place.

'For the coroner to say that this was an accident caused by Emily's actions is mystifying.'

Miss Mather, an award-winning sixth-form student, was studying for her A-levels at the time of her death and wanted to work with children.

Her father last saw her on the night she died when he gave her some pocket money.  

The following morning two police officers arrived at his home deliver the tragic news that his daughter was dead.

A post-mortem examination revealed Emily died of a spinal cord injury due to a fracture to the cervical spine and a fall from a height.

Investigations revealed that Emily had alcohol, pholcodine, which was identified as a cough medicine, and traces of cocaine in her system.

The restraining arm on the bedroom window was detached and damaged.
