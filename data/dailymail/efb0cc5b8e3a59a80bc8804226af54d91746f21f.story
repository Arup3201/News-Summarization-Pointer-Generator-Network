The Labour party is at loggerheads with the White House after Barack Obama heaped praise on his 'great friend' David Cameron in an extraordinary pre-election endorsement.

Harriet Harman today declared that the US President was 'wrong' to praise the Tory economic strategy for ensuring Britain 'stands out' on the world stage.

Privately senior Labour figures are dismayed at the backing from the US, especially after Ed Miliband hired a senior Obama aide to advise his election campaign.

US President Barack Obama today handed David Cameron an extraordinary pre-election endorsement, hailing the British Prime Minister as a 'great friend' 

Images of Mr Cameron with the US President, who is more popular in the UK than in America, have delighted Tory strategists.

The personal support from a Democrat President for a Conservative has caused dismay for Labour, who hoped a visit to Washington last year had bolstered his image as a potential statesman.

Mr Miliband is also under pressure for paying a huge salary to David Axelrod, a former Obama election campaign guru.

Many in the Labour party had hoped the appointment would help to secure support from the White House.

'I'm not quite sure why we're paying Axelrod £300,000,' one Labour frontbencher told the Sunday Times. 'We should ask for our money back.'

Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted the US President was 'wrong' to suggest the British economy was on the right track

The Obama endorsement of Mr Cameron came after it emerged the US President refers to the Prime Minister privately as his 'bro'.

At a press conference on Friday, the President 'Let me put this speculation to rest: put simply, David is a great friend. He is one of my closest and most trusted partners in the world.

'On many of the challenges we face... we see the world the same way.

'Great Britain is our indispensable partner - and David personally an outstanding partner.'

Suggesting Britain should stick to its current economic course, President Obama declared: 'On the economy, I would note that Great Britain and the US are two economies that are standing out at a time when a lot of other countries are having problems.

'So we must be doing something right.'

The glowing tribute came during a press conference in the White House after a two-day visit to Washington

Labour leader Ed Miliband had hoped that a visit to the White House last year, and a meeting with President Obama, would help to prevent a ringing endorsement for Mr Cameron ahead of the election

Labour irritation at the remarks spilled into the public today, when Ms Harman, the party's deputy leader, insisted the US President was wrong.

'He's wrong in that he's not reflecting the fact that, although the economy is back in growth, that growth is not being felt by people and it's a recovery that is being accompanied by a stagnation in living standards,' she told BBC One's Andrew Marr show.

'And that's why we are saying that people are no better off, the recovery hasn't reached their front door and the economy is not working for everyday people – it's just working for a few people at the top.

'And I'm sure President Obama, if he heard me say that, would agree with me.'

Ms Harman also questioned Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, who last week said the UK was setting an example to the rest of the world.

Labour's deputy leader said the IMF had failed to address the question of living standards.

'Ed Miliband is absolutely right that although there is a recovery, it is not helping ordinary everyday people whose living standards are stagnating. And he's right to say the deficit has not been brought down by the Tories.'

A spokesman for Miliband said: 'Barack Obama met Ed, which is not something he normally does with a leader of the opposition. I don't think the White House is endorsing any political party in this election and nor should they be.'
