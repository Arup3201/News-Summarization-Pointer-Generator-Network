The newly-announced Pope Francis is the first leader of the Catholic Church to hail from Latin America and his selection is being hailed as a triumph throughout the United States.

President Barack Obama offered warm wishes to new Pope on Wednesday and said the choice of the Cardinal from Argentina to ascend to the papacy speaks to the vitality of increasingly important Latin America.

Obama called the new pope 'a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us.'

'As the first pope from the Americas, his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day,' Obama said in a statement.

Celebration: Faithful followers in St Peter's Square celebrated the historic pick. Though Pope Francis I hails from Argentina, he knows both Italian and German as well as Spanish

The new Pope's work in his native Argentina- where he is known as an austere Jesuit intellectual who modernized the country's conservative Catholic church- says a good deal about the future direction of the Church, as it is a clear signal of good faith towards heavily-Catholic Latin and South America.

Represent: Catholics make up more than a fifth of the United States population

‘For us to go into the Americas for 
the very first time, and South America, is awesome,’ said church 
assistant Catherine Sims who works at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in 
Libertyville, Illinois.

‘When he picks a name like that, it 
tells you a lot about who he wants to emulate. Christ revealed himself 
to St. Francis and said rebuild my church. If he’s taken a name like 
that, and he’s from South America, we’re probably going in a new 
direction with new leadership in the Vatican,’ she told The Chicago Tribune.

The United States has a significant Catholic population, with Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate reporting that there were 66.3million Catholics in the country in 2012.

That figure, originally reported by the Church itself, means that the faithful make up 21 per cent of the country's growing population of 313million.

In New York, Monsignor Robert Ritchie of St. Patrick’s Cathedral seemed hopeful in an address to congregants.

‘I know God has chosen a holy father who will do exactly as he was told to do -- feed his sheep,’ he said on Wednesday.

The decision is a landmark one for the traditionally Catholic countries of South America.

'For
the churches that are pilgrims in Latin America, it is the cause of 
great joy,' said a statement from the Catholic bishops of Mexico.

'For the Mexican church, it is a clear sign of love for the churches that are pilgrims in these lands.'

Grasping the news: Schoolchildren at St Paul Catholic School in Valpariso, Indiana watched as the smoke turned from black to white. People from both South and North America are thrilled about selection from the Western hemisphere

Groups of supporters waved Argentine 
flags in St. Peter's Square as Francis, wearing simple white robes, made
his first public appearance as pope.

'Ladies
and Gentlemen, good evening,' he said before making a reference to his 
roots in Latin America, which accounts for about 40 per cent of the 
world's Roman Catholics.

Cars
honked their horns as the news spread and television announcers 
screamed with elation and surprise and Catholics began flooding toward 
the cathedral, where Ana Maria Perez and a few dozen other women had 
been waiting for the announcement.

‘He
is going to be the pope of the street,’ she said, referring to 
Bergoglio's habit of taking the subways alongside working class 
Argentines.

Historic: Shelly Guadelupe was visiting New York City from Puerto Rico when the news was announced. Many followers are excited about the pick because he is the first Jesuit to be selected, and made his name by giving back to the needy

His people: The new Pope looked out at his following from the balcony of St Peter's Basilica

Known until Wednesday as Jorge 
Bergoglio, the 76-year-old is said to be a humble man who denied himself 
the luxuries that previous Buenos Aires cardinals enjoyed.

Church-watchers are reading that as a
sign that the upper-echelon of Catholics understand that their global 
image may need to be reworked in light of recent scandals- like the 
widespread sex abuse cases throughout the United States, for example- 
and need to focus on doing good.

There was excitement as well elsewhere.

Bergoglio
often rode the bus to work, cooked his own meals and regularly visited 
the slums that ring Argentina's capital. He considers social outreach, 
rather than doctrinal battles, to be the essential business of the 
church.

In Panama City, public relations executive Nelsa Aponte said with teary eyes, ‘This made me cry, I had to get out my handkerchief.’

‘We have a new pastor, and for the first time, he is from Latin America.’

Armando Connell, 54, a doorman at a luxury hotel in Panama City, expressed hope that ‘the new pope will be closer to us, and will show more concern about the poverty many of us suffer.’

In Mexico City, pediatrician Victor De la Rosa, 64, said the decision ‘is going to allow Latin America to be more involved in the church's decisions, above all in modernizing the church.’

American politicians were quick with their congratulations, many of them taking to Twitter to announce their praise in 140 characters.

Demographics: As the former Governor of Hispanic-heavy Florida, Jeb Bush brought up Pope Francis' Argentinean upbringing in his Twitter post

All faiths: The goodwill was not limited to Catholics as Jewish Senator Chuck Schumer shared his congratulations

Former Florida Governor, and possible 
Republican presidential nominee, Jeb Bush made a point of bringing up 
the historic geographic implications of the pick. Having served two 
terms in a heavily-Hispanic state, it comes as little surprise that he 
paid homage to the big day for his former constituents.

‘Wonderful news of the selection of Pope Francis, the first Latin American pope,’ Mr Bush said.

Religious
affiliations did not stop the spread of good will, as Catholics like 
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Congressman Sean Duffy were 
joined by Jewish Congressman Eric Cantor and Senator Chuck Schumer in 
wishing the new Bishop of Rome good luck.

‘Overjoyed
for Catholics everywhere and hopeful that Pope Francis will help foster
peace and spirituality across the globe,’ Mr Schumer said.
