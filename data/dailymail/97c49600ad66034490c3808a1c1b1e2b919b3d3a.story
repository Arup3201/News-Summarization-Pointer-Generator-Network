Two upstate New York radio hosts have been fired over their on-air comments about the city of Rochester's decision to cover gender reassignment surgery for city employees.

Entercom Rochester on Thursday announced the firings of Kimberly Ray and Barry Beck from WBZA, calling their comments 'hateful' and saying they don't represent the station.

Buzz off: Barry Beck and Kimberley Ray have been fired as hosts of The Breakfast Buzz morning show for their remarks regarding transgender people

'The services that will be paid for under the new coverage: gender reassignment surgery, psychological counseling, because you're probably a nut job to begin with,' Ray said on Wednesday morning's show.

The two also played the Aerosmith song
 'Dude Looks Like a Lady' and likened gender non-conforming issues to a 
woman who wants a 'boob job' for her mental health, and mocked a female 
listener who called to complain, saying, 'Thank you, sir.'

The discussion on their Breakfast Buzz show Wednesday had generated 4,500 signatures by Friday on a removal petition.

Phone numbers for the two were unlisted and they couldn't be reached for comment Thursday.

The pair were initially suspended, but one day later the station took the decision to fire them, effective immediately.

'Their
 hateful comments against the transgender community do not represent our
 station or our company,' The Buzz said in a statement Thursday morning.

'We deeply apologize to the transgender community, the community of Rochester and anyone else who was offended by their comments. We are proud of our past work on behalf of the local LGBT community and we remain committed to that partnership.'

Digging a deeper hole, Ray took to Twitter to defend herself, posting 'Freedom of Speech includes the freedom to offend others. You aren't granted a right to not be offended in this life #getoverit#ROC,' on a now-defunct Twitter account.

A Facebook post for 98.9 The Buzz yesterday announcing the pair's dismissal garnered 2,178 likes.

'The 1st amendment protects you from the government. It does not guarantee you the right to speak without consequences from your employer,' commented a listener on the post.

Beginning January 1, Rochester will cover surgeries and counseling related to gender reassignment.

The city of Rochester made the benefits announcements last weekend.
