Brazilian superstar Neymar made sure he enjoyed a white Christmas by dying his beard for the festive season.

The Barcelona forward showed off his new look when he played in a charity match in Brazil on Boxing Day.

And his beard wasn't the only thing catching the eye, as Neymar also comically drove a cart around the pitch... to tend to the 'injured' Robinho.

The former Manchester City winger faked the injury to provoke the action, as the Barca star took to a new technique during the game. 

It was his second charity match in four days after he captained a side of his friends against a side of Brazilian star Nene's friends in a charity match 'Ball Hunger Only' in Jundai, Sao Paulo on Monday - where he stole the show with an individual piece of skill that simply took the breath away.

The game had only been playing five minutes when the 22-year-old collected a shot that had rebounded off the post before 'rainbow flicking' the ball over a bemused defender's header, performing a little pirouette and bursting through to chip the keeper. 

And just to show that blondes do indeed have more fun, Neymar joined some friends for a seasonal sing-song and posted the video on Instagram.
