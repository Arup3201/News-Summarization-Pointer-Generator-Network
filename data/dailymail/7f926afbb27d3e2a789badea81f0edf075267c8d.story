Convicted: Former school teacher Aaron Ledean, is facing imprisonment after being found guilty at Teesside Crown Court of repeated sexual assaults on an underage boy

A former school teacher is facing jail after carrying out repeated sexual assaults on an underage boy. 

A jury unanimously convicted Aaron Ledean of three indecent assaults on the teenage boy in the 1990s.

The ex-science teacher already had convictions for downloading almost 4,000 child abuse images. 

Jurors heard how the victim of the 
assaults - who cannot be named for legal reasons, now an adult - felt 
'euphoria' as he developed a strong crush on the affable, well-liked and
openly gay Ledean.     

He said it was a difficult time in his life as they flirted with one another.

They
went to bars in their 'first date' in Middlesbrough and engaged in 
sexual activity in a visit to the cinema and two pre-arranged visits to 
Ledean’s home.

The boy was 'devastated' when Ledean later broke things off.       

Years later, the boy confronted 
Ledean and said it was inappropriate for him to be in a position of 
responsibility towards children.

Ledean
became a teacher at a Teesside school for several years. The 
complainant said the events preyed on his mind over the years and he 
grew to believe what had happened was wrong.         

He
underwent counselling and reported matters to police in 2010. Ledean 
said none of the alleged sexual activity or flirtation took place. 

He said he felt affection but not sexual attraction for the boy and insisted they were just mates.

He said he deeply regretted rejecting the boy, after the teenager unexpectedly turned up at his home with a bunch of roses.  

Ledean, 40, had denied the three charges of indecent assault in a trial at Teesside Crown Court.

But prosecutor Shaun Dodds alleged that Ledean showed he had a sexual interest in young boys.         

Judge
John Walford said the alleged sexual activity was consensual, but it 
constituted indecent assault because of the boy’s age at the time.   

Jurors were told of Ledean’s previous convictions. He was given a suspended prison sentence after he admitted 16 charges of making and one of possessing indecent photographs of children in 2008.

He had 3,925 images of children on a laptop and discs. Ledean said he was addicted to pornography at the time of downloading the pictures in 2005 to 2007, but there was 'a world of difference' between thinking and doing things.                                                 

He told the court he’d been through therapy and counselling and was not attracted to children.      

Judge Walford told Ledean, of Crook, County Durham, that prison was inevitable, remanding him in custody until March 18.
