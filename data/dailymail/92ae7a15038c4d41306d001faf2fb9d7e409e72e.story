An 89-year-old Philadelphia man was ordered held without bail today on a German arrest warrant charging that he aided and abetted in the deaths of 216,000 Jews while he was a guard at the Auschwitz death camp.

U.S. authorities arrested retired toolmaker Johann 'Hans' Breyer on Tuesday. He spent the night in custody and appeared frail during a detention hearing in federal court, where he wore an 
olive green prison jumpsuit and carrying a cane.

Legal
 filings unsealed today indicate that the district court in 
Weiden, Germany, issued a warrant for Breyer's arrest the day before, 
charging him with 158 counts of complicity in the commission of murder.

Each
 count represents a trainload of Nazi prisoners from Hungary, Germany 
and Czechoslovakia who were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau between May 
1944 and October 1944, the documents said.

Breyer was born in 1925 in what was then 
Czechoslovakia to an ethnic German father and an American mother, 
Katharina, who was born in Philadelphia. Slovakia became a separate 
state in 1939 under the influence of Nazi Germany.

In 1942, the Waffen
 SS embarked on a drive to recruit ethnic Germans there and Breyer 
joined at age 17. The fact he was a minor at the time was critical in 
the 2003 decision to allow him to stay in the United States.

In
 1951, American military authorities in Germany carried out a background
 check on Breyer when he first applied for a visa to the U.S.

The file from that investigation lists 
him as being with a SS Totenkopf, or 'Death's Head', battalion in 
Auschwitz as late as Dec. 29, 1944, four months after he said he 
deserted.

Breyer has admitted
 he was a guard at Auschwitz in occupied Poland during World War II, but
 has told The Associated Press he was stationed outside of the 
Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp part of the complex and had nothing to do 
with the wholesale slaughter of about 1.5 million Jews and others behind
 the gates.

In a 2012 AP interview at his 
modest row house in northeastern Philadelphia, Breyer acknowledged  that
 he was in the Waffen SS at Auschwitz but that he never served at the 
part of the camp responsible for the extermination of Jews. During the interview, Breyer said he had recently suffered three 'mini-strokes', but he was cogent and clear as he talked about his past for more than an hour.

'I
 didn't kill anybody, I didn't rape anybody, and I don't even have a 
traffic ticket here,' he said. 'I didn't do anything wrong.'

He
 said he was aware of what was going on inside the death camp, but did 
not witness it himself. 'We could only see the outside, the gates,' he 
said.

Following his arrest, Breyer's attorney
 Dennis Boyle argued his client is now too infirm to be detained pending a 
hearing on his possible extradition to Germany.

Breyer has mild dementia
 and heart issues and has previously suffered strokes, Boyle said.

'Mr. Breyer is not a threat to anyone,' said Boyle. 'He's not a flight risk.'

But 
Magistrate Judge Timothy Rice ruled the detention center was equipped to
 care for Breyer, who appeared to comprehend questions about the nature 
of the hearing.

A law enforcement officer also 
testified Breyer and his elderly wife grasped what was happening during 
his arrest on Tuesday outside their home in northeast Philadelphia.

'They both understood,' deputy marshal Daniel Donnelly said. 'It wasn't news to them.'

Breyer has been under investigation by prosecutors in the Bavarian town of Weiden, near where he last lived in Germany.

The Army Investigative Records Repository file, obtained by the AP from the National Archives through a Freedom of Information Act request, is significant because judges in 2003 said Breyer's testimony on desertion was part of what convinced them that his service with the Waffen SS after turning 18 might not have been voluntary, further mitigating his wartime responsibility.

Breyer testified in U.S. court that he served as a perimeter guard at Auschwitz I, which was largely for prisoners used as slave laborers, though it also had a makeshift gas chamber used early in the war; it was also the camp where SS doctor Josef Mengele carried out sadistic experiments on inmates.

But he denied ever serving in Auschwitz II, better known as Auschwitz-Birkenau, the death camp area where the bulk of the people were killed.

He also said he deserted in August, 1944 and never returned to the camp, though eventually rejoined his unit fighting outside Berlin in the final weeks of the war.

Also weighing in Breyer's favor with the judges was his testimony that he refused to have the SS tattoo; he does not have such a mark today or evidence that one was removed.

Thomas Walther, a former federal prosecutor with the specia loffice that investigates Nazi war crimes in Germany, now represents family members of some of Breyer's alleged victims as co-plaintiffs in the case. He called for a speedy extradition.

'The German court has to find late justice for the crimes of Breyer and for the victims and their sons and daughters as co-plaintiffs,' Walther wrote in an email to the AP. 'It is late, but not too late.'

Prosecutors in Weiden could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. Their investigation comes after years of failed U.S. efforts to have Breyer stripped of his American citizenship and deported.

A court ruling in 2003 allowed him to stay in the United States, mainly on the grounds that he had joined the SS as a minor and could therefore not be held legally responsible for participation in it.

His American citizenship stems from the fact his mother was born in the U.S.; she later moved to Europe, where Breyer was born.

During
 Breyer's arrest on Tuesday, he asked the marshals to retrieve papers in 
his home that document his right to stay in the U.S., Donnelly 
testified.

Breyer's wife and two grandsons 
attended the hour-long hearing in Philadelphia. His 
extradition hearing was scheduled for August 21.

Efraim
 Zuroff, the head Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in 
Jerusalem, said he hoped there would be no obstacles to Breyer's 
extradition and trial overseas.

'Germany 
deserves credit for doing this - for extending and expanding their 
efforts and, in a sense, making a final attempt to maximize the 
prosecution of Holocaust perpetrators,' he said in a telephone interview
 from Jerusalem.

Experts estimated in 2012 that at least 80 former camp guards or others who would fall into the same category are likely still alive today, almost 70 years after the end of the war.

By treaty, the U.S. can extradite its citizens to Germany. But Breyer said in 2012 that he would fight any attempts to take him away from the U.S. and his wife and family.

'I'm an American citizen, just as if I had been born here,' he said at the time. 'They can't deport me.'
