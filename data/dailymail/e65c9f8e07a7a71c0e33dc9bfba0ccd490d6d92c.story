Belita Howell, 58, found guilty of neglecting a pensioner with dementia and ¿orchestrating¿ a cover-up

A care home boss has been sentenced after being found guilty of neglecting a pensioner with dementia.

Belita Howell, 58, former manager of Mother Redcaps care home in Birkenhead, Merseyside, received a 12 month suspended sentence, after a patient died after falling out of his faulty bed.

Walter Witcherley, 86, suffered a broken hip and died in hospital a month later, as Howell tried to orchestrate a 'cover up'.

Liverpool Crown Court heard how Howell was warned prior to the fall by a member of staff that the brakes on Mr Witcherley’s bed were faulty.

The pensioner had previously been assessed as having a high risk of falling after spending a month in hospital after a similar incident.

The court was also told how Howell, whose sentence was suspended for two years, was responsible for the pensioner’s welfare but did nothing to ensure his bed was fit for purpose.

After discovering that Mr Witcherley was in hospital, Andrew Ford, prosecuting, said the former care home manager tried to cover up the incident.

The court heard that Howell instructed that a log in the maintenance book, that said the bed needed to be repaired, should be marked off, to give the appearance that work had been completed.

Andrew Ford, prosecuting, said: 'As manager of Mother Redcaps, she had a responsibility to care for Mr Witcherley.

'She had failed to maintain a proper bed for him and following that effectively covered it up in the aftermath of the fall Mr Witcherley suffered, where he sustained fracture injuries.

'There was a complete absence of a rail and sufficient brakes on the bed and he was not the same again after the fall.'

Charles Lander, defending, commented: 'There were problems in the nursing home that pre-dated the defendant’s employment.

'She has worked hard all her life and her loss of income means her house is now up for sale.'

Judge Andrew Hatton said: 'Your appearance before this court is a real tragedy.

'You are a 58 year-old woman who has worked hard all her life.

'There is no evidence that the injury sustained by Mr Witcherley was the cause of or precipitated his death.

'But it is clear to me that his final few weeks were made considerably more difficult than the weeks preceding the injury.

'He was left bed-bound as a result of your neglect.

'Walter Witcherley was at the time an 86 year-old man who suffered from advanced dementia and as the manager you were responsible for his care.

'He presented a significant risk of falling and it was essential that his treatment in the home included a bed with adequate rails and sturdy brakes. This was tragically not the case and he died of his injuries a few weeks later.'
