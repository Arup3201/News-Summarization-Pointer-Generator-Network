Team news

Burnley

Burnley midfielder Dean Marney remains a doubt for his side's Barclays Premier League clash with Everton at Turf Moor on Sunday.

Marney has missed the last three games with a hamstring injury and will be given a late test by the club's medical staff.

Steven Reid and Michael Keane are pushing for recalls after groin and hamstring problems respectively, but Matthew Taylor remains absent as he awaits an Achilles operation.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Lafferty, Ward, Duff, Shackell, Mee, Wallace, Kightly, Cisak, Sordell, Marney, Jutkiewicz, Boyd, Gilks, Keane, Long, Barnes, Arfield, Ings, Chalobah, Jones.

Everton

James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman, Steven Naismith and Leon Osman could all return to the Everton side for their Barclays Premier League clash with Burnley on Sunday.

Naismith and Osman were left out of the travelling party for Thursday's Europa League trip to face Lille while Coleman was an unused substitute and McCarthy played only the last few minutes.

The Toffees have no new injury worries but Kevin Mirallas (hamstring) and John Stones (ankle) remain sidelined while Bryan Oviedo and Arouna Kona are still not match-fit.

Provisional squad: Howard, Robles, Coleman, Baines, Hibbert, Browning, Jagielka, Distin, Alcaraz, Gibson, McCarthy, Barry, Besic, Barkley, Osman, Pienaar, Atsu, McGeady, Lukaku, Eto'o, Naismith.

Everton (along with Chelsea and Hull) are one of only three teams to score in every Premier League game this season.

No player has been booked for dissent more times than Tim Howard (2) in the Premier League this season.

Romelu Lukaku has now scored 18 Premier League goals for Everton, one more than he notched in a single season at West Brom.

Danny Ings has mustered just one shot on target in five appearances in the Premier League.

Leighton Baines now has 42 Premier League assists. The only defender with more in Premier League history is Graeme Le Saux with 44 (and he often played as a midfielder).
