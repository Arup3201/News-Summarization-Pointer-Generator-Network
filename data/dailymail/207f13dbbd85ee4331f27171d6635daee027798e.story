This is the shocking moment a drunk Russian driver ploughs into pedestrians on a zebra crossing scattering them like skittles in a bowling alley.

But another driver, whose car was fitted with a dashboard camera, helped capture the hit-and-run driver, who, after slowing down for a second, suddenly put his foot down and sped away.

The shocking footage which was taken in the city of Volgograd in southern Russia shows the three victims, a 23-year-old young woman and 23-year-old man as well as a 51-year-old woman walking across the zebra crossing.

Other traffic was stopped but the car driven by the 40-year-old local man Gegham Mkhitaryan decides to overtake the stopped vehicles, and as it crosses back onto the road in front of the queue ploughs into the three people on the zebra crossing.

For a second they are seen frozen in the headlights before the car hits them like skittles and sends them flying through the air.

With bodies in the road, the driver decides to speed off - but is later caught by police

The young woman who was battered to one side manages to scramble to her feet and staggers to the side of the road, but the other two are left lying lifeless at the intersection of Raboche-Krestyanskoyand Street and Profsoyuznoy Street.

The hit-and-run driver meanwhile initially seems to slow down but after seeing one of the bodies lying in front of the car, hits the accelerator and speeds off.

The whole incident was captured by a fellow driver who had a dashboard camera

But the number plates of the SUV Ssangyong had been captured on the dashboard camera of the car at the zebra crossing and it was quickly handed to police that allowed them to identify, track down and arrest Mkhitaryan, who was found to be intoxicated.

He told police he had no idea how many people he had it and had fled because he was scared of being punished for drink-driving. 

Police said that the 51-year-old woman was in intensive care although the young man had been treated at hospital and also released along with the young woman.
