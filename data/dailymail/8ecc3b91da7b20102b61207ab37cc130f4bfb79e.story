Lee Philip Hammond has been told to expect a jail sentence for fraud, theft and attempted theft convictions

An accountant with a gambling addiction is facing a possible jail sentence after he stole £540,000 from investors and employers to feed his habit.

Despite being on police bail, 30-year-old Lee Philip Hammond continued to take money to gamble after defrauding money from different companies in Durham.

In total he took £539,343.10, the bulk of which came before a merger. Durham Crown Court heard that he stole £54,000 over 15 months between October 2008 and January 2010 from three investors to the accountancy firm he ran.

He then defrauded a further 
£411,305.60 from Shildon and Sedgefield Development Agency, an agency 
set up to help give free advice and guidance to new businesses.

Following a merger, he took a further £73,437.50 from the newly-formed South Durham Enterprise Agency seven months later.

Hammond was arrested and questioned on fraud charges but later bailed.

Despite being under investigation he then took £1,957.91 from Town and City Management Ltd by creating false invoices.

He tried to take a further £3,750 from the same company, but was unsuccessful.

Defending
him, Scott Smith said some of the money was made through the sale of 
accountancy software packages that did not exist and all the cash went 
on gambling.

Judge Christopher Prince warned him 
that he should expect a prison term saying: 'Go away and put your 
affairs in order before you come to court. You know when you return here
you must expect to receive a custodial sentence.'

Mr Smith continued:  'He is of previous good character, and he made a full confession, effectively handing himself in.

'We have obtained details of his 
gambling addiction and I think the court, in considering sentence, would
also be assisted by a pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation 
Service.

'Some of the fraud, certainly from the confusion beneath all this, appears to be from what is a very profitable little business.

'It involved shares in the company, a company which was, effectively, the defendant.

'Investors, effectively, got a share in the company but he stole from the company and he doesn't seek to challenge that.'

Hammond, from Darlington, admitted five counts of fraud, three of theft, and one of attempted theft at Durham Crown Court yesterday.

He will be sentenced on March 22 when he will hear statements from his victims and was released on bail.
