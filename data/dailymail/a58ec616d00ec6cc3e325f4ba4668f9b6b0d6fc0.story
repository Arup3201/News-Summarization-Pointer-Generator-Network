 

Education Minister Christopher Pyne has denied that he ever offered a job or legal representation to James Ashby, a former staff member of speaker Peter Slipper.

'Sometimes people misinterpret conversations that are made and that are held,' Mr Pyne said.

'I had three meetings with Mr Ashby, the first was when I met him in Peter Slipper's office very briefly.

'The second was when I shared a drink with him, and another staffer, while I was waiting for Peter Slipper to come back from the adjournment debate when he was the speaker ..and the third was when he came to collect a couple of bottles of wine,' Mr Pyne added.

To the question of whether a lawyer was offered to James Ashby (left), Christopher Pyrne (right) replied: 'That was not my intention, no.'

My Pyne added that 'I stand by all the statements I have made previously over the last 2 and a half years'.

James Ashby was a former staff member in the office of ex-Speaker of the House, Peter Slipper. He took legal action against Mr Slipper, including allegations of sexual harrassment.

Mr Ashby took Mr Slipper to court alleging sexual harassment and breach of contract. That case against the former Speaker was ultimately dropped 

In a 60 Minutes interview, James Ashby revealed all, telling of his sexual harrassment claims against his former boss and he also claimed to have told Mr Pyne of the problems he was facing.

'I had no specific knowledge about the allegations that Mr Ashby made against Mr Slipper before I read about them,' insisted the Education Minister.  

Mr Pyne said he knew that Mr Ashby was uncomfortable with his situation but did not know about the specific allegations.

When asked again if he or the Prime Minister were aware of the rumours surrounding Mr Slipper he said: 'Were we aware of rumours? Well everybody in Canberra in Parliament House were aware of rumours about Mr Slipper going back many years.' My Pyne also insisted he never discussed a possible job for James Ashby with the Prime Minister.

However, during the 60 Minutes interview, Mr Ashby said in his conversation with Christopher Pyne, that he had been offered the services of a lawyer and promised a job could always be found for him.

Mr Pyne denied those claims.

James Ashby claimed that he was warned by Mr Pyne that if he ever revealed their conversation he would be publicly labelled a 'pathological liar'.

'I had a brief meeting, we discussed the fact the Queensland state election was coming very soon, he indicated he was uncomfortable in Mr Slipper's office and I indicated to him that if we won the Queensland state election that would be a chance potentially for him to get out of Mr Slipper's office but the fact is there was no job ever provided for Mr Ashby,' Mr Pyne said.

'My intention was never to lead him to believe that a job would be provided to him but obviously if we won the Queensland state election and then subsequently the federal election, when you are in government there are a lot more jobs available than when you are in opposition and that if he felt uncomfortable in Mr Slipper's office, that would be an opportunity for him to get out of the office.'

Mr Ashby claimed that he was warned by Mr Pyne that if he ever revealed their conversation he would be publicly labelled a 'pathological liar'.

'I would not have used that language,' Mr Pyne countered. 

Shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said the Prime Minister needs to provide more information about how much he knew, along with his Education Minister.

'I think Mr Abbott needs to come clean about his own involvement in what he knew, and in particular Christopher Pyne has serious questions to answer,' Mr Dreyfus said.

Mr Pyne also added that 'I thought he was very courageous last night in telling his story - he came across as a very decent person who wants to put that unhappy period behind him.'

To the question of whether a lawyer was offered to Mr Ashby, Mr Pyrne replied: 'That was not my intention, no.'
