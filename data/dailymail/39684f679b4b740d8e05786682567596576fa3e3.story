It's bound to happen isn't it?

Tottenham's defeat against Besiktas here in the Ataturk Olympic Stadium saw Mauricio Pochettino's side relinquish top spot in Europa League Group C, meaning the Londoners could now face a much trickier last 32 clash.

Among the sides Spurs could draw are Zenit St Petersburg, who are managed by... Andre Villas-Boas.

Spurs find out on Monday who'll they'll face in the next round, but the prospect of their former manager returning to White Hart Lane will get the juices flowing until then.

It would be the Portuguese's first return to the club since his unceremonious sacking last December. He'll undoubtedly have something to prove.

Though, the return of Villas-Boas would have been the final thing on Pochettino's mind as he watched his side throw away top spot - and the prospect of an easier draw.

Besiktas were forced to put on two sound and light parties to keep supporters entertained during two floodlight failures.

Pochettino won't be in a party mood as he makes his way back to London, though.

The big team news was the return of Kyle Walker following a nine month lay-off due to a troublesome abdominal injury.

Spurs just needed a point to prevent Besiktas from leapfrogging them into top spot.

Pochettino was adamant ahead of kick-off that finishing top of their pool remained a priority for him and his side.

He still, though, played a raft of his fringe stars in an attempt to keep his squad fresh ahead of the hectic festive period.

And the visitors made a bright start, Roberto Soldado just failing to get a head on Nacer Chadli's dangerous cross from the left in the sixth minute before the first blackout two minutes later.

The home support did their best to brighten up proceedings as thousands of camera phones lit up the pitch black stadium.

And to their credit, the blackout didn't dampen the noise coming from the small but vociferous home support.

Likewise, club officials were determined not to let the floodlight failure ruin proceedings, blaring some rather questionable Turkish disco music over the PA system

You could forgive the handful of Spurs fans who made the trip to Istanbul for thinking they were in some dodgy nightclub in Taksim Square rather than a football match. 

Tottenham's Europa League encounter against Besiktas had to be suspended for 13 minutes after the lights went out in the stadium

Finally, after a 15 minute delay the players re-emerged from the tunnel as the lights came back on.

And the intermission slowed the early momentum Spurs had started to gather as Besiktas shifted up a gear.

The hosts were chasing and throwing themselves into tackles like qualification into the next round depended on it.

Perhaps it was the sight of manager Slaven Bilic - in a suit and beanie hat - geeing them up at every opportunity in his technical area.

However, Soldado missed an excellent chance in the 16th minute to take the lead, failing to capitalise on Paulinho's clever flick deep inside the penalty area.

Andros Townsend had the ball in the net in the 26th minute following Mousa Dembele's through ball - but his well-executed chipped finish was ruled out for offside.

Olcay Sahan then went close, firing a curling right-foot strike narrowly wide of Michel Vorm's far post four minutes later, before Soldado chose to cross instead of shoot in a good position after Townsend's clever reverse pass.

Despite both sides having already qualified for the next round, there was no hint of anyone taking their foot off the gas - particularly not the hosts.

There was, though, a distinct lack of goalmouth action as the first half ended goalless. Even referee Stefan Johannesson seemed bored - blowing the half-time whistle four seconds before the 45th minute.

Pochettino would have been content, if not happy, with his side's opening 45 minutes. They were comfortable if not dominant against a side who were clearly pumped up for the occasion.

Serdar Kurtulus sent a long-range effort narrowly over the bar as the second half got underway, before Danny Rose saw his cross-cum-shot palmed away by Tolga Zengin in the 55th minute.

Besiktas forward Cenk Tosun then went agonisingly close to opening the scoring in the 58th minute, smashing a 25-yard half-volley on to the crossbar after skipper Younes Kaboul had sloppily lost possession.

But the hosts didn't have to wait much longer to take a deserved lead thanks to Tosun, who finished from close range after excellent combination play between Gokhan Tore and Sahan.

And the Turks should have doubled their lead in the 68th minute but Ersan Gulum wasted a brilliant opportunity after a defence-splitting one-two with Jose Sosa.

Spurs were on the ropes as Pochettino watched his side lose their grip on top spot in the group, and he introduced Erik Lamela and Aaron Lennon in search of an equaliser that would keep them in pole position.

But it was Besiktas who continued to look most likely, Sosa wasting another chance from deep inside the area in the 75th minute.

Spurs were toiling, and looked void of attacking ideas as the second of the evening's blackouts occurred in injury time.

By that time Tottenham's hopes of finishing top were already extinguished.
