Wreckage of German submarine U-576 was found next to the merchant vessel it sunk in its last naval battle 72 years ago off the coast of North Carolina.

Researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration discovered both ships on the ocean floor 30 miles from Cape Hatteras, the agency announced Tuesday.

'This is not just the discovery of a single shipwreck,' said chief scientist Joe Hoyt of the NOAA Office of Marine Sanctuaries expedition that made the discovery.

'We have discovered an important battle site that is part of the Battle of the Atlantic,' he added. 'These two ships rest only a few hundred yards apart and together help us interpret and share their forgotten stories.'

Merchant vessels often came under attack, and though the official count of wartime casualties is not known, the merchant marines suffered thousands of losses. 

The merchant tanker Bluefields, flying the Nicaraguan flag, was part of a 24-ship convoy with air cover on its way south from Virginia to Florida on July 14, 1942.

U-576 was at the time limping back to port in Germany, having sustained damage during a month of unsuccessfully hunting Allied shipping vessels along the American coast.

The German sub, commanded by Kapitanleutnant Hans-Dieter Heinicke, engaged the convoy, singling out the Bluefields.

'In spite of his damaged ship, Heinicke decided to attack at all costs,' a document held by the Monitor National Marine Sancturary reads. 

'However, at 4:00 pm just before he could fire his torpedoes, one of the Coast Guard cutters picked up a sonar contact.'

The Coast Guard escorts dropped a series of three depth charges, soon followed by five more.

Determined to strike against the convoy, Heinicke fired four torpedoes that sunk the Bluefields and damaged two other ships.

Kingfisher floatplanes escorting the convoy zeroed in on the sub, hitting it with depth charges, while the Unicoi merchant ship swung around its deck gun and fired.

Both vessels sank, but a grisly end awaited the crew of U-576, as all 45 sailors died aboard the doomed sub.

The NOAA ship Okeanos Explorer did the initial surveying for the wrecks based on historical records, while the SRVx Sand Tiger confirmed both ships' identities in August.

The wreck of U-576 will remain under the sovereign ownership of Germany, in accordance with US policy.

'It is international custom to view the wreckage of land, sea, and air vehicles assumed or presumed to hold the remains of fallen soldiers as war graves,' read a statement from the German Foreign Office.

'As such, they are under special protection and should, if possible, remain at their site and location to allow the dead to rest in peace.'
