Good news for sleepyheads: naps at work could save the British economy billions, say experts.

Fifteen million sick days a year are specifically attributed to tiredness, depression or anxiety - and they are costing the UK an estimated £29 billion.

Sleep experts have said that office snoozes can actually improve alertness and performance and even reduce stress.

Dozing off: One in five UK adults have a power-nap during office hours and with 55 per cent say they feel significantly more productive and less tired after they do

According to a report published by the Office of National Statistics in February, designated dozes could help avoid 131 million sick days a year.

Furthermore, the research, carried out by PriceWaterhouse Coopers and One Poll, found that one in five UK adults enjoy a catnap at work anyway, with 55 per cent saying they feel significantly more productive and less tired afterwards.

The poll questioned 2,000 Brits on their nap habits, and found that the average length of a desk doze was 15 minutes.

Men are twice as likely to fall asleep during office hours, and one in four take a work time nap at least once a week.

Interestingly,
 the research found that the younger you are, the more likely you are to 
nap at work - perhaps having something to do with this age bracket 
favouring mid-week nights out.

One in three 18-24 year olds nap at work, compared to only 22 per cent of those aged 55+.

London is the sleepiest region in the UK, with locals getting an average six hours sleep per night and with 85 per cent admitting to being ‘desperate’ for a nap during the working day.

Those in Yorkshire and Humber get the most sleep in the country – over seven hours each night.

The survey, conducted to celebrate the release of Disney’s Sleeping Beauty on Blu-ray and DVD, also looked into the most common places to take a nap.

It found that 33 per cent go to their car, 30 per cent actually sleep on their desk and 17 per cent find a private office. An estimated 38 million of us sneak off to the toilets to grab 40 winks.

TOWIE stars Lydia Bright and Chloe Simms are backing the campaign and have submitted pics of themselves napping.

Sleep Expert Sammy Margo commented: ‘Biologically we are programmed to fall asleep mid-afternoon as is the case with toddlers, the elderly and siesta cultures. Physiologically there is a slight drop in body temperature mid-afternoon.

‘This afternoon dip in mood and alertness associated with poorer performance especially after a night of sleep loss. Research shows that you can improve alertness, reduce stress and improve performance with a nap. The challenge is the conflict with our current work schedules and the fact that stimulus to nap is suppressed by caffeine.’Sleeping Beauty is on Blue-Ray, DVD and Digital Download now
