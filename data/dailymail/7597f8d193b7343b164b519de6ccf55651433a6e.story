Angelina Jolie may be called to give evidence in a phone-hacking lawsuit being brought by her stunt double in the United States.

Eunice Huthart is the first alleged victim to launch legal action against the Murdoch empire in the U.S. over claims her voicemail was hacked and messages deleted.

The British 46-year-old, who won the first series of TV game show Gladiators, claimed The Sun and the News of the World hacked her phone in an attempt to gather gossip about the Hollywood actress.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Ms Jolie is a potential witness in the case who may be called to testify.

News Corp responded in September by saying that the case should be transferred to the UK where more than 600 hacking claims were being processed under a compensation scheme.

Legal papers filed by News Corp said: 'The compensation scheme has been extraordinarily successful at delivering satisfaction to applicants: it has received 611 inquiries from individuals alleging they were victims of voicemail interception, of whom 426 applied to join the scheme, resulting in 359 being invited to join the scheme, and 272 settling their claims thus far.

'Not a single applicant to date has seen fit to take his or her case to a hearing.'

But Ms Huthart's lawyers have branded the scheme 'unfair' and insist that U.S. courts should be able to examine the 'increasing threat to privacy'.

In a statement, they said: 'No claimant has proceeded to a hearing, not because applicants are satisfied with the compensation scheme, but because [News International] controls the scheme and decides whom to accept into it.

'This effectively prevents claimants from having their day in court and from getting to the bottom of defendants' wrongdoing toward them.'

News International, the British arm of News Corp, has already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to celebrities and other public figures who were hacked by the News of the World.

The stuntwoman claims that News International papers used information found on her voicemail to uncover Ms Jolie's relationship with co-star Brad Pitt during the filming of 2005 hit Mr & Mrs Smith.

Her claims date back to 2004 and 2005 when she was apparently living with Ms Jolie - she says the pair were close friends who 'travelled and socialised together' as well as being colleagues on film sets.

Allegations: Huthart is the first alleged victim to launch legal action against Rupert Murdoch's empire in the U.S. over claims her voicemail was hacked and messages deleted

Ms Huthart worked as the actress' stunt double on Tomb Raider 2 and Beyond Borders as well as Mr & Mrs Smith.

Around the time covered by the complaint, the Sun and the News of the World, which closed down in 2011 after revelations of widespread hacking at the title came to light, ran a number of stories on the burgeoning romance between Ms Jolie and Mr Pitt.

The stuntwoman claims that the source of many of the stories was her voicemail, as 'no one except Brad Pitt's bodyguard, Ms Jolie's bodyguard, their respective personal assistants and Plaintiff knew that Brad Pitt and Ms Jolie were now an "item"'.

The court papers also allege that Ms Huthart missed a number of deleted messages from colleagues and family members, leading to inconvenience and emotional distress.

Among the messages from Ms Jolie which Ms Huthart never received were apparently 'hotel arrangements where she was staying, code names for hotels and individuals, dinner reservations, meet-up times and, on occasion, when she sought the help of Plaintiff during times of need'.

News Corp has so far refused to comment on the allegations. The company has repeatedly denied that hacking took place at the Sun.

The phone-hacking scandal came to light in 2001, when it was emerged that the News of the World had hacked into the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler.

The Sunday newspaper was closed down by Mr Murdoch, and the company has since paid out more than Â£200million in compensation and legal expenses related to the victims of hacking.

A number of former News International executives are currently facing trial for hacking-related offences.
