A Highland mansion belonging to one of Britain’s richest men - and once used by Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - is being sold at a knockdown £450,000.

The 15 bedroom Lochmore Lodge, in Sutherland, belongs to Gerald Grosvenor, the 6th Duke of Westminster.

The Duke - Britain’s richest landowner and godfather to Prince William - had wanted to demolish the run down pile, one of his least used but most historic properties, and return the site to grassland.

But after a dramatic intervention by conservation agency, Historic Scotland, the bulldozers have been halted, and the property put on the market at a bargain price.

In the London borough of Westminster, £450,000 would just be enough to buy a modest one-bedroom flat with a small kitchen/living area.

The Scottish estate has been regularly used by a host of celebrities and prominent figures as a bolthole, buried away from prying eyes.

They
 include Prince Charles, who stayed there as a 13-year-old boy when he 
visited with the Queen, and Princess Diana.  Prince Philip and Princess Anne also visited as guests of the
 Duchess of Westminster in 1961.

Other notable visitors are said to include the former prime ministers Winston Churchill and Neville Chamberlain.

However the Duke's estate has now decided to sell the Lodge which has 52 rooms including six bathrooms.

The sprawling property also boasts a library, a television room, a dressing room, a playroom and pantry.

A condition of the sale says that the lodge can only be occupied by one family - and cannot be sub-divided into flats or as multiple private residences.

Agents CKD Galbraith describe it as 'a magnificent C Listed mansion house overlooking Loch More. In need of renovation but with enormous potential. Stunning loch and mountain views.'

UK with vast land holdings also in Lancashire and Cheshire as well as 
large areas of Mayfair and Belgravia in central London

The house, which dates from around 1850, is in a sheltered woodland setting with outstanding views across its parkland gardens to Loch More and Ben Screavie.

'Lochmore Lodge is perfectly located to enjoy traditional rural sports including first class salmon fishing and deer stalking which are available on local estates,' say the agents.

'Lochmore Lodge was formerly the principal house on the Reay Forest’s Lochmore Estate. The house has been unoccupied since 2003 and now requires considerable internal renovation. 

'However, the property retains many traces of its original splendour and features throughout its 52 rooms and the Lodge, for those with vision and resources, has the potential to be restored to one of Sutherland’s premier residences.

'From the ground floor, three staircases lead to the first floor giving access to 14 bedrooms, six bathrooms and three separate WCs. These rooms are currently in need of considerable repair but contain echoes of the time when Lochmore Lodge was in its prime.'

 Via Grosvenor Estates, the 62-year-old 
Duke is the richest property developer in the UK with vast land holdings
 also in Lancashire and Cheshire as well as large areas of Mayfair and 
Belgravia in central London.

In 1677, his ancestor, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, married Mary Davies.

She had inherited 500 acres of land north of the Thames to the west of the City of London, and the family developed the area to the north - which is now what is known as Mayfair - in the 1720s.

They then moved south to Belgravia.

As well as its estate in Mayfair and Belgravia, Grosvenor Estate's assets include the Liverpool One shopping complex, and the luxury residential development 3-10 Grosvenor Crescent, in London.

It also owns the residential tower Westminster Terrace in Hong Kong.

After a dramatic intervention by Historic Scotland in 2012, the Duke had to postpone sending in the bulldozers.

The country’s top conservation body officially listed the mansion as an historically important building - meaning a presumption against demolition.

The Duke owns all the other homes at Archfary, through a trust, to house estate workers.

Historic Scotland scheduled the building as a category C listed building - the same status that protects almost half the country’s listed buildings.

The duke’s 96,000 acre estate say it costs between £20,000 and £30,000-a-year to maintain the lodge. 

Via Grosvenor Estates, the 62-year-old Duke is the richest property developer in the UK with vast land holdings also in Lancashire and Cheshire as well as large areas of Mayfair and Belgravia in central London.

The Duke - a close friend of Prince Charles and a trustee of Princess Diana’s will - also owns estates in Canada and Spain and is said to be worth £7.8billion

Local MSP Rob Gibson said in 2012 that if the Duke did not need the lodge - and there were no building issues such as asbestos - it should be converted into social housing.

The second Duke of Westminster died at the lodge in 1953 aged 74 - just a month after attending the Queen’s coronation.

His widow Anne died there 50 years later and it has been empty ever since. The couple had no children together.
