They arrived in full dinner suits, glittery all-in-one numbers and the latest in jacket fashions - but this is not Paris Fashion Week.

It is day three of Crufts 2015 where the preened and pampered of the canine world gather to compete in the world's biggest dog breed competition.

From Afghans in headdresses, to a terrier in a pram, day three of the event at the NEC arena in Birmingham has seen some incredible sights.

Today is the turn of Hounds and Terriers to take centre stage with breeds ranging from West Highland White's to shaggy-looking Komondor's all on show.

The four-day event is the world's largest dog show with beloved pets competing in categories include agility, heelwork to music and the ever-popular flyball final.

There were various displays from groups including the the West Midlands Police and the Southern Golden Retriever display team

Thursday saw the Gundogs do their thing, yesterday featured the Working and Pastoral categories and tomorrow will mark the finale of the competition with the Toy and Utility dogs.

There are also a number of events solely for children and their dogs

It has changed in ways that couldn’t possibly have been imagined when the show was set up in Victorian times by the late Charles Cruft. Although it was a very different event in 1891 Charles Cruft was a great showman and would surely have enjoyed the size and scope of the event today, which is an essential date in any dog lover’s calendar.

Although there is a packed schedule of contests for the dogs to take part in, for much of the time they left waiting around for their event to start.

Each animals is assigned a sleeping area, which many of the owners decorate with cushions, pictures and rosettes from previous competitions.

The dog show is still an important part of the event, celebrating the unique relationship that dogs share with their owners. Judges are trained to ensure that only healthy dogs win prizes, which in turn encourages the breeding of healthy dogs. But the event is now about so much more besides.

Crufts is ultimately a celebration of all dogs. It celebrates working dogs, such as those in the Gamekeeper classes or which line up for the Police Dog Team Operational and Humanitarian Action of the Year award. 

The dogs compete in various events to test their obedience and agility in order to be named Best In Show.
