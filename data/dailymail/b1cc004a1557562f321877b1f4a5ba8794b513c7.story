Revealed: This is the prototype of the badge which senior Tories are planning to wear in the Commons next week

This is the badge which senior Conservatives are planning to wear in an 
extraordinary show of defiance against Commons Speaker John Bercow 
following a series of intemperate outbursts against the party’s MPs.

A group including several ministers 
has formed what has been called ‘the BBB Club’, members of which 
complain they have been ‘Bol****ed By Bercow’.

Transport minister Simon Burns has designed a prototype badge featuring three bees - a reference to the BBB club name - which Tory MPs and ministers plan to wear to the last Prime Minister’s 
Questions before Parliament’s summer recess next week.

The design of the badge also appears calculated to poke fun at the Speaker’s extreme phobia of wasps and bees, which is said to date back to his childhood.

According to a biography of Mr Bercow, he was mocked at school for his terror of flying insects and was once thrown into a biology pond.

Those understood to have been 
approached about joining the revolt include ministers Michael Gove, 
and Anna Soubry, former minister Tim Loughton and 
backbenchers Jason McCartney, Simon Kirby and Ian Liddell-Grainger.

Conservative MP Sheryll Murray, who 
has produced badges calling for an EU referendum and the No to AV 
campaign, has been asked to make the ‘BBB’ badges in time for next week,
 one of the rebel MPs told the Daily Mail.

Such a move would be an unprecedented 
snub to the Speaker, whose often fractious relations with Tory MPs have 
been stretched to breaking point by spectacular outbursts in recent 
weeks.

Tory anger over his alleged bias 
against the party was intensified yesterday as he cut David Cameron off 
as he attacked Labour over its donations from the trade unions, waving 
his hand dismissively until the Prime Minister’s microphone was cut off 
while he was still speaking.

MPs claim the Speaker’s behaviour from
 the chair has been increasingly ‘eccentric’ in recent weeks, with 
Tories bearing the brunt. His outbursts have even led to speculation in 
Westminster that his marriage to wife Sally may be under strain.

A series of eruptions began when he 
launched an extraordinary attack on Mr Liddell-Grainger, the 
mild-mannered Bridgwater and West Somerset MP, who he accused of 
heckling at a Labour MP.

Mr Bercow yelled: ‘Be quiet, and if 
you cannot be quiet, get out. You are adding nothing, and you are 
subtracting a lot. It is rude, it is stupid, it is pompous and it needs 
to stop.’

But to the Speaker’s embarrassment, 
Tory Minister Alan Duncan admitted that he was the heckler, with Mr 
Liddell-Grainger the innocent party.

Health minister Miss Soubry was 
attacked three times by the Speaker, who declared that she ‘thinks her 
views are relevant, but we are not interested’.

Later in the week, he issued an 
extraordinary rebuke of respected Defence Secretary Philip Hammond over 
his handling of a Commons statement on the Territorial Army, accusing 
him of being ‘utterly incompetent’ and ‘woefully inadequate’ and giving a
 strong suggestion that he considered him a bore.

The same day, he attacked transport 
minister Mr Burns, who turned on Labour MPs who were heckling him. A 
furious Mr Bercow accused Mr Burns of hypocrisy and said he was a ‘slow 
learner’ who had to ‘raise his game’. The minister was heard muttering 
that the Speaker was a ‘silly little man’.

The previous week, Tory MPs claim the 
Speaker failed to discipline a Labour MP who allegedly made an offensive
 gesture to Chancellor George Osborne during his statement on the 
spending review.

Witnesses say Tory backbencher Jason 
McCartney wrote the name of the offending Labour MP on a note and handed
 it to the Speaker only to see Mr Bercow tear it up in fury.

Yesterday, at Prime Minister’s 
Questions, the Speaker again turned his ire on the Conservative benches,
 though Labour MPs were making far more noise at one of the rowdiest 
recent sessions.

He told MP Michael Ellis, a former 
lawyer: ‘You find it so difficult to control yourself. I am sure you did
 not when you were practising at the Bar. Calm it, man! Get a grip of 
the situation!’

Tory MPs have privately commissioned 
research from the Commons library which suggests that Mr Bercow is far 
quicker to rebuke his old Conservative colleagues than their Labour 
counterparts.

The study showed that over a six-month
 period the Speaker reprimanded 15 Tory MPs for heckling or interrupting
 during debates, and only two Labour MPs.

He rebuked 16 Conservative MPs for 
other examples of alleged misconduct, compared to two Labour MPs, one 
Liberal Democrat and one Scottish Nationalist.

Mr Bercow has long been viewed 
suspiciously by Tory MPs. They suspect the Buckingham MP, once a 
hardline Right-winger, began an extraordinary move across the political 
spectrum after realising he would only get the job of Speaker with 
Labour support.

He won only a handful of Tory votes in
 a House of Commons secret ballot, securing the job thanks to massive 
support on the Labour benches. The exact number is hotly disputed, but 
is thought to be barely into double figures.

If an MP objects to Mr Bercow’s 
re-election as Speaker after the next election in 2015, an open ballot 
will have to be held of the entire Commons.
