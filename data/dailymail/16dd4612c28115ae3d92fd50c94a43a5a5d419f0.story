A judge has said he will take 30 days to decide whether the rights to Casey Anthony's life story can be sold by her trustee to pay off debt as part of her bankruptcy proceedings.

Miss Anthony, who was acquitted almost two years ago of killing her daughter Caylee, filed for bankruptcy in January and appeared in court last month, claiming that she has debts of almost $800,000.

Tampa-based bankruptcy trustee Stephen Meininger wants to sell off the rights to Miss Anthony's story claiming that it is her best bet for paying back the estimated $792,000 she owes.

Most of Miss Anthony's debts are owed to her defence lawyers, with the original bankruptcy petition claiming that she owns a little over $1,000 in assets.

But Miss Anthony does not want to sell her story and her attorneys strongly disagree with Mr Meininger's proposed unprecedented legal move.

Judge K. Rodney May will announce his decision whether to allow the worldwide exclusive rights to her life story to be auctioned off to the highest bidder in 30 days, but admits that he is 'sceptical' about the controversial proposal.

One bidder, a Texan attorney named James Schober, has reportedly put in an offer of $10,000 dollars on the condition that Anthony's story never sees the light of day and that she makes no profit from it.

Mr Meininger says that one other offer has been tabled so far for $12,000 from a New York man who intends to use the story for 'entertainment value'.

Others are said to have expressed an interest.

Miss Anthony's lawyers have described the proposal to sell off something that only exists in their client's memory as 'Orwellian'.

According to NBCNews.com, their filing argues: 'By allowing property that can only be created by post-petition labor to be sold as part of the bankruptcy estate, a debtor would never be able to achieve a "fresh start".

'Perhaps more troubling, the Order sought by the Trustee would result in the judicial invasion and taking of thoughts and memories that have not been memorialized but are contained solely within the debtor’s mind.'

Notorious: Anthony became nationally notorious after she was accused of murdering Caylee, whose body was found six months after she went missing in June 2008. The pair are pictured together here

Their case also argues that a ruling in favour of the sale could damage Miss Anthony's personal relationships as she would be unable to even discuss her memories with family members over email or any 'social media' under the terms of Mr Schober's offer.

Her listed debts include $500,000 for attorney fees and costs for her criminal defense lawyer during the trial, Jose Baez; $145,660 for the Orange County Sheriff's office for a judgment covering investigative fees and costs related to the case; $68,540 for the Internal Revenue Service for back taxes, interest and penalties; and $61,505 for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for court costs.

Anthony became nationally notorious after she was accused of murdering Caylee, whose body was found six months after she went missing in June 2008.

Suspicion fell on the girl's mother because she did not report her daughter missing for a month and was seen at the time partying.

She was arrested and put on trial for Caylee's murder, but in July 2011 was acquitted of the killing.

A new hearing will be heard in 30 days.

Broke: Anthony testified that she has no money and is living off of donations at her bankruptcy hearing in March

Out of hiding: She appeared in public for the first time since she was cleared of murder charges in the death of her daughter Caylee at her initial bankruptcy hearing last month
