Humans might be wowing the world with their icy stunts and blistering speed on snow at the Winter Olympics.

But Britain’s only arctic animal is perfectly built for racing down snowy slopes and leaping long distances, without any expensive sporting equipment.

The hardy mountain hare is a natural athlete native to Scotland and is built to cope with cold weather.

The mountain hare (Lepus timidus) is adapted to polar and mountainous habitats.

It lives in the Scottish Highlands and England's Peak District in the UK.

It can reach 65cm in length and can weigh up to 5.3kg.

In the summer, the mountain hare has a brown coat but in preparation for winter it moults into a white pelage.

However, its tail stays white all year round, distinguishing the species from the European hare.

Most active in the evening and at night, mountain hares rest with their backs to the wind, sheltered by rocks and heather in the day time.

Some wildlife experts are concerned that as global warming reduces the amount of snowfall in parts of the UK, the survival of mountain hares could be threatened as they risk being exposed in the wrong colour coat. 

They are preyed upon by foxes, stoats, birds of prey and cats.

The animals live in arctic conditions in countries from Scandinavia to eastern Siberia, as well as in Britain.

In addition to powerful legs which allow them to leap long distances and race across snowy slopes, mountain hares have the ability to turn their fur white during colder months to blend into their surroundings and avoid predators.

Photographer Tim Stenton, 49, who regularly travels to Scotland to take wildlife pictures, spent two days in the Highlands photographing the hares.

‘It was incredible to be so close to these amazing creatures and watch them go about their business,’ he said.

‘To avoid predators they have learned a 
trick of standing completely still for long periods of time - eagles 
can't spot motionless prey.

‘Then, suddenly, they will run away 
really fast. They take off, getting air as they leap over the hillsides -
 this is the best of Britain's animal winter Olympians,’ he added.

Some species of hares can reach top speeds of 45mph - roughly equivalent to the average course speed for an Olympic downhill skier.  They can also leap three metres in a single bound.

Earlier this month, Mr Stenton, from Wirksworth in Derbyshire spent between four and five hours a day photographing the hares.

‘It was a great experience. I was surrounded by some of the most beautiful countryside in the world. The Scottish Highlands look incredible covered in the recent snow,’ he said.

‘I have never followed hares around before and I now think they are fascinating creatures. They are not hard to photograph once you know where they are.’ He added.

Ben Hoare of BBC Wildlife magazine, said: ‘Mountain hares are Britain's only truly arctic mammal. They are unbelievably tough animals and thrive on our wildest mountainsides even in the depths of winter.

Secretive: The hares need this to blend in with their surroundings because their main enemy - the golden eagle - has eyesight up to eight times sharper than a human's and can spot its dinner from hundreds of metres away

‘They're brilliant escape artists, moulting into pure white coats to blend in with the snow. When they hunker down against the ground, only their black ear tips give them away. In spring when the snow and ice melts, they grow back their brown coats.

‘The hares really do need this amazing camouflage because their main enemy - the golden eagle - has eyesight up to eight times sharper than ours and can spot its dinner from hundreds of metres away.’

Mountain hares are native to Britain - unlike brown hares in the lowlands, which the Romans probably brought here. But you'll have to go to the Scottish Highlands or England's Peak District to see them.’
