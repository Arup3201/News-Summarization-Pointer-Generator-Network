It's an adage as old as time itself: if you want something to taste really delicious, dump it in a vat of boiling hot oil.

At least, that's always been true when it comes to cooking doughnuts, those sinfully decadent deep-fried cakes stuffed with jam and cream and toffee and goo and whatnot, averaging about 18g of fat per individual treat - an enormous 90 per cent of the recommended daily fat allowance for a woman.

Until now. One (moderately) health-conscious British artisan chef has taken it upon himself to reduce the fat content in doughnuts without reducing the taste experience.

And Paul Hurley, creator of Dum Dum Doughnuts, has started by cutting out the deep-fat frying altogether, choosing to bake his scrumptious morsels instead.

Healthy treat? Dum Dums doughnuts are baked instead of fried so have a reduced fat content compared to regular deep-fried doughnuts

Speaking to MailOnline, Paul, who used to work for Dunkin' Donuts, said: 'I've been trying to create the world's best doughnut since 1997, but you can't just think about flavour, you need to also think about ethics: what people should be eating, and what they should be letting their kids eat.

'Since we bake rather than fry you've already halved the fat content of a regular doughnut.

'Obviously we then add things like cream and jam and chocolate which bump up the calories and fat, but it will always be lower in fat than a doughnut that's been floating in hot oil for a couple of minutes. We don't even own a deep-fat fryer!

'Our jam doughnuts will have around 6g of fat in them as opposed to the equivalent deep-fried ones which will have about 18g. And about 350kcal compared to about 450.'

He continued: 'The thing is, we're all adults. We want to give people choice. But if you're going to have a treat, make it a really fabulous one.'

The team at Dum Dums is comprised entirely of trained pastry chefs, and all ingredients are fresh and natural: a strawberry creme doughnut contains fresh fruit rather than E-numbers and strawberry flavouring.

'We make everything from scratch with a baking process we've developed over the past 10 years.'

Dum Dums come in regular doughnut and croissant doughnut varieties, but Paul insists he isn't jumping on the cronut bandwagon.

'The concept of a croissant doughnut has been around for years - just think of the yum yum. It's only the clever name "cronut" that is actually new.

'One
 of our doughnuts - Pete's Yum Yum Dum Dum - is a big yum yum filled 
with buttercream and dulce de leche caramel with a glaze. It was 
especially commissioned for Peter Andre when he asked for one.'

The Dum Dum Donutterie will be open at Box Park, in Shoreditch, east London, from the 25 February.

The baked doughnuts will be made freshly on a daily basis and will be sold on a first come basis.

The
 current pop-up Donutterie at Westfield Straford City is open all week 
until this Sunday. The doughnuts have been selling out every day around 
3pm.

Traditional 
American-style doughnuts cost £1.80 each, £6 for a box of six. Dum Dums 
baked croissant doughnuts are £3 each or two for £5.

Reducing the fat content in something renowned for its devilishly high lard-count seldom turns out well.

Low-fat crisps are toe-curlingly cardboardy, fat-free cheese has the texture of aged rubber, and mayonnaise without fat tastes more like craft glue than anything you'd fancy putting in a sandwich.

So what about doughnuts? Would removing the final cooking step - namely, 'deep-fry until outer pastry layer is crackling-crisp, and inside has absorbed just enough oil to soften slightly' - be the kiss-of-death for this King of Cakes?

Team Femail took a box of Dum Dums into the lab (read: back office) to do the all-important taste test....

Bianca London:

'I'm not a huge fan of doughnuts, and these "healthy" versions definitely didn't change my mind. They were still coated in sugar - and we all know that's the real bad guy when it comes to ingredients.

'Plus, mine was stuffed cream. Since when are cream and sugar healthy? At least if they'd put some apple sauce in there it would have seemed healthy. For 300 calories I would much rather have six apples, or even three Cadbury Freddo bars.'

Martha de Lacey:

'They may not be deep-fried, but these delicious little calorific cretins are anything but "healthy". While they do perhaps taste marginally less oily than other big-name doughnut brands, flaky butter pastry, whipped cream, fudge sauce, nuts, jam and icing sugar, do not a happy nutritionist make.

'Nonetheless, that didn't stop me demolishing two of the insanely decadent blighters. Ignore the health aspect and enjoy Dum Dums for what they are: indulgent, cronut-style treats. They're scrumptious.'

Lisa Potter:

'I'm not a big doughnut fan, but one that promises all the flavour without the guilt was too tempting not to try. I couldn't tell the difference between this one and a regular calorie-laden one!'

Martha Cliff:

'My first experience of a Dum Dum's cronut was a delicious if messy one. Filled with cream, you'd think it would require a good few days on the treadmill to burn off. But if each one is really under 300 calories it's the equivalent of two Nutrigrain bars - and I know which I'd rather.

'The downside? A hole in the centre of a cream-filled cake just creates more opportunities for spillage. It may be less calorific than your average doughnut, but scooping cream off your lap is not the most sophisticated of looks.'
