A Hong Kong woman who tortured her Indonesian maid in a case that sparked worldwide outrage has been handed a six-year jail sentence.

Law Wan-tung was sentenced after her conviction earlier this month on eight charges of assault, grievous bodily harm and criminal intimidation against 24-year-old Erwiana Sulistyaningsih.

The brutal case highlighted the vulnerabilities of migrants working as domestic staff across Asia and the Middle East.

District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock said she was 'sure' Law, seen above leaving the court last month, did assault, wound and threaten Ms Sulistyaningsih as charged 

The mother-of-two, 45, had no reaction as the sentence was handed down by District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock, who said 'the seriousness of the charges and circumstances of the offences means a lengthy prison time is appropriate.'

The judge fined Law 15,000 Hong Kong dollars (£1,250) for 10 charges of failing to pay wages or grant time off. She had earlier pleaded guilty to one other charge of failing to buy insurance.

It gained widespread attention about a year ago after photos of her injuries circulated among Indonesians in Hong Kong. They showed her face, hands and legs covered with scabs and lacerations, and blackened, peeling skin around her feet.

Speaking through an interpreter outside court, she told reporters: 'I am so happy because finally my employer is in prison although only for six years. But for me, finally justice is delivered,'

District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock said Law had a definite 'lack of compassion' and her 'contempt was reserved for those she saw as beneath her.' 

The court heard that Law punched Ms Sulistyaningsih in the mouth, fracturing some teeth; jammed a metal vacuum cleaner tube in her mouth, cutting her lip; and hit her on the back with a feather duster when she was sleeping. Law also forced the maid to stand naked in the bathroom during winter while she splashed water on and pointed a fan at her.

Ms Sulistyaningsih, who worked for Law for about eight months starting in June 2013, wasn't allowed any days off and was not paid her salary.

Law was found not guilty of two other charges. After the verdict earlier this month, supporters applauded Ms Sulistyaningsih who said she was happy 'because I will get the justice from Hong Kong'.

There are about 330,000 foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong, almost all female and most from the Philippines or Indonesia, earning a minimum wage of about £328 a month.
