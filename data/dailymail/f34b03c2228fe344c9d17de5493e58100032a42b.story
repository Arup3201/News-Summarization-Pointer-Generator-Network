NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates: Heads' jobs are important

Around 30 headteachers are being paid more than the Prime Minister in defiance of new rules designed to curb huge salaries.

Outrage over soaring public sector pay packets previously led the Government to say that they should generally be lower than the Prime Minister’s salary, who earns £142,500 year.

And last week the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) said that heads could receive up to £132,685 in exceptional circumstances, rising to £141,250 in inner London.

But the guidance from the independent STRB said that normally, the maximum pay for someone in charge of ‘multiple very large schools’ should be £106,148 or £113,000 in central London.

However the Daily Mail can reveal that up to 31 headteachers already receive more than David Cameron. Four are paid at least £170,000, while another 13 get more than £150,000 and 14 have an income of at least £140,000.

The superhead salaries top a table of 830 school leaders on six-figure sums. And at least 230 teachers are known to be earning £110,000 or more.

The surge in numbers is believed to have been fuelled by the rise of academy schools in recent years, which are centrally funded but free from local authority control, giving them power over areas including staff pay.

There are around 3,600 at present, up from 2,600 a year ago – suggesting that more headteachers will now be earning bumper pay packages. These could act as a drain on public finances for decades to come, as many heads retire on taxpayer-funded pensions which are worth half their salary.

The figures also show that senior teachers – including headteachers and deputy or assistant heads – earn £61,000 on average. At academies the figure is around £1,000 more. However ordinary full-time teachers are paid an average salary which is worth under £38,000.

Jonathan Isaby, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Good headteachers, especially the ones that are turning around poorly performing schools, will attract a premium.

Desperation: State schools are increasingly asking for donations from parents, it has been claimed

‘But parents and taxpayers should be able to routinely scrutinise pay deals so they can judge for themselves whether they’re getting good value for money.’

And Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said: ‘School leaders have highly responsible and important jobs and their salary should reflect this.

‘But the combination of increased autonomy for schools and weak governance is failing to provide the appropriate regulation and scrutiny to ensure that headteachers’ salaries are determined in an open, fair and transparent manner. The opportunity for abuse is significant.’

A spokesman from the Department for Education said: ‘We asked the School Teachers’ Review Body to make recommendations to ensure pay is always appropriate to the set of challenges the headteacher faces and the contribution they make to the school they lead.’

However the spokesman stressed that schools needed to be given some freedom over salaries in order to be able to recruit and retain the best candidates.
