There are many ways to be labelled 'A bad girl' in the UK, including stealing from the tuck-shop, cheating in an exam and smoking behind the bike sheds. 

But in India, the bar for being a disappointment to society is much, much lower.  

A group of students from the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology in Bangalore made a tongue-in-cheek poster detailing the qualities a young women needs in India to be considered 'bad'.

The poster by students at the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology in Bangalore details things that a bad girl does in India 

The project came about after the pupils were given an assignment to contrast different images from popular culture. 

They decided to base a poster on an Indian old print from the 1980's that listed the good things an 'Ideal Boy' does, including 'greeting your parents', 'eat meals on time' and 'get up early'. 

In contrast, the new poster made by the students shows that a bad girl 'can't make round rotis', 'has breasts', and 'falls in love in a park.' 

The group also made a poster that lists things that bad girls own, including a pregnancy test, condoms and cigarettes, but some of the items are far more innocent, including an iPhone, lipstick, and a short skirt. 

They also created a posted that detailed the items a bad girl owns 

The assignment was given by teacher Alison Byres, who told the Wall Street Journal that her her students regularly bring up the topic of a 'Bad Girl' in her classes nowadays. 

She said: 'It seems like there’s nothing you can do to be the perfect girl because being a girl itself appears to be the problem.'

The poster was based on a 1980s poster that detailed everything an ideal boy does 

Student Furqan Jawed, who originally posted the image to Facebook said he was shocked by the attention it has received so far. 

He told BBC Trending: 'We did not mean it to become social propaganda. 

'It was done as part of an assignment.'

The poster comes just a few weeks after a woman who uploaded a brutally honest 'Marriage CV' to the internet after discovering her parents had posted a profile of their daughter on a dating site.

Indhuja Pillai, 23, from Bangalore, couldn't believe her eyes when she saw the account that her well-meaning parents had created in order to find her a husband.

She decided to build her own description, with a no-holds-barred description of her likes, dislikes and general demeanor and posted it on a blogging site.

The profile reads: 'I wear glasses and look dorky in them. Not a spendthrift or a shopaholic.

'Detest masala & drama, not a TV fan. I don't read.

'NOT a womanly woman. Definitely not marriage material. Won't grow long hair, ever.'
