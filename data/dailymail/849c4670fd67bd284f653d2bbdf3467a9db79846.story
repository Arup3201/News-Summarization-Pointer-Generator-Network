West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is confident his team can beat Southampton in Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash despite their injury woes.

The Hammers are without five players through injury while Diafra Sakho is doubtful for the encounter at Upton Park.

The Senegal striker hurt his back during Tuesday's Capital One Cup exit to Sheffield United.

'We still have (Andy) Carroll, (Matthew) Jarvis, (Carl) Jenkinson, (Kevin) Nolan and (James) Collins out,' Allardyce said in Thursday's press conference. 'Sakho tweaked his back on Tuesday too so we're not sure if he'll be fit for Saturday.

'You don't want to be faced with that many injuries, but we're looking pretty good with the way we are playing.'

West Ham head into the game having been knocked out of the League Cup in the second round by the Blades.

Allardyce made nine changes to the team that won 3-1 at Crystal Palace last weekend to face Nigel Clough's men.

Despite a solid display, they lost 5-4 on penalties after Enner Valencia, who earned his first West Ham start against the Blades, missed the crucial penalty in the shootout following a 1-1 draw after 120 minutes.

And Allardyce is disappointed he will not get the chance to blood more young players in the latter stages of the competition.

'It's a shame we got knocked out because it would have been great for the Burkes, the Pottses and the Poyets to play more in those type of games,' the 59-year-old manager said. 'We have to keep developing them in training.

'The young lads put on a good show.'

Doubtful: Diafra Sakho is unlikely to be fit to face Southampton this Saturday after hurting his back during Tuesday's Capital Cup One tie with Sheffield United on Tuesday

Next up: Allardyce's (left) side face Ronald Koeman's (right) Southampton this Saturday 

Allardyce has warned his players to expect a highly-motivated Southampton side on Saturday.

The Saints lost 2-1 at Liverpool in their Premier League opener before holding West Brom to a goalless draw.

Ronald Koeman's men travel to London again on the back of Tuesday's 2-0 triumph at Millwall that earned them a spot in the third round of the League Cup.

'With a new manager, Southampton will have players who want to impress him,' Allardyce said. 'Having watched the Liverpool game they put up a good performance and then got a draw at home.

'We need a little more consistency in front of goal and we'll be fine.'

Allardyce revealed he is looking to make one more signing before the end of the transfer window but ruled out any further exits.

'We have the budget for one quality player and that's a possibility before the window shuts,' he said. 'I can't see anyone going the other way at the moment.

'Then we have an international window and that's good for us with the injury list.'
