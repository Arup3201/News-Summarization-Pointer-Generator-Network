An 18-year-old nearly died after what she thought was the flu turned out to be a rare flesh-eating bacteria that she may have got from shaving her legs.

Kaylee Queen, from Burton, Michigan, was taken to the hospital by her family after she developed a raised rash across her body.

Doctors suspect that she could have contracted the infection while shaving her legs, where the rash first appeared.

Serious operation: Kaylee Queen had tissue and muscle that were destroyed by the bacteria removed at the hospital

Difficult road: Kaylee is now out of intensive care and slowly recovering from the terrifying experience

She was admitted on to the ward around a week ago and kept there for days because she was not improving.

Doctors discovered that Kaylee had been victim of a double attack by two kinds of bacteria - the flesh-eating type and another that they have still not identified.

Frightened: Dianna Queen said the week in which no one had known if her daughter would recover had been 'horrifying'

'She had a band starting from her leg and up to abdomen and her side and it was a raised rash,' said her mother Dianna.

'It was like two inches, like a warped rash. It was literally spreading up her body.'

The terrified teenager then had to call her family to tell them that doctors were taking her into surgery.

She had to have tissue and muscle removed after it had been destroyed by the bacteria, according to abc12.com.

Luckily she pulled through and awoke asking for chicken soup and her phone.

Kaylee is now slowly improving and should be back to normal after two or three months.

She has moved out of intensive care and a fund has been set up in her name.

Her mother said it had been a horrifying experience. 'She knows how close she came and how serious it is and she's looking at it as a second chance in life,' added Mrs Queen.

The frightening case follows a spate of infections by flesh-eating bacteria.

Aimee Copeland, from Georgia, became known across the world after she lost her hands, leg and foot to an infection she contracted after cutting herself on a zip wire.

Just last month 33-year-old Crystal Spencer, who is from Michigan like Kaylee, was fighting for her life after apparently becoming infected during an operation to remove an abscess.
