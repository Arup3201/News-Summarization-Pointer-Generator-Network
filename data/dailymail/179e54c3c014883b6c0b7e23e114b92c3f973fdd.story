A married Tory activist who was brought to court as one of Nigel Evans’s alleged victims last night spoke of his astonishment that he had to give evidence about an incident that was simply a ‘bit of a laugh’.

Prosecutors claimed the former Deputy Speaker had tried to put his hand down the trousers of the party worker at a Conservative Party conference more than ten years ago.

But last night the 35-year-old dismissed the alleged incident involving him as just a ‘bit of drunken misbehaviour’ that was ‘not in any shape or form a crime’.

A married Tory activist, brought to court as one of Nigel Evans' alleged victims, has told of his astonishment that he had to give evidence about an incident that was simply a 'bit of a laugh'

The man – in his 20s when it was claimed the event took place in a bar in Blackpool in October 2003 – said the CPS and police had been ‘over-zealous’ in their decision to take Mr Evans, 56, to court for the alleged indecent assault.

‘I would definitely have not called myself a victim,’ he said. ‘It was nothing more than some banter among friends.

‘It genuinely astonishes me that I was in court having to give evidence on something that was nothing more than a bit of a laugh and a joke. It is very, very surreal.’

After Mr Evans was arrested for rape in May last year, the man said he did not contact police because  he did not believe he was a victim of a criminal offence. But a Tory councillor who was also in the bar reported it to police.

In his statement to police, the man wrote: ‘I would like to categorically state I have no ill-feeling or malice to Mr Evans. I do not wish Mr Evans to be charged as a result of what happened to me.

‘I am making this statement after a witness reported the incident.’

Mr Evans was re-arrested and charged with indecent assault. Of the seven alleged victims, three did not consider an offence had been committed against them.

The man last night said he was ‘relieved’ that Mr Evans had been cleared.

The former Deputy Speaker of the Commons was cleared after a jury at Preston Crown Court took less than six hours to acquit him of nine sex charges against seven men

He said: ‘Do I think that he should spend even an hour of time in jail for what happened to me? No. It never even occurred to me that it would be a police matter and would end up in court.

‘I made it clear to the police all along that I did not think he should be charged.

‘It does not surprised me in the slightest that he has been found not guilty. I think that is entirely right in the count involving me’

He believes that Mr Evans’s reputation has been wrongly tarnished by the CPS bringing the case.

He said: ‘I feel sorry for Nigel. I think that unfortunately everyone is innocent until proven guilty unless you are a politician.

‘MPs have got a fairly thick skin, but to have your sex life dragged up in public and be the subject of gossip is horrific.

‘Unfortunately he had a job he loved and job he was good at as deputy speaker and it will be very hard for him to recover again.’

He added: ‘Nigel is someone who is genuinely well liked across the political divide.

‘He is seen as friendly, humorous and someone who is very good at his job.

‘Maybe Nigel had a bit of a problem with drink, but he is not predatory or a bad person by any stretch of the imagination.’

The man said he had seen Mr Evans since 2003, but they had never talked about the alleged incident.

He said: ‘We never talked about what happened because it was something in the past. On the few occasions I have spoken to him I’ve got on perfectly well with him and we’ve had a good gossip about party policy and things like that. I feel absolutely no animosity towards Nigel whatsoever.

‘I hope that he rebuilds his life as best as he can now he has been cleared on all counts. I wish him all the best. I am sure the CPS will be reviewing the case.’

'I would like to categorically state I 
have no ill-feeling or malice to Mr Evans. I do not wish Mr Evans to be 
charged as a result of what happened to me'

The court heard that the man had complained to MP Conor Burns after he claimed a ‘plastered’ Mr Evans had twice tried to put his hands down his trousers while drinking late at night.

Last night, the man said that he had only reported the event because he did not want Mr Evans, who was at the time shadow spokesman for Wales, to be embarrassed in front of journalists who were also drinking in the bar and had wanted someone to send him to bed.

He said: ‘I was actually more embarrassed for him than I was for myself. When you have got a fairly senior MP who is acting in a drunken and foolish way, you don’t want them to wake up the next day with their name all over the place when they have not been in control of things.’

The man said that although he had not wanted Mr Evans to be prosecuted, he decided he should go to court and tell the truth about what happened.
