Safe: Police now confirm Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson is safe after a missing persons report was filed by her nephew on Saturday

In the whirlwind of bizarre family allegations over Michael Jackson's will and the disappearance of his 82-year-old mother and beneficiary to his estate, police say they have now been in contact with Katherine Jackson reported missing since Saturday.

Katherine Jackson, the mother of Michael Jackson and guardian of his three children, is safe and with a family member in Arizona, authorities said late on Sunday, one day after another relative reported her missing to police.

Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputy Mark Pope said investigators made contact with Mrs Jackson, but he did not have specifics on her whereabouts.

The agency previously said they believed she was with a relative and safe, but wanted to speak with her, a request that went unanswered.

'Mother is safe and well in Arizona with her daughter and our sister, 
Rebbie, resting up on doctor's advice, so it is beyond me how she can be
reported "missing,"' her son Jermaine Jackson said in a statement late on Sunday.

He said access to his mother is not being blocked but that her access to phones and computers was removed for her well being.

'Furthermore, it dismays me that such an alarmist "missing person" report has caused unnecessary anxiety among Michael's children who will understandably react to what they misunderstand, hear or are told,' he said.

Appeal: Paris Jackson, Michael's 14-year-old daughter, tweeted her concerns for her grandmother on Sunday morning

Concerned: The late-singer's teenage daughter Paris asked for help finding her grandmother while concerned she's in the care of a man she disproves of

Katherine is guardian to her son Michael's three 
children, Paris, Blanket and Prince, but her grandchildren reported losing 
contact with her for a week's time, prompted a missing person report on 
Saturday night by her nephew, Trent Jackson.

With her three grandchildren and 
herself being sole beneficiaries to his estate, Mrs Jackson's 
disappearance occurred at the same time of a brewing battle among other 
family members over his will believed faked after his death in June of 
2009.

Worried for her grandmother's safety,
Michael Jackson’s daughter Paris tweeted on early Sunday that she 
wanted her to return home.

‘yes,
my grandmother is missing. i haven't spoken with her in a week i want 
her home now,' the 14-year-old tweeted adding a number to call if there 
was any word.

It was unclear who is taking care of the children in Mrs Jackson's absence.

At the same time of Paris' pleas for help, her uncle Jermaine tweeted his own of assurance that his mother was safe and being taken care of during a time of medical need, naming a mini-stroke in recent months.

Reassuring: Michael's brother Jermaine assured that his mother is resting under doctor's orders but without her grandchildren claiming to know much more

That stroke was initially disputed by the teen who tweeted that ‘nothing had happened to her.’ The tweet was later deleted.

The incident demonstrated divisions 
in the Jackson family just days after five of the singer's siblings once
again claimed that the King of Pop's will was a fake and that the 
executors of his lucrative estate should step down.

The undated letter, signed by Janet, 
Randy, Tito, Rebbie and Jermaine Jackson, claimed Katherine Jackson was 
being manipulated by the executors, John Branca and John McClain, her 
health had been affected, and she suffered a mini-stroke.

The estate has denied the 
accusations, which have swirled since Michael Jackson died from an 
overdose of a powerful anesthetic. Katherine Jackson obtained permission
from a judge to investigate the will's validity, but never pursued the 
matter in court.

Paris later hearing her grandmother was sent 
away on doctor's orders did little to calm the teen, however, who 
expressed concern of a possibly more dangerous situation brewing.

‘the same doctor that testified on 
behalf of dr murray saying my father was a drug addict (a lie) is caring
for my grandmother... just saying,’ she wrote.

Radar Online identified that doctor as Dr Allan Metzger, the
same who wrote fraudulent prescriptions for Michael's sister Janet 
Jackson leading to his 2009 reprimand by the Medical Board of 
California.

Last fall he testified in Dr Conrad Murray's trial that Michael had come to him requesting Propofol, the drug that ended his life. Metzger said he refused Michale's request and warned him of the consequences, aiding prosecutors despite being a defense witness.

Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for the June 2009 
propofol overdose death of Jackson at age 50.

According
to Radar Online, Metzger was called on specifically by brothers 
Jermaine and Randy Jackson to treat their mother last week.

Metzger is not Katherine Jackson's primary physician and her regular doctor 
wasn't aware of his house call until concerns about Katherine Jackson's 
whereabouts were raised, Jackson’s lawyer, Sandra  Ribera said.

A phone message left for Metzger at his Beverly Hills practice was not 
immediately returned Sunday.

Earlier in the weekend he had said his mother was in Arizona resting 'on the orders of a doctor, not us,' where he reported himself being too.

He reports his mother having suffered 'a mini-stroke some months ago.

Doctor's orders: Dr. Allan Metzger, Michael Jackson's former physician, is seen last October during the Dr. Conrad Murray involuntary manslaughter trial. He's reported to be currently caring for Katherine Jackson in Arizona

'She is fine now, but the timeline doesn't alter the fact it happened,' he tweeted.

Michael’s three children have lived with
their grandmother since their father's untimely death. Not speaking to them
for a week was unheard of, according to
Ribera.

According to Ribera, on July 15 Jackson left her Calabasas, California, home with her daughter Rebbie to attend a Jackson brothers concert in Albuquerque, New Mexico a few days later.

It was on July 14 Metzger examined her after being brought to her Calabasas home by someone close to the family, she said.

She had been scheduled to depart on an RV trip to the Southwest to watch her sons perform. The elder Jackson never made any of the shows and Metzger apparently told her not to take the trip, Ribera said.

When Paris has called her grandmother she has been told she cannot speak to her, Ribera said.

Ribera said that Jackson 'has never gone 24 hours without talking to her kids,' and added that she was concerned the 82-year-old was not safe.

The sheriff's homicide-missing persons unit was asked to investigate, Ribera confirmed.

Since Michael's death his net worth has skyrocketed more than the amount when he was alive.

According to Billboard, MJ Inc has made no less than $1 billion a year thanks to his record deal with Sony Music, which is extended until 2017, as well as his concern films.

Michael's family bands The Jacksons and the Jackson 5 have sold approximately 800,000 albums according to Nielsen Soundscan while his independent albums have sold 9 million units in the U.S. alone.

In 2009 he sold 24 million units outside the U.S.
