French President Francois Hollande has warned that diplomacy with Russia  'cannot go on forever' as world leaders prepare to meet Vladimir Putin to discuss and end to the war in Ukraine.

Speaking at a news conference in Paris this morning, Hollande said he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will go to Kiev this afternoon to produce a conflict-resolution deal that would be acceptable to all parties.

But he told journalists that while France and Berlin had chosen diplomacy rather than arming Kiev troops against the pro-Russian separatists, negotiations could not drag on indefinitely.

Earlier this morning US Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Kiev to join the talks, with Hollande and Merkel confirming they will be travelling on to continue the talks with Putin in Moscow tomorrow.

In a sign of the importance of the initiative, this will be Merkel's first trip to Moscow since the conflict in Ukraine broke out a year ago.

In a new push for peace in eastern Ukraine, the leaders of France and Germany this morning made the announcement that they were heading to Kiev and Moscow with a proposal to end the fighting.

The surprise move came as the U.S. edged toward offering Ukraine lethal military aid as part of a new deal to help protect the country's borders.

The flurry of high-level diplomacy aimed to end the resurgent fighting in eastern Ukraine that is threatening European security. France and Germany hoped this time they could come up with a peace deal that both Ukraine and Russia could agree to.

Kerry is already visiting Kiev and in Brussels, NATO prepared to boost its forces today in response to Ukraine's unrest and Russia's increased military forcefulness.

Fighting between Russia-backed separatists and government forces picked up in January after a month of relative calm, with more than 220 civilians killed in the past three weeks alone, according to the United Nations. 

The UN has sharply criticized both sides for indiscriminate shelling and called for a temporary truce.

At least three people were killed in overnight shelling in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, local officials said today, amid fierce fighting in several areas of eastern Ukraine.

Hollande said he and  Merkel would travel to Kiev today and then to Moscow tomorrow, with a proposal 'based on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.' 

'It will not be said that France and Germany together have not tried everything, undertaken everything, to preserve the peace,' Hollande said.

Merkel's spokesman Steffen Siebert said 'given the escalation of violence in the past days, the chancellor and President Hollande are intensifying their months-long efforts for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.'

In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that Putin, Merkel and Hollande will discuss 'what the three nations can do to help put a quick end to a civil war in southeastern Ukraine, which has exacerbated in recent days with mounting casualties.'

Kerry came to Ukraine to show support for its embattled government as the Obama administration weighs sending arms to Kiev to help it fight Russian-backed separatists. 

He brought $16.4 million in new U.S. humanitarian aid but the Ukrainian government is anxious to use the visit to reiterate its plea for lethal aid.

President Barack Obama has opposed the idea of sending weapons to Ukraine but sources in his administration say this position could change in the light of recent fighting.

Officials with Kerry said he would discuss those needs with Ukrainian officials as well as new initiatives to resurrect a moribund cease-fire and resume a political dialogue to end the conflict.

Germany remains fiercely opposed to sending arms to Ukraine, a position that German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier reiterated today. 

Speaking after meeting with his Latvian counterpart, Edgars Rinkevics, in Riga, Steinmeier said it would not improve the situation if 'we now bring more weapons to the region.'

'We believe that we must make another attempt to finally bring the violence to an end,' he said, according to the DPA news agency.

In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the defense ministers meeting today are expected to approve boosting the size of the alliance's Response Force from 13,000 to 30,000, in reaction to Russian actions in Ukraine.

The diplomatic push to end the conflict, which has killed more than 5,000 people since last April, comes amid intensified fighting 

The Kremlin acknowledged that Russian volunteers are fighting in eastern Ukraine but insists that Moscow has not sent its troops or weapons to help the rebels.

Russia has expressed concerned about NATO's buildup in eastern Europe while defending a heavy military presence at its border with Ukraine.

Hollande appeared to be offering a nod to Putin on one of his key demands: that Ukraine stay out of NATO.

'France is not favorable to Ukraine's entry into NATO, let us be clear,' Hollande said today.

 'We have to speak the truth to all the countries that are around us. ... For the Russians who are worried ... We have to settle this problem among Europeans. We are on the same continent.'

The news comes as EU leaders are expected to consider punishing new economic sanctions against Moscow next week, and as Germany hosts world leaders at a security conference over the weekend at which Ukraine is expected to be the main subject. 

Britain has confirmed it will make 1,000 troops available to a rapid reaction force in the Baltic.

The creation of a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force to bolster the security of the alliance's eastern flanks was agreed when its leaders met for a summit in Wales last year.

It will be on standby to deploy up to 5,000 troops within two to five days in the event of a new crisis to provide reassurance to allies who fear they could be the next targets of aggression from neighbouring Russia.

UK armed forces will take the rotating lead role of the force in 2017.

The RAF will also continue the deployment of four RAF Typhoon jets to upgraded airspace patrols over Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the sustained fighting in Ukraine and Russia's continued arming and training of rebel forces was one of the greatest security challenges facing the world.

It was vital, he said ahead of the gathering in Brussels attended by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, to 'make clear that Nato is determined to defend all Allies against any threats from any direction'.

Mr Fallon said the UK would provide manpower to two regional headquarters - in Poland and Romania - and to force integration units in those countries as well as the three Baltic States and Bulgaria.

'Nato's credibility in the face of the security challenges we face depends on everyone playing their part to implement the decisions taken at Wales last year,' he said.

'The Readiness Action Plan demonstrates the Alliance's commitment to reinforce our collective defence but strong words must be backed up with firm action.

'That is why I am delighted to announce that the UK will lead the VJTF in 2017 and contribute to the Baltic Air Policing mission again in order to put the Plan into practice.'

Around 3,500 military personnel are also taking part in a series of Nato exercises ths year intended to ensure a persistent alliance presence in the region while providing further financial assistance to the government in Kiev.
