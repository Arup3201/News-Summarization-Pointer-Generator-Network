Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas is related to former Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, it has been claimed.

The
 dancer and socialite, 25, has been revealed as the war time 
leader's first cousin three times removed as research shows her maternal
 second great grandmother, Lady Georgiana Spencer-Churchill, was Winston
 Churchill's aunt.

Miss 
Bonas' aristocratic roots are well-documented, with a large 
number of senior politicians in her family tree, but this is believed to
 be the first time she has been directly linked to Churchill.

Good company: Cressida Bonas' maternal second great grandmother, Lady Georgiana Spencer-Churchill, was Winston Churchill's aunt. Miss Bonas is believed to have been in a relationship with Prince Harry since 2012

Great: Sir Winston Churchill was Prime Minister from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century

As well as Britain's cigar-smoking 
leading during the Second World War, Miss Bonas is directly related to 
the famous Dukes of Marlborough, who can trace their aristocratic roots 
back to Winston Churchill's heroic Royalist namesake during the English 
Civil War.

She is also 
directly related to William Cosby, who was made the Royal Governor of 
New Jersey and New York by George II in 1732, according to The Sun.

Another relative is Augustus Henry FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, who was Prime Minister for 15 years from 1768.

Miss Bonas' is also famously the great-granddaughter of
 Francis Curzon, 5th Earl Howe - the aristocratic racing driver who won 
the 1931 Le Mans 24-hour race.

'You'd
 expect Prince Harry to keep good company and Cressida Bonas is no 
exception,' a spokesman for Ancestry.co.uk told the newspaper.

'With
 everything from Prime Ministers to colonial governors in her bloodline,
 she shouldn't feel too out of place in the palace should Harry pop the 
question,' they added.

Miss 
Bonas accompanied Prince Harry on an official engagement for the first 
time last week, prompting speculation the couple may be about to get 
engaged.

Family tree: Cressida Bonas in related to Sir Winston Churchill via their mutual ancestor - Lady Georgiana Elizabeth Spencer-Churchill. This makes them first cousins, three times removed

Affection: Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas at Wembley. The Prince is expected to take his girlfriend to the Queen's estate in Balmoral this summer - a rite of passage for any royal bride-to-be

Ancestry: Cressida Bonas is also related to the Dukes of Marlborough, including the famous soldier and statesman John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (pictured) who died in 1722

Prince Harry is 
also rumoured to be thinking of taking Miss Bonas with him to Balmoral 
this summer for what is likely to be her first formal meeting with the 
Queen.

Visits to the Queenâ€™s 49,000-acre Scottish home are a rite of passage for any royal bride-to-be.

Catherine
 Middleton and her parents were invited to join Prince William on a 
private shooting party at Balmoral in October 2010, with their 
engagement announced the following month.

Last October, it was reported that Miss Bonas had overcome reservations about marrying into the Royal Family.

Prince
 Harry turns 30 in September and many of his closest friends are now 
married or engaged, which has increased public interest in his 
relationship with Miss Bonas.
