What does Rosetta’s comet really look like?

While it was known to be a particular shade of grey, what exactly it would look to the human eye has been a bit of a mystery.

But now the first colour image of the comet has revealed its true nature - and it turns out it's a slightly different, but somewhat similar, shade of grey to previous images.

The Max Planck Institute in Germany has revealed the true colour of 67P (shown). The image reveals what the comet would look like to the human eye. It was taken by combining different filters from Rosetta's main camera. Superposing the red, blue and green wavelengths together revealed the colour of the comet

The image was released by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Göttingen, Germany.

It was created using the Osiris camera on Rosetta, which is the primary camera on the spacecraft.

The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P.

It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014.

After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet.

But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet.

This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude.

Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet.

The scientists combined the instrument’s red, green and blue filters to create an image as it would appear to the human eye.

One of the most interesting findings from the image is that there is no sign of surface ice at all.

If it were present, it would be recognisable as a bluish feature on the surface - but as it is not, it must mean the comet’s ice is hidden beneath the surface.

‘We like to refer to Osiris as the eyes of Rosetta,’ said the instrument’s Principal Investigator Dr Holger Sierks from MPS.

‘However, these eyes are quite unlike our own.’

The camera has several colour filters that allow light of only certain wavelengths to pass through.

But usually, for scientific purposes, only one of the filters is used for images as by themselves the separate images are better than those with all wavelengths.

Thus creating a ‘true colour’ image is something that, while interesting, is not entirely useful for the mission as a whole.

The method to create the true colour image was similar to the way colours are combined in computer and TV monitors. 

Previous images of the comet, such as this one from 17 November 2014, had been taken using only one of the filters on the camera, so they had edited to appear in just black and white. The latest image, though, shows that the actual shade of the comet is not too different from these earlier photos

Previous speculation had suggested the comet might actually be red (shown), but as it turns out this was just one image taken by one of the three filters on Rosetta. Interestingly, though, the comet does actually reflect more red light than any other wavelength - like many other small bodies in the solar system

The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit (illustrated) in August 2014.

Each of the images also needs to be carefully superposed with the others, as Osiris takes the images one after the other.

This means that they each get a slightly different view of the comet, as Rosetta is travelling through space and the comet is rotating.

According to Emily Baldwin on Esa's Rosetta blog, this is the reason it had taken so long to get the first colour image of the comet.

'Painstaking work is needed to superimpose the images accurately, which is one reason it has taken so long to come up with the first meaningful colour image of 67P/C-G,' she wrote.

And the result? ‘As it turns out, 67P looks dark grey, in reality almost as black as coal,’ said Dr Sierks.

It has also been found that, due to the size of surface grains on the comet, it reflects red light slightly more efficiently than other wavelengths.

This is a phenomenon found on other small bodies in the solar system as well.

And from the images it appears there is no ice at all on the surface

This suggests it is all being hidden under the surface of the comet
