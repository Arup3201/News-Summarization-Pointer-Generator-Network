A mother-of-two has said a father accused of killing his six children in a house fire rubbed his hands together and told people he had a plan to win a custody battle against his former mistress.

Charlotte Bright told jurors at Nottingham Crown Court that Mick Philpott had told people that he had a plan to get his children back after his mistress Lisa Willis took them with her when she left the home he shared with his wife Mairead in Victory Road, Derby.

Jurors have heard that on the day of the fatal house fire that claimed the lives of his and Mairead Philpott's six children last May, Philpott was due to attend a custody hearing over the four children he shared with Miss Willis and a fifth she had from a previous relationship.

'Plan': Charlotte Bright told jurors Mick Philpott, seen left in a court sketch alongside Mairead Philpott and third defendant Paul Mosley, he had a plan to win a custody battle against his former mistress

It is alleged that Philpott and his 
wife, along with a third defendant Paul Mosley, started the fatal blaze 
at their home in Victory Road in order to frame Miss Willis as the 
culprit.

Today Ms 
Bright told Nottingham Crown Court that in the days leading up to the 
fire Philpott said to parents at the school gates: 'I've got a plan. 
I've got something up my sleeve. She's not getting those kids.'

Philpott also told Ms Bright he had received death threats from Miss Willis after she left their relationship.

Giving
evidence Ms Bright told jurors: 'I'm not sure whether it was in a phone
call or text but he said it said "We are going to bomb you or your 
house - I believe it was aimed at Mairead".'

Another
parent Denise Beck told the court: 'He said he wasn't going to let Lisa
get away with it - he had something up his sleeve - watch this space.'

Accused: Mick and Mairead Philpott are accused along with Paul Mosley of starting the blaze at their Allenton home

Referring
to the upcoming custody hearing, Ms Beck said: 'He was very confident 
about Friday. He said "I can't wait until Friday".'

The jury heard how Philpott had 'bragged and boasted' about the death threats he allegedly received from Miss Willis.

Neighbour Charlotte Harriot told the court Philpott appeared 'happy and hyper' when she visited him in the days leading up to the fire.

'He was all happy and hyper and bragging and boasting saying that Lisa had threatened to blow his house up. He was flashing his phone around and saying that he was going to see a solicitor,' she told the court.

She added: 'He was just happy that he had it on his phone that they were going to set fire to his house.'

Prosecuting Richard Latham QC asked Ms Harriot: 'Did you see his phone?' Miss Harriot replied: 'No.'

Cross examining, Mr Philpott's barrister Anthony Orchard QC asked her: 'I'm going to suggest the message said "leave me, my sister alone or I will kill you".'

Miss Harriot replied: 'No, he didn't tell me that.'

The court heard that the first police officer on the scene tried to gain entry to the house but the heat was too intense.

PC Amerjit Thandi said he was the first to arrive at the property after the 999 call was taken at 3.46am on May 11 last year.

He told the court he used a fire extinguisher to try to put the blaze out through a gap in the white UPVC front door but was driven back by the heat.

He said: 'The heat was intense, I could feel it in my face. I was probably around a foot away from the fire.'

He gained entry to the back garden of the house from the neighbour's property.

PC Thandi said he got into the conservatory and tried to get further into the house but was beaten back when he got as far as the kitchen door.

'I opened it (the kitchen door) slightly and I was hit by the heat of the flames,' he told the court.

The officer also said he climbed up a ladder propped up against the back of the house but came down when the fire crews arrived.

The jury heard that PC Thandi then went to the front of the house and saw three of the children on a plastic sheet who had been dragged from the burning house. The officer said he helped to provide CPR to one of them.

Philpott held his head in his hands and appeared visibly upset as Pc Thandi gave his evidence this afternoon.

The officer told the court he travelled with one of the children in the ambulance to the hospital. On arrival at A&E, he said he saw a security guard who was crying.

'He said he was godfather to one of the children.'

Mr Latham asked him: 'What name did he give?'

'Brian Mosley,' PC Thandi replied.

He said his brother, Paul Mosley, had been at the house the night before and he had called him to tell him the news about the fire.

When Paul Mosley arrived at the hospital, he told police he had left the Philpotts' house at 2am on May 11 and walked home.

Six siblings Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13 - all died after the fire which engulfed the Philpotts' home in Allenton in the early hours of Friday May 11 last year.

Philpott, 56, his 31-year-old wife and Mosley, 46, have all denied six counts of manslaughter in relation to their children's deaths.

The court has heard how Miss Willis lived with the couple as Philpott's mistress along with her four children that were fathered by him and another child she had from a previous relationship.

Miss Willis had left the house, taking her five children, after becoming fed up with the domestic situation, jurors have heard.

The trial continues.
