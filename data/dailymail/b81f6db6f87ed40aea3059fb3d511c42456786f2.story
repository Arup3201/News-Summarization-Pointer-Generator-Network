A newlywed who stole £100,000 from his employer so that his wife could go on a spending spree for a new car, motorbike and breast enhancement surgery has been jailed.

Arron Thomas, 32, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, wrote fraudulent cheques from building firm Grafton's and deposited them in his wife Rhianna's account, Oxford Crown Court heard.

Mrs Thomas, 24, then embarked on a series of extravagant purchases including £4,000 to have her breasts enlarged, £9,000 on a Suzuki motorbike and £14,000 on a Volvo C70 coupe.

Guilty: Arron Thomas stole £100,000 from a building firm and deposited in his wife Rhianna's account

In the midst of the fraud the couple also got married on April 29, 2011, the same day as Prince William and Kate Middleton.

But their lavish lifestyle soon attracted suspicion and in January last year they were arrested at their home and charged with a string of fraud-related offences.

Mr Thomas admitted his part in the fraud and was jailed at Oxford Crown Court today for 22 months.

Mrs Thomas denied charges of 
possessing and transferring criminal property but was found guilty by a jury on 
three counts following a trial.

She was cleared of four similar charges.

The court heard how Mr Thomas had orchestrated the fraud by writing false invoices while 
he worked as a purchase ledger clerk at building firm Grafton's.

Cheques were written out under the name 'Tucker', implying they were for intended for a supplier of that name.

In fact, they were paid into Rhianna Thomas' account under her maiden name, which was also 'Tucker'.

Money started to flow into her account 
and Mrs Thomas visited a Make Yourself Amazing (MYA) branch for cosmetic
surgery in a £4,250 pounds operation in Birmingham on February 20, 
2011.

A Suzuki motorbike was bought
and a Volvo was purchased from Johnsons Cars Limited in Oxford after 
Thomas traded in her eight-year-old old Rover MG ZT.

Mrs Thomas was handed a 15-month jail
sentence suspended for two years after the judge said she was 'under 
the spell' of her husband when she committed the crimes.

Sheilagh Davies, representing Mr Thomas, said: 'Prior to his employment at Graftons Mr Thomas had got himself into debt.

'He wanted the very best for Rhianna 
and so he borrowed an awful lot of money - £12,000 pounds initially, 
rising to £20,000 pounds.

'He had lost his job when the recession hit, but he wanted to recompense her for looking after him and his daughter.

'He bought her a car with the money. It was misguided and stupid as it was one of those loans with huge interest.

'In the end he turned to fraud and 
these are why these offences come about. He accepts what he did and he 
must be punished for it.'

Mr Thomas had several convictions for dishonesty stretching back to 2000 and was jailed for 90 days in February 2007.

Claire Fraser, representing Mrs Thomas said her client had no previous convictions.

She said: 'She was not charged with any fraud herself. At the beginning 
of the activities she did not know or suspect they were a criminal 
product of fraud.

'Had it not been for Aaron Thomas then Rhianna Thomas would not be where she stand today.'

A judge at Oxford Crown Court jailed Arron Thomas for 22 months after he admitted defrauding his former employer

Recorder Philip Brooke-Smith, 
addressing Mrs Thomas, said: 'The offences for which you have been 
convicted are very serious ones.

'You may have been under the spell of
your husband, that is not to say you were without a mind of your own, 
you are an intelligent person and probably remain so, however, you were 
and probably remain in love with your husband.

'Through that period you married him and I regard these matters as the background around you.'

Mrs Thomas dressed in a grey coat wept as her husband in a blue tee-shirt was led away to begin his jail term.

Speaking after the case, 
Investigating officer Detective Constable Matt Welsh, of Thames Valley 
Police, said: 'Arron Thomas embarked on this large-scale fraud just 
months after starting his new job and made little effort in covering up 
his crimes.

'His actions were blatant but he 
believed the fraud would go unnoticed. He couldn’t carry this fraud out 
on his own so he involved Rhianna, who was well-aware the money was 
stolen.

'The couple enjoyed a lavish 
lifestyle, spending just under £100,000 in just three months on 
expensive goods such as cars, motorbikes, a luxury wedding and even 
cosmetic surgery.

'This lifestyle was a far cry from what they were used to which would have raised suspicions among those who knew them.

'I welcome the sentences and would like to thank all the witnesses and those who assisted with the police investigation.

'Proceedings will now take place to recover the property bought with stolen money and any other available assets.'
