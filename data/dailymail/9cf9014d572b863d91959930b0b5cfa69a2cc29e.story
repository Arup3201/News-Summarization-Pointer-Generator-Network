A 30-year-old man's break up text to his girlfriend of two months has gone viral after he listed six reasons why they should stop dating.

The man, whose name appears to be 'Bobo', claimed that the Sydney woman was 'rude to my cat and that makes me uncomfortable'.

He was also unimpressed by her habitual use of foul language, saying: 'Your swearing is unladylike'.

But the woman, who remains unidentified, seems to have already mended her heartbreak, telling Ninemsn the message sent last week was 'a bit laughable'.

A 30-year-old man's break up text to his girlfriend of two months has gone viral after he listed six reasons why they should stop dating

The man sent the text last Monday just before his then partner, a Sydney woman, was to attend a friend's wedding without him

The man sent the text last Monday just before his then partner had planned a weekend away to attend a friend's wedding without him.

'He'd indicated that he was upset he couldn't attend with me but we were only very casual as far as I was concerned and the guest list had been finalised months ago, there wasn't necessarily an option to take a plus one,'  the woman told Ninemsn.

The pair met at a pub and the woman became romantically involved with Bobo as she thought he was a decent guy - unlike others she had previously dated.

But when she received the break up text last week, she sent it to her friend Amy Nelmes who then shared it on social media the message which gained more than 17,000 retweets.

The anonymous woman says she was amused by the text message and said she abstained from sending a vile response.

She also defended her dislike for cats as she is allergic to them.

'On the nights I would sleep over, the cat would want to up at the end of the bed, but I had to insist that it was locked out while I was there,' she said. 

And it appears that she's put off the domesticated felines for life as she vows to never again date man with a pet cat.
