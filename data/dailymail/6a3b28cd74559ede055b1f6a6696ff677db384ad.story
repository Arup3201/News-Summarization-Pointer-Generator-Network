These curious living trees have fused together into bizarre contortions both by accident and design.

Thanks to bean farmer Axel Erlandson from California, who pioneered the art of weaving and pruning trees together, we have the basket-shaped and arch-shaped trees from his collection of 'circus trees'.

The rest occur naturally in a phenomenon known as inosculation, when one tree bonds to another.

Axel Erlandson sculpted this single tree into an arch design in a secret method that had not yet been replicated

The Basket Tree, one of Erlandson's rare circus trees, was woven together from six separate sycamore trees

Taking many years to gently shape, graft and prune the trees, Erlandson created the odd trees, starting with his 'Four Legged Giant' creation - four trees which he grew into a single truck creating a gazebo effect in the middle.

The basket effect tree required 42 separate connections between six sycamore trees in a secret configuration that no one else has yet been able to replicate.

Erlandson started off the sculptures as a way to entertain his family but by the time of his death, he had a collection of 74 of these circus trees.

He was inspired by nature as he noticed the elegance of trees weaving together on his farm.

Some trees are capable of creating unintentional art without any help from horticulturalists

Of the planet's 400 odd billion trees, these are some of the most unusual and exotic

They may look surreal but these trees are living and natural

The trees were bought by millionaire 
Michael Bonfante, who transplanted them from the Santa Cruz mountains to
his amusement park Gillroy Gardens in 1985, where they are still on 
display.

Other quirky examples of tree sculpture occur naturally as trunks contort due to extreme weather conditions or to fit round obstacles.Â 

Given time trees can grow around just about anything, as seen in ruins around the world such as Angkor Wat, where trees have pushed through the foundations of the buildings.
