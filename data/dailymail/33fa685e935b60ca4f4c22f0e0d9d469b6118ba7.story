A hero soldier was shot twelve times as he tried to charge down an army officer who launched a shooting rampage at his base killing thirteen people, a court martial heard today.

Another victim of accused shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan was pregnant when she was gunned down by the Muslim psychiatrist who also inured 30 people when he opened fire in a crowded medical building at Fort Hood Texas in 2009.

Spc. Frederick Greene was shot 12 times during the attack, Lt. Col. Phillip Berran told the judge after reviewing photos of the soldier’s body before jurors were led into the courtroom at Fort Hood. When asked by a prosecutor if his findings were consistent with Greene 'charging the shooter,' the pathologist responded: 'Yes, it is.'

Hero: Spc. Frederick Greene was shot 12 times as he courageously charged Hasan during the 2009 Fort Hood shooting

Evil: Nidal Hasan wants to become a martyr after killing 13 people - including a pregnant woman - during the shooting

Prosecutors chose not to introduce the photos as evidence.

Greene, who was married with two children, was known around the base as the 'Silent Soldier' because of his mellow demeanor, according to Fox News.

The 29-year-old was active at Baker's Gap Baptist Church in his hometown of Mountain City, Tennessee, while he was growing up, according to Glenn Arney, the church's former superintendent and a former co-worker.

Greene's family issued a statement shortly after his death that said, ‘Fred was a loved and loving son, husband and father, and often acted as the protector of his family.

‘Even before joining the Army, he exemplified the Army values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage. Many of his fellow soldiers told us he was the quiet professional of the unit, never complaining about a job, and often volunteering when needed.’

The Army newspaper Stars and Stripes reported that Greene was struck so many times that it was difficult to determine the path the bullets took, and the pathologist had to use a metal rod to determine the trajectory.

Another victim, Pvt. Francheska Velez, was shot once by a bullet that fractured her rib and went through her heart and right lung — a wound that wasn’t survivable, said pathologist Col. AbuBakr Marzouk.

When asked if the 21-year-old Chicago woman had any other significant medical conditions, Marzouk replied: 'She was pregnant.'

Witnesses testified earlier in the trial that they would hear Velez crying out, 'My baby! My baby!' during the shootings.

Berran also described how Pfc. Aaron Nemelka, 19, who was struck three times, was likely shot while lying on the ground. That means at least five victims were killed while lying down, according to testimony from several pathologists this week.

Martyr: Hasan's attorneys feel he's trying to sabotage his case so he gets the death penalty and becomes a martyr

Berran told Hasan's court-martial that Nemelka, the youngest of the massacre victims, suffered intensely as his organs filled with blood.

It was 'not an immediately fatal wound,' Berran said.

Retired Major Clifford Hopewell, who was Chief of Traumatic Brain Injury and worked in a building near to where Hasan opened fire, testified Thursday that he ran out of his office when he heard the thunder of bullets and people screaming.

He said he saw bodies strewn outside the building, scooped up a fallen magazine cartridge, and later encountered his psychiatrist colleague, Hasan.

'He was laying prone on the ground and he wasn't moving ... I thought he was dead,' said Clifford, who was the first person to officially identify him to authorities.

Hasan — who is acting as his own attorney — raised no objections and didn’t question any of the witnesses Thursday, which has largely been his strategy since the trial began last week.

The Army psychiatrist’s lack of defense so far has allowed prosecutors to call more than 70 witnesses, indicating that the trial could wrap up far sooner than the months-long timeline originally announced by the judge.

The military defense attorneys who have been ordered to help Hasan during the trial have accused Hasan of trying to convince jurors to convict him and sentence him to death. Hasan has disputed those claims, calling them a twist of the facts.

Victim: These are the 13 people killed during the attack. Private Velez was pregnant and was heard screaming 'my baby! My baby!'

But he recently authorized the release of a report that shows he told military mental health experts after the attack that he 'would still be a martyr' if he were convicted and executed by the government.

The report was released by Hasan’s civil attorney to the New York Times, which posted it online, but prosecutors were ordered by the judge not to read it.

The military Judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, ended court earlier than planned Thursday because Hasan told her he had been sitting upright since he woke up at 4am. He has to adjust himself frequently.

If convicted, Hasan could face the death penalty. The 13-member jury of officers must unanimously find Hasan guilty of premeditated murder for him to be executed. The U.S. military has not executed a service member since 1961.
