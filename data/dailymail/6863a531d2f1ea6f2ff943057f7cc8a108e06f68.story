Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion.

Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there’s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone.

The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their iPad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots.

The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (£16), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon.

The set comes with an attachment head for the tablet, a reinforced selfie stick and a remote control.

Users can deploy it to see themselves in more detail as they are taking a snap, or to make it easier to include themselves in large groups pictures.

The head comprises an adjustable rubber clamp that the company  claims can hold all sizes of tablets and smartphones securely.

‘The durable selfie stick is built strong, so your tablet or phone will be safe and secured in the air when you are taking a selfie,’ the website says.

For $23 (£16), budding photographers get an attachment head for their tablet, a selfie stick and a remote control. As well as taking close-ups, users could make use of the stick to include impressive views or large groups of people in their shots (some examples are shown above)

On the end of a strap is a standard quarter-inch (0.5cm) mount into which the stick itself can be attached.

It extends up to 3ft (1m) to 'give your device the best photo taking coverage.'

However, the tablet may appear heavier when it's held away from the body and could be difficult to keep still, so not to take blurry photos.

The company says of its bundle: 'No matter where you may be, you are sure to get everyone and neighbouring surroundings in the picture'.

In order to help users hold the stick still, there's a Bluetooth remote control that comes with the bundle to make taking pictures slightly easier, without the need of setting timers.

It’s compatible with iPhone and Android handsets.

Customers can also buy the strap on its own for $10 (£7), but run the risk of using it with an insufficiently strengthened stick, which could end in an expensive accident. 

Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them.

This week organisers of two major US festivals have made clear what they think of selfie sticks.

The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds.

While the latter has named 'GoPro attachments like sticks, selfie sticks & monopods' on its list of prohibited items, Coachella has banned festivalgoers from bringing 'Selfie sticks/Narsisstics (sic)'.

However, it remains unclear how organizers intend to identify and weed out 'narsisstics' at the gates of the festival, which begins in Indio, California on April 10 - more than three months before Lollapalooza.

And selfie sticks are not the only unusual items to be banned at the two festivals. Coachella also prohibits blankets, chairs, flags, hula hoops, marker pens, stuffed animals and umbrellas on its list .

The ban, first reported by Brooklyn Vegan , will prevent selfie sticks from obstructing festivalgoers' views of the stage - and could limit the illegal recording of performances, according to Rolling Stone .

It will likely mean attendees will have to resort to the old-fashioned method of using their arms to take selfies.

Selfie sticks, which allow users to position their smartphone or camera beyond the normal range of their arm, have already been banned from an array of venues and historical sites across the world.

According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have prohibited them, while CBC reports that France's Palace of Versailles and Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.
