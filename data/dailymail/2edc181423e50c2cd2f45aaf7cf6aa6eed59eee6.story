In trouble: George Zimmerman was granted bail on Tuesday following his Monday arrest from a domestic dispute

George Zimmerman has been released from jail after posting $9,000 bail - but not before his wife Shellie served him with divorce papers while he was behind bars.

Zimmerman, who was arrested Monday after his girlfriend Samantha Scheibe called 911 saying that he threatened her with a double-barrel shotgun, has been dodging his estranged wife's attempts to legally notify him that she wants a divorce.

Until Zimmerman got the divorce papers, a judge refused to proceed with the divorce case.

Zimmerman, who was acquitted this summer of murdering teenager Trayvon Martin, is 'millions' of dollars in debt and relying on public defenders for his legal team, his attorney revealed.

TMZ.com reports that Shellie Zimmerman has been trying to divorce George since September - but she can't because court agents have not been able to track him down and hand him the paperwork formally notifying him of the divorce.

He finally got the paperwork today in the Seminole County jail.

Zimmerman was seen for the first time since on Tuesday when his two new lawyers accompanied him to the first appearance hearing where a judge heard arguments over whether or not he should be released on bail while waiting for his charges to be brought to court on January 7. 

The judge ordered that he will be 
allowed to be released but he must not contact Ms Scheibe and stay away 
from two specified residences - one of which is her home.

Leaving: Shellie Zimmerman has been trying to divorce her husband since September - but couldn't proceed because he wouldn't be served with the court papers. She is seen here at her husband's murder trail this summer

Out on bail: Zimmerman will not be allowed to speak to his girlfriend, go near her house, leave the state of Florida or possess any of his weapons until after his trial on January 7

In 
addition, the judge explained that he was assigning the $9,000 bail bond
by valuing the aggravated assault charge at $8,900 and $100 for each of
the misdemeanor charges of battery and criminal mischief that he faces.

He will also have to remain in the state of Florida, wear an ankle monitoring bracelet, and surrender any and all weapons.

His
attorneys, who were state-appointed due to his lack of funds, said that
those conditions would be fine and he has already turned his guns over 
to the sheriff's office.

Both
of the attorneys who were at the Tuesday hearing with Mr Zimmerman work
in the public defender's office and they said in a press conference 
that in a signed affidavit the former neighborhood watchman swore that 
his liabilities outweighed his income. 

Some reports place the liabilities at higher than $2million but attorney Daniel Megaro would not confirm that number as he said he has not yet looked over the affidavit.

Zimmerman kept his responses short during the court appearance, saying that he did understand the charges and conditions of his bond.

The district attorney who is arguing the case against Mr Zimmerman revealed that Ms Scheibe claimed he tried to choke her more than a week ago but she never reported it.

'They had been discussing breaking up,' the attorney said when she explained the choking incident.

Ms Scheibe also reportedly said that Mr Zimmerman had been discussing suicide saying that he 'had nothing to lose'.

His attorney, Mr Megaro, addressed the accusation during the press conference after the court appearance, saying that he did not get the impression that Mr Zimmerman was suicidal.

'I definitely would not characterize my client as a loose cannon,' he said.

The Monday arrest came after Ms Scheibe made a hysterical 911 call at 12.30pm, where she is heard saying: 'You put your gun in my freakin' face... Get out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please get out of my house.'

A
hysterical 911 call made by George Zimmerman's girlfriend today has 
been made public, where she claims that he pointed a shotgun at her 
face.

Samantha Scheibe 
called for help at 12.30pm on Monday outside of her home in Apopka, 
Florida, claiming that Zimmerman had locked her outside and was smashing
up furniture.

At one 
point during the call, Miss Scheibe screamed at Zimmerman: 'You put your
gun in my freakin' face... Get out of my house. Do not push me out of 
my house. Please get out of my house.'

Scheibe said that Zimmerman had 
smashed a glass table, threatened her with the shotgun and ultimately 
pushed her out of the house, according to an arrest report.

After
pushing her out, Zimmerman barricaded the door with furniture and 
refused to leave, saying that he would talk to police by phone, 
authorities said.

Scheibe 
told the dispatcher: 'You kidding me? He pushed me out of my house and 
locked me out. ... He knows how to do this. He knows how to play this 
game.'

Moments later, Zimmerman called 911 from inside the barricaded house to tell his side of the story.

'I have a girlfriend, who for lack of a better word, has gone crazy on me,' Zimmerman said.

Zimmerman
then said he never pulled a gun on his girlfriend, and that it was 
Scheibe who smashed a table at the home they shared.

He
also told the dispatcher that Scheibe was pregnant with their child and
that she had decided she would raise the child on her own. When 
Zimmerman started to leave, 'she got mad,' he said.

Scene: Zimmerman was arrested at his girlfriend's home on Monday afternoon, and his relatives told a local paper that he had been living at that residence for a few weeks

Seminole County Sheriff's Office Deputy Chief Dennis Lemma said at a news conference that Scheibe wasn't pregnant.

Deputies
used a key provided by Scheibe to unlock the door and they were able to
push through the barricade of items, Lemma said.

'She was very concerned for her own safety especially having the weapon pointed at her and then being pushed out,' he said.

Lemma says Zimmerman was compliant and unarmed when deputies came to the house.
