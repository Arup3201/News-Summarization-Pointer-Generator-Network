Carlos the Jackal is to go on trial for a grenade attack in the heart of tourist Paris – 40 years after it happened. 

Anti-terrorist judges in the French capital today ruled that the Venezuelan killer, whose real name is Carlos Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, must face justice for the September 1974 atrocity.

Two men died and 34 others, including four children, were seriously injured in the attack on the Publicis Drugstore in the upmarket St-Germain-des-pres area, on the city's Left Bank.

In 2011 Sanchez was found guilty over a series of bombings which killed 11 people and maimed dozens

Sanchez is currently serving two life sentences in a high security French jail for numerous crimes carried out in the 1970s and 80s.

At his last trial, in 2011, he was found guilty over a series of bombings which killed 11 people and maimed dozens of others.

Judges ruled Sanchez should serve a second life sentence 'with no possibility of parole for 18 years'.

Now a legal source close to the case has confirmed that Sanchez would go on trial in the 'coming months' over the grenade attack.

Francoise Rudetzki, founder of a victims' rights group which campaigns for those whose lives have been devastated by terrorist acts, said the news of Sanchz's trial was 'met with great satisfaction' from those who had survived it.  

Sanchez has always been a suspect in the attack at the drug store on the Boulevard Saint-Germain, but has denied involvement.

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the murders, which investigators believe Sanchez carried out as a ‘freelance’ terrorist.

Sanchez had argued that all of the atrocities he committed were on behalf of 'decent' political causes, including 'Marxist revolution' and 'Palestinian liberation'.

But, at his last trial, prosecutor Olivier Bray said Sanchez was in fact a profit-motivated criminal who always aimed to 'kill the maximum number of people with the minimum of risk'. 

Prosecutors said all of Sanchez's attacks were carried out as part of a campaign to force the authorities to release two of his accomplices, including Magdalena Kopp, whom he went on to marry.

The court heard how a letter carrying Sanchez's fingerprints had been received by the then French government threatening 'war' if the pair were not released within 30 days.

Sanchez became infamous in 1975 when his commando group took numerous hostages from a meeting of the OPEC oil organisation in Vienna.
