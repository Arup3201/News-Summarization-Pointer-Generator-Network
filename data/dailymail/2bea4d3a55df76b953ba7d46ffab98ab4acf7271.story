Mischa Barton may be under under threat of foreclosure, but her father Paul isn’t worried.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Paul Barton said of his daughter's mortgage issues, 'I'm not worried about it. It's not a big sum of money. Deutsche Bank doesn't seem to be bothered by it, so I'm not.'

The former O.C. starlet, now 28,  could lose her $7.1 million Beverly Hills estate if she doesn't pay the $100k in back mortgage payments she owes, according to TMZ.Scroll down for video

Vape vamp: Mischa Barton's father is not worried about his daughter losing her home. She's got a trendy London boutque, a bunch of films in the works and she's just been named as the lead judge of VAPESTICK Style Icon, a UK campaign to find the county's most stylish e-cig vaper

'I actually didn't know she was behind [in her mortgage payments]. Mischa will pay it. I'm not concerned, really,' says dad Paul, who took up full time residency in his daughter's home with wife Nuala in 2009 when the couple attempted an intervention.

Mischa threatened suicide while under the influence of a sedative which landed her in the same psychiatric ward as Britney Spears -- Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was placed under an involuntary 5150 hold for three days after she threatened to end her life.

Coincidentally enough, Mischa's mansion sits across the street from Britney's former Summit estate.

'Mischa lives in London now. She hasn't been here in weeks. There's only the two of us living here and it's 10,000 square feet. We'd like to sell the house. We love it here, but let's be real, it's a little big.'

Property records show the hilltop home,  behind the prestigious gated Bowmont Estates, has eight bedrooms,11 bathrooms, and boasts sprawling views from downtown L.A. to the Pacific Coast's Catalina Island.

'She'll do it. She's just a little behind, that's all,' Paul added.

Barton hit her Hollywood peak in the mid-2000s, starring as the sexy Marissa Cooper in 76 episodes of The O.C. After her 2007 D.U.I. arrest and the mental ward hold two years later, Mischa switched gears into fashion with her own line of handbags, cosmetics and clothes. Her London shop, Mischa's Place, sits on in the trendy Spitalfields Market on Brushfield Street.

When asked about his daughter's current life outside of Hollywood, Paul said, "' don't know what my daughter does. She dates a lot of people. She's always working and traveling to buy items for her shop. She's a grown woman. I don't have to keep tabs on her.'

After her flicker of fame began to fade following the cancellation The O.C. due to poor ratings, Mischa re-tooled her career, taking on several smaller roles on TV and in film.

Mischa has a whopping 17 projects in development, and seven films currently in production. She made 17 films since 2007, with none grossing more than $38 million.

Mischa, who told the British Metro newspaper that she wasn't as grateful for her involvement in the TV hit as she should be, will also head up a nationwide campaign to find Britain's most stylish vaper for e-cigarette brand VAPESTICK.

The new pictures of the interior of the eight bedroom pad show Barton's tastes, with the master bedroom featuring blue walls, green draped curtains and mustard coloured linen on the four poster bed.

The 7,607-square-foot Spanish-style gated home has views of Catalina Island, according to Zillow.

It also features 11 bathrooms and a nearly 3,000 square foot guesthouse.

Barton seems fond of retro style furniture, with the dining room dotted with vintage chairs on a black and white checked floor teamed with orange coloured walls and a chandelier.

Grecian style white stone columns sit beneath the large wooden dining table, while velvet drapes and overhead spotlights finish the room.

The carpeted lounge has a more cosy feel with several beige coloured couches alongside bright citrus cushions and yellow walls, combined with Barton's favourite matching drapes.

The kitchen is also painted buttercup yellow, with wooden beans across the ceiling teamed with a wrought iron chandelier, a country style tiled floor and varnished wooden units.

A larder with artfully distressed white wooden units are full of the slim actress's favourite foods including organic vegetable broth and tinned fruit.

The exterior of the home is no less opulent, with a large rectangular swimming pool sitting alongside beautiful bougainvillea, an immaculate lawn and patio area.

And the outer stone wall of the two storey main house is covered with ivy.

However, the actress is apparently struggling to keep up with her mortgage payments, according to TMZ.

The website claims to have obtained the default notice that indicates she's 
'skipped more than $100 grand in payments' thereby commencing the 
foreclosure process.

The lavish pad, which sits on 1.2 
acres was purchased for $6.4 million in 2005 - where real estate was
 at its height.

According to the entertainment site, The Sixth Sense star took out a loan for $4.2 million at the time of sale.

But
 since then, she's been trying to unload the property for several years,
 having listed it for $8.695 million in 2010 and then again in 2011.

Mischa
 couldn't find any interested parties to purchase the sprawling 
residence so she tried leasing it for $35K a month, reported TMZ.

Since The O.C. went off the air in 2007, Barton has starred in a slew of low budget films.

The actress has seven films waiting to be released including Zombie Killers: Elephant's Graveyard with Titanic star Billy Zane and the comedy American Beach House with Lorenzo Lamas.

She's currently shooting the thriller Checkmate with Danny Glover, Sean Astin and Vinnie Jones.

Once that is completed, the London-born actress has four more films ready to go including Phantasmagoria: The Movie with Kyle XY star Matt Dallas.

And in case all of her various acting endeavours don't generate enough income, she also has her own clothing store in London called Mischa Barton Boutique London.
