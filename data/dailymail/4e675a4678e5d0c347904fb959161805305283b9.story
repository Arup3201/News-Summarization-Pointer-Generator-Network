It would mean no last-minute scramble to rush for the train to work in the mornings.

But the owner of this house might have to put up with train passengers peeking through their window.

Commuters have been given the chance to buy the house of their dreams - on the platform of a busy train station.

It could be just the ticket for the lucky buyer who will be able to open their back door and walk straight onto their morning train to work at the unmanned station.

Beat the commute: The lucky buyer will be able to open their back door and walk straight onto their morning train to work

The train station which is up for sale in the town of Pemmaenmawr, near Bangor, North Wales and has views of the sea

Meet the neighbours! The Grade II-listed Victorian railway station house will be surrounded by commuters in the morning

The Grade II-listed Victorian railway station house sits on the main London to North Wales line where more than 20 trains stop every day.

But the new purchaser is guaranteed at least six hour's undisturbed sleep - no trains run between midnight and 6am.

Estate agent Hugh Steele-Perkins said: 'It is a commuter's dream house - you can step out of your bedroom and immediately be on the train.

'There's even a small window in the side of the property so you can see trains coming down the tracks.

'Just think - no more waiting on the platform on cold and wintery mornings.'

The house in the seaside town of Penmaenmawr, near Bangor, North Wales, is a three-and-a-half hour commute from London.

The station house has been used as an antiques shop with a three-bedroomed flat on the top floor

The owner will be based in the pretty town of Penmaenmawr, near Bangor, North Wales

The distinctive property, which is built of heavy granite, has 2,220 sq ft of floor space and two basement rooms

Penmaenmawr railway station serves the small town of and is located on the Crewe to Holyhead North Wales Coast Line. The station is a request stop.

The line was built between 1844 and 1850 by the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company.

It was of huge importance because in 1801, when the Act of Union was passed, all of Ireland became integrated with the United Kingdom.

As mail had been exchanged on horse drawn cart and boats, a train would provide a speedier service for communication between Ireland and the United Kingdom.

But whoever buys the Â£127,500 three-bedroomed house is going to be chuffed.

Mr Steele-Perkins, director at Jacksons Commercial, in Llandudno, said: 'It's a busy station because it's on the main Euston to Holyhead line.

'It also has wonderful sea views from the top floor.'

The station house which was built in 1850 has been used as an antiques shop with a three-bedroomed flat on the top floor since it was de-commissioned by British Rail in 1986.

The property - built of heavy granite - has 2220 sq ft of floor space, two basement rooms and the former ground floor station ticket office and waiting rooms.

Mr Steele-Perkins added: 'What the future holds for the station house is now in the hands of the buyer.

'With its history of mixed residential and commercial use, the possibilities would seem endless.'
