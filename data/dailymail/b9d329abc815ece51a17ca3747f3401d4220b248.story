A Tennessee man who was accused of using a racial slur on a receipt at a Red Lobster restaurant last year is suing the restaurant chain and the waitress who cashed in on the incident after she posted a copy of the receipt on the Internet.

Devin Barnes, 21, claims he never wrote the racial slur on the receipt, and that the negative attention he received as a result of the way Toni Christina Jenkins - the waitress who claims to have received the slur - publicized the incident is slanderous.Â 

In Barnes' suit, filed in Williamson County
 Circuit Court, he claims Jenkins slandered him by misusing his personal information, and that Red Lobster's 'willful and malicious ... omissions to act' by failing to prevent Jenkins 
from using his name and information 'to gain publicity and money' has caused lasting damage to his reputation.

Not guilty: Devin Barnes, 20, says he didn't write the n-word on his Red Lobster check and he's got a forensic expert's opinion to back him up

Bad tipper: A forensics expert compared the writing on the total line with a sample of both Mr Barnes and his wife's handwriting and ruled that there were no similarities

On the receipt, a photo of which was 
posted on Facebook and Youtube in September by the 19-year-old waitress,
 the line designated for a tip read 'none.' On the line for the total, 
it read 'n***er.'

Jenkins left a caption on the photo that was uploaded to her Facebook page that read 'This
 is what I got as a tip last night...so happy to live in the proud 
southern states...God Bless America, land of the free and home of the 
low class racists of Tennessee.'

Barnes' signature is visible in the photo directly below the offensive slur.

In
 the weeks following Jenkins' posting the photo on the web, the 
left-wing blog AddictingInfo.org started an online fundraiser for her 
that raised more than $10,000 - money Jenkins later said she planned to 
use to buy a car.

Barnes 
admits that he didn't tip Jenkins, but says he didn't tip her because 
the order was a takeout order - but he adamant that he never wrote the 
slurs on the receipt, and even hired a hand-writing analyst to take 
analyze the receipt.

Miss Jenkins served Mr Barnes and his wife last month at the Red Lobster location in Cool Springs, Tennessee

Trouble customers: Speaking last month with MailOnline, Miss Jenkins described Mr and Mrs Barnes as being very rude when she served them

Apology: Mr Barnes wrote a note saying he was sorry for the incident, but admitted that it wasn't him that wrote 'n*****' on the check

The handwriting analyst found that 'no significant handwriting 
characteristics similarities' were found between the questioned 'total' 
entry line and the handwriting samples provided by Barnes and his wife, the Tennessean reports.

Barnes
 even wrote a note to the waitress explaining that he never uses the 
'n-word' and that he has no idea how it ended up written on the receipt.

Speaking
 exclusively to MailOnline shortly after the incident, Jenkins said she 
believes Barnes when he says he didn't write the slur. She says she only
 posted the picture at all 'to make a comment about racism,' not to draw
 attention to herself.

'I
 know I didn't write it. If he's claiming he didn't write it, I believe 
him wholeheartedly. I'm just that kind of person. I have nothing against
 him or his family,' Miss Jenkins said.

After
 he began receiving negative attention online, Barnes says he turned to 
his pastor, Richard Dugger - who also is his attorney - and filed the 
suit against both the waitress and the restaurant chain.

After hearing that Mr Barnes denied writing the n-word on his check, Miss Jenkins said that she believes him wholeheartedly. She says she posted the check on her Facebook to make a statement about racism, not draw attention to herself

According
 to Duggar, Barnes and his family have been getting 'threats from all 
over the world,' and that the incident has caused his client 'great harm
 and mental anguish.'

'The
 plaintiff is not now, nor has he ever been, a "racist;" but now as a 
result of the defendant's acts and omissions to act, your plaintiff has 
been tagged a "racist" world wide,' the suit says.

The
 suit goes on to say that Jenkins exploited Barnes and purposefully 
dramatized the incident 'to a point that she profited from it.'

In all, AddictingInfo.org raised $10,719 in its 'Tips for Toni' campaign from more than 1,000 contributors across the globe.

Red
 Lobster, the suit claims, is equally responsible for the anguish Barnes
 claims he's suffered as a result of Jenkins' actions because it failed 
to take action against Jenkins and it did nothing to resolve the matter 
with Barnes.

'As we shared before, it is against our 
policy to post guest information online. Our standard procedure is to 
suspend the employee involved with pay while we determine what happened,' Red Lobster said in a statement issued Friday.
 'After the completion of a full investigation into this matter, Miss 
Jenkins returned to work. As we also shared, we were disgusted by the 
language used on this guest check as it has no place in our restaurant 
or anywhere else.'

Barnes is seeking $1 million in his suit against Jenkins and the restaurant.

Reward: In wake of the viral photo more than 1,000 people contributed to give Miss Jenkins 10,000 in 'tips' which she says she is using to buy a car, pay for school and help her church
