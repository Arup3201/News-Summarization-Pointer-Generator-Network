Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal admitted he liked the way QPR played in defeat to his side at Loftus Road on Saturday.

However, mistakenly calling Harry Redknapp's side 'Queens Park Raisins' in a post-match interview with Sky Sports slightly tarnished the Dutchman's sentiments.

The Hoops’ ‘currant’ run of form sees them without a win in their previous five Premier League games.

Goals from Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson were enough to earn Van Gaal’s side all three points and condemn QPR to yet another defeat.

But the Dutch manager was clearly impressed with what he saw from Redknapp’s side and was quick to compliment the west London club following their display at Loftus Road.

Although those connected with the club in any way would probably have taken the praise slightly more seriously if he had managed to get their name right.

Instead, football fans took to Twitter to poke fun at the former Barcelona manager for his unfortunate mistake in front of the rolling cameras as his gaffe went viral.
