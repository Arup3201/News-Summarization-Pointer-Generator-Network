Prince George of Cambridge's first birthday is to be marked with a commemorative £5 coin.

The
 Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's young son is the first member of the 
royal family to have his first birthday honoured with a new UK coin.

William
 and Kate, along with George's great-grandmother the Queen and 
Chancellor George Osborne approved the design of the sterling silver 
piece, which bears the heraldic royal arms and the year 2014.

Milestone: Prince George, pictured yesterday, is already standing on two feet. This commemorative coin will mark his first birthday

Symbolic: The coin features royal arms and a rose, thistle, leek, sprig of shamrock and a crown

Third
 in line to the throne and future king George, who was photographed 
walking with the help of his mother and playing with a football at a 
polo match in Cirencester at the weekend, turns one on July 22.

Shane
 Bissett, director of commemorative coin and bullion at the Royal Mint, 
said: 'As Prince George of Cambridge reaches the significant milestone 
of turning one year old, we felt there could be no more fitting design 
to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the 
arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne.

Day out: Yesterday the Duchess of Cambridge  took George along to watch Prince William and Prince Harry play in the Jerudong Trophy polo match

Nearly a year ago: The prince will turn one on 22nd July

'The
 choice of a silver coin is significant too as the precious metal is 
closely associated with newborn babies, as crossing the palm of a 
newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good health 
throughout their life, whilst the £5 coin is a favourite for royal 
celebrations.'

There will be a limited mintage of 7,500 of the birthday coins, which will cost £80 each.

The
 heraldic royal arms - which incorporates the four quarterings of the 
royal arms each contained in a shield, as well as a rose, thistle, leek,
 a sprig of shamrock and a crown - was originally created for the Queen 
and was last used on a coin struck for the British Exhibition in New 
York in 1960.

Both George's birth and his christening were marked with commemorative coins.

Later today, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will join the Queen for the annual Order of the Garter service today.

Hundreds of spectators will be treated to the sight of Garter Knights walking through the grounds of Windsor Castle wearing their lavish blue velvet robes and black velvet hats with white plumes.

The Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will also be among the royal party at the ceremony in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

The £5 birthday coin will be available via www.royalmint.com and is priced at £80.
