Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet has backed Belgian striker Divock Origi to be a success at Anfield. 

The 19-year-old joined Liverpool after impressing at last summer's World Cup but was loaned back to Lille for this season. 

Origi has endured a difficult spell in Ligue 1 - scoring just seven league goals this campaign - and was recently voted the second most overrated player in a poll by France Football.

But Mignolet expects his international team-mate to shine at Liverpool, whom he will join next season.

'He is looking forward to next season and I think he will be ready for the team when he comes in,' revealed Mignolet in an interview with Liverpool's TV station.

'He is back to his old self (having struggled for goals earlier this season). Lille were struggling at one point in the season and he is only a young player, but from what I have seen of him in training he is a very good player and will do really well for us.

'He is very quick, he’s got skill and can hold the ball up too – what more do you want from a striker? He has got a good attitude to work hard in training and he is willing to learn, so I can only speak in good terms about him. 

Mignolet also revealed how Origi can't wait to join up with his new Liverpool team-mates later this year.

He said: 'I spoke with him a fair few times about next season about how he is going to settle not only at the club but in the city. He is looking forward to the pre-season tour and what that is all about because he has heard many things about that.

'When I spoke to him last week, he was really excited to come over and that is understandable also.'
