A spirited Scotland side inspired by Stuart Hogg came up just short against a French outfit that held on for an opening day Six Nations win.

Vern Cotter’s side gave as good as they got for most of the match but five penalties from Camille Lopez secured the win for the French.

Scotland replacement winger Dougie Fife was both saint and sinner for the Scots. It was his try from a pass from prop Euan Murray that gave Scotland hope. But it was also his indiscipline when he threw the ball away in frustration gave the home side three easy, vital points.

Despite the defeat the spirit shown by the Scots in Paris is a good omen for the rest of the Six Nations. As for the French they struggled to find the right tempo and only the kicking of Lopez kept the scoreboard ticking over for them

Scotland got off to the worst possible start when Blair Cowan was penalised for holding on which gave Camille Lopez an easy penalty to open the scoring.

Captain Greig Laidlaw drew the scores level with one of his own after the French collapsed a scrum.

Lopez increased the home sides lead with a penalty from in front of the posts just before Scotland were dealt a major blow when winger Tommy Seymour went off with a hip injury after just 17 minutes to be replaced by Dougie Fife.

Stuart Hogg’s penalty attempt from within his own half drifted aimlessly wide but even attempting a kick from so far out showed the confidence the Scotland full-back was showing.

Minutes later Hogg was at it again with his jinking run nearly leading to a Scotland try. After four phases of attacking play Finn Russell made a real hash of a relatively simple drop goal attempt.

Hogg was nearly in at the corner in another move with the full-back held up just short.

Three minutes before the break Lopez put over his third penalty of the match.

Hogg was again at the heart of the action starting a sweeping move that ended with prop Euan Murray playing in replacement Fife for a try. Laidlaw’s conversion attempt came back off a post.

The French tried their best to take the game to the Scots early in the second half but struggled to find a way through.

Try scorer Fife then gifted France three points when he threw the ball away in frustration and was penalised by referee Nigel Owens. Lopez made the most of the Scotland’s petulance by putting over his fourth penalty.

He missed his fifth attempt that came back off a post but the French had the upperhand.

The Scotland cause wasn’t helped when Johnnie Beattie was yellow carded just after the hour mark for pulling down a maul.

The small margins between success and failure came when Tim Visser just failed to connect to a pass that was taken off his fingers by Yoann Huget. The French winger sped up the line only for a great tackle from Bennett to stop him.

Scotland were always in the running but were dealt a hammer blow two minutes from time when Lopez put over his fifth penalty.
