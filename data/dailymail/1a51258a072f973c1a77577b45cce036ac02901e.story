Her dulcet tones have seen her labelled ‘the voice of an angel’.

But Katherine Jenkins has now revealed that she possesses another decidedly unique affliction – she sleeps with her eyes open.

The classical singer, who looked typically glamorous as she stepped out in a strapless black gown on Monday evening, has admitted that she suffers from Nocturnal Lagophthalmos, a condition which means sufferers are unable to fully close their eyes when they sleep.

launch party for Martell Cognac at London restaurant Le Caprice on Monday

Doctors have describe the condition as a form of facial paralysis which can lead to dry, irritated and damaged eyes.Sufferers produce fewer tears to wash away debris such as dust and bacteria which can collect in their eyes, which leads to blurred vision and can make them more susceptible to infections.

It is not always known what causes the 
condition, although infections, genetics, traumas and strokes can all 
lead to the problem.

The 33-year-old star said she has lived 
with the problem, which is believed to affect around ten percent of the 
population, since she was a child.

She revealed she is a sufferer after recalling an anecdote about how she was once complimented on her eyes by an admirer.

She said in a recent interview: ‘The best chat up line to ever come my way is: “Was you father a thief because he must have stolen the stars from the skies and put them in your eyes?” Speaking of which I always sleep with my eyes open.

‘My eyes don’t close properly - they are always at least half open - and when I go to sleep I look like I’m still awake. And I don’t really have dreams either. My Mum would always say: “Katherine, are you awake or are you asleep?’

Miss Jenkins’ 
condition is described by doctors as a form of facial paralysis and can 
cause the eyes to dry, get irritated, and it can also injure the 
corneas.

When there are fewer tears available to wash away debris like dust and bacteria, sufferers experience blurred vision and more frequent eye infections.

It is not always known what causes the condition, although infections, genetics, traumas and strokes can all lead to the problem.

Solutions include strapping the eye shut by laying an adhesive dressing strip vertically from the upper eyelid to the cheek. Eye patches are recommended, while eye masks can also be used.

Showing off 
her enviable figure in a black strapless gown, the star teamed her look 
with a pair of large statement silver earrings and a splash of bright 
red lipstick as she posed with fellow guest, celebrity chef Raymond 
Blanc.

Earlier this month it was revealed that Miss Jenkins has signed a cut-price recording contract with Universal Music, after her and her former record company Warner Music Entertainment mutually decided not to extend her contract.

The singer signed with the Universal-owned Decca label after her lucrative £5.8m, three-album deal with Warner Music came to an end earlier this year.

Her first album, Premiere, became the fastest-selling classical CD of all time. However her last album, This is Christmas, only reached No 26 in the charts.
