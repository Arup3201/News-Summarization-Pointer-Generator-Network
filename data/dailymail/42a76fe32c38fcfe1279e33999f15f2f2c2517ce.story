A young male barista gave a young mother a free coffee after a middle-aged woman complained about her breast feeding in Starbucks.

Julia Wykes was out in Ottawa, Canada when she popped into the multi-national coffee shop for a break. When her five-month old son started whinging, she fed him at the counter.

As the temperature was 39c, Ms Wykes said she had no intention of covering her young son while feeding him. 'I am not going to suffocate my child to save you from the potential glimpse of side-boob.'

As she was feeding her son, a middle-aged woman asked the young man behind the counter to 'deal with' the situation.

Since sharing her story with a local parenting group, the story has gone viral on the internet.

Speaking to the PhD in Parenting group on Facebook, Ms Wykes said: 'If you're 
ever at Starbucks in Trainyards (Ottawa), give them a good tip! This 
morning I was nursing my son in Starbucks and a woman very loudly 
complained (so she knew I could hear) to the baristas that they should 
get me to stop doing that in public as it was disgusting.

'The barista 
smiled at her and said he would handle it. I was gearing up for a fight,
 but he came over with a free drink for me and said loudly "And here's a
 voucher for a free drink next time you're in here, I am so sorry that 
you had to deal with such unpleasantness today." Coming from an at most 
19- year-old guy!'

The young male barista apologised for the woman's offensive comments before giving her a refill and a voucher for a free coffee on a later visit

Ms Wykes later wrote about her experiences on Huffington Post: 'I went to Starbucks with my 5-month-old to grab a coffee. He started to fuss, I sat down to nurse him to calm him, and a middle-aged woman asked a teenage barista to get me to stop breastfeeding, loudly calling it "disgusting".

'He took care of it -- by offering me a free refill, a voucher and an apology for the unpleasant experience as the complainer fled the scene. Yes, I'm the woman who shared this positive breastfeeding story with my local parenting group. It went viral in 24 hours.'

Ms Wykes said she was astounded by the level of interest her story has attracted. Some of the comments she has received have been supportive, but many, including some from women, have been abusive.

She said: 'What shocked me most in all of this is how many of these negative voices came from women. From the original complaining customer to those posting their comments online, I am truly afraid of what it means for our society that adult women find it acceptable to insult and belittle other women for breastfeeding in public -- basically for having breasts and using them as nature intended.'

The original Facebook post has almost 30,000 Likes and has been shared more than 1,800 times.

Ms Wykes said on the day she was feeding her son it was 39c in Ottowa, so he had no intention of covering her child, or even going to her car as it was so hot.
