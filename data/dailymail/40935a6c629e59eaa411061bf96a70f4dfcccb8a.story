Beer belly raider: Frank Asante was caught by police stuffing a rucksack up his top to mislead witnesses into thinking he was carrying a bit of extra weight

An armed robber fresh out of jail was collared by police officers despite wearing a fake beer belly in a bid to disguise himself as he carried out a string of raids.

Frank Asante hid a full rucksack under his coat to trick witnesses into thinking he had a huge gut as he stormed into bookies across the country.

The 40-year-old raided premises in Northampton, Leicestershire, Hertfordshire, Crawley and across London over a two-month period, after being released from prison in Feburary.

Woolwich Crown Court heard how the first armed raid came just 16 days after his release from a four-and-a-half-year stint for armed robbery.

CCTV evidence showed Asante holding up the various bookies dressed in a black jacket with a hood.

Showing the culprit to be brandishing a pistol the images suggested the armed robber was carrying extra weight around his middle.

Witnesses told detectives he was easily recognisable because of his 'big belly'.

But the ruse was soon uncovered when Flying Squad officers discovered the thug had done a bunk from his bail hostel and started following him to an address in Peckham, south London.

They watched as he made his way to a bookies in Newham, east London, with a rucksack on his back.

Minutes later they observed as Asante ducked into an alleyway, emerging wearing the rucksack on his front, making it appear as though he had a 'big belly'.

Before the convicted criminal could strike, police officers grabbed him and pulled off his disguise.

Caught in the act: Asante was spotted by officers following him, emerging from an alleyway with his rucksack stuffed up his top. Officers arrested him in Newham, east London after a string of armed robberies

Asante was found guilty of 12 robberies and 13 counts of possession of a firearm and jailed for 10 years last week.

Detective Inspector Mark Field said, this week: 'Only two weeks after being released from prison, this man began a terrifying campaign of armed robberies across the country.

'Wearing a balaclava and armed with a gun, he targeted bookmakers, mostly with lone female members of staff.

'I would like to commend the work of my team who worked closely with colleagues in Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Hertfordshire and Sussex Police to bring this man to justice.

'We have been instrumental in putting a dangerous man and a prolific armed robber behind bars where he belongs.'
