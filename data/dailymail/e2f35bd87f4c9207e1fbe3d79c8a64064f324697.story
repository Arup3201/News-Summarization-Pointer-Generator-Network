A car was flipped over and several fires set when college football fans rioted to celebrate a team victory.

After West Virginia University defeated Oklahoma State on Saturday night, dozens of supporters took to the streets of Morgantown, causing major damage.

WVU, which was last week named America's top party college, has a tradition of celebrating sporting success by setting fires.

Vandals: A group of young men were filmed tipping over a car after a West Virginia University football game

The latest incident came following the school's 30-21 victory over OSU at Mountaineer Field.

A group of young men were filmed trying to flip a silver Volkswagen, cheered on by a raucous crowd shouting, 'Flip it!'

They succeeded in getting the car on its side, but ran away from the scene when a police officer approached.

A video of the incident was posted on YouTube, but was later removed.

Excitement: Three men were initially filmed trying to push the car onto its back

Effort: The vandals were encouraged by a watching crowd who shouted, 'Flip it!'

Police are currently examining social-media posts about the vandalism in an effort to identify those responsible.

A university spokesman said that if the perpetrators are found to have been WVU students, they will face punishments which could include suspension or expulsion.

In addition to the car-flipping incident, 10 fires were set around the college town, with one person arrested and charged with malicious burning.

Team effort: Bystanders went to help the rioters as they wrestled with the silver Volkswagen

Failure: They only managed to get the car on its side before running away when the police arrived

Lighting fires is a common way of celebrating victories by WVU's successful sports teams, the Mountaineers.

The college was last week named the most party-loving in the U.S., ahead of the University of Wisconsin.

The chaos regularly caused by WVU students last year led the mayor of Morgantown to suggest that the town could levy a $20 surtax on all undergraduates to pay for extra police and firefighters.
