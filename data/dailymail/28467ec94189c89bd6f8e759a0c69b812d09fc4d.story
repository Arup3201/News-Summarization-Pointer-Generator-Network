A man has given more than $21,000 to charity after collecting all the loose change he found lying around for 10 years.

Rick Snyder, from Bradenton, Florida, says he found the bulk of the coins - and the odd note - during his daily four-hour walks.

The cash, which weighed more than 2,500lbs, was donated to the Gulf Shore Animal League, a charity which cares for feral cats.

Rick Snyder's $21,495 haul of loose change weighed more than 2,500lbs and filled more than 100 jars

Mr Snyder said that he found most of the money left in vending machines and car washes, collecting around $5.60 a day.

'It astounds me how wasteful people are,' Snyder, who also collects thrown away towels so he can wash them and give them to shelters, told the Bradenton Herald.

He said: 'I've been taking care of feral cats for years and I started noticing a lot of change laying around. So I started picking it up and keeping track of it.

'$10,000 was my first goal and then I hit that and I wasn’t satisfied. 

'I said I’d keep going so I got to 100 jars and thought "well I’ll keep going". $20,000 was my next goal and I exceeded that.'

He eventually reached $21,495, which he donated in its entirety to the charity for feral cats.

Mr Snyder owns a 48-unit condominium complex, and has found families for about 100 cats by homing them with his tenants.

'People do avoid me now if they see me coming,' he joked.

Asked why he did not keep the cash for himself, Mr Snyder said: 'I have enough money.' 

He added that he would continue to pick up and more cash he finds and give it to charity again.

The donation is the largest the rescue group has ever received from one person.

Cheryl Wade, president of the Gulf Shore Animal league, said: 'This is just so over the top. It will help so many animals in our community.'

She added that the money would be used to help care for kittens which are too young to be adopted.
