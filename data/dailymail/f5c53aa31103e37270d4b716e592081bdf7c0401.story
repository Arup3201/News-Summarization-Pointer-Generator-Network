A couple celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary today reveal their secret to a long marriage - having a good row every day.

Edwin and Mary Daubney believe a daily squabble between husband and wife always clears the air - and think other married couples should heed their advice to help wedded bliss.

Although Edwin and Mary's exchanges are rarely anything more serious than him leaving doors open and she 'always being right', they believe that a few cross words have made them closer over the years.

Clearing the air: Edwin and Mary Daubney believe a daily squabble always clears the air

And Edwin, 93, says there's nothing better than to say those three special words: 'you're right, dear.'

Ironically the couple, who have been affectionately nicknamed 'Darby and Moan' met in 1942 following another argument - this time between Edwin and a love rival about who should ask Mary for the last waltz at a town hall dance.

Since then their marital War of the Roses has continued with Lancashire-born Edwin and Yorkshire-born Mary, 89, bickering over who left the lights on and whose turn it was to tidy up.

The golden oldies celebrated their sapphire wedding anniversary with a family party at a hotel in their hometown of Glossop, Derbyshire last weekend.

Mary, 89, said: 'We only bicker over silly things really - but I do think those little rows keep us happier because everything is in the open.

The little things: The couple are celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary and attribute their long marriage to having an argument every single day, even over little things

'There are no secrets between us and nobody is brooding or sulking. We have a little disagreement and then we move on.

'We usually have little arguments about whose turn it is to tidy up. Edwin also has a thing for leaving doors and drawers open, as well as constantly leaving lights on.

'I'm always pulling him about it and I think he only has a moan when I moan at him - but that's just because he knows I'm right.'

Longevity: The couple first met in 1942 at a dance at the town hall (where they had an argument over who would dance with Mary)

Dance partners: 'We met in the town hall at a dance. I used to love dancing and that was something we used to do often in those days' said Mary

The couple first met in 1942 at a dance at the town hall in Hessle near Hull when Edwin was stationed from his role as an anti-tank rifle operator with the South Lancashire Regiment during World War Two, and Mary worked in an aircraft munitions factory.

They married just eight months later on January 2, 1943 in Hessle Parish Church.

Mary said: 'We met in the town hall at a dance. I used to love dancing and that was something we used to do often in those days.

Family: Couple have 10 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren

'Edwin asked if he could have the last waltz and I said yes. It turned out that he was arguing with a friend over who would ask me and Edwin won - so you could say we even met because of a row.'

She added: 'I remember getting married like it was yesterday. It was snowing and we couldn't have our pictures taken so we had to wait till later at the reception to have them taken - I'm sure there were a few words exchanged between us then.'

After having their eldest daughter, Pam, now 68, the couple moved to Manchester and Edwin worked as a telephone engineer and Mary worked in an office at the Smithfield market in Manchester.

They and went on to have three more children, 10 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.

Mary said: 'We have always been close as a family - most of us live within about 20 minutes of each other, which is nice.

'Pam takes me out quite a bit and Edwin likes to go out on his mobility scooter when he can so we have a little time apart to do our own things.'

'Despite our little tiffs we are still as firmly in love now as we were back them. I don't think the majority of people these days who are getting together will last like we have.

'The problem is it's too easy for people to pack marriage in rather than stay together now and give it a go.

'When Edwin tells me off for not putting things away after I've used them I just tell him I'll put them away when I'm good and finished with them.'

Mary said: 'We had such a nice party four 70th wedding anniversary. All our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren all came to visit us which was lovely.

Healthy marriage: They usually argue over little things like Edwin leaving the lights on

'Our eldest Pam made us a special anniversary cake with fruit and sponge with roses on the top and we all enjoyed having a little party.

'It was also a rare day for us too because we didn't have a go at each other about anything. I'm sure that was was because we were celebrating and there was nothing to complain about.'

Edwin said: 'Mary tells me off for leaving a door open before I've even gone through it and it was usually case of I'm in the wrong.

'In the past I would give back as good as I got but over the years I've just learnt to say three special words: "you're right, dear." - and she probably is.'
