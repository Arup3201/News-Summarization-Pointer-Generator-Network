This CCTV footage shows the terrifying moment machete-wielding robbers stormed a petrol station before speeding off in a BMW.

The clip shows three men armed with an axe and a knife enter a petrol station in Failsworth, Greater Manchester, at around 6pm on Saturday.

One of the men threw a brick at one of the shop assistants in the Texaco petrol station in Oldham Road.

They then move behind the counter and using the axe and knife, shepherded two victims into the staff kitchen at the back of the building.

The offenders then kicked down a door and attempted, but failed, to open the safe.

Instead they grabbed cash from the till and drove off in a grey BMW 3 Series with the licence plates covered.

The first offender is described as white, around 6ft tall with a slim build. 

He was wearing a long-sleeved black top, black trousers, black gloves and a black mask covering his face. 

Packets of cigarettes flew from the shelves behind the till after the brick was thrown 

He was carrying a knife, described as 1ft long with a slightly curved blade.

The second offender is described as white, 5ft 7in to 5ft 8in tall with a slim build. 

He was wearing the same clothing the first offender, but carrying an axe which had a 1ft long handle and a silver straight blade.

The third offender stood at 5ft 6in tall and was wearing the same black clothing as the other two men.

Threatening the victims with the axe and knife, they shepherded two victims into the staff kitchen at the back 

 The offenders then kicked down a door and attempted, but failed, to open the safe and instead grabbed cash 

Detective Constable Mike Hayman said: 'The two victims were fortunately unhurt, but were understandably left shaken by the force and aggression shown by these males.

'As you can see from the CCTV, the shop assistant was inches away from serious injury as the brick thrown by one of the men smashes into the cigarette display.

'The offenders were armed and used force to get what they wanted, it is vital that we track them down as quickly as possible.'

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9080 or Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

After forcing the victims to the back of the building, took cash from the till and drove off in a grey BMW 3 Series with the licence plates covered
