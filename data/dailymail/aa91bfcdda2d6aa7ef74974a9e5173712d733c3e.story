Taco Bell has taken decisive action against their now infamous taco licking employee by announcing he has been sacked.

On Monday, fast food fans collectively wretched as a shocking photograph of a red-haired man licking a stack of unfilled shells was discovered on Taco Bell's official Facebook page.

While the identity of the licker has yet to be revealed, the man in question has apparently taken to social media to provide a picture of himself and confirm he has lost his job because of his disgusting stunt.

Tongue lashing: This unnamed employee has lost his job after this photograph was posted to the Taco Bell Facebook page and went viral

The photograph was posted on Sunday by a 'Jj O'Brien Nolan' and it set off a PR nightmare for the fast food chain.

They said that the photo was created as a jibe against a company wide contest in which employees submitted enjoying their first bite of the heavily hyped Cool Ranch Dorito taco.

Today, in response to a deluge of negative publicity, Taco Bell confirmed that the worker had been identified and fired.

'Our franchisee is responsible for the employment and conduct of his restaurant’s employees and he has informed us that he immediately suspended the employee shown in the photo and is in the process of terminating his employment.

'The employee who took the photo no longer works there.'

Initially it was not confirmed whether the photograph was a fake or if the tacos were indeed meant for the trash or were used in food preparation.

Taco Bell denied they were.

'Our food handling procedures are strict and we have zero tolerance for any violations,' Taco Bell said in a statement released on Monday.

'The taco shells were used for training in March before we launched a new product, and were in process of being thrown out.'

Going further later in the day after the picture was widely shared across the Internet, Taco Bell tried to get a handle on the situation.

'Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and team members, and we have strict food handling procedures and zero tolerance for any violations,' said a statement.

'When we learned of the situation we immediately contacted this restaurant's leadership and although we believe it is a prank and the food was not served to customers, we are conducting a full scale investigation and will be taking swift action against those involved.'

Today it was confirmed that the restaurant was in Ridgecrest, California and that the unidentified staff member has indeed been fired.

Cathy Marx, the manager of Taco Bell in Ridgecrest, Calif., told CNBC, 'We’re currently dealing with it.'

Taco Bell immediately replied to the original posting onto Facebook by Jj O'Brien Nolan - defending their food practices and promising swift action

Marx's restaurant has an A rating from the Kern County public health department, the report noted.

Despite the risks of being caught, this isn't the first time fast food workers have gotten into hot water over questionable treatment of food photographed and posted to social media.

In April, a KFC worker posted photographs of herself licking a pile of mashed potatoes on Facebook and was promptly fired by her employer.

Last year, three Burger King employees from Ohio were fired after images of them standing in two bins full of shredded lettuce were uploaded to their Facebook pages.

And in another shameful Taco Bell image, a worker tweeted a photograph of himself urinating into a plate of nachos in August last year.

‘I pissed on them where nobody could see, in private, and I threw them away. There’s literally nothing they can do. Fire me. I don’t care,’ Cameron Jankowski of Fort Wayne said of the photo.

Taco Bell took him up on his offer and he was relieved of duties immediately.
