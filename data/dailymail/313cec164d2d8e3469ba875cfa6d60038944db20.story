From Felipe Massa’s watery eyes to the stress-lined face of Jules Bianchi’s worried boss, a mood of sombre reflection fell upon the paddock ahead of the Russia Grand Prix.

Grand Prix racing drivers — as competitive a breed as exists in sport — thought of their colleague, and in some cases friend, who remains desperately ill after suffering head injuries when he crashed into a recovery vehicle in Japan last Sunday.

The words they spoke were measured. They offered no quick fixes. They refused to point fingers. The only driver who broke ranks was Sergio Perez, Force India’s Mexican, who described the accident as ‘totally unacceptable’.

He added: ‘We have to look for answers from the FIA. We have to make sure they hear us. We will go through the full detail. In future when there is a tractor coming to pick up a car, we need a safety car no matter what the conditions.’

So why did not one of the other 21 other drivers speak even a small fraction as vehemently as Perez about the circumstances surrounding the crash? They were under instruction not to from the GPDA — the drivers’ association — and team bosses.

Without doubt it was in part because criticising the FIA has never been politically expedient. That is how Formula One works. There was also, it seemed, a genuine desire not to betray their sport by airing their private concerns in public at such a sensitive time.

As Jenson Button, the most experienced driver on the grid, said: ‘I can’t say anything yet. Most of us understand that being massively outspoken now, or letting our emotion get the better of us, doesn’t always help the situation.

‘It’s better to sit down, when you know all the facts, make improvements and speak out accordingly. That’s not the case right now. It’s just a very emotional time, thinking of Jules and his family.’

The GPDA drivers, who number about 18, will instead meet on Friday night in the paddock to discuss their suggestions for safety improvements.

Among the issues on the agenda is likely to be whether the safety car should always be deployed when a tractor is removing a car, such as happened on Sunday when Bianchi hit the tractor that was there to remove Adrian Sutil’s Sauber.

The timing of races to avoid dusk is likely to be another topic of debate. The usual pre-race driver briefing with race director Charlie Whiting will also be held tonight.

FIA president Jean Todt, who has ultimate responsibility for safety, was due to arrive in Sochi on Thursday night and is expected to hold a press conference on Friday, addressing the implications of the crash, after asking Whiting for a full report.

The shock of Sunday’s events was no more palpable than at Marussia, where chief executive Graeme Lowdon spoke of 25-year-old Bianchi as ‘not only an exceptional driver, but an exceptional human being’.

Lowdon, clearly worn down by events but still lucid, said the team still had not decided whether to race in Russia.

Although they met the 4pm deadline to register their drivers — Max Chilton and reserve driver Alexander Rossi — they may yet withdraw one or both. They will be guided in this by the wishes of Bianchi’s parents and, conceivably, by his condition. Another possible consideration is Chilton’s state of mind and readiness to drive after he missed his usual media engagements yesterday.

The 21 drivers will carry the message ‘Tous avec Jules’ (All with Jules) on their helmets in Sunday’s race. Their sense of anguish was felt deeply by Williams’ Massa, a friend of Bianchi, who called the Japanese Grand Prix, ‘the worst race of my life’.

This from a man who was seriously injured when a spring from Rubens Barrichello’s Brawn hit him in the head while driving a Ferrari in the Hungarian Grand Prix five years ago.

‘I didn’t remember that accident,’ said Massa of his own knockout blow.

‘Maybe tomorrow in practice it will get a little bit better because at least you are working, at least you have something to think about, some issue to put inside your brain.’ 

Bianchi's name will be above the Maurssia garage ahead of the weekend's race in Sochi 

The issue of enclosed cockpits is another subject for the sport to consider.

But would even a fighter-jet style canopy have saved Bianchi, when he hit a steel truck at a speed seemingly in excess of 100mph?

There is also the question of Formula One’s heritage.

‘There are positives,’ said Button of canopies, ‘but this is Formula One and it has been open cockpits since the start of time.’
