First, she suffered the indignity of being hugged by a sweaty LeBron James during a charity basketball match.

Now, a video has emerged of the Duchess of Cambridge rolling her eyes after being exhorted to 'keep wrapping' during a visit to a children's centre in New York.

In the short clip, the Duchess, who is busily wrapping a gift, is seen being tapped on the shoulder by a well-wisher.

One is not amused! The Duchess delivers an eye roll following the intervention from the well wisher

As she looks round and smiles, Kate is told to 'keep wrapping' by the anonymous passer-by and quickly turns back to the job at hand - but not before rolling her eyes in irritation.

The incident occurred during a visit to the Northside Center for Child Development in the deprived Harlem district of New York

Joined by a group of local grandmothers, the Duchess was helping to wrap presents destined for some of the city's poorest children.

Despite the rude interruption, the Duchess appeared to enjoy the experience, with one local telling MailOnline that she and Kate had spent the time 'chatting like old friends'.

Cheerful: The video begins with Kate happily wrapping presents in the Harlem children's centre

Intervention: The well-wisher appears behind her and exhorts her to 'keep wrapping'

Not happy: A clearly displeased Duchess of Cambridge rolls her eyes in consternation as she looks away

Mary Dawkins, 71, a grandmother of six from Harlem, also joined forces to hold down the paper covering a doll, and stick the wrapping in place.

Afterwards, Mrs Dawkins said: 'We sat together wrapping gifts - she's my girl. She said she has to wrap gifts when she gets home.'

Kate's display of irritation was a rarity - the Duchess is not known for her temper or, indeed, making any sort of fuss.

But while the Duchess of Cambridge is rarely ruffled by the actions of well wishers or the media, the same cannot be said for other members of the royal family.

In 2004, Prince Harry became involved in a scuffle with photographers outside a nightclub after they attempted to take pictures of him and his friends leaving the venue.

The royal was accused of similar behaviour three years later, this time in a bid to prevent photos of him and then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy being taken.

All smiles: Prior to the incident, the Duchess had been helping grandmother Mary Dawkins to wrap presents

Concentration: The Duchess managed to wrap several gifts during her visit to the children's centre

Old friends: Mrs Dawkins said she and the Duchess had chatted like 'old friends' during the encounter

Helping out: The visit was part of the royal tour of New York which ended on Tuesday night

Prince Charles, who in 2005 revealed that he hates 'facing the media', has also been known to lash out, famously branding BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell 'awful' and claiming he couldn't 'bear that man'.

Most famously irascible of all though, is the Duke of Edinburgh - a man not known for keeping his opinions, however sharp, to himself.

Speaking to the matron of a Caribbean hospital during a 1966 visit, he made his thoughts on the Press plain.

'You have mosquitoes,' he quipped. 'I have the Press!'

Indignity: Later the same day, Kate suffered the indignity of being hugged by a sweaty basketball player

Pro: The Duchess wasn't in the least put out by the second incident and allowed Mr James to hug her
