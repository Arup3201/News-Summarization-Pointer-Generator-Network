She was a 'doctor, dietician, psychologist, bail-goer and friend' to thousands of mostly African Americans crippled by poverty in the 1950s.

Yet tireless South Carolina nurse-midwife Maude Callen - who delivered hundreds of children, cared for the elderly and educated midwifery students in a 400-mile area 'veined with muddy roads' - never considered herself a hero.

Her's was a labor of love, captured in these extraordinary black and white photographs taken by legendary shooter W. Eugene Smith for LIFE magazine.

Smith's 20 picture-strong essay, splashed across a dozen pages in December 1951, was considered 'one of the most extraordinary photo essays ever to appear in [LIFE] magazine.'

The LIFE magazine spread, Nurse Midwife, chronicled Callen’s vital work, including the terrifying delivery of Alice Cooper's baby.

According to the original LIFE article, Callen raced to the village of Pineville on the edge of Hell Hole Swamp, when the midwife noticed signs of trouble in Cooper's birth and hastily called for Callen.

When the experienced midwife arrived after 6pm, Cooper’s labor grew more severe, lasting through the night until dawn.

She luckily delivered a healthy son - something that LIFE said was not commonplace in the South in the 1950s when superstitious 'granny' midwives still presided over births.

The
gripping images and Callen's own incredible story triggered a flood of 
awe-struck letters to the publisher, calling the work 'one of the 
greatest pieces of photojournalism I have 
seen in years.'

In Callen's work, Smith saw something noble and extraordinary.

And so did hundreds of LIFE subscribers who sent donations, 
large and small, to help Callen in what one reader called 'her 
magnificent endeavor.'

LIFE magazine reported Callen was so overwhelmed by the response, she often sat in silence.

'Halfway through a recent day’s
mail, [Mrs. Callen] said to her husband: ‘I’m too tired and happy to 
read more tonight. I just want to sit here and be thankful,' she said, according to LIFE.

Eventually,
more than $20,000 in donations helped to build a clinic in Pineville, 
where Mrs. Callen worked until her retirement in 1971.

Callen received the Alexis de Tocqueville Society 
Award in 1984 for six decades of service to her community, and in 1989 
the Medical University of South Carolina awarded her an honorary 
degree, while the MUSC College of Nursing created a scholarship in her 
name.

Maude Callen died in 1990 at the age of 91 in Pineville, South Carolina.
