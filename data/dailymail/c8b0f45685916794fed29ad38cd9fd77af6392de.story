Kris Jenner's ex-husband Bruce Jenner was a world famous athlete who found fame representing his country. He was younger than Kris - by four years.

Now MailOnline can disclose that the new man in her life is also a sports hero, albeit at a lower level.

Handsome Corey Gamble was a standout star for his high school football team and was known by friends as 'Mr Dependable,' MailOnline can reveal exclusively.

it can also be disclosed that Gamble, who vacationed with Jenner in Mexico, is not 41, as had previously been reported, but 33.

The age gap makes him 26 years her junior - and younger than her two eldest children, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian who are 34 and 35 respetively.

Corey, who was spotted yesterday having lunch with momager Kris and daughters Khloe and Kourtney, was known for his cool and calm leadership in the field during his teen years.

Friends interviewed by MailOnline revealed that Gamble was one of the top players during his time at Westlake High School in Atlanta, Georgia.

Such was his leadership prowess he was one of the three captains chosen to lead the team.

The high school is famous in football circles for having five players on the NFL roster in one year - more than any other school in the country.

Former players include quarterback Cam Newton, Adam 'Pac man' Jones who played for the Cincinnati Bengals and Keyaron Fox who won a Super Bowl ring with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Another former alumni is Kasim Reed, the current Mayor of Atlanta.

Former classmates remember Gamble as a hard-working student who was able to combine the punishing schedule of high school sports activities for the 'Lions' football team with his studies.

After graduating from Westlake in 1999 he attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he obtained a degree in Business Management.

Gamble left Atlanta for Los Angeles soon after college to make his name in the music business and while mixing in the show business world met 59-year-old Jenner.

Despite the 26-year age gap, the couple seem set for a long relationship with members of Jenner's family giving their approval to Gamble.

He is currently part of the management team of Justin Bieber and has posted numerous photos of himself with the singer on his various social media accounts.

Private jets and luxury hotels feature prominently on his Instagram account - although he has been uncharacteristically silent since he began dating Jenner.

The relationship with Jenner has thrust him into the spotlight and that is something friends from his days at Westlake said would make him uncomfortable.

'The Corey I knew would not want to be the center of attention,' said a former school mate Sean Powell.

'He was really dependable and people could count on him to do the right thing.

'Corey was never in any trouble and just got on with his business. He loved to play football and was a key member of the Westlake team.'

Gamble, who now lives in Beverly Hills and travels the world as part of Bieber's entourage, enrolled at Westlake High School in 1996.

It is one of the top magnet schools Georgia with a strong academic and sports record.

Black and white photos from the school's year books show a studious looking Gamble.

By his junior year at the school he matured somewhat and sported a faint moustache.

As one of the 'jocks' at the school and with his good looks he had his fair share of female attention.

'Corey was considered quite a catch and there were plenty of girls from the cheerleading squad who fancied him,' said one former friend.

'The Westlake Football team were known throughout the state because of players who had gone on to the NFL.

'Anyone who made the team was considered something of a hero. Corey was a captain so that made him even more special.'

While others in his graduating year of 1999 posed up for photographs in evening dress and black tie Gamble's photo is noticeably absent.

He does appear in several photographs, including one where he is smiling as he walks with another student.

Like many yearbooks parents sent in gushing words of love and praise about their son or daughter to be included in the final year book of their high school careers. Others sent in cute baby photos.

There is no mention of Gamble in the 1999 book.

Staff at the school said it was likely he chose not to have his photograph featured in the year book.

One friend said Gamble was always very focused on what he wanted to do after school and set his heart on college.

He won a place at Morehouse College in Atlanta where former alumni include Martin Luther King, director Spike Lee and actor Samuel Jackson.

A former college friend, who did not want to be named, said:'Corey was very proud to be at Morehouse.

'He loved the tradition of the college and all that it stood for.'

Friends say he left for Los Angeles soon after graduating in 2003.

While Gamble has an online presence on the LinkedIn site, his work career remains something of a mystery.

He is reported to be part of the management team of Scooter Braun, Justine Bieber's manager, but does not appear on their website.

Gamble clearly knows Bieber as there are numerous photographs of the pair together on his Facebook and Instagram pages.

Attempts by MailOnline to speak with Gamble were met with silence - not surprising now that he is under the spell of Jenner who is known for her control of the Kardashian sisters and their multimillion dollar empire.

The relationship became public knowledge last month when they shared a romantic dinner at Casa Vega.

Cheeky: At one point, Corey got up close and personal as he clasped Kris' hand near the reality star's rear

A report by an Atlanta blogger that the couple met in Spain appears to have been false with an 'imposter' posing as Gamble giving the interview to Sandra Brown.

Other reports that he was aged 41 were also false,  with Gamble maintaining a discreet silence about his life and his relationship with Jenner,  who divorced her husband Bruce after 22 years of marriage earlier this year.

Jenner felt comfortable enough about her new man to include him at daughter Kim Kardashian's 34th birthday party in Las Vegas.

They then set off to Mexico and stayed at Joe Francis' home Casa Aramara in Punta Mita.

Gamble was also photographed at Van Nuys airport early Saturday with Jenner and her daughters after a night at Tao Las Vegas.

'Kris and Corey were cuddling,' a source told Us Weekly, and added Gamble was 'quite the gentleman' that evening.

'He walked her to the restroom,' the source said, and 'walked her out of Tao.'

'He seems very nice,' a source told People magazine.

After Kim posted a photo of her mom and Gamble on her Instagram account it received more than 560,000 likes.

Fans of the Kardashians wanted to know who 'guy next to Kris' was.

Jenner has made no secret of her desire to move on from her second failed marriage, her first to Robert Kardashian also ending in divorce.

During an interview with Giuliana Ranic she said: 'I want to definitely be in love.

'I like being in love. I think there's no better feeling in the world. So yeah, I mean, that would be amazing.'

Gamble has said nothing yet about being linked with the most famous reality TV family in the world.

He has yet to share any photos or thoughts on his social media accounts.

Former classmates are delighted that he appears to have found love - although one questioned why he would date a woman so much older.

'Good luck to him, but it is not something that is going to last forever,' said the former classmate.

'I am sure he is enjoying being in the spotlight and he must be having fun.'
