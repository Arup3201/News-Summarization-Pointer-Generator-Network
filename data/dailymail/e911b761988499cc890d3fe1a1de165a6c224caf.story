Left in agony: Geoffrey Sharp, 74, called 999 after falling over at home in Oxford - but the medics who attended told him 'ambulances are for emergencies'

A pensioner who broke his back in a fall was given two paracetamol tablets by paramedics - and told off for calling an ambulance.

Geoffrey Sharp, 74, called 999 after falling over at home in Oxford - but the medics who attended told him ‘ambulances are for emergencies’, before leaving him in agony with a neighbour.

The widower was left in ‘excruciating pain’ for three days before he managed to get to his GP - who diagnosed him with a fractured spine.

Mr Sharp said that the paramedics angrily gestured towards their vehicle after arriving at his home, saying: ‘What does it say up there?’

The retired financial worker responded ‘emergency’, before one of them allegedly replied: ‘That’s right, for real emergencies, not people like you who have just had a fall.’

Mr Sharp claimed that the uncaring paramedics simply gave him two paracetamol tablets and left him with a neighbour.

‘I was in agony - it took me half an hour to haul myself up to my seat to call the ambulance in the first place,’ he said. ‘I am sure most ambulance crews do a wonderful job, but these guys just took the mickey.’

It was only when he got an appointment with his GP at the Botley Medical Centre, three days later, that Mr Sharp was told he had fractured his spine and was taken to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital.

‘My doctor was furious,’ said the pensioner, who lost his wife Glenys three years ago on Christmas Eve, and whose son Danny died whilst serving in the Armed Forces.

He complained to South Central Ambulance Service following the incident in August last year.

Following an internal investigation, the service finally wrote back to Mr Sharp this week, with an apology for the ‘perceived rudeness’ of the crew.

The ambulance service said that one of the paramedics involved had already left the trust, while the other had been spoken to ‘to ensure improvement in his future practice’.

However, a spokesman said its internal investigation had found the decision not to take Mr Sharp to hospital was made with the consent of him and his doctor.

This is disputed by Mr Sharp, who is now being cared for full-time by his daughter Wendy.

A South Central Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘The ambulance crew have undertaken a full reflection of their actions to identify areas to improve future performance. This investigation ascertained that the clinical decisions were appropriate and were made in respect of the patient in conjunction with a doctor and in agreement with the patient at the time.

‘We are sorry to hear that Mr Sharp was not happy with our investigation. However, South Central Ambulance Service aims to provide the highest standards of response, care and treatment to our patients and the community.

‘Should Mr Sharp, or any complainant, not be content with our investigation, we would encourage them to contact us again so that we may conduct a further review.’
