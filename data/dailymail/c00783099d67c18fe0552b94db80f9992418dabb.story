Defender Alex Bruce is desperate for Hull to get their own back on Southampton.

The Saints did the double over the Tigers last season, easing to a 4-1 victory on home turf having already taken a 1-0 win at the KC Stadium.

Saints return to East Yorkshire on Saturday on the crest of a wave, lying second in the Barclays Premier League and having won nine of their last 10 matches in all competitions.

But Bruce believes his side have all the motivation they need to end that productive streak.

Alex Bruce wants Hull to get one over Southampton after two defeats last season 

'They were a bit of a bogey team for us last year,' said Bruce.

'They played very well here and at St Mary's. Hopefully we can put that right with a win.

'We have to approach it in the right way because we owe them one as it stands.

'They've hit the ground running this season but hopefully we can stop them in their tracks.'

Assistant manager Steve Agnew, meanwhile, insisted Tom Ince has a big role to play at Hull.

He joined the club with high hopes this summer, having been linked with Inter Milan, but has featured just three times in the league and was absent from several matchday squads before leaving on loan for Nottingham Forest this week.

But Agnew insists that is not the beginning of the end for the England Under-21 international.

'Tom came in pre-season and did ever so well then started the season with us,' he said.

'We changed the shape of the team and then one or two players in or out and Tom was one of those.

'We felt he hasn't played as much football as we would have liked so Steve agreed with Nottingham Forest to take him on loan until January.

'Hopefully he'll get some games in, perform like we know he can and it will be beneficial to all of us.

'He is a top player, an exciting player and one we're looking forward to working with for a good number of years.'
