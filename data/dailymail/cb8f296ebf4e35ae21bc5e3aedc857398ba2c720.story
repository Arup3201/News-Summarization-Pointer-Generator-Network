A retired bishop was among more than 50 people arrested after the Occupy Wall Street movement stormed another New York City park in an attempt to find a new home.

Former Episcopal bishop George E. Packard was led away in cuffs after climbing a ladder to illegally enter Juan Pablo Duarte Square in the west SoHo neighbourhood of the city during the demo.

He was one of hundreds of demonstrators, members of the clergy and elected officials who descended on the park and scaled a chain-link fence by a lot they’re eyeing as a new campsite.

Defiant: Retired Episcopal bishop George E. Packard is pictured climbing a ladder to illegally enter Duarte Square during an Occupy Wall Street march in New York City. He was promptly arrested for his actions

Cuffed: Packard was among more than 50 arrested when protesters broke a fence to access a vacant lot

Arrested: Packard was taken to a bus waiting by the demo in Duarte Park, near the city's SoHo neighbourhood

The protest came on the three month anniversary of the movement, police said. The park is owned by Trinity Wall Street Church.

According to NBC New York, church officials said that while they support the protestors, the space is not theirs to occupy.

But
 a chaplain from the Union Theological Seminary at Columbia University 
told DNAInfo that this was as good a space as any to foster the 
movement.

‘This movement needs a space where we can make democracy happen in person,’ Chris Ashley told the website.

Occupy 2.0: Protesters descend a wooden ladder into a private area of Duarte Park in West SoHo to what they hope is their new encampment

Holiday spirit: A scantily-clad (and patriotic) Santa climbs into Duarte Park. Around 1,000 protesters gathered in today's 'day of action'

Not clowning around: The property is owned by Trinity Wall Street Church, which did not give its permission for demonstrators to camp here

‘I want to bear witness that there’s plenty of us in the church that stand up to support this movement.’

Packard, who is affiliated with the movement, writes a blog under the title 'Occupied Bishop'.

He wrote a post just minutes before leaving for the demonstration, writing: 'What awaits us I do not know.'

Following his arrest, his wife updated the blog with details of the day's events, claiming she was repeated 'kneed' by a police officer.

Of her husband's arrest, she wrote: 'I am heartened to know he looks pretty happy in the paddy wagon!'

'(This event) is part of a call to reoccupy in the wake of the coordinated attacks and subsequent evictions of occupations across the nation and around the world. Vast resources sit unused while people are in need: in need of homes, schools, jobs and public places to gather and empower communities.'

Occupy Wall Street email

One man wearing a Santa suit stood among
 the protesters on the ladder as others cheered. While officers made 
arrests, protesters chanted obscenities and screamed: ‘Make them catch 
you!’

Other protesters chanted: 'Hell no, we won't go! Occupy 2.0!'

A fenced-off section of the square belongs to Trinity Church, while the rest of the half-block space is city-owned.

Occupy Wall Street, like their counterparts across the country, have to be dependent on ‘days of action’ such as these, where publicised events attract public support as well as media attention.

The protesters - like many in other cities and towns in the U.S. - were cleared out of Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan on November 15 and have been banned from sleeping there.

In cuffs: At least 50 people were arrested after today's demonstration, police said

An email sent out yesterday said: ‘Vast resources sit unused while people are in need: in need of homes, schools, jobs and public places to gather and empower communities.’

Twenty-two protesters and members of the press were arrested in Duarte Square the day Zuccotti was cleared.

Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori said in a statement Friday said it was ‘regrettable,' CBS News reported.

Occupy members want to seize the church’s property, and said taking what’s not theirs could end in ‘legal and police action,' she said.
