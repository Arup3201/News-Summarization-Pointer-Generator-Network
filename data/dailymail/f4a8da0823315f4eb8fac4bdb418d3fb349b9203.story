The Lake District’s natural beauty and breathtaking views have made it one of the most admired landscapes in Europe, attracting legions of enthralled visitors who return year after year.

But plans to relax planning restrictions on mobile phone masts and overhead cables could create a ‘free-for-all’ and leave Britain’s most beautiful areas ‘disfigured’, campaigners warned yesterday.

Under controversial proposals contained in a Bill to be debated in Parliament, ministers would be allowed to fast-track the expansion of broadband and 4G in rural areas for at least the next five years.

It means the Secretary of State would no longer be required to take into account an area’s natural beauty when deciding on the expansion of super-fast internet connection.

The 4G network will see existing 2G and 3G sites upgraded as well as new phone masts being installed to expand the network.

Critics yesterday condemned the proposal to relax planning restrictions as the biggest attack on national parks and areas of outstanding beauty in more than 50 years.

They say the proposals make a mockery of the laws that first gave national parks their protected  status under Clement Attlee’s Labour government in 1949.

Sir Andrew Motion, the former poet laureate and president of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, is understood to be against the proposals and lobbying privately to have them stopped.

The English National Park Authorities Association has also expressed alarm.

A leaked internal document by the ENPAA brands the changes ‘unnecessary’ and warns of an outcry once they are made public.

It adds: ‘We have seen no evidence that national park purposes have unduly hampered broadband or mobile communications delivery or justification for such a change to well-established legislation, and reject the inference that national park status has been a barrier to the roll-out of mobile/broadband technologies.

‘Parliament has established national parks with a clear purpose to protect their landscapes, wildlife and heritage and it is not appropriate to pick and choose when such protection should be afforded, and when not.

‘[It] is likely to give rise to a public reaction. This is likely to come in particular from concern about the Government’s commitment to landscape protection.’

Hilary Benn, shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, said the bill would create a ‘free-for-all’ that would ‘disfigure’ some of the most scenic parts of the country.

He added: ‘This risks undermining a planning system that has effectively balanced protecting our national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty from  intrusive and ugly development while also ensuring that high speed internet can be rolled out throughout the country, including to  communities living in these areas.’

The advent of 4G – fourth generation wireless services – has been described by industry experts as the biggest technology launch the UK has ever seen.

EE, the company behind T-Mobile and Orange, launched its 4G service last week. Customers are being promised speeds of between 8 and 12 megabits per second, as fast as the average home broadband connection.

Rivals Vodafone, O2 and Three will be able to launch their own 4G services in May next year after a government spectrum auction.
