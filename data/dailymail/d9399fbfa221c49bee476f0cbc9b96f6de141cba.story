On his first return to these shores since his amazing double of Scottish Open and Open Championship titles last July, Phil Mickelson would be fully entitled to look in his rear-view mirror with a  self-indulgent smile.

There, this veritable golfing pied piper would see not only  Rory McIlroy but Justin Rose, Ian  Poulter and Lee Westwood. From his own country he would spot Rickie Fowler plus 2014 PGA Tour winners Matt Every and Kevin Streelman. There’s Jimmy Walker, No 2 in the standings for America’s Ryder Cup team.

What’s going on? When you think of the sparse quality on view at last year’s Scottish Open, when none of these illustrious names showed up, it’s positively miraculous that so many would compete in this year’s edition, which starts at Royal Aberdeen on Wednesday — and it’s all down to Big Phil.

‘What he 
achieved last year  certainly got my attention and looking at my own 
Open record, I thought: "Why not try what Phil did?",’ said Rose. ‘Phil 
set the standard and put ideas in all of our heads,’ agreed Fowler.

Dressed in navy shorts and a crisp white shirt, the man in question bounces into a room set aside at a recent PGA Tour event to talk links golf, and particularly  his own evolution from out-of-his-depth malcontent to arch-exponent of this venerable form of the game.

But first, his outstanding role in the transformation of the Scottish Open from the worst field in its  history to the best. That must give him enormous pleasure?

‘It always seemed a common sense thing to me to come over a few days early and get acclimatised, and particularly if you live in the States,’ said Mickelson, who first played in the Scottish Open in 1992 and has only missed two editions since 2003.

‘It made even more sense when they moved it from Loch Lomond to links courses. My short game was so sharp during the Open at  Muirfield last year and a lot of that was due to the fact we had spent a week playing at Castle Stuart.

‘It gave me a lot of time to work on the different shots you need in firm conditions.’

Mickelson’s first experiences of links golf were actually quite encouraging. In 1991 he made the cut as an amateur on his Open debut at Birkdale before scoring three points out of four for America at the Walker Cup at Portmarnock. ‘That year I had Johnny Miller’s old caddie, Ted Halsall, on the bag at Birkdale and he said to me there was no doubt I would win an Open Championship one day,’ recalled Mickelson.

‘But as the years passed, I wasn’t so sure he was right. It was a  much longer process than I ever  imagined to get my game to accommodate links golf and there were times when I wondered whether I would ever manage it.

‘Because I had been brought up to fly the ball through the air I just got more upset with the crazy bounces and the cross winds.

THE GOODThe winner of the Scottish Open had never gone on to win the Open, but last year Mickelson did the double. He claimed his first European Tour event after a play-off at Castle Stuart and won by three strokes at Muirfield. THE BADMickelson started the last round of the 2011 Open on level par. He charged to six under at Royal St. George’s and shared the lead but finished second after four bogeys in six holes on the back nine.THE UGLYA month after coming second at the US Open in 1999, Mickelson was world No 10 and hotly tipped to do well at the Open.

‘Once I realised the idea was to get the ball on the ground and let it affect the ball more than the  air and the wind it became more  manageable. But there’s no  question it took me quite a while to really appreciate the greatness of the challenge.’

A breakthrough of sorts came at Royal Troon in 2004, when he started working with short-game guru Dave Pelz. ‘That was a real turning point for me, where we worked on shots to keep the ball down, and I ended up finishing third there, and missing out on the play-off by one shot,’ he said.

Nevertheless, it would be another seven years before he would get in contention again. In the wind and rain at Royal St George’s, Mickelson put together a front-nine charge in the final round, before running out of steam as the trophy went to Darren Clarke. So to last year, and Castle Stuart.

After Mickelson finished runner-up for the sixth time at the US Open the previous month we had a final day on the coast where he wouldn’t have had a prayer at one time, as the gusts reached 30mph.

Mickelson made it exciting by taking four on the last hole when a three would have won him his first title in Europe. But an exquisite chip decided the subsequent play-off against South African Branden Grace. ‘No-one likes a predictable movie now, do they?’ he told an adoring Scottish audience.

A win the week before a major is usually a kiss of death for a player’s chances at the big one, but Mickelson is no ordinary golfer. He once won the week before the Masters and then the green jacket itself, so had no fears he had peaked too early. Just the opposite, in fact. The Scottish Open trophy was all the evidence he needed he could play links golf at the highest level.

‘The win gave me so much momentum heading into the Open,’ recalled the 44-year-old. ‘I felt like I had all the tools at my disposal to do well at Muirfield. I had shown to myself I could play links golf in a decent wind and score well. That win gave me an awful lot of satisfaction.’

Not as much, however, as the one a week later. Trailing Westwood by five, Mickelson not only caught him but beat him by four strokes with a final round that sits alongside the finest in the tournament’s long and illustrious history.

No wonder he looks back on that fortnight as among the most satisfying of his career, and the Claret Jug has been with him everywhere on his travels. Back home in  California when friends come over for dinner he takes it out of the trophy cabinet and allows his companions to enjoy a tipple. ‘The coolest trophy in golf,’ he says.

As he prepares to leave the room, he has one final thing to say about that special July in Scotland and how proud he feels to be Open champion. ‘Do you know why winning the Claret Jug was so meaningful to me?’ he says. ‘It validated to me that I have become a complete player. I accomplished the goal of learning a form of golf that was completely different to the one I grew up playing.’
