Porn legend Ron Jeremy, 59, has been released from hospital after a near-death experience and he's already planning on getting back to business.

Doctors have told the prolific star that he's cleared to have sex after he left Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles around week ago.

Having survived the aneurysm near his heart that nearly killed him, he told TMZ: 'They said to me at the clinic, that if you can walk up two flights of 
stairs you're able to have sex... so I walked up two flights of stairs 
and 3 ADDITIONAL stairs.'

Back to business: Showing off the staples from his open heart surgery, porn legend Ron Jeremy says that doctors have now have cleared him to start having sex again

Jeremy is now recovering in a Hollywood hotel and the icon's return to health will delight fans of his larger than life character and smutty films around the world.

He says he hope to return to work - or least to light TV cameos and personal appearances - by the end of March.

On Tuesday, the porn king told the New York Daily News: 'I came very close to death. I guess I have a very, very strong will to live.'

Jeremy told the Daily News that he's lost 45 pounds since his hospitalization and is now on a strict new diet of protein, vegetables and no salt.

He was admitted to hospital after eating honey glazed donuts and admits he had 'dropped the ball' looking after his health.

It's thought that a bad diet, hypertension and sleep apnea all contributed to his condition.

'Eating healthy food is depressing, but it’s keeping me alive,' the actor said.

The famous fornicator has clearly kept 
his sense of humor following his scare: 'My dad is 94 and still going 
strong. He got mad at me for this. He jokes that he and my mom gave me 
the perfect body, and I screwed it up,' Jeremy said.

Jeremy survived a number of emergency operations after the aneurysm near his heart. He drove himself to hospital on January 29, hours before he was meant to attend his sister's wedding.

At one point he was told that that he had a 20 percent chance of dying from surgery. As he didn't have a rabbi he called pastor Craig Gross.

Gross founded XXXchurch.com, a non-profit Christian site that aims to help people with porn addiction, and Jeremy says the two have become friends.

Now he's on the road to recovery Jeremy is back to his old ways.

On Wednesday, he tweeted: 'Thank you everyone for all the get well wishes! Hope you are all having a Happy Hump Day :)'

On February 13, the prolific actor tweeted a picture giving a thumbs up to camera - with a smiling, comely nurse
 leaning over his bedside.

 accompanied the photo with the words: 'Thank you ALL for the concern 
& well wishes, I'm doing very well thanks to modern technology! - 
Ron.'

Jeremy had a heavy feeling in his chest after eating a honey-glazed donut and drove himself to the hospital on January 29.

Jeremy's
 father, Arnold Hyatt, told reporters early in the ordeal: 'Right now everything 
is in a holding pattern. He's heavily sedated and intubated.

'The 
doctors are waiting to see what develops. They anticipate it will be two
 or three days before they take him off the respirator.'

The pop culture icon has undergone two surgeries as doctors
 battle to stabilize him.

'It was an eight-hour procedure to 
begin with, and then there was some bleeding around his valves, so they 
had to go in for a second time to stop the bleeding,' Mr Hyatt, 94, told 
the New York Daily News.

Ron
 Jeremy was eating donuts at a rehearsal for a show 
based on legendary porn film Deep Throat the day before he was admitted 
to hospital.

'He has a lot of friends and his brothers close by,' Hyatt added. 'There are a lot of people praying.'

When he was once asked about an unprecedented 
career in adult entertainment that has seen him ranked No. 1 on the AVN 
Magazine's list of the 100 Top Porn Stars of all time, Jeremy remarked 
that it was his family that put him on the right path.

'I attributed that to great parents,'
 Jeremy said, bragging that he'd also remained STD-free. 'It's good 
genes and being very careful.'

The 59-year-old cult figure was due 
to have a cameo in his friend, Dave Bertolino's play about the landmark 
1970s adult movie when the high-calorie delivery arrived.

'I was trying to steer him towards 
the vegetable platter. But you know what they say about Ronnie, he never
 turns down food or work,' said Bertonlino.

Jeremy
 has appeared in more than 2,000 adult films throughout his life and 
left behind a career in teaching to become a porn star.
