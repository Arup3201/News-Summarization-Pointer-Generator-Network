It has been revealed that Prince Harry's quick two-night trip Down Under last year cost taxpayers $150,000.

Senate documents show that the Coalition spent more money looking after the royal last October, than on any other official visitor recently.

However, this is a significantly lower cost per night at around $25,000 compared to Harry's $75,000 - as the Prince was only in the country for two days.

Taxpayers funds have been used to cover other official's trips, but rarely do they cost as much as when royalty comes to town.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key was in the country for one day last October, a visit that totalled $12,000.

When Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of Burma's National League for Democracy spent five nights in Australia last November speaking at universities and The Sydney Opera House, the bill was just under $40,000.

The didn't give away exact details, but said: 'broad categories of costs for these visits could include transport (air/ground/water), accommodation, hospitality and other visit related costs.'

When Prince Harry visited, he attended the International Fleet Review, which commemorates the arrival of the original Royal Australian Navy fleet a century ago.

He also spent time with the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his family at Kirribilli House, attending a reception at the historic mansion.
