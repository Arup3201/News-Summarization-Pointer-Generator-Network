Backing a winner? Former VP candidate Sarah Palin has backed Romney for the White House

Sarah Palin held off until the eve of the 2012 presidential election to reveal that she had decided to back Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan for the White House.

The former Alaskan governor posted a lengthy message on Facebook detailing the reasons as to why she was behind the Republican candidates - and it was mostly a negative assessment of Obama's past four years.

She wrote: 'On Tuesday, please vote for Governor Mitt Romney and the commonsense conservatives running for office in your states.'

Following her failed run for vice 
president alongside John McCain in 2008, Palin has been a vocal 
commentator on the race - but has stopped short of endorsing a 
candidate.

At the primaries stage, she gave her vote to Republican hopeful and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

In
the 19-paragraph message posted on Monday, Palin launched a scathing attack on President
Obama, where she wrote: 'In 2008, Barack Obama promised to 
fundamentally transform America.

'And
for all his failures and broken promises, that’s the one thing he has 
delivered on. He’s transformed us from a nation of hope to one of 
anxiety. It doesn’t have to be this way.'

Almost 48,000 people 'liked' Palin's message on her Facebook page and it was shared close to 4,000 times.

Before now, Palin had not formally endorsed a candidate but her political action committee last week donated $5,000 to Romney's campaign.

Palin, who is currently writing a motivational fitness book, has been prolific in her Facebook posts during the 2012 campaign.

She was mired in controversy last 
month when she took to the social network to say that Obama should end 
his ‘shuck and jive shtick’ over the death of U.S. ambassador to 
Libya Chris Stevens.

The phrase has racist connotations among African-Americans and is used to denote somebody being deceitful.

She also weighed in on the VP debate 
between Paul Ryan and her adversary four years ago, Joe Biden.

Palin said 
that moderator Martha Raddatz had been 'tough' on Ryan and allowed Biden
the run of the conversation.

This Tuesday our country’s future is in our hands.

What’s past is prologue. We know what we will get from a second Obama term because we’ve all endured his first term. We know how well he kept his 2008 campaign promises. Do we really believe he’ll keep his 2012 promises?

Do we believe the word of a man who promised he wouldn’t raise taxes on the middle class, but then slammed the middle class with a massive tax hike in the form of Obamacare (and don’t forget that his own lawyers argued before the Supreme Court that the individual mandate is a tax)?

Do we really believe he won’t raise taxes even more on every American in order to pay for his wasteful spending and his crony capitalism?

Do we believe that the same president who increased the debt in his first term by more than all the first 41 presidents combined will suddenly decide to cut the deficit in his second term?

Do we believe that the president whose reckless spending led us to the first credit rating downgrade in our nation’s history will suddenly become a responsible fiscal manager if we reelect him?

Do we really believe that a president who promised us that job creation was his number one priority despite month after month of dismal job numbers now has a credible 'plan' for the job growth that eluded him for the past four years?

Do we believe that the same president who shut down the Keystone Pipeline and blocks domestic oil and natural gas development at every turn is somehow going to reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil and lead us to energy independence?

Do we really believe that our country’s national security is safe in the hands of a president whose administration denied security and assistance to our consulate under attack on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on America, and then blamed that consulate attack and the death of our ambassador on a “spontaneous” protest over an obscure YouTube video despite all the real time evidence to the contrary?

Do we believe that a president who was caught on a hot mic telling the Russian president that he would have “more flexibility” after his reelection is being honest about his plans for a second term?

We know what we will get from a second Obama term. We will get the same failed policies. We will get Obamacare locked into law without any chance of undoing this dangerous legislation and any chance to seek real patient-centered health care reform. We will get a debt crisis. We will get more inflation and higher gas prices. We will get tax increases. We will get fewer jobs. We will get more small businesses collapsing under the weight of higher taxes and unfair regulation. We will get more corruption and crony capitalism favoring the Obama administration’s friends. We will get less domestic energy development and increased dependence on terrorist sponsoring foreign regimes for our energy needs. We will get a “blame America first” foreign policy that bows to our enemies and snubs our friends like Israel and leaves America and the world less safe. We will get less opportunity and security for ourselves and for our children.

In 2008, Barack Obama promised to fundamentally transform America. And for all his failures and broken promises, that’s the one thing he has delivered on. He’s transformed us from a nation of hope to one of anxiety. It doesn’t have to be this way.

Tuesday is our chance to turn things around.

Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have offered a credible alternative to Barack Obama’s failed policies. Governor Romney understands how the free market works. His pro-growth economic policies will benefit all Americans. He has promised to move us toward energy independence, deficit reduction, and responsible entitlement reform that honors our commitment to our seniors and keeps faith with future generations. Governor Romney deserves a chance to lead. President Obama had his chance. He’s failed, and we can’t afford to go backwards.

We must also remember the many good Republican candidates who are running for the House and Senate this year. They deserve our support as well. If you are like me, you have watched these campaigns, learned about the candidates, and know where they stand despite the skewed lens of a partisan media bent on keeping liberal leadership in power. We saw the destruction a Democrat controlled White House, House, and Senate brought us after the 2008 election. Our country can’t afford that again. Your vote is the only safeguard against that happening.

On Tuesday, please vote for Governor Mitt Romney and the commonsense conservatives running for office in your states.

Voting is our duty and our right. We must never forget the immense sacrifices generations of Americans, including our brave men and women in uniform today, have made to give us this right. And we must never forget the duty we owe to generations of Americans yet to be born to exercise our right to vote prudently. The White House and control of the Senate is in the balance in this election, and every vote will count.

I firmly believe it is our responsibility to restore this country and secure the blessings of liberty and prosperity for our children, just as it was secured for us. This is our sacred duty to the past and to the future. We will succeed in this so help us God.

God bless you and God bless America.

With an Alaskan heart,

Sarah Palin
