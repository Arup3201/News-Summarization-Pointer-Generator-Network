Brits spend nearly £400m a year, more than £1m a day, on excess baggage charges at airports because they take too much on holiday.

Overloading bags with too many clothes and other possessions costs Britons a staggering £393m a year in baggage fees.

And research found that an astonishing 50 per cent of clothes and other items taken on holiday are never actually worn.

A total of 32% of women only wear half of what they take on holiday, compared to 36% of men

1. Public transport delays - 39%

2. Oversleeping - 28%

3. Disorganised/last minute packing - 26%

4. Forgetting travel date - 18%

5. Going to wrong airport terminal - 13%

6. Out of date passport - 12%

More than one in three holidaymakers wears only half of what they pack.

And one in four jet-setting Brits have to spend an average of £32.50 on extra luggage capacity, adding up to £393m a year.

Contrary to popular belief, it's men rather than women who are packing unnecessarily large amounts for holiday. 

A total of 36 per cent of men only wear half of what they take on holiday, compared to 32 percent of women. 

Travellers aged 35 to 44 years said they spend the most on extra luggage - around £33 per journey.

However, as travellers get older they get wiser on holiday baggage allowances. 43 per cent of holidaying 18 to 24 year olds wear less than half of what they pack, compared to just 21 per cent of people aged 55 or older.

The survey of 1,000 holidaymakers was commissioned by minicab booking website Kabbee.

Justin Peters, Kabbee founder, said: 'Our study is designed to remind people to plan ahead for a stress-free getaway on their holiday. 

'Extra costs for luggage can be avoided by being disciplined when packing clothing and other possessions.

'We've heard stories from our minicab drivers about passengers taking large amounts of luggage and now we know that half of it is not even being worn. 

'More than 25 percent of all bookings made via Kabbee are airport journeys, so we're keen to help to keep costs down by offering simple advice to passengers.'

It's men, not women, who are the main culprits of over-packing
