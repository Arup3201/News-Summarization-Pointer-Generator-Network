Arsene Wenger has raised a few eyebrows with his claim that Chelsea 'did not work our keeper more than we did their's' during Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

The Gunners may have had a total of 10 shot's to Chelsea's five but none of those were on target. 

Speaking during the post-match press conference: Wenger said: 'It was an even game, but at the end of the day they have financial power and used it in a effective way with players like Diego Costa and Eden Hazard making the difference.

'They did not work our keeper more than we did their's. We had more shots and missed opportunities to take more. We lost on details and this is unfortunate.'
