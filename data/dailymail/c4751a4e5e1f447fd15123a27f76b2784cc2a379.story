‘I was having agonising stomach pain and cramps,' said Denise Florance

Denise Florance worried something was seriously wrong for nearly ten years before she was finally diagnosed with womb cancer in 2012 and had to have a hysterectomy.

She says her GP had failed to take her seriously because of her weight.

‘I was having agonising stomach pain and cramps,’ says the 43-year-old mother of three from Swansea, who at her heaviest was a size 26, weighing 18 stone (she is 5ft 6in).

‘My GP told me not to worry about it: “You’re overweight, that’s all,” he said.’ 

In fact, he was right: her weight was the problem — but for far more serious reasons than they realised.

Excessive body fat is the direct cause of four out of ten cases of womb cancer, with the overweight (a body mass index, BMI, of 25 or more) at three times the risk of the disease compared with women of a healthy weight. 

These alarming figures were published last week by the World Cancer Research Fund in the journal Lancet Oncology.

A high BMI significantly raises the risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal women as well as colon cancer. It also raises the risk of pancreatic, oesophageal (gullet) and kidney cancer in men and women.

The scientists reported that 20,000 cases of cancer in Britain each year are directly linked to obesity. 

Maintaining a healthy weight would have made these cases ‘realistically avoidable’.

Britain is second highest in the world after the U.S. for the proportion of cancers attributed to obesity.

Yet quite how obesity raises the incidence of cancer is ‘the subject of fierce debate in the clinical and scientific community’, says Professor Nicholas Lemoine, director of the Barts Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University of London.

One clue may lie in the fact that overweight women are more at risk than overweight men.

A total of 13,000 women a year develop an obesity-related cancer, twice the number of men affected. 

It seems this is mainly because two female cancers lead the obesity-related league table: womb cancer and post- menopausal breast cancer.

And the female hormone oestrogen — specifically after the menopause — may be to blame.

Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries to thicken the lining of the womb in preparation for ovulation, says Adeola Olaitan, a gynaecological oncologist at University College Hospital.

‘Each month, progesterone is also produced to enable the lining of the womb to be shed during the woman’s period.’

However, oestrogen is also made in body fat in women: the more fat cells she has, then the more oestrogen she produces.

‘After menopause, women with excess body fat continue to produce high levels of oestrogen and these act on the womb lining, but without the regulating effect of progesterone.’ It’s this that’s linked to womb cancer.

High levels of post-menopausal oestrogen can also ‘stimulate abnormal breast cell growth’, which leads to more rapid development of oestrogen responsive breast cancers, says Dr Matthew Lam, senior research officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer.

This explanation is supported by major research programmes in the U.S. and Sweden since 2009, where scientists tracked obesity-related cancers in two groups of patients: one had bariatric (gastric band) surgery while the other did not.

In the Swedish study, the women with a gastric band who had lost an average of 44lb were far less likely to develop obesity-related cancer.

They lowered their risk by 42 per cent, compared with women who did not have gastric bands (and who gained an average of 3lb). This finding was replicated in the U.S.

Yet the studies reported a different pattern in men — for whom oestrogen levels are not a factor in developing cancer. They found rates of cancer were not affected by weight loss brought about by gastric bands.

Yet scientists admit they don’t understand the link between weight and cancer.

The oestrogen hypothesis doesn’t explain why 60 per cent of women with womb cancer are not obese or why a significant number — like Denise — are diagnosed before menopause.

Nor does it explain findings that before the menopause, overweight women have less risk of developing breast cancer than women with a healthy weight.

‘It seems the impact of having excess weight varies at different stages in life, but we don’t understand why,’ says Dr Lam.

What’s more, the impact of fat varies according to where it is. The extra cancer risk to women has been shown to be caused by fat distributed across the body.

Yet in men it appears to be caused by visceral belly fat — wrapped around organs in the abdomen — according to Tom Stansfeld, health information officer at Cancer Research UK.

‘Overweight men are at risk of oesophageal, rectal, colon and pancreatic cancer, affecting internal organs close to the stomach where men are most likely to carry extra pounds.

‘Fat cells secrete chemicals into the bloodstream constantly and it seems likely cancer in these organs is caused due to their proximity to visceral belly fat.’

Despite the evidence, doctors still aren’t taking seriously the risk of cancer from being fat.

Take what happened to Denise. The symptoms of abdominal pain and cramping between periods are known symptoms of womb cancer. 

Yet though she spoke to her GP twice, there was never a suggestion she should have tests.

In January 2012, she began to experience stronger cramping — ‘just like labour contractions’ — and severe pain. Two days later, she woke up in the early hours bleeding vaginally. 

‘I was terrified,’ she says.

That day, she was admitted to a gynaecological unit for tests. But once again, she says ‘it felt as though no one was taking it seriously because I’m big’.

A fortnight later, she was told she had womb cancer.

Two months on, Denise had a radical hyster-ectomy, involving removal of the womb and ovaries. She didn’t need chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

The hysterectomy brought on the menopause, causing her to have hot flushes and feel low. 

The group Womb Cancer Support UK has been a great comfort, she says. 

She has also lost two stone.

So, what’s to be done to help Denise and the thousands of people who develop cancer as a result of being overweight?

The proportion of people aware that staying a healthy weight reduces the risk of cancer 

Cancer charities stress the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle, but it may be that more radical action is needed.

Last week, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its weight-loss surgery criteria, with a call for bariatric surgery to be offered to anyone with a BMI of more than 35.

Dr Andrew Renehan, of the Department of Surgery in the School of Cancer and Imaging Sciences at Manchester University, welcomes the surgery recommendation as a proven method of reducing the risk of obesity-related cancers for women.

‘The obesity epidemic is not abating. 

'We now have proof that for women we can reverse the effect of obesity on cancer risk,’ he says.
