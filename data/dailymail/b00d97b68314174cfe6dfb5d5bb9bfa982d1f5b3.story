Four of Jenny McCarthy’s celebrity guests at a star-studded
fundraiser over the weekend were slapped with citations for public
intoxication.

The 40-year-old was the emcee at a Dancing With The Stars
event on Saturday at the Hotel Baker in St. Charles, Illinois, to benefit a
local children’s school.

But some of her attendees - including her sister Joanne
McCarthy, General Hospital star Kelly Monaco and professional dancer Serge Onik
- are said to have hit up some of the bars in the area after the event,
resulting in a run-in with local police.

The trio of celebrities were joined by Monaco’s beau Heath
Freeman as they patronised a bar called EvenFlow.

Joanne, according to police reports obtained by the Kane County
Chronicle, told law enforcement that she and her friends arrived at the
bar at 1.45am for an ‘after-hours’ party.

They indulged in alcoholic beverages according to Joanne -
who is a former pro basketball player - until police arrived at 5.45am where
the group had moved outside once the establishment had closed.

The official police report says that Monaco, 37, was
belligerent to the officers on the scene as she: ‘Repeatedly stated she was a
celebrity on the television shows General Hospital and Dancing With the Stars.’

But the actress’ behaviour changed once law enforcement
notified her of the possible ramifications if she were to continue behaving in a
confrontational way with officers.

The owner of the establishment told law enforcement he had
been serving the group well past the legal cut-off of 2am because he wanted to ‘accommodate some famous
people and made a poor choice for his business.’

Jenny is not mentioned in the police report and was
apparently not involved in the incident.

But the star was most likely tied up with her hosting duties for the DWTS red carpet affair, which was billed as a night of dinner and dancing to benefit the Bridges Academy in St. Charles.

Meanwhile, Jenny has been busy lately.

In July, she was named a permanent co-host of ABC's the View, replacing controversial conservative Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

'I'm beyond thrilled to be joining Barbara and the other amazing women at the table,' said Jenny in a statement.

'I look forward to helping make hot topics a little bit hotter, and showing my mom that my interrupting skills have finally paid off.'

Her relationship with Donnie has also been heating up.

The steamy couple reportedly hit it off when he appeared on her VH1 talk show.

'Do you talk dirty while you're having sex?' Jenny asked during the innuendo-filled segment.

He replied, 'I do,' then appeared to giggle and whisper into her ear.

Jenny wrote on her blog: 'Let’s just say we visually give 50 Shades of Grey a run for its money.

'It gets steamy. I mean like really steamy. Being turned on by a guy is always fun but to have it legitimately happen to you on TV is to be turned back into a 12-year-old. By the time we get into the groundbreaking interview, my face turns fifty shades of RED.'
