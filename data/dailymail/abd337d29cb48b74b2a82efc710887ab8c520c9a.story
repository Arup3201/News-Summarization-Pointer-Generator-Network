Paul Cullinan, the voice behind Bungle, will appear on The Voice on Saturday

One of the characters from cult children's show Rainbow has made an unexpected TV comeback on BBC talent show The Voice.

Child's entertainer Paul Cullinan played large furry bear Bungle in the classic ITV series, alongside much-loved puppets Zippy and George.

But on Saturday, Bungle's alter-ego will reappear on TV for the first time in almost 25 years - as a contestant on the singing show.

However, when he reveals to judges that he has previously starred on Rainbow, just one of the four knew what he was talking about.

It falls to Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson to explain to his fellow judges - will.i.am, Rita Ora and Sir Tom Jones - that he was 'a slightly camp bear called Bungle'.

During the audition, due to air on Saturday, Ricky adds: 'There was a guy called Geoffrey who lived in a house with a pink hippo, a thing, I don't know what he was, called Zippy, with a zip for a mouth.' 

Neither Rita, 24, nor Sir Tom Jones, 74, know anything about the programme.

'I haven't seen it, obviously I had a rubbish childhood,' said the former. 

will.i.am then grabs his iPad and finds the Rainbow theme tune, encouraging the studio audience to sing along.

Cullinan, 48, was the last of three actors to play Bungle in the hit show, which ran from 1972 to 1992.

Geoffrey Hayes, now 74, struggled to find work after the show ended and took a job as a shelf stacker before becoming a taxi driver.

This year, UKIP's deputy leader Paul Nuttall was also forced to deny that he starred as Bungle in Rainbow after an internet prank. The fourth series of The Voice starts on BBC1 on Saturday.

Of the four new judges, only Ricky Wilson recognised the children's programme. American will.i.am (left) was understandably in the dark, while Rits Ora, 24, and Sir Tom Jones (right), said they didn't remember it 

David Cook (presenter)

Cook, 74, presented the first and second series of Rainbow. He went on to write two novels about a boy with learning disabilities called Walter. A radio play in 2009 saw Walter become a pensioner.

Geoffrey Hayes (presenter)

Hayes, 72, who joined Rainbow in the third series, found it difficult to find work after the show was dropped by ITV in 1992 - and even stacked supermarket shelves, before becoming a taxi driver.

John Leeson (Bungle)

Leeson is best known for voicing K-9 in Doctor Who in the 1970s and 1980s. He has since voiced the character again in various spin-offs, and has also served as a magistrate. He is now 71.

Stanley Bates (Bungle)

Bates, who played Bungle from 1973 to 1988, was bound over to keep the peace by magistrates in 2001 after appearing on a charge of assaulting a mother in a 'road rage' incident. At the time of the court case he was said to have become a self-employed lighting manufacturer. He is now 73.

Malcolm Lord (Bungle)

Lord, 59, who worked on Rainbow from 1980 to 1989, has recently performed on stage in Aladdin, Dick Whittington and Calendar Girls. He is actively involved in his local community in Shropshire.

George and Zippy: Roy Skelton, who died in 2011 aged 79,  also wrote many of the scripts for Rainbow

Peter Hawkins (Zippy)

Policeman's son Hawkins, who also voiced the Daleks in Doctor Who, died aged 82 in July 2006 – but was perhaps most well-known for his gibberish language in Bill and Ben the Flowerpot Men.

Roy Skelton (Zippy and George)

Skelton also voiced the Daleks in Doctor Who from 1967 to 1988, as well as the Cybermen and the Krotons. He also wrote many of the scripts for Rainbow. Skelton died in June 2011 aged 79.
