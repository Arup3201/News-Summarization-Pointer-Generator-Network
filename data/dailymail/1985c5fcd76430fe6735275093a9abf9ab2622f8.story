Shocking footage released by West Yorkshire firefighters shows one of their crew being deliberately pelted with fireworks.

The incident occurred in the Chapeltown area of Leeds as West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service members extinguished a small street fire.

As one of the firefighters prepared to douse the flames he was attacked by a group of people as they emerge from a side street.

Blaze: As the fireworks explode the fireman turns his back and tries to shield himself from the ball of flame

West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service decided to release the footage to show the public the incredible danger they occasionally encounter during bonfire season.

The video shows the fire engine driving through streets, skirting small fires that crews had been called to put out. 

The vehicle then pulls up to one fire and the camera shows a firefighter getting out and preparing to extinguish the blaze.

But before he can do so, a man on the other side of the street can be seen firing rockets at the fire engine.

As the fireworks begin to go off, the street is filled with multi-coloured bursts of flame and fire.

Noise: There is considerable noise as the fireworks bang and they subsequently light up the street

A spokesperson for the fire service said: 'This shocking footage from our silent witness cameras, installed on all fire engines, shows in graphic detail what our crews sometimes face over the bonfire season.

'This incident, on November 8, 2013, shows crews attending an incident in the Chapeltown area of Leeds where fireworks are directed at them.'

During the video the fireman can be seen attending the scene as the silhouettes of four young adolescents appear in the background.

Moments later three of the adolescents run away while the remaining adolescent unleashes the 'bonfire season rocket attack' on the unfortunate firefighter.
