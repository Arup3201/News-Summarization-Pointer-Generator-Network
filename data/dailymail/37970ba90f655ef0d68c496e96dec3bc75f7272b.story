Taking no part: Philipp Bonhoeffer, a world renowned children's heart doctor, has withdrawn from a disciplinary hearing into allegations he sexually abused young boys while working for a charity in Kenya

A world renowned children's heart doctor has withdrawn from a disciplinary hearing into allegations he sexually abused young boys.

Philipp Bonhoeffer is alleged to have committed the abuse against several boys under the age of 16 during visits to Kenya with the medical charity Chain of Hope.

But with a hearing set to start on September 3, the former head of cardiology at Great Ormond Street children's hospital has broken off all contact with the General Medical Council (GMC).

The GMC has been told he will not attend the hearing and will not be legally represented, meaning he will relinquish his right to cross-examine a key witness in the case.

If found guilty at the hearing, he could be struck off the medical register.

Chain of Hope provides treatment to children in the developing world who have serious heart problems. As well as chairing its medical board, Professor Bonhoeffer sponsored a number of youths in Kenya.

The GMC alleges that the professor 'abused his positionÂ  of trust when he behaved in a way which was sexually motivated, inappropriate, and misleading towards several boys under 16' during his work with the charity.

It also alleges that he provided gifts and financial support to other children and young adults and organised for them to stay with him.

The GMC also alleges that he contacted the key witness - Witness A - and attempted to persuade them to withdraw the allegations.

The 50-year-old strongly denies all of the allegations against him.

The case against Professor Bonhoeffer was opened by the GMC in October 2010.

Because of the seriousness of the allegations against him, and because 
his work gave him access to children, he was suspended from the medical 
register pending its outcome.

He won an appeal last year against the GMC nine months after it had opened its case against him.

He claimed the GMC's plan to rely on hearsay evidence from Witness A would prevent him from getting a fair trial.

However, the GMC has since reopened the case and the witness will give evidence in person at a new hearing due to start on September 3.

This has resulted in Professor Bonhoeffer pulling out of the hearing all together.

According to the Independent, his lawyers RadcliffesLeBrasseur told the GMC that their client 'intends to take no further part' in the proceedings.

He stopped seeing patients at Great Ormond Street in April 2009.

Professor Bonhoeffer is a great nephew of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the renowned theologian. In 2000, he performed the world's first heart-valve transplant conducted via a catheter inserted in the groin .
