On the shore of Lake Jackson in Manassas, Virginia, stands an imposing villa built by a high-ranking government official, which played a mysterious role during the Cold War as a secret refuge for defecting Russian spies.

The luxury mansion called Alvictus is currently on the market for $749,000. It was built in the late 50s by Victor Purse, a well-connected and cunning State Department official who counted among his friends presidents and kings.

After moving to Florida in the 1970s, Purse rented his secluded, plush home to the Central Intelligence Service to be used as a safe house where so-called ‘illegals’ from the Soviet Union were tucked away.

The waterfront home at 11625 Purse Drive has three bedrooms and three bathrooms, 4,654 square feet, a swimming pool, an outdoor bar and a large patio for entertainment. The sale is being handled by realtors Dwayne and Maryanne Moyers, who thoroughly researched the property's history.

The most impressive part of the high-end home is its shadowy past.

Alvitcus is every inch the brainchild of its first owners, Victor Purse, who served as State Department Deputy Chief of Protocol between 1954 and 1957, and his first wife, Alice.

The name of the mansion is an acronym combining the first few letters of the Purses’ given names with 'US' tacked on.

During his years in the State Department, Purse, who by nature was charismatic, became known for his impressive connections that included foreign dignitaries and heads of state.

The protocol official, then in his late 30s, came to know Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip while arranging their departure home after an official visit. He was even invited to stay in Buckingham Palace in England.

Fit for a king: Alvictus was originally a small lakeside log cabin called Happy House, but Mr Purse and his wife transformed it into a luxury lakefront retreat suitable for hosting foreign dignitaries

'P' for perfect: The koi fish pond on the landscaped property in the shape of the letter 'P'

High and mighty: The luxury home was the setting for glamorous parties, one of which was attended by  Attorney General and later Senator Bobby Kennedy

Out of sight: Purse, who had connections in the government after his retirement, decided that his home was perfect to be used as a CIA safe house because it was secluded

Decades later, Queen Elizabeth would send Purse a china set as a wedding gift and even embrace him in public during a reception.

Purse also became good friends with Saudi Arabia's King Saud, who invited him to go back with him to the Middle East and stay in his palace.

The deputy protocol chief’s propensity for rubbing elbows with the high and mighty was irritating to his superior, Protocol Chief Wiley T. Buchanan, who grumbled about his deputy's glamorous friends.   

The final straw for Buchanan came in 1957, when then-39-year-old Purse, who considered President Dwight Eisenhower a father figure of sorts, was invited to fly from New York City to Washington DC on the presidential plane.

After a public confrontation in the airport between Purse and his boss, who was forced to fly commercial, the deputy was ousted from the protocol office and transferred to an administrative position within the State Department.

Two years later, Purse and his then-wife, Alice, were on the market for a lakefront home.

The couple became interested in Manassas, Virginia, after hearing of a local real estate developer who was charged with murder.

Impressive setting: The formal dining room sitting six with a crystal chandelier over the dining table is overlooking Lake Jackson

Plenty of space: The 4,654-square-foot Alvictus features a two-story great room with 18-foot ceilings

Plush setting: The sun room is in the in-law suite accessible through the living room of the great house

Warm and toasty: The massive family room comes with heated blue slate stone floor perfect for cold Virginia winters

The opportunistic Purse learned which properties the realtor, Luther Alpaugh, owned, and chose the best location, which at the time featured a one-room log cabin dubbed Happy House.

The Purses went to work expanding the small bungalow and turning it into a lavish mansion with 18-foot ceilings where they could entertain their guests, among them U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

The couple also added a patio, a pool, observation decks and a fountain with a large water wheel in the middle.

After retiring from the State Department in the mid-70s, Mr Purse was living part time in Florida and decided to rent the secluded mansion hidden from view by high fences and neighboring homes to the CIA.

Long-time residents of Manassas still remember seeing Purse's shady tenants speaking a foreign language in the local country store.

Purse was kept in the dark about much of what was going on at Alvictus while it was being rented out by the U.S. government. But he did reveal to Katherine Peters, who bought the mansion from him in 1983, that he knew the identity of one of the Russian secret agents who called the lakefront estate home for a while.

When asked if any other noteworthy house guests Purse stated: ‘Robert Kennedy was out here once. That’s all I can say about it.’

Alvictus changed hands twice since the 80s. It is currently owned by John Rutledge and Jerry Lamp, who had bought the house in 2002 from Larry Lomax, an international antiques dealer to celebrities, congressional members, movie stars, and millionaires.
