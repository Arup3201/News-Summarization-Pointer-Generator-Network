She's the fiery Foreign Affairs Minister whose popularity has doubled in recent times, ranking her on par with the Prime Minister as the preferred Liberal leader.

But the real reason for the popularity boost became clear on Sunday night when Julie Bishop showed the Twitter-sphere just how hip she could be. 

For three hours, Ms Bishop entertained her 85,000 Twitter followers by replying in nothing but emojis.

The reason for Julie Bishop's spike in popularity became clear over Twitter on Sunday night 

The Foreign Affairs Minister spent three hours entertaining her 85,000 Twitter followers by replying in nothing but emojis

Beginning just before 7pm, she began by replying to a Tweet that she was tagged in, with a digital icon of dancing girls.

After a prompt from Fairfax journalist Ben Cubby, who exclaimed that the Foreign Minister 'sure does lover her emojis', there was simply no stopping Ms Bishop who replied with a single 'cool' caricature – a smiley face wearing a pair of sunglasses.

From there, the requests proceeded to roll in, pushing the Foreign Affairs Minister to see just how far she'd take the joke.

'Fully expecting @JulieBishopMP to deliver her next address to the united nations entirely in emoji,' kimjongeuan wrote, to which Ms Bishop swiftly replied with a row of emojis including a plane, the statue of liberty and a speaking face.

Lycanzayn then tried their luck, asking '@JulieBishopMP send me an emoji story Julie please'.

Again, Ms Bishop replied with a row of pictures including a plane and a biscuit.

The jokes continued on until just after 11pm when the Foreign Minister, perhaps knackered from keeping up with today's youth, wrote 'iPhone has been wrested off me - no more (crying face) Time for (zzz emoji) good (moon) Twitter'.

The Tweets proved enough to win over one social media user, who replied 'I reckon you be a great prime minster, I hope you'll be in power one day'. 

Ms Bishop's emoji tirade was certainly not the strangest behaviour ever displayed by a politician over Twitter, however.

Earlier in the month, federal member for parliament Michael Danby stumped his social media followers by posting ten consecutive cat memes to his Twitter page with no captions or explanations.

While initially sparking rumours that his account had been hacked by a humourless Twitter troll, a spokesperson from his office soon revealed that the MP, who 'has a very keen and quirky sense of humour', was himself responsible for the stream of cat memes.
