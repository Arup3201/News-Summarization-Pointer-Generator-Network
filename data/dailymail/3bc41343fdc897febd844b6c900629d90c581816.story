Supermarkets are gearing up for sunglasses, barbeque food and ice cream to fly off the shelves as Britain gears up for its hottest day of the year so far tomorrow.

Although some areas of the UK have endured April showers so far today, spring looks as though it may finally have arrived as parts of the UK will see the mercury hit 20C on Sunday.

The South East looks set to bask in sunshine tomorrow, with the highest temperatures expected in East Anglia.

Weather in the North and West is set to remain wet and cloudy, but temperatures will still be in double figures, with highs of 14C.

People have so far been making the most of the weather, with tourists enjoying a punt on the River Cam in Cambridge, and four-year-old Kadie Lane enjoying the sunshine in Shiremoor, North Tyneside.

Rachel Vince, a forecaster at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'Much of the UK will start off dry today, but there will be some rain in Devon and Cornwall first thing.

'That's going to spread north-eastwards over the course of the day, and winds will strengthen, with only the north of Scotland set to stay fine.'

But tonight should be frost-free and temperatures in much of England and Wales will not fall below 10C (50F), she said.

Ms Vince added: 'The south-east of England will be predominantly fine tomorrow, with sunshine, but the north and west of the UK can expect clouds and showers.'

Supermarkets are bracing themselves for an increased demand for ice cream and barbecue meats on the hottest weekend of the year, with Asda predicting a 50 per cent surge in sales of sunglasses.

Ms Vince said ice-cream vendors might anticipate brisk trade in the south east - but it could be too early for families elsewhere to pack picnic hampers.

Next week will bring an 'unsettled spell of spring weather' with bands of rain and showers moving across the UK, she added. But it will be drier at times in the South and East, with sunshine at times.

Temperatures finally began to rise after a long and bitterly cold winter

The better weather comes as some of those worst affected by freak weather conditions this winter return home four months after they had to abandon their properties due to flooding.

Around 420 homes were wrecked by floodwater in St Asaph, Denbighshire, back in November, and many residents are only just returning to their homes now.
