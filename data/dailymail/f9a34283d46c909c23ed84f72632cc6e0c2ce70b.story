A man who tripped and cut his neck on broken glass was minutes from death after he lost more than five pints of blood.

Letting agent Kevin Jones, 50, stumbled and smashed a glass of water on his desk before puncturing a vein in his neck on a shard.

The father-of-two slipped into unconscious and would have died if a colleague had not arrived at work ten minutes early.

Lucky escape: Kevin Jones lost more than five pints of blood after tripping and injuring himself on broken glass

Mr Jones, from Swindon in Wiltshire, said: 'I tripped over and twisted to avoid chinning myself on the bin and unfortunately landed on the broken glass.

'I tried to phone for an ambulance but I kept getting the number wrong.

'I tried to get out but I kept slipping up and I was feeling weak.'

Mr Jones, owner of letting agents Martin & Co in Swindon, was found unconscious by colleague Kelly Hutchinson, who had arrived at work ten minutes early.

He added: 'I didn’t have that much blood left by the time she got here. I had lost about three litres [more than five pints], which is an awful lot.

'It was just like a puncture wound, which was fortunately into a vein and not an artery.

'There was an awful lot of blood, but there wasn’t anything I could do about it.

'The hospital staff said I was lucky to be alive. Everybody said I had been very lucky to be found by Kelly in time.'

Miss Hutchinson, 22, arrived at work at 8.20am - half-an-hour after Mr Jones injured himself.

The lettings negotiator said: 'I saw the glass and thought he had gone to get a broom. I loaded up my computer but he still wasn’t back.

'I thought "surely he knows where the broom is". I opened the back door and he was lying unconscious on the floor.

'I came back into the office and phoned for an ambulance.

'When he was in intensive care the nurse said to me I had saved his life and I cried.'

Mr Jones made a full recovery after surgery at Swindon's Great Western Hospital following his lucky escape on May 28.

His wife Amparo said: 'Kelly was an absolute angel through the day and beyond - we will eternally be indebted to her.'
