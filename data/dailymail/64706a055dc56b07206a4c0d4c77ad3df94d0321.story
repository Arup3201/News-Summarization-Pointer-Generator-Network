A burglar carried out a string of 30 burglaries because he could not face his 'boring' life and needed to steal cars to get a 'kick' out of joyriding, a court has heard.

Layabout teenager Ryan Legge, 19, looted victims’ homes for pleasure after he decided he wanted to 'alleviate' his humdrum life.

In a two-year crime spree he targeted properties with unlocked doors or open windows, usually when the occupants were asleep in bed or watching TV.

In many cases he also stole the household car using keys left on open view.

Jobless Legge was arrested after his fingerprints were found on property stolen from a home in Royton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester.

He later claimed he was motivated into burglary by the 'need to alleviate boredom' rather than to fund a luxury lifestyle. He claimed his criminal behaviour was 'grafting'.

Pictures on Legge's Facebook page showed him posing with champagne and vodka and others 
showed him bare-chested and flexing his muscles and posing with a 
glamorous female friend.

Today, victims of Legge reacted with anger to his excuses after he was locked away for four years at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester.

He had earlier pleaded guilty to two charges of burglary and a further count of taking a vehicle without consent, and asked for 34 other offences to be taken into consideration - 28 of them burglaries.

Post office worker Trish Clune, 46, who had her Vauxhall Astra stolen in a raid on her home in Chadderton, Oldham, said after the hearing: 'I think his excuse is disgusting. I have never been burgled before and it was absolutely terrible.

'These people want their fingers chopped off. If they are that bored then go and find a job like most folk - not rob people’s houses. My son is 20 and he has a job. It was devastating - it took me a long time to get over it.'

She added: 'This boy and his mate took the Vauxhall Astra and also the keys for the other two cars and then they tried to return for those.

'It’s incredible to think they had the cheek to come back round the corner afterwards. It’s just lucky someone saw them and they ran off.

'Being burgled is a horrible experience and the worst bit is not necessarily having something taken. It’s the fact we had an intruder invading our house. To say he was bored is no excuse whatsoever.'

Earlier the court heard how during the burglary spree householders were wakened in the early hours to find they had been burgled.

At one at a house a Citroen C4 was stolen and the homeowners knew nothing of the break-in until the next morning.

In one raid on the home of a couple, their son-in-law who lived opposite spotted two men in the garden, one filling a bag with bottles of champagne and spirits.

A pug dog valued at more than £1,300 was also stolen but later recovered. In mitigation for Legge his counsel Ben Knight said his client got a 'kick' of joyriding in stolen vehicles which were always recovered undamaged.

Mr Knight added: 'He was motivated by a need to alleviate boredom rather than to fund an extravagant lifestyle. The houses were not ransacked and the methods of breaking in were opportunistic and unsophisticated.'

Legge’s accomplice Alex Riley, 22, was found guilty by a jury of two charges of burglary and two offences of taking vehicles without consent. He was also jailed for four years.

Both men were each ordered to pay £120 victim surcharges.

Judge Jeffrey Lewis told them: 'You’re not afraid of entering houses at night when they are occupied yet you have not got the faintest idea of the devastation that can be caused by your actions.

'You both have formidable records and are seriously at risk of spending a great deal of your adult lives in custody.'

Legge’s family have since moved out of their home in the Fitton Hill area of Oldham. A neighbour said: 'They weren’t here that long but it sounds like we are well rid.’
