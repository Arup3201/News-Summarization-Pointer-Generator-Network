It transmitted data back to earth for just 14.5 second before everything 'went dark.'

But now incredible pictures from Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter [MRO] have revealed the site and possible remains of the Soviet Mars 3 Lander that arrived, and then seemingly disappeared, on the Red Planet in 1971.

The MRO has been orbiting Mars since 2006, taking a host of photos  - and now Russian enthusiasts believe it may have captured the landing site of the doomed space vehicle.

Proof? These high-resolution images reveal a bright object on Mars that's about 25 feet, the right size to be the main parachute for the Mars 3 lander

Still out there? The Mars 3 landing capsule (not actual model), which only transmitted data for 14.5 seconds, may have been re-discovered

Although it is too early to say definitively it is the Mars 3 Lander, stills taken from 2007 appear to have captured the heatshield, retrorocket and parachute of the machine.

The pictures were pored over by a group of Russian space fans, led by Vitaliy Egorov, who told Sky & Telescope: 'When I suggested that our group begin searches, 15 or 20 people responded.

'We examined all of the picture but didn't find the lander — enthusiasm quickly died away.'

But on New Year's Eve last year, Egorov struck gold, as he finally spotted elements of the Mars 3 Lander.

'I think of it as a gift from Santa Claus or the Russian Father Frost,' he added.

Found: This set of images shows what might be hardware from the Soviet Union's 1971 Mars 3 lander, seen in a pair of images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera

Rescue mission: These two marks, although questionable to the naked eye, are believed to be parts of the Soviet Union's failed Mars Lander 3's mission to the Red Planet

The discovery was shared with scientists, who contacted the MRO team in order to take a follow-up shot of the debris, and the high resolution camera confirmed the findings.

The layout and the way the fixtures are on the surface seem to acknowledge that it is the Lander, however, further study is being undertaken to understand the 3-dimensional shapes and rule out any other explanation.

While the Mars Lander 3 transmitted for less than 15 seconds, it was still better than the Soviet Union's two later efforts.

The Mars 6 and the Mars 7 were both launched in 1973, but both failed.

The U.S. Viking Lander, which arrived on Mars in 1976, is credited as being the first successful landing on the Red Planet.

Next step is to research the 3-dimensional aspects of the finds to determine absolute proof
