Ovarian cancer patient Maria Cull, 58, from Herts

After eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy over seven years, ovarian cancer patient Maria Cull is still holding out for a cure.

Maria, 58, a former sales administrator, was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007 but the cancer has since spread to her lungs, liver, kidneys and bowel. Two weeks ago, she was told that the last type of chemotherapy available to her had stopped working.

'I'm running out of options,' says Maria, who lives in Hemel Hempstead, Herts, with her husband, Ian, 56, a civil engineer. 'The gaps between treatment cycles were getting shorter and shorter as the cancer keeps returning.'

Her hopes are pinned on a groundbreaking new trial combining two cancer drugs to target blood supply to tumours, destroying them, then stopping them from regrowing.

The two drugs, which have not been used together before, are fosbretabulin and pazopanib. Fosbretabulin is one of a class of drugs known as a vascular disruptive agent (VDA) and destroys the blood cells supplying existing cancer cells. Pazopanib, which is licensed for kidney cancer, prevents the development of new blood vessels.

Maria's consultant, Professor Gordon Rustin of the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, in Middlesex, one of the experts leading the trial, says he is 'very optimistic' about the outcome. 'The blood supply is the Achilles heel of a tumour; if you can shut that down they will shrink and be destroyed,' says Professor Rustin, who for 30 years has worked on drugs that attack blood vessels that supply tumours.

'Fosbretabulin has been around since 1998 and was developed from chemicals extracted from African bush willow bark. We know it is highly effective at destroying the blood supply to tumours.'

However, Professor Rustin says the drug on its own is not enough to stop the cancer coming back, as some cells on the rim of the tumour survive and are able to develop a new blood supply, getting nutrients from surrounding healthy tissue. This means the tumour grows back, usually within months.

'We can treat women with ovarian cancer who relapse five or six times - the first period of remission is typically a year or more - but each time they relapse the period of remission get shorter. Some individuals survive for many more cycles of treatment - the record is 22.'

Eventually though, as in Maria's case, the drugs stop working. 'We have been searching for another drug to use with fosbretabulin, to stop cancer cells growing a new blood supply, for several years.

'An earlier small trial we did using it in conjunction with Avastin, a drug that works in a similar way to pazopanib, was successful and we have been trying to get a larger randomised, controlled trial running for some time.'

She has had eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy and is still holding out for a cure

Experts believe that pazopanib will work even better than Avastin, and has the advantage of being taken as a pill (Avastin is given intravenously).

Maria, who has three children and two grandchildren, hopes to start treatment this month in the first phase of the new trial. The aim is to find the optimum dose and what side-effects the combination produces. A further 17 patients will be recruited at Mount Vernon, the Christie Hospital in Manchester and the Royal Marsden Hospital in London.

Phase two, involving 120 patients, will start recruiting in 2015, comparing the combination treatment with pazopanib alone. 'I'm still optimistic about that magic pill,' says Maria, who has already been on four previous drugs trials. It's hoped the new drug combination will improve survival rates for ovarian cancer in the same way new drug therapies have done for breast cancer.

Despite being the second most common gynaecological cancer, with 7,000 women diagnosed every year, the survival rate for ovarian cancer is still low. Only 42.9 per cent of women with the disease are alive after five years - compared with 85 per cent with breast cancer. Experts say this is partly because the majority of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed only when patients have symptoms when the cancer has spread.

However, treatment options are also more limited.

Maria was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in March 2007 after she started to feel full after a few mouthfuls of food - a key symptom of the disease. Others are nausea, persistent bloating and abdominal pain.

'I felt like I'd eaten a seven-course meal but usually I'd only eaten half a plateful,' she says. At first, Maria thought it was her irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) flaring up.

It was a nurse performing a routine cervical smear test a year after Maria's symptoms began who urged her to see a doctor. 'I mentioned that I'd been experiencing pain during sex recently and she suggested I see my GP.'

Maria's doctor noted her right ovary was enlarged and said it might be a cyst. Blood tests also showed raised levels of something called CA125, a marker for ovarian cancer, 'though I didn't know that at the time', she says.

She was then sent for an ultrasound scan, which confirmed there was a growth. She was told she needed surgery to investigate. 'The nurse in the room put her arm on my shoulder, but still no one mentioned the word cancer,' recalls Maria. 

'It's bought me this precious extra time'

'So when the surgeon I was referred to warned me that all the signs pointed to ovarian cancer, the news really shocked me. I was just 50 and had never had any serious health problems before. But I tried to stay positive.'

Surgery confirmed it was cancer. Maria had tumours on her right and left ovary. Although the cancer hadn't spread beyond the womb, the tumour looked aggressive, so the surgeon removed her womb and ovaries. She then underwent four-and-a-half months of chemotherapy.

Maria went into remission for three years. 'I went back to work and had a completely normal life - I hoped I was one of the lucky ones who had been cured.'

But in August 2010, Maria developed pain in her left side - the cancer had returned, this time in her pelvis. 'It was obviously devastating but the doctors were so calm that I just got on with it,' she says. The cancer was controlled with the hormone treatment tamoxifen as well as regular scans and blood tests to monitor it, before Maria moved on to her second bout of chemotherapy in July 2011. She has since had six more rounds.

Late last year, Maria took part in a trial of a new drug that could potentially make her responsive again to carboplatin, one of the main chemotherapy drugs, as it had stopped working for her. 'My lowest point came last Christmas when I was on the trial drug plus two other chemotherapy drugs,' she recalls. 'I had to spend Christmas Day in bed in hospital as I was so ill.

'The trial drug worked, though, and made me respond to carboplatin again. By February, I felt much better, and in May we had a holiday in Antigua.'

Sadly, that treatment has stopped working again, and Maria was switched to another chemotherapy regimen. Two weeks ago, she was told that drug had also failed.

'People wonder why I have persevered with chemotherapy for so long because it obviously has side-effects, which have made me extremely ill at times.'

She adds: 'But it's bought me this precious extra time and I've made the most of it - going on holiday, seeing my daughter and younger son marry and my grandchildren born.

'I'm amazed that however black things might look, my specialists always have a plan for the next step and something else we can try. Because of them, I've never given up hope.

'Even if this trial drug combination doesn't work for me I hope the research will help other women with ovarian cancer and other cancer patients. For me, that means it has to be worth a shot.'

Commenting on the new trial, Louise Bayne, chief executive at the charity Ovacome, says: 'Ovarian cancer remains an incredibly difficult disease to cure. Sadly, we lose 4,800 women to the disease each year. We sincerely hope this trial is successful and that it provides some long-awaited hope for women and their loved ones.'
