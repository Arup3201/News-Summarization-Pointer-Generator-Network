Jailed: Tyrone Powell was sentenced to two years in prison after his friend Carlo Renzi fell from the roof of his car

A drunk driver who 'accidentally killed' his best friend who he 'loved like a brother' when a prank went wrong has been jailed for two years.

Father-of-four Carlo Renzi, 31, from Swansea died when he fell from the roof of his friend's car after the pair had spent the afternoon drinking.

Swansea Crown Court heard Tyrone Powell, 27, was driving near a pub in Port Tennant when Mr Renzi jumped onto the roof of his Ford Fiesta, a practise known as 'car surfing'.

Mr Renzi was unable to hold on and he fell off, later dying of his injuries.

His wife, Claire, who was in the car when the accident happened on November 12, said the pair were 'clowning around'.

She
 said: 'It was silly and foolish. It was a stupid prank that went wrong.
 Carlo was a clown. He loved clowning around, that's how he was.'

The court was told that Mr Renzi and 
Powell had consumed around six pints that afternoon during a drinking 
session in Port Tennant.

Mrs Renzi said her husband did not seem drunk but said he was 'full of life'.

The two friends began play fighting through the window of Powell's car before he began to slowly drive away.

Mrs Renzi said she did not know her husband had jumped onto the roof and Powell later told police he 'panicked' after seeing Mr Renzi, a former Welsh Guard, clinging onto the roof.

After hearing a 'thud' he stopped the car and ran to his friend. He held him as Mrs Renzi ran to the pub to get help. Mr Renzi was pronounced dead at 8.28pm.

Powell pleaded guilty to careless driving while under the influence of alcohol.

His
 barrister John Hipkin said: 'The defendant and Carlo were the best of 
friends. He wouldn't have set out to hurt Carlo deliberately because he 
loved him like a brother.

'They were always joking together. This was a joke, which as Claire Renzi said, went tragically wrong.

'This is a defendant who acknowledges the pain that he has caused to the family in question.

'There's nothing he can do to turn the clock back and bring his best friend back to those who loved him.'

Judge Huw Davies QC said the case was one of the most 'unusual' he had come across.

He banned Powell from driving for two years and jailing him for two years.

He said: 'No sentence of imprisonment, whatever its length, could possibly reflect the tragedy of loss and hurt which the family of the deceased have experienced.

'They (the sentences) do not in any way reflect the tragedy of loss or the significance of the loss of Carlo Renzi to those who are his nearest and dearest.'
