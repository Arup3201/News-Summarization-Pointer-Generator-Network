Gordon Brown wanted 30 would-be Labour MPs to stand down at the last election, in the hope of cutting a deal with the Liberal Democrats.

The embattled prime minister suggested to aides they make way for Nick Clegg’s party in marginal seats to stop the Tories getting in, a new book claims.

But the plan was rejected by his inner circle, who said the Lib Dems would not agree to an alliance. The scheme is detailed in ‘Five Days in May’ by former Labour minister Lord Adonis.

Deal: The prime minister Gordon Brown wanted 30 would-be Labour MPs to stand down to make way for Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrat representatives

It tells of the inner turmoil of the Labour Party in the run-up to the creation of the Coalition.

It says that on Friday May 7, the day after polling day, a ‘crestfallen’ Mr Brown learned of the Tory gains as he jetted in to Stansted airport from his constituency.

Lord Adonis wrote: ‘When mobiles were switched on as the plane taxied to a stand…the bad news was uppermost.

‘A Tory swathe was being cut through the East and West Midlands and southern England. A succession of Lib Dems were also falling to the Tories. It looked to be slipping away after all.

‘GB himself looked crestfallen – ‘the only time I remember him like this in the whole election’, said one aide. ‘Our problem is that the Liberals are just too weak against the Tories’, Gordon said to me on the phone as his convoy left Stansted.

Silence: It became clear Gordon Brown's plan may have fallen though when Danny Alexander refused to return calls to himself and Peter Mandelson, Lord Adonis writes

‘I always knew this would be our big problem which is why I wanted to do that deal with them’, he added. He was referring to his pre-election idea of standing Labour candidates down in 30 Lib-Dem-Conservative marginal, a suggestion rebuffed strongly by his campaign team.’

Lord Adonis said his boss was keen to make a swift overture to Nick Clegg to form a pact which would have given the two parties 315 seats - short of an overall majority of 326 but with the support of smaller parties on crucial votes.

Mr Brown told his team: ‘We’ve got to get
 this going with the Liberals – there’ s got to be movement today and 
something settled over the weekend or Cameron will simply take 
possession.’

But the Lib Dems were not forthcoming. Lord Adonis, who wanted to make a deal, wrote of an ‘ominous silence’ on the first day.

‘Danny Alexander hadn’t got back to Peter or me with any suggested first step, and he wasn’t returning calls’, he said.

He revealed Mr Mr Brown agonised more about the location his first public statement after the election defeat than its content.

While he wanted to speak from Number 10 as Prime Minister, there were suggestions the address should be made from Victoria Street as leader of the Labour party.

In the end, following the advice of Alistair Darling who said ‘you’re not fleeing to no man’s land’, he did it from outside Downing Street on a lectern as a ‘compromise.’

The former minister claims Mr Brown’s first 20 minute phone call with Nick Clegg, who he ‘barely knew’ outside formal exchanges in the Commons, was ‘civil and workmanlike’.

Although he said Mr Brown congratulated him Nick Clegg on his elections results ‘rather like an uncle congratulating a nephew on good exam results’ in the word of one Number 10 aide.

But without their knowledge, a senior Liberal Democrat, he believed to be Paddy Ashdown, leaked a story to the BBC that the talk had been ‘terrible.’

Talks then foundered over when Gordon Brown would be willing to stand down, as the Lib Dems insisted there needed to be a change of leadership by the end of the year.

During negotiations between the Lib Dems and Labour on the Saturday afternoon, when Danny Alexander asked if there were any issues to raise, shamed former minister Chris Huhne said: ‘Yes, Gordon Brown and your leadership. This is the biggest issue for us.’

Lib Dem minister David Law’s book ‘22 Days in May: The Birth of the Lib Dem-Conservative Coalition’ was the first account of the talks, published six months after the election.

He revealed the Lib Dems never wanted a deal with Mr Brown who infuriated Mr Clegg during his phone calls, and Danny Alexander called him ‘absolutely barmy.’

Calls to Gordon Brown’s office were not returned last night.
