Actress Olivia Wilde has put her own twist on a best-selling Anthropologie dress, in a bid to raise awareness of sex trafficking.

The 29-year-old, who this week confirmed she is pregnant with fiance Jason Sudeikis' baby, co-designed a lace dress with Yoana Baraschi, available for $298 in new shades of pink, teal and black.

100per cent of proceeds from the first 1,000 dresses will go towards New Light - a non-profit organization based in India that helps young girls and women at high risk of forced prostitution. The donation is being made by Ms Baraschi, and will be matched by Anthropologie.

Get the look: Actress Olivia Wilde has turned her hand to fashion designing in a bid to raise awareness about sex trafficking - she co-created this dress for Anthropologie

Ms Wilde proudly models the New Light dress, part of an 11-piece capsule collection, on the Anthropologie blog, with the style effectively concealing her tiny baby bump.

She adds that would look great with 'boots and an edgy jacket'.

The New York-born star co-designed the dress with Barbara Burchfield - with whom she runs the charity, Conscious Commerce with - and Anthropologie designer Yoana Baraschi.

Speaking at the launch, Ms Wilde said: 'We're so excited because . . . proceeds [will be] going to this wonderful [organization] that provides an alternative for young women who would otherwise be entering into the commercial sex trade.

For a good cause: A portion of proceeds from the $298 style will go towards New Light - a non-profit organization based in India that helps young girls and women at high risk of forced prostitution

'So we're so proud to be working with Yoana, Anthropologie and New Light.'

Ms
 Wilde has long been a supporter of ethical fashion choices, setting up 
her shopping website Conscious Commerce to highlight products that are 
created responsibly.

Last year she and Ms Burchfield created a $138 bag for Alternative Apparel, which benefitted a secondary school in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

The duo add on the Anthropologie blog: 'After doing some digging and finding out that Americans spend over a billion dollars a day in retail, we thought, Wow, a very small dent in that would make a huge impact on some organizations that we know.

'We need to bring these two together. We believe in products for a purpose, and believe that our greatest vote is our dollar to buy the products and services that we believe in.'

Next up, they say they imagine going into 'anything from accessories to beauty products to food.'
