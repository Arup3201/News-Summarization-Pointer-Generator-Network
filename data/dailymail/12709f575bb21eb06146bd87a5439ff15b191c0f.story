Moeen Ali is determined to carry on with the aggressive approach that has seen him become a key figure at the top of England’s order and has vowed to go ‘hard’ at Australia when cricket’s old enemies resume hostilities on Friday.

If anyone epitomises the brand of cricket England will need to produce if they are to catch up with the pioneers of the one-day world then it is Moeen, who is determined to take his fearless approach all the way to the World Cup.

Moeen has been the best of the six openers England have used in 50-over cricket in the year leading up to the premier one-day tournament and has made it clear that if he is to go down at this World Cup then it will be fighting.

The 27-year-old has a strike rate of 109 in the 12 50-over matches he has played so far for England 

‘It’s the only way I can play in one-day cricket,’ said Moeen, who made a 38-ball 50 in England’s opening tour match here in Canberra. ‘Sometimes I face 30 balls and I feel as though I’ve had 50 or 60 already.

‘It’s natural for me to be aggressive and is the sort of thing I’ve done for a few years now. I feel it’s the best way for me to play and if I’ve got any doubts in the middle I just tell myself to keep on going hard and not go into a little shell.’

That means he will not be put off by the odd ugly dismissal, such as the first ball duck with which he ended the one-day tour of Sri Lanka. ‘It’s not nice getting out first ball but I’d prefer to go having a slog than just blocking it,’ he said.

The promotion of Moeen, 27, as an opener has been one of the few recent successes for England as they continue playing catch-up in one-day cricket.

He has a strike-rate of 109 in the 12 50-over matches he has played so far and made a brilliant 119 off 87 balls in Colombo to prove that he just as important to England in white-ball cricket as in the Test game.

But he insists there is more to come, ideally starting in Wednesday’s match against a Prime Minister’s XI and then the tri-series against Australia and India here that precedes the World Cup.

‘I definitely feel I can get better,’ he said. ‘It’s been one year of international cricket for me now and I feel like I’ve got better already so hopefully I can improve more. I do feel like I’ve got a lot more to show. It’s early days and there will be some tougher tests, like Australia, and that will be a real challenge.’

England meet the team that humiliated them this time last year in Sydney in Friday and in Hobart next week before the much-anticipated World Cup opener between the sides in Melbourne on February 14.

Moeen, in action on Monday, hopes he and Bell will forge a strong opening partnership for England

‘Each match now is a chance to show we’ve taken a step forward as a team and that we have intent and will come harder at Australia than perhaps we have done previously,’ said Moeen. ‘We just need to focus on what we need to do.

‘The standard of the opposition in our first game wasn’t as good as it will be but we showed we can be ruthless. That can only be a good thing.’

The sacking of Alastair Cook provided England with a chance to show that they will throw off their shackles here but they have only gone so far and it now seems certain Ian Bell rather than Alex Hales will open with Moeen.

‘When I started at Warwickshire Belly was there and I enjoy batting with him,’ said Moeen. ‘He’s quite busy, he’s good at getting singles as well as boundary shots and is a classy player. Hopefully we will be a good combination.

‘I think out styles complement each other. We’ve both got to bat our way. If he gets a hundred ball hundred that for him is the way to go. He should just bat the way he does and not worry about being too aggressive and hopefully I can take a bit of pressure off him at the other end and make it easier for him.’

The pair’s task will be made easier, at least on Friday, by the absence of Mitchell Johnson, who misses the first match of the tri-series with a sore hamstring. But Moeen insisted he is ready for the man who destroyed England in the Ashes. ‘I’m not too fussed who bowls to be honest,’ he said.

‘I’ll face him at some stage probably. He’s a world-class bowler who’s got so much respect and I’ve never faced anyone like that so we will see what happens but I feel like I’m ready to face anybody.’

If he can succeed against Johnson on Valentine’s Day then Moeen really will have arrived as a formidable international performer.
