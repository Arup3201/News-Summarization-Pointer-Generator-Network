For some, jumping out of an airplane is an amazing adventure. But for others, it’s just another day at work.

Sergeant William Raynor, of the 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers, mounted a GoPro camera to his helmet during a training jump from an airplane.

The video, released by the United States Department of Defense, gives a first-person perspective of what it’s like to jump from a plane.

Running out of the plane among the other members of his in division, Sergeant Raynor  jumps out feet first.

Once he’s suspended mid-air, it appears as if time has stopped.

Sergeant Raynor remains still, until releasing the handle to open his parachute.

Once his parachute is opened though, it becomes obvious that he’s surrounded by the rest of his division - and the scene becomes almost majestic, as he's surrounded by the open parachutes of the rest of his division.

Sergeant Raynor serves with the Airborne and Special Operations Forces.

The paratroopers are based, and performed their dive, at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.
