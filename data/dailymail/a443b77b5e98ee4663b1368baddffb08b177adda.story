A pit bull and a Chihuahua from Georgia proved they were best friends recently when the larger dog carried its small, injured pal to safety - and now they're looking for a loving home together.

About a week ago, pit bull Jonie was found carrying her injured friend Chachi inside her mouth, around a Savannah, Georgia, neighborhood.

According to animal control officers, the Chihuahua had a badly infected eye and Jonie was every now and then putting her pal down to lick the wound.

Best friends: 'It's not every day we get to see such devotion between two special dogs like this,' Animal Control Officer Christina Sutherin, pictured with Jonie, right, and Chachi, left, said

Chachi 'appreciated the attention,' according to a Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department Facebook post.

The officers then took the cute canines to Savannah Chatham Metropolitan Animal Control Shelter, where the Chihuahua underwent eye surgery.

Vets couldn't save the damaged eye, however they managed to stitch it up pretty well.

He was then reunited with his 'soul mate,' though they're not living together currently to allow Chachi to recover properly.

Officers said they were extremely excited to see each other, 'licking, whining, caressing and finally cuddling.'

'It's not every day we get to see such devotion between two special dogs like this,' Animal Control Officer Christina Sutherin said. The pets were named by the shelter after the Happy Days couple who married in the final episode.

'They are both such sweet animals. But the relationship they share just sets them apart.'

Initially, police expected the dogs' owner to come forward.

However, they're now appealing for someone to adopt them since no one has yet claimed the pair, obviously keeping them together.

Sutherin told the Huffington Post that neither one of the dogs seems to care about another dog they are exposed to, only each other.

'They truly appear to be soul mates,' she said.
