More than ten years after their deaths, a notorious bank robber  is going to trial for the murder of two people whose bodies were found buried in his yard.

Hugo Selenski, 41, gained notoriety in 2003 when authorities found at least five bodies buried on his northeastern Pennsylvania property. Two of those bodies were identified as Michael Kerkowski, a drug-dealing pharmacist, and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett.

Selenski allegedly strangled Kerkowski, who had pleaded guilty to selling more than 300,000 doses of painkillers without prescriptions, and his girlfriend, Fassett,  in May 2002.

He was charged for their murders when authorities uncovered their bodies more than one year later. 

Trial: Hugo Selenski, 41, (photographed) is going to trial for the 2002 murder of a Pennsylvania couple more than 10 years after being charged with murder

Charged: Selenski was charged in 2003 for the murders of Michael Kerkowski (left), a drug-dealing pharmacist, and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett (right) and is now going on trial

Bodies: In 2003, police uncovered five bodies buried on Selenski's Pennsylvania property, two of those were identified as Michael Kerkowski, a drug-dealing pharmacist, and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett

'She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,' Lisa Sands, Fassett's sister, said, happy that her sister's alleged killer will finally stand trial.

Authorities say Selenski killed the couple then stole tens of thousands of dollars from Kerkowski.

Selenski originally hid the bodies behind a high school, but soon, he and an accomplice, Paul Weakley, moved the bodies and buried them on Selenski's property, Weakley told police.

The convict continued to attract attention when he subsequently escaped from prison using bed sheets, turned himself in three days later, and won acquittal on homicide charges for two of the other corpses found on his property, according to The Patriot News. 

For years, Selenski has managed to avoid trial for the death's of Kerkowski and Fassett. 

After Selenski was cleared in 2006 of the deaths of two of the other people found in his yard, it was Kerkowski's and Fassett's turn for justice -- at least it was supposed to be.

The case has been shelved repeatedly by a slew of appeals, the dismissal and desertion of attorneys, and jurisdiction being transferred to five different judges in the last two years, according to the Standard Speaker. 

All of these factors have contributed to Selenski's dodging trial -- until now.  

It seems that even he knew it was only a matter of time before he would be brought to justice.

'A long time coming. A real long time,' Selenski told reporters as sheriff's deputies escorted him through the courthouse Wednesday morning.

Bury: Selenski allegedly strangled the couple and his the bodies behind a high school before enlisting the help of an accomplice to bury the bodies on his property 

Sentence: Selenski is currently serving an up to 65-year sentence for a 2003 robbery

Lawyers will begin choosing a jury Thursday, but the process is expected to take several days.

In fact, jury selection was supposed to begin Monday, according to WNEP, but was held up over arguments about whether to allow prosecutors to use the preliminary hearing testimony of a deceased witness. 

The issue took most of the morning to resolve, causing court officials to send 150 potential jurors home for the day, telling them to return Thursday, according to the Times-Leader. 

Selenski is currently serving 32 1/2 to 65  years in state prison for a January 2003 robbery, Weakley, who participated in the robbery, is cooperating with prosecutions against Selenski under a plea agreement, according to the Patriot.
