A ground fish product known as 'Tuna 
scrape' has been blamed for
a salmonella outbreak that has caused 116 cases, US health 
authorities said.

The illness is being linked to a frozen product called Nakaochi Scrape which was sold to restaurants and supermarkets to make sushi, particularly spicy tuna rolls, according to NPR.

The new concern comes as the spotlight has increasingly turned on where supermarket and restaurant food ingredients come from.

Earlier this month a series of firms producing controversial ammonia-treated beef - or what critics dub ‘pink slime’ - dropped the product.

Pennsylvania-based company AFA Foods which processed more than 500 million pounds of ground beef products a year went into bankruptcy.

AFA Foods had distributed to retailers including Wal-Mart and Safeways – but both supermarkets that no longer sell beef containing ‘pink slime'.

It has also been revealed the caustic cleaning chemical is also used in cheese and related compounds are found in baked goods and chocolate.

It is treated with ammonia to 
deter E. coli bacteria and typically added to ground meat, like 
hamburger, as a low-cost filler.

product concern over 'Tuna scrape' has resulted in a Food and Drug 
Administration recall notice.

The FDA describe Tuna scrape as 'tuna backmeat, which is specifically scraped off from the bones, and looks like a ground product.'

The product had been imported from India and distributed by Moon Marine Corporation USA in California, according to Food Safety News.

The associated salmonella outbreak affected people in 20 different states and the District of Columbia so far, FSN reported.

Michael Doyle, director of the Center
for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, told NPR: 'There are a 
lot of things we haven't heard of that the industry is doing.

'My
rule of thumb is that raw food of animal origin should be cooked before
it's eaten.

'I don't think enough research has been done on these 
products.'
