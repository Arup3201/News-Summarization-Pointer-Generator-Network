The Ministry of Defence has agreed to pay compensation to the family of an Afghan boy who was stabbed by a British soldier two years ago.

Grenadier Guardsman Daniel Crook was jailed and dismissed from military service after he stabbed 10-year-old Gulam Nhabi in the lower abdomen with a bayonet the morning after a heavy drinking session.

Agreeing that the incident was ‘appalling’ the MoD has now accepted liability for the unexplained attack in Helmand province in 2010.

The MoD has agreed to pay compensation to the family of a boy who was stabbed by a British soldier in Helmand province, Afghanistan (the picture is unrelated to the story)

The MoD has yet to disclose the amount
to be paid but Gulam's father, Shah Zada, a 72-year-old farmhand and shopkeeper, has previously said he asked for 
$40,000, approximately £25,500, in compensation at the time of the 
incident but only received $800 (£510).

The case was brought by a Birmingham law firm after British media reported on Crook’s court martial.

Public Interest Lawyers’ Daniel Carey 
told the Guardian that it was ‘regrettable that medical assistance and 
adequate compensation were not provided earlier.’

On the evening before the incident 
Crook drank ‘a considerable amount’ of vodka which had been sent to him 
disguised as mineral water in a welfare parcel.

He got so drunk that he had to be treated by medics and had his rifle confiscated as a safety measure then next morning.

Disgraced: Daniel Crook was dismissed from the Grenadier Guards. Its headquarters are at Wellington Barracks in London

Armed with two grenades and a bayonet 
he accompanied his unit as they left a checkpoint in the Nad-e-Ali 
district of the Helmand Province to go on patrol.

He came across two young Afghans riding 
bikes - one of them was Ghulam who had been sent out by his father to 
collect a bottle of yoghurt.

According to prosecutors at the court martial, the child had pestered Crook for chocolate.

In response, the soldier 'took hold of the boy's shoulder and stabbed him in the region of his kidneys with his bayonet'.

Shah Zada, told the Guardian that Cook had ordered his son to stop 'but he was just a little child and he didn't 
understand.'

Afterwards, Crook caught up with the patrol and admitted he had stabbed the child.

When questioned by military police he could not explain why he stabbed the boy.

Shocking: The attack on the young Afghan boy took place in the Nad e Ali district of Afghanistan's Helmand Province

The court martial took place in June 2011, Crook was jailed for 18 months and dismissed from the army.

Documents released by The Guardian on their datablog in March this year unveiled how military commanders do their utmost to prosecute any attacks upon civilians in Afghanistan.

The Royal Military Police opened 126 
investigations of incidents in which British troops allegedly killed or injured Afghan civilians between January 2005 and March 
2012.

Only eight of these led to prosecutions some of which were held in private summary hearings.

A spokesman for the Ministry of 
Defence said yesterday: ‘The MoD has accepted liability for this 
appalling incident and appropriate compensation will be paid on receipt 
of medical reports.

‘Incidents of this kind are extremely rare but any allegations of ill treatment are investigated thoroughly.

‘Protecting the Afghan civilian 
population is one of the UK's top priorities. All British troops undergo
comprehensive training on the strict rules of engagement under which UK
forces operate.
