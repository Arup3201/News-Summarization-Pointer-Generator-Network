John Norrish outside Exeter Crown Court today where he stands accused of raping a 33-year-old married woman

A woman who alleges she was raped by a hunt master after a black-tie ball had consumed around 20 alcoholic drinks, a court heard yesterday.

The 33-year-old drank three or four glasses of wine in a pub before arriving for the ball where she drank another ‘four to five wines and ten to 11 vodka and cokes’.

On a scale of one to ten of drunkenness, she said she was ‘eight to nine’, adding: ‘I was quite drunk.’

But she repeatedly rejected suggestions at Exeter Crown Court that she had consented to sex and made the rape claims only when her husband appeared at the scene.

She denied that she stopped having sex only when she noticed one of her husband’s friends outside the vehicle who had seen the huntsman’s ‘white bottom’ through the window in the dark.

It is alleged that John Norrish, 67, who was only vaguely known to the woman, approached her after her husband had left the annual ball of the Tiverton Staghounds at Cobley Farm, West Worlington, Devon, which was attended by up to 400 people.

She said he offered her a lift home, which she accepted, but that once they were both in his 4x4 he groped and then raped her.

Norrish told police that he was impotent, and said on his arrest: ‘I could not get it up.’

He later admitted having sex with the woman, saying it had been consensual.

Norrish, who was master of the hunt at the time of the ball last July, denies rape. But yesterday his alleged victim told the jury: ‘He leaned across and tried to touch my neck and kiss my neck. I asked him what he was doing. I did not want to. He tried to kiss me. He was all over my face.

‘I was not thinking, I was so scared. I did not know what to do. I said I did not want to.’

The mother told the court that Norrish reclined the passenger seat, removed her underwear, and then sexually assaulted her before raping her for about 15 minutes.

She said: ‘I was just crying. It felt like I had no control. He kept saying that I was pretty and how gorgeous I was.

‘I was lying there, not making any noise. I was scared and did not know what to do.’

The court was told that Norrish stopped when the lights of another car illuminated the makeshift car park in a field, allowing the woman to escape, leaving her possessions behind.

His alleged victim said: ‘I managed to find the strength to push him off with both hands as he had sex with me. I bolted for the door and I ran back to the yard where the party was.’

Norrish, 67, has been married for more than 30 years

The jury heard that she then stumbled into another car, which was carrying her husband and two of their friends.

‘I was hysterical, shouting and telling them what had happened,’ the woman said.

She rejected claims by Norrish’s barrister that she had been a willing participant who had removed her own shoes and underwear, and invented the story to explain herself to her husband.

She sobbed in the witness box and said ‘No, no’ when she was asked whether she had jumped out of Norrish’s car only after realising that her husband had arrived.

Robert Linford, defending, said: ‘I suggest what took place in the front seat of the car was utterly with your consent.

‘It was the reappearance of your husband which led to you saying you had been raped. You had to account for your actions.

‘You had taken your shoes and underwear off. You helped him move the seat back.

‘You were able to get him off you when your husband arrived back in the car park.

‘A friend who was with your husband looked into the car and saw the defendant’s white bottom. You saw him and that is why it had to be rape.

‘Once you had told your husband you had been raped you had to stick to that account to keep your marriage.’
