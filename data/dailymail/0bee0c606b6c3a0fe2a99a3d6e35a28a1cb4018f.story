An iconic pre-war racing car designed by the father of Bentley Motors has sold for £1.5 million at an auction. 

It was a world record price for the famed British marque at auction. 

The Lagonda LG45R Rapide - known simply by its registration plate 'EPE 97' - has been described as 'the most famous Lagonda of all'.

This beautiful burnt-red two-seater vehicle that could reach 100mph was built in 1936 after Lagonda had appointed W.O. Bentley - the man who started Bentley Motor Cars in 1919 - as their chief designer.

In its racing life, the EPE 97 was a Fox & Nicholl team car, competing in the 1937 Le Mans 24 Hours, as well as the RAC Tourist Trophy Race and British Racing Drivers' Club 500 Miles.

The EPE 97 was developed after Lagonda was purchased by businessman Alan Good to help stop their financial decline.

Good appointed W.O. Bentley, who was pivotal in transforming the flailing company as the first Lagonda designer to use a V-12 engine.

The vehicle's mythology means it is one of few that have come to be known simply by its UK registration number.
