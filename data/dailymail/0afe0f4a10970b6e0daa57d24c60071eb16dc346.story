The family and friends of tragic country music star Mindy McCready gathered today for her funeral in her Florida hometown.

Around 400 people attended the 2 p.m. service which was opened to the public at the Crossroads Baptist Church in Fort Myers as McCready's music played in the background and her image was shown on a large screen behind the altar.

The 37-year-old mother-of-two committed suicide with a self-inflicted gun-shot wound on February 17th at her home in Arkansas, days after leaving a court-ordered substance abuse treatment program.

It was the same way her boyfriend David 
Wilson took his own life at their Heber Springs home in 
Arkansas just over a month before.

At the emotional funeral Mindy's mother, Melody Gayle Inge, said the singer will always be her little girl in a car-seat singing into a hairbrush.

'I cannot imagine how we go on from here,' Ms Inge said.

She also said she was happy that her daughter's pain would now be healed in heaven after having endured such struggles while living.

Mindy’s funeral was opened to the public by her mother.

'Mindy’s life was public and the family welcomes friends and fans to join them in a celebration of Mindy’s life,' she said in a statement to USA Today.

'Our Mindy was so tired. She felt helpless,' said Inge.

'I know she wanted to be healed. We talked about this," Inge said. "She was in her darkest moment and she was hurt by so many allegations. She was too emotional to understand.'

The singer, known for her hits 'Guys Do It All the Time' and 'Ten Thousand Angels', also had tributes paid to her by her brother and stepfather.

Her brother, Sky, recalled how they raised each other growing up and used to play the video game Pac Man all night when she visited after she became famous.

The service came nine days after the troubled singer shot herself in at her lakefront home in Heber Springs, Arkansas.

As mourners filed into Crossroads Baptist Church, McCready's casket was delivered in a white hearse escorted by two police cars.

As songs from the singers often checkered career played, two large video screens played out a montage of photographs charting the course of her life.

One of the pictures included in the series was a glossy picture of her and onetime fiancé Dean Cain.

As she fought back tears during the funeral service, her Ms Inge told those gathered, 'Mindy adored her two children. She wanted them to know that.

'Through much agony and pain, she went to heaven. She is no longer sick. She is healed. Thank you for all who are here. Please pray for those boys. No matter what, she will always be my little girl, sitting in her car seat, singing into a hairbrush. The world was her stage.'

Prior to the funeral, family members had said that Crossroads Baptist was selected because Mindy used to go to the church every once in a while.

And before the service, Gayle Inge released a statement saying, 'Our family is devastated by the loss of our beautiful and talented daughter, Mindy McCready. Her life, no matter how brief, touched many, and she will forever be our special angel.'

The service ended with Mindy’s stepfather and mother thanking the church, family, friends and media for coming to the funeral. Mindy’s two children Zander, 6, and Zayne, 9 months, are not believed to have attended.

McCready is survived by two sons, one by McKnight and the other by David
Wilson, her boyfriend who took his own life 36 days before Mindy did.

McCready will be buried in Ft. Myers. A second memorial service for her 
professional colleagues to attend is to take place in Nashville in early
March.

Just last week it was claimed that the 37-year-old's first suicide attempt was in July 2005 when she overdosed on pills and alcohol. It came two months after her former fiance and father of her eldest son Zander assaulted her and left her in the hospital.

She was also facing legal troubles for a DUI and using a fake prescription to buy OxyContin.

LA Times music writer Mikael Wood told E! News: 'After
the altercation with McKnight she tried to cut ties with him. But there
was a second attempt after she got back with him. She was found 
unconscious in a hotel lobby in Florida and hospitalized.'

This
was McCready second overdose, in September 2005, this time on 
antidepressants, while pregnant with her and McKnight's son Zander.

Wood
said: '[Zander] turned out to be OK, but there was a third attempt in 
2008,' referring to the time she slit her wrists at her home in 
Nashville.

The 
fourth attempt was in 2010. Wood said authorities took her to the 
hospital for an overdose though it was not clear if it was intentional 
or not.

'The fifth suicide attempt was the one that took her life,' Wood told E! News.

McCready shot the dog before taking her own life. He sons were in foster care at the time.

Billy McKnight said: 'As sad as it is, it didn¿t come as a major shock, because she¿s just been battling demons for so long. I was around her when she attempted suicide twice, so I knew it was in her'

Former fiance Billy McKnight and 
father of her eldest son Zander said he strongly believes that she would
have killed her two young children if they had been along with her.

He told the National Enquirer: 'Just 
look at what she did and how she did it. She killed the dog before she 
killed herself  and I fear she would have taken those kids with her too 
if they had been there.'

The lead singer of country rock group
Soul Circus Cowboys said earlier this week McCready's suicide came as 
no shock to him as he was with her when she tried it twice before. 

Leading lady: Mindy McCready became an instant 
star in 1996 at age 20 with the release of her debut album 'Ten Thousand
Angels.' She dated 'Lois and Clark' actor Dean Cain and was frequently 
seen on the red carpet
