A Japanese airline said it plans to recover the losses it has suffered after its fleet of high-tech Boeing Dreamliner aircraft was grounded by concerns over a faulty lithium-ion battery.

All Nippon Airways (ANA) is the biggest customer for the Dreamliner, with 17 of the jets in 
its fleet, and was forced to cancel 459 domestic and international flights at a cost of around Â£9.1million ($15.4million).

Now a senior executive at the airline, Asia's largest by revenue, has announced it is prepared to claim from Boeing 
whatever damages it suffers from flight cancellations and other costs 
caused by the worldwide grounding of 787 jets.

Chief Financial Officer Kiyoshi Tonomoto said the airline was focused on investigating the cause of the 787 battery problems, and it was not yet in damage negotiations with Boeing.

He also said efforts were focused on minimising flight disruptions and revenue losses by using other aircraft.

'But we will negotiate with Boeing,' Tonomoto added. 'We are now focusing on assuring safety for our customers.'

Boeing is under increasing pressure 
after it emerged the plane manufacturer knew of previous problems with 
the batteries yesterday.

ANA said it 
had to replace the batteries on its 787 aircraft ten times because they failed 
to charge properly or showed other problems.

January 7 - A battery caught fire on a Japanese Airlines 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport. Investigators called it a 'very serious air safety concern'.

January 8 - A fuel leak forced a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight to be cancelled at the same airport.

January 9 - An ANA flight from Tokyo's Haneda is cancelled after a problem with the brakes.

January 11 - US federal regulators order a comprehensive review of the fleet.

January 13 - Narita International Airport says JAL reported a 100-litre fuel leak in a 787.

when its main battery overheated. Federal Aviation Administration grounds
all U.S. Boeing 787s

January 17 - Flight ban extends to entire fleet across Europe, U.S. and Asia.

January
18 - An investigator in Japan said the battery received voltage in excess of its limits.

January 30 - Boeing was ordered to provide a full operating history of the batteries used in its Dreamliners after it emerged the firm was aware of problems

January
31 - The founder of Tesla Motors has said the batteries used by Boeing 
in its Dreamliner aircraft are 'inherently unsafe'

According to the New York Times, ANA 
said in five of the ten replacement batteries the main battery had 
showed a low charge. In three cases, the airline said the main battery 
failed to operate normally.

Japan
Airlines spokesman Sze Hunn Yap declined to be more specific on when 
units were replaced or whether these were reported to authorities.

Adding to the pressure on Boeing, U.S. innovator and entrepreneur
Elon Musk, who is the founder of Tesla car company, told British 
aerospace journal Flight International that the batteries were always faulty.

He said: 'Unfortunately, the pack architecture supplied to 
Boeing is inherently unsafe.'

All 50 of the Boeing 787s in use around the world were grounded following two incidents with the batteries earlier this month.

First, there was also a battery fire in a 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport on January 7.

Then on January 16, an ANA flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Japan when its main battery overheated.

There were also reported incidents of faults with fuel leaks and problems with the braking system.

Following the revelations about the previous problems with the batteries, Boeing was ordered to provide a full operating history of the batteries used in its 787 Dreamliners.

The National Transportation Safety Board in the U.S. made the request after becoming aware of the previous incidents.

Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said Wednesday the U.S. manufacturer is sticking with plans to speed up 787 production and sees no reason to drop the lithium-ion batteries.

Airlines have been replacing 787 batteries at a rate that's 'slightly higher' than Boeing had expected, but they were being replaced for maintenance reasons, not for safety concerns, he said.

McNerney said 'good progress' is being made in finding the cause of the problems, but didn't have a timeline for when the plane would get back in the air.

Tonomoto said ANA revenue will be eroded by about three per cent for this fiscal year ending March 31 if the 787 services can't be resumed, but that will translate to minimal impact on profit. Such losses will be gradually reduced over coming months, he said.

'It is not small,' Tonomoto said of the 787 impact. 'But it is not that great.'

The Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries. They charge faster and can be better moulded to space-saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries.

Lithium-ion batteries are prone to overheating and require additional safeguards to prevent fires.
