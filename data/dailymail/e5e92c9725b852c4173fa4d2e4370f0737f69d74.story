A homeless college football player is no longer on Baylor's team after a family friend gave the young man a place to stay.

Silas Nacita, a running back and junior at the Texas school, said on Twitter that he was 'no longer eligible to play football and pursue my dream'.

He wrote that the friend from his home in Bakersfield, California, got him an apartment in Texas because he 'didn't want me sleeping on floors and wondering how I was going to eat the next meal'.

Silas Nacita, from Bakersfield, California, said he was no longer eligible to play football at Baylor University because he accepted housing from a family friend

He said the friend, 'insisted' on helping him out with living expenses.

The NCAA said that it 'did not declare Silas Nacita ineligible and Baylor has not requested a waiver for him'.

Baylor had no option but to kick him off the team after he chose not to pursue university and NCAA-offered ways of finding housing and lived with the family friend, according to Baylor fan website BearsTruth.

Baylor confirmed that Mr Nacita 'will not be a part of the football program moving forward due to rules violations that impact his eligibility'.

After a day of observers' fury and frustration over why the young man would not be able to play football, he followed up on his Twitter post by saying that he takes 'full responsibility' for his actions and 'inappropriate benefits'.

Speaking of accepting housing, Mr Nacita said: 'The bottom line is that I broke the rules. I should've never accepted the help and I am deeply sorry for my actions.'

He said 'now I see I made a mistake disregarding guidance from Baylor compliance on what benefits I can receive.'

The young man was homeless for the end of high school and slept on friend's couches while saving money and attending community college,

Under NCAA rules it is illegal for students to accept money or gifts related to their athletic performances.

The university's football coach Art Briles said: 'If he's eligible, he'll be back. This is out of our control, it isn't our problem with him' according to Sports Illustrated.

Mr Nacita, from Bakersfield, California, became homeless his senior year of high school after clashing with his mother following the death of his father when he was 16.

He played football as a freshman for the Ivy League's Cornell in 2012. 

He later transferred to Baylor, but was unable to enroll immediately because he could not get a loan.

The young man  spent his time before enrolling taking community college classes online and sleeping on friends' floors while waiting tables at restaurant chain Cheddar's.

The running back eventually received a financial aid package and scholarship from Baylor, though did not pursue the recommended avenues of finding housing

His mother and he  reconciled after he hitchhiked from Texas to California following a tough shift at work.

Without an athletic scholarship, he eventually received a financial aid package and scholarship, but did not receive money for books and would snap pictures of pages of his texts in the store to avoid having to purchase them. 

The running back did not participate in a spring practice on Tuesday, according to ESPN.

He earned All-Academic Big 12 honors last year in addition to rushing for 191 yards.

Earlier this week Mr Nacita had posted photos saying how excited he was to wear Baylor's new uniforms in the fall.

He said Thursday: 'I would like to get back to my studies so that I'm not paying off these student loans when I'm 50.'
