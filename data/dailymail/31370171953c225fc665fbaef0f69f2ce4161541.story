The partner of a woman who was stabbed to death alongside her two-year-old son yesterday condemned a serious case review which concluded that the tragedy could not have ‘reasonably predicted’.

Rachael Slack was pregnant with Robert Barlow’s child when she was knifed to death with 23-month-old son Auden in full view of a neighbour at her home.

In October, an inquest jury ruled the deaths were ‘more than minimally contributed to by a [police] failure to impress upon’ Miss Slack the conclusion of a police risk assessment which placed the victims at high risk of death or serious injury at the hands of Auden’s unstable father, Andrew Cairns.

Tragedy: Rachael Slack and her son Auden were murdered by his father who made repeated threats to kill her - but experts said today her death could not have been predicted

Anger: Pictured on ITV's Daybreak, Robert Barlow said the report had not gone far enough

But the serious case review by Derby Safeguarding Children Board (DSCB) 
makes no mention of the inquest jury’s findings and concludes that the 
tragedy could not have been foreseen with information known at the time.

Cairns, 44, a former golf tutor, killed the pair at Miss Slack’s cottage
 in Holbrook, Derbyshire, in June 2010, after she had told him she was 
having a baby with Mr Barlow - the childhood sweetheart she had resumed 
contact with via Facebook.

Killer: Andrew Cairns told  Rachael he would attack her, and was even arrested, only to be released and hack her to death

After the killings Cairns, originally from Lancashire, took his own life and was found slumped over the other bodies.

Cairns had been arrested for threatening to kill ex-lover Miss Slack, 38, less than a week before the bloodbath.

But while police called the human resources manager the next day to advise her that a decision had been taken to bail Cairns while inquiries continued - officers failed to impress upon her the conclusions of a risk assessment they had conducted on Cairns while he was being held.

Derbyshire Police then compounded their blunder that evening when Cairns’ neighbour reported that he was considering abducting Auden.

An officer was despatched to carry out a ‘safe and well’ check on Cairns, but despite initially discovering the golf tutor’s home empty, merely telephoned Miss Slack to check she was OK.

Yesterday Mr Barlow, 42, a joinery company boss, was backed by Miss Slack’s family and a domestic abuse charity in criticising the SCR’s findings.

‘I don’t agree with it at all’, he said.

‘There was so much information that was scattered over so many professional agencies, (yet) they couldn’t put it all together to make a professional judgement call, that could have made a difference to Rachael and Auden’s life.

New partner: Robert Barlow says Rachael and Auden were failed and 'could have been alive today' but police ignored the threats to kill

In danger: Cairn was bailed with conditions not to contact Miss Slack or Auden and an assessment placed Rachael at a 'high risk of homicide'

‘Derbyshire Police should be damned for not telling her she was at risk of homicide. These things can’t just fall to the wayside.

‘The (agencies) just didn’t share the information with us or one another. The left hand didn’t know what the right was doing.’

Miss Slack’s family said they would write to the chair of the Safeguarding Children’s Board to express their concerns.

Her mother and brother, Jean and Haydon Slack, said in a statement: ‘We cannot understand why the Serious Case Review omitted from its description of the inquest jury’s verdict the finding that failings by the police contributed to the unlawful killing of Auden.

‘It makes us wonder whether the authorities who were party to this report, including Derbyshire police, are serious about improving the service they give to women and children facing domestic violence.’

Cairns had been receiving treatment for depression with Derbyshire Mental Health Services Trust for over two years before the tragedy and had come into contact with police on a number of occasions.

He was detained by police under the Mental Health Act on May 26, 2010 - a week before the killings - after Miss Slack could not get him to leave her car. He was assessed by mental health workers and released after he was found to have no major mental illness.

New life: Cairns began threatening Rachael when she told him she was expecting another child with her new partner Robert Barlow

Signs: Cairns had been known to the authorities since 1999 after he attempted suicide

The following day Cairns was arrested 
after warning Miss Slack: ‘You’ve no idea what I’m capable of. I’ll kill
 you and take him with me.’ The 76 page SCR, published yesterday, said 
Derbyshire Constabulary received about 150 to 160 reports of threats to 
kill each year. This was the only one where the threat was ‘followed by 
enactment’ in the last three years.

The
 report criticised the way agencies shared information about Cairns and 
said they focussed on his needs rather than the those of the mother and 
child, and failed to consider adequately the danger he could have posed 
to them.

So far no one involved has lost their job or been disciplined over the deaths.

The
 independent chair of the Derbyshire Safeguarding Children Board, 
Christine Cassell, said the report highlighted the importance of ‘making
 sure agencies understand that they must think about the entire family’,
 regardless of ‘the person they’re working with primarily’.

Sandra
 Horley, chief executive of the Refuge national domestic violence 
charity, said she was concerned that the report had described incidents 
of murder or suicide involving a family with a child as ‘incredibly 
rare’, when ‘two women each week are killed in England and Wales by 
current or former partners.’
