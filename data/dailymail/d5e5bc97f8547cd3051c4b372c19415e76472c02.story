The parents of a war hero killed by a speeding drink-driver said they were 'devastated' at the jail term handed to their son's killer.

Gary Pedelty, 24, who had toured Iraq with the 3rd Battalion Yorkshire Regiment, was killed when drunken Richard Mail's car smashed into his in November 2010.

But despite driving after five pints and speeding at 75mph on a 60mph road in Huddersfield, Mail was jailed for just four years, meaning he will be free in two.

Mail, 38, will only serve half his sentence despite a court hearing how his father and a barmaid had confiscated his keys, only for him to take them back later and get behind the wheel.

War hero Pedelty's parents, Kevin and Aletia, branded the jail term 'ridiculous' as their son's death has caused them 'unimaginable pain'.

They said after the hearing at Bradford Crown Court: 'Gary was a war hero, he served for his country.

'This sentence is ridiculous. It only tells people they can go out and get drunk and they will be free in two years. What sort of a deterrent is that? It’s not long enough.'

The court heard on Friday that Mail had drunk at least five pints of Stella Artois at a pub, where his father had put his car keys behind the bar.

He managed to get his keys back after the barmaid who had served him finished her shift, and left the pub at about 5pm on November 22 2010.

He later careered across a carriageway in Huddersfield, West Yorks and smashed into Pedelty's Mazda 323, pushing the soldier's car into a drystone wall which crushed him inside his vehicle.

The court heard that father-of-two Mail, who was speeding at 75mph on the 60mph road in Huddersfield, West Yorks, did not plead guilty to the offence of causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed limit until days before his trial was due to start, which Jayne Beckett, prosecuting, said added to the 'suffering of Gary’s family'.

Gary, from Meltham, West Yorks., was pronounced dead at the scene and Mail was taken to hospital with a a broken leg and eye socket where doctors found that his blood alcohol level to be one-and-a-half times over the legal limit.

A police officer overheard him telling a family member: 'I was on the right side of the road. He must have been p***ed the little t**t.'

Judge Colin Burn also handed Mail, who was also taking a prescription of 15ml of methadone each day, a three-year driving ban.

He told him: 'I find there are two aggravating factors here.

'Firstly, that you drove in the face of warnings not to and secondly, that you were speeding.

'I think it’s clear to say that Mr Pedelty was a remarkable man who was an extremely fine individual. His death has caused untold hurt and bewilderment. You caused his death by having far too much to drink.

'In your case it clearly wasn’t helped by a daily dose of prescribed methadone. Then on top of that you got behind the wheel of your car.

'You ignored both your father and bar staff who tried to keep your keys after in their view you had consumed too much to drink. In your account that was five pints of Stella Artois, which is not in itself a weak beer.

'No sentence I can pass will make any difference to the suffering of this family.'

Gary's family later added in a statement: 'Though we are relieved that the defendant driver has been banned from driving and sent to prison for four years, we are devastated at the sentence and feel that it is not harsh enough.

'Although the criminal process has now come to an end, the family remain extremely traumatised by their loss.'

Gary’s mother added: 'Gary’s death has caused unimaginable pain for me, my husband, our sons Jordan and Jason and Gary’s friends. He had everything to live for an we just can’t believe that he is gone.'
