Michael Laudrup's agent has hit back at comments from Swansea defender Alan Tate, who claimed the sacked Dane stripped him of the captaincy without telling him first.

Tate captained Swansea at the start of the 2011-12 season, but was aggrieved a year later when Laudrup, in his first season at the club, opted to give the armband to Ashley Williams.

Tate, who admitted he did not have a good relationship with Laudrup, said last week: ‘It was before the Everton game (in September 2012). I didn’t know that I wasn’t going to be captain. He took the captaincy off me but didn’t tell me, and things went from there really.

‘I’ve been a Swansea player for 12 years, but sometimes a new manager comes in and you don’t get on with him.’

Laudrup’s representative, Bayram Tutumlu, has responded by saying: ‘Tate should keep his mouth shut.

‘He was not often in the team so he complains. I do not like this. I had a gentleman’s agreement with (Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins) for us not to talk. Why is Alan Tate talking like this? These comments are disappointing.’ 

Laudrup lost his job at the Liberty Stadium in February after leading the club to the Capital One Cup in his first season in charge. Tate has played 293 for Swansea since initially joining the club on loan.

The 31-year-old, who started his career at Manchester United, has had spells on loan at Leeds, Yeovil and Aberdeen in the past two seasons.
