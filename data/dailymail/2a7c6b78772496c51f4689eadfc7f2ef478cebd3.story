Algeria added their name to the list of beguiling stories at this World Cup by defeating South Korea in a meandering match and moving to the brink of the knock-out rounds for the first time in their history.

Islam Slimani, Rafik Halliche, and Abdelmoumene Djabou each struck in 12 first-half minutes to sweep away their stereotype as a team set out to stifle.

Son Heung-Min claimed a goal back early in the second half to wobble the Africans but Yacine Brahimi replied and Vahid Halilhodzi’s side held on to go second behind Belgium in Group H.

Man of the Match: Brahimi

The 61-year-old Bosnian has done much to alter the dour style of Algeria’s play since the 2010 World Cup, which saw them fail to score including an awful 0-0 draw with England.

Algeria had mustered just two goals in 11 hours and 25 minutes of World Cup football before kick-off but in qualifying for Brazil were only outscored in their continent by Ghana, Ivory Coast and Egypt.

They blitzed their opponents in chilly Porte Alegre with attacks of pace and fluidity. They also disturbed Korea with long balls and occasional physicality. The Asians’ defending was pretty abysmal too.

Slimani got the first in the 26th minute, powering in between centre-backs Hong Jeong-ho and Kim Young-gwon to collect a long ball forward by Carkl Medjani and apply a finish beyond Jung Sung-ryong.

Just one minute and 55 seconds later it was 2-0. Djabou swung over a corner that Jung thought he could claim but former Fulham defender Halliche arrived first to drive a header into the unguarded net. The Korean goalkeeper was poor in the game against Russia and could be replaced when Belgium come calling.

More comical defending arrived soon after when Hong and Kim got in each others’ way as they attempted to clear a long ball, only succeeding in allowing it to fall to Slimani, who squared to Djabou to sweep in.

Korea manager Hong Myung-bo, veteran of the 2002 team which made the semi-finals, must have said something to rouse his players at the break because they were much improved in the second half.

Madjid Bougherra’s inability to deal with a high ball allowed Son to whip a finish in between the legs of Rais M’Bolhi five minutes after the interval and Korea looked like they might make a comeback when a quick free-kick by Park Chu-young had to be headed off the line by Aissa Mandi.

M’Bohli then produced a marvellous one-handed save to deny Swansea’s Kim Sung-yueng a ferocious, swerving goal from 30 yards that was heading for the top corner.

But Brahami dispelled Algerian fears three minutes after the hour by finishing off a neat move that involved a slick exchange of passes with Djabou.  

Koo Ja-Cheoi tapped in from Lee Keun-ho’s cross with 18 minutes left to reduce the deficit to two once more but it was in vain.

Algeria will progress to the last-16 for the first time in their history with a draw in their final game against Russia and would play the runners-up from the group containing Germany, USA, Ghana and Portugal.

To put that achievement in context, this is Algeria’s fourth appearance at World Cup finals and they have just two previous wins to their name.

Those both came in 1982 when they were denied progress to the knock-out phase by an outrageous bit of gamesmanship from West Germany and Austia in playing out a result that ensured they both progressed at the expense of the north Africans.

Algeria exacting revenge on Germany 32 years later would usually be the stuff of fantasy. But, as we have seen, anything is possible in Brazil.
