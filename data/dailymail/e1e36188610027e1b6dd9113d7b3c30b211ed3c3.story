A boyfriend finally proposed to the love of his life - as he lay injured in the road after a horrific holiday quad-bike crash.

Joanne McGlynn, 29, and Leyton Williams, 42, decided to end a two-week getaway on the Greek paradise isle of Zakynthos with a 4x4 dirt-bike tour.

Hours into the romantic ride, Leyton accidentally careered into a cliff face, throwing him from the saddle, leaving him unconscious with 20 broken bones throughout his body.

But as Joanne begged him to wake up, Leyton suddenly came to and spluttered: 'Marry me ... I love you.'

Meant to be: Joanne McGlynn, 29, had waited nine years for her lover Leyton Williams, 42, to propose

'As I was lying there in the road I suddenly saw things in perspective,' said Leyton from the couple's new home in Cardiff. 'I thought I was taking my last few breaths and when I saw Joanne in front of me I knew that I wanted to marry her.

'Luckily for me I survived and she said Yes!'

Joanne admitted it was a 'make-or-break' holiday as she feared their their nine-year relationship was on the rocks.

Joanne witnessed the crash and was kneeling next to Leyton as he waited for an ambulance crew to take him to hospital.

She said: 'I saw him crash and thought he would never survive it.

'I ran over and he was lying in a heap - he looked dead and I was screaming for him to wake up.

'Suddenly he opened his eyes and asked me to marry him - I couldn’t believe it.'

Leyton spent a week in hospital on the island before being allowed out to fly back home to Cardiff, South Wales.

The pair were living apart - but they have now moved in together at Joanne’s home in Ely, Cardiff, so she can care for him.

Joanne said: 'It was a make-or-break holiday - we’ve had a difficult last few years together.

'But Leyton’s accident makes you realise what’s important in life - and deep down we always knew we were right for each other.'

Leyton was recovering yesterday from a broken collar bone, a cracked shoulder, four broken ribs, a broken nose and a string of other fractures.

The pair, who have an eight-year-old daughter Elle-Marie, are now planning a wedding next year.
