Playing Rafael Nadal on clay is the cruellest form of sport, and as if Andy Murray did not know that already he got a painful reminder of it again on Friday night.

More than two and a half years since last facing the Spaniard the Wimbledon champion produced his best tennis of the year, his best since that heady fortnight of last summer, and still it was not enough.

Murray threw almost everything he had at the world number one but as the bell tolled midnight was edged out of their Italian Open quarter final 1-6, 6-3, 7-5, having created enough chances to score one of the finest wins of his career.

Delight: Rafael Nadal celebrates after beating Andy Murray in the quarter-finals of the Italian Open in Rome

Long battle: The Spaniard had to work hard to get past Murray who won the first set comfortably

Respect: The pair shake hands after a titanic battle

If this had been on grass, with the 
margins of self-belief tilted slightly in the opposite directions, then 
he would surely have closed this one out after working so hard to go 4-2
 ahead in a thrilling decider.

But
 this was the brown dust that Nadal was borne into, and his marginally 
sterner resolve and skill in the environment saw him pull through in 
time-honoured fashion.

That 
the Spaniard celebrated afterwards as if he had just retained the French
 Open title was testament to the trial he was put through, and there 
were ample consolations for the 27 year-old Scot in defeat.

Having
 wobbled over the loss of Ivan Lendl, and at times looked bereft in 
scrambling around for the form he enjoyed before last September’s back 
surgery, this was a statement that his talents have survived it all.

Running out of energy: After being broken back in the third set Murray struggled to recover

Fast start: Murray flew out of the blocks against Nadal and took the first set 6-1 to shock the Spaniard

Number one: But Nadal really had to dig in against the Brit on his return to form

It
 was little surprise that there was some bitter-sweet feeling 
afterwards, with Murray reflecting, “I thought I did pretty well, and I 
was expecting to start playing better around this time. I don’t think 
some people have quite respected what it’s like to have back surgery and
 come back from that.

'But 
I’m disappointed with how I played at 4-2, it was a poor game. I rushed a
 bit and against someone like Rafa you don’t get many chances.'

A
 couple of unforced errors betrayed him at that point, but overall 
Lendl’s legacy was there in his pounding of Nadal’s backhand side and 
sustained aggression. At the end Nadal finished the stronger and broke 
to love at 5-5, helped by a double fault. He believed more.

The
 opening was not just Murray’s best set of tennis since Wimbledon but up
 with the best of his career as he gave the great Spaniard a rare 
chasing to take it in just 37 minutes.

Finally: Nadal celebrates with a fist pump after securing victory

Struggling: The pair hadn't played each other for almost three years, and it was obvious Nadal wasn't comfortable

Passion: Murray roars in celebration after a long point during that first set in Rome

Concentration: The Spaniard regrouped and never looked back

A
 cool evening with slight drizzle probably helped as it took a fraction 
of the sting from Nadal’s heavily spun strokes. But it is hard to recall
 the Murray backhand being delivered with more laserlike accuracy, and 
he used it to open the court up, choosing wisely when to fire it down 
the line to test his opponent’s stronger forehand side.

At
 5-0 the capacity crowd packed into the steep banks of the Foro 
Italico’s Court Centrale could scarcely believe the domination being 
exercised over the seven-times champion at this historic venue.

Twice
 previously this week Nadal has been forced into a third set, and while 
that might have sapped even his legs he recovered right on cue. Murray 
had a big chance when he created a break point in the second set’s 
opening game but that was saved with a massive, outswinging ace to the 
backhand side. The Spaniard also attacked the net to great effect from 
the second set onwards – he remains the sport’s great problem solver.

Nadal now plays rising star Grigor Dimitrov while in the other semi-final Novak Djokovic takes on Canadian Milos Raonic.
