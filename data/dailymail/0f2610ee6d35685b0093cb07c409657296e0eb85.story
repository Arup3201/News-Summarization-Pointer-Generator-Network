Mancherster City may be without Frank Lampard for Thursday's game at home to Sunderland after the Premier League champions got caught up in red tape trying to extend his loan spell at the club.

City have been talking to the Premier League about extending Lampard’s loan from sister club New York City FC to the early weeks of 2015. 

Frank Lampard trains with his team-mates but may not join them in the side on New Year's Day

Lampard has been a hit for Manchester City since joining on loan from New York City FC

The club hoped to have the arrangement ratified and officially announced by now but have hit a snag because Lampard’s loan spell in England expires on Wednesday night and the new transfer window doesn’t open until the early hours of Saturday morning.

That means City may have to wait until Saturday to re-register the ex-England star. 

Negotiations were ongoing on Tuesday night, with City hopeful of a positive outcome.
