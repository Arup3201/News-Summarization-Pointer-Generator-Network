A babysitter accused of killing a toddler in her care has been sentenced to three years' probation after accepting a plea deal.

Megan Martzen, 22, pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter, after her trial for the murder of 17-month-old Ella VanLeeuwen ended in a hung jury in February.

Ella was injured while she and her older brother were in Martzen's care at their home in Reedley, California, in 2009. The little girl died three days later.

The VanLeeuwen family blamed the babysitter, while Martzen told police that Ella sustained the injuries after falling from her bed.

Martzen accepted a felony conviction in exchange for a sentence of probation, after the murder trial ended in a mistrial.

The 22-year-old is officially not a murderer, but by pleading no contest to the charge of involuntary manslaughter, she admitted playing a role in the toddler's death, according to abcnews.com.

Speaking outside Fresno County Court ahead of the sentencing, Martzen said: 'I would've never done anything to hurt Ella, I loved her so much.

'My heart hurts for the family.'

Judge Edward Sarkisian said at the hearing: 'Everyone in this courtroom loves Ella VanLeeuwen, and if Ella was physically here, she'd say she also loves everyone in this courtroom.'

Ella's parents Todd and Deniele VanLeeuwen were at the emotional hearing.

The family's pastor Dennis Fast told the judge: 'Todd and Deniele told me they have forgiven Megan for whatever happened that day.'

Martzen's family told Action News they hope that the once close families will reconcile in the future.

'We know that healing will occur,' her father-in-law John Martzen said.

At present Martzen is only allowed to spend 48 hours per week with her son Maverick, according to abcnews.com.

Maverick lives with his father, while Martzen lives with her mother.

Martzen was also ordered to carry out 250 hours of community service, according to a report in the Fresno Bee.
