Prince William was left helpless with laughter today after his bemused father was described as 'quite buff' during an event in Covent Garden today.

The second in line to the throne had donned a wet suit to demonstrate his snorkelling skills in a Central London swimming pool when the delicate subject of a topless picture of Prince Charles taken in the 70s was raised.

Chairman of the British Sub-Aqua Club, Eugene Farrell, had guests in stitches as he described the photograph of the heir to the throne as being 'quite buff' during his own diving days.

But while the rest of the room fell about laughing, Charles was left baffled, looking to his son for an explanation.

Ever helpful, William, 32, leaned over and explained it to his father who raised his eyebrows theatrically, only to be told: 'Pa, you should be pleased! ' by a laughing Duke of Cambridge.

Charles did see the funny side, quipping 'I know my eldest will now demonstrate his buff credentials' during his own address.

Father and son were at the Oasis Leisure Centre near Covent Garden where Charles was formally handing over his presidency of the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) after 40 years to William.

His own father, The Duke of Edinburgh, previously held the presidency and joked that he had installed a love of the water in his son from an early age.

'I threw him in the swimming pool on occasions. Instead of putting him off, it enthused him,' he said.

Charles also recalled how he had been 'absolutely terrified' when he divided in the Arctic and and how once, when a Moray Eel, came out of the gloom and put its teeth on his mask he 'shot off like a Polaris missile'.

'I hope one day my son, George, might follow in our footsteps,' said William during his own speech. 'At the moment bath time is quite painful but hopefully donning a snorkel and mask might calm him down.'

William then donned a wet suit and got into the outdoor pool - despite earlier admitting he was something of a 'fair weather diver' - and tried his hand at snorkelling with a group of eight-year-olds.

The prince slipped easily into the water as he chatted with the youngsters about their own diving experiences.

He was then challenged to a race - but let the others win. Then it was time to put on his own, borrowed, mask and tank and get under the water.

Brrr! As his father promised, Prince William demonstrated his buff credentials in the chilly swimming pool

Fellow diver Tom Billingham , 17, who dives with the Dudley Dolphins, said: 'He was a natural diver and had clearly done it many times before. He appeared to be really enjoying himself.'

Charles watched the end of the display and jokingly threw a plastic crab into the water at his son  before leaving William to get changed.

Tony Marshall, Vice chairman of the BSAC, said William was following in a long line of royal divers.

'Prince William trained with us and as well as with the army down at Fort Bovisand near Plymouth,' he said. 'I also know he has been out with one of our local groups on Anglesey.

'The Duchess, his wife, is also a member of the BSAC. He admitted that he prefers warm water diving but clearly has a passion for the sport. It is one of the most exciting sports you can be involved in.'

Eugene Farrell, Chairman of the BSAC which has 30,000 members countrywide, said it was an honour to welcome William as the third generation of his family to become president.

'We look forward to working closely with The Duke to inspire a new generation of young scuba divers and snorkellers to discover the rich adventure and opportunities of the underwater world which we all have a shared interest in preserving and protecting,' he said.
