Lord McAlpine’s lawyers were last night negotiating with ITV for damages over the broadcast in which This Morning host Phillip Schofield presented the Prime Minister with a list of alleged paedophiles.

The Conservative peer’s legal team is looking for ‘substantially more’ than the £185,000 it has already agreed with the BBC for the Corporation’s botched Newsnight investigation.

Libel claims have a ‘practical ceiling’ of around £200,000 if they reach court. But ITV will be keen to avoid an expensive legal battle and could agree an even higher settlement taking into account Lord McAlpine’s costs.

This
was the extraordinary moment Philip Scholfield handed a list of alleged paedophiles
to David Cameron - which Lord McAlpine's lawyer says 'destroyed' his 
client's reputation in the process

During the live ITV broadcast Schofield handed Mr Cameron a list of names, including Lord McAlpine’s, and asked whether he would be speaking to them. Some of the names were briefly visible to viewers.

Lord McAlpine’s lawyers argue those who did not see the names could have gone to the internet and quickly found the false allegations linking him to child abuse.

Andrew Reid, McAlpine's solicitor, said in doing so the experienced presenter 'embarrassed the Prime Minister and destroyed the reputation of my client' and has sent a 15-page letter before action to ITV encouraging them to settle.

An ITV source told MailOnline that they received the letter on Thursday and will respond to it today - within the 48-hour-deadline set out in the paperwork.

Lawyers said the Lord McAlpine, pictured, case could potentially involve the largest number of defendants in British legal history

The former Tory treasurer has said because the BBC is publicly-funded he tempered the claim made against them.

But because ITV is a private company he is looking for a huge damages deal, it has emerged.

A source close to the peer told MailOnline: 'Lord McAlpine is suing ITV and he would be looking for substantially more damages than the £185,000 he got from the BBC because it is a large private organisation and not taxpayer-funded.

'Up to £500,000 is what they are looking at.'

Alan Davies, pictured, could face legal action after mentioning false child abuse allegations against Lord McAlpine

Meanwhile comedian Alan Davies is the latest celebrity to face the possibility of a lawsuit for falsely naming Tory peer Lord McAlpine on Twitter in connection with child abuse claims.

The Jonathan Creek star joins a growing number of potential defendants facing libel action which lawyers think could swell to 10,000 – the largest in British legal history.

Davies tweeted after a BBC2 Newsnight programme earlier this month which speculated about the identity of a senior Conservative accused of child abuse.

The report did not name 70-year-old Lord McAlpine.

But social networking sites were quickly awash with his name. It later emerged he had been falsely accused.

Davies, 46, tweeted to his 440,000 followers: ‘Any clues as to who this Tory paedophile is...?’

He then retweeted a response naming Lord McAlpine.

Davies, who appears on BBC2 panel show QI, refused to comment yesterday.

Others who tweeted the peer’s name include Sally Bercow, wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow.

She tweeted to her 59,000 followers on November 4: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*.’

On Friday she tweeted: ‘Yes had letter from Lord McA. His lawyers ambulance chasers tbh [to be honest] #bigbullies.’ 

BBC controversy: Lord McAlpine announced last week that he is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after BBC's Newsnight broadcast the wrong claims

Mistake: Sally Bercow took to Twitter to comment on speculation as to the identity of the Tory at the centre of a Newsnight investigation and could be sued

She later added: ‘I don’t have money to contest a multi-millionaire. Lord McA falsely accused but not by me.

‘Loving my trial by tabloid, mind. I 
never said Lord McAlpine paedophile – just noted he trending. Nor did I 
tweet about *that* Newsnight. This is totally politically motivated, I 
tell you. And I don’t do conspiracy theories as a rule.’

She went on: ‘Night twitter. Off to 
cuddle up with my lovely husband who takes so much **** (often on my 
behalf) #poor John #topspeaker #greatmanontoast.’

The peer’s lawyers have identified 
1,000 ‘original’ tweets and a further 9,000 retweets, which is when a 
user re-posts a comment sent to them.

About 40 of these potential 
defendants have so far approached the peer’s lawyers to apologise.

Mr Reid previously warned that tweeters, even those who deleted their accounts or messages, will be contacted so should come forward.

He added that it was time to clamp down on Twitter, which allowed people to say 'vile, disgusting' things.

'We have been inundated by the public who have wanted us to deal with this problem of Twitter, and have encouraged and in some cases have actually offered us funds.

'Twitter is not a place where you can gossip and say the nastiest things possible with impunity.

'We've been watching people who have been taking down what they put on Twitter. What they don't seem to understand is that once it's there, you can't take it down and what's more we really have all the information,' he said.

'Not only do we have it, but we have managed to find a couple of firms of experts who are able to produce the pre-tweets, the post-tweets, the effect of the tweets and the re-tweets.

'So what starts as a sort of maybe one (recipient) ends up as 100,000 or more in some cases.'

Twitter says information about its users that is not public will not be revealed unless they are legally required to do so.

Twitter
adds that to obtain information that is not public – including the full
name of the Twitter user and their address - would require a witness 
summons, a court order or another valid legal process.

Without
any of these, only the Twitter user’s ID – which could be a pseudonym –
and any other information they have willing disclosed will be 
available.

Lord McAlpine could now apply for an order which would enable them to obtain the private details of users who tweeted about him.

Christopher
Hutchings, a privacy lawyer, said: ‘In
the case of Lord McAlpine, the mere seriousness of the libel would mean
applying for a court order would be a straightforward application.’

His 
legal team plans to make each of them pay a nominal sum of possibly £5 
to a children’s charity.

Lord McAlpine is not expected to treat people such as Sally Bercow in the same way.

Her lawyers approached his legal team last week but were given short shrift.

A friend of the peer was reported to 
have said: ‘They tried to say she didn’t really mean any harm. We’ve 
sent them a letter before action.’

VIDEO: The astonishing moment This 
Morning presenter Phillip Schofield handed the Prime Minister a list of 
alleged Tory child abusers he found online

Friday November 2: Newsnight broadcasts a highly-anticipated investigation into historic abuse at a Welsh children's home. Victim Steve Messham (right) tells them a leading Thatcher-era Tory sexually abused him regularly. Lord McAlpine is never named but the programme leads to huge speculation online and he is named by thousands on Twitter as the subject of the report.

Tuesday November 6: Home Secretary Theresa May announces a police inquiry and a separate judge-led inquiry

Thursday November 8: In a now infamous exchange David Cameron is confronted by Phillip Schofield on This Morning, who produces a list of names he found online  - which is picked up by a camera - and hands it to his guest.

The flustered PM (below right) does not look at the list, and told the presenter 'there is a danger this could turn into a witch-hunt, particularly against people who are gay' and says anyone abused should go straight to the police.

Friday November 9: The credibility of the BBC Newsnight report collapses when The Guardian names Lord McAlpine as the subject of the botched probe and lists many reasons why he is a victim of 'mistaken identity'.

The corporation now apologises for the investigation, admits it had wrongly focused on Lord McAlpine, admitting all allegations made against him are untrue. All Newsnight investigations also stopped.

Victim Steve Messham then admits it is a case of mistaken identity, adding police showed him a picture of his abuser but had falsely said to him the man who abused him was Lord McAlpine.

The Tory peer also releases statement saying any links to him are 'wholly false and seriously defamatory'.

Saturday November 10: Director general George Entwistle has series of disastrous interviews on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 5Live and admits he did not see the Newsnight show, had missed all tweets linked to it and also the Guardian front page from the day before.

That evening he resigns and receives a £450,000 pay-off for doing the 'honourable thing' after just 54 days in the job.

Monday November 12: Lord McAlpine's legal team start putting together list of people who defamed their client and employ specialist firms to trawl Twitter for those people who named the peer online as a paedophile.

Friday November 16: BBC agrees settlement of £185,000 with Lord McAlpine who also 
breaks silence and says that he will never recover from false 
allegations. His lawyer Andrew Reid warns they will pursue every person 
who named his client online during frenzy, naming Sally Bercow (right) as 
example of someone who must apologise and settle. Reid also says ITV will be next target as he claims that the Schofield incident 'destroyed' McAlpine's reputation.
