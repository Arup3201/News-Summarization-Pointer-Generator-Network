The gothic country house film setting for Dracula and the Rocky Horror Picture Show is going on sale.

Oakley Court, which is currently used as a hotel, is being sold after the hotel business went into administration last week.

The property has 118 bedrooms, including 11 luxury suites, as well as substantial meeting and conference facilities.

For sale: Oakley Court Hotel is to go on the market after its owners went into administration

Lavish: The property comes with 118 bedrooms, including 11 luxury suites, and its own golf course

Extensive: The gothic country house was built in 1859 and has been used as a film set

Included in the asking price - which has not yet been revealed - is a
 nine-hole golf course, set in more than 37 acres of landscaped
 gardens, leading onto a private stretch of the River Thames.

Built in 1859, Oakley Court was a private residence until its last domestic owner Ernest Olivier died in 1965.

While the house stood empty for the next 14 years it was regularly used as a film set for Hammer Horror films, because it was next to Bray studios.

As well as being used in the Dracula films, it was Frank N Furter’s castle in the cult 
classic Rocky Horror Picture Show.

In 1979 it underwent conversion to a hotel and opened its doors to the public two years later.

Recently the hotel hosted several members of Team GB 
during the London 2012 Olympic Games.

Facilities: There are several conference and meeting rooms at the hotel

Conversion: The house opened as a hotel in 1981 and has since undergone several renovations

Oakley Court, in Windsor, was built in 1859, in the style of a French Chateau

Administrators KPMG said the country house hotel had a net turnover of £7.3million for the year end December 31, 2012. 

Julian Troup, Head of UK Hotels Agency at selling agent Colliers International, said: 'We are anticipating a considerable amount of 
interest from a variety of different buyers, both in the UK and from 
abroad.

'Given its impressive history, location and outstanding 
reputation there will undoubtedly be great deal of interest.

'Oakley
 Court is one of the most impressive hotel assets that has come to the 
market in recent years and its quality will drive the level of demand.'
