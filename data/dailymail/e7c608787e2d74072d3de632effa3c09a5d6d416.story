Guests at a luxury hotel where two people were found dead in a swimming pool thought investigating police were part of a murder mystery party.

The man in his 30s and woman in her early 20s were found in their swimming costumes when they were pulled from the bottom of the pool by staff staff at the four-star Down Hall Hotel on Saturday.

However, the man, in his early 30s, and the woman, who was in her early 20s, were pronounced dead at the scene.

Police are reportedly investigating 
various theories including the possibility that the pair could have been
poisoned, overcome by toxic gases or drowned.

The pair, a man in his 30s and a woman in her 20s, were discovered by a guest at about 7.30pm. Their deaths are so far 'unexplained' by police

The hotel regularly hosts murder mystery weekends and some guests reportedly believed that the arrival of police was part of the package.

Jo Carter, 49, and Frankie Heritage, 56, checked in yesterday afternoon for their first ever murder mystery and believed the whole crime scene had been staged.

Miss Carter, a personal assistant from Brentwood, Essex, said: 'We just thought it was all part of the build-up.

'We have never done a murder mystery before so we just thought they’d gone to a lot of expense.

'It all just seemed to be part of the weekend with a policemen and a van at the gate.

'It was only when we spoke to him (the police officer) and he explained that it would be much too expensive to stage with real police cars that we realised.'

Mr Heritage, a builder from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, added: 'It is absolutely terrible what has happened as that’s someone’s daughter and son.

'Last night we still had dinner but the murder mystery didn’t take place.

'All the guests were talking over dinner about how it could have happened as it is a real life mystery.'

The hotel is situated in more than 100 acres of woodland

The couple say that guests expecting 
to attend last weekend’s cancelled event have been offered a free murder
mystery at the hotel at some point in the future.

The emergency services were called to 
the country house hotel in Hatfield Heath, on the border of Essex and 
Hertfordshire, at 7.35pm on Saturday.

The air ambulance helicopter was summoned to the 110-acre estate, but paramedics could not resuscitate the man and woman.

Police said the pair from London checked in at the £150-a-night hotel together, but could not confirm if they were a couple.

Their
families have been informed but police refused to reveal their 
identities until post-mortem examinations have been carried out.

The
ten-metre pool was open to hotel guests but was unsupervised. Another 
guest said she had used the pool just 30 minutes before the bodies were 
discovered.

Essex Police interviewed guests from the two wedding parties on Saturday.

Lucy
Sparks, 21, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, was at one of the wedding 
receptions when police arrived at the hotel. She said: ‘We saw two 
police officers rush through reception with a member of staff. There 
were about five or six police cars outside and we saw the air ambulance 
land.

‘The hotel just pulled a curtain to separate us and the party still went on as normal.’

The hotel, on the Hertfordshire border, is a popular wedding venue. Jade Goody tied the knot there in 2009

Yesterday
detectives said they were not looking for anyone else in connection 
with the deaths, which they are treating as ‘unexplained’.

Chief Inspector Nick Lee said  his officers had found two people ‘submersed’ in the pool.

He
added: ‘Despite a valiant attempt from  the hotel staff and ambulance 
service, unfortunately it was not possible to revive those individuals 
and they were pronounced dead at the scene.

‘Next
of kin have been informed about this tragic incident and I can tell you
at the moment Essex Police are not looking for any other people in 
connection with this investigation.’ The man and woman were understood 
to have been in swimwear.

A
line of investigation is likely to be whether one of them suffered 
difficulties while swimming and the other drowned while attempting a 
rescue, although tests may also look to establish whether toxic gases 
were responsible.

Police have ordered toxicology tests 
to check if the pair had been drinking, although a senior officer said 
the tests were a routine part of the investigation.

Post-mortem examinations are expected to take place today and the coroner has been informed.

Down Hall Hotel is a popular wedding venue. It was used by Big Brother star Jade Goody when she married Jack Tweed.

The
estate dates back to 1322. The house itself is a 16th Century 
Italianate mansion where a silk mill owner and a Victorian member of 
Parliament once lived.

It was used as a convalescent home for wounded soldiers in the First World War and was turned into a hotel in the 1980s.

Hotel
manager Chris Falcus said: ‘We are all devastated by the tragic 
incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of those 
concerned.’
