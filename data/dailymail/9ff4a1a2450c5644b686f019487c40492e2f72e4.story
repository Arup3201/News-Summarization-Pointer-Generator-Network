Formula One ace Michael Schumacher lost control when he hit a rock and ended up smashing his head into a bolder 34 feet further down the mountain, it was revealed yesterday.

The horrific details emerged as it was announced that French investigators have ruled out any criminal wrongdoing in the freak accident.

Closing the case, Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, in charge of the inquiry, ruled 'no infraction by anyone has been turned up'.

He cleared the French ski resort of Meribel of any wrongdoing.

He
 said the accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski 
run in an off-piste area and that the resort had conformed to the French
 standards for marking ski runs.

He
 said: 'No one was found to have committed any offence. The accident 
occurred in an off-piste area. The signage, marking, staking (marker 
poles in the snow) and information provided about the edge of this slope
 were all consistent with French standards in place.'

He
 said the rock that caused him to lose balance and the rock on which he 
struck his head 'are 10.40 metres from each other and both are located 
at 4.50 metres from the boundary of the piste'.

His decision does not, however, prevent Schumacher’s family from taking civil action.

It
 was seven weeks ago yesterday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his 
life-threatening accident while skiing with his son in the French resort
 of Meribel, where he owns a chalet.

He remains in intensive care as doctors try to ease him out of an artificially-induced coma.

An investigation into the crash was launched immediately, as is usual in France for accidents of such gravity.

It was conducted by mountain police in Bourg-Saint-Maurice and gendarmes in Meribel and Albertville.

The former examined the terrain and the signage on the ski runs.

Experts
 from ENSA, the ski and climbing academy in the French ski resort of 
Chamonix, performed tests on his equipment including his skis, bindings,
 ski boots and a piece of his helmet. Tests were also conducted to see 
if the presence of his camera on his helmet had weakened the structure 
causing it to shatter so dramatically.

But his equipment was not found to be faulty in any way.

Schumacher
 had been skiing on the piste with his son and family friends. But 
shortly after 11am he 'deliberately' skied on to a patch of off-piste 
located in between two runs 'with a number of dangers, notable rocks', 
according to investigators.

It
 was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing 
fast but he lost control and catapulted on to another rock.

Lawyers
 had argued that managers of the ski resort might face up to three years
 in prison because the dangers lurking within the off-piste section were
 not properly marked.

But, 
presenting initial findings 10 days into the investigation, police chief
 Stephane Bozon said: 'The piste markers conformed to the regulations.

'Unfortunately
 this off-piste area had a number of dangers, notably the rocks being 
only barely visible, covered with five to 10 cm of snow because of the 
poor snow.'

Quincy, a former
 policeman who has been the prosecutor at Albertville since 2009, added 
that all safety procedures by mountain authorities 'had been respected'.

The
 resort hired a top lawyer, Maurice Bodecher, who is a specialist in ski
 and criminal law. Up until 2010 he was the head lawyer for the French 
Ski Federation.

The footage 
from Schumacher’s helmet camera, which includes audio, was minutely 
analyzed by N-Tec, a research division within the police at Albertville 
that specializes in new technology.

The seven-time world champion is receiving round-the-clock care in intensive case in Grenoble University Hospital.

Wife Corinna, 44, with whom the champion has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside.

His
 family issued a statement last week saying that they 'strongly believe'
 he will recover. But they admitted he was 'still in a waking-up 
process'.

The family 
said the most important element of his recovery was not the speed but 
that it progressed in a 'continuous and controlled way'.

The update came in the wake of reports that Schumacher had contracted pneumonia.

The
 statement said: "Michael's family would like to again express their 
sincere thanks for the continuous sympathy coming from all over the 
world. The good wishes they receive help the family and we are convinced
 they also help Michael, who still is in a waking up process.

'As
 often in such situation, no day is like the next. The family is 
thankful for ones understanding that they would not wish to disclose 
medical details in order to protect Michael’s privacy.

'As
 assured from the beginning we will continue to communicate any decisive
 new information on Michael’s health state. We are aware that the wake 
up phase can take a long time.

'The
 family continues to strongly believe in Michael's recovery and place 
all their trust in the doctors, nurses and nursing auxiliaries team.

'The
 important thing is not the speed of the recovery but that Michael’s 
healing process progresses in a continuous and controlled way.'

 receives food through a tube to his stomach, oxygen via a hose from a 
machine next to his bed as he still cannot breathe independently. Three 
times daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and 
bed sores.

The coma 
suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory 
drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this 
wake-up phase to see if such things are returning naturally - if at all.

His
 blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned 
and even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing. He lies on a 
special air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary 
tract is under constant vigilance because of the danger of waste 
bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing another potentially fatal 
infection.
