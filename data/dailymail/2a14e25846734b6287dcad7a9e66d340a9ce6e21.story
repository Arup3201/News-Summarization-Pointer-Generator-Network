They say that music heals the heart and soothes the soul, but for one young couple, their ballad is one of breaking up.

A young couple in Brooklyn has posted a video to YouTube detailing why they can no longer be together, singing their grievances against each other.

The answer for the split is as simple as 4/4 time: Jonathan Mann, 30, wanted kids, and his former girlfriend, Ivory King, 31, did not.

Love is reason: Mann said he wanted kids, but King did not; so they ended their relationship after five years together

The couple, who live in the ultra-hip Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn, said that posting a music video was the easiest, most pain-free way of breaking the news to their friends.

‘I didn’t want to make a post on Facebook and have that be it,’ Mr Mann told the New York Daily News.

‘And I didn’t want to have to explain it over and over to people, because that could be really painful.’

And so the two former lovebirds took to song to express their feelings. ‘I wanna have kids,’ Mr Mann begins cheerily in a major key.

But when Ms King chimes in: ‘And I really don’t,’ the song switches to minor.

‘We still love each other, but this train has stopped. We just wanted you to know, we’ve gotta break up,’ they sing, adding, ‘G**, this really sucks.’

The couple was together for five years in all. Despite their long history, the newly-single singers had sage advice for their friends: ‘Just invite us to your parties and we’ll work it out, no don’t feel weird, we love all of you,’ they sing.

They add that breaking up ‘is a mess.’

Hard to do: The video is part of his 'Song a Day' project, which has been running for more than 1,400 days now

Musical prowess: Mann played harmonica while King rocked out on the bass clarinet

The song was part of Mr Mann’s ‘Song a Day’ project, which has been running for more than 1,400 days consecutively. 

Ms King, a writer, has often helped her former beau by singing and offering her talents on the bass clarinet. 

The video has already become an internet sensation, garnering more than 34,400 views as of Thursday night.

Hundreds of people have posted their reactions to the video. One user wrote: ‘Ivory is beautiful and her eye makeup is always extremely fabulous.

'She is not selfish for not wanting to have kids; that is not a woman’s job in life.’

Another commenter sided with Mr Mann, writing: ‘Wow, it took five years for the subject to come up? Well, she seems like a really cool person anyway. Good for you to leave her.’

Bowing out: The former couple encouraged their friends to continue inviting both of them to parties and not to worry about the awkwardness
