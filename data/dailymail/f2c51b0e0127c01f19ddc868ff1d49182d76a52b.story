A council has proposed a tough new housing scheme that will prioritise workers, former servicemen and charity volunteers over those who don't make a contribution to society.

Under the controversial scheme set to be introduced by Stoke on Trent City Council, prospective tenants who work more than 12 hours a week will move to the top of the pile for social housing.

Foster parents' applications will also be fast-tracked as they too are seen as having made a contribution to the community.

Tenant Board chairman Jim Gibson, who runs Chell Heath Residents’ Association, said: 'It is important that we look after those who look after us. If someone puts themselves on the front line for their community then we ought to help them when they need our support.'

Under the scheme the council would ditch its three housing bands with five – urgent, high-need with community contribution, high-need, low-need with community contribution and low-need.

The scheme is a response to overwhelming demand. Around 6,500 people are seeking 19,000 council houses in Stoke-on-Trent but just 1,600 are typically reallocated every year, reports The Daily Express.

Councillor Janine Bridges, ­cabinet member for housing, said: 'We are keen to ensure that those families who are working or volunteering get a chance to rent low-cost accommodation close to their work.

'These aren’t just our views but reflect the views of the local ­community and the plans have been drawn up by our tenants themselves.'

The news comes as it emerged that the long-term unemployed are to be told they must do an unpaid full-time job or be stripped of their benefits.

A dramatic extension of the conditions attached to unemployment handouts  will be unveiled at the Conservative party conference next week, according to well-placed sources.

Ministers are convinced a new U.S.-style ‘work for the dole’ scheme will help to reduce  Britain’s vast benefits bill and curb the something-for-nothing culture.

It is expected that claimants who go through the Government’s main back-to-work scheme, the Work Programme, but fail to find a job, will be required to take part in unpaid community activities or work experience.

Those who refuse to do so face losing their welfare payments.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s not acceptable for people to expect to live a life on benefits if they’re able to work.’
