When photo-sharing website Instagram banned the use of hashtags using pro-anorexia keywords last April, it was widely praised.

But now British eating disorder charity, Beat, has spoken out to say the site still isn't doing enough.

Although users attempting to search keywords such as 'thinspiration' or 'proanorexia' can no longer do so, more than 300,000 images featuring frighteningly thin women or acts of self harm are still available on the site.

Despite removing more than 30,000 
graphic photos, the site's 80 million users can still access 'thinspo' 
content simply by using 'eating disorder' as the search term.

'It’s worrying that with the powerful medium of social networking and the growing popularity of phone apps such as Instagram, people are able to easily access images that encourage the individual to believe that an eating disorder is a lifestyle choice and to avoid treatment,' a Beat spokesperson told The Telegraph.

'Some sites have acted to remove content that is seen as dangerous and encouraging people to do dangerous things. Eating disorders as a lifestyle choice should be treated in the same way.'

Following the site's decision to ban 'thinspo' content, users of Instagram are being encouraged to report pro-anorexia content so the website can remove it.

'We won’t allow accounts, images, or 
hashtags dedicated to glorifying, promoting, or encouraging self-harm,' 
say the new guidelines.

'Should users come across content of 
that nature, we recommend flagging the photo or flagging the user as a 
'terms of service' violation for our support team to review.'

Nevertheless, anyone who carries out a quick search of the site today will see that thousands of the disturbing photos are still available, including a shocking image of one user, sicklyskinny's emaciated rib cage.

More worryingly still, the image received 64 'likes' from users with monikers such as 'pleaseletmebeskinny' and 'watch_me_be_skinny'.

Instagram isn't the only photo-sharing site to have fallen foul of anti-anorexia campaigners.

Pinterest and Tumblr have both come under fire for allowing picture boards and messages that feature 'pro ana' content, although the latter has taken steps to prevent 'thinspiration' being posted.

Although Instagram hasn’t disabled the search function for all eating disorder-related terms, a content advisory warning plus a link to the National Eating Disorders website appears before users are redirected to the photos.

However, users are still free to post provocative comments that glorify eating disorders and it's these that Beat wants the site to be more proactive about curbing. 

'Beat also believes that individuals should be pointed towards pro recovery sites,' the spokesperson told the Telegraph.

'Providing acceptance and support throughout society [needs to happen] so that these alternative sites are no longer the only refuge a person feels they can seek.'
