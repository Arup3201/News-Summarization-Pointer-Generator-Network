It could be a scene from an action movie - if you ignore the tie flapping awkwardly under the seat belt.

Boris Johnson clung on to a helicopter as it flew with its doors open over Hong Kong in an unlikely recreation of the film Apocalypse Now.

The London Mayor took to the skies as he again made a pitch for a new airport in London, warning the David Cameron and George Osborne are ‘kidding themselves’ if they think Britain can compete internationally without one.

Mr Johnson called on the UK Government to follow the example of Hong Kong, overcome its doubts, and give the green light to a new airport.

The Mayor pointed to Chek Lap Kok airport, an engineering marvel built on land reclaimed from the sea - much like the Mayor's plans for a so-called ‘Boris island’ - as an example of what could be achieved with a new airport to the east of London.

Looking out over its two runways, Mr Johnson claimed the situation in Hong Kong in the early 1990s when the old urban airport had no room for expansion was similar to the one currently facing Britain with a third Heathrow runway a controversial and, he claims, unworkable option.

The Mayor warned that there was a risk of a ‘convulsive heave’ from the British Establishment that would end with the ‘catastrophic’ building of a third Heathrow runway but said Mr Osborne's attitude to big infrastructure projects like high-speed rail indicated he might be persuaded to build a new airport.

Chancellor Mr Osborne was due to land in Hong Kong shortly after Mr Johnson as the pair come to the end of their separate trade missions to China.

Looking out over the misty bay in Hong Kong, Mr Johnson told reporters: ‘I do think there is a risk that what's going to happen basically is that at the end of this year they're going to keep the Heathrow third runway option in the mix, there will then be an election and there will then be one last convulsive heave by the Treasury and by the CBI and the British Establishment generally to impose another runway on west London and that would be absolutely catastrophic.

‘People say that's the only thing we can do in the short-term, actually in reality that won't be delivered, even if you got going now on the third runway it wouldn't be until 2028 and you'd be massively compounding the economic damage in west London.

‘Why not get it right from the off as they have in Hong Kong? Why not take the long-term decision? Think long-term, that is what we should be doing.’

Landing: Mr Johnson hit back at reports a senior Cabinet minister had dismissed his dream of a brand new hub airport being built

He went on: ‘There is a recidivist instinct in the Treasury and the CBI amongst people.’

Asked if it was shared by the Chancellor, he said: ‘I don't think so. I think if you look at the Chancellor's record, his personal commitment to big infrastructure projects such as HS2, I think in principle he could well be on for it.

‘I think the trouble is that there are a large number of people in the Treasury and elsewhere who basically think 'little old us, we can't do something like that, we can't compete with China in that way' and I think that is negative, I think that doesn't show sufficient ambition for this country.’

Mr Johnson wants a four-runway airport either built in the Thames Estuary on an island reclaimed from the sea or on the Isle of Grain in Kent's Hoo Peninsula - as outlined by architect Lord Foster. Another option would involve expanding Stansted to make it a four-runway airport.

Touchdown: Mr Johnson said Chinese investment in big projects proved his ambitions were right for the future

The Mayor said a new airport would serve the country for generations to come.

He said: ‘At the moment we in London are losing business to other European airports, our business people cannot get off to these mainland Chinese destinations.

‘One thing that has really come through to me loud and clear in the last few days is that if you have the will and the determination you can do it.

‘I was amazed to hear somebody in Government say we can't possibly build a new airport, that's a kind of Chinese thing to do.

‘Well, the Chinese are showing us that that is the approach we have got to have in the future.

‘Aviation accounts for about 60 per cent of Hong Kong's economic output at the moment and if we followed this route we would not only be solving a critical noise pollution problem in west London, but we would also be creating a logistics hub that would serve our city, our country, for generations to come.’
