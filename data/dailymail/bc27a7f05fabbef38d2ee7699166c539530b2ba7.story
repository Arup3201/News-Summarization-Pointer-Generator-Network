A mysterious circle of ancient stones looming high over the Wiltshire countryside, prehistoric Stonehenge is one of Britain's most spectacular sights.

But taking your eyes off the A344 to gawp at the view as you drive past the towering monoliths could come at a price.

Stonehenge has topped a list of sights around the country most likely to cause awestruck drivers to have an accident - with the Angel of the North and the Blackpool Tower also responsible for many a swerve or bump.

Distracting: Over a quarter of drivers surveyed said the sight of Stonehenge had distracted them to the point of peril

The study showed that a third of drivers in the UK have had a minor accident or near miss after taking their eyes off the road to admire a landmark or view as they passed, often causing hundreds of pounds worth of damage to their cars.

It seems nowhere in the country is as diverting to drivers as the curious circle of Stonehenge, with over a quarter of people surveyed admitting the ancient monument had them distracted to the point of danger, and 13 per cent confessing to a minor accident or close shave.

Research showed Stonehenge can lure a driver's gaze up to three times in a single passing - for up to 3.74 seconds of staring each time.

The famous 66ft Angel of the North in Gateshead, which towers over the roads into Tyneside, was named as the second most dangerous view for drivers, with 11.5 per cent of motorists reporting a prang or a near miss as they gazed at the sculpture.

Third on the list was Blackpool Tower, with 11.3 per cent of drivers surveyed reporting a minor accident as a result of concentrating on the iconic tourist attraction instead of the road.

The Scottish Highlands, Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, and London's imposing Houses of Parliament are also potentially dangerously distracting to drivers, according to the research carried out by More Than Motor Insurance.

The study also showed that drivers slow down dramatically as they pass landmarks in order to get a better look.

In
all, 14 per cent of motorists surveyed said they had been so spellbound
by some sights they slowed down by up to 27mph - increasing their 
chances of being rear-ended by another car behind.

Drivers
taking advantage of scenic routes are now being encouraged to park up 
to admire a spectacular view rather than risk taking their attention off
the road.

Historic Windsor Castle was sixth on the list of dangerous views, distracting ten per cent of passing drivers, while Tower Bridge in London was at number seven and caused nine per cent of motorists to tear their gaze from the road.

Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol was at number eight, with Cheddar Gorge at nine and the Severn Bridge at number ten in the table.

Janet Connor, managing director of the insurance provider, said: 'We're often encouraged by travel guides and even our friends and family to take the scenic route. But until now the perils of admiring the world beyond the windscreen had not been fully explored.

'The UK is blessed with some amazing sights and landmarks, but as this research suggests, motorists need to resist the lure of taking their eyes off the road and staring at those sights while driving.

She added: 'Our advice to motorists is simple: to avoid having an accident while appreciating the view, park up and enjoy it safely.'
