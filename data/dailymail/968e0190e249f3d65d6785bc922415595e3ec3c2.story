Condemned: Angry viewers says Neil Warnock's comments reinforced a homophobic stereotype

A Premier League manager has been accused of homophobia after he criticised his team for playing 'like fairies'.

Furious viewers said the comment from QPR boss Neil Warnock on BBC sports show Match of the Day Live was a stereotype and should not have been screened.

The BBC's complaints department agreed the remark was unwelcome and apologised that it had not been redressed while the programme had been on air.

It said it would not take any further action because programme-makers had already 'expressed regret'.

Warnock's comments came in a TV interview broadcast on April 23, after his team's 2-2 draw with Cardiff City.

He said: 'We defended like fairies in the first half but the first two goals could have come straight out of the Premier League.'

The BBC's editorial complaints unit (ECU) said: 'The remark was unacceptable, and it was a matter of regret that it had gone unnoticed by the programme-makers, and therefore without comment or apology, at the time.

'However, the programme-makers had already acknowledged the unacceptability of the remark and expressed regret that it had not been dealt with appropriately.

'In the view of the ECU, this was sufficient to resolve the matter.'

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'This was a live interview of which we had no editorial control.

'The BBC acknowledge the unacceptability of the remark and apologise that it had not been dealt with appropriately on air at the time.'
