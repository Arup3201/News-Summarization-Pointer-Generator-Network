A 70-year-old woman has opened up about her own 'sexual awakening', 15 years after her husband died.

Lynn Brown Rosenberg, a self-confessed 'sexually conservative nice Jewish girl' from California, revealed in a candid essay for Salon that at age 69 she 'was practically a virgin' because of her own sexual repression.

But now she wanted 'mad, passionate, down-and-dirty sex' and was willing to try anything in order to experience the 'excitement' she had been missing her entire life.

It wasn't long before Ms Rosenberg found free dating sex websites where she signed up a Sensualnights16 and listed her age as 63, with a picture that showed her 'lips, chin and breasts underneath a T-shirt' (pictured)

Ms Rosenberg's urologist suggested she get a vibrator and start with some porn.

'Thirty years ago I couldnâ€™t imagine myself stooping that low,' she confessed. 'And I didnâ€™t have a high regard for porn, either, labeling it as disgusting.'

But forcing herself out of her comfort zone, she visited the West Hollywood specialty store Pleasure Chest and decided to try something called 'Budding Bliss'. 

'I bought a porn DVD. Why not? If I was going to stoop, why not stoop all the way?' she said, adding that much to her surprise, she began to have orgasms.

'It became my new hobby,' she confessed.

But after two weeks, she found herself needing 'greater or different stimuli' to be able to climax.

Ms Rosenberg's therapist guided her to free Internet porn ('My horizons were expanding,' she states) and after several research attempts she stumbled across a few videos that she began to watch 'many times'.

'The
 way the man moaned and sighed affected me immensely,' Ms Rosenberg 
explains. 'I discovered I loved watching a man and hearing his 
expression of release so much so that I wanted to get inside the video 
myself. I wanted to be the woman pleasuring him.'

It wasn't long before she found free dating sex websites where Ms Rosenberg signed up a Sensualnights16 and 
listed her age as 63, 'rationalizing that the further away
 from 70 I was, the more men I would interest. This was the only thing I
 lied about,' she insisted, adding that she even posted a picture.

'Each time I took a new step in my 
sexual exploration I became fearful. What was I getting myself into?  
Was I going to get into trouble?'

'But not 
wanting my face shown on a sex site, I posted one in which a hat was 
pulled down over my eyes.  All it showed were my lips, chin and breasts 
underneath a T-shirt,' she said.

After a 33-year-old man named Bill contacted her, Ms Rosenberg decided to give the chat a try -- despite their age difference.

'Each time I took a new step in my sexual exploration I became fearful. What was I getting myself into?  Was I going to get into trouble?' she asked.

'Yet, despite my fears, I convinced myself to keep going. To utter these forbidden words -- c***, p***, f*** -- was liberating. No, exhilarating! Walls broke down.

'No longer would I be constricted by what I was supposed to think, supposed to do, supposed to feel.'

Referring to notes she had taken down from several of her favorite porn videos, Ms Rosenberg began to type. 'Would you like me to take the tip of your c*** inside my mouth?' she wrote to Bill.

'My heart was racing. I was embarrassed! Excited! Writing word for word, question after question what the woman in the [porn] video said, I was breaking with all propriety, everything I learned from my parents on how to be a nice Jewish girl,' Ms Rosenberg confessed.

She decided to join a second site, this time listing her age as 45. 'I wanted to see if the lowered age would make a difference and it did.  I was flooded with requests to chat,' she said, adding that she 'rejected all men who werenâ€™t smiling'.

'[Men] talked dirty to me -- very dirty -- and I learned how much I liked it,' she said.

'I had two glasses of wine before logging on, and as [they] said words to me that no one had ever said, I began to go off-script. I was finally getting the hang of this. Our conversations were raw. Graphic. Forbidden. Exciting.'

Ms Rosenberg explains that she is still in the process of 'finding herself' sexually, but that her communication online has helped her to be more sexually explicit -- both in and out of bed.

'I never would have guessed this is how my sexual awakening would take place. But at 70 years old, I was finally free.'
