In the latest instalment of his weekly column, chief sports writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver...

WHAT'S HOT

Mob justice

Ten days ago, Sheffield United announced convicted rapist Ched Evans would be training with them, as he bids to restart his career in football, following his rape conviction. Dismissing those that considered this unwise, the club issued a high-minded statement: 'In a nation of laws, served by an elected parliament and duly constituted courts of law, there can be no place for "mob justice".'

On Thursday, following the resignation of several club patrons and sponsors, widespread disgust and Jessica Ennis-Hill's statement that she would no longer wish a Bramall Lane stand to be named after her if Evans returned to the club full-time, 'mob justice' would appear to have found its place after all.

Confirming that Evans's training privileges had been withdrawn, Sheffield United said: 'Members of the Board have consulted dispassionately with the club's supporters, vice presidents, Community Foundation members, executives, staff, sponsors and other relevant stakeholders in order to help it reach this decision. The club initially accepted a request from the PFA for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced.'

Actually, it could. A first-year GCSE Media Studies student could have called this one. Still, at least we know where Sheffield United stand. Against mob justice. Unless it's a really big mob.

Judy Murray

Travelling up to Glasgow this week, I bumped into Judy Murray fresh from her memorable turn on Strictly Come Dancing. She wasn't the best mover. We know that. But she was a fantastic sport – and the British public love that even more.

Between posing for countless selfies with admirers, she said she realised how big the programme was when after the first episode she went up to watch the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles and was forced to abandon walking the course a hundred yards down the first fairway.

I said she did well to survive the backlash from son Andy's declaration for Scottish independence. 'He said if I got voted out in the first week, it would be all his fault,' Judy confirmed. 'I told him not to be so silly. If I went out in the first week it would be because I was s****.' A true mum, Judy Murray. Marvellous.

Nathaniel Clyne

Come on, let's face it, you were never happy with Glen Johnson, were you? When Fabio Capello said he was one of the best right backs in the world, it was the first sign the England manager was losing it.

Yet who else was there? Kyle Walker? Worse. Phil Jones or Chris Smalling. Central defenders at heart. John Stones. Not yet. Southampton fans have been raving about Clyne for over a year now, and this week he took his chance.

He was beaten for pace by Scotland's Ikechi Anya early on at Parkhead. But only the once. After that, Anya barely got a kick and was eventually substituted. Lee Dixon, no slouch at right-back himself, was raving about Clyne's defensive strengths after the game. Danny Mills said the way he reacted to Anya's threat, adapted and won the day, was the hallmark of a good player. One imagines England coach Gary Neville might know a good full-back, too. Problem solved? Let's hope so.

WHAT'S NOT

Dave Whelan

You are the chairman of Wigan Athletic. You have just made a controversial managerial appointment, engaging a man currently under Football Association investigation for using racially charged and homophobic language, albeit in private conversations. What do you do? That's right: deflect attention from him, by repeating the same material yourself in an interview with a left-leaning newspaper.

Whelan thinks everyone calls the Chinese 'Chinks' and it is a statement of fact that Jews chase money. He probably doesn't see the harm in slurs and stereotypes, even now.

So here's a reminder of where it leads. This is a page from an educational book, Der Giftpilz, published in Germany in 1938. The first line of the narrative beneath reads, 'The God of the Jew is money.' Not so far from what Whelan said, if you think about it.

Anti-Republican Chanting

F*** the IRA? Of course. F*** all terrorists. F*** anyone who so lacks empathy for their fellow man that they can slaughter, not combatants, but innocents. Yet is this really a message that needs underlining during England internationals?

When Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored his first goal for England in more than a year on Tuesday, he might have thought it would have been received with more than a reminder of a bloody chapter in British history, thankfully resolved. It has nothing to do with football. Stop it.

Radamel Falcao

Another two weeks out. So now we know for certain. There was no plan. There was no grand scheme, no brilliant strategy. Manchester United went for the marquee names that were available, and here is the consequence. They bought a very expensive, injury prone, player in a position that was already well staffed. Still, no doubt Twitter was abuzz.
