Gangs have been stripping away LED headlights from luxury Range Rovers and using them to grow cannabis in the latest car crime trend.

In the past month there have been a spate of thefts with the costly lights targeted by criminals, prompting police to launch a special investigation, dubbed Operation Emporia, to deal with the thefts.

Victims say the thefts can be completed in as little as 30 seconds and calls have been made for manufacturer Land Rover to take action.

Stolen: The front headlights and grill of this Range Rover, owned by Michael Roper, were among those taken by thieves in Bradford, West Yorkshire

One theory is that the powerful headlights - costing around £1,000 each - are being stolen to be used in cannabis production.

Michael Roper, 53, licensee of the Dog
 and Gun in Oxenhope, had the lights and front grille stolen from his 
Range Rover Sport outside his pub in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on April 16.

He said the crooks caused £8,000 in damage to his vehicle.

'It is rife,' he said.

'But
 it is such an easy crime - it is so fast. It took them about ten 
minutes maximum. They put a crowbar in between the front wing and the 
headlights.

'They wrecked the wing. There was no noise. They know how to disable the alarm on the cars.'

Mr Roper said he knew of at least 40 other Range Rovers in the area that had been targeted in similar thefts.

'The rumour circulating among other victims is that the headlights are being used to cultivate cannabis.

'I’m not sure how it would work, presumably because they are quite strong.'

'But it could be more simple in that they’re stealing them to order so they can put them on other vehicles.'

He added: 'I've heard the lights are being shipped abroad, then sold on eBay to come back over here.'

He has now fitted his own security measures to his car to prevent similar thefts in future.

Mr
 Roper said the the garage where he took his car to be repaired reported
 at least ten other damaged vehicles following similar thefts, and that a
 supplier had also been targeted.

Peter Earwaker, of Bingley Car Bodyshop, said: 'The manufacturers have got to take the brunt of the blame.

'It is far too easy - it can take 30 to 60 seconds to steal a full set of headlights and grille from a Range Rover.'

On April 30, during a theft from a 
Range Rover in a car park in Bradford city centre, a witness who tried 
to intervene was threatened with a knife.

The woman owner spoke of her fear at driving her £60,000 car and also insisted Land Rover had to do something.

She said: 'I am frustrated because I feel like Land Rover should be recalling vehicles. It is so easy to get the grille and the lights out - that is a design fault.'

West Yorkshire police Chief Inspector Suzanne Akeroyd said one of the other motives of the gangs was to use the parts to fit to other vehicles.

'West Yorkshire Police is taking this issue very seriously and recently launched Operation Emporia specifically to target the theft of 4x4 vehicle parts,' she said.

'That work has already had some significant success with a number of people arrested and stolen parts recovered.

'Officers are also working closely with manufacturers and using a range of tactics to target the thieves and those who deal in stolen car parts.'

Land Rover said they were investigating the problem.
