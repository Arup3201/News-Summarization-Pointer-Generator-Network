Lying in a bridal gown friends gather around the open casket of a teenage AIDS victim in the sewers below Bucharest.

Catalina collapsed and died in the tunnels below the city last week and friends and family came to pay their last respect to the 18-year-old, who was dressed in a wedding gown, as is the custom for Roma girls who die before they marry.

The extraordinary pictures of her wake and funeral procession in the underground tunnel system, which is home to a gang of drug addicts, were captured by Channel 4 News reporters Paraic O'Brien and Jim Wickens.

The reporters exposed the underground world in the Romania in a film last month, but they returned to city following the death of Catalina, a drug addict who featured in the report.

This is their story.

Victim: People gather around the coffin of 18-year-old Catalina, an AIDS victim, who died in the underground tunnels of Bucharest

Last respects: Friends gather around the casket of Catalina, who is dressed in a wedding gown, as is custom for Roma girls, who die before they marry

Burial: A small crowd, weeping and placing flowers over the casket surrounded the final resting place of Catalina as her coffin is lowered into the ground

Deep beneath the streets of Romania’s capital, a living hell exists. The last time we met Catalina had been underground, deep in the Bucharest tunnel system that Bruce Lee and his gang of homeless drug addicts call home.

She was in the queue to buy drugs, perched on one of the heating pipes in front of an icon of the Virgin Mary. The ring of infected syringe sores around her neck a jagged reminder of her drug-addicted life in the sewers. 'This is where I destroyed myself', she had told us almost prophetically that day.

She featured as one of the main characters in our film broadcast on Channel 4 News last month. A story that has shocked over two million people who have viewed it around the world and has ramped up the pressure on authorities charged with managing Romania’s homeless youngsters.

The mourners carried photographs of Catalina, as well as a cross and religious imagery during her funeral procession

But it is 
too late for Catalina. She is dead. She collapsed and died in the 
tunnels last week after suffering from AIDS, chronic pneumonia and heart
 failure which cut short her painfully short life. She had just turned 
18.

Channel
 4 News was invited back to Romania and to her wake. We were ushered 
through the cobble stones and courtyard, past children playing in the 
dust and adults weeping by the door of the tiny tin roofed shack.

Catalina
 lay in the open casket veiled in a bridal gown, as is custom for Roma 
girls who die before their wedding day. A priest stood to one side, 
chanting prayers as her sisters stood over her, fussing over the veil, 
or rearranging her beloved pink CD player that they had stuffed under 
her pillow, music to keep her company in the grave.

During the procession, mourners stopped at the at the sewer entrance, which led to the place she once called home

The sewers are home to hundreds of homeless people, with many HIV positive and drug addicts

The so-called 'king of the sewers' Bruce Lee, right, attended Catalina's funeral with his head painted in Aurolac, a bright silver paint that the addicts sniff

Authorities in Bucharest say Bruce Lee has been removed from the city several times by the police but keeps on returning faster than the police return to take him away

As the 
candles flickered late into the night, Catalina's friends began to 
arrive in the house, familiar faces from her home in the tunnels coming 
to pay their last respects.

We
 found Eliza, one of Catalina's best friends whom we filmed joking 
around in the tunnels weeks earlier. 'We met in a foster house named 
Pinocchio. I hanged out with her everywhere. She was like a sister to 
me,' she told us tears streaming down her face.

One
 of five siblings born into acute poverty, Catalina's parents had 
abandoned her as a baby, sending her to live in a children's institution
 on the edge of Bucharest, for the first years of her life.

It was a factor we were told later by the head of the institution that had impacted deeply upon her life, a lifetime lacking in love that had drawn her deeply into life within the sewers. Bruce Lee and the tight knit gang underground she said had become the family Catalina had never had.

'For her getting some attention was an extraordinary experience,' said Carmen her sister, 'because now she felt valued in those moments. She was happy if anybody was looking out for her or giving her any attention,' she said.

The underground world of homeless people living in the sewers and tunnels beneath Bucharest was exposed by Channel 4 News last month

Everyone living in the sewers is HIV-positive and a quarter have TB, yet they are left to rot in the darkness, huddling against heating pipes and sniffing glue to stay warm

Some even keep pets such as this dog in the tunnels, even though there is barely enough room for all the people living beneath the city

The procession of mourners continued to stream in, silent faces, clutching her hand, kissing her forehead, whispering their goodbyes.

The following morning, the day of Catalina’s funeral, it was the turn of Bruce Lee – the self-styled 'King of the Sewers'.

Never shy of a spectacle, he arrived barefoot with his head painted in Aurolac, a luminous helmet of bright silver paint that the addicts sniff. A stark reminder of the crazed drug-infested atmosphere where Catalina had died.

A window was removed from the house and the coffin was pulled out amidst wails and mournful chaos. Carried in the back of an open transit van, a small gaggle of mourners led a slow march to the Gare Du Nord, stopping at the sewer entrance, the hole she had once called home.

For a hearse, a black transit van. Then a procession through the city, where the pallbearers were drug addicts.

Many of the drug addicts sniff 
a metallic paint called Aurolac and the smell of the substance is overpowering in the tunnels

The same sewer entrance we had disappeared into weeks earlier appears empty. Nobody stirred until her sister calls down into the tunnel: 'Catalina is here, this is where she lived with you, come and see her for the last time.'

Gradually they begin to emerge, weary-eyed in the bright light above ground, clutching Aurolac bags to steady their nerves. A gaggle of diseased and destitute individuals who have lost their way in life, gathering around the body of one of their own who had lost her life.

We followed the group to the funeral where Catalina’s coffin was lowered into the ground. A small crowd surrounded her coffin, weeping and placing flowers over the casket. Her family she was torn from as a baby and the homeless family that had welcomed her in - briefly united in a moment of tragedy.

The next day we interviewed Cosmina Nicolescu, the Director General of the Social Assistance in Bucharest who told us: 'For them life no longer matters. They are outcasts, renegades that are avoided and they are primarily lacking love and understanding.  It wasn't their fault that they were born into this situation, or that they ended up in this situation.'

The homeless and drug gangs enter the underworld via a hole in the pavement on a traffic island in front of the station

We asked why more wasn't done to intervene before Catalina's death: 'As far as we know from the tunnels she didn't want to be brought in the daylight. Her dying wishes, to die in the place where she had found family.'

Ms Nicolescu says that they can't close the tunnels, for fear of pushing the vulnerable people who find sanctuary underground, into ever-more precarious places and situations. 

But she claims that Bruce Lee is banned from Bucharest, and has been removed several times before by the police. He just keeps on returning faster than the police return to take him away.

Today the tunnels alongside Bucharest's central station remain open for both business and sanctuary, attracting youngsters like Catalina, who struggle to exist at the very bottom of Romanian society.

Drug addiction and premature death the price paid for those who choose to live underground.

Watch 'Catalina: A Life Lost in the Tunnels of Bucharest' in a special report on Channel 4 News tonight at 7pm.

The leader of the underground world, Bruce Lee, pays protection money to a local gang and also says addicts are less likely to die down in the tunnels because he offers them a sort of safety
