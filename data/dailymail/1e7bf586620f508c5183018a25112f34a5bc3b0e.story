Inter Milan have openly admitted their interest in landing Tom Ince when his contract expires - and claimed he is mulling over a move.

The Blackpool winger, who has been on loan at Crystal Palace since January, is weighing up several offers from clubs across Europe.

Piero Ausilio, technical director at Inter, claims that while a deal for Ince is by no means a forgone conclusion, the club are keen to land him.

On the hunt! Inter Milan have admitted their interest in signing Blackpool winger Tom Ince

Making waves: Ince has been on loan at Crystal Palace from Blackpool since the January transfer window

Ince is 22, meaning that even though he is available on a free transfer, any club wanting to sign him would have to pay the Seasiders some compensation via a tribunal.

That figure would be in the millions if a Premier League side agreed a move, but severely reduced if Ince were to go abroad, where he may command a fee of just £155,000.

'He's a young player with an expiring contract who is weighing up several offers,' Ausilio said on Saturday.

'It's definitely not a done deal for Ince. It's an intriguing possibility, him coming here in his father's footsteps.'

Paul - who managed Tom at Blackpool last season - spent two years at the San Siro in between spells at Manchester United and Liverpool.

Tony Pulis is weighing up a move for Ince, even though he failed to nail down a first team spot at Palace in the final months of the season, while Monaco and Olympiacos remain interested.

Ince has been offered a new contract at Bloomfield Road - in a bid by the club to protect their right to compensation - but will not sign it. 

You're not alone! Inter are one of a number of clubs who are keen on landing Ince for a nominal fee
