A teenage beauty queen was left in tears after being banned from her school prom for skipping lessons and bad behaviour.

Lurelle Bancroft, 16, was turned away at the gates in her £300 dress after ignoring teachers’ warnings that she would not be let in.

She claimed she was left traumatised and deserved to go to the dance because her achievement in reaching the Miss Teen Great Britain finals had given the school a good name.

Blacklisted Beauty Queen Lurelle, who has reached the finals of Miss Teen Great Britain, wept as she was blocked from entering

But staff at Buile Hill Visual Arts 
College in Salford say that Lurelle – who wants to be a model – missed 
classes, was often late, swore at teachers and refused to stay behind 
for detentions.

‘She was given two written warnings 
saying she couldn’t go to the prom unless she behaved better at school 
and each time she ripped them up in front of the teachers,’ said a 
source.

Why Lurelle bothered to try to get 
into the end-of-year dance last week – and let her distress be filmed on
a mobile phone – remains a mystery because she was told months ago she 
would not be let in.

Five days earlier, she had posted on 
Twitter: ‘Going to kill me seeing all my girls looking beautiful on 
Friday at prom knowing I’m not aloud [sic].’

Her mother called children's services before the prom in a bid to overturn the school's 'disgusting' decision

Was school right to turn away beauty queen from prom for skipping classes?

Yesterday, Lurelle, whose idols 
include Debbie O’Toole from reality TV show Desperate Scousewives and 
Coleen Rooney, was believed to be on holiday in Cyprus with her 
boyfriend.

Her mother Candice Bancroft, 36, said
she called Salford’s children’s services before the prom to try to 
overturn the school’s ban on Lurelle and to complain her daughter was 
being ‘victimised’.

‘I had the dress made by a fashion 
designer in Manchester, she was so sure she was going,’ said Mrs 
Bancroft, of Swinton, Manchester.

Before going on holiday, Lurelle told her local newspaper: ‘I deserved to be there [at the prom].

‘Over the last year I’ve raised 
money  for charity and represented the school  as Miss Teen Salford and 
I’ve given the school a good name. In the end all I could do was cry my 
eyes out, I was  so distressed.’

Lurelle's mother said the school's act followed months of 'victimisation' after her daughter won a beauty crown

Headmaster James Inman said: ‘Lurelle was told she would not be allowed to attend the prom in March.’ 

Pupils had decided that it was not an
entitlement but a privilege to attend the prom, he said, and a points 
system was used. Under it, Lurelle needed 80 points to go to the prom.

Her 87 per cent attendance record 
gave her 87 points and she gained 13 more for achievement – but she lost
69 points for her bad behaviour, ending on only 31 points.

It meant that she was one of three pupils to be barred from going to the prom.
