It’s a chocoholic’s worst nightmare: a disease ravages cocoa crops, causing a worldwide chocolate shortage and the price of sweets to soar.

But a steamy greenhouse near London is helping to ensure that cocoa crops around the world remain disease-free.

The International Cocoa Quarantine Centre (ICQC) is nurturing quarantined cocoa plants so that they can be shared with cocoa-producing countries to produce new, more disease-resistant varieties.

Inside the ICQC, the plants thrive tropical conditions where the air is a balmy 23°C (73 °C).

‘Cocoa plants are generally quite difficult plants to grow,’ said Heather Lake, a technician at the newly-revamped centre, which is funded half by the British chocolate industry and half by the US government.

‘They don't like too much sunlight, they don't like too much shade. It's quite difficult to get the climate correct.’

Hosted by the University of Reading and situated in the village of Arborfield, west of London, the ICQC boasts 400 cocoa plant varieties, grown in 10,760 square feet (1,000 square metres) of greenhouse space.

At a time when changing tastes in emerging economies like China and India are fuelling global demand for chocolate(stock image), the centre acts as a vital resource for producer countries when pests or droughts strike crops

Chocolate drinks were made as early in 1,900BC.

The Mokaya and pre-Olmec people of Mesoamerica first roasted and ground cocoa beans to make 'chocolate'.

The Aztecs believed that cacao seeds were the gift of Quetzalcoatl, the God of wisdom, and the seeds had so much value they were used as a form of currency.

The Latin name for the cocoa tree is Theobroma Cacao which means ‘Food of the Gods’.

Originally prepared as a drink, chocolate was served as a bitter, frothy liquid and was often mixed with spices, wine or corn.

It was believed to give the drinker strength and boost their libido.

Sugar was first added to cocoa in the 16th century when chocolate became popular the form we now recognise.

It was originally only eaten by the rich. Chocolate houses sprang up in London in the seventeenth century and were frequented by the upper classes - by 1700 there were 2,000 in the capital.

By the 20th century, the sweet was popular with all classes and chocolate was considered a staple and featured in war ration packs.

The UK has the seventh highest consumption of chocolate in the world.

The average Briton eats 17.49lbs (8kg) of chocolate per year, according to The World Atlas of Chocolate, but Switzerland takes the top spot. A total of 40 per cent of chocolate is consumed in Europe.

Its aim is to reduce the amount of diseases affecting cocoa plants by quarantining them before sharing them with different countries to produce new, more resistant varieties.

Diseases such as Black Pod and Mirid can decimate valuable crops.

Andrew Daymond, manager of the ICQC, told MailOnline that there are various fungal diseases of cocoa such as blackpod, which is found worldwide, witches broom disease in South America and frosty pod rot, which is found in Central America and parts of South America.

'These all spread by fungal spores. Another disease that it important in West Africa is Cocoa Swollen Shoot virus. This is spread by insect vectors.'

Most of the efforts to increase cocoa supply are geared towards improving yields on existing farms rather than increasing the area cultivated.

Breeding of improved varieties that have better resistance to pests and diseases and higher yield potential is one route to achieve this and at the same time improve farmer livelihoods.

The plants in the greenhouse were grown from cuttings or seeds collected from disease-free crops in the wild, on expeditions to the tropics.

At a time when changing tastes in emerging economies like China and India are fuelling global demand for chocolate, the centre acts as a vital resource for producer countries when pests or droughts strike crops.

‘That's where we come into play,’ said Dr Daymond, which was set up 30 years ago. ‘We are the main hub for international movements of cocoa plants.’

New plants are needed because almost three quarters of the world’s cocoa is grown in West Africa, despite originating from South America, according to the International Cocoa Organisation. 

Such a heavy concentration of production in one region - the Ivory Coast and Ghana alone represent 60 percent - makes it vulnerable to shocks. 

For example, the price of cocoa jumped to almost $3,400 (£2,202) a tonne in September, amid fears that the Ebola crisis in West Africa could affect cocoa supplies.

Both Ivory Coast and Ghana have so far been spared by the outbreak, but Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, which collectively produce 0.7 per cent of the world’s cocoa, saw their yields plummet when the disease struck.

Cocoa prices later rebounded, and even rose 15 per cent overall, last year.

There is also the potential threat to the industry from plant diseases, which in West Africa can mean up to one third of the annual harvest is lost.

Dr Daymond explained: ‘In each cocoa-growing country, they face particular challenges to do with pest and diseases, low yield potential of planted materials, extreme weather events.

‘The basic objective of the project is to allow safe movement of cocoa plants from one part of the world to another.’

Because Britain has no endemic pests or diseases affecting cocoa, the centre can grow resistant varieties before dispatching them around the world.

The current quarantine procedure involves experts looking for signs of disease over a two year period, but research is under way to speed up the process.

‘When we do an export, we send the small branches off a tree…we then remove all the leaves and we just send a stick,’ Dr Daymond said.

He explained that producer countries can then ‘establish a plant that is genetically identical to the plant that they received the cutting from’.

The centre also researches the effects of climate change on cocoa crops and is looking at developing new varieties that would be more resistant to droughts or increased carbon dioxide levels, in a bid to meet the demand for chocolate.

Experts at Kew Gardens are advising the coffee industry how to grow more resilient plants, amid fears that the Arabica variety will be wiped out by the end of the century.

The Ethiopian bean - the world’s most popular type of coffee - is severely threatened by drought.

With dry weather predicted to become more frequent in east Africa, Arabica plants could be eradicated in the wild by 2080, experts say.

This is because those growing in coffee plantations are from limited genetic stock and are unlikely to have the flexibility required to cope with repeated dry spells and other threats, such as pests and diseases.

Now horticulturists from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew are finding alternative species and educating coffee giants.

Professor Kathy Willis, head of science at Kew, said: ‘We’re finding alternative species and talking to Starbucks and Sainsbury’s and other big coffee importers and producers so that information flows through to big business.

‘By 2050-2080 there could be a 100 per cent reduction in Arabica coffee in the wild because of the dry, so we will need to move to the other 124 species of coffee.’

She said Kew coffee research head Aaron Davis was looking in countries such as Madagascar for more resistant strains of coffee that can be grown with better climatic tolerance than Arabica, but lots of the varieties found there taste ‘horrible’.

While there are almost 125 species of coffee, Arabica is the most popular by far and is considered the most important global commodity, after oil.

Kew is setting up a new company in May called Kew Consultancy Services to sell commercially useful information.

‘We are focusing Kew’s science in those areas where we can truly make a unique impact on people’s lives, thanks to our unrivalled collection of specimens and the world-leading expertise of our evolutionary botanists, mycologists, taxonomists and systematists, Professor Willis said.

Kew has cut 100 jobs in the last eight months - half from the science department - after a cut in Government funding.
