Vile internet trolls branded murder suspect Dale Cregan a ‘legend’ yesterday as they continued to pay homage to him on twisted ‘tribute pages’.

Social networking websites have been awash with comments praising one-eyed Cregan since his arrest – as well as messages attacking the two murdered policewomen.

Trolls on Facebook called him ‘Sir Dale’. Last night, the website’s administrators were criticised for failing to remove the offensive content fast enough.

A webpage describing murder suspect Dale Cregan as 'the greatest legend since Raoul Moat' has been put up on Facebook

Several ‘tribute’ sites were deleted 
on Tuesday night but were created again yesterday morning and were live 
for more than five hours.

Numerous people said they had reported
the content to both Facebook and Greater Manchester Police.

Julie Reid,
councillor for Gorton South in Manchester, wrote on Twitter: 
‘Absolutely disgusting Facebook page Dale Cregan Legend needs to be 
taken down. Some appalling comments’.

On the page entitled ‘Dale Cregan Legend’, someone wrote that Cregan was ‘the greatest legend’.

The pages appeared to be set up anonymously, although some of those commenting appeared to be using their own names.

attending a report of a burglary in the Hattersley area of Greater Manchester

On a page entitled ‘Sir Dale Cregan Is A Hero and a Legend’, Lee McDonald wrote: ‘Haha beauty. And he only had the one eye.’

The trolls also took to Twitter, with a
man named Ricky from Dublin writing: ‘Dale  Cregan Wat A Hero 
#F**kThePolice’. Tony Snow from Nottingham also tweeted ‘Dale Cregan u 
legend’.

The abuse started on Tuesday when 
messages on Facebook referred to Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes as 
‘scumbags’. The creator of one of the pages wrote ‘So a pair of coppers 
got killed who gives a ****?’

The flurry of abusive messages is called ‘trolling’, where internet users aim vile abuse at certain targets, often celebrities.

The messages of praise bore a striking
resemblance to the mass outpouring of support that appeared online 
following the 2010 death of steroid-addicted killer Raoul Moat.

Nearly 
30,000 joined a tribute group entitled ‘RIP Raoul Moat You Legend!’

Last night, police said they were 
aware of the Facebook entries and tweets. Senior officers said they were
investigating them to ascertain whether any constituted a criminal 
offence.

A senior source said: ‘It does form part of our overall inquiry
into the case and, although it is not a priority at this stage, 
inquiries are continuing into the various Facebook entries, tweets and 
other insensitive remarks.’

A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We can 
confirm that tribute pages have been removed today because they violated
Facebook’s statements of rights and responsibilities.’

Last night Assistant Chief Constable 
Garry Shewan said: ‘Greater Manchester Police is investigating reports 
of an offensive Facebook page set up following the murders of PC Fiona 
Bone and PC Nicola Hughes.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
