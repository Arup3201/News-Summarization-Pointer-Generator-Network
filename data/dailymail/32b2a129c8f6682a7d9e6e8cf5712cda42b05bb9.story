One mother has learned that the kindness of strangers can be boundless after her seriously ill daughter lost her 'bravery bracelet'.

Madelyn McKinnon, from Brisbane, has undergone countless surgeries, procedures and treatments in her two short years, and to help her along the way her family bought her a silver bracelet from Pandora.

Each charm on the piece of jewellery represented an obstacle she had overcome, or a milestone she surpassed, and so held special meaning for the McKinnon family and Madelyn's mother Melissa.

'It’s basically Maddy's life on a bracelet, she’s been through a lot in her time,' Melissa McKinnon told Daily Mail Australia.

But on Wednesday just after Madelyn, who is two this week, had been admitted to the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane for more treatment, somewhere between the cafeteria and her room the bangle went missing.

When a head-to-toe search and retracing of footsteps turned up nothing, Ms McKinnon took to Facebook to ask for help recovering the symbolic bracelet.

'Yes, the bracelet is very pretty and is quite expensive for a 23-month-old but if only you knew what she had to endure for those charms,' the young girl's mother wrote.

'She has been on life support, had countless surgeries, MRI's, Lumbar punctures, EEG's, blood tests, infusions, transfusions to just name a few. Our daughter is a very sick child and has been since she was 5 weeks old and her Pandora bracelet is to recognise her bravery.'

Ms McKinnon also said she had checked with hospital security, volunteers and staff and reported the matter to the police but had not managed to recover the bangle.

She said the overwhelming feeling when she first realised the bracelet was missing was 'grief'. 

This replacement bracelet was gifted to Maddy just days ago, and now holds even more meaning for the McKinnon family

Strangers and friends raised over $1100 for young Madelyn in just hours

'It was very emotional for us and we were just absolutely gutted … it's something that means so much and has sentimental value behind it,' Ms McKinnon said.

Madelyn has been very ill since she was just weeks old, when she suffered a series of life-threatening infections which left her with brain damage.

At the end of August, she was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, which means Ms McKinnon and her partner Marcus are at the hospital monthly, while caring for the six other children in their blended family.

Friends and strangers alike were touched by Maddy's story and soon Ms McKinnon was flooded with messages and donations from people wanting to help, through a Facebook page called Brisbane Lost And Found.

'I put a post on that (page) and literally within minutes we had people commenting on there wanting to replace a charm.

'The response we had was just so overwhelming and I was left just speechless,' Ms McKinnon revealed.

Maddy's ongoing treatment is very expensive and she has six other siblings in her 'blended' family

People offered to replace the charms or bracelet for Madelyn, and soon more than $1000 had been raised.

But Ms McKinnon was shocked again when the Pandora store visited by a kind stranger intending to replace the bangle with donations offered to give Madelyn a brand new piece of jewellery and all the charms she lost free of charge.

'There was one lady by the name of Natalie and she ended up coordinating the whole thing for us,' Ms McKinnon said, describing the stranger as a 'beautiful lady'.

Before Natalie went to Pandora Mt Ommaney to pick out the new bracelet, another woman in the group had emailed the company's head office directly, explaining Maddy's situation.

The store then offered to donate a replacement bracelet, as did two other stores in the area.

'Everybody just pulled in, and then we ended up having three Pandora stores wanting to donate,' Ms McKinnon said.

'It just restores your faith in humanity,' Ms McKinnon said

'We never expected it to end up like this... To have this response makes you so proud to be Australian.

'It just restores your faith in humanity,' she added.

The ongoing cost of Madelyn's ongoing treatment is very expensive, and now the McKinnon's have a little extra to help them out after so much was raised for the bracelet.

'The money that was originally raised to go towards charms.. is now being raised to pay for the remaining amount for her wheelchair,' Ms McKinnon said.

'To have the response that we did was just so heartwarming and so generous and kind

'These are complete strangers, now we feel like she’s sharing her journey,' Ms McKinnon said.

'Now that bracelet has an entire new meaning… she now got a bracelet that shows Australia is with her.'
