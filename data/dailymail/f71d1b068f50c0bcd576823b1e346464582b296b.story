Detectives from Flemington Local Area Command have been investigating the body after it was found in the boot of a car at Lidcombe, Western Sydney almost two weeks ago.

The green Honda Accord containing the remains had been abandoned near Rookwood Cemetery where it sat for two weeks before police made the gruesome discovery. 

Local residents who reported the car said the vehicle was damaged and had aluminium foil over its number plates.

Police uncovered an overwhelming smell when they opened the car.

While the body was badly decomposed, police eventually identified the body of Ting Huang.

It was formally denied by Magistrate Carolyn Barkell.
