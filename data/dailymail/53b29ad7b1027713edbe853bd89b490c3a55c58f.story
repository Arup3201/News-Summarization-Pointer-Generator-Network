A classmate of the grandson of billionaire T. Boone Pickens has been arrested for allegedly removing evidence from the apartment where Thomas 'Ty' Boone Pickens IV died.

Police say Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, 21, removed heroin, drug paraphernalia, syringes and marijuana from his apartment, where Pickens died from an alleged drug overdose on January 29.

Rodriguez, a student at Texas Christian University where Pickens had attended, was arrested last Wednesday in Fort Worth, Texas. He was released immediately after posting $5,000 bail.

Charged: Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, pictured, has been charged with taking evidence from an apartment and hiding it from police investigating the death of Thomas 'Ty' Boone Pickens IV

Unspeakable tragedy: Pickens, 21, was a junior at Texas Christian University and died after a suspected 'heroin and Xanax' overdose. He had probably been dead for hours when a friend finally drove him to the hospital

A student found the grandson of the wealthy oil and gas titan at Rodriguez's off-campus apartment on the morning of January 29. The unidentified student who found Pickens said that the victim wouldn't wake up and that he had probably been dead for several hours.

Sources told the local news they believed that the 21-year-old had overdosed after witnesses told police that Pickens injected heroin and took the prescription pill Xanax the day before his death.

The Tarrant County medical examiner has still not officially ruled on the cause and manner of death.

Now police say Rodriguez removed evidence of the suspected drug use from Pickens' apartment and hid it from police.

The TCU student was charged on March 8 with tampering with evidence with intent to impair an investigation.

It is a third-degree felony and if convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $10,000.

Tycoon: Oil executive Pickens is worth over a billion dollars after starting his career in 1956. He has also been active in national politics

Though TCU did confirm Rodriguez was a student at the private university in Fort Worth, they declined to comment on the recent charges.

'It is difficult to hear about this development, as the TCU community is still mourning Ty's death,' the school said in a statement on Monday.

'Because this is a police investigation, all we can do is verify that he is a TCU student. As in all such cases, he has been suspended from the university pending a hearing through the university's disciplinary process.'

Pickens was a junior at Texas Christian University where he was majoring in strategic communications.

'Ty’s loss at such a young age is an unspeakable family tragedy for the entire Pickens family and his many friends,' the family said in a statement.

'We mourn his passing and respectfully request that the family be allowed to grieve in private in this time of sorrow.'

His grandfather is worth more than $1.2 billion and spent a lifetime in the oil industry.

Ty's father, Thomas Boon Pickens III, is the industrialist's youngest son.

T. Boone Pickens, 84, got his career started in 1956 when he founded Mesa Petroleum.

He later gained a reputation in the 1980s as a corporate raider with planned takeovers of numerous other companies.

Campus: Pickens was a student at Texas Christian University. The school confirmed that Rodriquez is also a TCU student

Pickens has also been actively involved in national politics.

He
was one of the leading opponents against Democrat Sen. John Kerry's bid
to unseat President George W. Bush from the White House in 2004.

And now, after a career in the oil industry, he has championed a plan to 
get America to use fewer fossil fuels by promoting alternative energy 
such as wind, solar and natural gas.

He plans to build the world's largest wind farm in Texas to champion his idea.

Pickens, who has five children and 12 grandchildren, lives in an opulent mansion in the 
exclusive suburb of Preston Hollow, Dallas where neighbors include 
former president George W. Bush, many of the Dallas Cowboys and George 
Michael.
