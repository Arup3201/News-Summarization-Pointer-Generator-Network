At first glance, it looks uncannily like the flying golden snitch that Harry Potter chased while playing quidditch - but in fact these amazing images show a unique colour-changing beetle.

The incredibly rare golden beetle was captured by photographer Chime Tsetan.

The Golden Tortoise Beetle, as it's formally known, can change colour and can even alter its reflectivity.

The beetle is strikingly similar to the golden snitch seen here in the hand of Daniel Radcliffe playing Harry Potter. In the film series, the flying ball was used in the game of quidditch

The tiny insects are able to change colour, from golden to a red with black spots rather like a ladybug.

They can alter the reflectivity of the cuticle so the outer layers become clear, revealing a ladybug type of red coloring with black spots.

This colour change is accomplished by microscopic valves controlling the moisture levels under the shell.

Chime, who is based in Tibet, captured the stunning insect while visiting an irrigation channel in Mundgod, India.

He said: 'As kids back in the school days, we used to call it 'Ser Bu' which means golden insect.

'We used to catch the insects and put them in our geometry boxes with the leaves on.

'These beetles come in various colours, golden like this one and also in silver, yellow and spotted.

'A big golden beetle like this used to fetch us two to three pencils or a pen in exchange with other kids who used to be amused with this shiny creature.

'So when I found this beetle last year, it brought me all my childhood memories.

Chime took up photography as a hobby while he studied at university after his family moved to India in 1960 when Tibet was invaded by China.

Golden tortoise beetles are common beetles that can be found on morning glory leaves, which are their preferred food.

They can change colour, looking initially like tiny jewels, or golden ladybugs, by altering the level of reflectivity so the outer layers become clear.

Tsetan said: 'It doesn't sting or bite. It just tries to get to an elevated place to fly, in this case, my finger tip.

'But it did poo on my finger just before it flew away.

'Nowadays we don't find much of them around any more.'
