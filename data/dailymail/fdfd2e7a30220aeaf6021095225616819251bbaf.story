British armed forces could become deeper embroiled in the battle against the Islamic State after it was revealed last night that Apache helicopters could be deployed to Iraq.

Until now, only the Royal Air Force has been involved in air strikes against the terror group.

If Apaches are sent to Iraq - which are piloted by the Army Air Corps - it would mark the first British Army involvement in a conflict role in the country.

A source told The Times last night that Apache attack helicopters may become necessary because jihadis are able to move around the battlefield quickly thanks to social media and messaging application WhatsApp.

Warplanes flying at 20,000-30,000ft are therefore having to react to moving targets.

A Government source told the newspaper: ‘What we are seeing is ten-man, two-vehicle teams being tasked through messages on WhatsApp or Facebook.

‘Once they’ve got their objective, they decide themselves how to meet it, what equipment and arms they need, so there’s almost no command or control to hit from 20,000ft.’

The source said that, in order to respond to the changing tactics, UK troops needed ‘something that can act very quickly on intelligence’.

Britain had a fleet of eight Apaches in Afghanistan, where Prince Harry was among the co-pilots during 2012.

A second Whitehall source told The Times that the idea of sending Apaches to Iraq had been suggested to Permanent Joint Headquarters, the UK’s hub for all military operations.

Sending the helicopters could be seen by some critics as a step closer to putting troops on the ground. If Apaches were deployed, a base would also have to be set up for the helicopters closer to the area of engagement.

Describing the Apache’s strengths, Colonel Mike Smith, the Army Air Corps officer in charge of aircrafts at a US base in Kandahar told The Times: ‘What we have demonstrated [in Afghanistan] is if you take the Apache specifically, if you need to engage, it is a hugely capable attack platform.’

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night that Britain had no current plans to send Apache helicopters to Iraq.

‘We constantly review our options and will carry on scoping what other training and support we can offer in conjunction with the coalition,’ he said.
