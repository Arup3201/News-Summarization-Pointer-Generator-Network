From battling commitment phobes to making time for long distance lovers, finding love in the digital age isn't always the easiest of tasks.

But that could all be about to change if Danielle Waller, 30, gets her way. Dubbed 'the UK's number one matchmaker', the Australian has brought more than 40,000 couples together.

So what's the secret of finding a long term love? According to Waller, it's all about trying new things and being open to romance - even when it comes in the most unlikely form.

'I think the biggest mistake is sitting back and expecting love to stroll on over and high-five you,' insists Waller, who also works as a dating guru for Speeddater.com.

'It’s a very romantic idea to trust in fate but it’s a mistake not to be proactive with your love life.'

Instead, she says, it's better to work on getting out and about and finding new ways to meet people, whether that's in a bar, a class or even online.

Not that she's ready to recommend Tinder. 'Everyone seems to be on Tinder to find love in their pants,' she laughs. 'I think the chances of finding love on there are pretty low.'

While Tinder might be out, everywhere else is, in Waller's world, a happy hunting ground. 'There is so many places to meet people,' she enthuses.

'On the tube, at a gig, at a housewarming party, singles event and even 
online. Mix it up – if you approach dating in the same way you always 
have you will get the same results, which is often no results.

'Always be
 open to the possibility of meeting new people as you never know where 
it could lead.'

So how do you know when you're onto a winner? While Waller says looks undoubtedly do play a part, making sure you're both 'on the same page' is key to making things work.

'All sorts of things factor in here but 
it mainly comes down to chemistry and compatibility,' she explains.

'Chemistry is 
unexplainable but compatibility is very much based on whether you are on
 the same page or not.

'Sharing the same values, interests and objectives
 in life means you'll still be compatible in the long term.'

She also suggests not setting too much store by 'lists of qualities' and instead being open to people who tick most - as opposed to all - of your boxes.

'I think being a little picky can be a 
positive as no one should "settle" for someone but I would say that dating with a checklist eliminates all the fun.

Shared interests: Mutual passions, whether dogs or books, boost the chances of long term love

'It’s perfectly fine to insist on being with someone who is loyal, caring
 and so on but it’s important not to sweat over the small stuff.'

If you do decide to take the plunge and go online, Waller suggests using photos to share a glimpse of your interests, on the grounds that very few suitors will have the time to trawl through dull lists of personal qualities.

'The most important aspect to a dating 
profile is your profile picture,' she explains. 'I would add extra images which say something about you and your 
personality - they make a great conversation starter.

'So, if you spend 
every bank holiday in a different city or are crazy about rock climbing 
you should show this off. The aim is to attract people with similar 
interests who you could potentially hit it off with.'

Your biography should be kept short, sweet and snappy and ideally avoid tired cliches (think 'live, love, life') while conveying a sense of who you are.

'Don’t fall into the trap of being generic,' adds Waller. 'Listing a 
bunch of qualities can seem empty so try showing these qualities instead.

'Don’t say you are fun with a good sense of humour and then write a dull 
profile - you have to sell yourself.'

Waller herself is happily coupled up but says when she was single, similar tips came in handy and ultimately helped her find her own boyfriend.

'I spent a few years happily single as I 
was content in my life and then I 
went on a dating spree,' she chuckles.

'I did everything, including online dating and downloading 
apps, and attended singles events. I met some great guys, went on lots of dates and also committed to a few 
relationships.

'Several months after my man-mission started, I went 
snowboarding and ended up meeting the love of my life.'

And with a little help from Waller, so could you.

She's brought more than 40,000 couples together but while Danielle Waller says there are no hard and fast rules, there are ways to boost your chances of finding long term love.

From ditching your emotional baggage to getting out and about, here are her top five tips for finding long lasting love.

LEAVE YOUR BAGGAGE BEHIND

Always feel ready to date. Not because you are lonely, but because you are ready to make your life even more awesome.

STOP DATING YOUR SOFA

Be
 proactive, try out different classes; go to singles events and online 
date until you get RSI from typing.  If you are serious about making 
love happen you need to try every avenue and make the most of each 
opportunity. 

BE OPEN-MINDED

Give people a chance, not everyone experiences love at first sight. 

DON'T STICK TO YOUR 'TYPE'

Knowing
 what you do and don’t want is a great thing but why not mix things up. 
You might just surprise yourself, because if your ‘type’ hasn’t worked 
out so far, then maybe you need to be realistic about what your ‘type’ 
should be.

BE POSITIVE

Smile. Laugh at the bad dates. Write a blog about it.
