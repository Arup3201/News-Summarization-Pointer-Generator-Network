A seven-year-old schoolgirl who suffered horrific injuries after a quad bike crash has astounded her family by making a  complete recovery.

Abigail Cavell was driving a Suzuki quad bike last Wednesday on wasteland in Scraith Wood, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, and hit a concrete post, suffering a skull fracture which impacted on her brain.

Her mother Katy Cavell has spoken today of her relief after Abigail was released from Sheffield Children's Hospital and was able to return home.

A girl was left in a life-threatening condition following a crash in this wood in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, last Wednesday

'Abigail was discharged from hospital earlier today, and has made a 100% recovery. We're so glad to have her home,' Katy said.

'She was out playing with a lot of 
friends on a sunny night at about 6.45 in the evening, and there were 
two adults present to make sure the kids were safe.

'One of them was the owner of the quad bike. The area around us is very quiet, and we know Abigail is safe playing on the land.

'In hindsight, she shouldn't have gone on her friend's quad bike and she knows that.

'She suffered a serious injury, but didn't need any CPR. We're just happy she is home and well.'

The youngster, described by neighbours as a 'dainty' and 'delicate' girl, was playing with other young children on the empty wasteland on the back of a housing estate when the accident happened.

The crash site is at the back of a row of houses, around five to six doors away from her home.

There is no minimum age for those who ride quad bikes on private land, provided they have the permission of the landowner.

On public roads, however, it is illegal for anyone under 16 to ride the machines.

Drivers, furthermore, must comply with regulations common to road-going
vehicles, ensuring they have a licence, and that the machine is 
registered, taxed, and has an MOT, number plate and lights.

Guidelines issued on the Department for Transport website state: 'You don’t need a driving licence to ride a quad bike off-road.

The accident happened in Scraith Wood, the Southey Green area of north Sheffield

'You don’t have to tax and register your quad bike if you’re only going to use it off-road.'

The Health and Safety Executive says that on average, two people die each year in quad bike 
accidents. There are also estimated to be more than 1,000 serious 
injuries annually.

Brake, the road safety 
charity, is campaigning for the introduction of legislation which would 
restrict quad bike use to older children on certified tracks.
