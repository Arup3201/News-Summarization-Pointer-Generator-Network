If you don't have your heart in your mouth after watching this then you probably are a fighter pilot. 

This astonishing video shows an Airbus A320 HB-JLT soaring over pristine white snow-covered mountains in Switzerland with six F-5E Tigers of the Swiss air force aerobatic team the Patrouille Suisse - the country's equivalent to the RAF's Red Arrows.

The Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) passenger jet and its escort were performing a flypast over the Wengen resort in Bernese Oberland in celebration of the Lauberhorn International Ski Races last month.

Swiss International Air Lines A320 HB-JLT took with it an escort of six F-5E Tigers of the Swiss air force aerobatic team the Patrouille Suisse

Eat my dust: The vapour trails of the jets can be seen scudding across the perfectly blue sky above the pristine whiteness of the Bernese alps

From all angles: the incredible shots of the jets taking a turn around the mountain are taken from 20 cameras both in the air and on the ground

Something to behold: Winter sports fans were treated to the amazing acrobatic flypast by Switzerland's equivalent of the Red Arrows

Too close for comfort: One of the Patrouille Swiss jets looks like it is hanging off the edge of the Airbus' wing in this stomach-churning shot

In the two minute video incredible shots of the jets taking a turn around the mountain, taken from 20 cameras both in the air and on the ground, are spliced with footage of a skier speeding down the famous downhill course. 

The course is the longest in the world at 2.78 miles, resulting in run times of two and a half minutes - about 30-45 seconds longer than standard downhill races, with top speeds approaching 100 mph for the top racers.

The Lauberhorn downhill run is surrounded by the Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau mountains above the Lauterbrunnen valley.

In the video the skill of all the pilots involved is there for all to see as they cruise in effortless harmony above the bright white peaks to an exhilarating soundtrack.

Observers from below can only look on in wonder as the aircraft bank at seemingly impossible angles, with the fighter pilots even turning their F-5E's upside down at one point. 

Just as the skier never strays off piste they are always in control, though the pilots of the Airbus are shown having the occasional peek outside the cockpit to check exactly where their cohorts are. 

The HD-quality film was compiled from more than 60 hours of footage, and features a soundtrack specially composed for the occasion.

It offers a glimpse behind the scenes of the whole exercise including cockpit views of the nine pilots involved which provide previously unseen perspectives of the air show.

The film was produced to celebrate the fourth consecutive year of SWISS' partnership with the Lauberhorn International Ski Races in what was their 85th edition.

SWISS is Switzerland’s national airline, serving 104 destinations in 48 countries from Zurich, Geneva and Basel and carrying some 16 million passengers a year with its 91-aircraft fleet. 

It has 8,250 staff, is part of the Lufthansa Group and is also a member of Star Alliance, the world’s biggest airline network.

Superlative skills: The ability of all the pilots involved is there for all to see as they cruise in effortless harmony above the bright white peaks

Impossible: It is hard to believe the planes don't touch as the seven aircraft bank together at angles that appear unbelievable from below

Speed demon: The Lauberhorn downhill run is the longest in the world at 2.78 miles, resulting in run times of two and a half minutes - about 30-45 seconds longer than standard downhill races, with top speeds approaching 100 mph for the top racers

Now you're just showing off: The Patrouille Swiss pilots flip their aircraft upside down at one point during the dizzying aerial footage

In the driving seat: One of the 20 cameras capturing the film focuses on a Swiss air force pilot, seen here with two colleagues flying either side

Highway to the danger zone: The planes bank at terrifying velocity in the HD-quality film, compiled from more than 60 hours of footage

Rather you than me: The pilots must have needed a strong stomach to cope with some of the manouevs
