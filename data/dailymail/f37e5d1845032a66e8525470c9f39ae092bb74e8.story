A World War II veteran has been reunited with a tear-jerking love letter he sent to his late wife before they married 70 years ago.

Bill Moore, 90, of Aurora, Colorado, wrote the heartfelt note to Bernadean Gibson while he was serving in Europe. He fondly described her as 'lovable' and 'alluring' and himself as the 'luckiest guy alive.'

Over the years the letter - dated December 29, 1944 - went astray but a woman discovered it inside a record sleeve purchased from a thrift shop  and set out  to get it back to its rightful owner.

An emotional Moore was filmed by ABC News as he read aloud the handwritten message he penned when he was 20 years old.

Emotional moment: A World War II veteran has been reunited with a tear-jerking love letter he sent to his late wife before they married 70 years ago

Flashback: Bill Moore from Aurora, Colorado, wrote the heartfelt note to Bernadean Gibson while he was serving in Europe. He fondly described her as 'lovable' and 'alluring' and himself as the 'luckiest guy alive.'

Original manuscript: Moore was filmed by ABC News as he read back the handwritten message he penned when he was 20 years old 

'My darling, lovable, alluring, Bernadean,' the letter begins. 

Moore then jokes he could have written a lot more adjectives to describe his sweetheart but 'ran out of space.'

The script continues: 'You are so lovely, darling, that I often wonder how it is possible that you are mine.

'I'm really the luckiest guy in the world, you know. And you are the reason, Bernadean. Even your name sounds lovely to me.

'It's just when I get so horribly, terribly lonely for you that I write letters like this. I have never been so homesick for anyone in my life as I am for you.'

Young Loves: Bill and Bernadean Moore were married for 63 years and when Bill fought in World War II he sent florid love notes to Bernadean who was a high-school student in Kansas

Longtime loves: Moore's wife passed away in April 2010

Moore said he knew he wanted Gibson of Fredonia, Kansas, to be his wife after being torn apart by the war.

He met her while she was still in high school.

When Moore returned to the U.S. he went on to marry Gibson and have three children. 

The couple remained together for 63 years before Gibson passed away in April 2010.

After her death, Moore moved to an assisted-care facility for veterans and sold many of his possessions.

It's thought that's how his love letter ended up in a thrift store. 

Beautiful words: 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in all my life as I am for you,' concludes the letter

Ilene Ortiz of Westminster found in in the sleeve of a record she bought and contacted ABC affiliate KMGH for help in finding the subjects.

Moore's daughter, Melinda Gale, 48, suspects her mother may have slipped the message into the record for safe keeping because it was special to her.

She described its discovery as a 'wonderful gift' that reminds her of the very special bond her parents had.

Moore says he misses his wife terribly and she is always on his mind.

Through tears, he concluded: 'It's difficult talking out loud about it to other people. 

'But I loved her, and she loved me. That's all I can tell you. It’s a heartache not being with her all the time.'
