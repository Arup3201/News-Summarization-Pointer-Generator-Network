A British couple is taking legal action over claims that their Turkish honeymoon was ruined by ‘horrendous’ gastric symptoms that led to their daughter being hospitalised.

Simon and Davina Nordemann were away with their six children and young grandson when five members of the family suffered diarrhoea, sickness, stomach cramps and nausea.

The family, from Mickleover, Derby, stayed at the four-star Bodrum Holiday Resort and Spa, where they claim to have witnessed other children vomiting around the pool area.

The Nordemanns' daughter, Kacey, was hospitalised for 24 hours after falling seriously ill

The Nordemanns said their 10-year-old daughter, Kacey, became so ill that she had to be taken to hospital to be treated for dehydration.

They said it was a ‘terrifying’ ordeal because Kacey was attached to an intravenous drip for 24 hours.

Simon, a 41-year-old engineer for Rolls Royce, said: ‘We decided we wanted to spend our honeymoon all together as a family and we were all really excited to have some quality time together in what we hoped would be luxurious surroundings.

'Devastated': Simon and Davina Nordemann (centre, back) say their honeymoon was ruined by illness

Thomas Cook says it continues to investigate the source of the illness 

‘But we soon realised that the restaurant wasn’t what we had expected and we heard lots of other guests talking about falling ill.

'We were horrified when we saw children being sick by the pool and in the restaurant area but what made it worse was that none of the hotel staff seemed in a hurry to clear it up.’

He said the family members who fell ill were largely confined to their hotel rooms, including Kacey, who was seen by the hotel’s doctor.

The couple chose to go on honeymoon with their children so they could spend quality time together

He added: ‘Davina rushed with her to a local hospital in Bodrum where she was kept in for 24 hours. 

'It was really scary for them being in a foreign country and having to go to hospital and not what you expect to happen.

‘The trip was completely ruined and we’re devastated as it wasn’t just any holiday – it was our honeymoon.

‘What was meant to be a dream holiday turned into a total nightmare and now we will always have memories of our honeymoon for all the wrong reasons.’

In addition to Simon and Kacey, daughter Amelia, 12, son Kyle, 21, and three-year-old grandson, Brayden, also fell ill. 

Davina, a 41-year-old nurse, son Harry, 15, daughter Hannah, eight, and Davina’s daughter, Rebecca, 23, from a previous relationship, were the only family members not to fall ill during their stay in Bodrum last summer.

The family claims to have witnessed flies and birds in the restaurant near the buffet, old food being topped with new food in the buffet stands, and half-used bottles of water being topped up with water from containers which other people had used.

The Nordemanns say ‘dozens’ of other guests were sick at the resort and vomit in public areas wasn’t cleaned up promptly.

The family booked with Thomas Cook and the five members who fell ill have hired solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to investigate their claims and the source of their illness.

Irwin Mitchell said it also represents holidaymakers who travelled to the resort in September 2012, although the case has not been resolved.

Jatinder Paul, a personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘This should have been the best time of their lives but sadly this couple’s honeymoon with their family was ruined due to Simon and four other family members falling ill and the family understandably want to know why this was the case.

‘Gastric illness is not only unpleasant but can result in serious consequences, especially for young children and the family were extremely worried when Kacey had to go to hospital.

‘We hope that Thomas Cook will work with us as we investigate the conditions at the Bodrum Holiday Resort and Spa.

‘Nothing can turn back the clock and make up for the fact that the couple’s honeymoon was ruined, but we hope to gain some answers for the family to help them move forward from their ordeal.’ 

Tourists flock to Bodrum for its beaches and ancient attractions, including the Halicarnassus castle

In a statement, a Thomas Cook spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: ‘Thomas Cook takes health and hygiene issues very seriously and maintaining the safety of our customers is our number one priority.

‘We confirm that the Nordemann family reported falling ill while on holiday in July 2014 at the Bodrum Holiday Resort and Spa.

‘We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, and Thomas Cook operates both a quality assurance programme and routinely undertakes independent third party audits to ensure that the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.’

‘We are confident that those due to stay at the Bodrum Holiday Resort and Spa will experience the excellent levels of quality and standards they would expect from Thomas Cook.’

The tour operator said it continues to investigate the illness.
