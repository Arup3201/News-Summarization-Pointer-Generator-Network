Doctor Who supremo Steven Moffat has revealed there is no reason why a woman can’t play the world’s most famous Time Lord.

Moffat, 52, who is the show’s lead writer and head producer, said he had already put plot lines and references in previous shows to make it possible.

He said: ‘There is absolutely no reason why a woman can’t play  Doctor Who and I am the person who has made that possible.’

But Moffat insisted it was important to get the right person for the role and that it would be wrong to cast ‘a woman’ just as it would be to cast ‘a man’.

He said: ‘You cast an individual who you think is perfect for the part now and you don’t make rules for yourself before you start.

‘It is a question of who is the person who sets your brain on fire as the Doctor. Right now, without question – and everybody seems to have had the same reaction – that person is Peter Capaldi.’

Moffat’s comments coincided with last night’s 50th anniversary special, The Day Of The Doctor, which starred Matt Smith, David Tennant and John Hurt playing three different versions of the Doctor.

His support for a female Doctor does, however, put him at odds with Peter Davison, the fifth doctor, who earlier this month said it would be wrong to cast a woman in the role.

Capaldi, who is best known for the comedy The Thick Of It, has yet to make his first appearance but speculation continues that his eventual replacement will be a woman.

Last night bookmakers William Hill were offering odds of 8/1 that the role would go to a woman the next time it became vacant.

Several actresses have been linked to the part – including Billie Piper, who played the Doctor’s companion Rose Tyler, Broadchurch star Olivia Colman, Dame Helen Mirren and Oscar-winning Tilda Swinton.

Moffat, who spent a year planning the anniversary special which was broadcast in 94 countries, said the casting of Capaldi had been one of the show’s biggest-ever gambles.

He said: ‘He is an older man for a start and unlike some of the other actors who have taken on the role, he is already famous.’ Moffat added that last night’s special had sent the show in a new direction.

He said: ‘Every so often Doctor Who becomes a brand new show and it did that again last night. ‘People who saw last night’s  episode will now realise that the Doctor is on a very different journey – a different journey than the one he had. His mission statement has changed.’

Yesterday Tom Baker was one of the former Doctors who took part in a 50th anniversary convention at London’s ExCel Centre.

The new Doctor Who made a surprise appearance in the sci-fi favourite’s  50th anniversary television special  last night.

Peter Capaldi’s appearance lasted just a split second and a global audience of more than 100 million had to make do with a shot of just his eyes.

Capaldi, 55, joined his predecessors in the anniversary episode The Day Of The Doctor to see off a threat from the Doctor’s old enemy the Daleks.

But the BBC1 show also saw the return of some familiar faces. Tom Baker, the longest serving Doctor, appeared at the end of the episode, and former companion Billie Piper was also part of the action.

But the episode was dominated by a storyline featuring departing Doctor Who Matt Smith and two earlier incarnations, David Tennant and John Hurt.

Writer Steven Moffat packed the episode with one-liners, and some of the best jokes centred on the different personalities of the squabbling Time Lords.

The show ended with a spectacular line-up of all the previous Doctors.

You know you’re getting old when the Doctor Whos are getting younger.

You know you’re ancient when you remember your crush on the first Doctor Who, William Hartnell .  .  . And you know you’re closer to death (and possibly senile) when you watch the show and haven’t the slightest idea what is going on.

The 50-year anniversary special began  in spectacular fashion – the special effects and sound were as good as  those on  any major Hollywood movie.

The plot, however, left more to be desired. After receiving orders from one of those Redgrave women (the one who talks like .  .  . well, Elizabeth I, except,  in this case, she was just the messenger from Her Majesty), the current Doctor Who (Matt Smith) delivered some good gags, confused as to why the wrong queen was on the throne. Ms Redgrave threw up at some point and became a Zygon. 

Don’t ask me why.

Then we had John Hurt (the War Doctor) finding Billie Piper dressed in a sheet/shroud and possibly coming on to him. I was already hiding behind the sofa, but for different reasons from those that prompted me to do so 50 years ago!

The plot grew ever more complicated when Smith met the previous doctor, David Tennant, who had been wooing Elizabeth I on a horse – although from my PBS (Position Behind Sofa), it might have been Billy Connolly and Queen Victoria in Mrs Brown.

‘You’re my future selves?’ asked Hurt, when he met the pair in a forest, shortly after Matt and David had taken it in turns to wear a fez (although, again, from PBS, it might have been Tommy Cooper).

Dearie me. You wait for ever for a doctor to come along and then three come along together. As the threesome stood poised at the red button, ready to destroy the world, they opted to follow the path of courage – cue close-up of everyone’s Cyberman-style glowing teeth. Very scary.

The episode was full of great lines, some of them hilarious, but ultimately the episode was  a triumph of style over less impressive substance.

And, thankfully, there were Daleks. Nothing, however, will come close to the terror of those first tin men with laryngitis in black and white.

Except, perhaps, Jemma Redgrave’s vomit.
