Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has now scored in every minute of a football match.

Ibrahimovic became Sweden's all-time top goalscorer on Thursday with a brace against Estonia, bringing his international tally to 50 in 99 games and overtaking Sven Rydell's 82-year-old record.

The former Barcelona and Juventus forward has scored 369 goals throughout his 15-year career, but it was his strike in the 24th minute during the international break that completed the  statistic.

Ibrahimovic made his international debut in 2001 and scored his first goal in a 3-0 victory over Azerbaijan in a World Cup qualifying match.

In doing so, Ibrahimovic earned himself the 2013 FIFA Puskas Award for the best goal of the year.
