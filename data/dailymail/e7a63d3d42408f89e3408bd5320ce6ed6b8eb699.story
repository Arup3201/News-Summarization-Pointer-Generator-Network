Miles O'Brien, the PBS reporter who recently had his left arm amputated in emergency surgery, has spoken out about his 'mind boggling' injury and how he feels as though the limb is still there.

The science correspondent appeared on the Today show on Tuesday to share how he's adjusting to life just a month after losing his arm while abroad on assignment.

The 54-year-old was wrapping up reporting trips to Japan and the Philippines when he dropped a suitcase of television camera equipment on his arm.

'When I think of all the risky 
things I've done in my life - jumping out of airplanes, flying little 
airplanes, scuba diving - the fact that a heavy equipment case could 
take my arm is mind-boggling,' he said.

Staying positive: PBS reporter Miles O'Brien said he has been throwing himself into his work since his left arm was amputated last month following a minor accident

He initially ignored the pain, but two days later he asked for the details of a doctor from his hotel and went immediately.

The doctor admitted him into a local hospital for acute compartment syndrome, where internal pressure builds within a muscle compartment and stops blood flow.

He underwent surgery to relieve the pressure and was warned that he might have to have an amputation if the condition was particularly severe.

When he woke up, his arm was amputated above the elbow - but he could feel it.

Shock: O'Brien dropped luggage on his arm and when the pain became worse after 2 days he went to a doctor - who rushed him to surgery. When he woke up he discovered his arm had been amputated

'I
 felt my arm as if it was there,' he told Guthrie. 'I thought, "OK, I 
dodged that bullet! and then you look down, and it's like, "Uh oh, that 
did not go well." That was not a good moment for sure.'

Despite the life-changing procedure, O'Brien told no one.

'If
 I had told everybody and they flew in, I would have felt like I had to 
take care of them,' he said.

'I frankly just wanted some time on my own 
to sort this whole thing out, try to get my head together on it, much to
 the chagrin of my family and friends, that I didn't say anything.

'I 
think for me, it was the way to do it.'

Instead, he focused on work and completing a project for the anniversary of the earthquake in Japan, where he had been before the earthquake. He got himself to the airport and revealed his news when he returned home, as well as in a blog post on February 25.

Technology: He is using a mirror for his phantom limb pain. When he makes a movement with his missing arm, he copies the movement with his remaining arm in the mirror - and miraculously, the pain subsides

Treatment: He is pictured undergoing acupuncture treatment for the phantom limb pain

Now he is slowly coming to grips with every day tasks and recently celebrated opening a bottle of wine on his own.

But he is also exploring ways to alleviate his phantom limb pain with the help of a 'mirror box'.

'You're tricking yourself into believing your arm is there,' he said. 'You use a mirror and you look at it and you try to move your phantom limb, which I feel very much.

'Match that movement with the limb that's left, and your brain starts thinking, "Oh, the arm's there"â€™ and that alleviates some of that phantom pain. I don't think anybody really knows why.'

He now hopes to ride his bike, fly a plane and shoot video - all activities he did before the injury. Doctors have told him that prosthetics will make all of these possible.

'The technology has really gone in leaps and bounds, sadly because of the wars, but that technology is something I will take advantage of as time goes on,' he said. 'You have to decide what you need the device, the gadget, for.'

The 
former CNN science and space correspondent covers science for NewsHour 
and is a correspondent for public TV's documentary series Frontline and 
the National Science Foundation's Science Nation online magazine.

His concluding report on the Fukushima plant is scheduled to air on Tuesday's NewsHour.
