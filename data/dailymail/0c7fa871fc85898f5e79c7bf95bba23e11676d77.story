A proud resident of York has been awarded compensation from his bank after they wrongly claimed his home city was part of North Yorkshire.  

Peter Brown, a former sheriff of the historic city, received a letter from Lloyds Bank addressed to his house in 'York, North Yorkshire'.  

In his reply, he pointed out that the city has been legally independent from the country for nearly two decades.  

Compensation: Peter Brown has been given £75 by Lloyds Bank after they wrongly addressed a letter to him saying he lived in 'York, North Yorkshire'

The bank apologised for their error, and gave Mr Brown £75 to make up for the 'frustration and inconvenience' he suffered.  

Mr Brown, an accountant, served in the honorary post of sheriff between 1990 and 1991, and took an oath to preserve and protest the city.  

He informed Lloyds that York had been self-governing since the 14th century, apart from a brief interlude between 1974 and 1995.  

The only services the unitary authority now shares with the county are their police force and fire services, he added.  

Proud: York has been independent from its surrounding county nearly continuously since the 14th century

Carved out: The city was given the status of a unitary authority in 1995

York is geographically located in the county of North Yorkshire, but forms its own legally separate unitary authority.

The city has been formally independent from the county since 1386, when King Richard II granted it a distinct identity and appointed the city's sheriff.

It was incorporated into North Yorkshire for the first time in 1974, as part of Ted Heath's nationwide reforms to local government.

However, in 1995 the city was granted unitary authority status, giving it freedom from the county once again.

Lloyds customer services official David Fellows replied to his complaint saying he had verified his address with Royal Mail and accepted his assertion.  

'As you mentioned, North Yorkshire ought not to be included as one of the lines of your address,' he wrote.  

'Please accept our apologies for this mistake.  

'To put things right, I am offering to pay you £75 for any frustration and inconvenience caused.  

'I have today submitted a request to have your address corrected thoroughly and properly.'  

Mr Brown said he hoped the acknowledgement would spare other residents of the city from suffering the same misunderstanding as him.
