When boxer Glenn McCrory became a world cruiserweight champion in 1989, he could hear the raucous applause of the crowd – but the faces of his thousands of fans were just a blur.

Indeed, until three months ago  his vision was so poor that he likens his vision to being ‘like opaque  tights pulled over a camera lens’.

He admits cheating at eye tests to get his boxing licence – by memorising the letters on the chart.

But thanks to an operation in May using a new type of laser, Glenn now has near-perfect vision and says his life has changed immeasurably.

‘To be honest, at the World Championship it didn’t bother me too much,’ says Glenn, 49, who is now a Sky Sports pundit. ‘All I was looking at was the face of my opponent, Patrick Lumumba.

‘But I lived in the shadows for years. I could see clearly for just a couple of feet, then everything was blurred. By the time I had my operation I was convinced that I would never see the world clearly.’

Sight problems run in the McCrory family. Three close relatives, including one of his sisters, are blind, but Glenn’s condition was more straightforward. He simply suffered from myopia – short-sightedness.

The condition occurs when the eyes keep growing and become too long from front to back. This means that light doesn’t reach the retina but focuses too early, so distant objects become blurred.

Glenn’s problems started when he was 12 and at school in Stanley, Co Durham. ‘I was a tough kid and wanted to sit at the back of the class with the cool lads,’ he says. ‘The trouble is, I couldn’t see a thing on the blackboard.’

His main concern was that his condition might prevent him from following a career in the ring – boxers need to have good eyesight for their own safety. ‘I’d turn up for my regular eye test with a lovely chap called Dr Graham. He’d ask about my parents, and I’d ask about Mrs Graham.

‘In the meantime I’d memorise the 
third line from the bottom of the chart. As he talked I’d make sure I 
was standing near enough to see it, so I passed the test every time.’

So
 why didn’t Glenn, who also fought Lennox Lewis in 1991 for  the 
European heavyweight title,  not just wear glasses in secret? ‘If I’d 
been spotted it would have ruined my career,’ he replies.

According to a survey by insurance firm Simplyhealth, more than half of those aged between 40 and  75 have not had a recent eye test, even though 41 per cent have noticed a deterioration in their sight.

Glenn was spurred into action only when he started to suffer from long-sightedness too three years ago. ‘Now I couldn’t even read a restaurant menu,’ he says. ‘I was devastated.’

Finally, he underwent laser eye surgery, but to his disappointment, any improvement was short-lived.

However, at a Burns Night dinner this year, Glenn found himself sitting next to John Morgan, who works at Optical Express.

‘He was watching me squinting at the menu. We got chatting and he told me about lens-replacement surgery.’

Glenn underwent a ground-breaking procedure that uses a computer-guided ‘femtosecond’ laser to dissolve the lens with a remarkable level of precision, before it is replaced with an artificial one.

First, anaesthetic drops numb the eye before a cone-shaped suction ring is applied to the eyeball, says consultant ophthalmologist David Teenan, who operated on Glenn.

The laser is lowered and attached to the ring, and after a scan of the eye, two incisions are made – one is less than three millimetres, the other just one millimetre. The lens of the eye is broken up within the little bag where it sits. The patient is then given a local anaesthetic before the lens fragments are removed and a new intraocular lens is injected.

On the train home afterwards, Glenn telephoned John Morgan. ‘I told him the colours were so vibrant and everything was so sharp. I am so happy to be able to see again.’
