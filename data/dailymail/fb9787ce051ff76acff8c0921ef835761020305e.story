Two United Airlines flights were forced to make emergency landings this week in separate incidents in the US.

On Thursday night, pilots had to abort a flight and land at Indianapolis International Airport after they reported smoke in the cockpit.

Passengers were evacuated from the plane once it safely touched down, and they were taken to the terminal aboard buses.

The regional jet had 48 people on board and was flying from Columbus, Ohio to Chicago, Indianapolis television station FOX 59 reported.

The incident remains under investigation. 

In another incident, a United Airlines flight made an emergency landing Wednesday morning after a crack was discovered in the plane’s windscreen.

The Houston-bound flight – also originating in Columbus, Ohio – was diverted to Nashville International Airport, where it landed safely.

The plane’s 74 passengers were rebooked on a different flight, according to a report in Texas’ Longview News-Journal.
