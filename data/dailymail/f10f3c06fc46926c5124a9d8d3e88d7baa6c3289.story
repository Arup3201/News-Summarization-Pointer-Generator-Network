The wife of a gun instructor who was accidentally shot dead earlier this week while teaching a nine-year-old how to fire an Uzi has said her family are struggling to come to terms with the tragic accident.

Charles Vacca, 39, a father and retired army general, was teaching a young girl how to fire the gun at Bullets and Burgers range in White Hills, Arizona on Monday when she lost control of the gun.

His wife has now spoken to the New York Daily News as she and her family struggle with the tragic news.

Charles Vacca, 39, a father and retired army general, was teaching a young girl how to fire an Uzi at Bullets and Burgers range in White Hills, Arizona on Monday when he was shot dead

Scene: The tragedy unfolded at Bullets and Burgers, an activity center 25 miles south of Las Vegas

'It's really difficult', she told the paper. 'The kids are taking it hard.'

The
 owner of the Arizona shooting range where the incident took place yesterday defended letting the
 girl fire an automatic weapon.

Sam
 Scarmardo, owner of Arizona's Bullets and Burgers Adventure, said it 
was not unusual for other shooting ranges, and the girl seemed 
responsible.

'This was a 
very mature young lady and something she wanted to do and her parents 
were treating her,' Scarmardo told MSNBC. 'You know this was a big, 
something that was high on her bucket list to do.'

However, Scarmardo is thinking of now instituting a height minimum to perhaps prevent any future tragedy.

'What we're kind of kicking around right now is like at Disneyland, you know if you're not "this tall," you can't shoot.'

Arizona has no law establishing a minimum age to operate a gun.

County law enforcement officials in Arizona today said no criminal 
charges are pending following an investigation into the incident.

The Mohave County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that the shooting was 'being viewed as an industrial accident.'

A
 video clip released by the sheriff's office of the moments just before 
the shooting shows Vacca giving a girl 
in pink shorts and a braided ponytail hands-on instruction as she aims 
the Uzi at a black and white target shaped like the silhouette of a man.

Vacca
 is heard encouraging the girl and asking her to squeeze off one shot. 
Then he tells her, 'All right, full auto' and the weapon unleashes 
multiple rounds as the video cuts off.

It was apparently moments later that Vacca was shot in the head when the girl lost control of the submachine gun.
