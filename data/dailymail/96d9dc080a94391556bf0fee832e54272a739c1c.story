A couple has lost their bid for compensation from a travel agent after they said their holiday to Turkey was ruined by the call to prayer from a nearby mosque.

The man and woman, who have not been named, demanded half of the £1,900 they spent on the all-inclusive break, claiming they were disturbed by the sound of the Adhan repeated five times a day.

They alleged their holiday, to the Turkish town of Doganbey on the Aegean coast, was ruined by the 'noise', which summoned Muslim worshippers to prayers from a loudspeaker mounted on a nearby mosque from 6am.

The German couple filed the complaint against a travel agent in Hannover, saying they were not able to relax at the five-star Angora Beach Resort Hotel.

And they wanted the compensation to reflect there was an armrest missing from their chair on the flight to Turkey, and they had to endure a bumpy landing on the return journey.

However, the complaint was last week dismissed by Hannover district court, which found the travel agent, that has not been named, was not at fault.

The ruling added that the couple should have expected to be exposed to the sounds of the call to prayer due to the hotel being the centre of town – and said it was a local feature akin to the ringing of church bells in Germany.

‘The complainants should have taken this authentic sound into account while booking for the resort,’ the court said. 

‘The call to prayer is customary in Turkey and is comparable with church bells in a Christian country," the court said, according to newspaper The Local. 

‘This does not constitute a deficiency of service.’

The court also ruled that the bumpy 
landing was due to the weather, something that was beyond the control of
 the tourism company.

‘Since any landing is dependent on the weather conditions, over which the air carrier has no influence, flight passengers have to expect to deal with isolated cases of rough touch downs,’ the court added.
