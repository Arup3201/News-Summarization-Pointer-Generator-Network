Neymar has revealed he has no plans to move over to the Premier League any time soon.

The Barcelona and Brazil star is one of the hottest properties in world football and could have his pick of the planet’s top clubs if he decided to leave the Spanish giants.

Neymar is still only 23 yet that has not stopped him racing to 43 goals in 62 games for Brazil and he was the poster boy of the World Cup last summer.

Neymar, Brazil's captain and superstar, says he has no desire to move to England any time soon

But being in only his second year at Barcelona following a £48.6million move from Brazilian club side Santos in June 2013, he wants to stay there for far longer.

Neymar said: ‘As for playing in England myself, I’m very happy playing for Barcelona and I still have a long road to walk here.'

Neymar played at Barcelona with Alexis Sanchez before the Chilean moved over to Arsenal last summer.

‘Alexis is a big friend,’ he added, ‘and someone who I had the privilege of playing with at Barcelona. We used to get along very well on and off the field, so I’m very happy to see him so well at Arsenal.’

Neymar says he enjoyed playing with Sanchez but does not want to join him at Arsenal

The pair went head-to-head in Brazil’s 1-0 win against Chile at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday afternoon and Sanchez paid tribute to his former team-mate.

‘Neymar raised everyone’s spirits as he is a very joyful person,’ Sanchez said. ‘I hope he never changes. 

'His happiness is contagious and that’s something I really like. Regarding his quality, I cannot come up with something new. Everybody knows how good he is.

‘He dares to so some stuff with the ball no one would dare to that. That’s the beauty of football.’
