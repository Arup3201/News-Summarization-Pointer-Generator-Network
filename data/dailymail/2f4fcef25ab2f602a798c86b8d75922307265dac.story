An Austrian politician is in line to get up to £16,000 in compensation after a hidden camera used for snapping wildlife photographed him having sex in a forest.

The politician, who has not yet been named, will get the payout if a court rules the photographs violated his privacy.

Carefully concealed and placed well away from areas frequented by people the motion-sensing camera was designed to record forest wildlife in the Austrian region of Carinthia but instead caught the politician's exploits.

Legal experts said the camera contravenes Austrian laws restricting the use of surveillance cameras.

Privacy:  The politician could be in line for compensation of up to £16,000 after he was caught having sex on a hidden camera in Carinthia, Austria

Hans Zeger, president of Argen Daten, an NGO specialising in data protection, told the Daily Telegraph that official permission was needed to place the camera.

He added: 'At the very least it should have been marked with signs so visitors could adjust their behaviour and avoid the monitored areas.'

However, the Carinthia Hunting Society, the organisation which placed the camera, defended the use of the equipment.

'I cannot say for sure how many cameras are in operation in forests in Carinthia as they do not have to be registered to us,' said Freydis Burgstaller-Gredenegger, the society's manager.

'We have never had any problems with the cameras up until now.'

She added that the cameras were generally used to record animal feeding patterns.

So far the politician's blushes have been spared by the society decision to keep both the photographs and his name secret.
