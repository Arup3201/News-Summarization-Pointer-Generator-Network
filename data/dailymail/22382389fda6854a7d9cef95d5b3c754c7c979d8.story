'It's an important time for me. Obviously with those two going – Chicha (Javier Hernandez) on loan and Danny (Welbeck) getting a move to Arsenal – it's given me a great opportunity.

'It's going to be really important for me to get the minutes on the pitch.' 

It comes after Van Gaal made  Wilson change his shirt number because the United manager believes a striker should have a nine on his back.
