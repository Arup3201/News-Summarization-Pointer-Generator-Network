As Arctic weather hits America there's one critter who's lapping up the sun.

Munchkin the Shih Tzu is seen in a new video happily bounding along a boardwalk in  Southern California, where temperatures are currently around 22 degrees Celsius.

Wearing her comical teddy bear suit, the 8lb canine almost appears too hot at one point as she looks at the camera with her tongue hanging out.

Munchkin took to the spotlight last fall  when she debuted a rather unscary Halloween bear costume.

Her owner Cindy Roth crafted the fluffy ensemble out of a plush toy.

She then posted photographs and videos of Munchkin online, with many fans likening the animal to an 'adorable' version of the Star Wars Ewoks.

An 11-second film shows Munchkin bounding up to the camera completely unaware of how funny she looks.

To make the costume, Roth measured Munchkin up and selected an appropriately sized toy.

She also picked a teddy with matching sandy-colored fur. She then cut the face, feet and back out of the soft bear and removed all of the stuffing except for the arms.

To finish, Roth inserted Munchkin's front arms into the teddy's legs.

Munchkin appears to have a penchant for dressing up and another photo shows her modeling a party hat, complete with pink feather trim.

Her novel antics have secured her a burgeoning fan base, with her YouTube channel boasting more than eight million hits.
