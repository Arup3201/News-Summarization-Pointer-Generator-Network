A Silicon Valley real estate magnate has been accused of putting a spiked dog collar and leash on his pregnant wife before chaining her to the bed at gunpoint for two days and raping her with a golf putter.

Details of the alleged horrific incident emerged in court this week during 74-year-old Clyde Berg's preliminary hearing on charges of corporal injury of a spouse and sexual penetration by force.

His Swedish wife Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in the couple's San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband outfitted her with the leash and chained her to the bed while sexually assaulting her with the golf club.

Berg is not the father of her child.

Wife: Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in her San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband chained her to the bed

She took the stand yesterday at Santa Clara County Hall of Justice to present her version of events to a judge who must now decide if there is enough evidence to hold Berg over for trial.

The real estate magnate - who is worth $200 million - vehemently denies the charges and claims he's the victim of a scam to get around a restrictive prenuptial agreement.

He faces 15 years to life in prison.

During her testimony yesterday, Ellena shocked the court by refusing to answer to key questions - one about a night in 2010 when she was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and how her two previous pregnancies ended.

The San Jose Mercury News reported that when the 37-year-old said, 'I refuse to answer that', in response to one of the questions, the judge's eyes widened.  

The Swedish native has claimed in a 43-page civil suit that the incident capped off ten years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband.

The divorce papers state that Clyde Berg wielded his considerable power against her like 'a weapon of mass destruction' and claim she lived in virtual isolation 'as a slave' in fear of his unpredictable physical and sexual abuse.

She said he made her drink out of a dog's water bowl and dunked her head in the toilet after she vomited from morning sickness.

There have already been doubts raised about her account of what happened on the night of September 4 after gynecological reports that arguably show Ellena Berg did not sustain the degree of sexual abuse she claims and questions were raised as to how she was able to call 911 while her hands were cuffed behind her back.

Clyde Berg is the brother and business partner of billionaire Carl Berg, one of the richest people in the United States.

Ellena Berg has also obtained a restraining order against Clyde Berg and has custody of Rudy, the couple's beloved Weimaraner, whom she claimed was also abused by her estranged husband.

She is his third wife.
