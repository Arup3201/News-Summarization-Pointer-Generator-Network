There’s no doubting her formidable literary talent.

But on this occasion, Barbara Taylor Bradford has forsaken the finesse so often evident in her bestselling novels to deliver a rather blunt assessment of French President Francois Hollande, branding the Frenchman ‘a stupid man’.

The novelist attacked the 59-year-old premier over his affair with actress Julie Gayet, saying the sordid revelations about his turbulent love life wouldn’t even be fit for the pages of one of her popular page-turners.

The 80-year-old, who celebrated her 50th wedding anniversary with her husband Bob on Christmas Eve, also suggested that Mr Hollande’s son had introduced his father to Miss Gayet in a bid to seek revenge on journalist Valerie Trierweiler, who the president had left the mother of his children for. 

Mr Hollande has never married, but has four children Thomas, 29, Clémence, 28, Julien, 26 and Flora, 21, with fellow socialist politician Segolene Royal. Miss Trierweiler became his live-in girlfriend following his separation from Royal in 2007.

Mr Hollande then met Miss Gayet at a lunch organised by his son Thomas in 2012.

It was arranged after Thomas’ girlfriend Joyce Jonathan, a pop star who is close friends with the 41-year-old Miss Gayet, asked if the actress could come along to discuss the arts.

Miss Taylor Bradford was asked whether Mr Hollande’s behaviour could form the basis of one of her blockbuster novels.

She told The Lady Magazine: ‘I couldn’t possibly write about such a stupid man.

‘Here is a man who had four children with a woman and then after 30 years he dumps her for this journalist, Valérie Trierweiler, and in the meantime it turns out he’s been cheating on her for two years.

‘It was his son by Royal who introduced him to that actress Julie Gayet – did you know that? So the son was getting his revenge for his mother – that’s what I think as a novelist!’

There is no love lost between Miss Trierweiler and Mr Hollande’s four children, who they see as having broken up his relationship with their mother.

Miss Royal announced her split with Mr Hollande on the day she lost her presidential bid in 2007, but his relationship with Miss Trierweiler is said to have already been going on for around two years.

His children refused to speak to her for a year after she once sent a Twitter message expressing support for Olivier Falorni, a Socialist politician running against Miss Royal in parliamentary elections.

Asked if Britons had been intrigued by French women because they are ‘thinner and more chic,’ Miss Taylor Bradford the said: ‘Well, I do think they are thinner and “chicer”, actually. 

‘And I wonder what their secret is about being thinner. But I don’t like being too bitchy about French women – or any woman. I don’t want to say anything about the three that are caught up in this – the mother of his children, the mistress and mistress number two.

‘Will there be a mistress number three? Jimmy Goldsmith said it best: “When you marry your mistress, you create a vacancy.”’

Although Hollande has never married, she added: ‘Maybe they didn’t want to marry him, I don’t know, but if it had been me, I would have wanted to be married.’

Yorkshire-born Miss Taylor Bradford has sold over 88m books in more than 90 countries, with many of her works being made into movies or TV mini-series. 

Her debut novel, A Woman of Substance, published in in 1979, ranks among the top 10 bestselling fiction books of all time with over 32m copies sold.

The acclaimed author was awarded an O.B.E. for her services to literature in 2007.

She and her husband, a television producer, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on Christmas Eve last year.

The couple have never had children.

They have tried to start a family in the past, but the author has admitting having two miscarriages.
