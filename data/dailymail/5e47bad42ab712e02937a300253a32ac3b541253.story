The feud between the real-life Barbie and Ken has continued as Justin Jedlica publicly mocked his female cosmetically enhanced counterpart, Valeria Lukyanova, in these exclusive new photos.

After blasting the real-life Barbie for being 'a total fake', Jedlica transformed himself into a Valeria look-alike, comparing the Ukrainian beauty’s signature look to that of a drag queen.

The 32-year-old from New York said he mocked his doll rival to set the record straight that the real-life Barbie was anything but real.

'Valeria presents herself as a real-life Barbie doll, but she is nothing more than an illusion who dresses like a drag queen,' he said.

'Unlike me, who has spent nearly $150,000 permanently transforming myself into a human Ken doll, Valeria just plays dress up.'

He added: 'But as soon as you wipe away all that makeup she’s just a plain Jane and there's absolutely nothing special about her.'

Mr Jedlica, who has had 100 plastic surgeries, said: 'Valeria has been my arch nemesis ever since we met each other earlier this year, and by dressing up like her twin I wanted to prove that anyone can look like Barbie, even Ken!'

Enhanced: Jedlica first went under the surgeon's knife when he was 18

'And in all honesty, I think I make an even prettier Barbie than she does!'

Since first going under the surgeon's knife when he was 18, Mr Jedlica has had five rhinoplasties, a cranial brow bone shape and augmentations to his cheeks, lips, buttocks and chin.

By contract, Miss Lukyanova has said she only had breast implants, and works out at the gym to keep her shape.

The pair met during a TV appearance in February, but failed to hit it off.

Mr Jedlica said at the time that he did find Miss Lukyanova beautiful but added: 'It appears to me that much of her look is added makeup, fake hair and "slimming" corsets.'

'Drag queens have put on the same illusions with makeup and costumes for years,' he told the Huffington Post.

Miss Lukyanova, who teaches people how to have out of body experiences, responded by telling The Sun: 'He would do better not to comment on who is plastic and who is not. I think he is handsome man - but he overdid his lips.'
