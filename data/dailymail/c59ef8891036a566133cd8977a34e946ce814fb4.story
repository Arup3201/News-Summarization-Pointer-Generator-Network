Stereotype: Dickens was inspired to create notoriously tightfisted Scrooge, played by Albert Finney above, after seeing a grave marker in Edinburgh

It is a cruel stereotype: that Scotsmen have a tendency towards thrift that sometimes borders on the downright tightfisted.

And, according to a survey released today, it is entirely unfair. Quite the reverse, in fact - it shows that Scots are in fact the most charitable people in the UK.

More than 42 per cent of those in Scotland give money after watching a TV charity appeal - well above the national average of 25 per cent.

Those north of the border are more likely to donate to sponsorship requests from friends and family, with 65 per cent giving compared to the national average of 54 per cent.

Scots are also more responsive to charity emails - with 18 per cent saying they prompt a donation, versus a national average of just 12 per cent.

The results were found by online charity donation service Give as you Live in a survey of 2,000 people.

The survey also found that across the UK, young people are more likely to give to a charity than the old.

An impressive 85 per cent of those aged between 16 and 24 said workplaces and businesses should do more to support charity, with younger people embracing fundraising 
opportunities their companies offer.

54 per cent of workers aged 16-24 have taken part in work fundraisers, with only
39 per cent of people aged 45-54 and 41 per cent of those aged 25-44 getting involved.

Furthermore, 89 per cent of young people aged 16-24 say they would be more likely to shop 
with a retailer who supports charities over one that 
doesn’t.

The least likely are the over 55s, with only 15 per cent of survey respondents saying a retailers corporate social 
responsibility initiatives would influence their purchasing behaviour.

The survey also revealed that men are more charitable than women.

Last Christmas, men donated £17.89 to charitable causes, while women only donated £15.52.

With 27.6 million men in the UK, versus 
28.5 million women, this means that men gave an estimated £65.4 million 
to charity MORE than women.

The results come just months after an 
Ipsos Mori poll found Scottish households with incomes of less than 
£150,000 gave away an average of £356 last year.

The poll showed that Londoners donated almost £100 less - £268 - despite earning 25 per cent more than the Scots.

Overall Scotland was the most generous nation in the UK on average, followed by Wales on £328 and England on £285.

Polly Gowers, chief executive and founder of Give as you Live, said the internet has changed the way people donate to charity.

She said: 'It’s fantastic to see that the changing world of technology and online are really flipping some tired old stereotypes on their head.

'It transpires that if you want to find a generous charity donor, you should head far up North to Scotland and search for a young bloke!'

Give as you Live is a service that donates a percentage of what online shoppers spend to a charity of their choice.

Rather than the individual, the retailer makes the donation.

The organisation says it has helped users raise over £3.8 million for UK charities.
