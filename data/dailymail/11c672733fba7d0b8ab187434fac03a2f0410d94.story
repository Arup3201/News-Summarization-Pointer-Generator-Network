For more than 100 years the dome of the Capitol building in Washington DC has stood as a proud marker for American democracy and success.

But now it is due to be covered over with scaffolding as the first repairs to it since 1960 begin to fix the 1,300 cracks in its cast iron shell.

And, unlike some of the politicians below, the builders above will have to work fast as the $60million construction project is scheduled for completion just before the next Presidential inauguration on January 20, 2016.

Scroll down for video

Under construction: Work is due to start on a $60million project to repair the dome of the US Capitol Building which now has around 1,300 cracks in its cast iron shell

Blame the birds: Roosting birds have created holes in the dome which has allowed water to leak in causing damage to a lot of the paintwork

Removed: During the work decorative sections of the dome including some of the floral displays will have to be taken away in order to be repaired elsewhere

Water damage: The Apotheosis of George Washington fresco in the centre, painted by Italian artist Constantino Brumidi, has also been damaged by rain

Stephen Ayers, the Architect of the Capitol, said: 'A dozen years ago there were 300 and some cracks, a few more years there were 500 cracks, then 900 cracks, and now 1,300. Now is the time to intervene and make sure it's preserved for generations to come.'

The hugely complicated project will involve removing several floral displays and pillars to be taken away for repair, while the 290ft high dome will be patched and made watertight.

Workmen will have to remove up to 13 layers of lead-based white paint in order to get to the 14.1million pound iron structure below which has been damaged by centuries of rain and roosting birds.

Paint job: Workmen will have to chip away up to 13 layers of lead-based paint before they are able to get at some of the damaged cast iron underneath

Crumbling: The cornerstone of the old building was laid in 1793 by George Washington himself during a day of celebrations in the American capital

Rusted: Work was finished in 1826 thanks to the work of five architects, but more building began in 1850 as congress expanded along with the nation

In fact birds are the reason the 
condition of the dome began being monitored again after water leaked 
through a hole made by a nesting bird and on to the rotunda floor during
 a storm.

Modern building techniques will 
hopefully ensure that the current restoration survives longer than the last effort, as Mr Ayres revealed that welding completed between 1959 and 1960 has already failed.

The cornerstone of the building was 
laid in 1793 by George Washington himself with great pomp and ceremony, 
and was then worked on by doctor and part-time architect William 
Thornton who placed a shallow dome between the North Senate wing and the 
South House wing.

Conflict: much of the early work on the Capitol Building was destroyed when British troops set fire to it in 1814

After hours: Work to repair the 14.1million pound dome will take place mainly at night so as not to disturb congress who will carry on working below

Faulty: Stephen Ayres, Architect of the Capitol, says that welding that took place during the last restoration has already failed and will need to be fixed

Construction
 then crawled along under the watchful eye of several different 
architects before much of their work was undone by British soldiers in 
1814 who set fire to both the Capitol building and the White House.

Fortunately
 a rain storm stopped the building from being completely destroyed and 
construction was eventually 'finished' in 1826.

While scaffolding 
will cover some of the outside of the dome during the repairs, the fresco Apotheosis Of George Washington will stay on display as a doughnut-shaped 
safety net will be set up around it.

As it was: While the early Capitol featured a dome, it was a shallow structure between the two wings and nowhere near as grand as the one that stands today

Expanding: Architect Thomas U. Walter was tasked with expanding the building in 1850 as the growth of the nation was reflected with a growth in congressmen and senators

Crowning glory: The cast iron dome was added during the construction which included an expansion of the grounds around the building

The
 whole site will be illuminated with bight lights as most of the work 
will be carried out at night so as not to disrupt the work of congress.

However building work continued to 
enlarge the Capitol from 1850 and it was architect Thomas U. Walter who 
designed the cast iron dome to sit between new enlarged chambers, with 
work finishing in 1868.

The massive fresco inside the dome was 
painted by Italian artist Constantino Brumidi and consists of a portrait
 of the nation’s first president rising to the heavens flanked by the 
allegorical figures of Liberty/Authority and Victory/Fame.

High point: At its tallest point the dome stands at 290ft with the whole of Washington DC visible below it including the George Washington monument

Historical: Construction work on the building started in 1793 but was halted in 1814 when British troops set fire to it along with the White House

Tight schedule: Work is due to finish just before the next Presidential inauguration which will take place on January 20 2016

Off limits: While the dome itself will be obscured from view during the work, the main fresco will remain visible thanks to doughnut shaped scffolding

Maintenance of the modern-day Capitol Building falls to the Architect of the Capitol who is appointed for a ten-year term by the President and approved by the senate.

The Architect is responsible for the maintenance of all all of the Congressional office buildings, the Library of Congress buildings, the United States Supreme Court building, the United States Botanic Garden, and the Robert A.Taft Memorial.

Work on the Capitol Building began in 1793 as the cornerstone was laid by George Washington as part of a day of celebrations.

A string of architects then took up the job of completing it, including Stephen Hallet, George Hadfield and James Hoban who completed the Senate wing in 1800.

Benjamin Henry Latrobe was hired in 1803 nd by 1811 he had renovated the Senate wing and completed the House wing.

However much of their work was wasted in 1814 when British troops set fire to the building, along with the White House, which were only saved by a rain storm.

Eventually building work was 'finished' in 1826 by Charles Bulfinch, but as the nation and the government expanded it became necessary, in 1850, to start extending the structure.

It was during this period of building, from 1850 to 1868 that Thomas U. Walter added the large cast iron dome that sits on top of the building today.

He also extended both the North and South wings, adding new legislative chambers and expanding the grounds.

In 1897 the Library of Congress moved out of the Capitol into its own building, making space for new committee rooms.

In the 20th century, separate buildings were constructed to provide offices and committee rooms for the House and Senate. The Supreme Court moved into its own building in 1935.

Today’s Capitol complex includes the Capitol, six major House and Senate buildings, three Library of Congress buildings, the Supreme Court Building, the U.S. Botanic Garden, and other facilities.

The latest new project was to add the visitor centre to accommodate some of the millions of people who come to see the Capitol Building every year, and it took from 2001 until 2008 for it to be completed.

The last restoration efforts happened between 1959 and 1960 and the latest work is expected to take to years, finishing just before the 2016 Presidential inauguration.

The building and its grounds are maintained by an architect who is appointed by the President and approved by the senate for a 10-year term.
