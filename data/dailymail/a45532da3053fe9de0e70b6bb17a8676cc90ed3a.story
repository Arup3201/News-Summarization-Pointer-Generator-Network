Promise: BBC director of television Danny Cohen has pledged to include more women on comedy panel shows

All-male comedy panel shows will be consigned to the history books, after BBC bosses told producers that female guests must now be involved with the programmes.

Danny Cohen, BBC director of television, this week promised a better gender mix on such shows as Have I Got News For You, Mock The Week and Never Mind the Buzzcocks, which typically comprise all-male panels.

The move is part of a drive by the BBC Trust to address gender imbalance on our television screens.

In December BBC director general Tony Hall was tasked with getting more women on air 'as a matter of urgency'.

Cohen has been looking for simple ways to achieve this and it is understood comedy panel shows were top of his list.

BBC entertainment controller Mark Linsey said: 'Comedy panel shows are always better for having a good mix of people and of course that must include women.

'I’m making it clear to production teams that there’s just no excuse for delivering all male guest lists.'

The changes have come about following the publication of a report last year, which was commissioned by the BBC for the Cultural Diversity Network.

BBC2’s QI and Mock the Week came under fire for 'rarely having women represented or only having "token women" on their programmes.'

Female comedians, including Victoria Wood, have in the past criticised BBC panel shows for being a 'male preserve'.

In 2011, Wood said of panel shows: 'I don’t 
like them. They are a male preserve. That’s all right, that’s how they 
are. It is more of a male characteristic to want to top somebody’s 
gags.’

Meanwhile, Lee Mack, who is a team captain on BBC1’s Would I Lie To You?, said men are better 
suited to being stand-up comedians as they are more competitive - and therefore dominate TV panel shows as a result.

Speaking on Desert Island Discs last September, Mack said: ‘When
 men sit around and talk, they are very competitive. One person will 
tell an anecdote and the next person will try to top that. When you get 
six women together, they share a lot more.

'They
 will be far more interested in what the other person has to say. The 
conservation is more interactive and less about individually showing 
off.’

The 45-year-old, who 
wrote and starred in the BBC1 sitcom Not Going Out, added: ‘The problem 
isn’t that there’s not enough women in panel games.

'The problem is 
there’s not enough women in comedy in general.’
