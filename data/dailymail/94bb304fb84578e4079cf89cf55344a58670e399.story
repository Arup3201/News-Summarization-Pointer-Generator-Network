World Cup winner Per Mertesacker has encouraged Arsenal's young defenders not to be intimidated by the experienced players in the Emirates dressing room.

With the likes of Mathieu Debuchy and Calum Chambers ruled out for their next Premier League match against Hull City, there is a chance for youngsters like Hector Bellerin to come through the ranks.

The 19-year-old was handed his debut in the 2-0 Champions League loss to Borussia Dortmund and Mertesacker has urged him to be brave when he plays for the first team.

Speaking to Arsenal Player, Mertesacker said:  'He's a good addition to our squad and he can take his chance with Mathieu injured and Calum suspended.

'He's got some great chances and he has to take them now because you never know what will happen in football.

'It's tough to establish yourself as a young player at Arsenal as a lot of the positions have two players in, so it's hard for the youngsters to impress in regular games.

'But we have to rely on our reserve players and it's good to get a good relationship with them and try to give them some help. The most vital part is good communication on the pitch - they have to talk to me if there's someone in my back.

'I have to encourage them to speak to me even though I'm 30 and have a lot of international caps. They have to be brave and be themselves. He needs to talk as well and that's what I demand from him. 

'He listens a lot and he's a good guy, which gives him a good chance to be a regular pro at Arsenal.'
