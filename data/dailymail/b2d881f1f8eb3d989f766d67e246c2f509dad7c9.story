A 7-ft memorial cross that was stolen from its California desert perch two years ago mysteriously turned up hundreds of miles away in the San Francisco Bay area.

A local sheriff's department was notified Monday that the large cross honoring war dead was tied to a fence post in Half Moon Bay, 400 miles northwest of where it was erected, with an attached note asking its finders to contact authorities.

'This cross is an important historical artifact,' the note read.

Cross found: The National Park Service late Monday confirmed that the cross found in San Mateo County is the same one that once stood over the Mojave Desert in Southern California before going missing two years ago.

Please return: 'The Cross is an important historical artifact,' an attached note read. 'I would be very grateful if you would be so kind as to notify the appropriate authorities of its presence here.'

The National Park Service confirmed that it was the same Mojave Memorial Cross that went missing in 2010.

The cross had been resting atop Sunrise Rock in a national preserve in the Mojave Desert since 1934. It was erected by the Veterans of Foreign Wars to honor those who served in World War I.

At the time of its disappearance, the cross had been encased in a wooden box as a result of a decade-long legal battle over its existence between the VFW and the American Civil Liberties Union.

The cross was cut from its metal base and
 stolen after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it did not violate the 
separation of church and state because the national preserve it stood on
 was being transferred to a veterans group.

Long trip: The cross honoring war dead was found tied to a fence post in the San Francisco Bay area, 400 miles northwest of the Mojave Desert where it was erected in 1934.

State veterans believe the cross may have been returned by someone with a guilty conscious impacted by the upcoming celebration of Veteranâ€™s Day, ABC reports.

The VFW says it had been planning to dedicate a replacement for the stolen cross this Sunday.

For now, the cross is in the custody of the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office. VFW leaders hope to receive custody of the cross and drive it to Southern California this weekend.

"We'll start reaching out, making some contacts, notifying our detective bureau will start making calls to Southern California and see if we can get this back to its rightful owner and get it back to its rightful spot," San Mateo County Sheriff's Sergeant John Gonzalez told ABC.

A replacement cross will be erected in the original spot on Sunrise Rock on Veteran's Day, The Washington Post reports.

Origins: The cross had been resting atop Sunrise Rock in the Mojave Desert since 1934.

Big lift: Local police move the heavy cross to safety.
