He insisted that although the contest was 'bruising' he thought he would make a better leader than brother David, and still does.

It came as he was grilled by young voters on BBC Three, who questioned him about trust, drugs and being weird.

Ed Miliband has been challenged on live TV over whether he regrets 'stabbing his brother in the back' to win the Labour leadership

David Miliband had been seen as a frontrunner for the Labour leadership after Gordon Brown lost the election in 2010.

The surprise decision by Ed, his less experienced younger brother, to stand against sent shock waves through Westminster and plunged their relationship into the deep freeze.

Ed proved victorious, narrowly securing the leadership with the support of the trade unions.

But his decision to stand against his brother has proved to be one of the most potent aspects of his leadership remembered by voters, almost five years on.

Taking part in BBC Three's Free Speech programme, audience member Alex Hancock asked to applause: 'Do you think the Labour party would be in a better position if your brother was leader?'

Mr Miliband replied: 'Look I thought I was the best person for the job when I ran for leader, and I think that now. Look, let me try to explain to you why I thought that.

'It was obviously really tough for me to be in a contest with my brother, tough for him as well. I thought we needed to move on from New Labour. Because I thought we'd been a good government but on issues like Iraq, inequality we got it wrong and we needed to move on.

'I thought I was the best party to move the Labour party on. And sure it was bruising and sure it was difficult but I thought that then and I think that now as well.'

He was asked if he thought the Labour party would be better off if his brother David had won the leadership election

Audience member Fay asked Mr Miliband what he would do if he found cannabis in his son's bedroom

Ed Miliband would not call the police if he found cannabis in his son's bedroom.

He was challenged by audience member Fay over whether he would support the decriminalisation of cannabis.

He rejected the idea, insisting: 'We know that there are harmful effects.

'I think the signal government sends is important. If the government sends a signal that cannabis use is somehow OK, and we know there’s harder forms of cannabis and softer forms of cannabis, I think it’s sending the wrong signal.'

Fay responded: 'In a few years’ time when your sons are teenagers and you find a bag of cannabis in your bedroom, will you be going to a doctor or will you be going to the police?'

But the Labour leader insisted: 'I’ll be going to neither. I’d be discouraging from using it, absolutely I would.

Challenged on the issue again, Mr Miliband replied: ‘I hope I’d stop it happening in the first place.’ 

But Miss Hancock hit back with the stinging question: 'So do you regret stabbing him in the back or not?'

While there was laughter from some in the audience, Mr Miliband appeared stony faced. That's not the way I'd describe it,' he said. 'That's not the way I'd describe it. Look we both stood in this contest and we both offered different things to the Labour party.

'It was a narrow victory for me, but I won the election, I won the contest. It was tough at the time and it's obviously healed since then.

'But you know I think the thing people are focussed on for the next 55 days is the choice between me and David Cameron, not me and David Miliband. That's obviously the contest at this election.'

During the programme Mr Miliband was also tackled about whether his policies add, the lack of women in politics, rent controls and drugs policies.

An audience member called John told the Labour leader: 'You are often portrayed as a bit strange, a bit weird.' 

'I hadn't heard that John,' Mr Miliband said.

'And you look like Wallace,' John added. 'I had heard that,' the Labour leader laughed.

Asked if any of that matters, Mr Miliband insisted it did not. 'If you want this to be a beauty contest or a photo opp contest, then I'm not going to win it.'

'I think there are other things that matter in a leader. I think ideas matter, to change the country, decency matters, and whtehr you hear the voices of people across the country.

'I think you need someone in Downing Street who stands up for what they believe in.'

Awkwardly for Mr Miliband, his comments about being against photo opportunities came after he was pistured posing with his wife Justine in his kitchen.

It has since emerged that it is the couple's second kitchen in their smart North London home. 

Mr Miliband was cheered when he promised to abolish the bedroom tax, telling the audience: 'It is mean, its unfair, two thirds of the people it hits are disabled people.'

He also warned that people were being 'totally ripped off' in the private rented sector, and promised three-year tenancies, with rents controlled so they 'can't just be jacked up by 10 per cent without warning', and letting agents will be banned from charging fees to tenants.

He admitted the last Labour government did not do enough on rented housing.

An audience member called John told the Labour leader: 'You are often portrayed as a bit strange, a bit weird.'

Mr Miliband also admitted that a lack of trust in politics remains an issue for all parties. 

'People know that politicians have broken their promises in the past. It's not just Nick Clegg.

'My mission and what I've tried to do is make sure everything i promise is funded, credible and deliverable.

'Judge me in government. I've made sure that the promises i make are the promises I'll keep.

'My manifesto will be my contract with you. You will have to judge me on how I keep those promises.

'Some people in my party say why don't you make bigger promises, and I say it's because I want to be the first politician to under-promise and over-deliver, instead of over-promise and under-deliver.'
