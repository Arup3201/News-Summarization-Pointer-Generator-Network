No time behind bars: Austin Clem will not go to prison despite being convicted of three counts of rape dating back to when his victim was only 14-years-old

An Alabama prosecutor wants a state appeals court to review a judge's sentence for a man who was convicted on three counts of rape but avoided any time in prison.

Limestone County District Attorney Brian Jones filed papers over the weekend asking the Court of Criminal Appeals to intervene in the case of Austin Smith Clem, 25, of Athens, a clerk said today.

Jones also asked a judge to delay the no-prison sentence and temporarily incarcerate Clem.

A petition filed with the appeals court argues the lenient sentence was illegal under state law because Clem was convicted of first-degree rape and two counts of second-degree rape.

Clem should have been sentenced to at least three years in prison under the type of sentence the judge ordered, the prosecutor argued.

A jury in September convicted Clem on three counts of rape in a series of sexual assaults on a neighbor and one-time family friend, Courtney Andrews.

The woman, now 20, testified that Clem sexually abused her at age 13 and then again when she was 14 and 18.

The defense argued there was no evidence of assault and characterized the victim as a 'scorned woman.'

Clem could have faced decades behind bars, but Limestone County Circuit Judge James Woodroof last week handed down a sentence that means Clem won't have to spend any time in prison.

Victim: Courtney Andrews has taken the unconventional step of publicly identifying herself and slamming her attacker's sentence

Woodroof sentenced Clem to spend two 
years with a community-based corrections program that will allow him to 
continue working and living at home, plus spend three years on 
supervised probation.

He 
was ordered to pay $1,631 in restitution, to stay away from the victim 
and her family, to register as a sex offender, and to complete 
counseling.

The victim has 
told reporters she is outraged by the sentence, which the judge did not 
explain in his order. The victims of sexual assault has not been 
identified.

Rita Pfaff, a friend of the victim, testified that the woman told her at age 16 about the sexual abuse at 13 and rapes at 14.

Pfaff
said she witnessed the victim telephone Clem's wife to tell her what 
had happened and that Clem's wife begged the victim not to tell police.

Mr Clem might have his sentencing appealed after a prosecutor wants it to be reviewed

Pfaff
said the victim went to Clem's apartment when she was 18 because she 
was lured there under false pretense - the chance of seeing his three 
daughters - and another assault occurred.

'He
gets released into the free world with a slap on the wrist,' Pfaff 
said. 'You don't do this three times and get to go home to three little 
girls with the chance of doing it again.'

Court
records show Jones asked Woodroof the order Clem to jail while the case
is under review, but the judge did not rule immediately.

‘My
family was very relieved to hear the three guilty verdicts,’ Courtney’s
father Richard Andrews told AL.com. ‘We were floored to hear the judge 
hand down such a light sentence.’

Explaining that she was ‘livid,’ Ms Andrews recalled to the site ‘I thought, 'How is this even possible?’
