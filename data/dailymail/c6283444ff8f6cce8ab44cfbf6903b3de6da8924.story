Tragedy: Miss Saldanha was found dead days after receiving a hoax phone call at London's King Edward VII hospital

Criminal charges could be brought following the death of a nurse who hanged herself after transferring a call that led to intimate calls about the Duchess of Cambridge being revealed.

Scotland Yard has submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service relating to the prank call made to the King Edward VII hospital in London where Kate Middleton was staying.

Jacintha Saldanha, 46, a night sister, was found dead in lodgings close to the hospital after she unwittingly answered a story from Australian DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian posing as the Queen and Prince Charles. 

A colleague then described Kate's condition in detail to the DJs who have faced a strong public backlash following the prank.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will now consider whether any potential offences may have been committed, Scotland Yard said.

The mother-of-two was found dead by a colleague and a security guard on December 7, three days before her involvement in the prank.

Miss Saldanha left two notes in her room and was found with marks on her wrist when her body was discovered, Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard as an inquest was opened and adjourned.

Greig and Christian spoke of their grief on Australian television soon after the nurse's death.

They said their prank had prompted 'a tragic turn of events no-one could have predicted or expected'.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Following the death of Jacintha Saldanha, officers have liaised with the CPS as to whether any criminal offences had been committed in relation to the hoax call made to King Edward VII Hospital in the early hours of Tuesday December 4.

'On Wednesday December 19, officers submitted a file to the CPS for them to consider whether any potential offences may have been committed by making the hoax call.

Miss Saldanha is thought to have left three notes in total, following her death, including one criticising the hospital.

In another, the mother of two detailed her anguish and shame about being duped by the two Australian DJs into passing on the call.

The third dealt with her requests for her funeral, which was held in her hometown of Shirva, south-west India earlier this week.

Prince William and his pregnant wife Kate said they were 'deeply saddened' by the tragedy. A Palace spokesman said the couple had not made a complaint about the prank call.

'Their thoughts and prayers are with Jacintha Saldanha’s family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time,' a statement said.

At a memorial service in Westminster Cathedral before her body was flown to India, Miss Saldanha's husband Benedict Barboza said his wife’s death had left him devastated.

The couple’s son Junal, 17, and adopted daughter Lisha, 14, also paid tribute before travelling with her body to Mangalore.

Following the service in central London, Mr Barboza, 49, an NHS accountant, said: ‘My wife, you were the light in my darkness, who always showed me the way forward. From the day we met, you always stood by me in times of hardship and happiness.

‘I feel a part of me has been ripped out,’ he added, fighting back tears. ‘Without your beautiful smile and sparkling personality, the house is an empty place to live.

‘Nineteen years of togetherness with a strong bond of affection and understanding will be cherished forever in my life. Your loss is a very painful one and nobody can take that place in my life ever again. I love you and miss you forever.’

Miss Saldanha's daughter Lisha, 14, said: ‘We will miss your laughter, the loving memories and the good times we had together. The house is an empty dwelling without your presence.

‘We are shattered and there's an unfillable void in our lives.

'We love you mum, sleep in peace and watch over us until me meet again in heaven. We will always love you and keep you close to our heart.’

Her son Junal said: ‘Our mother, kind hearted, generous and a well-respected woman in both of our lives. You were the core of the family who kept is together.

‘In times of difficulty you showed us the way forward to happiness and success. Your priority for us was a good education and a bright future. You taught us right from wrong which we appreciate.

‘You worked tirelessly to give us everything that we have today. When we achieved good grades and merit, your pat on our backs encouraged us more.’

Standing outside the cathedral alongside their local MP Charlotte Leslie and MP Keith Vaz, who has been campaigning on behalf of the family, Mr Barboza said the family ‘could not have foreseen the unprecedented tragedy that has unfolded in our lives’.

‘The events of the last week have shattered our lives. We barely have the strength to withstand the grief and sorrow.’

Hoax: Australian DJ Mel Greig who posed as the Queen during the prank call

As besieged radio host Mel Greig remained in hiding, it was revealed that her father was so worried about threats to his family that he hired a security guard to protect his home.

A neighbour of 30-year-old Miss Greig’s father, whose full identity has not been revealed, said he, too, had gone into hiding as the furore over the royal radio prank raged on.

Neighbours in the Happy Valley suburb of Adelaide said that if Miss Greig intended spending Christmas with her father and other family members it was unlikely to be in Mr Greig’s house.

One neighbour told Adelaide’s Sunday Mail that Mr Greig, who has not been well, had not been seen at the house for more than a week – and before he vanished he was so concerned for his family's life he had hired a security guard to watch the property.

‘The guard was hired to sit out the front of the house, keeping watch around the clock,’ said the neighbour.

The neighbour – who wished to remain anonymous – said she had been told by the guard that threatening messages had been left on the family’s answering machine from all over the world.

‘It’s just so sad how the whole thing got out of hand,’ she said.

‘I know the dad hasn’t been well so this wouldn’t be doing him any good.’

Nurse Jacintha Saldanha committed suicide in the days following the prank call in which Miss Greig and her radio co-host Michael Christian pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles and was put through to Kate Middleton’s private ward at King Edward VII by Miss Saldanha.

As the controversy refused to subside, Miss Greig and Mr Christian remained in hiding, friends of Miss Greig saying she was in a fragile state.

But she wanted to thank people in her home town of Adelaide for their support.

In a public message she issued yesterday through Adelaide’s Sunday Mail and Sydney’s Daily Telegraph she said:

‘The love and support that I’m getting from everyone in Adelaide has helped me immensely through this.

‘Adelaide is my home and to see them rally behind me has been incredible.

‘Nothing will ever take away the pain I feel for Jacintha and her family, but the one thing I’ve learned from this situation is to use the support around you.’

Friends said her primary concern remains for the family of nurse Saldanha.
