Arsenal’s new kit appeared to have been leaked when a fan posted a picture of shirts already on sale in China, ahead of the official release date of the new strip. 

Officials at the Emirates were tight-lipped after being shown the pictures but maintained that any merchandise available or sold before July 10 isn’t recognised as official by the club. 

The photograph, originating from the account of supporter James Clarke, is said to have been taken in Puma’s store in Macau.

Leaked: Arsenal's new Puma kit appears to be on sale in China ahead of the official release date

The home shirt - an unsurprising red number with white trim - was at the head of a rack to include what could be Wojciech Szczesny’s goalkeeper jersey. 

And it matches the design worn by Thierry Henry in January when former Olympic sprinter Linford Christie revealed all by accident. 

Puma have landed a huge £150million deal with the Gunners after the club ended their long-running association with Nike, with the new strips to be unveiled in a fortnight’s time at the beginning of pre-season.

Kit leaks are now common place, with the Premier League’s top sides almost powerless to plug the embarrassing leaks. 

Puma refused to comment.

Revealed? Former athlete Linford Chrsitie tweeted a picture of Bacary Sagna, Thierry Henry and Olivier Giroud in what is seemingly Arsenal's new Puma attire back in October
