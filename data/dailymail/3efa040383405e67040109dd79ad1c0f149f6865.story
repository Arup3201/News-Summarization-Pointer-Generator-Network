A violent temper: Vincent Sisounong has been accused in the grisly crime, one which his brother believes he committed

Two men have been accused of breaking into a Washington home last month looking to torture strangers for a ‘thrill kill' but their target escaped before dying.

Vincent Sisounong, 21, and Blessing Gainey, 19, broke into a Kirkland home Oct 12, pulled a teenager from his bed and methodically stabbed and sliced his writhing body while trying to slowly bleed him to death - at one point even trying to hack one of his legs off, officials said.

Though Mr Sisounong's mother told MailOnline she does not believe he committed the horrific attack, the troubled man's brother told a local television station he believes the 21-year-old was involved.

Prosecutors told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer the 18-year-old victim suffered ‘bone-deep cuts to his legs, shoulder and head and was losing large amounts of blood’ by the time paramedics arrived.

Charging papers detailed by the Post-Intelligencer contend the two men broke into the house just before 6am with plans to kill.

‘They broke into the home of complete strangers with the intent to kill,’ said the papers.

The son of Laotian immigrants, Mr Sisounong told detectives that he wanted the victim to ‘fight for his life’ and acknowledged the torture was enjoyable.

Sound asleep in his bedroom, the unidentified victim was dragged from his bed a knife-point with threats made against his sister and parents if he failed to go along with the plan, said the papers.

The doomed teen was moved to the family’s garage, where the two sickos first tried to chop off his leg, detectives said.

Quickly losing blood, he somehow broke free and set off a car alarm in the garage - but was ordered to his knees as Mr Sisounong hacked at his shoulder and face - before escaping back into the house and cowering inside a bathroom.

Shocking crime: This is the neighborhood where the attack happened, though it is not clear in which house it occurred

While Mr Gainey ran from the home, his partner went after the tortured teen, breaking through the door and trying to stab the 18-year-old through the door in a scene reminiscent of the film ‘The Shining.’

The terrified teenager punched his attacker in the face, causing him to flee the grisly scene just before cops arrived.

Hospitalized for five days, the teen has mostly recovered from his injuries, but his tormenters remain in custody.

Motivated by ‘pleasure and greed,’ the two sociopaths ‘broke into the home of complete strangers and tortured and stabbed a young man,’ the prosecutor said in the charging papers, according to the Post-Intelligencer.

‘They made repeated threats to kill the victim and stabbed him in his legs, shoulder, head and hands,’ the papers continued.

Cops charged Mr Gainey after matching a fingerprint left on the teen’s door, he copped to the charged and turned stoolie on Mr Sisounong, said the papers.

Further questioning of the duo led investigators to determine that Mr Sinsounong initially found the sleeping teen on the home’s third floor while Mr Gainey waited on the floor below.

‘Sisounong stated that after finding (the teen) and his sister asleep in their beds on the third floor, he returned to Gainey on the second floor and stated that they had to kill them,’ detectives said.

‘Sisounong said that Gainey agreed to participate after debating the decision for ‘3-5 minutes,’ setting the horrifying chain of events into motion.

Mr Sisounong, who appears to have been the main aggressor in the attack, said he ‘really wanted’ to kill the young man after talking to him for about half an hour, officials said.

Phayvanh Sisounong, mother of Mr Sisounong, refuses to believe her son was responsible for the attack. When asked by MailOnline, she replied 'not really, I don't believe my son [would] do anything bad.'

The shocked mother said her son is the father of a five-year-old boy. She also revealed that his father was never part of his life and that she hasn't spoken her son since his incarceration.

Though not still with the mother of his son, the 22-year-old woman is the only person who can visit Mr Sisounong in jail, as Ms Sisounong must provide round-the-clock care for her disabled daughter.

She noted that he has never been in trouble in school or with the law in the past, to her knowledge.

Additionally, Dan Sayaseuth, Mr Sisounong's brother, told KIRO that the troubled young man has a violent temper and has threatened him with violence in the past.

He also said he does believe Mr Sisounong was capable of the attack.

The brothers do not get along, according to Ms Sisounong, who admitted she does not talk to Mr Sayaseuth.

Neither has a ‘substantial criminal history,’ according to the Post-Intelligencer. They are scheduled to be arraigned Nov 12, according to the Seattle Times.
