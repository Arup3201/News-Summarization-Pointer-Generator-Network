Mary Berry effect: The WI's membership peaked at 211,000 in 2011/2012  - the highest since the 1970s, with the Mary Berry's popularity thought to have had an influence

Forget Calendar Girls. The WI has another phenomenon to thank for its latest resurgence – the Mary Berry effect.

The woman who inspired a new generation to master the mysterious arts of fondant fancies and filo pastry has also, it appears, helped revive the Women’s Institute.

Last year 22,600 women joined the WI, with overall membership for 2011/2012 peaking at 211,000 – the highest since the 1970s. Some new members are as young as 20.

This huge rise has been credited in part to Miss Berry, 77, and the popularity of the Great British Bake Off.

As a result, 144 new institutes have been created across England and Wales in the past year.

Ruth Bond, chairman of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes, said: ‘Home baking has been enjoying a great resurgence over the past few years and many new WI members have told us that brushing up on their baking skills was one of the reasons why they decided to join the organisation.

‘I’m sure that programmes like the Great British Bake Off have inspired more women to take up baking because the experts make it look quite 
easy and fun and take away the fear factor.

'Of course it’s practice that
 makes things work like a dream and we offer the chance to get better 
and better.

‘It’s a pity we don’t have cooking in schools in a more determined way. I
 grew up knowing how to cook but a lot of people haven’t and there are 
lots of basics in baking and cookery that you really need to know to 
make things work.

Inspiration: This membership surge rise has been credited in part to Miss Berry, 77, and the popularity of the Great British Bake Off

‘And the great thing about baking is that you can quite quickly have a 
decent end result that is enjoyable for the taste buds but also gives 
you a sense of achievement at having made something that looks good and 
that people say they enjoy.’

Post-war austerity prompted a steady rise in the number of women joining institutes around the country. In 1973 there were 442,158. 

But that slumped in the 80s and 90s as women took a stand against being labelled as housewives putting many institutes on the brink of closure.

The Great British Bake Off has earned its makers between £5million and £10million, according to analysts, and they are not the only ones reaping the benefits.

Cake-making groups are rapidly 
becoming the new book clubs, with members meeting regularly to swap 
recipe ideas and sample each other’s offerings.

The
 Clandestine Cake Club, which has branches across the UK as well as 
abroad in countries including Spain, Switzerland and Australia, seen 
membership figures increase from 1,000 last year to 6,000 this year.

Success: Ruth Bond, chairman of the National Federation of Women¿s Institutes, said: 'I'm sure that programmes like the Great British Bake Off have inspired more women to take up baking'

There are now 150 clubs, compared with 19 this time last year.

Sales of baking equipment have also increased. John Lewis has reported a 126 per cent rise in sales of Silicone Bakeware and cooling racks are up 70 per cent, year on year.

Lakeland sold 1.5 million pieces of bake and ovenware in 2012 and reported a 30 per cent rise overall in the sales of cookery products.

Nicola Hattersley, cookshop buyer for John Lewis said: ‘We have definitely seen an increased interest from our customers for baking accessories.

‘I am sure that programs like The Great British Bake Off have reignited a passion for home baking and have inspired lots of people to try their hand at making freshly baked cakes and pastries.’
