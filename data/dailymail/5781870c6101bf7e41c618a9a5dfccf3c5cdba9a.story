A friend of Michael Brown, who was with the teen when he was shot dead by police on Saturday, said he watched as the 18-year-old held up his empty hands to a cop and begged him not to shoot because he was unarmed.

Dorian Johnson, 22, was walking with his friend 'Big Mike' on Saturday evening, when he said the pair were stopped by an officer in a squad car in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri.

Mr Johnson said that he and Brown were walking home from a store when the cop told them to get out of the street and 'get the f***' on to the sidewalk'.

Johnson said they kept walking after explaining to the officer they were almost home. The officer then pulled his truck in front of them and blocked the road, Johnson said. 

The friend said the officer threw open the door which slammed closed again after bouncing off Brown. It was then that the officer grabbed his friend by the neck.

He told MSNBC today: 'The time frame was 60 seconds or less, it got out of hand really quickly.'

Johnson said that the officer had drawn his gun by this time and threatened to shoot Michael. 

'I seen the fire come out of the barrel,' he told the network. 'I could see so vividly what was going on because I was so close.'

Johnson said the first time the officer fired, he and Brown got scared and ran away but he could already see that the teenager had blood coming down his shirt where he had been shot. 

The 22-year-old ducked behind a car but Brown kept running. 

'He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and he started to get down,' Johnson said.  

The 22-year-old said: '[Brown] stopped, turned with his hands up and said ''I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!''

'But the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.' 

The eye-witness said despite the teenager's protests, the officer shot again, hitting Brown and leaving him on the ground. 

Mr Johnson told the TV station on Tuesday that he ran in terror to his apartment and vomited, before checking he had not been shot.

He came out from his apartment to see his friend lying dead in the middle of the street.

'We wasn’t causing harm to nobody,' Johnson added. 'We had no weapons on us at all.'

The 22-year-old spoke to MSNBC on Tuesday alongside his attorney, and former St Louis' mayor, Freeman Bosley Jr. 

The lawyer said that he has offered police the opportunity to interview his client about Saturday's tragic events but they have declined to take it.  

Mr Bosley said: 'They didn't even want to talk to him. They don’t want the facts. What they want is to justify what happened … what they are trying to do now is justify what happened instead of trying to point out the wrong. Something is wrong here and that’s what it is.'

Police have offered a different version of events of the altercation which led to the fatal shooting on Saturday. 

Authorities said that while the officer was exiting his car, he was physically assaulted by Brown and there was a struggle over the cop's weapon.

Police do not dispute that the officer shot the subject multiple times and that the deceased was not armed. 

The body of Michael Brown lies in a Ferguson street on Saturday. The unarmed teenager's death, at the hands of a police officer, has sparked riots in the quiet suburban neighborhood 

Ferguson police said on Tuesday that they would not be releasing the name of the officer involved in the shooting because of death threats on social media.  

Brown's shooting has sparked riots in the streets of suburban Ferguson, Missouri, where 70 per cent of the population is African-American but in a 53-strong police force there are only three black officers.

Riot police deployed tear gas and bean-bag rounds on Monday night to disperse an agitated crowd.

Mr Johnson said that he was still in shock over his friend's death and how quickly the situation escalated.

He described the 18-year-old, who was due to start technical college on Monday, as 'a quiet, kind and gentle' person.
