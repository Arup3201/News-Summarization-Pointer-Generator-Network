Microsoft has announced a new, free version of its classic Flight Simulator that will be available to all Windows users. The game is now simply called Flight, and will be available to download this spring.

Not only does the game include an 
accurate simulated Earth, with realistic weather,  each plane has a working cockpit, and you can pilot them by 
manipulating controls with your mouse.

The game is a successor to Microsoft's classic Flight Simulator games - but updated with realistic weather patterns and cutting-edge 3D graphics

You can opt for a forward view, cut the plane out of the picture, or go for maximum realism and confront yourself with a full, working instrument panel

The Icon A5 plane and the whole island of Hawaii are free - but if you want to explore the game's huge 3D version of the world, it costs

'Microsoft Flight will be available as a free download this spring, giving players the freedom to fly the skies over the beautiful Big Island of Hawaii, complete a variety of exciting missions,' said the company today.

The game also has an 'easy mode' which allows gamers to pilot their plane using arcade-style controls.

The whole island of Hawaii is free. Gamers who sign up using an Xbox or Windows gaming account can add bonus content including extra planes such as a Boeing Stearman.

Gamers can also buy additional content including new challenges, new planes, and new areas.

The game also gives players the chance to fly the hi-tech Icon A5 before it actually comes out at the end of the year.

Designed by the world-class aeronautical engineers behind the Voyager spaceship, X-Prize winning SpaceShipOne, and Virgin Galatic’s SpaceShipTwo, the ICON A5 is described as a 'jet ski for the skies'.

It will be the first free plane available to players of Flight.
