Katherine Russell, the widow of Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, has stopped co-operating with authorities as it emerged female DNA found on one of the detonated bombs does not belong to her.

Tsarnaev, who was later killed in a gunfight with authorities, called his wife in the hours after the FBI released surveillance images of him and his younger brother, Dzhokhar.

But only Russell knows what was said in the conversation, as she has stopped cooperating with authorities over recent days, the New York Times reported.

Authorities are skeptical of her 
insistence that she played no role in the attack or in helping the 
brothers escape the authorities following the release of the 
photographs, the Times reported.

Staying silent: Katherine Russell, the wife of Boston bomber suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her lawyer's office with attorney Amato DeLuca on Monday. She has reportedly stopped cooperating with authorities

A source told CNN that the bombs were built in the apartment that Tsarnaev shared with Russell and their three-year-old daughter. Residue samples were found on the kitchen table, the kitchen sink, and the bathtub, the source said.

Her silence comes as sources told the newspaper that the fingerprints and female DNA found on at least one of the bombs did not belong to her. Authorities had taken a sample from her this week.

Spokesman Jason Pack confirmed that 
agents investigating the Boston bombings visited the North Kingstown 
home of Russell's parents, where Tsarnaev's widow has been staying since
 the attacks.

An official had revealed that female DNA was found on at least one of the bombs, although investigators haven't determined whose it is or whether it means a woman helped the two suspects.

Her lawyer says Russell denies any 
involvement in the bombings, but authorities are still working to 
establish what exactly she knew - if anything - before or after the 
April 15 attacks.

On Wednesday, attorney Amato 
DeLuca insisted Russell 'will continue to meet with law enforcement, as
 she has done for many hours over the past week, and provide as much 
assistance to the investigation as she can'.

Russell met Tamerlan while she was a student at Suffolk University, according to her lawyer. She converted to Islam and they married in 2010 before having a daughter, now three.

Her husband was killed on April 18 following a shoot out with police in Watertown. Investigators say his younger brother hit him with a car as he fled the scene.

Body: A vehicle believed to be carrying Tsarnaev's body backs into an underground garage at the Dyer-Lake Funeral Home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. His family claimed his body on Thursday

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was caught the following day as he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard.

Tsarnaev's cause of death could be released on Friday. The state medical examiner's office will go public with that 
information once the funeral home files a death certificate.

Russell, who has been living with her 
parents in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, learned this week that the medical 
examiner was ready to release his body and wanted it released to his family.

Department of Public Safety spokesman Terrel Harris said a funeral home 
retained by Tsarnaev's family picked up the remains. He 
said he had no more information about plans for the body.

Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni, of Maryland, said Tuesday night the family would take the body.

'Of course, family members will take possession of the body,' Tsarni said. 'We'll do it. We will do it. A family is a family.'

The April 15 bombing, using pressure cookers packed with explosives, 
nails, ball bearings and metal shards near the marathon's finish line, 
killed three people and injured more than 180 others.

Russell's attorneys have previously said she and her family were in shock when
 they learned of the allegations against her husband and brother-in-law,
 Dzhokhar.
