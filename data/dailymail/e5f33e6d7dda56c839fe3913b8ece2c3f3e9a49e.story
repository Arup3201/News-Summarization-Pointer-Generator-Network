The top civil servant at the Home Office today came under pressure over 114 missing files related to allegations of child abuse over three decades.

Mark Sedwill revealed he has not even asked to see a list detailing what the documents related to, as he told MPs he presumed they had all been destroyed and not to 'assume there's anything sinister' at work. 

The home affairs select committee said a trawl of files last year was 'not satisfactory' and it was 'odd' that a report he commissioned had not been read by Home Secretary Theresa May.

Home Office permanent secretary Mark Sedwill told the home affairs committee that he did not inform Mrs May that his department had lost 114 files

Mr Sedwill came under pressure for not even having looked at the list of 114 files which have gone missing

MPs have condemned the loss of the documents on an 'industrial scale'. Today the committee demanded to know why Mr Sedwill did not have the details of the names and serial numbers of the files which were missing.

He has refused to name the 'mystery man' he asked to trawl the Home Office library, but insists he relied on their 'judgement'.

At the weekend Mr Sedwill revealed that a review carried out last year of 746,000 Home Office files covering 1979 to 1999 had identified ‘573 relevant files which had been retained’.

But he admitted that another 114 ‘potentially relevant files’ had been destroyed, missing or not found.

However, today Mr Sedwill said he did not know if the serial numbers of the missing files had been studied, to see if those adjacent in the records were also missing or if only those linked to child abuse allegations had been 'deliberately removed'.

Tory MP Nicola Blackwood said if there are no other cross-references to the missing files it would be 'somewhat sinister'.

Alarmingly, last year's trawl of files had unearthed 13 items of alleged child abuse, of which four had never been passed to the police.

Four of the cases involved members of staff at the Home Office who have been prosecuted and sacked in connection with 'pornographic images', Mr Sedwill revealed.

It follows the revelation that in 1983 Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens handed a dossier detailing allegations of abuse to the then-home secretary, Leon Brittan. But the Home Office now says it cannot find the file.

The handling of files at the Home Office has fuelled claims of an Establishment cover-up. 

Labour MP Keith Vaz called Mr Sedwill to give evidence to the home affairs committee after revealing the loss of the files

The Home Office has been given until noon on Friday to release details of the missing files to MPs.

Appearing before the home affairs select committee today, Mr Sedwill was challenged about his decision to commission an internal review last year of the way the Home Office dealt with allegations of abuse. 

Last year's review concluded the Home Office had behaved properly, but growing questions about a cover-up has triggered a fresh review. 

Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'There is a feeling in the committee that the first review was not satisfactory.'

He said there remains several issues which 'still need to be chased up'.

Mr Vaz demanded to know if Mr Sedwill had told Mrs May last year that his department could not find dozens of files.

'You didn't tell her then that 114 files had gone missing?' Mr Vaz asked. 

 Mr Sedwill replied: 'I don't recall doing so. I shared with the Home Secretary the executive summary and broad conclusions. I told her what we were doing with the material. 

'But it would not be appropriate for her or indeed for anyone other than a small number of people not least sensitive personal information within the report.

'Indeed I did not see all of the accompanying material myself.'

He added: 'I am concerned frankly about the 114. I am concerned about all the material that we cannot find.

'Most of these files were probably destroyed, because the kind of topics that they covered would have been subject to the normal file destruction procedures that were in place at that time.

'They cannot be confirmed to be destroyed because there is not a proper log of what was destroyed and what wasn't.'

But Mr Vaz said: 'This is an odd report that you have commissioned that the Home Secretary did not want to read.'

Later Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said:'There are clearly big questions for the Home Secretary to answer on how seriously the 2013 review into historic allegations of child abuse was taken. 

'Neither she nor her senior official appear to have been briefed on its contents, nor are they aware of the details of the 114 files that went missing.

'This evidence also shows that Theresa May's decision to instigate only a review of a review into the Home Office handling is simply not adequate. 

'Given the seriousness of the allegations and the weaknesses of the 2013 investigation she must now widen the remit of this latest review into the Home Office to ensure it has full investigative powers and has a free rein to look more widely into the way things were handled in the Home Office Whitehall and Westminster - regardless of how long ago these are said to have taken place.'

Home Secretary Theresa May has asked Peter Wanless, the chief executive of the NSPCC, to lead a review into the Home Office handling of historic allegations of child abuse

A dossier of allegations of abuse was first passed to then-Home Secretary Leon Brittan (left, leaving his home in London today) by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, but it has been lost or destroyed

Mrs May has asked Peter Wanless, the chief executive of the NSPCC, to lead a review into the Home Office handling of historic allegations of child abuse.

Mr Wanless will also examine an internal review into claims the Home Office funded the Paedophile Information Exchange, a paedophile campaign group that was disbanded in 1984.  His report is expected to take eight to 10 weeks.

Mrs May said she was confident that the work commissioned by Mr Sedwill was 'carried out in good faith', but added that with 'allegations as serious as these the public need to have complete confidence in the integrity of the investigation's findings'.

Last year's investigation found 13 items of information in Home Office files about alleged child abuse dating back to the period 1979-99, and passed police details of four of the items about which they were not already aware. But Mrs May told MPs that, while records of a number of letters from Mr Dickens were found, there was no sign of a 'Dickens dossier'.

The investigation found that 114 potentially relevant files were not available, and were presumed 'destroyed, missing or not found', although the independent investigator made clear that he found no evidence to suggest that the files had been removed or destroyed 'inappropriately'.

Mr Wanless is also to examine that finding that public funds totalling almost £500,000 were given to two organisations with links to the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE).

The Voluntary Services Unit (VSU) provided £65,750 to the Albany Trust between 1974 and 1980 and £410,500 to the Princedale Trust between 1974 and 1984.
