Threat to national security: A group of retired generals 
are targetting junk food served in school cafeterias saying too many 
Americans are overweight

Army recruiting Sergeant Daniel Mecum
told Fox News: 'Since I’ve been part of US Army Recruiting Command, 
I’ve seen quite a few people wanting to enlist in the Army who are a 
little bit above our height and weight standards, yes.'

One new recruit knows only too well 
how too many servings of burgers and fries are stopping many young 
Americans from serving their country.

Kevin Ammerman, who weighed a hefty 
350lbs, was repeatedly turned away from the recruiting office because he
was simply too fat to fight.

But over the course of four years 
determined Kevin managed to shed an incredible 160lbs, the weight of an average man, 
and has just been accepted into the army.

Mr Ammerman told Fox News: 'I was always big.

'I went to every branch and I got shot down because I was too big. They're not going to take you at 350 pounds.'

Mr Ammerman had always dreamt of joining the army but admitted his love of McDonald's lunches and junk food in general had stood in his way.

Now he is due to ship out for on October 29.

He added: 'So I would come back and they'd say lose a little more, lose a little more.

'I Just squeaked it in.'

Recruiting Sergeant Mecum praised Mr Ammerman's determinatoin but pointed out he was one of the rare success stories.

'I think it's amazing,” Sgt. Mecum told Fox. 'I felt that he was amazing ever since I first met him here in the office.'
