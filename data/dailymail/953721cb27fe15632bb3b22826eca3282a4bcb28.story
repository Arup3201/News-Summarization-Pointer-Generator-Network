A tangled web of tweets, texts and emails has emerged after a young woman claimed to have incriminating photographs of newlywed quarterback Robert Griffin III.

Meredith Barber, a Virginia Commonwealth University student and former Hooters waitress, has offered to sell the photographs, including one of Griffin allegedly exposing his penis, to a sports and gossip website.

The story began on Friday when Busted Coverage received an email from 'Brandon K', who had done a bit of Twitter sleuthing and discovered something fishy going on between Griffin, a young woman called Meredith Barber and William Mallow, one of Griffin's groomsmen, dating to the night of Griffin's wedding to Rebecca Liddicoat.

Player: Griffin plays for the Washington Redskins

'So I was looking through RGIII’s Twitter feed the night of his wedding,' Brandon K told the website.

He explains that he followed Griffin's retweets to William Mallow's account. On Mallow's Twitter feed, he found a retweet written by someone called @Mere.

'She looked hot so I looked at her feed,' said Brandon K.

'That night one of her friends tweeted 'RG III getting married today. Will @Mere__ crash the wedding?'

Committed: Griffin and Liddicoat were married almost two weeks ago

Brandon K says @Mere__ allegedly responds with, 
'I could show Becky this though,' posted with a picture from her cell 
phone of a man lifting up his shirt.

'Come on bae,' the Washington Redskins quarterback allegedly wrote to Barber before sending the image, accompanied by a blushing smiley icon.

He then allegedly sent her the photo of his bare stomach muscles but the photo cuts off before his head.

When Barber didn't respond, he wrote, “Well ok I give up I guess. See you in a few weeks kid.”

The exchange is dated 1am July 6 - the early hours of RG III's wedding day.

After Busted Coverage went live with that story, they were contacted by Meredith Barber herself. She asked the site to take down the story, and in exchange, she'd sell them 'inappropriate pictures,' as well as screenshots of chats and texts.

As proof, she emailed the site a photo of a shirtless man (again cut off before his head) she claims is Griffin and promised there are more, allegedly including 'one with his d*** out.'

Barber allegedly told the site's editor, Joe Kinsey, that she would give him full access to the story if he would make her anonymous, for the sake of her 'reputation and family'.

What Kinsey actually did was publish his entire exchange with Barber on the site.

Barber repeatedly asks Kinsey to give her an idea of how much he'll pay her for the photographs and screenshots. 

'Just give me an offer,' she purportedly writes. 'Or I will shop it around.'

When Kinsey tells her he can pay $500 for the images, she tells him the figure is 'nowhere near' what she's after and cuts off communication.

Around the same time, Dead Spin received an email from someone claiming to be Meredith's ex-boyfriend.

The 'ex-boyfriend' offered to sell the site 'information, text messages, FaceTime screenshots, pictures, you name it, proving that it was indeed him and he's been up to it for some time.'

He also claimed to have images of the football star's penis and demanded $25,000 for the material.

The site declined his offer, but noted that the wording and tone of the 'ex-boyfriend' was very similar to that of Meredith Barber.

Next, Joe Kinsey at Busted Coverage received an email from Mallow, the friend and groomsman of Griffin who appears to be the connection between Griffin and Barber. His correspondence is duly published on Busted Coverage, too.

Silent: Griffin, who is in Europe on his honeymoon, has not commented on the scandal

Mallow says that Barber is only after money and that her story is false.

'We
 both know that Meredith is looking for attention/money. I know this is 
what you do for a living and you thought that this would be a golden 
opportunity but the fact of the matter is that this is completely 
false,' he writes.

'I 
was with Robert the night in question, and there was zero texting of 
other girls, much less selfie stomach shots. That isn’t even close to 
what the bathroom of the suite we were in looked like,' reads the 
missive and includes screen shots of a text exchange Mallow had with 
Barber in which she claims someone took her phone and wrote the emails.

Up until now, 23-year-old Washington Redskins quarterback Griffin has enjoyed a squeaky-clean image. His successes both on and off the field are numerous.

He has endorsement deals from companies such as Adidas, Castrol Motor Oil, EA Sports, EvoShield, Gatorade, Nissan, and Subway.

According to ESPN's Dollars blog, Griffin has 'earned more than any other rookie in NFL history before throwing his first regular-season pass,' largely as a result of endorsements.

His recent marriage to long-time girlfriend Rebecca Liddicoat took place in Denver, Colorado.
