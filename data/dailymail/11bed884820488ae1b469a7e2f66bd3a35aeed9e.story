A California teenager was arrested Thursday for stealing a piece of the wreckage left from Saturday's car crash that killed actor Paul Walker and his friend.

Jameson Witty, 18, was arrested Thursday morning at his California home after an investigation led police to his doorstep, officials announced Thursday afternoon.

Police did not say what brought them to Mr Witty’s home, but MailOnline easily found pictures of the stolen car part posted Sunday to Instagram by Mr Witty.

The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed.

The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police.

The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft.

A search warrant was executed Thursday at Mr Rodas’ home, police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof - and arrested him on the spot.

A MailOnline review of Mr Witty Instagram profile showed that he also has a penchant for fast cars and risk taking. Pictures of him speeding and with injuries sustained in BMX races fill his profile.

He also sent out a tribute to Mr Walker and Mr Rodas, writing 'DEC. 28th we will be having a car meet and cruise, at the crash site to celebrate the lives of Paul Walker and Rodger Rodas. We will also be raising money, to continue the donations of Paul Walker's charity.'

The hashtags #fun and #fastcars are prominent on his Instagram page.

Mr Witty was charged with felony grand theft and tampering with evidence, he is being held on $20,000 bail.

A booking photo will not be released, according to KTLA.

A second suspect, a 25-year-old male, is also facing similar charges but is out of the state and is discussing the terms of his surrender with police.

The investigation into the crash that killed both Mr Walker and Mr Rodas is still ongoing.
