The nation’s benefits bill jumped by more than £4billion last year with some areas claiming seven times more in handouts than others.

The total cost was £121billion, according to figures from the Department for Work and Pensions – up from £116.7billion in 2009/10.

After pension costs are stripped out, Knowsley in Merseyside emerges as the ‘benefits capital’ of Britain.

Biggest bill: Kowsley (pictured) in Merseyside is the 'benefits capital' of Britain after amassing £146million in claims last year

Lowest cost: Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the Western Isles (pictured), off Scotland, received just £20.1million in hand-outs

Last year people in the constituency pocketed £146million in benefits, mostly relating to unemployment and disability.

The handouts are equal to £1,842 for every adult in the borough, which is one of Labour’s safest seats.

The figures do not include housing benefit, which would drive the total bill far higher.

Half of the ten constituencies with the highest benefits bills were on Merseyside, with another two in Glasgow.

The Knowsley total is more than seven times the amount claimed by residents of the Western isles, off Scotland.

The lowest benefits bill on the mainland was in North East Hampshire, where residents claimed £25.6million.

The figure is equal to £352.86 for every adult in the constituency, which is a safe Tory seat.

Most of the areas with the lowest levels of benefits claims were leafy suburbs in the South of England.

Employment
minister Chris Grayling said: ‘These figures show how important the 
Government reforms are through initiatives like our new Work Programme, 
the benefit cap and Universal Credit. We are building a system that is 
much more fit for purpose.’

The figures underline the difficulty ministers have faced in trying to trim the welfare state at a time of austerity.

Rising
unemployment has led to a surge in benefit claims, while efforts to get
millions of people on incapacity benefits back into work are still in 
the foothills.

More than five million people of working age are now on out-of-work benefits.

The figures, which were released to Parliament last night, will also increase Coalition tensions over last week’s decision to raise benefits by 5.2 per cent next year.

Many Tory MPs are furious at the move, which contrasts sharply with a freeze in working tax credits and a 1per cent pay cap on workers in the public sector.

Critics say it undermines the Government’s pledge to ‘make work pay’ and undermines the incentive for the unemployed to take a job.

The bumper increase in benefits was demanded by the Liberal Democrats as part of the price for supporting George Osborne’s  growth plan.
