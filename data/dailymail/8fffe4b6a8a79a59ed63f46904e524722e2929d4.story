One of the world's most influential bankers said today that the Euro currency has proved 'a great success' despite the debt problems gripping some members of the eurozone.

The comments were made by the head of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet who was speaking with Poland's central bank head Marek Belka at a conference organized by the National Bank of Poland.

Mr Trichet said: 'The euro as a currency is a great success indeed.'

He said it remains a credible currency because 'it is backed by remarkable fundamentals.'

Despite Mr Trichet's claims, European leaders were today battling to save the single currency from meltdown as the debt crisis threatened to engulf major economies such as France.

The Continent’s top brass kicked off a weekend of talks in Brussels – but admitted that a comprehensive deal to shore up the euro will not be reached.

It came as an international ratings agency warned that a double-dip recession in the region would see France stripped of its coveted AAA credit score.

Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal would also be rocked by further downgrades, according to Standard & Poor’s.

Europe would have to raise hundreds of billions of euros to protect the region’s banks and prop up debt-ridden countries, the S&P report said.

It underlined the scale of the task facing European leaders this weekend.

But the summit in Brussels has been thrown into disarray by a row between France and Germany – Europe’s two biggest economic powers – over how to fight the debt crisis.

Leaders will now hold a second meeting on Wednesday to thrash out the toughest issues after conceding that no deal will be reached this weekend.

But the problems currently engulfing the euro are not putting Poland off joining the currency.

Mr Belka - Poland's Central Bank head - echoed Mr Trichet's optimism and said his country remains 'strongly committed' to adopting the euro currency - though he said it wouldn't be wise to set a specific target date yet.

He added that it was impossible to ignore the debt crisis gripping the eurozone.

Despite his positive attitude to the euro, Mr Belka said 'it wouldn't be wise 
to determine a specific date' but stressed Poland must still prepare 
itself for the eventual change.

Mr Trichet is retiring, with Bank of Italy chief Mario Draghi becoming the new head of the European Central Bank on November 1.
