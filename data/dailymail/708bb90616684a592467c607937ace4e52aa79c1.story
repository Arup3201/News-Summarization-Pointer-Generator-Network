A white bus driver's 
story that a religious book in his shirt pocket blocked bullets as he 
was attacked by three black men isn't supported by evidence and testing,
 Dayton police said Wednesday as they closed the case, which had been 
investigated as a possible hate crime.

Bus driver Rickey Wagoner's story that a religious book in his shirt pocket blocked bullets as he was attacked by three black men isn't supported by evidence and testing

Rickey 
Wagoner, 49, told police he was outside his city bus Feb. 24 when men 
assaulted him.

He said that two bullets hit the inch-thick book 
containing Bible verses and that one hit his leg and that he was stabbed
 in the arm, according to a police report.

The report also said Wagoner 
told police he grabbed the gun and shot at the fleeing men.

Wagoner had told police that the assailants were black and that he thought the attack might have been a gang initiation.

According to the New York Post, Wagoner called a 911 dispatcher stating: 'I've been hit in the leg. My chest feels like I've been hit with a sledgehammer.'

He later told police that one of the alleged attackers had told another that he needed to 'shoot a polar bear... if you want to be all the way in the club.'

'Polar bear' is a term for a white person, the supposed use of which gave the FBI reason ton investigate Wagoner's story as a potential hate crime.

But his account wasn't found to be factual, Police Chief Richard Biehl said at a news conference.

'This
 assault, as reported, is not true, not accurate,' Biehl said.

Police 
did not say Wagoner made up the story and didn't explain why he would 
have made the report.

Biehl did say it appeared Wagoner owed on back 
taxes.

A recording at a phone listing for Wagoner said the voice mail could not accept more messages.

No
 criminal charges have been filed.

But the Greater Dayton Regional 
Transit Authority said Wednesday that it has charged Wagoner with 
violating its employee standards.

Police did 
extensive testing, including simulating the shots fired into the book.

Biehl said it wasn't credible to believe that bullets didn't pass 
through the book into Wagoner.

Biehl also said that only Wagoner's DNA was found at the scene and that his injuries weren't consistent with defensive wounds.

A blue bandana found at the scene was found to have only dog hairs on it, and a surveillance video that captured the bus recorded the sound of five gunshots when Wagoner claimed that there were only three fired.

Wagoner's screams can be heard on the video however on the 911 call the 320-pound bus driver does not appear winded despite claiming he'd run up to 300 feet and fought for his life.
