They represent war, pain and suffering the world over but artists have decided to customise AK47 assault rifles to highlight a global ceasefire movement.

Famous names such as Damien Hirst, Antony
Gormley and Jeremy Deller are among those who have worked with 
decommissioned guns to contribute to the display of works which will be 
auctioned next month.

Jake and Dinos Chapman have also equipped two tiny mannequins with the weapons for the AKA Peace exhibition being staged at London’s ICA.

The artworks have been created for Peace One Day, an annual event which pushes for a truce in armed conflicts around the world.

The exhibition was originally conceived by 
photographer Bran Symondson and now curated by artist Jake Chapman.

Mr Chapman said: 'I am not readily 
associated with a sense of philanthropic optimism, but after a meeting 
with Jeremy Gilley at Peace One Day, my pessimism was suspended in 
favour of supporting this audacious attempt to intervene against human 
injustice.

Striking: 'Power is the Problem' by Sarah Lucas. The exhibition highlights a global ceasefire movement.

'We have therefore assembled a number of artists prepared to 
do what they can to collaborate against apathy.'

Mr Gilley said: 'AKA Peace is a really profound project; turning a 
weapon of destruction into a weapon of peace is awesome.

'The benefits of
awareness and finance to help Global Truce 2013 is a great outcome.'
