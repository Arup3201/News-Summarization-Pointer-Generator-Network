A Southern California woman who killed a two-year-old girl by feeding her chili powder as punishment has been sentenced to 15 years to life in state prison.

Amanda Sorensen of Apple Valley was sentenced yesterday in a Victorville courtroom, the Victorville Daily Press reported. 

The 24-year-old was convicted of second-degree murder last fall in the death of toddler Joileen Garcia, who would have turned five years old in a few weeks.

Sorensen - who was the caretaker of the toddler and her boyfriend's three other children on the day of the incident - tried to discipline her boyfriend's daughter for defecating in her pants by giving her chili powder

The terms of the sentencing were issued yesterday after probation officials considered Sorensen's acknowledgement of wrongdoing and her remorse, as well as her previously clean criminal history.

The incident resulting in the child's death took place two years ago. 

At the time, Sorensen - who was the carer of the toddler and her boyfriend's three other children on the day of the incident - tried to discipline her boyfriend's daughter for defecating in her pants by giving her chili powder, according to a report by a San Bernardino County Probation Department officer.

Joileen was potty training and had several accidents throughout the day. At one point Sorensen asked the girl if she had gone 'potty' to which the child responded 'no', a probation report obtained by the Victorville Daily Press reported.

When it was revealed that the toddler had defecated in her pants, she was scolded by Sorensen for lying. 

Sorensen accepted a plea bargain that dismissed the second charge of assault on a child causing death that carries a sentence of 25 years to life

Police were called to the home after Joileen began coughing uncontrollably, expelling powder from her mouth and turned blue

The woman then placed chili powder into the girl's mouth as punishment, ordering her to swallow it. She was not aware of how much she had placed in her mouth, but knew it was a lot as the bottle was light, the report said.

Sorensen cupped her hand over the child's mouth to prevent her from spitting it out. 

Joileen began coughing uncontrollably, expelling powder from her mouth and turned blue at which Sorensen attempted to perform rescue breathing and chest compressions. The woman then called 911. 

The toddler had a seizure and was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead.

The toddler's grandmother, Lillian Garcia, told Sorensen, who has her own daughter (center), that she was pathetic and took a way a sweet innocent child, and hoped that she would think of Joileen often

The cause of Joileen's death was found to be asphyxia due to forced inhalation of chili powder and the death was ruled a homicide, according to a forensic pathologist

The cause of Joileen's death was found to be asphyxia due to forced inhalation of chili powder and the death was ruled a homicide, according to forensic pathologist Dr Rhee.

Details in the report said that in an interview with Sorensen's boyfriend, he said chili powder was not used routinely as a way of punishment on the children but that liquid chili sauce had been used previously. 

Chili's main ingredient capsaicin is an irritant in humans and other mammals, causing a burning sensation in the tissues with which it comes into contact.

Airway resistance increases following inhalation of capsaicin in both mild asthmatics and non-asthmatics.

Capsaicin can be fatal in large quantities. Symptoms of overdose include difficulty breathing, convulsions, and changes in skin color.

Sorensen's defense lawyer David Sanders said the woman was not aware that the powder would kill the child, that there was not an intent to kill and that it was a case of involuntary manslaughter.

The woman accepted a plea bargain that dismissed the second charge of assault on a child causing death that carries a sentence of 25 years to life.

Joileen's mother, grandmother and a 10-year-old relative appeared in court during the sentencing as they tearfully read victim impact statements. 

Supporters of the girl were also present wearing shirts with her picture that read 'In loving memory'.

Other family members were also present who thought the sentencing was not harsh enough. 

Brenda Lopez, Joileen's mother, said her daughter was tragically taken away from her and that she will suffer more than Amanda ever could. She also said that Joileen brought joy and smiles to everyone in her presence. 

Grandmother Lillian Garcia told Sorensen, who has her own daughter, that she was pathetic and took away a sweet innocent child, and hoped that she would think of Joileen often. 

Her boyfriend did not appear in court for the sentencing. 

The woman initially told authorities that the child had found the powder and consumed it on her own, according to the report.
