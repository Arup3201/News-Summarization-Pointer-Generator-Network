Victory: Jeremy Bamber was one of three killers to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights against their whole life terms

Victims’ families reacted with fury last night after European judges ruled serial killers must be given the right to seek parole.

In a hugely provocative decision, Strasbourg said murderers and rapists condemned to die behind bars must now be given a chance of freedom.

The families said the idea of the killers walking Britain’s streets again was a ‘horrendous prospect’ and ‘life must mean life’.

The whole-life tariff applies to 48 men and one woman – Rose West – whose crimes courts regard as so heinous they must never be let out.

But three of them – Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore – appealed to Europe, saying their sentences ‘undermined human dignity and destroyed the human spirit’. Vinter and Bamber even claimed their time in jail had left them ‘depressed and in despair’.

Yesterday the highest body of the European Court of Human Rights, the Grand Chamber, agreed with them.

It said refusing the 49 any prospect of release amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

All the killers must now be allowed a review – with the prospect of release if they have been ‘rehabilitated’ and are deemed harmless.

Tory MPs said the ruling was an 
attack on democracy that exposed the court’s ‘warped moral compass’. 
Justice Secretary Chris Grayling spoke of ‘a terrible day for British 
justice’.

Ministers are 
already in a stand-off with the court over its demand to lift the ban on
 prisoners voting and are furious over its decisions in favour of 
terrorists and criminals.

Writing
 in today’s Mail, Mr Grayling threatened to withdraw from the court’s 
control after the next election, and accused the judges of being 
‘misguided’ and trying to act like a ‘Supreme Court of Europe’.

Lisa Jones, whose father Keith Randles was Moore’s third victim, said she was ‘extremely upset’ the killer could be released.

The 45-year-old mother of three, from Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, said: ‘This man took away multiple lives in a horrific and premeditated way – why should he have the rights that he denied my father and his other victims?

‘For the last 16 years, our family have 
derived comfort from the knowledge that Moore would never be allowed to 
walk the streets again because of what he did. Now we urgently want to 
know if this means he can apply for parole, which would be a horrendous prospect.’

Moore, known as the ‘Man in Black’, killed four men in less than four months in 1995, stabbing them with a combat knife for ‘fun’.

Lynne Haygarth, 53, whose brother 
Edward Carthy, 28, was Moore’s second victim, said: ‘He’s less than 
human – why should he have rights? Did he consider Ted’s human rights 
when he decapitated him and did other unspeakable, twisted things to his
 body?

‘There is no way he can get parole, he must die in prison. Life should mean life, he does not deserve a second chance.’

The
 court indicated the lifers should first be given a review after 25 
years inside and then every few years afterwards if their appeal fails.

If ministers were to bow to the court’s demands, it would mean six lifers would instantly be entitled to demand their freedom.

They include Bamber, Dennis Nilsen, who 
killed 16 men in London in the late 70s and early 80s, and John Childs, 
who murdered six people including one child in the mid-70s.

The
 court heard that a whole-life sentence had repeatedly been ruled lawful
 by the British courts, including as recently as last year.

In 2003, the House of Lords said there was no reason why a crime or crimes shouldn’t merit it just for ‘pure punishment’.

Lord Steyn observed that ‘there are cases where the crimes are so wicked that even if the prisoner is detained until he or she dies it will not exhaust the requirements of retribution and deterrence’.

But, by a margin of 16 to one, the judges, including those from Latvia, Georgia, Liechtenstein and Montenegro, ruled in favour of the killers.

They said the authorities should review such sentences to see if the inmate has made ‘progress towards rehabilitation’ and keeping them behind bars was no longer justified.

The judgment cannot be appealed.

Award: The killers took their case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg

Former Labour Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, criticised the ruling which he said could mean the courts could never pass a sentence of longer than 25 years – because anyone reaching that point would automatically be entitled to a parole hearing.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling described the ruling as 'a terrible day for British justice'

Ministers are expected to resist implementing the ruling, but in time this could lead to compensation claims from the prisoners who are denied a review.

David Cameron was said to be ‘very, very, very, very disappointed’ with the decision. Home Secretary Theresa May, a staunch critic of the court, told the Commons the public would be dismayed.

Tory ex-justice minister Nick Herbert said: ‘This is one more dreadful judgement from this discredited court, after trying to give prisoners the vote and obstructing the deportation of terrorist suspects.

‘Once again they have put us in the intolerable position where our own Parliament and courts no longer have the final say on justice. The time has come to withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights and decide these matters for ourselves.’

Tory MP for Esher and Walton, Dominic Raab, said: ‘It shows the warped moral compass of the Strasbourg Court that it allows three brutal murderers to sue Britain for inhuman treatment for jailing them for life to protect the public.’

Bamber’s lawyer, Simon McKay, praised the ruling as ‘progressive and humane’.
