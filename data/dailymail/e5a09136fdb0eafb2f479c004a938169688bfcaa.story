Socceroos star Tim Cahill has been connected to an alleged tax avoidance scheme in the UK that has embroiled more than 200 wealthy British celebrities and investors. 

The fund was created by Ingenious Media in 2008 to take advantage of a policy set up by Gordon Brown when he was Chancellor, which allowed investors to slash their tax bills if they backed the film industry.

Documents show Cahill, who currently plays for the New York Red Bulls, is one of 229 sports stars, actors and politicians who paid a total of £1.2 billion ($2.2 billion) into Phoenix, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The film funding scheme was initially approved by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), but HMRC officials now believe that Phoenix might have been aimed primarily at avoiding tax and not bolstering the British film industry.

There is no suggestion Phoenix investors did anything illegal but HMRC officials wrote to them in May last year rejecting their claims for tax relief.

It is not known how much each individual paid into Phoenix but the average amount was £5.2million, and the minimum investment amount to be eligible for tax breaks was £100,000.

Among those who invested in schemes connected to Ingenious Media are David and Victoria Beckham, Tory MP Geoffrey Cox QC, Sir Michael Caine, and British celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.

Last month Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall said he left Phoenix in June after first joining in 2008 believing he was making a 'bona fide' investment in the British film industry.

He added: 'It seems from reports in the media that HMRC does have reservations about some of these types of investments.

'I always want to be transparent about and indeed comfortable with my investments and my tax affairs, so earlier this year I resigned my subscription to this particular investment and handed back all the tax gain I had made, plus interest, to HMRC.'

Phoenix bought the distribution and production rights to  the 2010 re-make of the 1980s TV series The A-Team and Gulliver' s Travels. Investors could make significant profits if the films prospered at the box office.

However, Ingenious Media, which ran the partnership, admitted in 2011 that 'box office performance had not met expectations' and was unlikely to deliver 'significant upside'.

Regardless of the poor returns, investors were able to claim tax relief worth about half the cash they put in.

Phoenix is one of more than 1,200 alleged avoidance schemes identified by HMRC where investors are being forced to hand over unpaid tax before their disputes are settled by a tribunal. .

Ingenious has denied that Phoenix, or any of its other film  investment schemes, are tax-avoidance structures.
