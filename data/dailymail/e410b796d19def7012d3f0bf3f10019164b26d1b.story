Michelle Obama and Beyonce better get used to laughing at themselves as Saturday Night Live will have at least one black female cast member by January to play both of them.

Rumors that a new player might be added to the cast started yesterday, when Gothamist reported that auditions were held earlier this month at the Groundlings theater for black female comediennes in L.A., following criticism that the show lacked diversity.

The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creater and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times yesterday that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season.

It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month (those asked to audition pictured)

According to Michaels, the much talked about L.A. audition was just one of several casting sessions leading up to the final audition held on Monday in New York for nine women.

Man behind the curtain: Lorne Michaels previously said that hiring a black actress was on the show's to do list

'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.'

Michaels added that as many as two of the nine that made it to the final round could make it onto the cast in January.

But he says he doesn't want to add too many women since the cast already has five. Right now, the SNL cast consists of five men and five women, with one female and six male featured players.

Michaels also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was initially hiring for the current season this past fall.

He saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for the final auditions.

'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said.

That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season.

Michaels says he can't remember ever adding a cew cast member in the middle of the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them into the last episodes of the season.

Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live
has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the 
1985-86 season on the show

No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since

While many have criticized the show for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do with his hiring decision.

'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.'

This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show.

The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag.

Laughing at themselves: When Kerry Washington hosted the show last month, the first skit made fun of the lack of black female cast members on the show by having Washington play Michelle Obama and Oprah in the same skit

Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past

As a result, there have been no sketches on the weekly program featuring First Lady Michelle Obama since Maya Rudolph left the cast in 2007.

The only exception to this came in November when Scandal star Kerry Washington was the guest host amid the diversity furor and she played Mrs Obama, Oprah and Beyonce in the same sketch as the show's way of poking fun at themselves.

'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Rudolph who is biracial.

'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.'

News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet.

Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance.

'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com.

'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said.

Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel.

'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said.

'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.'

Webb says she was invited to audition last summer, but was filming a television show and wasn't able to perform.

One of the comediennes- Brunson- has a fan on the inside, as Pharoah has publicly lobbied for her to get one of the coveted spots.Â

'Why do I think she should be on the show? Because she's black first of all, and she's really talented. She's amazing. She needs to be on SNL. I said it. And I believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year,' Pharoah told The Grio.

The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to several high-profile departures.

Seth Meyers is expected to leave the show mid-way through this season to replace Jimmy Fallon as the host of Late Night and Jason Sudeikis has confirmed that he will not be returning next season.
