Josie Cunningham claims people who 'whinge' about her nose should help fund £3,000 surgery to alter it

A controversial wannabe glamour model who received a free NHS breast enlargement is now urging the public to help fund a nose job.

Josie Cunningham, 23, who is heavily pregnant with her third child, claims people who ‘whinge’ about her nose should ‘put their money where their mouth is’ and buy her a new one.

The former escort, from Leeds, has set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claims she’s fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

On the website, which features pictures of her posing, she said: ‘Don't like my nose? Well put your money where your mouth is and buy me a new one.

‘Sick of people whinging about my nose! I get tweets everyday comparing me to "Miss Piggy". Decided I want a nose that’s crossed between Michelle Keegan & Jennifer Aniston.

‘So all you wimpy sissy boys out there who keep wanting me to dominate you and take your money...dig deep & cough up you horrible squirming little tramps!

‘So, considering many of you have such a massive issue with my nose, I think it’s only right that you buy me a new one!’

She goes on to say that ‘all major credit and debit cards are accepted :).’

The mother of two has even put up a message for those who don’t want to donate to her latest controversy.

She said: ‘Don't want to donate any money to me? Then stop whinging about my beak.’

It comes after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

The 23-year-old, who is heavily pregnant with her third child (pictured shopping in Leeds last week), said she is fed up with being compared to The Muppets' Miss Piggy and wants donations towards cosmetic surgery

As A-level exam results were released yesterday, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.'

Her latest offering came just a week after Miss Cunningham, whose baby son is due in October, revealed she was giving fans the chance to watch her give birth live on Skype.

At a cost of £200 each, 50 people will be able to log on to the video chat service and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

The wannabe model has already scooped a staggering £30,000 by selling four ringside seats to the birth of her third child at her home in Leeds.

Three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

Two were sold for £10,000 each while the other two went for £5,000 each.

Miss Cunningham said all tickets include travel and accommodation, while the more expensive ones will allow the ticket holder to film the birth and take photos.

She formed her latest Skype plan after her hopes of selling DVDs of the birth of her son through a chain of pound shops fell through.

As well as the £4,800 NHS breast surgery, which increased her bust from a 32A to 36DD, Miss Cunningham has also undergone Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

She claimed she needed the breast enlargement because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Earlier this year, she sparked further outrage after publicly considering aborting the son she is due to give birth to because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

Just weeks later, she claimed she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

Leeds City Council eventually decided to axe the service, prompting Miss Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’

She later added: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.'
