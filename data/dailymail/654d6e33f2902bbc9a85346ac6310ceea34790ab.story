Callous thieves who stole Christmas lights from a charity-run children's hospice were being hunted by police.

The heartless duo jumped out of a white van   before slashing the wires and ripping down the garden decorations at Julia's House in Poole, Dorset,

The theft was only discovered when staff at the  hospice, which cares for children suffering from terminal illnesses, arrived for work the next morning.

This is the moment that the callous thieves stole the Christmas lights from the garden at charity-run Julia's House in Poole, Dorset

Police have appealed for help in tracing the duo after branding their crime 'despicable'

The crime was caught on CCTV and police are now hunting the pair responsible.

Emma Shepherd, head nurse at the hospice, said: 'We are all so shocked that someone could steal from a children's hospice.

'We have children attending a sessions and staying this weekend and they will now miss out.

'Many of our children have sensory challenges or difficulties with their sight, but they can all see and enjoy lights.'

The hospice has been inundated with donations of Christmas lights and decorations, including from AFC Bournemouth footballer Harry Arter since the theft on Tuesday night.

PC Garry Weston, of Dorset Police, said: 'We know that a small light-coloured car or delivery van pulled up outside the hospice and a man got out of the passenger seat and walked toward the grounds of Julia's House.

'The van left the scene and the offender was seen to walk into the grounds of Julia's house before leaving carrying the lights.

'This was a despicable crime on a hospice which offers day and respite care for children with life-limiting illnesses.' 

The Grinch who stole Christmas cash: Thief caught on CCTV taking money which was going to be spent on children's Christmas party   

A career criminal, nicknamed 'the Grinch,' was behind bars after being caught on CCTV stealing money  raised for a children's Christmas party.

Andrew Woodrup, 35, snatched more than £300 collected by a community centre  to fund the celebration and buy each child a small gift.

Heartbroken volunteers, who discovered the theft, feared they would have to cancel the annual event at Burnley Wood Community Centre in Burnley, Lancashire, for up to 50 children.

Woodrup, who has clocked up more than 100 previous offences, had only just been released from prison when he carried out the raid on November 26.

The CCTV footage shows him prowling around the centre before helping himself to two money boxes in the main office.

Andrew Woodrup,35, was starting a 26 week prison sentence for stealing more than £300 raised by a community centre in Burnley, Lancashire, to fund a children's Christmas party. He was caught after being recognised from the CCTV footage 

Jobless Woodrup, who started breaking into houses at 13 and was hooked on drugs by 15,  was jailed for 26 weeks at Pennine Magistrates Court after admitting theft.

Magistrates' heard that he was identified through CCTV footage and footprints that were left at the scene.

When he was arrested  he initially claimed not to remember committing the offence, before later owning up.

He has now written an apology to the centre and claims he wants to repay the stolen money.

Mark Williams, defending, said Woodrup of Burnley, had lost his methadone prescription and lapsed back into taking heroin.

Speaking after the sentence, centre volunteer Karen Heseltine, 48, said: 'Anybody who steals is bad enough, but to steal from your own community and the local children is absolutely disgusting.

'He is like the Grinch who came in and stole Christmas from the kids.' 

Thanks to an urgent appeal the community have managed to raise enough money for the party to go ahead as planned.
