Third-seeded Simona Halep continued her strong start to the year with a 6-3, 6-2 first-round win over Karin Knapp of Italy at the Australian Open on Monday.

Halep, who opened the season by winning the Shenzen Open in China, was a quarterfinalist at last year's Australian Open, losing to eventual finalist Dominika Cibulkova.

The 23-year-old Romanian moved steadily up in the rankings last year, rising as high as No 2, after winning two titles and making it to the final of the French Open, where she lost to Maria Sharapova.

Elsewhere, teenage sensation Belinda Bencic was the first to fall, the 32nd-ranked Swiss losing to German world No 73 Julia Goerges 6-2 6-1.

Two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, seeded 27th, was also sent packing by Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia and her 23rd seeded Russian compatriot Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova soon followed, going down to Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer.  

Former Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki was another high-profile casualty, the 28th-seeded German upset in three sets by 71st-ranked Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
