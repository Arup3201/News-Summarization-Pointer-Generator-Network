Arturo Dodero Tello: the 29-year-old Peruvian national was arrested on November 28 in Lima on charges of conducting paedophile acts through the internet to some 500 child victims

An internet predator accused of 
blackmailing more than 500 children across the world into performing sex
 acts on camera before he sold the images has been arrested in Peru.

Arturo
 Dodero Tello, 29, considered the most prolific paedophile in the 
Spanish-speaking world, was detained on Thursday after an 18-month 
dual-continent undercover operation by police in Spain and Peru.

Tello
 faces charges of targeting children in countries across South America 
and Europe - including Peru, Argentina, Chile, Ukraine and Spain, and 
selling the videos he made of them across the world.

He is also accused of belonging to an international sex gang.

Police investigators claim he befriended his victims by using an email account where he posed as a schoolboy using the alias Maxi. He would then persuade his victims to take photos and videos in just their underwear.Â 

Tello would subsequently blackmail them into making videos of themselves naked and performing sex acts.

Most
 of the girls he allegedly targeted were aged six to 10. Spanish 
investigators said during a press conference in Lima, the Peruvian 
capital, that 14 minors in Spain had come forward to claim they had been
 blackmailed.

Police in Spain 
made the first breakthrough after discovering one of the videos in a 
private internet forum featuring a girl with a Gran Canaria school logo 
on her shirt.

They tipped off colleagues in Peru after
 identifying the girl and obtaining Tello's details from an email 
created in Argentina which his victim gave them.

Detectives
 seized more than 200 videos during a search of his home in Lima along 
with other material they believe could lead them to more victims.

Tello tried to hide a hard disk 
containing the pornographic material as officers burst into his property
 - but they discovered them concealed in a hole in the wall behind his 
bed.

Spanish police chief 
Ignacio Coslido said: 'This has been an arduous investigation which has 
led to the imprisonment of a depraved individual who preyed on the most 
defenceless and vulnerable.'

Jose Maria Martins of the child protection division of Spain's Technological Investigation Brigade, said: 'The
 most important thing is that we have removed the most prolific sexual 
predator we have ever encountered in the Spanish-speaking world.'

Gen Cesar Cortijo of the Peruvian police, said: 'We are still investigating the totality of the children involved.'

Promoting or selling child pornography in Peru carries an eight year prison sentence.
