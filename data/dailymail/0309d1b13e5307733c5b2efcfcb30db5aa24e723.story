Today, President Obama named Dartmouth president Jim Yong Kim as the White House’s nominee to lead the World Bank, thought by some to be an unconventional pick.

Mr Obama said Dr Kim, a Korean-born physician and pioneer in the treatment of HIV, AIDS and tuberculosis, has the breadth of experience on development issues needed to carry out the financial institution's anti-poverty mission.

But despite the seriousness of the role, Dr Kim is well known at the New Hampshire Ivy League school for his sense of humour. Only last year, he debuted as a rapping spaceman for the school’s annual talent show.

In the video, Dr Kim offers a nod to the Black Eyed Peas in a futuristic rendition of Time Of My Life from the movie Dirty Dancing. 

He is seen alongside Dartmouth students rapping, singing, and wearing a space-age getup of a white leather jacket and green glow sticks.

But despite the bouts of silliness, Dr Kim has an impressive resume – including an MD from Harvard Medical School and  a PhD in anthropology, also from Harvard, and received the coveted MacArthur grant in 2003.

Mr Obama, speaking from the White House, acknowledged Dr Kim’s credentials: 'It is time for a development professional to lead the world's largest development agency.' 

He was flanked by Dr Kim, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, Angola, Nigeria and South Africa have endorsed the nomination of Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a respected economist and diplomat, as a candidate to take over the bank when Robert Zoellick steps down in June.

'The endorsement is in line with the belief that the appointment of the leadership of the World Bank and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, should be merit-based, open and transparent,' the three said in a statement.

It was a rare example of unity among countries often at loggerheads as they strive for dominance on the continent.

A spokeswoman for U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs said he was withdrawing his nomination in support of Dr Kim.

'Professor Sachs supports Dr Kim 100 per cent and with complete enthusiasm,' spokeswoman Erin Trowbridge said.

The United States has held the presidency since the bank's inception after World War II, and a European has always headed the IMF.

Brazil would like to nominate former Colombian finance minister Jose Antonio Ocampo, but said it cannot do so without Colombia's support, which now looks unlikely.

While Mr Ocampo had agreed to stand and Brazil was willing to nominate him, Colombian Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said on Thursday his country was instead focusing on a bid for the presidency of the International Labour Organization.

He said that effort had a greater chance of success than going for the World Bank job because Colombia already held the top post at the Inter-American Development Bank.

Russia, a member of the so-called BRICs caucus of large emerging market economies, has refrained from publicly backing a non-U.S. candidate and instead called for a greater role for them in top management at international financial institutions.

Although the World Bank board would like to reach a consensus, Washington retains the largest single voting share and could expect the support of European nations and Japan, the bank's second-largest voting member.
