Teachers preparing for the first day of classes at a Texas school got an early morning surprise in the form of an alligator at the back door.

Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office deputies were called out to capture the animal Wednesday at Beck Junior High.

An employee alerted authorities that the seven-foot alligator was outside so they could remove it before students return campus.

Authorities found the reptile across campus near some air conditioning units.

'One of our deputies is kind of a veteran at doing this type of thing,' Bob Haenel of the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office told ABC.

'After several attempts of trying to rope the alligator, he managed to put a towel over the gator’s head to calm him down and then roped him.'

It was lassoed and removed after a brief struggle.

The alligator was taken to a 'more natural habitat' than the school yard.

No injuries were reported.

'Somebody thinks today is the first day of school! At @katyisd BeckJH,' Fort Bend Sheriff's Department posted on its Twitter account with a picture of the cornered alligator.

The school district says classes are still scheduled to begin on August 25.
