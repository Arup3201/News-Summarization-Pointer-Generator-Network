Gerard Depardieu has been banned from driving for six months and fined 4,000 Euros for drink driving.

The ban follows an incident in November last year when the actor, 64, fell off his scooter and was taken to a police station drunk.

Depardieu's lawyer, Eric de Caumont, 
said he planned to appeal Friday's ruling. He said his client, who was 
not at the hearing, was in Moscow filming.

Ban: Gerard Depardieu, pictured at the Russian Film Festival earlier this week, has been disqualified from driving for six months

Fall: The French actor slightly injured his elbow after falling off his scooter drunk in November last year

The Frenchman has publicly feuded 
with France's Socialist government over high taxes and has accepted a 
Russian passport offered by Vladimir Putin.

He was pictured leaving a police 
station in Paris the morning after his scooter incident, in which he 
slightly injured his elbow, last autumn.

Dressed in a sleeveless white shirt, 
the actor was well enough to jump back onto the vehicle and drive 
himself home following the overnight stay.

In trouble again: The
 Green Card star tested positive for alcohol after the incident

Agence France-Presse reported that 
when police arrived at the scene and tested Depardieu, he showed a blood 
alcohol level of 1.8 grams per litre, well above the French limit for 
driving of 0.5.

He was detained and brought to a police station where he could face 
misdemeanour charges 'after a period of sobering up,' the source told 
the French news agency.

In 1998 the actor was involved in a motorcycle crash when his blood-alcohol level was five times over the legal limit. He escaped with leg and face injuries.

And it's not the first motor incident for the beloved French star this year.

Hurt elbow: According to reports, the actor didn't suffer any major injuries

One
 of France's best-known actors for roles in more than a hundred films, 
Depardieu recently grabbed headlines again for the wrong reasons.

A car driver filed a legal complaint for assault and 
battery against Depardieu following an altercation in Paris after an 
alleged collision involving the actor's scooter and a car in the capital's Sixth
 
Arrondissement, near the Saint Sulpice Church.

The unnamed motorist claimed the 64-year-old punched him in the face, leaving him injured.

Feud: Depardieu has shown his public disapproval with high taxes brought in by France's Socialist government by moving to Russia after he was offered a passport by Russian president Vladimir Putin

An official from the prosecutor's officer said: 'There was a confrontation and the driver filed a complaint.'

Previously Depardieu made 
headlines after he was banned from an Air France flight for urinating in
 the aisle as it prepared to take off, forcing the plane to turn back to
 its parking spot.

A 
passenger on the flight said Depardieu appeared to be drunk and insisted
 he be allowed to use the bathroom during takeoff, when passengers must 
remain seated.
