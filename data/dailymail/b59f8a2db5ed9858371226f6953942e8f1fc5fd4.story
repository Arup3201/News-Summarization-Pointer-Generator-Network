Gays and lesbians who adopt children are ‘recruiting’ them to their cause claims evangelist Franklin Graham in his latest outspoken remarks about homosexuality.

Graham caused controversy last week when he praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for protecting children from gay 'propaganda' in a column in the March edition of Decision magazine.

In an interview published on YouTube on Tuesday Graham said - rather inaccurately – that gays and lesbians can’t have children.

Evangelist Franklin Graham has spoken out again against homosexuals and said that those that adopt children are trying to 'recruit' them to join their lifestyle

‘Of course, gays and lesbians cannot have children,’ he told the Charlotte Observer.

When it was pointed out that homosexual couples can adopt children, Graham responded: ‘They can recruit. You can adopt a child into a marriage, but you can also recruit children into your cause.

'I believe in protecting children from exploitation – all exploitations.’

Graham, who is the son of famous evangelical Christian evangelist Billy Graham, claimed he was only saying what his father would say if he were a younger man and in better health.

‘You talk about controversy – my father stood with Martin Luther King in the early 1960s,’ Graham said.

‘My father never worried about polls. I don’t care about them, either. And with the issues we are facing today – if my father were a younger man, he would be addressing and speaking out in the exact same way I’m speaking out on them.’

Billy Graham is bedridden at his Montreat home after taking ill following his 95th birthday party last November. 'He’s very, very weak,' said Graham.

Franklin Graham has been accused by his critics of steering the Charlotte-based Billy Graham Evangelistic Association away from his father's later-in-life emphasis on a loving God towards a conservative political agenda.

In his column in Decision magazine, Graham praises Putin as better than President Obama whose embrace of gay rights he said was 'shameful.'

'In my opinion, Putin is right on these issues,' Graham wrote. 'Obviously, he may be wrong about many things, but he has taken a stand to protect his nation's children from the damaging effects of any gay and lesbian agenda.

'Our president,' he continued, 'and his attorney general have turned their backs on God and His standards, and many in the Congress are following the administration's lead. This is shameful.'

Putin was widely criticized by gay rights activists for persecuting homosexuals in his country in the days leading up to the Winter Olympics.

Obama even included openly gay athletes in the U.S. delegation to Sochi in response. 

While Graham hedged his bets by noting that 'I am not endorsing President Putin,' he still praised his treatment of homosexuals as a deviant, outright dangerous group.

'Isn't it sad, though, that America's own morality has fallen so far that on this issues -- protecting children from any homosexual agenda or propaganda -- Russia's standard is higher than our own?'

Graham also took sides in the ongoing civil war in Syria, backing the macho Russian leader's interests as an ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

'Syria,  for all 
its problems, at least has a constitution that guarantees equal 
protection of citizens,' Graham wrote.

'Around the world, we have seen 
that this is essential where Christians are a minority and are not 
protected. …Christians in Syria know that if the radicals overthrow 
Assad, there will be widespread persecution and wholesale slaughter of 
Christians.'

Hard heart: Putin has been criticized for denying homosexuals basic human rights

Graham's father, evangelist Billy Graham, once called communism a 'religion that is inspired, directed, and motivated by the Devil himself who has declared war against Almighty God.'

However he softened his fire-and-brimstone critique in his later years.

'If I had it to do over again, I would avoid any semblance of involvement in partisan politics,' he wrote in his 1997 autobiography, 'Just As I am.'

Franklin Graham's comments have even angered some religious leaders who note that some gay Russians have been beaten, stabbed, and even killed.

'It's really disturbing when a religious leader seems to endorse laws that lead to this kind of behavior,' Marianne Duddy-Burke, head of the gay Catholic group DignityUSA, to the Huffington Post.

Franklin Graham hopes that his family's time in Russia long ago may have influenced a young Putin while the future president was an agent for the KGB in 1982.

'In fact, he was in charge
 of monitoring foreigners in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) when my 
father preached there in 1984,' Franklin Graham. 'If he was 
eavesdropping on our meeting, which I hope he was, he heard the Gospel!'
