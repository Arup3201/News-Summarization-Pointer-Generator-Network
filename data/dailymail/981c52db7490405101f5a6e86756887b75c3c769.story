Rekindling the flame? Patrick Schwarzenegger was spotted hanging out with ex girlfriend Taylor Burns in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico on Sunday

She's got his back: The 21-year-old American model had help applying sunscreen in a hard to reach area from his former flame

The friendly back rub on a shirtless Patrick came courtesy of a bikini clad Taylor Burns, who he reportedly dated for a year before his relationship with the Wrecking Ball singer.

Taylor made sure that the model and actor's upper back was well protected as she applied the cream while seemingly getting flirty with one another.

The former couple certainly still seem to have a tightly-knit relationship as they got touchy feely with one another as Patrick often placed his hand on her shoulder while they chatted it up within a rather close vicinity of one another.

She later even took the Grown-Ups 2 star's white basket-weaved fedora from on top of his head and placed it on hers before he grabbed it back.

Along with the hat, Patrick was dressed perfectly for an afternoon of partying at the at the Mango Deck Restaurant & Bar as he sported a pair of navy and white board shorts with sharks printed all over them.

Feeling still there?: Patrick definitely seemed to be getting a little flirtatious with the beauty

Touchy feely: The former couple appeared to spend plenty of time together

Still friendly: The two shared plenty of laughs together while his girlfriend Miley was back home

Familiar feelings: Patrick and Taylor appeared to be still quite comfortable with each other 

The fellow USC student and former flame was not the only one the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver was seen getting cosy with as he partied with a bevy of girls in their skimpy swimsuits during his university's spring break.

On the same day, he was pictured getting up close and personal with a mystery beauty dressed in a skimpy black bikini.

He later insisted on Twitter Monday that the girl he was caught cuddling with was just his best friend's girlfriend. 

Got your hat: Taylor swiped the actor's white basket-weaved fedora from atop his head

Flirty: The two giggled together as she kept the hat away from him

Give it back: Taylor pushed away his hand as he reached for the fedora

Shady: Patrick was able to get it back as he put the topper right back on

Patrick also maintained that he would never betray someone he's in a relationship with as he tweeted: 'Would NEVER do anything against my GF.....'

Lastly, he clarified that males and females can have platonic relationships: 'Girls have guy friends and guys have friends that are girls...' 

Miley has remained silent on the entire matter, but on Thursday night was partying up a storm in Texas and performing onstage while self-admittedly 'high' with Mike Will Made It at the SXSW Music Festival . 

Dynamic duo: The pair are both students at USC as the university celebrated it's spring break

Svelte: Taylor wore her blonde locks down flowing over her shoulders as she had natural, complimentary make-up on her face

Showing off: Patrick was shirtless as he donned a pair of blue and white Vilebrequin board shorts with sharks printed all over them

Good times: The two appeared to be having a great time partying it up at the Mango Deck Restaurant & Bar

Interestingly Miley, 22, and the music producer were previously rumoured to be romantically linked last summer, before she started dating Patrick, son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver.

A clearly inebriated Miley told the crowd last night: 'This is Texas. I don’t know how f***ing high you are, but we’re high as f**k up here.' 

While the Wrecking Ball singer has put on a strong front, she is said to be 'super bummed' about the pictures of Patrick getting close with a his female friend, according to People.com.

I think we're alone now: Later on in the day, the two appeared to opt for a bit more privacy

Up close and personal: The former couple seemed to have an intimate conversation

Partying down: Patrick interacted with several different  bikini-clad beauties during the outing

Former flame: Patrick and Taylor reportedly dated for a year as they were pictured together here in 2013

Miley shared snaps of her onstage antics from last night on Instagram, including another picture of herself sat in the backseat of a car with Mike.

She also uploaded a video of herself twerking in her hotel room and laughing, while appearing to be holding a joint in her hand.

Meanwhile, her dedicated fans have been supporting her on social media, however some have taken things too far and made death threats against Patrick.

Two can play at that game: Miley, meanwhile, made a surprise appearance at the SXSW Music Festival in Texas on Thursday night alongside producer Mike Will Made It, who she was romantically linked to last year 

The show goes on: The singer put on a surprise performance with the music producer and Patrick was noticeably absent

Shaking it: Before her performance Miley shared a video of herself twerking in her hotel roo

According to TMZ, some of the messages from her fans - collectively known as the Smilers - bordered on the dangerous and extreme.

'You better run for your life when you come to LA,' one angered fan wrote.

Another added: 'I hope your pizza place burns down,' while a separate troll posed the question, 'Who's gonna kill Patrick for us?'. 

Intimate embrace: Patrick was spotted looking very cosy with this bikini-clad woman, who is apparently called Natalie and who he claims is his best friend's girlfriend, on Sunday in Mexico

Another sought humour in the circumstance, joking that they would 'kill Patrick' if he went astray on his famous girlfriend of five months.

On Monday, after images were published of Patrick doing a shot off a bikini-clad girl's tummy, he took to social media and insisted it was just a friend.

He wrote: 'Omg. It's one of my best friends girlfriend... Would NEVER do anything against my GF.....Girls have guy friends and guys have friends that are girls...'

Early days of romance: The Wrecking Ball hit-maker has been dating the 21-year-old for around five months. They are pictured here in February
