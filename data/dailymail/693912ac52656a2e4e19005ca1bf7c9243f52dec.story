Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is in a state of disbelief as he comes to terms with his late World Cup call-up.

France coach Didier Deschamps summoned Schneiderlin, along with Montpellier winger Remy Cabella, to fill the void left in his squad by injuries to Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery and Lyon midfielder Clement Grenier.

While Ribery described his absence as 'like a death in the soul', for Schneiderlin it is a dream come true - but he admits he almost did not pick up the telephone to Deschamps on Thursday.

'I didn't answer the call to start with because I did not recognise the number,' the uncapped 24-year-old told L'Equipe.

Once Deschamps made contact, though, he had exciting news for Schneiderlin.

'He told me two players were injured so I needed to be ready, and that he would contact me the next day to tell me if I must come,' said the Saints player.

'After that call, I needed a bit of time before I could sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about what would happen the next day.'He did not promise me anything, just that I needed to be ready. It was certainly not the easiest night I have had.

'Then Friday, he called me and told me I needed to come. It was an incredible day.

'I can't believe it - everything has happened so quickly.'

Schneiderlin will battle for a central midfield place with Paul Pogba, Yohan Cabaye, Blaise Matuidi, Rio Mavuba and Moussa Sissoko, while Cabella joins Mathieu Valbuena and Antoine Griezmann in providing wing options.

The 24-year-old Cabella could reportedly be sold by Montpellier this summer as the club seek funds to rebuild their squad, with reported interest from Premier League sides Manchester United, Chelsea and Newcastle and Bundesliga pair Borussia Dortmund and Borussia Monchengladbach.

A successful tournament would enhance his profile and raise the financial rewards of any transfer and he told fff.fr: 'I am very happy to return to the France team.

'Going to the World Cup is an enormous thing and I hope I can can make the most of it.'
