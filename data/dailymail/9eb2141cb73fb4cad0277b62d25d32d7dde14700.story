It was only a matter of time - welcome to New York's first e-cigarette bar.

The Henley Vaporium has just opened up among the pop-up galleries and boutiques on the border of NoLita and SOHO and is being hailed the 'hookah bar of the now'.

Owner Talia Eisenberg even went as far to say she wants the space to become 'like Starbucks'.

So what exactly is an e-cigarette bar?

According to Eisenberg - a reformed smoker who, like many, turned to electronic cigarettes to kick her habit - it is both a shop that aims to help smokers (or 'vapers', as e-cigarette users have come to be known) find the perfect device for them, as well as a hang-out where you can 'vape', drink cold-pressed juices and eat from a vegan menu.

Just opened: The Henley Vaporium, an e-cigarette bar, is the first of its kind in New York, offering a place for 'vapers' - e-cigarette smokers - to hang out and sample new devices and flavors available

Oh-so-chic: The Henley Vaporium is located at 23 Cleveland Pl in NoLita, right near the SOHO border

Candy store of e-cigs: There seems no end to the flavors of vaper available, from cherry to 'Mr Miyagi'. There is a patio out back and a coffee bar

Eisenberg developed Henley, a company that purveys e-cigarettes, after being unimpressed by the e-cigarettes available at the time.

'(They') didn't have the throat hit of a real cigarette,' she told The Week.

Now the Henley Vaporium is her first real store and the first e-cigarette bar of its kind.

They are like-minded spots in Washington and California.

While the medical community continue to debate the heath effects of e-cigs, the consensus is they are much better for you than regular cigarettes.

While e-cigarettes still administer a hit of nicotine - the amount of which you can test and buy at the Vaporium - they are without the tabacco and chemicals contained in regular cigarettes.

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, smokers recieve some 7,000 chemicals from each cigarette.

'We have 30-year smokers who have switched over and are suddenly running again,' Eisenberg says. 

'I feel like I'm doing something good for the world when that happens.' 

Try before you buy: Some of the flavors available, known as 'e-juice', which is inserted in the e-cigarette to flavor the vapor they produce

Henley founder Talia Eisenberg developed her own e-cigarette after being dissatisfied with what was available on the market two years ago, when e-cigarettes were relatively new. E-cigarettes have since been outlawed on all US flights

Original: Henley started with standard cigarette-style offerings before expanding into flavors

Strength: 24mg is the most nicotine on offer

Vaporium staffer Michael, whose title is officially 'vapologist', guides patrons through the flavor and device pairings.

'It's product knowledge - knowing how much of what flavor to vape,' he said.

'We want to show people this is cool. We're the hookah bar of the now.'

The Henley Vaporium features a red floor, disco balls and mismatched vintage furniture.

Although it is being called a bar, there is no alcohol available because it doesn't fit with the 'health' theme.

The headlining feature however are the available flavors of vaper, known as 'e-juice'.

They start predictably with watermelon and vanilla and go to the crazy like Jamaican Me Crazy, Nutty Buddy, Happy Ending.
