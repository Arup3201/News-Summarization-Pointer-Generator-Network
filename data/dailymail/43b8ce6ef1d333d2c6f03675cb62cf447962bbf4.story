Gaming machine operators face a clampdown in an attempt to protect problem gamblers.

Their betting shop terminals are called the ‘crack cocaine’ of the high street because they allow punters to wager £100 a spin and as much as £18,000 an hour.

Don Foster, the Lib Dem communities minister, has campaigned for this to be cut to £2 a spin – in line with bingo halls and casinos.

David Cameron and Nick Clegg have now agreed to examine a reversal of Labour’s relaxation of gambling regulation.

Betting websites which operate from Caribbean islands such as Barbuda and Antigua will be forced to apply for UK licences.

Fixed odds terminals were introduced in 2002 and allow players to bet on roulette, poker and blackjack. The number of machines has soared to 32,000 from 16,380 in 2007.

Britons have become so addicted to them that at least £46billion is expected to be staked this year.

The Coalition’s all-powerful quad – Mr Cameron, Mr Clegg, George Osborne and Danny Alexander – has agreed to reject a call from the Commons culture committee for there to be fewer restrictions on the machines.

Instead, it has ordered a review of stakes, numbers of machines and prize levels. Councils may also be given powers to curb the terminals.

‘For too long, this problem has been swept under the carpet,’ said Mr Foster. ‘There’s no doubt this is ruining people’s lives. Fixed odds betting terminals have incredibly high stakes and prizes. People chase their losses. These machines are getting more and more sophisticated.

‘From telephone calls to gambling helplines, we do know that increasingly these machines are being used by large numbers of people who are saying they are getting into difficulty and need help.’

He told the Daily Mail that young and unemployed men were the most regular players.

‘There are very many in the industry themselves who have concerns about it, though they are very reluctant to say much about it because they are worried about the impact it might have on other parts of the industry,’ he added. ‘Some bookmakers’ shops are now making as much as 70 to 80 per cent of their takings from the machines.’

Mr Foster said the Labour Party had allowed the machines to spread but now admitted this was a mistake.

‘MPs from all parties have been expressing concern,’ he said. ‘As a result of that protest, I am delighted that I can tell you that the Government has agreed at the most senior level that we are now going to conduct a review into the evidence for the need to look again at the levels of stakes and prizes and other issues related to these fixed odds betting terminals.

‘We can look at the level of the stakes, we can look at the number of machines that are allowed, we can look at the spin rate.

'This is a real victory for all those, including the Daily Mail, that have expressed real concern about these machines, which frankly are an aberration.’

Mr Foster said he favoured a maximum stake of £2, but it would be up to the industry to make a case for higher amounts.

He also said the Government would shake up the regulation of offshore gaming websites, saying it was ‘crazy’ that many taking bets from British punters were registered so far away.

‘We intend to have some form of secondary licensing system where if you want to advertise and do business in this country then you have to have a UK imprimatur to ensure you are regulated here and are making a contribution to taxes here,’ he added.

Gareth Wallace, of the Salvation Army, said: ‘We warmly welcome that the Government is going to look at limits on the numbers of these machines and a reduction in the stakes. All the evidence is that they are far more addictive than other forms of gambling. Bringing regulation for websites onshore is also a good thing.’

In July, the culture committee called for a relaxation of ‘puritanical’ gambling laws. It said councils should approve the creation of more casinos, which should be permitted to provide up to 20 high stakes gambling machines.
