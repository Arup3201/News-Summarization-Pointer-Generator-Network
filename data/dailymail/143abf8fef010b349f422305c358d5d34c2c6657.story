Adolf Hitler’s personal address book for Munich that lists him as a writer has emerged for sale.

The document comes with the original receipt dated December 19, 1931 and the Nazi leader has also signed and dated it.

Also loosely inserted is a printed circular letter, addressed in typescript to Hitler, offering various different versions of the book.

In the 1932 directory Hitler is listed on page 413 as ‘schriftsteller’ - writer - because of the publication of his book Mein Kampf, My Struggle.

That book is partly autobiographical and partly ideology, started by Hitler when he was in prison for what he considered to be political crimes after his failed Putsch, or coup, in Munich in November 1923.

Mein Kampf was published two years later. Then he started to build a network of contacts around him for his next attempt to gain control of Germany.

His address, in the contacts book, is listed as 16,2 Prinzregentplatz and the directory came from the personal collection of Hitler’s housekeeper, Annie Brunner.

The book was important, as 
the Nazi party expanded its membership base in the early Thirties - all part of Hitler's plan to take control of the country.

His office was at the National Socialist Party's HQ, The Brown House in Munich, named after the colour of the party uniforms.

Also at the Brown House were Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Göring, Rudolf Hess.

It was, however, damaged in October 1943 and largely 
destroyed in an allied bombing raid late in World War II. The rubble was
 cleared away in 1947, leaving an empty lot.

Hitler committed suicide in his Berlin bunker by gunshot on 30 April 1945. His wife Eva Braun also killed herself with him by ingesting cyanide.

The Munich address book was part of a collection given by Hitler to his housekeeper Annie that the German government tried to obtain for the State.

Annie fought to retain it and won a legal battle. It has since passed down to a private German collector who is now selling it.

The document is expected to make up to £5,000 when it goes under the hammer at a Richard Westwood-Brookes sale in association with Mullock’s auction house in Ludlow, Shropshire.

Mr Westwood-Brookes said: 'This is a unique document that was owned by Hitler when he lived in Munich in 1931.

'In it are several letters from the publishers and it also contains Hitler’s signature.

'It is a valuable historical item that lists Hitler as a writer because of the release of Mein Kampf.

'The book was a best seller and gave its author a decent income and during the year he bought the directory the Nazis were growing quickly and were the second largest party in Germany.

'While Hitler lived at the address given in the directory, the Nazi HQ was the Brown House in Munich.

'I’m sure there will be a great deal of interest in this fascinating historical document.'
