A convicted murderer given the lethal injection despite emotional pleas worldwide for his life is being remembered this weekend as a gentle man who faced his execution with grace and dignity.

Sent to death row 20 years ago, Troy Davis was celebrated as 'martyr and foot soldier' by more than 1,000 people who packed the pews at his funeral on Saturday and pledged to fight the death penalty.

Davis, 42, was executed last month in Georgia for the slaying of off-duty police officer Mark MacPhail in 1989, insisting his innocence and asking forgiveness for his accusers and executioners.

'Troy's last words that night were he told us to keep fighting until his name is cleared in Georgia,' Mr Jealous said at the funeral on Saturday at Jonesville Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia.

'But most important, keep fighting until the death penalty is abolished and this can never be done to anyone else.'

Davis's closed casket was piled with a
spray of blue and white flowers - a colour scheme decoded by a close 
friend who mentioned his love of NFL team the Dallas Cowboys.

Attendees each got a glossy, 22-page 
programme filled with a scrapbook's worth of photos, many of Davis in 
his white prison garb posing with family members during weekend visits.

Last night more than 250 people, 
including civil rights activists Benjamin Jealous and Dick Gregory, 
jammed the New Life Apostolic Temple in Davis’s hometown of Savannah.

This church memorial served as a prelude to a much larger service for Davis's funeral today, where a line of people waited outside the Jonesville Baptist Church before it started this morning.

Dead: Troy Davis, 42, was executed in Georgia

On Friday, friends, pastors, anti-death penalty activists and Davis' lawyer all took turns at a podium behind his closed casket, decorated with a spray of white and purple flowers.

Longtime friend Earl Redman, who said he had known Davis since the age of eight, told the crowd on Friday that during prison visits Davis would often say that he expected to die in the death chamber.

‘He looked me in the eye and he told me: “Don't let me die in vain. Don't let my name die in vain”,’ Mr Redman said as a church usher tore paper towels off a roll for teary attendees to dry their eyes.

The Reverend Randy Loney, a Macon pastor who often visited Davis in prison, said he was always struck by Davis's gentle nature despite the death sentence looming over him.

Referring to the catchphrase adopted by his supporters - ‘I am Troy Davis’ - Reverend Loney said he came to realise that ‘in a lot of ways, we are not Troy Davis’.

‘We did not wake up every morning and go to sleep every evening with the spectre of the executioner in our eyes,’ Reverend Loney said.

Jason Ewart, a lawyer who spent seven years handling Davis's appeals, fought back tears as he recalled sitting with execution witnesses and watching the life drain from his client's eyes.

Mr Ewart recalled many long phone conversations with Davis, never shorter than an hour, in which the men spent twice as much time talking about their families as they did legal strategy.

Mr Ewart said his own grandmother had just died, and he pictured her and Davis together at ‘heaven orientation’.

‘She would say: “Jesus died on the cross not because he was guilty, but because we all were”,’ Mr Ewart said.

Davis's family opted to open the funeral on Saturday to his supporters and the general public, holding the service at a church that organisers say can seat 2,000 people.

The pastor delivering the eulogy said he hopes the funeral will serve as wake-up call on the death penalty much like the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till shocked Americans to the brutality of Jim Crow.

‘Emmett Till's mother insisted on
an open casket funeral in a way that the world could see the injustice 
of Jim Crow,' Revd Raphael Warnock of 
Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, said on Friday.

'He looked me in the eye and he told me: “Don't let me die in vain. Don't let my name die in vain”'

'It's much to the Davis family's credit that they have been 
willing in the midst of their personal pain to see that we are talking 
about a larger, national moral crisis.'

Till
was killed and his body was mutilated by white men after the boy was 
seen speaking to a white woman at a grocery store in the Mississippi 
Delta in August 1955.

His death was an early flashpoint that helped spark the civil rights movement.

Trying their best: Demostrators attempted to continue the fight last month to keep Davis alive

Reverend
Warnock, head pastor at the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr 
once preached, said ‘it's not a perfect analogy’ to compare Davis' case 
to the Till lynching.

'In a lot of ways, we are not Troy Davis. We did not wake up every morning and go to sleep every evening with the spectre of the executioner in our eyes'

Reverend Randy Loney

Davis was convicted in 1991 of killing Mr MacPhail, who was shot twice while rushing to stop an attack on a homeless man.

After
four years of appeals since Davis' first scheduled execution was halted
in 2007, every court that looked at Davis' case ultimately upheld his 
death sentence.

Mr 
MacPhail's family and prosecutors insist Davis was the killer. But 
Reverend Warnock said he is among those who believe Davis was innocent.
