For American visitors, it is one of Britain's more common tourist traps - the struggle to pronounce place names such as Leicester Square, Worcester and Edinburgh.

Now a new Google invention hopes to help those struggling by offering audio examples of names of commonly mispronounced sites, based purely on recordings of they are spoken locally.

The newly-patented technology by the web giant could be implanted into Google Maps, saving future tourists the embarrassment of tripping over the name of Britain's commonly mis-stated landmarks.

Google's guide will ask locals to record place names to find out the most common way.

If it comes to fruition, multiple recordings of how locals say a particular word would be submitted and uploaded to a server.

From there, Google would assess the recordings to attach the word's most common pronunciation to the place name on Google Maps.

This function could be handy, as Google says in the patent, 'when traveling in a foreign country.'

'Systems and methods are provided to select a most typical pronunciation of a location name on a map from a plurality of user pronunciations,' the application says.

'A server generates a reference speech model based on user pronunciations, compares the user pronunciations with the speech model and selects a pronunciation based on comparison.'

'Alternatively, the server compares the distance between one the user pronunciations and every other user pronunciations and selects a pronunciation based on comparison. 

Google could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals.

This could then be used to find the most common pronunciation.

Software could then find the most common recorded file, and play it to users when someone searches for the place on Google Maps.

'The server then annotates the map with the selected pronunciation and provides the audio output of the location name to a user device upon a user's request.' 

The place name used in the patent filing is Worcester  - the name of a city in the UK, and also of one in South Africa and ten places in the US—and it is pronounced slightly differently in each country.

Google said the patent doesn't necessarily mean that Google will be adding this functionality to its maps anytime soon: 'Some of those ideas later mature into real products or services, some don't,' a spokeswoman said. 

Google also recently officially launched speech translation as part of its Translate app.

Both iOS and Android users can now talk to the app and get a written translation of what they're saying, in real time, on the screen. 

The move builds on Google's current tools, which offer written translation of 90 languages, as well  spoken translations in a select number of languages on Android devices.

'Often the hardest part of travelling is navigating the local language,' said Barak Turovsky, product lead for Google Translate.

'Now Google Translate can be your guide in new ways. Asking for directions to the Rive Gauche, ordering bacalhau in Lisbon, or chatting with your grandmother in her native Spanish just got a lot faster.'
