Teachers at a Bradford comprehensive were suspended after clashing with governors who wanted to model the school on the academy at the centre of the ‘Trojan Horse’ allegations.

Staff at Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College are said to have objected to paying Tahir Alam to provide training to governors.

Mr Alam is chairman of governors at Park View Academy – one of five Birmingham schools placed in  special measures by Ofsted this week for failing to protect pupils from extremism.

He has been accused of being the ‘ringleader’ of an alleged plot to oust head teachers and force through a strict Islamic agenda.

After visiting a series of schools in Birmingham, Ofsted is now widening its probe to other areas including Bradford, Luton and east London. At Laisterdyke, where pupils are mainly Muslim, it is claimed governors have attempted to oust principal Jennifer McIntosh.

‘Over recent months there have been ongoing battles between the governors and Jennifer McIntosh which I have witnessed first-hand,’ an anonymous source at the school is reported saying.

‘The tactics used at the school are reminiscent of those employed in Operation Trojan Horse, with governors constantly questioning decisions, school results and vociferous complaints from the community.’

Faisal Khan, a former governor at Laisterdyke, told the Independent newspaper that some members of staff at Laisterdyke were suspended during his time there for ‘ignoring instructions from governors’. Mr Khan also said Mr Alam was paid to carry out governance training at the school and denied that there had been any dispute between the school leadership and governors over payment for the work.

Mr Khan insisted: ‘We [the governing body] were all removed for trying to hold the school to account.’  Mr Khan has been filmed describing how he and fellow governors worked ‘for a number of years’ to ‘change the head teacher’ at Bradford schools. He has described claims against him as a ‘witch-hunt’.

He and the rest of the governors were removed in April following a critical Ofsted report and concerns raised by the council. They were accused of undermining the head and interfering in the day-to-day running of the school.

Ofsted has also visited a second school in the city, Feversham  College, a state Muslim faith school for girls. At a third, Carlton Bolling College, leaked minutes of governors meetings suggest attempts to segregate boys and girls and narrow the curriculum.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, has asked Ofsted’s regional directors across the country to ‘respond swiftly to further concerns that are brought to their attention’. ‘What inspectors found in a number of schools in Birmingham is deeply disturbing,’ he said.

‘We should all be concerned if a school is failing to encourage children to develop tolerant attitudes towards other faiths and cultures or allowing governors to exert inappropriate influence on the curriculum or other aspects of school life.’
