The British economy will perform better than all its major European rivals this year as the sluggish recovery picks up pace, a leading global watchdog said yesterday.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast growth of 0.8 per cent in the UK in 2013 – slightly weaker than the 0.9 per cent previously expected.

But it slashed its forecast for the eurozone from a decline of 0.1 per cent to a reverse of 0.6 per cent – with Britain doing better than Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

Recovery: The UK economy will grow by just 0.8 per cent, the OECD predicts as it urged investment in infrastructure to secure growth

Pier Carlo Padoan, the group’s chief 
economist, said: ‘The British economy is recovering slowly and that 
reflects the fact that Europe is doing poorly. Growth is expected to 
pick up gradually through 2013 and 2014.’

The Paris-based think tank said 
Chancellor George Osborne’s austerity plans were ‘appropriate’ and 
‘necessary’ and added that the outlook in the UK was far brighter than 
on the Continent, where the situation is ‘dire’.

But, in its twice-yearly Economic 
Outlook report, it said ‘much more needs to be done’ to repair Britain’s
battered finances and bolster growth.

The OECD called for increased 
spending on infrastructure projects such as housing and transport to 
help the UK overcome the ‘strong headwinds’ buffeting the economy.

‘Continuing to shift the composition 
of public expenditure in favour of infrastructure investment would 
enhance growth prospects,’ said the organisation, which cast doubt over 
the decision to protect large parts of public spending from cuts, such 
as the NHS, education and overseas aid.

Jorgen Elmeskov, its deputy chief 
economist, said: ‘We are perhaps somewhat doubtful [as] to the idea of 
ring-fencing certain spending areas. That tends to lead to deeper cuts 
in other areas which may not be warranted.

‘You may or may not want to cut down 
less on health than on other areas, but that should be a result of an 
assessment of the costs and benefits of doing it, not because you carve 
out health and thereby impose bigger adjustments on other expenditure 
items.’

But the report from the OECD, which 
represents around 30 of the world’s biggest economies, will come as a 
relief to Mr Osborne as the austerity debate rages on.

The International Monetary Fund last week called on the Chancellor to loosen the purse strings this year to bolster growth.

But the OECD said further cuts are 
‘necessary to store the sustainability of public finances’. It warned 
that prolonged weakness in the eurozone ‘could evolve into stagnation 
with negative implications for the global economy’.

Growth forecasts in Germany were cut 
from 0.6 per cent to 0.4 per cent while the OECD now expects the French 
economy to shrink by 0.3 per cent instead of expand by 0.3 per cent.

Spain and Italy are set to fare even worse.

Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the
European Commission, admitted that governments need to ‘do more to help
themselves get back to growth and move Europe beyond the crisis’. He 
added: ‘There is no room for complacency.’

Mr Padoan said the pace of recovery 
around the world was ‘still disappointing’ but insisted that ‘the global
economy is moving forward’. He called on the European Central Bank to 
combat the recession through measures such as a money-printing programme
dubbed quantitative easing or QE.

‘Europe is in a dire situation,’ he 
said. ‘The eurozone could consider more aggressive options. We could 
call it a eurozone-style QE.’

The OECD said rising unemployment ‘is the most pressing challenge’ facing the region.
