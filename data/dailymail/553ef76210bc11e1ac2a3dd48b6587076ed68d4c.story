'Calculating': Bhupinder Dhesi tried to have his mother-in-law killed after his wife left him

An abusive husband has been jailed for plotting with an undercover policeman to have his mother-in-law killed.

Bhupinder Dhesi, from Gravesend, Kent, had earlier suggested he would like 'an accident' to happen to his estranged wife, Maidstone Crown Court heard.

But a week later he decided her mother should die instead, and then arranged to give an officer £12,000 if he murdered Parminder Kaur Sandhu.

Dhesi, 36, originally made his sinister suggestion to a private investigator - who he had hired to help him find his wife Sanjeet and their two children.

His requests soon turned strange, however, as the 'cold and calculating' man asked investigator Tony Gaskin to find him two witnesses to give false evidence in his mortgage fraud court case.

The investigator, who was uneasy with the request, asked Dhesi to email him his requirements, and went on to contact the police.

Dhesi then said in a recorded conversation played in court that he wanted his mother-in-law killed, because she was standing in the way of him getting his wife and children back.

Detectives arrested him 
at his home on October 13 last year - days before he was due to stand 
trial at Maidstone Crown Court on two fraud charges.

Sentencing Dhesi to 11 years in jail yesterday, Judge Jeremy Carey said: 'The facts reveal a very grave state of affairs.

'To say this was an extreme response is a substantial understatement.'

Dhesi, who has a history of domestic violence, contacted Mr Gaskin in September last year and asked to help him get in touch with his wife, as he was banned from contacting her under a non-molestation order.

She had moved back in with her parents and he blamed his mother-in-law for keeping her away from him.

He then said he wanted Mrs Sandhu 'hurt'.

When asked how badly, he replied: 'Very, very, very.'

Asked if they were talking dead or alive, he responded: 'The first one you said.'

He later showed the officer a picture of Mrs Sandhu on his mobile phone and said he wanted her 'put away.'

The officer asked: 'Are we talking dead?' and Dhesi replied: 'Yeah.'

A fee of £10-12,000 was agreed, with a
£1,000 deposit. But Dhesi cancelled the next meeting, saying he had not
raised the £1,000.

Deepak Kapur, prosecuting, told the court: 'He referred to the fact that Parminder Sandhu had a hold on the family.'

Dhesi admitted soliciting to murder, perverting the course of justice and three mortgage fraud offences involving £650,000.

Following the case, Detective Chief 
Inspector Andrea Bishop, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime 
Directorate, said: 'Dhesi was cold and calculating and prepared to go to
any length to get his wife and children back.

'It didn't matter to 
him if that cost money or meant getting people to lie on his behalf. He 
is now behind bars for a long time where he will have time to reflect 
upon his actions.'
