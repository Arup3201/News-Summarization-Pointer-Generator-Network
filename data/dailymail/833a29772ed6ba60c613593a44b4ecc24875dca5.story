Embarrassing: When Hugh Robertson, pictured, tried to get into London 2012's new media centre without the necessary pass, he fell at the first hurdle

He might be the minister for the Olympics, but he’s hardly a household name.

So when Hugh Robertson tried to get into London 2012’s new media centre without the necessary pass, he fell at the first hurdle.

Failing to recognise the former Army major, the security men on duty correctly refused to let him into the multi-million pound venue.

But their professionalism did not go down well with the Tory MP. ‘I’m the Olympics minister. You should damn well know who I am,’ he snorted.

Faced with blank looks from the guards, the usually mild-mannered Tory MP is then alleged to have become ‘very angry’ – a claim flatly denied by Mr Robertson’s spokesman.

A ten minute stand-off followed before someone inside the building vouched for the minister and he was finally allowed in.

Afterwards a security officer recalled how  the MP had snapped at him: ‘He said, “I’m the Olympics minister. You should damn well know who I am”.

‘I didn’t have a clue who he was and we have to check everyone’s identification whoever they are.

‘He should know that better than anyone else.’

A second guard added: ‘He said “I’m on the television all the time”, but I had never seen him before. I think it was out of order.’

The guards complained to supervisors, but were told by press officers to let the former soldier inside so that he could address waiting journalists.

A source at the London Organising Committee of the Olympics and Paralympics said Mr Robertson was ‘not happy’ when he was finally allowed into the building.

Last night, a spokesman for the 
Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said: ‘The minister had a 
cordial conversation with one of the security team to get a pass for a 
media briefing that was beginning shortly.

‘It is day one of the main Press centre being opened and we are encouraged that thorough security checks are being carried out.’

Mr Robertson, MP for Faversham and Mid Kent, was at the opening of the media centre on the same day that giant Olympic rings were unveiled on Tower Bridge to mark one month until the start of the Games.

But critics questioned the £1million price tag that came with the installation.

The rings cost £500,000 to design, 
construct and maintain, but will be replaced in seven weeks to make way 
for the Paralympic logo, which will also cost £500,000.

Under International Olympic Committee 
guidelines, the five rings will be replaced by the ‘three agitos’ symbol
shortly after the Olympics closing ceremony.

Yesterday, London mayor Boris Johnson said: ‘Glorious Tower Bridge is recognised the world over and, adorned with the famous Olympic rings, it is the perfect choice to showcase what London has to offer this summer.’

But The Taxpayers’ Alliance said it was yet another expense, on top of the £9.3billion investment from the public purse.

Campaign manager Robert Oxley said: ‘Tower Bridge might provide a pretty photo-piece but taxpayers will rightly ask at what point organisers are going to stop spending their money and show even an ounce of restraint.’

Last night, a light show at Tower Bridge showed off the Yorkshire-made 13-ton rings to their full effect.
