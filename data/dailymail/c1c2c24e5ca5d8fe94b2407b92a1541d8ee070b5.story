One of Bill Cosby's accusers has hit out at his family's claims that the comedian is the victim of unfounded accusations and a 'wonderful husband'.

Yesterday Cosby's daughter Evin and his wife Camille  issued impassioned defences of the 77-year-old actor.

However, Barbara Bowman, who alleges Cosby was 'like an animal' when he assaulted her in 1987, has now responded with a message directed at Cosby's wife.

Bill Cosby has been fiercely defended by his wife of more than 50 years. Camille (pictured with Cosby on November 6) claims he is the victim of unfounded allegations 

Mrs Cosby has continued to stand by her husband in the past few months while more than a dozen women have come forward claiming he assaulted them.

Bowman said she could not imagine the 'torment, anguish and deep disappointment' Mrs Cosby would be experiencing, Access Hollywood reported.

She added: 'As she comes to terms with the raw reality of what her husband has caused as his partner of 50 years, she must be shedding tears for her family and for other families across this nation. Bill Cosby is not that man I thought I knew.'

Since Bowman went public with her allegation to MailOnline, more than a dozen other women have come forward with allegations that include claims Cosby spiked their drinks before taking advantage of them.

Bowman claimed she was 'drugged and raped' by him.

She said: 'He is a monster. He came at me like a monster. My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.'

Cosby has yet to be charged and the allegations against him, which date as far back as the 1960s, are too old for most criminal charges or civil complaints.

Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, has called allegations against the trailblazing African-American comedian 'discredited' and 'defamatory.'

Yesterday the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office announced he would not be charged in connection with a 1974 molestation claim,

Prosecutors concluded allegations that The Cosby Show star sexually molested a 15-year-old girl at the Playboy Mansion were too old and surpassed the state's statute of limitations for either a felony or misdemeanor charge.

'Given that 40 years have passed since the alleged incident, prosecution ... is declined due to the expiration of the statue of limitations,' the official charge evaluation document stated.
