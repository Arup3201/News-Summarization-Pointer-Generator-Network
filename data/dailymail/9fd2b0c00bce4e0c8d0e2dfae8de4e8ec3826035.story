A newspaper poll in Australia has revealed that more than two-thirds of people do not blame DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian for the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha.

More than 34,000 readers took part in the Sydney Daily Telegraph newspaper's poll, with 68 per cent saying the blame should not be apportioned to the radio presenters.

It comes as the Australian press accused the UK media of playing a 'blame game' in the wake of the incident.

2Day FM remained under siege today, with internet hoaxers setting up fake pages, and the hacking group Anonymous allegedly threatened the station's advertisers in a video posted on YouTube.

'Witch-hunt': The Australian press has accused the UK media of playing a 'blame game' following nurse Jacintha Saldanha's death. The nurse was duped by a hoax call from radio presenters Michael Christian, left, and Mel Greig, right

Headlines: Nurse Jacintha Saldanha's death made the front pages of most of Australia's main media players today

Mother-of-two Mrs Saldanha, 46 was
found dead on Friday in staff accommodation at the hospital where Kate,
30, had been treated for acute morning sickness.

She
was one of two nurses duped into believing that two 2Day FM presenters 
putting on accents were the Queen and Prince Phillip attempting to get 
an update on Kate's condition.

Her death made the front page 
of most of Australia's biggest papers, with much of the focus falling 
on Michael Christian and Mel Greig, the two young DJs at the eye of the 
storm.

The pair are said to be receiving counselling following Mrs Saldanha's death.

A copycat page pretending to be the radio station's real website has added to problems for the company.

The copycat, which is using the 
station's official logo, has outraged users by asking them to vote on 
whether they would commit suicide if they received a prank call.

'Comment if you would kill yourself if you got prank called and like if you wouldn't kill yourself,' said the bogus site.

Many
Australian media commentators were today defending the DJs at the 
centre of the controversial prank and accused the British media and 
members of the public who took to Twitter and Facebook to lambast the 
pair of 'witch hunt'.

The Sydney Morning Herald quoted a spokeswoman for Austereo as describing the backlash in the British media as 'ferocious'.

She said: 'Australia seems to be much more balanced. In the UK it's like they're on a witch-hunt.

'It's
intense and what's incredible to me is it's so much easier for the 
British media to have us as the target (than the hospital).'

Finger pointing: Many papers talked of a 'blame game' being played by UK media following the radio prank

Andrew Bolt wrote in the Herald Sun 
that Grieg and Christian could potentially face the same fate as 
Jacintha Saldanha as they seek 'intensive counselling' in the wake of 
the nurse's death.

He said: 'To be guilty of bad taste is
one thing but to be held guilty of manslaughter is a monstrously unfair
other, and makes the finger pointers seem hypocrites.

'Want to push more people over the edge? Keep on screaming "blood on their hands".'

Siobhan Duck of the same newspaper called for people not to point the finger of blame at Greig and Christian.

An
opinion piece written in a similar tone in the Australian Sunday 
Telegraph said: 'It is profoundly unfair to load responsibility for Ms 
Saldanha's death upon the shoulders of 2DayFM's young presenters.

'They could not have possibly known anything of the torment that clearly placed the mother of two at risk of self-harm.'

The
paper blamed the Leveson Inquiry and a heightened awareness of ethics 
among the British media as the reason behind the so-called 'blame game.'

An article stated that while 
accusations had been aimed at the hospital and its staff initially for 
falling for the prank, the 'tide turned like a tsunami with the guilt 
now aimed at the Sydney radio pair Mel Greig and Michael Christian' 
following Mrs Saldanha's death.

The
Telegraph also pointed out that the reasons for Mrs Saldanha's apparent
suicide are unclear despite her part in the radio prank.

An
article read: 'Mainstream media websites published thousands of 
comments directly blaming Greig and Christian for the death. 

'Both
responses are wildly out of proportion to the event. It is seductive, 
but too simple, to blame Ms Saldanha's death on a radio hoax.

'Suicide is a complex act and can rarely be entirely blamed on a lone event, however distressing.'

It was clear that many people were 
taken in by the fake site. 'I cannot believe the radio has the balls to 
post this message,' wrote one user.

'How dare them try and blame her 
death on something else. I hope your station gets shut down and you lose
all your advertiser,' wrote another person who was tricked by the fake 
site.

A YouTube user claiming to be part of
the internet activist group Anonymous made a threat aimed at the DJs 
and Rhys Holleran, chief executive officer of the company.

A computer-generated
voice accompanied a vision of the Anonymous group's signature Guy 
Fawkes mask.

It said: 'You are directly responsible for the
death of another human being, a woman who was dedicated to helping 
others, a mother who was loved, a respected member of the community who 
was turned into a joke by your radio station.

'We have studied the facts and found you guilty of murder.'

To add to the station's woes, shares in owners Southern Cross Media plunged by six per cent.

Blame: A video purported to be from the Anonymous group condemned the two DJs

Tributes: Flowers left outside the Nurse quarters to the King Edward VII hospital in London where Jacintha Saldanha died after recieving a prank phonecall from an Australian radio station

The Sydney Daily Telegraph paper charted the careers of the pair, in particular Michael Christian, who it described as a 'rising star' of Australian radio, whose life they said 'will never be the same again'.

According to the Telegraph, the pair had only just started working together when the prank call was made.

Jane Hansen of the Sunday Mail was particularly sympathetic to the young pair and cited a similar journalistic experience of her own which had a profound effect on her life and career.

She told how a story she ran on a television repairman charging customers for work not being carried out had killed himself following her piece.

She said: 'I'm not going to sit in judgement, nor do I want to sound like an apologist. But I will say that suicide leaves everyone gutted and searching around for answers.

'There is no way such a silly prank should lead to such a tragic outcome, but the radio duo will blame themselves - and there will be plenty of haters ready to fan such thoughts.'

The Sunday 
Telegraph's front page headline 'Shattered' described how a 'juvenile' 
prank had destroyed lives on both sides of the world. 

The story told how Greig and Christian are in hiding and both receiving counselling following the incident.

The same paper also featured the reaction of Kate Middleton's second cousin Lilian Lowers who moved to the remote New South Wales town of Gilgandra - ironically Michael Christian's home town - from Luton, Bedfordshire, in 1982 with her husband Ron.

She told the paper that her sympathies lay with Mrs Saldanha's family.

She said: 'It's absolutely shocking. There was no need to play that prank just for laughs. What a terrible thing to happen.

'I couldn't believe it.'

The Australian described the hoax 
call's consequences as a timely reminder of  the 'impact media in all 
its forms can have on an individual.'

One of Australia's biggest broadsheet dailies The Sydney Morning 
Herald told how radio station 2Day FM were in crisis talks after 
advertisers distanced themselves from the station and King Edward VII 
Hospital's chairman wrote a letter to station bosses.

The SMH reported that the DJ's have expressed a desire to speak to the press and publicly state their remorse.

The prank seems to have divided opinion in Australia.

More than 83,000 of the SMH's readers 
had taken part in a poll asking whether their opinion of the hoax call 
had changed in light of Mrs Saldanha's death.

Just 27 per cent of those polled said
that the prank was a joke and that its 'consequences were not 
intended.' 61 per cent said that they always found the joke 'in bad 
taste'.

One reader, named only as Daveywavey 
commented on the newspaper's website: 'What was ever supposed to be 
funny about trying to contact a sick, pregnant woman being treated in 
hospital in her first (and most dangerous) trimester when the status of 
the foetus was unknown?

'Even by Australian 'larrikin' standards, I'm not seeing the humour.'

But
many Australian's agreed with claims that there is a 'witch-hunt' 
against the two radio presenters at the heart of the scandal.

Melbourne,
Australia, resident Paul Gallacher tweeted: 'How was Jacintha Saldanha 
disciplined by the hospital one wonders? The prank was a long shot. 
Hindsight is very convenient.'

Meanwhile,
Matthew Grundy, Tweeting from Victoria, Australia, said: 'British media
rather hypocritical over 2dayfm scandal considering their phone tapping
scandal. Did they hound the nurses involved?'

A fellow Australian Twitter user known only as Sam added: 'No-one could
possibly have foreseen the tragic aftermath of the 2dayfm prank call, 
and therefore the blame game should end.'
