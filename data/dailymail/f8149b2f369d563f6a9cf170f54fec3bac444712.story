Here’s one cub reporter who could bear-ly contain herself as she watched a wildlife photographer at work.

As Dean Swartz took pictures of a black bear family in Minnesota, in the American mid-west, he noticed one young bear watching him very closely.

After about 45 minutes the bear decided to have a go as well and ambled over to the tripod.

Picture perfect: This bear decided it wanted to have a go at being a photographer for the day and seized the opportunity when it saw a man taking photos

Backing off, Mr Swartz used another camera on his shoulder to carry on taking pictures as the animal tried to focus his camera and make sure the scene was set.

Photographer Mr Swartz said: ‘While photographing a black bear sow and her three spring cubs near Ely, Minnesota, I noticed a young bear watching me from the nearby trees. 

‘After about 45 minutes, its curiosity could not be contained. As it approached my tripod-mounted camera, I began talking to her in a firm, but calm voice and began waving my arms to make me look bigger. 

‘She was not deterred and continued to walk slowly toward me in a very unthreatening way. Generally, black bears are quite shy and easily discouraged under circumstances like this. 

What's this? As the black bear approached the camera, photographer Dean Swartz backed off and took photos

Curious: Mr Swartz had tried to frighten the bear by taking to her and waving his arms but her curiosity got the better of her and she walked on undeterred

Focus: Mr Swartz captured the bear as it mimicked his earlier behaviour while he was setting up the shot

‘I slowly backed away about ten feet and using another camera I had over my shoulder, I was able to capture it  as it mimicked my earlier behaviour. I guess she just wanted to make sure I had set the shot up correctly. 

‘The young bear abandoned her camera position only after she knocked the tripod over trying to adjust the direction of the lens. 

‘Fortunately, I was close enough to step forward and catch my very expensive camera and lens before they hit the ground.”

Mr Swartz particularly likes bears and has photographed grizzlies in Alalska, Polar Bears in the Arctic Ocean and Black Bears in Minnesota.

'I guess she just wanted to make sure I had set the shot up correctly' said Mr Schwartz

He added: ‘What has struck me most about the bears I have encountered is that they seem very intelligent and in spite of their awesome physical presence, quite gentle. 

‘If an animal can have a sense of humour then the bear is not only at the top of the food chain but also the smile chain.  

‘I did not see my bear friend again I hope the experience does not cause her to give up her photography career.  She showed great promise,’ he said.
