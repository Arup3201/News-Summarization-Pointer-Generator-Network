The Labour party is now 11 points ahead in the key marginal seats which will decide the next election, a new poll shows.

A ComRes survey of the 40 tightest Labour/Conservative battlegrounds for ITV News is a fresh blow for David Cameron, as he reels from two defections to UKIP.

Mr Cameron has sought to pitch the next election as a straight choice between him and Labour leader Ed Miliband.

A new poll puts Labour 11 points ahead in 40 key marginal seats, but 46 per cent of people would rather see David Cameron remain as Prime Minister

According to the poll, 41 per cent of voters in the marginal seats say they will vote Labour, up five points since a similar poll in June.

The Tories are on 30 per cent, down one point, with UKIP unchanged on 17 per cent and Liberal Democrats on 6 per cent (down one).

In the 2010 general election, Labour and Tories were neck-and-neck on 37 per cent across these seats.

However, Mr Cameron led Mr Miliband by 46 per cent to 33 per cent when voters in the battleground constituencies were asked who they would prefer as Prime Minister.

Six in 10 people claim Ed Miliband puts them off voting Labour, with 46 per cent saying they would rather have David Cameron in Number 10

The Tories hope to focus the election on voters' fears about Mr Miliband.

Mr Cameron said yesterday: 'If you want to have a European referendum, if you want to have immigration control, if you want to get the deficit down, if you want to build a stronger Britain that we can be proud of, there is only one option.

'The choice is really between that government – and we've got a track record now of getting the deficit down, getting people into jobs, taking a correct line on Europe – the choice is that or Ed Miliband in No. 10 Downing Street with no plan for the deficit, no leadership for our country, no way to get the economy growing, the deficit going up, more borrowing, more spending, more taxes. That is the choice,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr.

Overall six in ten (59 per cent) people said that Mr Miliband puts them off voting Labour, including almost two-fifths (38 per cent) who say they back the party.

A third of voters in the marginal seats (33 per cent) said they would consider voting Ukip next year. But half (51 per cent) said they would never vote for Ukip, even if the eurosceptic party could win in their constituency.

ComRes head of political polling Tom Mludzinski said: 'These are the seats where the general election next year will be won and lost and Labour have opened up a convincing lead.

'However, despite the polls pointing to a Labour victory, voters in the marginals prefer David Cameron as a Prime Minister to Ed Miliband and the Conservatives will be hoping that is enough to swing enough people back round to back them when it comes to the ballot in May 2015.'
