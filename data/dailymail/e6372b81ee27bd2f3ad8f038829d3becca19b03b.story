Didier Drogba has urged Chelsea to make history as the striker sets his sights on a second Champions League title.

Chelsea face German side Schalke in their opening group game of Europe's premier club competition on Wednesday.

The match at Stamford Bridge could see Drogba, who has shaken off a minor ankle problem, in his first Champions League appearance for Chelsea since he scored the winning penalty against Bayern Munich in the 2012 final.

'Now we have a Champions League title at this club I think expectation is a bit higher because everybody wants us to do it again â€” so let's go for it,' Drogba told the Evening Standard.

'During the first few weeks I was here, of course you look back and think 'it was like this and that before' but I came back because I want to make history again. That's what I said the first time I was here and nothing has changed.

'We are happy at the moment with the way we are playing and the way the team is responding. We have started well but it's not how you start, it's how you finish.'

The Blues sit top of the Premier League with maximum points after four games and face a crucial title clash at Manchester City on Sunday.
