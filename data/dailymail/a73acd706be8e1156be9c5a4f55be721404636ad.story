Fantasist Christopher Sims, 40, attacked four people with coshes and a hammer. He has been today jailed for life

A violent fantasist who stalked and terrorised a couple for 16 months has been jailed for life.

Christopher Sims hid in bushes as he staked out the £1million home of Graeme and Clare Francis and in a series of incidents attacked them and killed their dog.

Police believe he wanted to live out the plot of his novel which ended with the kidnap of a ‘well-to-do’ couple and the death of the wife.

He researched the couple online and studied pictures of their six-bedroom home on Google, apparently selecting it because it lay on the edge of a village, surrounded by acres of farmland.

Judge Keith Cutler, the Recorder of Winchester, said Mr and Mrs Francis lived in an ‘English countryside idyll’ and told Sims: ‘You turned their peaceful and contented lives into a nightmare of fear and terror.’

Jailing Sims for a minimum term of 16 years, the judge, sitting at Winchester Crown Court, said he had waged ‘a campaign of terror against victims chosen at random, without any cause or excuse.’ He added that the attacks bore a striking resemblance to passages from the ‘average-rate novel’ found on Sims’ memory stick.

He said: ‘Your crimes are motiveless and bizarre. Your behaviour is described as dangerous and your writing showed an ability to conceive extreme and gruesome violence.’

Sims was dubbed the ‘silent stalker’ by villagers in Longparish, near Andover, Hampshire, after he was seen prowling near the couple’s mansion, wearing a balaclava and latex gloves.

The couple were terrified by the sightings and were later attacked in incidents Mrs Francis likened to a horror film. Mr Francis, 61, and his wife, 58, a cookery teacher, called their ordeal a ‘living hell’ and an ‘absolute terror’ which left them afraid to walk alone.

The court heard Sims, 40, lost his 
job as a BT engineer and invested everything in setting up a solar panel
business which failed, costing him the home he shared with his nurse 
wife in Andover.

Christopher Sims stalked wealthy Clare (left) 
and Graeme Francis (right) using Google Earth and shot dead their dog, 
in a 16 month reign of terror. He has today been jailed for life

He moved back to his parents’ home 
but then lived rough, sleeping in a tent where he appeared to have been 
writing the novel while planning his attacks.

Sims wrote that he wanted to become a
‘serial kidnapper’ and planned to attack the owners of ‘quiet country 
houses’ because they were the ‘easiest targets’.

The attacks on the couple began in 
December 2010 when he kicked Mrs Francis to the ground in her garden and
tried to hit her with a cosh, but ran off after she began to scream for
her husband.

In July 2011, he killed their 
five-year-old golden retriever, Saffron, with an air rifle, and 
confronted Mrs Francis later that month while wearing a balaclava and 
blue latex gloves. In the next attack, Sims confronted Mr Francis as he 
left his office in the grounds of the house to walk back to the main 
house.

He hit Mr Francis with an 18-inch 
metal pole, causing a wound which exposed his skull. Mr Francis was left
with a three-inch scar and suffered hearing loss.

Winchester Crown Court heard that he shot dead their golden retriever and attacked them several times on their own property in Longparish, Hampshire (pictured), 'without any apparent anger'

In his novel, Sims wrote: ‘He walked 
down the steps from his office. As he reaches the driveway, this is 
where I will hit him over the head with the cosh and render him 
unconscious. I will drag him behind the building out of sight.’

The couple, who have four children, 
were left needing anti-depressants and sleeping tablets to cope with the
ordeal. Police were so concerned by the violence of the attacks that 
they installed panic alarms and offered to put the couple in a safe 
house.

Sims was stopped by police once in 
Longparish but released after giving his details. He had no previous 
convictions or history of mental illness.

He was caught only after he attacked 
two other men, clubbing 74-year-old John Casey three times with a lump 
hammer after he gave Sims a lift in his car. Sims stopped only when the 
hammer broke.

Judge Cutler said: ‘With enormous 
presence of mind and great bravery Mr Casey put his fingers in your 
mouth so if police found his body there would be a record of your DNA.’

Sims later attacked kebab van owner Ercan Yucekaya, 22, in a layby near Hook on two occasions late at night.

After his arrest in March 2012, police discovered the novel in his tent and realised that he was Mr and Mrs Francis’s stalker.

The couple aged in their 60s were attacked in their 'rural idyll' of Longparish (pictured). They called the ordeal a 'living hell' and an 'absolute terror' that has left them afraid to walk alone and on anti-depressants and sleeping tablets

Sims pleaded guilty to seven charges 
including the harassment of Mr and Mrs Francis and grievous bodily harm 
attacks on Mr Francis, Mr Casey and Mr Yucekaya.

Judge Cutler said the reasons for the
attacks remained a ‘complete mystery’ because Sims – who claims not to 
remember the assaults – had refused to see a court-appointed 
psychiatrist.

After his arrest, he was treated at 
Broadmoor for a suspected personality disorder but doctors cannot agree 
whether his claimed amnesia is genuine or fake.

Judge Cutler rejected calls by Sims’ lawyers to give him a hospital order but urged him to co-operate with doctors in prison.

Although the minimum term means Sims 
could be considered for parole in eight years, Judge Cutler said he 
would be kept in prison for the rest of his life if doctors believed he 
continued to pose a risk to the public.

Speaking after the case, Mr Francis, a
mergers and acquisitions lawyer who has worked with Heston Blumenthal 
as company secretary of the chef’s famous Fat Duck restaurant, said he 
believed the sentence was appropriate.

He said: ‘We are very pleased that 
this is all over and behind us. I would like to thank our friends and 
family for their support and the police for their efforts.’
