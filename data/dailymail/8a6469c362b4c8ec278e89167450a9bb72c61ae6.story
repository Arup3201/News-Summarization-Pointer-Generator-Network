A man has admitted murdering Irish vet C whose disappearance last October sparked North Wales Police’s largest ever search operation.

Ms Gowing’s body has never been fully recovered but remains were found at two rural locations near her home in Flintshire, north Wales, and near Chester.

Clive Sharp, 46, originally from Sealand on Deeside but who had an address in Bethesda in Gwynedd, yesterday pleaded guilty to the murder of the 37-year-old when he appeared at Mold Crown Court. 

In court: Clive Sharp, 46, today pleaded guilty to the murder of vet Catherine Gowing, 37, from Mold, Flintshire, who was last seen on CCTV footage in a supermarket near her home in October last year

Flanked by two prison officers, Sharp, unshaven and wearing a grey pullover and grey jogging bottoms, sat in the dock with his head down for most of the brief hearing.

Yards away, the victim's sister, Emma Maguire, sat listening intently as the hearing continued.

Sharp is understood to have been friends with a woman who shared a house with Ms Gowing, though no evidence was given in court yesterday.

After pleading guilty to the murder of Ms Gowing, sometime between October 11 and October 17 last year, Sharp was warned he faces life in jail.

But Mr Justice Griffith-Williams said he
would not sentence Sharp immediately as he has to determine the minimum
term he must serve before he can be considered for release.

He
also said there were a 'number of concerns' about the murder that he 
needed to consider before setting a minimum term of imprisonment.

The
court heard in a report on the defendant that Sharp had 'expressed his 
fantasies' and the judge asked for a complete history of his criminal 
record to be prepared.

Adjourning
sentencing until next month, the judge told Sharp: 'There is only one 
sentence I can impose upon you for this offence, as you well know.

'I have to indicate the minimum term you
will serve before the Parole Board will consider your release - if you 
are ever to be released.

'Sentencing is adjourned until Monday the 25th of February. You can be taken down.'

The judge added that he appreciated that
the delay would add to the upset and tension of the family and loved 
ones but he said that careful assessment would have to be made.

Ms Gowing's family left court without commenting.

Miss
Gowing, originally from County Offaly in the Republic of Ireland but 
who lived with a work colleague at the village of New Brighton near 
Mold, worked at a local veterinary centre.

Destroyed: Cathering Gowings burnt out Renault Clio was found abandoned at a quarry pond four days after her disappearance

Abandoned: The torched and abandoned car was found just two miles from Ms Gowing's home in New Brighton, Flintshire

Miss Gowing had not been seen since a sighting of her on CCTV at a supermarket near her home on Friday October 12.

North Wales Police found her burnt out car close to a disused quarry at Alltami, less than two miles from her home.

An extensive search of the area around the quarry and its pool was carried out by specialist police teams including divers.

But
her remains were found in two separate areas, at Sealand and at the 
River Dee close to Chester, which were buried in her home town.
