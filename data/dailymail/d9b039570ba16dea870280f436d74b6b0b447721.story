Shoppers face an anxious wait over whether Christmas gifts bought on the web will arrive after delivery networks buckled under the weight of orders.

The spending binge around Black Friday and this week’s Manic Monday overwhelmed some of the country’s biggest internet retailers, forcing them to tear up their delivery promises.

The problem has been made worse by the fact the transport industry faces a drastic shortage of drivers.

An estimated £810million was spent online on Black Friday which was 50 per cent higher than expected and effectively broke the delivery systems

It emerged earlier this week that Marks & Spencer was unable to cope with the scale of orders with the result that some shoppers have faced delivery delays of ten days and even longer.

However, it is now clear there were problem at other household names such as Amazon, Tesco, Asos, Argos, Ao.com, Currys PC World, River Island, Very, Littlewoods and Debenhams.

An estimated £810million was spent online on Black Friday which was 50per cent higher than expected and effectively broke the delivery systems.

Added to this was another £666million on Manic Monday, which meant many thousands of new orders poured into the system.

Many of the companies suffering delays use the Yodel courier firm, which has been unable to cope with the weight of orders.

The firm set a target of hiring 2,830 self-employed couriers, 470 self-employed van drivers and 760 employed drivers to cover Christmas.

The company claims to have met this target, however it is still frantically recruiting across the UK, promising to pay around £140 a day to people who use their own cars.

The Yodel website carries the warning: ‘We are continuing to receive extremely high numbers of parcels as a result of the seasonal sales. We’re working hard to get your orders to you asap, but some may experience a slight delay in arriving.’

Jonathan Smith, chairman of InPost UK, which offers click and collect lockers for web purchases, said: ‘The trend towards seasonal discounting and last-minute sales is making the Christmas peak even peakier.

Further pressure was added on transport services by another £666million being spent on Manic Monday

‘The increase in online sales and orders as a result of the surge in demand over ‘Black Friday’ Christmas offers has clearly put a large amount of pressure on the ability for retailers to deliver and has presented a series of logistical challenges, shown by the large number of retailers currently experiencing severe delivery delays.’

Amazon recorded 5.5million orders on Black Friday, an average of 64 items every second. As a result there were delays for people who expected next day deliveries under the Amazon Prime service.

Some of the company’s deliveries are handled by Yodel, which has been the target of complaints on the web giant’s Facebook page.

Yesterday, customer Roland Keates complained: ‘You have some great deals at Amazon, just change carrier. Yodel are rubbish, post a ‘while you were out card’ through the door, without ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door. They really let your side down.’

Pebbles Bayliss added: ‘Yodel are atrocious. One of them threw my delivery onto my car port roof thinking it was just a gate not a door, it’s 7ft high. They also give you a delivery window of 08:00 to 21:00 as if I don’t have a life.’

Andy Shaw wrote: ‘Amazon have debited my bank account then said they can’t deliver item and won’t refund my account for up to 10 days!!’

Another customer, Nicola Milton, complained of Amazon delivery ‘dirty tricks’.

She wrote: ‘I’d like to warn people about what Amazon are up to this year. Bought tons of Xmas presents which hadn’t been delivered and when I checked my Amazon account turns out they had mysteriously been returned.

‘Suddenly my stuff which I wanted is returned and now if I want to buy again the prices have mysteriously gone up.’

Amazon whose Swansea, Wales, warehouse is pictured above, said: ‘As a result of the unprecedented number of orders we received during Black Friday Deals Week, the delivery date we promised to some customers was a little longer than would normally have been expected. Normal service has now resumed

Other companies that use Yodel include Argos, River Island, Very and Littlewoods.

Argos admitted it was forced to extend delivery times from four to seven days in order to rebuild stock levels after the Black Friday promotions. It says deliveries are back to normal.

However, Ray Hamill wrote on its Facebook page: ‘How about you just deliver your paid for orders on time? As opposed to making me use two days of leave for nothing.’

Another customer, Paul Fleming, wrote: ‘What’s the point of ordering anything from Argos when you clearly can’t fulfil your delivery obligations. There are websites packed full of disappointed Argos customers due to non-delivery and poor customer service.’

Amazon said: ‘As a result of the unprecedented number of orders we received during Black Friday Deals Week, the delivery date we promised to some customers was a little longer than would normally have been expected. Normal service has now resumed.

Argos said: ‘Home delivery service is now running at normal levels and customers placing orders today will receive deliveries within our usual timeframe.

‘We apologise to any customer whose recent home delivery order was affected by a temporary delay caused by very high demand for a limited number of home delivery items on Black Friday.’

Yodel describes itself as the UK’s leading parcel carrier. It handles over 135 million parcels every year and claims to work with 80per cent of the UK’s top retailers.

The firm said it has hired all the staff it thought were needed. ‘We worked closely with our clients to set our resource targets. Recruitment began in September and the targets successfully met,’ said a spokesman.

Shop Direct’s Very and Littlewoods brands apologised to customers on Twitter for delays to deliveries as a result of Black Friday.

It changed the delivery promise on the Thursday before Black Friday from 24 hours to 48 hours, and extended it to 72 hours. It reduced the delivery window back to 48 hours and is hoping to get back to 24 hours.

River Island was so worried by the backlog that it told customers on Twitter that ‘couriers have had massive delays as a result of Black Friday’. Sources at the firm say these have been resolved.

Currys PC World postponed its next-day delivery promise on small-box items for a period, but this was restored yesterday(wed). Debenhams admitted its delivery services had suffered temporary delays, but it said they are back to normal.

The specialist household appliances website, Ao.com, said its same-day delivery service and free next-day delivery was out of action for a period because of the ‘increased demand over the Black Friday weekend’.

Tesco suffered delays in its click and collect service for a time and the online fashion brand ASOS suspended a large part of its next day delivery system. However, both appear to be back to normal.
