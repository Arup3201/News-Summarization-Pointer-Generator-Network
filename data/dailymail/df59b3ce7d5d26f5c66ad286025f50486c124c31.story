Teenagers Ben Proud and Siobhan O’Connor confirmed themselves as the rising stars of English swimming in the final session of this meet on Tuesday night, Proud taking his second gold of the Games and O’Connor winning a record-breaking sixth medal.

England also took gold in the  4x100 metres medley relay, shocking the Australian favourites. Chris Walker-Hebborn, Adam Peaty, Adam Barrett and Adam Brown were the awesome foursome who did it in a Games record time.

Peaty said: ‘These guys are like my brothers and we brought it home for England!’

Winner: Ben Proud celebrates winning the men's 50m freestyle on Tuesday night

Londoner Proud, 19, grew up in Malaysia and has hazy memories of the Kuala Lumpur Games of 1998, which ended on his fourth birthday.

On Tuesday night he was a maker of memories for future generations, adding the 50m freestyle title to his 50m butterfly gold. He also leaves these Games with a bronze from the 100m freestyle relay.

‘It’s amazing to win two golds,’ he said. ‘To be honest I came here without expectations, just to gain experience and race against some great swimmers.’

O’Connor, 18, from Bilton, Oxfordshire, claimed a sixth medal of these Games by helping England to silver in the medley relay.

Pace: The 19-year-old came home in 21.92 seconds - eight hundredths of a second in front of Cameron McEvoy

No English woman in any sport has won more than six medals at a Games and only one woman before has won as many as six: swimmer Mel Marshall in 2006.

O’Connor’s haul included a gold in the 200m individual medley  and therefore tops Marshall’s four silvers and two bronze.

On an occasion that again stirred optimism for British swimming as a whole, Wales took a gold as Georgina Davies won the 50m backstroke in a Games record time, a silver as Jazz Carlin finished second in the 400m freestyle and a bronze as Daniel Jervis surged to a late third place in the 1500m marathon.

Scotland got in on the act as Dan Wallace seized silver in the 200m individual medley behind Australia’s Dan Tranter but ahead of South African superstar Chad le Clos in third.

This has been a redemptive experience for Wallace, 21, arrested in May in Florida, where he trains, for urinating on a police car.

He vowed to turn his life around and has done so in short order. He won gold in the 400m last week and said: ‘That silver was the cherry on top. When you’re on the BBC every night you definitely get a lot of attention from girls and boys. I just love the fans.

‘My dream is to be famous, so I guess this is where it all starts. Hopefully one day I’ll be a superstar in the sporting world.’

Proud produced a stunning burst in the ‘splash and dash’ 50m free on Tuesday night to finish in 21.91sec, ahead of the Australian duo of Cameron McEvoy and James Magnussen. A common thread to the English successes here has been Jon Rudd, coach of the Plymouth Leander club where Proud is based and also England coach for these Games.

‘He was just as happy as I was — it’s not just a gold for me, it’s a gold for him,’ Proud said.

‘I managed
 to keep my cool quite well,’ he added. ‘I’ve learnt from the past and 
when I get too nervous I start blacking out and I can’t think what I’ve 
got to do. For the finals it’s about getting every detail right.’

Carlin,
 23, took silver in the 400m free — won by Canada’s Lauren Boyle — to 
add to the gold she won on Monday in the 800m. That and Davies’s gold 
meant Wales won two swimming golds at a Games for the first time.

Wallace
 thrilled the home crowd by arriving poolside in a kilt. ‘The emotions 
when I came out were amazing,’ he said. ‘Being the home nation we 
thought we’d show our pride in our Scottish side and do a special thing 
for the fans.’
