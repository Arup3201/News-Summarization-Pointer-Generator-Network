Heather Mills has accused Paralympic officials of 'having it in for her' in an six-minute YouTube rant over a row about a specially adapted ski-boot which saw her disqualified from competing.

Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife dramatically quit the UK disabled ski team after Sylvana Mestre - technical head at the International Paralympic Committee -  told her the short boot she was wearing for a competition in Pitztal, Austria, wasn't approved by the organisation.

Ms Mestre reportedly told the 45-year-old she would have to change the boot to comply with the rules - a move that Ms Mills said would give her 'intolerable pain'.

A source at the IPC said she then 
launched into a 'disgraceful outburst', and 'verbally abused and 
physically harassed staff' after she was told she could not compete.

Heather Mills has accused Paralympic officials of 'having it in for her' in an six-minute YouTube rant over a row about a specially adapted ski-boot which saw her disqualified from competing

Ms Mills dramatically quit the UK disabled ski team after Sylvana Mestre - technical head at the International Paralympic Committee -  told her the boot pictured here and which she was wearing for a competition in Pitztal, Austria, wasn't approved by the organisation

The leg was approved for use but the IPC said she had not submitted her new boot for ratification and would have to revert to standard equipment until it had been passed for use in competition

Sylvana Mestre: A furious Heather Mills allegedly shouted at her

It was claimed she shouted 'you b*tch, you b*tch' at the offical, and threatened to make her life 'miserable.'

But
 in the video, which shows Ms Mills sitting next to the offending boot, 
 the former glamour model dismisses the claims of abuse as 'tabloid rubbish'.

She said: 'I never physically touched her.

'The reports that she begged me not to hit her are tabloid rubbish.'

At the end of the rant she concludes:
 'It seems to me in the years that I was trying to do this for Britain, 
Sylvana Mestre had it in for me and wanted me out.'

But in the video, which shows Ms Mills sitting next to the offending boot,  the former glamour model dismisses the claims as 'rubbish'

Mills' management said that wearing the boot cover, which locks to her left leg below the knee, causes a large amount of friction, painful inflammation and blisters

The mother-of-one was preparing herself for the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games after she was offered a trial on the ski team's development squad in 2010.

Despite 
Mills’ World Cup skiing success, she struggled through her 
qualification for the Paralympics – with problems including being 
‘ejected’ from her prosthetic leg when practising slalom.

In the 
summer, she had a new leg and boot design created by London Prosthetics 
Centre to help reduce the problem.

The leg was approved for use but the IPC said she had not submitted her new boot for ratification and would have to revert to standard equipment until it had been passed for use in competition.

She was about to qualify for a place in next year's Paralympic Games when the row erupted.

She was told she must wear a cover 
over her boot and prosthetic leg to comply with international rules.

Resort: She was told the boot she was wearing for a competition in Pitztal, Austria, wasn't approved

Competition: Heather Mills, who lost half her leg in 1993, stands with first place winner Melanie Schwartzc after competing in the Women's Slalom in New Zealand in August of this year

Mills’
management said that wearing the boot cover, which locks to her left 
leg below the knee, causes a large amount of friction, painful 
inflammation and blisters. 

She claimed that she had been 'asked to do the video' to explain her disqualification.

She
 said: ''While I was skiing in Pitztal last week, I was on inspection, 
and I noticed Sylvana Mestre following me down the mountain, but didn't 
think anything of it at the time.

'The next thing I get a phone call from my GB coach Tony saying I was disqualified.

Ms
 Mills said she then attended a competition technical meeting in which 
her use of an unapproved prosthetic leg was being discussed, despite the
 fact she was not supposed to have attended.

She then claims that Ms Mestre 'stormed over', saying  'The rules are the rules', and informed her she was disqualified.

She added: 'I stayed quiet... I put my hand on her shoulder to try and 
explain but she just said "I don't care" and stormed back to the table.

Mills lost her left leg below the knee in 1993 after she was knocked down by a police motorcycle.

She set up the Heather Mills Trust which helps people who have lost limbs to landmines.

She married former Beatle Sir Paul in June 2002 but split four years later in 2006.

After her divorce in 2008, she began skiing and preparing for the Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. She is ranked 28th in the world in slalom.

Last year it was reported that she had bought a chalet near Goldeck am Millstätter See, in the Austrian Alps, for £1.4million as a base for her training.
