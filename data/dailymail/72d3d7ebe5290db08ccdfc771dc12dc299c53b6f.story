Martyr: Sangay Dolma betrays nothing in this picture of her plan to set herself on fire in the name of home and country

Peering thoughtfully into the camera, her mouth curved into the faintest of smiles, 17-year-old Sangay Dolma looks the picture of youthful promise.

But by the time she took this photograph in the darkness of her bedroom, her plans were already in motion to travel to a Chinese government office building in eastern Tibet, douse herself in petrol and light a match.

The only clue to her final act are the haunting words, scrawled roughly on her hand in Tibetan script: 'Tibet is an independent nation'.

By then she knew this act of self-immolation 
would be her last, so she left a will in an envelope, alongside this 
picture, written in the form of a poem.

At the head of the note, she wrote: 'Beloved children of the Snow Lion, sons 
and daughters of the Land of Snows, warriors of the snow mountain, don’t
forget your are Tibetans.'

She
became the latest of a string of young Tibetans to set fire to 
themselves in the name of independence when she took her life in a ball 
of flame on November 26.

Since
March 2011, around 90 people are known to have set themselves on fire 
in protest against the Chinese occupation of Tibet. There were 25 in 
November alone, according to campaigners.

This
wave of self-immolations reveal 
the desperation among Tibet's youth after 60 years under Beijing's 
thumb and underlie a harsh crackdown in recent years by the Chinese 
government any who dare question its sovereignty over the mountain 
nation.

Until her tragic and violent death, Sangay Dolma had been a nun at the Gonshul Nunnery near the Sangag Mindrol 
Dhargeyling Monastery.

She left a note with the picture, in Tibetan script, which included the words: 'Look up, Tibetans, look at the snow mountains. The snowland’s era has begun. And Tibet is free and independent'

There she would have been well 
schooled in Buddhist teachings, in particular its emphasis on 
non-violence, even in the face of conflict. Indeed, the first of the five precepts that all Buddhists should follow is 'avoid killing, or harming any living thing'.

Her death serves as a stark reminder 
of the passion that fuels this spate of self immolations and
the lengths young people in Tibet are prepared to go in order to raise 
awareness of their region's plight.

She goes on with a call to arms to her countrymen to join her fight for a free Tibet.

Sangay Dolma's name joins a rapidly growing list
of young Tibetans so angry at their Chinese rulers that they are willing to 
make the ultimate sacrifice in a bid to draw the world's attention to their region's plight.

Self immolations in Tibet have become so common that they happen on an almost daily basis.

Already since Sangay Dolma's death, on November 26, nine Tibetans have followed suit as calls for an independent 
Tibet continued to echo throughout the world, according to campaign group Free Tibet.

In November, 25 protesters - aged
between 15 and 30 - set themselves on fire, following ten such cases in October.

And on Sunday, 17-year-old Sangdak Kyab, set himself on fire near the Bhora Monastery in Sangchu County. He is believed to have survived and was taken away by Chinese police.

The
first stanza reads: 'Look up, fellow Tibetans, look at the blue 
twilight above, Like a heavenly tent of white mountain, My lama has 
returned.'

In the fourth 
stanza, goes on: 'Look up, Tibetans, look at the snow mountains. The 
snowland’s era has begun. And Tibet is free and independent.'

In
the two closing stanzas, she pays tribute to the Dalai Lama and the 
Panchen Lama, who has been missing since 1995, spirited away by the 
Chinese government at the age of six after he was officially named the 
reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama.

'His Holiness the Dalai Lama, when he
lived far away, he travelled around the world, praying for the end of 
suffering of the red-faced Tibetans, and released us from darkness, at a
time when Panchen Lama is in prison, he looks out from his prison cell,
prays for "the dawn of peace and happiness in my land of snow".'

She becomes the sixth person to set herself on fire in Tibet in as many weeks.

The
Chinese government has sought to crack down on Tibetan dissidents 
issuing a stern warning to the authorities of eastern Tibet to punish 
all self-immolators and their relatives - and even those who send 
condolences to bereaved families.

It
said all government aid would be removed from the families of 
self-immolators while development projects in communities that have been
home to such protesters would be cancelled.

The
charity and campaign group Free Tibet says it has documented multiple 
cases of collective punishment, imposed against the communities and 
families were individuals have set themselves on fire, or were other 
forms of protest have taken place.

It says punishments have included 
homes being ransacked, development projects which were planned for a 
village cancelled and ‘public criticism’.

Of
the 90 protesters who have set themselves on fire, the majority have 
died of their injuries. Those who survive, are arrested and taken away. 
They are rarely seen again, say campaign groups.

Stephanie Bridger, director of Free Tibet, said:
'Tibetans from all walks of life, young and old, mothers, nomads, 
students, monks and nuns are rejecting China’s occupation of their 
homeland.

Burning issue: Since March 2011, around 90 people are known to have set themselves on fire in protest against the Chinese occupation of Tibet. In March this year, Tibetan exile Jamphel Yeshi, 27, set himself on fire during a protest in New Delhi

Tibet's spiritual leaders: Sangay Dolma paid 
tribute to the Dalai Lama, left, and the Panchen Lama, right, who has been missing 
since 1995 since he was named the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama aged six

'Warriors of the snow mountain': Mount Everest as seen from the Rongbuk Monastery in Tibet, China. In her poem, Sangay Dolma urges Tibetans to 'Look up at the snow mountains... The snowland's era has begun... Tibet is free and independent'

'China is trying to crush protest through arbitrary detention, collective punishment, communications blackouts, bribery and much more – this has only strengthened the resolve of the Tibetan people in their struggle for freedom. 

'Free Tibet is receiving reports of protests inside Tibet on an almost daily basis. These protests will only continue until each and everyone one of us stands with the Tibetan people in their struggle for freedom and our Governments stop kowtowing to an unelected Chinese regime.'

But it is also a moral and policy dilemma for Tibet's spiritual 
leader, the Dalai Lama, and a new generation of exiled 
politicians.            

The
Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 with hundreds of followers and they 
set up base in Dharamsala, a town in the Himalayan foothills about 400 
km (250 miles) north of New Delhi.           

The
deaths raise theological questions about non-violence and highlight a 
long-standing schism between the elderly Dalai Lama's softly, softly 
approach to China and activists who want to fight for 
independence.
