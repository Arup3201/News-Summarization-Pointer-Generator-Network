Eric Silverman is breathing a sigh of relief after doctors told him they believe his Ebola scare is actually just malaria

The Brooklyn man who was quarantined in New York and suspected to have been infected with Ebola probably just has malaria.

Humanitarian worker Eric Silverman, 27, had just returned from a four-month stint in Sierra Leone, where he was doing farming and building work, when he started developing symptoms similar to those shown by Ebola victims.

When Mr Silverman initially tested negative for malaria he became terrified that he may have the killer disease, but now it turns out that he probably does have malaria after all.

Mr Silverman returned to New York on July 17 for his mother's birthday, and developed severe stomach pains and high fever two weeks later.

To go with the diarrhoea, sore throat and headaches, he was quarantined in Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital and had to deal with the fearful prospect that he may be the latest victim of the untreatable disease.

He was kept in an isolated glass box for more than 72 hours, as Americans all over the country feared the disease had spread to their shores, but an infectious disease doctor has now told him that all the evidence suggests he has malaria - a disease he had already contracted back in February. 

'I've been taking a lot of medicine, and so that kind of might have interfered, and so they couldn't spot any malaria in my blood work, but it could still be there,' Silverman told CBS New York.

Mr Silverman was known as 'Ebola Patient Zero' all over America, and he told the New York Daily News: 'Even my friends didn’t believe me when I told them I was the mystery patient. They thought I was joking.'

Mr Silverman plans to return to Sierra Leone to continue his humanitarian work

He recounted how he first fell ill: 'I turned up the heat in the car to 90 degrees and drove back to Brooklyn — then I got out of the car and I was freezing again.

'My mother took my temperature and it was 104. When she called our family doctor, she said to get me to the emergency room at Mount Sinai.'

Silverman's nurse, Margaret Kraus, compared the next 72 hours to the night the hospital went on overdrive to house extra patients forced to evacuate another hospital during Hurricane Sandy.

'If he had the Ebola virus, we all knew how it could impact so many people’s lives,' she said.

Now that he has been given the all-clear, Mr Silverman plans to return to Sierra Leone to continue his humanitarian work once the Ebola outbreak has cleared up.

The virus claimed its first European victim on Monday, when 75-year-old Spanish priest Miguel Pajares died five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid for expert care.

The overall death toll is now at 1,069 people, and with it continuing to rise with no signs of stopping, the World Health Organisation declared it ethical to use untested drugs to attempt to control it.
