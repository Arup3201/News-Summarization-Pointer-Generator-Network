An Atlanta father has stabbed to death his two sons, fatally beaten his wife and hanged himself in a shocking murder-suicide, police said.

Officers discovered the bodies of Shindiver Grover, 52, his wife Damanjit Kaur-Grover, 47, and their sons, Sartaj Grover, 12, and Gurtej Grover, 5, in their spacious first-floor apartment in the northeastern suburb of Johns Creek on Monday morning.

The horrific deaths stunned friends and relatives who mourned the 'loving' family at their Sikh Gurdwara, a place of worship for the Sikh community that they belonged to, in nearby Roswell.

'It is very hard to believe,' a leader said at the gathering, according to WSBTV. 'It's a big loss, it's even harder to accept to such a nice loving family.'

Officers found the four bodies at around 11:30 a.m. after a friend of Damanjit's asked police to check the apartment when the mother failed to 
show up to work on Monday, Johns Creek Police Chief Ed Densmore said.

He didn't reveal any possible motive for the murder-suicide.

Autopsies showed both children died of sharp-force injuries to the neck including stab wounds, incised wounds and chop wounds. Damanjit, who was also known as Daisy, died of blunt-force head injuries.

Shocked: Neighbors are shocked, insisting the Grovers were a happy family

The manner of death for all three has been ruled a homicide but Shindiver Grover's death has been ruled a suicide by hanging, according to Fulton County medical examiner's office.

Neighbors are baffled by the family's
 deaths, insisting the Grovers were a 'happy couple' and that nothing 
had suggested there was trouble in the apartment in the newly 
established Atlanta suburb.

'The father comes out nearly every 
morning and puts the kids on the school bus,' a neighbor who lives in an
 adjoining complex told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, adding that she regularly saw the two boys playing.

Another neighbor, Joseph Olander, called the Grovers 'a very loving couple' and told the Journal-Constitution he heard nothing unusual on Monday morning.

No motive: Police haven't revealed any potential motive in the murder-suicide

DensmoreÂ  told reporters that the investigation into what happened in the apartment on Monday was 'complicated.'

'It's a rather complicated crime scene right now,' Densmore said. 'We're going to be here for hours.'

He said that even seasoned investigators were struggling to deal with the horrific slayings.

'It's pretty bad as you can imagine,' he said. 'Any time you deal with something this bad involving kids, it's heart-wrenching.'

Emory Healthcare, Daisy Grover's employer, released a statement to WSBTV regarding the loss of their 'beloved' employee.

'Daisy was a beloved member of the Emory Healthcare staff and was known for her love and compassion for her children, family and patients. Our deepest sympathy and condolences go out to Daisy's family members and friends during this time of loss,' the health provider said.
