Jacqui Lambie thinks her Palmer United Party boss and colleagues should follow her lead if they want the party to survive.

Senator Lambie is refusing to pass any government legislation until the Abbott government betters a below inflation pay deal for Defence, even if it has the support of PUP and its leader, Clive Palmer.

'If I'm told I'll follow the party line, the party will be shown I won't be following the party line and it's up to Clive Palmer to ask me to leave,' she told ABC TV.

She denied there was a split in the party but concedes her relationship with Mr Palmer can be strained.

'Well, you know, it's up and down with Clive Palmer, so, you know, there's going to be some argy-bargy ... but once again I'm asking him to help those people that he knows I'm trying to help and I just don't feel like I'm getting support out of Clive Palmer or the Palmer United Party senators with that,' she said.

'I just don't feel like they're helping me out. So if that means I've got to go it alone under the PUP flag then so be it, I'll just run it alone,' she added, according to Fairfax. 

Senator Lambie will vote with her conscience on issues affecting Tasmania, veterans and military pay, and wants more support from her party.

'I just don't feel like I'm getting support out of Clive Palmer or the Palmer United Party senators,' Ms Lambie said, adding: 'if that means I've got to go it alone under the PUP flag then so be it'

Her comments come only a few days after Mr Palmer publicly slammed her idea to use Remembrance Day as an event to protest the wages of Defence Force members.

While Ms Lambie called on Australians and war veterans to turn their backs on government members during their speeches on the day, Mr Palmer dismissed her call-out over Twitter. 

'All Australians, particularly politicians, should show the utmost respect on Remembrance Day. It is never a day for political actions,' he wrote.

Senator Lambie also warned that unless her colleagues started using their consciences a bit more, PUP might start losing its bearings.

Earlier in the week, while Ms Lambie called on Australians and war veterans to turn their backs on government members during their speeches on Remembrance Day, Mr Palmer slammed her call-out over Twitter

'If the party is going to survive then they better come up with a bloody better plan of attack than they've been using,' she said.

'One thing I won't do is, I won't lie to the Australian people and I'm not going to sit here and make my PUP senators and Clive Palmer look good when I'm not feeling that way about them. I won't do that.'

Former PUP insiders also told the ABC they resigned in frustration because party members were not going to be really allowed to organise or participate in policy formulation and debate.
