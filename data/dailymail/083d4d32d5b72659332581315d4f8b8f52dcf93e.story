A mother switched on her new DVD player for her children to watch a Disney film - only for hardcore pornography to flash up on the screen.

Mother-of-three Samantha John, 25, had bought the DVD player from an Argos store as an Easter present for her children aged six, four and one.

She wired it to the family's widescreen TV - but before she could insert a Disney film into the machine a 'disgusting' image flashed up on screen in front of her family.

Samantha John, with her three children Kady, Natalya (striped top) and Kayla, was shocked when the graphic images flashed up onscreen

It was offering three different pornographic movies and showed an explicit picture from each of the films.

Stunned Samantha said: 'I panicked - I could not believe my eyes.

'It was not something you would want your children to see - it was disgusting.

'I was desperately looking for the off button on the DVD player but because it was new I couldn't find it.

'My eldest was saying: "What's that mummy?" I didn't know what to say.

'I just lunged forward at the TV and switched it off at the mains.

'I feel as if my children's innocence has been taken away from them.'

The mother discover that her children's Easter present contained a DVD marked 'xxx' containing hardcore pornorgraphy

Ms John, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, paid £19.99 for the Argos Value DVD player after her old one broke.

But she noticed there was no remote control in the box - or any instruction leaflet.

Samantha bought the DVD last Thursday and gave it to her children on Easter Sunday.

She said: 'It was packed in the normal way, wedged between two pieces of white polystyrene.

'It looked new but obviously someone had been using it to watch an explicit adult movie.

'And from what I saw on the screen it was very explicit.'

Samantha ejected the DVD to find a white disk with the letters 'XXX' on it.

Definitely not Disney: Argos says it has launched an investigation after the mother complained to them about the DVD

She is now worried her little girls Kady, six, Natalya, four and Kyla, one, will be left damaged by the images.

She said: 'They have hundreds of DVDs but I had bought them The Tooth Fairy and Marmaduke to go with the DVD.

'I am shocked and upset that they could have ended up watching something else altogether.

'What if I hadn't been in the room?'

Samantha's father-in-law Christopher Ryan, 45, complained to Argos but claims he was told it was 'no big deal' because the girls were too young to realise what was on the screen.

He said: 'I was speechless. It is bad enough someone left pornography in the DVD player but to dismiss it like it was nothing is extraordinary.'

A spokesman for Argos said: 'Argos is a family retailer and we were extremely concerned to learn of this incident.

'We have asked the customer to return the player to our store so we can carry out an urgent investigation.'
