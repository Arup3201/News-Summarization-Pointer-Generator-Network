More than 500,000 people have signed an online petition requesting that Macy’s ends it association with Donald Trump.

The retailer, which exclusively sells Trump’s clothing line and fragrance, has also made him central to its just launched Christmas advertising campaign.

The petition at SignOn.org says Macy’s should break with Trump because of his ‘especially unpleasant, nasty and despicable behavior.’

Twitter spat: Donald Trump has hit back at Cher, saying she should focus on her 'dying career!'

Cher has threatened to never shop at Macy's again if they don't stop working with Donald Trump

Trump hasn't commented directly about the petition but has taken to Twitter to promote his 'Success' fragrance

Trump has used his Twitter feed to promote his Macy's clothing line since an online petition to dump him was launched

'Donald Trump does not reflect the "magic of Macy's." We urge you to sever ties with him,' the petition reads.

Cher is amongst those who has signed 
the petition. She has called Trump a 'loudmouth, racist cretin' over his
 criticism of Obama.

'I’ll NEVER GO TO MACY’S AGAIN! I didn’t know they sold Donald Trump’s Line!' she wrote on Twitter.

Of course Trump was quick and hit back at Cher and posted: '@cher should spend more time focusing on her family and dying career!'

Trump had yet to personally addressed 
the petition on his Twitter feed, but he has made a point of 
tweeting about his Macy's-stocked clothing line and fragrance.

'My fragrance - 'Success' - is flying off the shelves @Macys. The perfect Christmas gift!' he wrote. 

Yesterday he posted: 'Just saw my new line of shirts, ties & suits @Macys – they are fantastic! Would make great holiday presents!'

The petition was created by Angelo Carusone, who has previously campaigned against Glenn Beck.

The
 homepage for the petition cites several examples of Donald’s 
‘despicable behavior,' including his ‘sexist’ comments about women, his 
denial of climate change and his hypocrisy by manufacturing his own 
clothes in China but criticizing others for sending jobs abroad.

Trump
 is also notorious for long promoting the discredited conspiracy theory 
that President Obama was not born in the United States.

Prior
 to last week's presidential election, Trump raised the issue once again
 and issued an ultimatum to Obama, claiming that he would donate 
$5million to charity if the President released his college records and 
passport application.

On
 election night itself, Trump tweeted that the final result was 'a 
travesty, a total sham, a disgusting injustice' and 'urged Americans to 
march on Washington.'

NBC's Brian Williams read out Trump's
 comments on his show and accused Donald of having 'driven well past the
 last exit to relevance.'

Macy’s
 new holiday ad, which spoofs 'Miracle on 34th Street', makes light of 
Trump’s support of the so-called 'birther' movement.

Assuming the role of the skeptic, Trump yanks on Santa’s beard after asking, 'What’s with the get-up, Kris?'

The commercial ends with Santa Claus saying to Trump, 'If I can win you over, there’s still hope.'

Trump’s spokesman Michael Cohen has expressed confidence in the strength of his client’s relationship with the retailer.

'Mr. Trump is important to Macy’s, both as a brand and as an endorser. His ties, shirts, cufflinks, fragrances and other merchandise are top-selling items across the country - in particular Mr. Trump’s ties are the number one selling ties at Macy’s,' he told The Daily News.
