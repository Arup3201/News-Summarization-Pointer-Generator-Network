Scottish lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has become the latest famous face to complete the ice bucket challenge.

The Glaswegian businesswoman joined the social media craze during a trip to South Africa in front of a crowd of 500 people.

Pouring the water was entrepreneur JT Foxx who introduced the Scot before saying he was going to 'lead her down the aisle' to a chair.

The Scottish lingerie tycoon was on a trip to South Africa when she was nominated to complete the challenge

She was 'led down an aisle' by entrepreneur JT Foxx in front of a crowd of 500 people 

She then sits down and faces the camera, saying: 'I have been nominated and accept the challenge. I nominate John Caldwell, Sir Tom Hunter, Ian Poulter and her daughter Bethany.'

The bucket of ice and water is then thrown over her head and she starts to scream.

And just as she thinks the challenge is over, another bucket is picked up from the ground and is emptied onto her.

She then starts to shout 'stop' after being drenched by the freezing water. 

She caused a stir on social media last week after vowing to move to England if Scotland votes for independence following last night's bruising TV debate.

Ms Mone said she would take her business to London in the event of a 'Yes' vote in next month's referendum.

Following the TV debate between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling, Ms Mone took to Twitter to slam the dangers of walking away from the UK.

She said an independent Scotland's deficit would be too high and was concerned about losing the pound. 

She was placed on a chair before facing the camera to say that she accepted the challenge 

Ms Mone then squirms as she hears the bucket being picked up behind her 

The ice cubes then start to fall onto her head and she starts to scream 

Ms Mone also attacked the divisive impact of the independence debate after receiving a barrage of abuse from nationalists online. 

Ms Mone, co-owner of MJM International and creator of lingerie brand Ultimo said previously: ‘I will move my business and I will move personally.

‘I don't think we can survive on our own and I think it would be really bad for business.

‘Everything would go up and I really don't think we need it at the moment.’ 

The crowd behind her - many of them using their phones to film her - start to laugh as she is drenched 

After the first bucket is emptied, she puts her head down and wipes her hair back with her hands 

Just as she thought the challenge was over - JT Foxx gets out another bucket and pours it over her head
