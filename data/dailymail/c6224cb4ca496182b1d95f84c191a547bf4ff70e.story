Alfred Tedford, 37, from Houston, is charged with improper photography

A husband is accused of secretly filmed his wife's friend in the shower after allegedly hiding a camera in a pencil box. 

Alfred Tedford, 37, from Houston, is charged with improper photography.

His wife's friend stayed overnight at the couple's home on October 29.

She did not notice anything unusual until the next day when she saw the pencil case after taking a shower and thought it was in a strange place, it is reported.

She found the phone inside, but thought it may belong to her teenager son because children at the home had been playing with it earlier and turned it off, reports Chron.com.

When she turned it on later she was horrified to discover the video of herself in the bathroom.

She told authorities the video also showed Tedford setting up the phone on the counter, records state.

Tedford admitted to authorities that he hid his phone inside the pencil box and put it in the bathroom with the intention of making a video recording of his wife's friend, according to Harris County Sheriff's Office investigators.

He is being held in the Harris County jail on a $2,000 bond.
