Millions of Britons spend most of their lives eating the same seven 'safe meals', according to new research.

A study found a lack of time and confidence plays havoc with the typical person's meal plans, meaning 60 per cent of us eat the same dishes week after week.

One in four adults even cooks the same meal on the same day every week and has a strict rota in place.

One in four Britons say they cook the same meals on the same night of every week, with Lasagne being one of the seven 'safe meals' people return to time and time again, research has shown

Of those, the typical adult has the same meal schedule in place for nearly four years.

But around 13 per cent have eaten the same thing on the same days of the week for 10 years or more.

The survey of the nation's eating habits also found one in five people say that if they haven't planned anything in advance they tend to fall back on a frozen pizza, egg and chips or a take-away.

A spokesman for Old Jamaica Ginger Beer, who commissioned the research, said: 'This study shows we are really lacking imagination when it comes to experimenting with flavours.

Monday: Spaghetti bolognese

Tuesday: Chilli Con Carne

Wednesday: Pork chops

Thursday: Lasagne

Friday: Casserole (pictured below)

Saturday: Stir-fry

Sunday: Roast dinnerÂ 

'Eating the same meals week after week for years on end doesn't sound very appealing, although it's easy to see how we become stuck in a rut.

'Busy lives, long commutes and domestic chores all take their toll and this research shows many adults are falling back on a handful of safe meals and drinks rather than experimenting with new flavours and recipes.'

The company is encouraging people to 'trial new flavours' and 'broaden their culinary horizons.'

Their study found the main reason for a limited repertoire of meals is a lack of time, followed by the cost element of having to buy different ingredients for more lavish meals.

Of the 2,000 adults polled - 27 per cent said they prefer to cook British meals rather than international dishes.

But the study found one in ten Britons lie to their friends and family about the type of meals they prepare in a bid to make themselves sound more adventurous.

And 28 per cent said they often struggle to join in with conversations their peers are having about exotic foods and drinks.

Many people said they would like to cook more adventurously but felt constrained by lack of time and money
