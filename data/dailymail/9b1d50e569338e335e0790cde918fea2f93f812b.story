A photo of the terrorist behind the 9/11 attacks on America has been used by a Turkish cosmetics company to advertise its hair removal products.

The hirsute former Al-Qaeda member Khalid Sheikh Mohammed featured in an advert for Epila hair removal products.

In Turkish, the caption states: 'Waiting won't get rid of that hair.'

The company said they used the militant's picture for 'his hair, not terrorism'.

Mehmet Can Yildiz, a spokesperson for the firm told Hurriyet Daily News: 'We didn't know that he was a terrorist. This image is in popular use in Turkish memes on the internet.

'The guy is quite hairy, so we thought his body was a good fit for our ad.'

The spokesperson added: 'Several popular caps [humourously captioned images] were produced with his photo. Most were related to insomnia. We didn't want to imply anything political.

'We didn't know that it could become an international story.'

The mastermind is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay and could face the death penalty if found guilty.

Last year it emerged that, while confined to the basement of a CIA secret prison in Romania about a decade ago, Mohammed, who had earned his bachelor's in mechanical engineering, asked his jailers whether he could design a vacuum cleaner.

The agency officer in charge of the prison called CIA headquarters and a manager approved the request, a former senior CIA official told The Associated Press.

Mohammed had endured the most brutal of the CIA's harsh interrogation methods, including 183 water boardings, and had confessed to a career of atrocities.
