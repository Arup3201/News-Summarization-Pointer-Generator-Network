A performing Killer Whale suffered a horrific injury which left its jawbone exposed at a SeaWorld theme park, prompting fury from animal rights groups.

Pictures showing Nakai, an 11-year-old whale who performs at the San Diego SeaWorld park, with a large gash to its chin were leaked online by a unnamed whistleblower.

In a statement, SeaWorld said Nakai's injury was caused when it 'came into contact with a portion of the pool environment'.

Jawbone: Pictures released by a SeaWorld whistleblower show the horrific injuries suffered by killer whale Nikai which insiders claim were result of a fight between three whales

Animal welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has submitted a complaint to the US Department of Agriculture accusing the park of housing incompatible killer whales together

However online reports suggest the 
incident happened on September 20 when Nakai got into a fight with two 
other Killer Whales Ike and Keet.

They believe Nakai was either bitten by one of the other whales or smashed into the concrete pool wall.

Journalist
 Tim Zimmermann reported: 'It happened last week during a night show, 
seemingly during a major altercation involving Nakai, Keet, and Ike.

'It’s not clear if there was an aggressor or instigator, or if they all suddenly went after each other.

'In
 response to the altercation, Nakai split to the back pool. The onstage 
trainers, not realizing how badly injured he was, continued the show 
with the other whales.

'It was only when they called Nakai over later that night that they realised he was seriously hurt.'

Animal
 welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has 
submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

They have accused SeaWorld of housing Killer Whales together incompatibly -  a direct violation of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).

Injury: Killer whale Nikai is kept at SeaWorld San Diego. A spokesman for the park said he was injured after hitting the side of the tank

A
 spokesman for the group said: 'The AWA makes it clear that marine 
mammals that are not compatible must not be housed in the same 
enclosure.

'Yet SeaWorld 
parks have a long history of housing incompatible orcas from widely 
divergent groups together in enclosures - and the result has been 
stress, agitation, aggressive and bloody raking, serious injury, and 
death.'

In a 
statement, a spokesman for the park said: 'There is no organisation in 
the world more committed to the physical, social and mental welfare  of 
its animals than SeaWorld.'

Should killer whales be banned from SeaWorld following claims of poor treatment at the park?

They said Nikai is being treated with antibiotics and had been 'swimming comfortably and interacting with other killer whales'.

In February 2010 trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed by six-ton killer whale Tilikum, who is Nikai's father, at SeaWorld's Orlando park.

The six ton whale dragged the 40-year-old into the pool by her pony tail and then thrashed her while she was in the water, as horrified spectators looked on.

Banned: No trainer is allowed in the water with Tilikum because of his size and dangerous history

It was the third death Tilikum had been involved in. In 1991 trainer Keltie Byrne died after slipping and falling into the tank with Tilikum and two other whales.  

In 1999, a man sneaked past security at SeaWorld Orlando and was later found dead, his body draped over Tilikum.

Earlier this year Peta diled a lawsuit against San Diego SeaWorld claiming that the five killer whales at the are treated like slaves because they're forced to live in tanks and perform daily.

The five whales were named as the plaintiffs in the case.

However a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit saying the 13th amendment - which outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude - applies only to humans.
