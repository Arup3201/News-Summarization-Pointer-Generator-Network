A stingray on the Gold Coast showed it was not to be messed with after an aggressive swimmer charged it.

A man was swimming near a large stingray on the beach at Broadwater on the Gold Coast when he decided to dive aggressively toward the sea creature.

The frightened stingray swims away from the man, who then turns to walk back to the shore.

The stingray then sneaks up behind the man who remains oblivious to it until someone off camera calls out to warn him.

The stingray then charged at the man, prompting the man to dive away in fright.

Both the man and the stingray appeared to be unharmed by the encounter.

The one- to two-metre stingray might be an estuary ray, a species common to the area.

Gavin Ball, 27, a Southport local who works at a café near where the animal encounter took place said that stingrays are common in the area.

'If you're out on the pier you see them every day,' he told MailOnline.

The most common stingrays are a smaller variety – 45 to 50 cm – but he says the larger estuary rays are still around, but that someone would have to be an 'idiot' to deliberately provoke them.

In 2006, wildlife conservationist Steve Irwin was killed when a stingray barb punctured his chest while filming a documentary in the Great Barrier Reef.
