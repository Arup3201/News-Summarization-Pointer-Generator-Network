There's an old adage - if you want something done right, do it yourself. Well, that was certainly the case for Grays Athletic player-manager Mark Bentley.   

With his side 2-1 down in the second-half to Hampton and Richmond Borough in the Isthmian League Premier Division, defeat was looking likely. 

Bentley though, wasn't prepared to just stand back and take one; so, in a bold tactical move, the 37-year-old subbed himself into the game, and minutes later, he scored an equalising goal with a header from a corner.

As if that wasn't incredible enough, when the Grays goalkeeper was forced off the field with injury and with no replacement available from the bench, Bentley stepped into his position. 

Amazingly, he managed not to concede, even after his side gave away a clumsy penalty in the 81st minute. Bentley guessed correctly and saved the shot to keep Grays in it at 2-2. 

The Blues would then go on to score a late winner and Bentley has since become a viral sensation.
