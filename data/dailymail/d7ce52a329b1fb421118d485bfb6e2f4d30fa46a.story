The footage, released on Tuesday by Wisconsin police, contains 911 calls from frightened drivers who have been injured.

On the tape, posted on NBC, one caller said that her passenger was bleeding and unconscious and added that her 'face was cut open'. 

Several cars skidded off the road onto a
grass verge while many others crashed as they sped towards the carnage,
unable to stop fast enough in the wintry conditions.

Twelve people were injured, according
to Germantown police, who said they were amazed by the number of 
motorists who remained standing on the road.

The police footage revealed several drivers who had ignored advice to stay in their cars and stepped out to survey the damage

Traffic was backed up for miles following the massive collision on Sunday

Officer
Tim Miller, who was en route to another crash, said: 'If people watch 
Nascar, and they watch the Daytona 500 or Talledega, where they wait for
what’s called the Big Crash, where all the cars crash because they’re 
all so close together, that’s what this was like - only there was nobody
there to stop it with a yellow flag and slow all the other cars down.

'It just kept going and going and going. I mean that’s what was helpless about it,' he told the Inquisitr.

Up to half the motorists fled the scene, while others just stood around on the highway despite being cautioned not to do so.
