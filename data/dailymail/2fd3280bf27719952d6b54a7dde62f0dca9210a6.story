Innocent Palestinian families are being subjected to terrifying night-time raids and mock arrests by the Israeli army without being told they are military exercises, it has emerged.

In one drill earlier this year, around 15 soldiers stormed a family's home in the city of Hebron while they were eating their evening meal during Ramadan.

Wearing helmets and carrying weapons, they used a ladder to enter activist Issa Amro's property from an upstairs window.

They then broke down a neighbour's door before returning to Amro's home for a second exercise in his yard after midnight.

In another drill, a number of troops caused alarm and distress in Amatin, in the northern West Bank, after spreading out through the village for several hours.

'From the responses of those to whom we spoke, they were very afraid â€“ especially children and the elderly,' said Emily Schaeffer, a lawyer for Israeli human rights group Yesh Din, which filed complaints about the two incidents to the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF).

She said the IDF's conduct was 'an unlawful violation of basic rights'.

According to the Guardian, former Israeli soldiers told how civilians with no connection with militant activity were chosen for the drills, with one saying: 'We used houses, streets, people like cardboard practice targets.'

Describing a mock arrest, ex-solder Moran Gonen said: 'You knock on the door, no one opens, you knock harder, the guy comes out, he doesn't understand because there is no reason.

'It's not as if he did anything.'

The IDF admitted the training exercise in Hebron had been conducted 'improperly'.

The military advocate general is also understood to have called for an internal inquiry by the unit over the incident.

Of the drill in Amatin, the IDF said it had been designed to 'acquaint forces more closely with the relevant sector as well as demonstrating IDF presence in the area' .

It said it had been carried out to minimise friction with residents.

In a letter responding to Yesh Din's complaints, the advocate general said the IDF was 'obliged to maintain security and public order' in the West Bank.

'In order to maintain the competence of IDF forces to carry out that mission, the IDF must train, sometimes even in populated areas,' it adds.

But the letter stressed that soldiers 'must avoid endangering the population, causing damage to its property or unreasonably disturbing its living routine'.
