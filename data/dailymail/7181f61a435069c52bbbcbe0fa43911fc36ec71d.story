The Liberal Democrats were accused last night of using public money to garner votes after it emerged that more than 80 per cent of places to benefit from a new fuel subsidy will be in their own seats.

Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander said 17 rural areas would benefit from a 5p a litre cut in fuel duty after a scheme – funded by the British taxpayer – was signed off by the European Commission.

But 14 are in Lib Dem seats, including two in Mr Alexander’s own constituency in the Scottish Highlands.

Labour suggested there should be an inquiry into so-called ‘pork barrel politics’ by the Lib Dems, who also boast of channelling cash for roads and schools to their own seats.

Mr Alexander, MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, has faced repeated claims that he is shoring up votes in his seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere.

In the past, cash has been found for a tax break for ski lifts, a bailout for a sleeper train from London to Scotland and green levies scrapped for a tourist train in the Cairngorms.

In January, Nick Clegg announced plans for a £300million ‘city deal’ for Inverness, including £2million to promote Loch Ness and its mythical monster to tourists.

Shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie suggested the deals should be investigated by the Commons public accounts committee to see if they represent value for money.

Mr Leslie said: ‘While I’m sure there are many living in rural areas who would love a fuel duty cut, it seems more than a coincidence that this is largely restricted to Danny Alexander’s backyard and those of his small band of Lib Dem colleagues.

‘Taken together with the very convenient tax break for his local ski lift, there’s something very fishy about these decisions, and perhaps the public accounts committee ought to investigate.’

Nick Clegg has promised to create a Cornish Assembly in a bid to shore up his party’s vote in the county.

The Deputy Prime Minister (right) made the pledge as he yesterday embarked on a tour of the key Lib Dem battleground.

The party is desperately trying to avoid a wipeout in the county where it once held all six seats. Currently, three of the area’s MPs are Lib Dems.

Mr Clegg said that he would create a Cornish Assembly, similar to that in Wales, which could allow the Cornish to choose different rules to the rest of England in areas potentially relating to second home ownership and bus services.

But the plans dismissed as ‘ill-considered’ and a ‘nonsense’ by Cornish nationalists.

Mr Clegg said: ‘When the Cornish Assembly is born, it would be up to those who are elected to shape Cornwall’s destiny. 

'We could change planning law and council tax so buying up second homes in Cornwall comes with a greater price.’

Nine areas benefiting from the new ‘rural fuel rebate’ are in the Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency of former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy who is facing a desperate fight with the SNP to hang on to his seat.

Two are in Mr Alexander’s seat, and another two are in the constituency of his Lib Dem neighbour John Thurso.

Another beneficiary is Lynton, North Devon, in the constituency of former Lib Dem defence minister Sir Nick Harvey, and one of only four seats in England to benefit. Others are in Cumbria, Northumberland and North Yorkshire.

Mr Alexander said the move will help up to 125,000 people in areas faced with some of the highest fuel prices in the country.

It is the first time the European Union has approved a fuel discount for people living on the UK mainland.

Currently, islanders off the coast of Scotland and in the Isles of Scilly are eligible for a 5p discount on petrol and diesel because the cost of transporting fuel there means pump prices are much higher. The scheme will be extended to 17 mainland areas at the end of May.

A source close to Mr Alexander denied the scheme was designed to favour Lib Dem seats. He said the selection process had been ‘evidence-based’.

‘This is testament to how hard Danny has fought and campaigned on this issue over many years,’ he said.

‘Danny represents a rural community with many remote areas and so he knows first-hand the extra financial burden this puts on families and businesses facing high fuel costs while relying on cars to travel long distances.’
