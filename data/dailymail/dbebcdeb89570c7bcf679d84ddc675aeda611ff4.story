A Manhattan trader jumped in front of a commuter train on Tuesday morning - the 11th person working in finance to commit suicide this year.

Edmund or Eddie Reilly, 47, who worked at Vertical Group in Midtown New York City, ended his own life when he threw himself in front of a Long Island Rail Road train at 6am near the Syosset station.

First responders declared him dead at the scene and his identity was confirmed a LIRR spokesman who added that an investigation had begun.

Witnesses to the tragic death said that they saw a man standing alongside the tracks outside the station before he leapt into the path of the train.

'Eddie was a great guy,' said Vertical Group managing director Rob Schaffer to The New York Post.

'We are very upset and he will be deeply missed.'

Reilly had divorced his wife and mother of his three children, Michelle Reilly and had moved to a home around the corner from them.

A family friend, who spoke to the trader on Sunday, told The Post that Reilly 'didnâ€™t look good.'
