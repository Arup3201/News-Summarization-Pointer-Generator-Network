The hot weather has been blamed for a host of travel problems - from tarmac melting, to train tracks buckling.

But now it would appear that Britain's heatwave has caused planes to become 'too heavy' to take off.

Safety concerns about the plane taking off has led to passengers being blocked from boarding their plane, and in some cases passengers are being forced to disembark to lighten the load.

London City Airport is allegedly suffering more than others because it has a smaller runway, and in hot weather planes need more time to take off

Passengers were removed from a Swiss flight between London City Airport and Geneva on Sunday, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The airport is allegedly suffering more than others because it has a smaller runway, and in the hot weather planes need a longer amount of time to take off.

Because warm air is less dense than cold air, subsequently there are fewer air molecules in a given volume of warm air than in the same volume of cooler air.

As temperature and humidity rises, the air becomes less dense, and therefore the air creates less lift for the airplane.

'As a result, on a hot day, an airplane will require more runway to take off, will have a poor rate of climb and a faster approach and will experience a longer landing roll,' Pilot Friend explained.

On Sunday, 15 passengers were asked to disembark a Swiss Airlines flight out of London City Airport because the plane was too heavy to take off, Opodo reported.Â 

'Due to weather conditions, the take-off weight of the aircraft had to be reduced due to safety reasons,' a spokesman for Swiss told the Telegraph.

'In very high temperatures it usually takes longer until the aircraft can actually take-off, and since London City Airport has a short airstrip the take-off weight needed to be reduced,' they said.

However, a spokesman for the airport said that the heat had not caused any airplanes to be grounded, and suggested that the plane was overweight.

A spokesman for City Airport said: 'City Airport is a STOLport (short take off and landing) but very little stops the planes that are certified to fly in and out of here doing so - and hot weather isn't one of those factors.

'Sounds like the plane was overweight, pure and simple - something that happens to all planes at all airports regardless of runway size.'

Larger airports, like Gatwick and Heathrow, have far longer runways, giving the planes the time and length they need to safely take off.

The hot weather which has grounded planes shows no sign of abating.

This month has been the hottest and driest July on record since 2006, forecasters have confirmed.And while the prolonged hot spell will continue to peter out as temperatures slump to normal levels, the UK can look forward to one more scorcher with the mercury set to soar to 32C.

Temperatures could even top that level in the south - making it the hottest August day in a decade.
