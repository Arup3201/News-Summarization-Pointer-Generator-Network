A teacher has denied she had a six-month sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student which started through social networking.

Math
teacher Marie Johnson, 41, from Livermore, California, was arrested and
booked on 24 counts of sexual assault charges last month.

Authorities
believe a sexual relationship started in December 2010 until May 2011, with 
most incidents taking place in the teacher's car.

Arrested: Marie Johnson, 41, has been accused of having sexual relations with a student over a six-month period - but she has denied the claims

The boy is said to be a former student of Johnson's, who has been a math teacher for 13 years, at Granada High School.

She was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under 18, oral copulation and committing a lewd act on a child.

But she entered a not guilty plea on Thursday in Alameda County Superior Court in Pleasanton.

According to the San Francisco 
Chronicle, the relationship between Johnson and the boy started through 
text messages, Facebook and instant messaging through the smart phone 
game, Words with Friends.

Scene: The teen was at Granada High School when the alleged sexual assaults took place. He told his coach he was a victim of 'repeated molestation'

On January 10, the boy told a coach at his school that 'he was a victim of repeated molestation,' police Detective Joseph Draghi wrote in a statement.

The boy, who is now 15, 'provided a detailed statement of a long-term sexual relationship with Johnson,' Draghi wrote.

Police are advising parents to talk to their children about the episode.

Police officer Steve Goard said: 'We don't think that there are other victims, but we're not ruling that out, being that she's a teacher and has had access to kids throughout the years.'

Wooing: The relationship was initially formed via text messages, Facebook and through instant messaging on the smartphone app Words with Friends

Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District Superintendent Kelly Bowers said Johnson was placed on administrative leave .

She said: 'As always, while following due process guidelines, if we discover that any adult or staff member has placed a student at risk, we take appropriate, swift and decisive action. Safety of our students is our top priority.'

Johnson is being held at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin on $950,000 bail.
