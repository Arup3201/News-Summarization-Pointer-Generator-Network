Earlier this week, it emerged that Kim Kardashian - who usually has no problem sharing intimate details of her life, and her bottom, with the digital world - has reportedly banned the use of social media at her wedding to fiance Kanye West this weekend.

But according to a new survey conducted by David's Bridal, it seems most brides-to-be consider this embargo to be a little excessive, with only 14 per cent of U.S. brides planning to completely ban the use of social media on their wedding days.

Of those questioned, almost half of the 
brides-to-be agreed that regardless of their own stance, setting 
'digital rules' ahead of their nuptials is an important consideration.

Banned?  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West (pictured this morning in Paris) may be forbidding guests from using social media at their wedding - but a new study has found that only 14 per cent of brides-to-be will do the same

Fifty-eight per cent believe the bride and groom should be the first to post a photo, and 62 per cent agreed that bridesmaids should not post any photos of the bride in her dress ahead of the ceremony - which seems obvious enough.

A minority of those questioned, only 26 per cent, say they were likely to encourage a specially-created hashtag to amalgamate the avid postings of their guests, a method employed by Big Bang star Kaley Cuoco at her wedding.

Ms Cuoco, who married husband Ryan 
Sweeting on New Year's Eve, created the #thesweetings hashtag, and the 
first wedding photo she shared garnered more than 48,000 'likes' from 
her fans.

Failed attempt: Chloe Delevingne (left) originally claimed her sister Poppy (center) was banning guests from 'posting pictures' at her high society wedding, but the bride herself and countless guests shared inside snaps anyway

Intimate details: Supermodel Cara Delevingne managed to mostly keep a lid on it at the wedding last weekend, but for this snap (pictured) which she shared with her five million-strong pack of Instagram followers

And as people all over the planet rely more and more on social media to keep in touch with their loved ones from afar, 36 per cent of brides surveyed said that live-streaming their nuptials or integrating Skype would be 'a nice touch' for those who can't make it for the big occasion.

How does long does it take for newly married brides to change their 'status' on social media?

For a majority of them, not very long. Fifty-six per cent of brides will adopt their new married names on social media the very same day of the wedding.

For all to see: Actress Kaley Cuoco (pictured with new husband Ryan Sweeting) created the hashtag #thesweetings to bring all the social media postings together on her wedding, like this photo shared by Kaley's 'dog' on Instagram

Hush Hush: Some celebrity couples, including Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford (left) and Leighton Meester and Adam Brody (right) kept their weddings so off the grid, many didn't even know they were married for weeks

According to The Daily Star,
 the reality TV star is issuing a contract than 'bans guests from 
uploading anything on social media, taking pictures and even talking 
about the big day with friends and family who werenâ€™t invited to the 
wedding.'

It will interesting to see whether the couple Mr West will be able to contain their over-sharing urges on their big day, as they have apparently planned.

British model and socialite Poppy Delevingne, who married her long-time partner James Cook over the weekend, were said to be implicating the same ban.

'Poppy and James want it to be private, and no one can post any pictures,' the brides older sister, Chloe Delevingne, informed MailOnline before the wedding.

That rule was clearly an epic failure, with Poppy herself, her supermodel sister Cara Delevingne, and pretty much the rest of the wedding party uploading photos throughout the day.

Some stars on the other hand have kept themselves so unplugged, Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford or Leighton Meister and Adam Brody for example, that it was weeks before anyone even knew they had married.

For most of us however, megawatt celebrity or otherwise, the simple truth is that it's near impossible to escape the presence of social media, especially on one of the most important days of your life.
