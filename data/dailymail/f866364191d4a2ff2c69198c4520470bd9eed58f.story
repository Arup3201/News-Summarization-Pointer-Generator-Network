A BT worker strangled a married colleague during a lunch break and then killed himself after she refused to start an intimate relationship with him, an inquest heard today.

Darren Hunt, 43, killed fellow IT professional Beverley Farrow, 31, as she lay on a bed at his home before hanging himself in his garage.

Police broke in and found the pair dead on the night of December 8 last year after Mrs Farrow's husband Daniel returned home with their young son and found her missing.

Killed: Beverley Farrow was strangled by Darren Hunt after she refused to have an affair with him, an inquest heard

Det Chief Insp John Brocklebank of Suffolk Police told how Mrs Farrow and Hunt both worked at BT's research headquarters in Martlesham, near Ipswich, Suffolk.

He told the hearing in Ipswich that the pair were friends, but he added: 'Darren wanted a more intimate relationship with Beverley. There’s clear evidence that she did not.'

Hunt, who was nicknamed Daz, was found hanging with a bottle of whisky lying nearby in his garage at his rented home in Walker Chase on the Grange Farm estate in Kesgrave, near Ipswich.

A note which is believed to have been written by Hunt was found next to her body. It said: 'Sorry world, and those who tried to help me. Sorry Ma, it’s not your fault.'

The note also said he 'never could get the hang of Thursdays'. He was found dead on a Thursday.

Mr Brocklebank said Hunt had purchased 'an item capable of being used for restraint' the day before the pair were found dead.

He said the cause of Mrs Farrow's death had been 'compression of the neck' and that there was bruising to her forearms and wrists consistent with being restrained.

Det Supt Brocklebank added: 'No evidence has been found Beverley Farrow intended to take her own life. To the contrary, she had everything to live for.'

He said despite extensive investigation into emails and mobile telephone records, there was no evidence the pair had 'anything other than a close friendship'.

Tragic: Mrs Farrow and Mr Hunt worked together at the BT research centre

On the day the pair died, Mrs Farrow had sent a message to her husband telling him she was having a lunch break with Hunt.

The inquest heard how Mr Farrow tried to contact his wife and Hunt on their mobile phones without success after finding she was not at their home in Jennings Drift, Kesgrave.

He then went to Hunt's home in a cul de sac around half a mile away, but was unable to get a response and called police at around 8.40pm.

Officers used a crow bar to break into the garage after seeing a light on inside and then brown a door to get into the house.

Greater Suffolk Coroner Dr Peter Dean said: 'It is difficult to think of circumstances more devastating than this.'

Gathering evidence: Police remained at the home for several days sifting for evidence

He recorded a verdict that Mrs Farrow was unlawfully killed and that Hunt took his own life.

A statement from Mrs Farrow's family said: 'She was a beautiful, sweet natured person who liked everyone and would harm no-one.

'She was a beautiful, sweet, darling wife, a fantastic, natural mum who loved dancing, rolling around and having fun with her son, with whom she had a truly special bond.

'We cannot express how devastated we are over the loss of Bev, who was so cruelly taken from us. Our lives have been turned upside down and will never be the same.'
