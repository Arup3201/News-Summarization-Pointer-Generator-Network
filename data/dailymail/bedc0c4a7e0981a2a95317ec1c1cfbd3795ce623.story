The world's greatest rodeo bull is finally hanging up his flank strap after a five-year career that has seen just one cowboy stay on him for longer than eight seconds.

Meet Bushwacker, an 1,700-pound American Bucking Bull. He is also known as King of the Bulls.

The eight-year-old is so well-respected in his homeland of North Carolina that he is embarking on a ten-city testimonial retirement tour to give his fans a chance to say goodbye... and see him buck just one last time.

Indeed, his legend is such that, on Saturday, any Professional Bull Riders cowboy will earn a $25,000 bonus if he can stay on board Bushwacker for the required eight 
seconds.

'Cool as a cat': The eight-year-old, 1,700-pound beast has all but one of the 57 cowboys brave enough to ride him. But outside the bullring, he's known as a very cool customer

Then, on March 1, he will take center stage at the Iron Cowboy V event at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the winner of which will be awarded $1million.

'I want him to be known as the greatest bull ever, and I don't want 
to go two, three years down the road and let him tire,' owner Julio Moreno, 60, told the Los Angeles Times. 'To
 retire him at the top of his game, like the great racehorse Secretariat
 … that last vision of him should be of him at his best.'

Bushwacker, who travels the country in a $50,000 trailer that he bought himself, was World Champion in 2010, 2011 and 2013 and was runner-up 2012.

To 'win' at bull riding, cowboys have to stay on for a minimum of eight seconds with just a braided rope tied round the bull called the 'flank strap' to hold on to.

The ride is then scored from 0–100 points. Both the rider and the bull are awarded points.

But there is just one rider out of 57 who, in the past five years, has managed to stay on board Bushwacker for eight seconds.

'I was 10 feet tall and bulletproof when it was over,' pro cowboy J B Mauney told the LA Times. 'It's a bull everyone was scared of, said couldn't be rode. I rode him.'

What separates Bushwacker from other bulls is not that he is strong but that he's smart, says Mauney.

'His signature is that his first jump out of the chute is long 
[measured at eight yards],' says Mauney who was thrown by Bushwacker in their 11 previous showdowns. 'Most bulls, when they rear up in the air, 
they come straight back down and kick over their head. Him, he goes 
forward and up at the same time and then he breaks and kicks.'

While Mauney says the two are now friends of sorts, he knows never to get too near to the beast when posing for pictures - even after they've won a prize.

Fearsome: Bull riding is known as the most dangerous eight seconds in sport

Moreno says anyone other than one handler will get 'smashed' or 'thrown 
over the fence' for trying to pet the grumpy animal.

But when it's time for business, Bushwacker is well known as a true professional.

'He doesn't try to lean against the gate or cheat in any way like 
other bulls do,' veteran PBR cowboy Frank Newsome told the paper. 'Stands square, right in the middle of 
the chute, lets you get your rope pulled as tight as you want it. To be 
that cool and that rank is unique.'

And when he's thrown whichever rider is foolish enough to try him out to the ground, he doesn't trample them or gore them with his horns... he just runs back into his pen, ready for another round.

He doesn't like people much either, says Moreno. Instead he like nothing more than to dig up dirt with his hoof in his pen and snort to his heart's content.
