Russia's deputy prime minister has tweeted a picture mocking Barack Obama's masculinity just days after the U.S. president announced a fresh wave of sanctions against the country.

Dmitry Rogozin uploaded an image of Russian president Vladimir Putin posing with a leopard alongside an image of Obama holding a white poodle.

The peculiar display of one-upmanship was captioned 'We have different values ​​and allies,' making it clear what the Kremlin thinks of the U.S. president and his Western counterparts amid heightened tensions following the shooting down of flight MH17 in Ukraine, which left 298 people dead.

Mockery: Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin uploaded this image of Russian president Vladimir Putin posing with a leopard alongside an image of Obama holding a white poodle

Macho: Rogozin's image is the latest attempt by Russian officials to present Putin as an ultra-manly figure. He has previously posed for staged photographs topless on horseback

Rogozin's image has so far been retweeted more than 1,000 times and is the latest attempt by Russian officials to present Putin as an ultra-manly figure.

He has previously posed for staged photographs topless on horseback, swimming at sea, embracing a polar bear and hang-gliding with migratory birds.

The image of his posing with a snow leopard is believed to have been taken during a visit to a sanctuary in the run-up to the Sochi Winter Olympics last year.

The photograph of Obama, meanwhile, is understood to have been taken in the mid-2000s when he was campaigning to become Senator of Illinois.

It is not the first time Rogozin has taken to social media to defend his country's might.

Earlier he tweeted a short YouTube documentary on the history of the Russian-made Ural tank.

Tough guy: Vladimir Putin has long been keen to show off his physical prowess as well as his political strength

Obama himself, meanwhile, is not exactly the most popular in the U.S., with his approval rating close to an all-time low in the crucial Ohio swing state.

In many Democrat-voting areas of U.S. he is now seen as a less-popular figure than potential presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, amid anger over his domestic policies on illegal immigration, health care and gun control.

He has also been criticised for being more concerned about his celebrity image than foreign policy and was accused of 'partying while the world burns' when hosting a Katy Perry concert at the White House last night.

As violence intensifies in Gaza, ISIS militants continue their brutal campaign in Iraq and Syria, and tensions with Russia reach Cold War levels, Obama introduced the pop star on stage with the words 'I love Katy Perry. She is just a wonderful person... for her to take time out to do this is really special.'

Winning mentality: Putin is a fan of judo and often arranges photo shoots where he will take on and occasionally beat professional athletes

It has also claimed they provided the BUK suface-to-air missile launcher that down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in the state of Donetsk on July 18, killing all 298 people on board.

Today it was announced that Russia will impose import duties on products from Moldova and its latest move to limit trade with the former Soviet republic, which signed an EU free-trade deal in June.

Russia is currently Moldova's third-largest export market after the European Union and Ukraine.

The Russian government today said import duties at 'Most Favoured Nation' rates will be introduced for Moldova on August 30, covering products such as meat, vegetables, sugar and wine.

Under the regime, Russia applies basic import duties to products from countries that are not members of its free trade zone and do not enjoy any other preferences.

Moldova currently supplies products to Russia with a zero duty, according to their agreement.

The move follows Russia's decision to suspend imports of fruit and limit meat imports from Moldova after the country of 3.5 million - one of Europe's poorest states - signed the free-trade and political cooperation agreement with the EU.
