The body of a young mother of four, has been found in St. Tammany, Louisiana, five days after her boyfriend was arrested following an armed standoff with deputies.

Melinda Denny, 26, from Mobile, Alabama, was last seen with her boyfriend, Jonathon Nall, 34, around 1:30 a.m. on Saturday morning in a parking lot on Highway 21.

The pair were supposed to be traveling from Mobile to Texas, when Nall's mom informed cops that they were stranded in the parking lot without gas or the money to buy any.

When police searched their red 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee they found a gun, but no ammunition. The pair were allowed to go on their way after a routine check revealed neither had any criminal history.

Approximately 10 hours later Nall was arrested after he threatened to commit suicide during a stand-off with deputies outside a gas station along I-12 near Madisonville.

Nall was eventually taken into custody after deputies fired a round of bean bags, striking him in the chest.

‘Nall suffered no significant injuries from the bean bag; however, he was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, where he remains today under an order of protective custody,’ said deputies.

Jonathan Nall, 34, is bipolar and was arrested on Saturday after he threatened to commit suicide during a stand-off with deputies outside a gas station along I-12

Video footage of Nall's stand-off with deputies on Saturday morning was taken by Bruce Primes and posted on Facebook

Denny wasn't seen during Nall's confrontation with authorities and she wasn't found later when deputies located Nall's jeep Grand Cherokee.

It took until Thursday morning and a sweep of the local area by 150 deputies that Denny’s body was discovered in an open field. 

Denny died from multiple stab wounds, said the St. Tammany Parish Coroner's Office.

Sheriff Jack Strain told WWLTV that he is confident the case will ultimately lead to the arrest of Nall.

'This guy did a big show of his apparent mental problems, but now it’s up to the professionals to decide was that a disguise or truly mental incapacity,' said Strain.

He added that Nall had cooperated enough to help lead to Thursday's discovery.

Nall is in the St. Tammany Parish Jail facing charges related to the public suicide attempt. The sheriff’s office has not announced any new charges at this time.

Video footage of Nall's stand-off with deputies on Saturday morning has also surfaced on Facebook.

Jade Primes Smith, who identified her father Bruce as the man who captured the terrifying standoff, posted the video on Facebook on Saturday.

'He was pumping gas and the man walked up with a gun to his head asking my dad to record it,' she said of her father.

In the footage, Nall is seen pointing a gun at his head outside a Madisonville gas station, while he  rants about the government and 
threatens to kill himself.

His mother has spoken out following the incident and said her son was a father of two who suffers from bipolar disorder.

She suspects that he and Denny had taken drugs directly before he had his episode.

'He says, "they are coming. We have to get out of there. They're coming." Basically, that they were coming to execute him,' she told WWLTV.
