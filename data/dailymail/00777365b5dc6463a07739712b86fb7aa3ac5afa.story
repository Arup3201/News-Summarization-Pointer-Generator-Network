Inter Milan Under 19 starlet Demetrio Steffe scored an incredibly skilful chip in his side's emphatic 6-0 win against rivals AC Milan.

Steffe raced onto a lobbed pass from his Inter Milan team-mate which allowed him a clear run on goal.

However Steffe decided to be incredibly creative instead of simply controlling the ball before running through on goal.

In the net: Steffe's effort landed in the net to the delight of the young midfielder

He instead kept the ball in the air by taking two touches before lobbing the oncoming goalkeeper.

The 18-year-old will be hoping his outstanding goal will be brought to the attention of the club's senior manager Walter Mazzarri.

Steffe spent the entire 2013/14 season on loan at AC Chievo Verona.
