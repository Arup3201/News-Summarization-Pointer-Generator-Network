During the incident, which happened at around 9.20pm and was filmed on a mobile phone,  the younger man retaliates by punching him six times in the head, before kicking him in the face.

Other passengers can be heard urging the pair to stop, saying ‘Oi, listen man, leave it out', ‘Woah hang on’ and 'calm down', reported the London Evening Standard.
