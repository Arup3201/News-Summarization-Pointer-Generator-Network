She grew up in a tough neighbourhood in Chicago and earned her keep singing on Disney cruise ships. But Jennifer Hudson's world was turned upside down after competing on American Idol in 2004 and she hasn't looked back since.

She now has an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a Grammy and over a million album sales under her belt and she still can't quite believe it.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with Net-a-porter's digital magazine, The Edit, she said: 'I didn’t know what the Oscars was…where we come from, we don’t know anything about that world. If you see it on TV, it’s like, "Oh, people in fancy suits and ties”.   

A-list: Jennifer Hudson has crafted a stellar career for herself in the ten years since she competed on American Idol. She IS The Edit's cover star this week

'It is so bizarre to me to say, "OK, let me go email Beyoncé, let me go talk to Oprah..."

'For so long I sat and admired them; now I’m among them.'

Dubbed 'phenomenally talented' by close friend Alicia Keys, the 32-year-old compares her unprecedented success to losing weight.

'It’s one thing to lose it, but it’s 
another to keep it off. Well, it’s one thing to make it, but it’s 
another thing to stay. [That is] why you have to constantly do stuff to 
keep people’s attention. It’s a hustle, it really is,' she said.

Biggest loser: Hudson attracted a lot of attention her dramatic weight loss, which has inspired women worldwide

Hudson, who starred as Effie White in Dreamgirls alongside superstar Beyoncé, reminisces about co-star Jamie Foxx telling her that she was set to win an Oscar for her role - she went on to do just that.

She then landed a coveted role as Sarah Jessica Parker's assistant, Louise, in the Sex and the City movie.

And the future looks set to be just as bright. Next up for Hudson is a film called Black Nativity, which will see her combine her acting and musical talents playing a struggling single mother.

Hudson also attracted a lot of attention for her dramatic weightloss, which has inspired women worldwide.

'It is still very fresh in my mind, being a plus-size girl in Hollywood. Now fittings are so much more fun,' she said.

While she is living the Hollywood dream, Hudson can never forget the tragedy she faced in 2008 when her mother was killed by her sister’s estranged husband - but she won't let the negativity define her and still has an optimistic outlook on life ahead.

Hudson knew from a young age that she was destined to succeed. She recalls her cousin asking her, 'What you gonna do when you get married?' to which Hudson replied, 'I am going to be rich and have maids and cooks.'

Even now, she remarks that at the time she was 'dead serious.'

And in ten short years, she's proved how determined she really was.
