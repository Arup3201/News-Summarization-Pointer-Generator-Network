Two new species of spider, nicknamed Skeletorus and Sparklemuffin, have been discovered by researchers.

Discovered in Queenstown, Australia, the creatures are new species of peacock spider.

The spiders are given the moniker ‘peacock’ for their bright colours and also the bizarre dancing rituals that they use to attract mates.

Two new species of spider have been discovered in Queenstown, Australia. They have been nicknamed Skeletorus and Sparklemuffin (pictured) for their odd looks. The former has a multi-coloured 'fan' that it uses to attract females, and both have a bizarre dancing ritual

The discovery was made in southeast Queensland by graduate student Madeline Girard from the University of California, Berkeley.

Scientists have suggested that golden orb-web spiders may be able to ‘count’.

The arachnids create ‘prey larders’ of victims trapped in their webs and it appears that they are able to keep track of how many meals they have left.

Scientists observed that the spiders search for missing prey when it is taken from their webs.

Golden orb-web spiders (Nephila clavipes) wait for prey to fly into their webs, but dead insects are sometimes stolen from their sticky nets by other spiders.

Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee controlled the number of prey items in the spiders’ ‘larders’ by giving them mealworm larvae and taking them away again.

They discovered that the arachnids search for them if they are removed from their web. 

The scientific names of Sparklemuffin and Skeletorus are Maratus jactatus and Maratus sceletus respectively, but they were given the nicknames for their colourful appearances.

Sparklemuffin has blue and red stripes on its abdomen, while Skeletorus has white stripes across its whole body - making it look a bit like a skeleton.

Jürgen Otto, an entomologist who specialises in photographing the arachnids and who co-authored the report, told Live Science that Skeletorus looked ‘dramatically different [from] all other peacock spiders known to date, making me think that this group is perhaps much more diverse than we had thought’.

At just 0.1 to 0.3 inches (three to seven millimetres) in length, the spiders are very small.

Aside from their colour, though, the most intriguing thing about them is the odd mating dance they perform.

The males display a flap-like body part called a fan, which is patterned with the stripes, while performing a routine to attract a mate.

They also move from one leg to the other, to make themselves more prominent.

‘Positions may be switched 10 times in a 20 second interval, with only about one second or less of display in a single position,’ the researchers explain about Skeletorus in their report.

‘The fan is prominently elevated and often waggled from side to side during this display, but the greatest and most rapid movement is that of the extended spinnerets, separately twitched from side to side.

‘During display, the pedipalps are often moved up and down in front of the clypeus and chelicerae.

‘One leg is elevated but also flexed, displaying a prominent black stripe with little significant movement.’
