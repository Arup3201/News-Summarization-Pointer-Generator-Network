Catalonians live for the weekend, which means that a Friday or Saturday night out lasts well into the following day - and beyond.

For some peace and quiet in the mornings, the lofty Hotel Arts on the seafront keeps you away from the throng, but is still only a pleasant 40-minute walk from the historical centre.

What’s more, the neatly curved, man-made beaches, crafted for the 1992 Olympics, are right on your doorstep.

Up all night to get arty: Barcelona is a city that treats the idea of sleep as an optional extra

This formerly edgy industrial area has 
responded brilliantly to the ultimate facelift. Promenade along the 
waterfront on a Sunday and there are beach volleyball matches, surfers, 
roller skaters, families looking their best, food stalls and a feeling 
of festivity.

Further along is the attractive old fishing village, La Barceloneta.

This triangle of streets was built on land reclaimed from the sea in the 18th century. It’s now a buzzing area and a good spot for a cerveza (beer) in a local bar.

Right next door is El Born, the famously hippy cultural enclave, where you can buy elegant jewellery from Spanish designer Helena Rohner, visit the Picasso Museum or admire the Gothic cathedral.

The latter 13th-century wonder draws crowds who wander the vaulted interior with iPads before them like holy visions. I even see a monk snapping away with a digital SLR.

The ceiling is misty with incense from the morning service, and the dark drama of the interior is enough to keep you on the straight and narrow.

So, too, is the curious Frederic Mares Museum around the corner. This cavernous place, with a collection to rival the ultimate hoarder, is almost deserted. The first floor is given over to wooden crucifixes — an arresting sight. Then there are combs, cigarette cards, crowns, lanterns, ceramics, gold plates, pocket watches, canes, reliquaries and more. It is not for everyone.

But Frederic Mares, a Barcelonian sculptor and a man of voracious energy who travelled widely, must have had deep pockets.

A calmer option is the Picasso Museum. His avant-garde work is well known, but it is fascinating to see the early talent of the teenage painter. The museum is (unfashionably) arranged chronologically - and, as a result, is brilliant.

The portrait of his father, painted in 1896 when Picasso would have been 15, is a sensitive masterwork. Then there are the attractive pastel landscapes which mark his time in Horta de Sant Joan, a village south-west of Barcelona; and the pigeon series (really), painted in 1957 in the South of France, and reminiscent of Matisse’s bright, patterned works.

While on Barcelona’s artistic greats, it would be inconceivable to leave out the wildly imaginative Antonio Gaudi. His Sagrada Familia cathedral - set for completion in 2026 - is covered in cranes. But if you want to see a complete building, La Pedrera is the other favourite.

We arrive early and are rewarded by no queues.

People live in this curvaceous apartment building that is astonishing in its attention to detail and every bit as art nouveau as the sadly damaged Glasgow School of Art.

Barcelona's waterfront was transformed from industrial zone to urban beach in time for the 1992 Olympics

The roof is like a surrealist desert painting by Giorgio de Chirico, and the interior is filled with lovely things - from a retro phone to specially designed floor tiles.

The other great Barcelona tradition - aside from tapas - is brunch. You can snack in the Boqueria, the indoor food market that sells razor clams by the bushel, cured meat on a stick and freshly squeezed juices. Or make a day of it at the Hotel Arts - where it’s a five-course extravaganza - including cuttlefish risotto and eggs benedict followed by a deep snooze.

It is nice to see families getting together with everyone turned out beautifully. The Catalonians have the right idea — the weekend should be savoured.
