A man thought to be a campaigner for Fathers 4 Justice has been charged with criminal damage after a picture of a boy was stuck to one of the country’s most famous paintings.

Paul Douglas Manning, 57, from Sheffield, was arrested yesterday after a photograph was stuck to the canvas of John Constable's The Hay Wain at the National Gallery.

He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today where he was bailed to appear at Southwark Crown Court on July 12.

The incident comes two weeks after a man, also linked to Fathers 4 Justice, was accused of defacing a portrait of the Queen at Westminster Abbey.

In
 a statement it said it was a ‘final act of desperation’ after a man 
lost a final appeal in the High Court over custody rights to his son.

Gallery
 curators said there was ‘no lasting damage’ to the painting, which was 
completed by Constable in 1821 and shows a hay cart crossing the River 
Stour near Flatford Mill in Suffolk.

A National Gallery spokesman 
said: ‘No damage to Constable’s original paint occurred and there is no 
lasting damage to the painting.

'We are currently investigating this with the police.’

The painting was due to be put back on display today, she added.

Separately,
 a court was told yesterday that a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner caused 
up to £10,000 worth of damage when he allegedly defaced a portrait of 
the Queen at Westminster Abbey.

Tim Haries, 41, from Doncaster, is 
accused of daubing the artwork, created for the Diamond Jubilee, with 
the word ‘help’ after smuggling spray paint into the Abbey on June 13.

The £160,000 painting, called The Coronation Theatre, had only been on show for two weeks.

Haries is due to stand trial after 
indicated a plea of not guilty to one count of criminal damage at 
Southwark Crown Court yesterday.

Fathers
 4 Justice yesterday called on fathers to take direct action ‘to defend 
themselves and the 1,000 families a week destroyed in the secret family 
courts’.

It also said it was refusing to deal with the national media because of ‘inaccurate and misleading reporting’ of its campaign.
