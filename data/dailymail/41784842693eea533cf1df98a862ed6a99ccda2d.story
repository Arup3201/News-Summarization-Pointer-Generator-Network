Albert Hickman was convicted of raping the girl in the 1970s, while his wife Carolee (pictured together outside an earlier court hearing) was found guilty of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape

A couple who used 'black magic' to force an 11-year-old schoolgirl to take part in sex sessions have been found guilty of historical sex offences.

Albert John Hickman, 65, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, was convicted of raping the girl between 1972 and 1975 at the couple's former home in Athan near Cardiff.

His wife, Carolee, 64, was found guilty of indecently assaulting the schoolgirl and aiding and abetting rape.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how she held the schoolgirl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, down by the arms while her husband repeatedly raped her.

She also told the victim that she was part of a powerful witches' coven and had a special 'bejewelled knife' which she used to cut her victim's thumb before sucking her blood, the court heard.

The pair also talked to the girl about black magic and did tarot card readings, the jury was told.  

The couple were found guilty by a majority verdict yesterday after the jury deliberated for five hours.

As Judge Daniel Williams remanded the pair in custody, Carolee sobbed into her hand and shouted 'No!' from across the courtroom.

Her husband loudly protested as he was taken down to the cells.

Both Carolee and former RAF man Albert, who were previously jailed for five years for sex abuse, had denied the charges.

The victim, now in her 50s, said she had blocked out memories of the abuse for almost four decades until they came back during counselling for bereavement and depression in 2011.

She earlier told the court that she went to the couple's home, aged 11, but was soon being terrified into submission.

She said: 'Carolee said she was a witch and would come and get me and would make my mother ill.

'She even said she could kill my mother if she wanted to.

'She had a knife with a jewelled handle kept in a wooden box with carvings on the top.

'She cut my hand and sucked the blood out of it.

'There were tarot cards, she used to tell our fortunes and she even had a black cape.'

The victim said she and friends visited Carolee because she would allow them to smoke and even drink while her husband was away working.

'I was on the bed when she held my arms while he [Albert Hickman] raped me,' she said.

Cardiff Crown Court (above) heard how Carolee, 64, used 'black magic' to force the girl into submission while her husband repeatedly raped her. The pair were found guilty by jury and will be sentenced in January

The court was told how Carolee laughed out loud when police asked if she was a witch.

'I've got books on spells but I wouldn't know how to do them - I wouldn't know where to start', she told police officers conducting interviews with her.

A large number of books on spells and the occult were found when officers arrested the pair at their home in Shropshire.

Carolee said she had no idea of the identity of the woman now making the complaint and did not recognise her when shown photographs taken when the victim was young.

Her husband, who described his abuse of other girls in a way that prosecuting counsel Michael Jones described as 'chilling', had denied the rape charge.

The couple, who divorced in 1985 but have since remarried, were remanded in custody ahead of a sentencing hearing in January.
