She is one of the fastest long-distance runners in the United States.

But at the end of every race, 18-year-old Kayla Montgomery collapses, crying for help, unable to feel her legs.

She has Multiple Sclerosis.

Incredible: Kayla Montgomery, 18, cannot feel her legs when she runs because she has Multiple Sclerosis

Debilitating: She collapses at the end of every race, begging for water and ice to cool her body down

The degenerative disease damages nerve endings, which disrupts communication between the body and brain, resulting in loss of muscle control.

As Kayla's body warms up, her legs fall completely numb.

It is not until she covers her body in ice and cold water that her symptoms subside.

Incredibly, that doesn't stop her from competing in national level tournaments, as revealed in a Catching Kayla, an ESPN documentary.

At the age of 14 Kayla was an avid soccer player about to start her freshman year at Mount Tabor High School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, when she collapsed and felt a tingling sensation in her toes.

'When I run everything is ok': Kayla is one of the fastest runners her age in the US with the help of medication

Price she's willing to pay: She said she will do anything to be able to use her legs while she can

Ordeal: When her body heats up, her symptoms worsen. When she cools down, she can feel her legs again

Journey: When Patrick Cromwell met Kayla she was a very slow runner. Now she is a champion

A scan revealed early signs of MS. For eight months, she lost all feeling in her body.

Her mother, a care worker, said the diagnosis made her feel sick.

Kayla locked herself in her room.

She said: 'I didn't let anybody in my room I just wanted to be alone.

'And I was mad. I was just really mad. I couldn't see why this had happened to me. 

Growing up: Kayla was quiet, shy and creative as a child before getting into athletics and contact sports

Avid soccer player: Kayla loved soccer as a young teen before she fell during a game at the age of 14

Diagnosis: Scans done in October 2010 showed she had Multiple Sclerosis and lost all feeling for eight months

'I couldn't think of anything I'd done wrong. Why should I be punished? Why was this happening?'

Medication enabled Kayla to stem the onset of the disease's debilitating effects.

She was forced to give up contact sports like soccer.

But, unsure how long the treatment will last, she knew one thing: she wanted to run. Fast.

'She was average at best,' her coach, Patrick Cromwell, explains.

Determined: With the help of treatment she was able to start non-contact sports like running

Training: Kayla was distraught at first, then told her coach to push her as far as she could go

Disadvantage: Despite feeling no pain, the sensation when she runs is strange and difficult to compute

Fall: In the North Carolina State Championships this year she fell (circled) during the first lap

Success! Despite tumbling to the ground, she got up and ended up winning the race

That soon changed. 

And on the final race of her high school career, at the North Carolina State Championships in May, she won - despite collapsing in the first lap.

'As long as I'm running everything is ok,' she explained.
