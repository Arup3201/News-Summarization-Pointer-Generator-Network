Korean carmakers
Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp
 will have to pay $350 million in penalties to the U.S.
government for overstating fuel economy ratings in what
officials said on Monday was the biggest settlement of its kind.

The deal comes on top of $395 million the automakers agreed
to pay last December to resolve claims from the owners of the
vehicles, bringing the companies' total cost for the mileage
overstatements to more than $700 million.

Monday's settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, the U.S. Department of Justice and the California Air
Resources Board resolves an investigation of the South Korean
carmakers' 2012 fuel economy ratings.

Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia will pay the U.S. government a $350 million in penalties to end a two-year investigation into overstated gas mileage figures on window stickers of 13 models (file photo shows Hyundai Accent, foreground, and Elantra)

The penalties were the largest ever under the Clean Air Act.

'This will send an important message to automakers around
the world that they must comply with the law,' said Attorney
General Eric Holder.

Under the accord, which involved the sale of 1.2 million cars and SUVs, the South Korean car firms will pay a $100 million penalty, spend around $50 million to prevent future violations and forfeit emissions credits estimated to be worth more than $200 million. 

The greenhouse gas emissions that the forfeited credits
would have allowed are equal to the emissions from powering more
than 433,000 homes for a year, the EPA said.

'Businesses that play by the rules shouldn't have to compete
with those breaking the law,' said EPA Administrator Gina
McCarthy.

McCarthy said Hyundai and Kia had committed the most
egregious violation of the reporting standards. She declined to
say whether other violators may also be fined.

Attorney General Eric Holder said the penalties would send an important message to other automakers, while Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy, left, declined to say whether other violators might also be fined

Under the accord, the South Korean car firms will pay a $100 million penalty, spend around $50 million to prevent future violations and forfeit emissions credits estimated to be worth more than $200 million.

'Every automaker will be looking carefully at its current
testing procedure to avoid a similar penalty in the future,' said Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com,
who noted 'frustration in the gray area between automakers'
stated MPG numbers and the real-world results experienced by car
owners'.

In November 2012, Hyundai and Kia conceded they overstated
fuel economy by at least a mile per gallon on vehicles after the
EPA found errors for 13 Hyundai and Kia models from the 2011 to
2013 model years. 

Hyundai said at the time that the affected
cars' reported fuel economy would be adjusted by 1 to 2 miles
per gallon.

Hyundai Motor shares fell as much as 4.4 percent in trading
in Seoul on Tuesday, extending a slide that has dragged them to
their lowest in over four years.

The decline also knocked Hyundai from its perch as South
Korea's second-most valuable company after Samsung Electronics
Co Ltd, a spot it had held since March 29, 2011.

Hyundai and Kia both increased their shares of the U.S.
new-vehicle market in the past decade, particularly during the
economic downturn of 2008 to 2010 when consumers craved
fuel-efficient and relatively low-priced vehicles.

However, Hyundai has lost U.S. market share in the past
couple of years, as U.S. and Japanese rivals made a comeback.

Hyundai said on Monday that its U.S. vehicle sales fell 7
percent in October from a year earlier, lagging the market's 6
percent gain, with weaker sales of the Sonata sedan offsetting
demand for its Santa Fe sport utility vehicles. Kia's U.S.
shipments rose 12 percent in October.

'We are pleased to put this behind us,' said Hyundai U.S.
chief David Zuchowski. The company added that it believes its
process for testing vehicle fuel economy meets U.S. guidelines,
and the overstatement was a result of a data processing error.

Hyundai's U.S. chief at the time, John Krafcik, stepped down
after his contract expired at the end of 2013.

Kia in a statement said its priority 'remains making things
right for our customers through our fair and transparent
reimbursement program'.
