They married in secret a few days before he went to war.

Frank Fearing had no idea if he would ever see young Helen again, but he made her a solemn promise. Everywhere the American GI went with his unit, he would carve their names into a tree.

The first was on Salisbury Plain, where he was stationed before joining the push towards Berlin in the wake of the D-Day invasion. The rest were spread across France and Germany, carved whenever time allowed.

Fascinating work: Chantel Summerfield, 24, has become the world's only expert in military tree carvings by using the bark graffiti to trace soldiers' life stories

Helen Fearing never knew if it was 
just a romantic bluff, or if he had simply made up the story to impress 
her.

But they clearly didn’t reckon on the determination of British 
student Chantel Summerfield and her remarkable archaeological quest.

More than six decades later, and 
several years after Frank died, the 24-year-old specialist in military 
tree carvings tracked Helen down from the information on the Salisbury 
tree – and showed her the proof.

Love message: Miss Summerfield traced American GI Frank Fearing, left, and his wife Helen after finding the message he carved in 1945 on a tree, right, on Salisbury Plain

Joy: Miss Summerfield then sent Helen Fearing a photograph of the tree her late husband engraved for her on the other side of the world shortly before she died

It was one of hundreds of tree 
carvings Chantel has documented as part of her Bristol University PhD 
research into military ‘arborglyphs’.

Many tell the poignant stories of 
ordinary soldiers in the First and Second World Wars, some clearly 
composed by Tommies who feared they might otherwise be lost without 
trace in the mud of the WWI battlefields, or by Allied forces launched 
into bloody conflict in Normandy.

‘Frank Fearing – Hudson, 
Massachusetts, 1945,’ was followed by a love heart and the name Helen. 
From that simple inscription, Chantel traced the couple’s daughter 
Barbara in America, and was eventually able to present Helen with a 
photograph of the message her husband carved for her all those years 
ago.

Happy families: After he returned from the war Mr Fearing, seen left with his wife Helen and their granddaughter Marissa Metheny, then four, lived a long life until 2001

Snail mail: Mr Fearing also wrote to his wife in the more traditional way

‘It was amazing to be able to give her that and show her the 
carving,’ said Chantel, who has recorded 1,500 trees in France alone 
since starting her research five years ago. She uses military and public
 records, censuses and other material to identify individuals .

‘When you try to pick them out from 
thousands of marks, you start to get amazing stories,’ she said. ‘To me,
 it makes the soldiers individuals.

'Some of them will have given their 
lives with hardly anyone learning anything about them.’

Chantel, from Malvern, Worcestershire,
 noticed a dramatic contrast between messages left in pre-battle 
training grounds and personal information she uncovered on trees in 
France.

Another find: Miss Summerfield also tracked down the story of Clyde Henry Walker, seen with his wife Carmen Carmichael Walker on their wedding day, via his tree carving

Legacy: Clyde made the 'C H Walker, Australia' carving when he was stationed in Dunstable and Salisbury on June 19 1918. Miss Summerfield later tracked down his sons Kennith and Ian

Soldiers in a war zone often recorded as much information as 
they could, carving names of girlfriends, wives, times, dates, thoughts 
and feelings.

Yesterday she told me: ‘In England, many of the 
inscriptions are simply initials. By the time the soldiers get to 
France, they are carving self-portraits, pictures of their houses, 
animals... anything that’s important in their lives.

‘It’s as if people are saying “this is
 me, I was here, this is my wife, this is where I’m from – and tomorrow 
I’m going to face the enemy”. One inscription made reference to France 
in time of war and added: “Hell”.’

Until she starts to research the 
carvings, Chantel cannot tell if it will produce a tale of happiness or 
tragedy. ‘H Pearce, AIF, [for Australian Imperial Force] September 22 
1916’, for example, turned out to be Horace Pearce, who joined the Army 
aged 22 but died just weeks before the war ended.

Work in progress: Miss Summerfield, seen taking an imprint of an 'arborglyph', is studying the inscriptions as part of her archaeology PhD

Travelled: Miss Summerfield has been recording arborglyphs since 2007/8 and has travelled all over Europe to see them, from England to Scotland to Belgium and France

Another soldier – Clyde Henry Walker, 
who served in both World Wars – was deployed to England in 1918 and 
carved himself into history with this simple inscription: ‘C H Walker, 
Australia’.

Chantel traced his family and discovered he had won a 
bravery medal in France before going on to serve with colonial forces in
 the Indian army.

Chantel, whose PhD is being funded by 
the Arts and Humanities Research Council, is currently researching at 
Saltram House, Plymouth, where American forces were stationed in the 
Second World War. ‘Some carvings there have remained virtually unnoticed
 despite thousands of visitors,’ she said.

‘Unfortunately trees die or are cut down. That’s why I want to record as many as I can.’

Chantel Summerfield has become the world’s only expert in military tree carvings

She has traced WWI and WWII soldiers from the carvings they made during the wars

The PhD student has noticed carvings on trees in France hold a lot more information, including soldiers' feelings, than the ones in England
