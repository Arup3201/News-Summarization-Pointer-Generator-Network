One woman who hasn't been able to enjoy sex with her husband in over three years is looking forward to enjoying a normal sex life again after a surgical procedure on Embarrassing Bodies has helped treat her painful vagina.

Sian, 31, from South Wales visited Dr Dawn in the portable clinic when it visited the Big Cheese Festival in Caerphilly.

She explained that every time she and her husband have sex she develops pain like a friction burn at the entrance to her vagina making the area red and sore. 

Seeking help: Sian visited Dr Dawn in the portable clinic when it visited the Big Cheese Festival in Caerphilly to seek advice about her painful sex life

She said: 'I haven't been able to have sex without pain in over three years.

'Whenever I do actually have intercourse it goes very red and sore, it's like you're having friction burn.

'It started intermittently and it basically went on to be every time we tried.'

This had put a massive strain on Sian’s marriage and she told the TV doctor that it made her feel less of a woman. 

Craving normality: Sian explained to Dawn how she hadn't had pain-free sex in over three years

Sian then went to see Consultant Gynaecologist, Miss Gabrielle Downey at the BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham, who specialises in vulval pain. 

Miss Downey gave Sian some different thrush medication, a local steroid cream and a numbing gel to help improve her symptoms.

Miss Downey said that if the oral medication and cream didn’t work that she would offer Sian a quick surgical procedure to remove the sensitive, painful skin.

Successful surgery: Sian had the painful area of skin on her vagina removed and five days later was feeling much better

Sadly, the medication didn’t fully work so Sian had an operation to surgically remove the abnormal skin.

Miss Downey said: 'Sian has a well defined discreet
area of inflammation at the entrance to the vagina so I am going to 
remove it and isolate exactly where the pain comes from.'

Just five days later, Sian was back at Dr Dawn's clinic to see how she was healing up.

Amazing: 'This is amazing,' added Sian who is very happy, healing well and excited about rekindling her sex-life with her husband

Dr Dawn said: 'There is at least a 90 per cent chance of being completely pain free without the need for any more treatment.

'When she recovers, she will be nice and healed and ready for action.'

'This is amazing,' added Sian who is very happy, healing well and excited about rekindling her sex-life with her husband.

Embarrassing Bodies airs on Channel 4 on Monday's at 9pm.
