Crystal Palace 

Crystal Palace will be without Marouane Chamakh for their Barclays Premier League trip to Manchester City on Saturday.

Provisional squad: Speroni, Hennessey, Kelly, Fryers, Delaney, Mariappa, Dann, Ward, Hangeland, Jedinak, Bannan, McArthur, Bolasie, Thomas, Puncheon, Zaha, Gayle, Campbell, Johnson.

Marouane Chamakh will not feature for Crystal Palace at the Etihad due to a hamstring injury
