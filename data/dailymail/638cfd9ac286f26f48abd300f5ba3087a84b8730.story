Britain’s MINI is to ‘go Dutch’, German owners BMW announced today.

The news that MINIs are to be built in Holland came as the car giant announced it was investing a further £250million in its three UK Mini factories which will remain ‘the heart’ of the popular car.

The new money will be invested in manufacturing operations by the end of 2015 at the German car maker's manufacturing plant in Oxford, steel body pressings operation at Swindon and engine plant at Hams Hall near Birmingham.

Going Dutch: Britain's MINIs are to be built in Holland as BMW announces a £250million investment in its three factories in Oxford, Swindon and Birmingham

The firm said it would not create more jobs but would help safeguard and secure the 5,500 already there at the plants.

The company also announced a boost in production with up to 10 different Mini models that will have potential for additional production capacity at Oxford.

The moves were welcomed by Prime Minister David Cameron and Business Secretary Vince cable as a vote of confidence in Britain.

But behind the UK investment it also slipped out that it was to build MINIs abroad with a ‘contract manufacturer’ at the Nedcar plant in The Netherlands to help cope with booming demand and lack of capacity in the medium term.

MINI already builds the large MINI Countryman estate in Graz, Austria, in Austria in a contract deal with Magna Steyr.

The move helps ease a production bottle neck but will also be viewed as a means for BMW not to put all its MINI production eggs in one currency basket.

BMW said it always built close to its markets and that the MINI was a great blend of British heritage and BMW quality.

Still British? The move to the Netherlands will help ease a production bottle neck

Harald Krueger, member of the board of management at Munich-based  parent firm BMW Group, said: ‘A year ago we announced a further investment of £500 million in our UK production network by 2014 and today we are announcing an additional £250 million, taking us through to 2015. This brings the total to £1.75 billion since 2000.’

He said: ‘Over the last 11 years, Mini has been a unique global success and the BMW Group has even greater plans for the future development of the brand.’

He added: ‘Plant Oxford has played a major role in this with cars being exported to over 100 countries around the world.

'This additional investment is great news for all our employees in the UK and shows the BMW Group's commitment to Britain as a vital manufacturing base for us.’

Referring to its plans to build MINIs in Holland, BMW said the extra volume for its growth plans for the Mini and the complexity of new models means that additional production beyond Oxford's maximum capacity was needed in the medium term and the company was now considering how to achieve this.

Boost: Business Secretary Vince Cable said at the Oxford factory this morning that he welcomed the investment and it was a vote of confidence in Britain

‘Our preferred option is to establish a contract manufacturer as a satellite production as close to our UK operations as possible, at the Nedcar plant in The Netherlands, with whom BMW is in discussions.'

Mr Krueger said: ‘Oxford will provide special Mini production expertise for any new operation, particularly in the areas of dealing with the high complexity and customer individuality which Mini demands and in operating state-of-the-art, multi-model production lines.

'Just as Munich is the centre of the BMW world, Oxford is and will remain the home and the heart of Mini.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I am delighted that BMW has chosen to make such a significant investment in the UK. This demonstrates confidence in British manufacturing, provides a fantastic boost for the workforce, and shows we are making real progress in rebalancing the economy.’

Business Secretary Vince Cable, who is visited the Oxford factory said: ‘BMW's ambitious plans for Mini will ensure its UK sites at Oxford, Swindon and Hams Hall remain at the centre of Mini production worldwide.

'The investment of £250 million in addition to the £500 million last year demonstrates BMW's commitment to the UK and safeguards jobs for the future.’

Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke said: 'This major boost in investment is tribute and reward for the dedicated and hard-working workforce at Oxford, Swindon and Hams Hall.

‘The British car industry is once again a ray of sunshine in gloomy times for British manufacturing.

‘The Government urgently needs to learn the lessons that the UK car industry has to teach and start supporting the wider manufacturing sector.

‘The UK has the potential to be a manufacturing success story if we had a government which was prepared to roll its sleeves up and intervene to support employers up and down the UK.’

The Oxford MINI  factory last year built 191,474  vehicles and has capacity for 250,000 MINIs a year.

BMW builds 100,000 MINI Countryman models a year in Austria.

The new Dutch factory is likely to build new  niche sports  models of the MINI though the firm said it was ‘too early’ to say which models and how many.

BMW is providing more than 4,000 vehicles – including MINIs and bicycles – as part of its exclusive deal to provide transport for Olympic VIPs and athletes

BMW’s Olympic cars will have exclusive use of more than 250 miles of some of Britain's busiest roads which are to be specially reserved for elite Olympic VIPs.

Up to 80,000 officials, sponsors, politicians and athletes - dubbed 'the Games Family' -  will be whisked seamlessly down specially reserved congestion-free lanes - stretch from London to as far as Weymouth in Dorset  and encompassing parts of the M25 - while millions of motorists sit in gridlock.
