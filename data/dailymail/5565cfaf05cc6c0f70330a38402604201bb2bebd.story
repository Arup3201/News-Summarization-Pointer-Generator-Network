Cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to Daily Mail readers

She was turned down for life-changing surgery on the NHS.

But cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to Daily Mail readers.

The three-year-old was denied NHS funding last year for the surgery at the same Leeds hospital trust which gave aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham breast enlargements.

And even when readers raised £55,000 to pay for Sophie’s surgery her family were told by NHS doctors she was ‘not disabled enough’ to qualify – despite not being able to walk.

But the toddler has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon Dr Tae Park in the United States this autumn.

It means that, by the time she is four, Sophie could be walking. 

Sophie was born prematurely with spastic diplegia – a form of cerebral palsy. She needs the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery, which involves cutting the nerves in her spine, to be able to walk freely.

Sophie has strengthened her legs ahead of the operation using a specially-adapted £1,200 bicycle bought from readers’ donations.

Doctors said this means she is an ‘ideal candidate’ for the surgery and is likely to be able to walk completely unaided afterwards.

Sophie’s mother Allison, 41, a nurse, said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved.

She said: ‘Sophie wiped my face and she said “Mummy why are you crying?” I told her she was going to be able to walk and she said “Yes!”.

‘By the time she is four she could be walking. It’s very, very emotional, we just can’t believe it.

‘It is frustrating that Leeds turned us down but now we know that Sophie is going to have the best surgeon, so that is more reassuring. If anything goes wrong at least we know we did everything we could for her. 

‘As it gets nearer I’m sure the nerves will kick in - it’s a big operation. But it’s what she needs and it’s the best thing for her.

‘Sophie understands now that she is going to walk. She knows Dr Park will “fix her legs” and she knows she is going on a big plane to get there.’ 

The three-year-old was denied NHS funding last year for the surgery, but she has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon Dr Tae Park in the U.S.

Sophie’s mother Allison, 41, a nurse, said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved. She said: ‘If it wasn’t for the Daily Mail we wouldn’t be where we are now'

Mrs Thomlinson said Sophie had progressed to standing up on her own since using the bike bought from readers’ funds, which meant doctors had told her they were ‘confident’ she would be able to walk after surgery.

She added: ‘If it wasn’t for the Daily Mail we wouldn’t be where we are now, we just can’t thank everyone enough.

‘The messages we’ve had are so encouraging and we’re keeping them all for Sophie in a memory box for when she’s older.’

She and husband Craig, 45, from Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, are continuing to fundraise to get to their target of £75,000 which will cover their flights to the US and Sophie’s therapy and equipment she will need after surgery.

The family are fundraising through the charity Tree of Hope and any excess will go towards helping other disabled children.
