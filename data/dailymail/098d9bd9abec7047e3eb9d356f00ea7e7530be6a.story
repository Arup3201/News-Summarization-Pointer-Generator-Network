A garden centre advertising for a cook told applicants who claim benefits that their CV would be put in the bin.

A staff member at Hastings Garden Centre in East Sussex posted the advert on Facebook page 'The Bexhill-On-Sea Group' in the hunt for a new chef, but caused outrage with members.

It read: 'I need a reliable staff member at the Hastings Garden Centre Cafe as a cook.

The staff member from Hastings Garden Centre posted the job advert on a Facebook group asking for a cook

'If you are in receipt of benefits your application is going in the bin. Send cv to my inbox please.'

The notice, which is believed to have been posted by garden centre worker, Gavin Oram, was quickly removed - but not before many of the group's 5,500 members had seen it.

Local Lisa Giddon said: 'How horrible, what about genuine people on benefits because they want a job?'

Alan James added: 'I have just had to claim JSA after 11 years continuous employment.

'It is quite degrading being scrutinised by the job centre on your efforts to find work.

The Facebook post, by Gavin Oram, said 'if you are in receipt of benefits your application is going in the bin'

'His post was derogatory towards benefit claimants, insulting and infuriating.'

Colin Boylett wrote: 'How to lose potential customers in one easy lesson.'

But Mr Oram stood by the offensive notice and told members: 'It's not getting reworded.  

'I already have my books full of benefit claimants and don't need any more.' 

Wyevale Garden Centres, which runs the store, has apologised for the comments.

A spokesman said the views expressed by the member of staff on Facebook did not represent the view of the company.

Jason Danciger, food and beverage director, said: 'Wyevale Garden Centres would like to apologise for the comments made by a colleague on The Bexhill-On-Sea Group.

'The views of the individual in no way represent the views of Wyevale Garden Centres and we are sincerely sorry for any offence these comments may have caused.

'Our recruitment and selection policy states 'All candidates who apply for jobs will receive fair treatment and will be considered solely on their ability to do the job'.

'We are investigating this internally and will take the appropriate management action.' 

An expert from the Citizens Advice Bureau told MailOnline that while discrimination against a person who claims benefits is not specified under the Equality Act 2010, it could still be argued as illegal.

'Being on benefits isn't against the Equality Act, but the job advert could be argued as discriminatory,' they said.

'The act protects certain characteristics such as age, race, gender, disability and so on. If a person is disabled and claiming disability allowance they could certainly argue they had been discriminated against'.
