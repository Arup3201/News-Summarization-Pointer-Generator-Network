For most of its working life it was most commonly seen thousands of feet in the air, transporting jet-setters to all corners of the world.

But this decommissioned Boeing 747 jumbo jet ended up causing travel misery today as it crawled down the motorway behind a police escort. 

The front section and cockpit of the 'Queen of the Skies' made its way from Cotswold Airport in Kemble, Gloucestershire, down the A419 dual carriageway between Cirencester and Swindon. 

The disused plane will eventually be put back together on a site in Staffordshire to provide a studio for interior design university students.

Weighing 60-tonnes, the aircraft measures 22 feet wide, 16ft 3ins high and is 137ft long.

The disused aircraft on the back of a lorry takes up the whole of a narrow country lane as it makes its way into Cirencester 

The abnormally large load took up two lanes of the motorway as it travelled from Cotswold Airport via Herefordshire and onto Staffordshire

The decommissioned Boeing 747 caused further travel misery (pictured on M4) on the same day as two major crashes on the M40 and M1 

The aircraft left the Cotswold Airport at 7am today and will head north to Cirencester, then south east heading north up the M5 through Gloucestershire.

It will then be driven to Hereford, before arriving at the Staffordshire site where it will be converted into a unique studio for interior design students

Helen Keighley, director of quality and business at the academy, said the old plane had deliberately been chosen for a venue for the students to work in because it would provide a challenging and creative environment for them.

She said: 'It's much cheaper than putting up a building. We are really going to prepare them for the world of work.

'They're not going to sit in a lecture theatre, they're going to be totally in the design practice.

'They will work there for 45 weeks a year and learn how to design venues.'

Police warned the abnormally large loads were likely to cause considerable disruption to motorists. 

A spokesman for Wiltshire police said. 'Due to the size of these transporters they will be slow moving and will have the potential to create congestion.

'Wherever possible disruption will be kept to a minimum but hauliers and motorists are asked to please be patient if they come across this load.

'Anyone travelling over this period to catch a flight or meet appointments should allow sufficient additional time.

'Please be aware that once on the A419 these loads will be slow moving and take up the entire southbound carriageways.

'Regular updates and travel information in respect of this abnormal load will be passed from our control room at Devizes when appropriate to help motorists plan their journey.' 

The transfer of the aircraft will add to the travel misery this Valentine's Day. 

It comes as two major crashes, on the M40 near Bicester in Oxfordshire and the M1 near Flitwick in Bedfordshire, caused long tailbacks.

The Boeing 747 is a wide-body commercial airliner and cargo transport aircraft, often referred to by its original nickname, Jumbo Jet, or Queen of the Skies. 

Its iconic 'hump' upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft make it among the world's most recognizable aircraft.

First flown commercially in 1970, the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years.

The 747 is to be replaced by the Boeing Y3 (part of the Boeing Yellowstone Project) in the future.
