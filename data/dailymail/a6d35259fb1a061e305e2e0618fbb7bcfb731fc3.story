Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Phil Neville couldn't help Salford City in their pre-season friendly against Stalybridge Celtic.

The former Old Trafford duo invested in the non-league club along with fellow 'Class of 92' icons Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs.

Scholes and Neville were on the touchline, but couldn't inspire their side who were beaten 3-0. Neville wore shorts in the late evening sun while former midfielder Scholes donned sunglasses.

The pair - along with their fellow former United charges - are aiming to guide the club to league football.

Salford City currently play in the Evo Stik League First Division North - English football's eighth tier - but they have big ambitions.

'The short-term aim is to keep the club going on the level it is going,' said Neville earlier this month.

'It is very sustainable. The committee do a great job and they will carry on doing that. We are not going to interfere in any way with how the club is run.

'But there is a fairytale story to this. Can we get into the Football League? Can we take Salford City as high as we possibly can? It is going to be a fantastic journey.'
