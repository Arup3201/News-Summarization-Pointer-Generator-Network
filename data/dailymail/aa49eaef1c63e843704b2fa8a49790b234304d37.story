Cheap gas is good news for the American economy, but bad news for Tesla Motors and its electric cars. 

A top analyst slashed his earnings projections for the California-based auto company - estimating that Tesla will sell 40percent fewer cars in the next five years than he had previously forecast. 

Tesla's stock has fallen 31percent since hitting a high in September. On Monday is closed below $200 a share fro the first time since May - hitting a seven-month low. 

Oil prices have plunged more than 40 percent during that time period and gas is down to $2 a gallon in many states.

Analysts believe that sales of the $35,000 Tesla Model 3, pictured here in an unofficial rendering, will be hurt by the low price of fuel

Investors are betting that cheap gas will make electric cars less attractive to most buyers. 

Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley auto analyst who has previously been optimistic about Tesla, revised his forecasts of the company's sales today.

He said he believes that Tesla will sell only 300,000 cars by 2020 - far fewer than the 500,000 he initially predicted.

Most of the revised estimate revolves around the new Tesla Model 3, the much cheaper consumer version of the company's  Tesla S roadster - which can cost up to $105,000.

Mr Jonas says he believes fewer people will be interested in buying electric cars when gas is cheap - especially the new Model 3. 

The price of crude oil has plummeted 40percent in recent months - down to just over $55 a barrel - as the market is flooded with oil from Saudi Arabia and the shale fracking boom in the US

Tesla says the Model 3, which is due out in 2017, will cost $35,000 - making it affordable to a much wider segment of the car market.

'While nobody buying a Model S today (for nearly $105,000) is doing so to save on their monthly expenses, the longer-term story is far more dependent on the volume success of the Model 3. Oil price is a factor for Model 3,' Mr Jonas wrote, according to CNN Money. 

Mr Jonas also predicts that the Model 3 will cost closer to $60,000 by the time it is released - making it affordable for a much smaller segment of the market. 

Mr Jonas said he believes that the long-term success of the company relies on it successfully selling high volumes of cheaper electric cars - rather than cornering the market on high-end electrics.

However, he still believes Tesla is a good investment - though he cut his price projections to $290 a share from $320.  

Shares of Tesla, started by billionaire PayPal founder Elon Musk, rose slightly on Wednesday morning, hitting $202.85 before noon.
