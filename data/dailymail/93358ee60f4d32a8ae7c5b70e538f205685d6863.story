Cops investigating the murder of texting 14-year-old April Millsap have set up roadblocks in her Michigan hometown and questioned hundreds of drivers - hoping to generate new leads in the case.

Police say tips all but dried up after they raided the home of a sex offender and made two arrests earlier this week. However, both men face charges only related to marijuana found in the home and cops have not said that they are suspects in April's murder.

'Everyone thinks this case is solved. It is not. Nobody is in custody for April’s death,' Michigan State Police Lieutenant Michael Shaw told the Macomb Daily newspaper.

Cops reportedly stopped and questioned every driver coming into or leaving Armada, Michigan on Thursday night - one week after April Millsap was found murdered in a ditch

Rain or shine: Even a rainstorm didn't stop officers from questioning drivers. Authorities say the operation yielded helpful tips in the investigation

Horrific: Family members say April Millsap, 14, was beaten to death as she was walking her dog Penny on a popular hiking path near her house last Thursday

Local cops, state police troopers and FBI agents were out in force in Armada, Michigan, on Thursday night, stopping every car going into or leaving town, WXYZ-TV reports.

The three-hour 'rolling canvas' backed up traffic and angered some civil libertarians, who say the tactics are unconstitutional.

However, authorities say the maneuver generated helpful leads. Officers were looking for anyone who was in the area of Macomb Orchard Trail between 6pm and 6.30pm last Thursday night - or saw April walking her dog Penny, which she did every evening.

Investigators also asked if anyone had seen a blue-and-white motorcycle in the area at the time - which remains one of their best clues to discovering who killed April.

April was found dead in a ditch near 
Macomb Orchard Trail by joggers last Thursday. Her faithful dog Penny, whom she walked
 on the trail every night, was guarding her body.

Traffic into Armada backed up all along the major roadways on Thursday as cops stopped nearly every car from 5pm until 8pm

after her faithful dog Penny started barking frantically. Police say the
 pooch refused to leave her master's side - even after April had been 
murdered

Detectives
 say that before her murder, she sent a frantic text message to her 
boyfriend saying, 'OMG... I think I'm being kidnapped.'

Authorities won't reveal how April died, but her family told the Macomb Daily that she was beaten to death.

The two men arrested on Wednesday are set to be arraigned today. Thus far, they only face charged related to the 15 marijuana plants found at their home during a police search.

The Macomb Daily reports that 66-year-old James VanCallis is one of the men who was arrested.

FBI Special Agent David Porter refused to comment on whether they would face any charges related to April's murder.
