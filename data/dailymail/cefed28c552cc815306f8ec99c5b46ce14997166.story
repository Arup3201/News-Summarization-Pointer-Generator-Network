A long time ago in a studio far, far away... artist Colin Cantwell created these incredible sketches of spaceships that would be made into icons by the Star Wars movies.

The artwork includes early versions of the X-wing fighters, piloted by Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy of films, and the Imperial Star Destroyer - the flagships of Darth Vader's fleet.

The pencil drawings were done in 1974 and 1975, two years before the release of the first Star Wars film, and show George Lucas's franchise could have looked quite different.

A long time ago: The original sketches of spaceships from Star Wars show how different the films could have looked, including this X-Wing fighter with just two wings

Iconic: Later sketches show how the two-wing design turned into a craft with four wings that flipped out from the sides, as in the final movies

Different: This strange ship is actually an Imperial Star Destroyer but flipped around. The fighters emerging from its sides suggest that the design of the TIE fighter also changed several times

As it appeared: This is how the Star Destroyers appeared in the final version of the Star Wars films

The Imperial Star Destroyer appears back-to-front, with the bridge at the traditional front end of the ship, while the flat back end has a large pillar coming from it and fighter bays to each side.

Rather than a series of laser cannons, the ship is instead equipped with three large satellite-dish weapons, and judging by the fighters spilling from its side, was originally intended to be much smaller than the version which appeared in the films.

As for the TIE fighters themselves, these drawings seem to suggest the originals would have been small, white, triangular craft which bear no resemblance to the bat-like ships they became.

And judging from one sketch, the X-Wings could have had only two wings instead of their iconic four - though a later sketch shows them almost as they appear in the films.

The artworks were kept by Mr Cantwell in his own provate collection, but are going up for auction in Beverly Hill in December.

Evolving: This later design of a Star Destroyer shows it has taken on something resembling its final form, although rather than laser cannons it is now armed with weapons that look like satellite-dishes

Use the force: In this sketch, completed some time between 1974 and 1975, an X-wing fighter attacks a Star Destroyer, foreshadowing the epic space battles the films would become famous for

Far, far away: These pencil sketches were completed between 1974 and 1975, two years before the first Star Wars films was ever released

Almost identical: Bar a few minor changes, the X-Wings appeared almost identically in the film version

Alongside the drawings is an original screenplay for the first Star Wars film from January 1975, when it was called 'Adventures of the Starkiller (Episode One)'.

Mr Cantwell's career spanned film, television and news programming, and items from Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey, Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the very first IMAX film called Voyage To Outer Planets, will be up for grabs.

Also on sale is a set of NASA Apollo 11 flight plans that Mr. Cantwell used in studio at CBS as he worked with Walter Cronkite in his historic broadcast of the 1969 moon landing.

Mr Cantwell's career began in 1955 when he attended the University of California Los Angeles as an art and engineering major.

After suggesting that UCLA add an animation major to their curriculum, he then became the first animation graduate from the University.

After working for Hewlett Pakcard and as a PR agent for NASA, he moved into film and moved to England to work with Kubrick.

Unfamiliar: This ship seems to be based on the early version of the TIE fighters seen coming out of the Star Destroyer, but perhaps more closely resembles the snow speeders used in the battle on Hoth

On the attack: A snow speeder is seen during the famous Hoth battle scene, the design of which could have been taken from the craft above

For sale: The sketches, all done by artist Colin Cantwell, will be auctioned as part of a collection of his film memrobilia, which also includes items from the set of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Battlestar Galactica

During a midnight snack at Kubrick's home, the director told Colin that he had replaced his fourth composer and still was not satisfied with the music. 

Mr Cantwell was the one to suggest  Also sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss as the opening music, and mentioned Adagio by Aram Kachaturian and Atmospheres by Gyorgy Ligeti.

After working with Kubrick, Mr Cantwell helped to design and direct the first IMAX film - then called OMNIMAX - before going to work for George Lucas.

Mr Cantwell worked on both the first Star Wars film and Star Wars: A New Hope, designing the X-Wing, Y-Wing, Tie Fighter, Star Destroyer, Landspeeder, Sandcrawler, and Millennium Falcon, and Death Star.

Valuable: Also included in the auction is this fist edition of the original Star Wars script when the series was still called Adventures Of The Starkiller

He was also responsible for designing the tench and hole which Luke fires into to destroy Vader's ultimate space station.

During the moon landing in July 1969, Mr Cantwell was also behind the 'Hal 9000' computer that was feeding Walter Cronkite landing data that was broadcast live on CBS.

Martin Nolan, executive director of Julien's Auctions, said:  'The Colin Cantwell Collection is beyond extraordinary. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for collectors to own a piece of history from some of the most important moments in film and television.'
