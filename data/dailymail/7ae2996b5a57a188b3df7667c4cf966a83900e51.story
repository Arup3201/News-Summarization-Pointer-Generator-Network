A man who was targeted by counter-terrorism police as part of an investigation into ISIS has been granted bail, with his lawyer describing the claims as a distraction.

Omar Ammouche was taken into custody earlier this month after authorities allegedly found 50 shotgun shells in a cooler bag in the kitchen of his  Greenacre home in Sydney's west.

The 33-year-old  man was arrested and was later charged with acquiring and possessing prohibited ammunition without holding a licence.

The Central Local Court heard Ammouche was being monitored as part of an investigation following two Australians involved in 'hostile activities' overseas.

'We have been monitoring their connections in Australia ... one of them we say is Mr Ammouche,' Detective Sergeant Katherine Weissel, who is attached to the counter-terrorism unit, said in evidence.

During the raids, prosecutor David Anderson told the court that police had also uncovered a flag and clothing associated with ISIS, also known as Islamic State or IS, in a car at Ammouche's home on Chiswick Road.

He said Ammouche had previously been placed on a good behaviour bond for firearm offences.

But Ammouche's lawyer Adam Houda said claims he was a supporter of ISIS was a 'distraction' and 'highly prejudicial'.

'He is charged with two very basic matters and they're unrelated to terrorism.'

This comes after Jibryl Almaouie was charged with a string of offences, including unauthorised firearm possession, also on Friday after a separate terrorism raid in December.

The 21-year-old attended Surry Hills Police Station earlier this month where he was arrested at 2.30pm  after counter-terrorism police seized a rifle, two shotguns and a large amount of ammunition at a Condell Park house in Sydney's west on December 18.

The two men, who are not co-accused, did not appear when their cases were mentioned in Parramatta Local Court on Saturday.

It follows as the raids were carried out in Sydney's southwest, in relation to Operation Duntulm which is part of the Joint Counter Terrorism Team, and allegedly seized a number of items including a quantity of prohibited drugs and documents.

It was the same operation which saw the arrest of Mohamed Elomar's wife, Fatima, at Sydney Airport on May 3 when she was trying to board a flight to Malaysia with her four children. 

It is part of Operation Appleby, which is investigating  domestic terrorism and foreign incursions in Syria and Iraq.

Other warrants were executed in Leppington, Condell Park and Punchbowl. 

Police allege that a quantity of prohibited drugs were seized from another man in Punchbowl.

A NSW Police statement said the raids were executed 'not as a result of any specific terrorism threat'.

Operation Duntulm is an ongoing Joint Counter Terrorism Team (Sydney) investigation into alleged financial assistance and support being provided for foreign fighters overseas. 

Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch, Commander of the Counter Terrorism and Special Tactics Command said Operation Duntulm the raids are a timely reminder that police 'will not become complacent, and remain committed to disrupting criminal activity'.

'The operation today is about the gathering of evidence and intelligence to enable us to take action against those who think they can engage in these activities,' he said.

'Investigators this morning seized a range of items from the premises searched including documents and computers, and these will be forensically examined. 

'It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe in, if you choose to illegally fight in an overseas conflict you are not only breaking the law, you are placing yourself in immense danger.'

Australian Federal Police Acting National Manager Counter Terrorism Peter Crozier said community safety was the primary objective of all Joint Counter Terrorism Team activities.

'The priority for all agencies involved in these operations is to ensure the safety of the community, and we encourage all people to speak to us if they have any concerns or have information they wish to provide,' Acting Assistant Commissioner Crozier said

'Now more than ever, it is important for the community and police to continue to work together and promote the diverse, inclusive and supportive society we have here in Australia.'
