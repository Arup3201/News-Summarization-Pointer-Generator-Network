It was once an elaborate courtship-ritual where high-born young ladies would cast their eyes around for a titled husband and mingle with royalty.

But the Grand Viennese Debutante Ball has remained one of the most anticipated events of the year and gives young people the chance to bring a splendid tradition back to life.

Wearing matching white dresses, headbands and lace gloves, 36 debutantes waltzed to Strauss with students from the Naval Academy Morosini at the Roman Aquarium.

They were all presented to the Austrian Ambassador in Italy, His Excellency Christian Berlakovits.

One of the organisers said: 'It is a rite, a dream, a message – the symbol of a world and an era that is worth reintroducing to today’s young people. 

'The best way to bring the values of a tradition back to life is to make them more current, allowing them to be discovered in their deepest meaning – even by those who, in the tumult of today’s society, appear to have neglected them, or, far worse, to have forgotten them altogether.'

The girls are aged between 16 and 23 years old and the event is twinned with the famous Opera Ball in Vienna.

It is viewed as an important rite of passage and the symbol of an era that is worth reintroducing to today’s young people
