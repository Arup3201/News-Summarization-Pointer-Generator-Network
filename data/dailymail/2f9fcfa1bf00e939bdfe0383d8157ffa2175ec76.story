A music fan who created an Ed Sheeran parody video using his  goatee to replicate the singer's famous ginger locks has told of his shock after it went super-viral racking up over 22 million hits in just two days.

Shaun Solomon says he spent about four minutes making the clip which sees him lip-syncing along to Sheeran's smash hit Thinking Out Loud.

His ginger goatee has been  prepared to recreate the singer's trademark hair with two eyes and a nose crudely painted on upside down to complete the effect.

Spot the difference: Multi-platinum singer Ed Sheeran and retail manager Saul Soloman's goatee which has racked up an incredible 22 million internet hits in just two days

But Mr Solomon, a retail worker from Northampton, could never have guessed just how popular his singing chin was about to become.

After posting the clip on his own YouTube page it was picked up LadBible which placed it on its Facebook page where  it has so far received around nine million hits.

It was also posted by the UniLad Facebook page where it has gathered over 13 million  hits.

Added to the 180,000 hits on Mr Soloman's YouTube page it means his chin has been watched by well over 22 million people.

Mr Solomon said he is amazed by how many people have watched his singing chin and says he'd be in 'big trouble' if he decided to shave

Mr Solomon, 23, said: 'It's amazing how it's exploded. It started as a just a giggle between a few mates.

'I'm a big Ed Sheeran fan and it was either going to be him or Mick Hucknall, so I think we made the right choice.

'It's mad to think that he might have seen it.' 

'I've had the goatee for three years and it's got me a bit of stick, but if I shaved it now I'd be in deep trouble.'
