A police officer and former Mr Gay UK is facing the sack after head-butting a man in the toilets of a nightclub.

Police Constable Mark Carter has been suspended from duty following the assault during which he headbutted a man in the toilets of The Thompsons Arms in Manchester's gay village.

The high profile cop was convicted of assault by beating following a trial before Manchester Magistrates Court last week.

The victim was a man Carter had been friends with on Facebook.

Carter was made the subject of a 12 month community order and told to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay Â£100 compensation to his victim.

The conviction comes three years after Carter, of Gomersal, West Yorkshire, was cleared by a jury of raping a man at a Leeds hotel following a high-profile court trial.

Carter, who was named Mr Gay UK in 2006, was cleared of raping the man and carrying out two sexual assaults  following an alleged incident in December 2009.

Speaking after Carter's assault conviction last week, Detective Chief Superintendent Clive Wain, of West Yorkshire Police's professional standards department, said: 'West Yorkshire Police expects the very highest standards of its officers and staff, both on and off duty.

'Criminal behaviour or conduct which falls below this standard will not be tolerated.

'We note the verdict of the court in relation to this officer. PC Carter remains suspended from duty ahead of an internal misconduct hearing.'

When approached  yesterday, Carter said he was appealing the conviction and would not comment further until matters were concluded, but said he wanted to 'move on'.

Nick Smart, chairman of West Yorkshire Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said it would be inappropriate comment until the conclusion of internal disciplinary proceedings.

In 2009, Carter was alleged to have sexually assaulted three men before raping a 22-year-old man in the Leeds hotel room Carter was staying in.

Two years later, a jury returned not guilty verdicts on the two rape and two sex assault charges laid following what was a police Christmas night out.

The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a third sex assault charge but a decision was taken not to pursue a further trial.

Carter told the jury he believed the 22-year-old complainant had willingly gone back with him to the hotel to have sex.

Following the acquittals, Carter was also charged with possessing anabolic steroids but the case was discontinued after prosecutors accepted his explanation that the drug was for a medicinal purpose.

He returned to work in December 2011.
