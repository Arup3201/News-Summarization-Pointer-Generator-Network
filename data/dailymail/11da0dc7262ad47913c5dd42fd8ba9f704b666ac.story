On a Friday night out, you want to be looking your best, so imagine the embarrassment and humiliation one man felt when told he wouldn't be allowed into a local bar because of the color of his shorts.

Daniel Parker from Grand Rapids Michigan, was looking forward to spending the evening at Mojo’s Dueling Piano Bar but he was turned away with a friend at the door, because he was wearing gold-colored shorts made of Lamé, a metallic fabric.

Mr Parker posted on Facebook earlier this week claiming he was discriminated against.

Entry denied: Daniel Parker was told he would not be allowed into the Grand Rapids piano bar because his shorts violated the dress code and looked like they were from a costume

The offending articles: These shiny sleek shorts were deemed to be outside of Mojo's dress code

Gossip: Daniel said he could hear the door staff talking about him in the line even before he asked to be let in

If you're wearing gold shorts, you're not coming in: Daniel Parker was told by the doorman (pictured) that his colorful choice of shorts were not suitable for the bar. The owners have since apologised to him

He was told by the doorman that Mojo’s was 'a bar with standards and a dress code' and his shorts were too costume-like.

He took to Facebook to rant not only at the bar but at the city of Grand Rapids too, citing the city's cultural intolerance.

'I'm so hurt that Grand Rapids can claim to be up and coming in the world, yet still be so culturally behind.

It should be noted that this is not the first bar my wardrobe has been an issue at. Grand Rapids may no longer be on the Top 10 dying cities list… But I feel its people might be changing that.

What's going to happen when Art Prize 
rolls around this year? Slated to be the biggest yet, with visitors from
all over the country. Will the local bars refuse  to serve anyone not 
wearing stock mall clothing?'

His post has been shared by 210 people who promised to send angry emails to the bar.

The
bar has finally taken notice and apologised citing a 'communication 
breakdown' promising to teach staff how to differentiate between 'a 
dress code violation and an individual expressing oneself in an 
innocently creative manner.'

Rules must be obeyed: Daniel was told by the doorman at Mojo¿s was 'a bar with standards and a dress code' and his shorts were too costume-like

Are these shorts acceptable? Daniel is seen with his specially designed shoes and man-purse

Designer: A budding fashion designer, Daniel designed the gold shorts himself after realizing they were the latest 'in' thing on the catwalks around the world

The latest trend: On his blog, Daniel mentioned how shiny gold clothing is the latest fashion must-have and that he was simple adhering to the 'norm' by wearing them

'Our employees acted as they believed was necessary to enforce our establishment’s dress code. However, it is clear that our dress code needs to be modified in order to accommodate for individuals whose fashion selections may be a little more fashion forward than we are accustomed to.'

The bar did state that 'there are certain guidelines we will continue to uphold' in regards to a dress code.

'No
excessively holey jeans, no cutoff shirts, etc.,' the post read. 'But 
Mr. Parker's attire is something we have not previously been presented 
with at Mojo's and, thus, requires addressing.'

Owner Tom Wojciakowski characterized the entire situation as a non-event which was handled by the manager at the time.

'Mojo's
is open to anyone, he said to Mlive.com. 'We have everybody from 21 to 60, from all 
walks of life, in on a regular basis. However this turned into a 
discrimination thing is 100 percent false.'

Mr
Parker describes himself as a fashion expert. 'I have studied it for 
years. I run a DIY fashion blog, studsandbuttonholes.com, with a small 
following of about 40,000. I have also been published  internationally 
in fashion books and magazines over the years,' he writes.

'Metallics 
was a huge trend for Menswear Summer 2013. All the important shows had 
some type of metallic in it. Be it Burberry, Lanvin, Frankie Morello... 
So in the rest of the world my outfit was on trend and nothing out of 
the 'norm' as they liked to call it. They also happened to be something 
locally made in west Michigan by myself.

The
discrimination comes into play when the other guys in our group 
(wearing shorts the same length and style) could enter the bar without 
question. But I could not, and with no explanation, other than I was 
wearing a 'costume.''

Mr Parker 
said the bar reached out to him late on Wednesday and added he hopes to 
reach an 'agreement that makes both parties happy.'
