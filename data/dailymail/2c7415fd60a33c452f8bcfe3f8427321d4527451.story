The gimmick is part of the Republican National Committee's effort to shut down a presumed Hillary 2016 presidential campaign before it ever officially begins

'The media has given Hillary $50 million worth of free media this week without being offered the chance for a Republican response,' Republican National Committee Deputy Press Secretary Raffi Williams told reporters in an email.

'So we are making sure everyone knows that Hillary has no accomplishments as Secretary of State by having a squirrel hand out fact sheets and bumper stickers, because we all know another Clinton in the White House is nuts!'

'Another Clinton in the White House is Nuts,' says the squirrel's shirt

The HRC Squirrel mascot that appeared in Washington, D.C. today is linked to a broader a effort by the RNC is to put an end to a Hillary 2016 presidential campaign before it even begins.

'Hillary and Bill Clinton are the epitome of career politicians—jumping from job to job, clawing their way to the top, and clinging to the liberal big-spenders who will stock their bank accounts,' reads a statement on an RNC donation page promoting it's HRC squirrel earned media campaign.

'From her out-of-touch comments about being “dead broke” to her squirrely answers on Benghazi, this time Hillary Clinton is climbing up the wrong tree.'

The RNC has also launched an HRC Squirrel account attacking Hillary.

'Find me where the nuts are,' states the twitter account's bio. 'Right now 
that’s the fiction aisle with anyone who believes @HillaryClinton’s 
spin!'

A tweet mocking the Democratic Party 
for not having a strong bench of 2016 candidates outside of Clinton 
says, 'Even I know not to put all my acorns in one basket.'

'What's the difference between an #Obama presidency and a #Clinton presidency? NUTTIN',' reads another one of the mascot's tweets.

Today the squirrel, manned by an intern named Justin, was accompanied in Washington by four RNC staff. Williams said similar cohort will be crashing Hillary's book signing tomorrow morning at the Pentagon City Costco in Arlington, Virginia.

The bushy-tailed rodent will be chasing 
Hillary from book event to book event, Williams told the Daily Beast, 'as long as 
it works.'
