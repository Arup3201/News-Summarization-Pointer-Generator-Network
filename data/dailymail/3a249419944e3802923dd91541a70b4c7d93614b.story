This horrifying CCTV footage shows the moment a sword-wielding raider held up a bookmakers while waving a two-foot blade at staff and fleeing with £200.

The robber can be seen vaulting the counter at the Coral branch in Burnley, Lancashire, brandishing the weapon as he demanded the day's takings. 

Two terrified members of staff fled the desk in terror as he chased them around the store, striking a computer screen and knocking over a number of displays.

Caught: A masked robber walked into the Coral branch in Burnley, Lancashire, brandishing the weapon

He grabbed the money from the till and is believed to have made off into a nearby residential area.

Lancashire Police has now released the CCTV footage in a bid to jog people's memories of the incident after they were unable to trace the balaclava-clad robber following a public appeal. 

Det Con Dave Greenwood said: 'This was a violent and aggressive attack which left two members of staff terrified and fearful for their own safety.

'It has been some time since the initial incident but we remain determined to identify the man responsible and hope that someone who views the footage may hold important information about his identity.'

The masked man arrived at the shop on Harry Potts Way at around 8.45pm on July 21, armed with the sword and approached the counter to demand money from staff. 

Police say he was white, around 5ft 10in tall, slim, and spoke with a local accent. He was wearing a grey tracksuit top with a logo on the top of the hood and dark tracksuit bottoms at the time.
