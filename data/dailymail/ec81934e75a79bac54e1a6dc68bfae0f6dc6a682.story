Las Vegas has been voted the ‘overspend’ capital of the year and the destination most likely to encourage tourists to become too flash with their cash, according to a survey.

Two thirds of Brits ranked the glitzy US city number one, followed by Paris, then New York.

Venice and Ibiza make up the top five destinations where holidaymakers are most likely to part with too much cash.

The new research discovered that 57 per cent of Britons have blown their holiday budget while abroad - with 6 per cent even having to return home early after running out of finances while away. 

Asked why they had spent too much while on a break, 55 per cent said they had been ‘caught up in the excitement of being on holiday’, while 33 per cent said that they ‘had not budgeted well’ for their trip.

The research, conducted by www.vouchercloud.com, surveyed 1,973 UK over 18s who had been on holiday in the past five years.

The survey also quizzed travellers on how they managed to get hold of extra cash while away.

Some 45 per cent stated they had to draw more money out whilst abroad, incurring bank charges, followed by 32 per cent that said they had been forced to put items on their credit cards and 20 per cent who had called upon family members and friends at home.

A further 6 per cent had to call their holiday short in order to come home early after running out of money.

Matthew Wood, a spokesman for vouchercloud.com, said: ‘It’s easy to see why people overspend on holiday. 

‘You’re often caught in the moment and just want to enjoy yourself, leaving all the financial constraints and worries at home. 

‘Plus, in the back of your mind, you know that you may only get one chance to see, do and buy these things; you might never go back to that destination again!

‘The best way to get round this, which is often overlooked during the planning process, is to do a bit more research into what the destination and local area has to offer before you step foot anywhere near a plane. 

‘There is plenty of information on the net and in travel guides, which will mean you can budget effectively with a level head and avoid any unexpected expenditure whilst enjoying your holiday.’
