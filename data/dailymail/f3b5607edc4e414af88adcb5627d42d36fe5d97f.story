Costing £56million between the pair, Erik Lamela and Roberto Soldado failed to make meaningful returns on their huge transfer fees for Tottenham last season.

But despite a gloomy 2013-14 campaign, Spurs' two most expensive signings looked in good spirits as they prepared to fly out to Helsinki ahead of the north London club's pre-season friendly against Celtic on Saturday.

The pair drove to the airport together, before posing with a more stone-faced Sandro who wore a back-to-front cap ahead of their departure for Finland.

Lamela, a record £30million signing from Roma last summer, has especially impressed under new boss and compatriot Mauricio Pochettino during the club's pre-season tour of the United States, following a year where poor form and injury hampered his White Hart Lane progress.

Spurs won two of their three fixtures Stateside with the Argentine scoring twice in a 3-2 win over Toronto.

'I am happy with my situation because I had a long injury and now I can train normally,' Lamela told Tottenham's club website. 'The tour went well and I feel good.'

'This pre-season is very important for me, for my fitness and I’m hoping for a big year. I think I can play better than I did last season and I hope this happens for me and for the Spurs fans. I would love to do well for them.'
