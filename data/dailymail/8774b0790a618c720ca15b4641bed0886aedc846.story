Around 650 people will attend Tuesday night's behind-closed-doors Champions League clash between CSKA Moscow and Manchester City.

Although the official attendance will be given as zero, a combination of sponsors, media, delegates and centre circle boys and parents means there will at least be a crowd of some sort at the match.

UEFA have banned the sale of tickets and ordered the match to be played behind closed doors as punishment for the racist behaviour of CSKA fans.

UEFA Partners (Sponsors) - 300

Media - 150

Club delegates - 150 (75 each)

Centre circle boys and parents - 50

TOTAL - 650 

But City fans who are not allowed inside the stadium may feel particularly aggrieved that there will be 300 UEFA "partners" in attendance.

A group of 16 travelling fans had planned to rent a flat in an apartment block overlooking the CSKA Moscow Stadium so they could watch their side in action.

However, their plans have been scuppered as Russian police have stepped in to stop the fans going near the ground, according to the Manchester Evening News.

Last month, Bayern Munich supporters rented a room in a tower block overlooking the Arena Khimki, giving them a bird's-eye view of proceedings.

The game was played without fans as punishment for the racist chants and banners of CSKA supporters against Viktoria Plzen last December.

Fan troubles have plagued the Russian club in European competition.

Yaya Toure complained he had been the victim of racial abuse while playing them last season and in their match against Roma last month their supporters were involved in numerous incidents with the local police.

But last month Pep Guardiola's side were unperturbed by the vacant stands and have now won successive Champions League group games with a 1-0 scoreline. Thomas Muller's penalty was enough to seal the win in the Russian capital.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini has described the game as a must-win after picking up just one point in their opening two games.
