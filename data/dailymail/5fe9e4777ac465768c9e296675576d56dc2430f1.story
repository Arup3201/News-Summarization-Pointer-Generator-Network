The children who escaped last month's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut are returning to classes on Thursday at a refurbished school renamed after their old one, school officials said Wednesday.

Newtown Superintendent of Schools Janet Robinson announced that the students' new school, the former Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe, has been renamed after a decision was taken by staff from the previous Sandy Hook school.

‘That's who they are. They're the Sandy Hook family,’ Robinson said after a news conference at a park in Monroe a few miles from the school, which opens for classes on Thursday morning. An open house was held for parents and students on Wednesday.

School superintendent Janet Robinson said the decision to re-name the new school as Sandy Hook Elementary School was taken by the teachers from the previous school

Robinson added that renaming the Chalk Hill school will allow staff and students to keep ‘their identity and a comfort level.’

The school where the shootings occurred remains closed and guarded by police. Newtown officials haven't decided yet on the building's future.

It's been nearly three weeks since the Dec. 14 massacre, when gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 students and six educators. Lanza also killed his mother at the home they shared in Newtown before the school shootings, which ended when Lanza fatally shot himself as police arrived. Police haven't released any details about a motive.

One parent took the opportunity during Wednesday's open house to thank a teacher for helping protect his son. Vinny Alvarez said the teacher, Courtney Martin, locked her classroom door and kept the children in a corner until it was safe to leave the building.

Numerous police officers on Wednesday guarded the outside of the Monroe school, which is about seven miles from the old school.

Asked about the level of security at the new school, Monroe police Lt. Keith White said, ‘I think right now it has to be the safest school in America.’

Sensitive: Sandy Hook students were invited to attend Chalk Hill middle school Wednesday ahead of classes on Thursday. The building has been re-purposed for them as they return to school for the first time since last month's shooting

Robinson said Chalk Hill School has been transformed into a ‘cheerful’ place for the surviving students to resume normal school routines. She said mental health counselors continue to be available for anyone who needs them.

‘They're so excited to see the teachers,’ Robinson said about the open house attendees.

Several signs welcoming the Sandy Hook students to their new school were posted along the road leading to the school in a rural, mostly residential neighborhood. One said ‘Welcome Sandy Hook Elementary Kids,’ while a similar sign added ‘You are in our prayers.’

Teams of workers, many of them volunteers, prepared the Chalk Hill school with fresh paint and new furniture and even raised bathroom floors so the smaller elementary school students can reach the toilets. The students' desks, backpacks and other belongings that were left behind following the shooting were taken to the new school to make them feel at home.

Early days: Teachers and volunteers have worked to remodel the middle school to appear as close as possible to Sandy Hook in order to reassure the children

Counselors say it's important for children to get back to a normal routine and for teachers and parents to offer sensitive reassurances.

When classes start, Robinson said teachers will try to make it as normal a school day as possible for the children.

‘We want to get back to teaching and learning,’ she said. ‘We will obviously take time out from the academics for any conversations that need to take place, and there will be a lot of support there. All in all, we want the kids to reconnect with their friends and classroom teachers, and I think that's going to be the healthiest thing.’

Acting Sandy Hook principal Donna Page wrote on the school's website: 'Be assured that the towns of Monroe and Newtown are working night and day to ensure the facility is safe, secure and fully operational for our return.'

Familiarity: Classes will resume at a re-purposed school in the neighboring town of Monroe, where measures have been put in place to make as many things as possible familiar to the children

Memorial: Local volunteers installed 26 stars on the roof of the Newtown fire house on January 1st in honor of the victims of the shooting

Ms Page took on the role after the elementary school's principal Dawn Hochsprung was killed in the attack.

She added that parents who wanted to come with their children to the first day of classes on Thursday would be made welcome.

Sandy Hook school in Newtown remains closed and has no date scheduled for reopening. It remains a crime scene following the December massacre.

Father David Connors said his eight-year-old triplets have suffered nightmares, jumped at noises and clung to their parents since they escaped the shooting. 

Mr Connors said: 'I'm nervous about it. It's unchartered waters for us. I know it's going to be difficult.'

Connors, a 40-year-old engineer, said he felt reassured after recently visiting the new setup. He said his children were excited to see their backpacks and coats, and that the family was greeted by a police officer at the door and grief counselors in the hallways.

Teachers will try to make it as normal a school day as possible for the children, schools Superintendent Robinson said.

'We want to get back to teaching and learning,' she said. 'We will obviously take time out from the academics for any conversations that need to take place, and there will be a lot of support there. All in all, we want the kids to reconnect with their friends and classroom teachers, and I think that's going to be the healthiest thing.'

Teachers are returning as well, and 
some have already been working on their classrooms. At some point, all 
those will be honored, but officials are still working out how and when 
to do so, Robinson said.

'Everyone was part and parcel of getting as many kids out of there safely as they could,' she said.

'Almost everybody did something to 
save kids. One art teacher locked her kids in the kiln room, and I got a
 message from her on my cellphone saying she wouldn't come out until she
 saw a police badge.'

After the evacuation, teachers 
grouped their children at a nearby fire station, Robinson said. One sang
 songs, while others read to the students, she said.

Julian Ford, a clinical psychologist 
at the University of Connecticut who helped counsel families in the days
 immediately following the shooting, recommended addressing it as 
questions come up but otherwise focusing on regular school work.

Fear: Parents are apprehensive about their children returning to school following the Sandy Hook shooting

Victims:
 Top row- (L-R) Ana Marquez-Greene, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos,

 Fourth row: (L-R) Grace McDonnell, James Mattioli, Avielle Richman, 
Rachel Davino, Anne Marie Murphy. Fifth row: (L-R) Lauren Rousseau, Mary
 Sherlach, Victoria Soto, Dawn Hochsprung, Nancy Lanza

'Kids just spontaneously make associations and will start talking about something that reminds them of someone, or that reminds them of some of the scary parts of the experience,' Ford said.

'They don't need a lot of words; they need a few selective words that are thoughtful and sensitive, like, ''We're going to be OK,'' and ''We really miss this person, but we'll always be able to think about her or him in ways that are really nice.'''

It will be important for parents and teachers to listen and be observant, Ford said.

'Each of the boys and girls are going to have different reactions to different aspects of the environment, different little things that will be reminders to them,' he said.

Parents might have a harder time with fear than children, Ford said.

Before the shooting, a babysitter would take Mr Connors' children to the bus stop. But Connors said he'll probably take the third-graders to the bus the first few days.

'I think that they need to get back into a normal routine as quickly as possible,' Connors said. 'If you're hovering over them at all times, it almost intensifies the fear for them.'
