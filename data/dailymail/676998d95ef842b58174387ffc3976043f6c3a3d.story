American scientists have invented the world's first ultrasound scanner for smartphones, which could revolutionise healthcare in countries where the technology is not widely available.

The MobiUS scanner plugs into smartphones and tablets to provide an instant scan image on the mobile device's screen.

Its inventors believe that the device's portability and small price tag could provide a breakthrough in medical care in third world countries.

Ultrasound scans use high frequency sound waves to create an image of body parts to help with diagnoses.

They are best known for their use during pregnancy to see the baby in the womb but are also used to scan organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, gall bladder and breasts.

However, ultrasound scanners are usually fairly large, expensive and situated in hospitals and clinics, which could be a long distance away from the people who need them in poorer countries.

To solve these problems, scientists spent three years developing the MobiUS, which can transmit images over a mobile network or WiFi.

The scanner is supplied with its own Windows tablet or smartphone, but its inventors are working on versions compatible with Apple and Android operating systems.

The MobiUS costs £7,000 compared to £60,000 for a full-size ultrasound model.

Sailesh Chutani, CEO of US creators MobiSante, said: 'Ultrasound imaging is safe, effective and can save lives, however more than 70 per cent of the world's population does not have access to ultrasound because it is expensive and not portable enough.

'Devices like MobiUS enable more care to be provided outside of expensive settings like hospitals into settings that are less expensive, such as clinics and other locations where the patient needs immediate care.

'This is key to improving access while reducing costs.'

He believes accurate and inexpensive diagnostics at the point of care is critical to reducing healthcare costs, while also improving outcomes.

Mr Chutani said that the MobiUS interface is extremely simple and can be mastered in just a few minutes.

'MobiUS has built in network connectivity which allows easy sharing of images from the device, for storage as well as for second opinion or remote diagnosis.

'The device starts in less than a minute and since it is battery powered, it can work off the electric grid.'

This could be extremely useful in poorer countries where power is limited or unreliable.

The company said: 'MobiUS fuses the power and wireless connectivity of a smartphone with the internet into a game-changing diagnostic solution that is personal and accessible.'

The MobiUS interface is simple to use so that nurses, such as the one pictured, can master it quickly. The system has built-in network connectivity that allows easy sharing of images from the device for second opinion or remote diagnosis. As it is battery powered it can work in areas without reliable power
