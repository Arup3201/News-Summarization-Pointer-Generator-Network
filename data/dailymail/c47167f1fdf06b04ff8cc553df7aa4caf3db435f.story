A model plunged 100ft to her death from a balcony at a hotel packed with delegates for the Labour Party conference.

Laura Pahomova, 23, is believed to have fallen from an apartment in the boutique hotel before landing nine floors below.

She crashed on to a window balcony suffering multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene in Manchester city centre.

Tragic: Laura Pahomova, 23, fell to her death at the Light Boutique ApartHotel in Manchester's Northern Quarter on Sunday

Yesterday police confirmed they were investigating the death of the model but said they were not treating it as suspicious.

She is thought to have been alone in 
the apartment at the time of the incident and may have been suffering 
personal problems in the days before her death.

Miss Pahomova, who spoke Russian, German, Latvian and English, came to the UK from Latvia several years ago to study.

She is believed to have taken her A-levels at a college in Blackburn.

She also launched herself as a model and had worked with several photographers and fashion designers in the region.

Although she lived in Blackburn, the 
23-year-old had rented a £99-a-night serviced apartment at the 
Manchester hotel, which last weekend was packed with delegates from the 
Labour conference being staged in the city.

The Light Boutique has 55 apartments located between floors six and 14, and several penthouse apartments.

Police are expected to study her 
Facebook page, on which she said: ‘I am the master of my faith, I am the
 captain of my soul. Normal life is boring.’ She listed her favourite 
quote as: ‘If you die in an elevator be sure to press the Up button’ – 
which was originally written by the late US satirist Sam Levenson.

The tragedy occurred at around 11.30am on Sunday when shocked guests heard her fall.

Dina Livingston, 24, who was in 
Manchester for the conference, said: ‘I was in my room having a nap when
 the police knocked on my door. They said a woman had fallen on to a 
balcony and died.

‘They were asking all the guests what they had seen.

‘I didn’t see anything myself but it’s harrowing for someone to lose their life like this.’

An eyewitness said: ‘It was quite a 
disturbing scene. There were loads of police cars, the street was closed
 off and there was tarpaulin covering the balcony.’

Shock: The 23-year-old plunged to her death from the ninth floor of the building

On the networking website Model 
Mayhem, Miss Pahomova described herself as a Blackburn-based model and 
wrote: ‘I am fun, enthusiastic, easygoing and have a funny accent.’ A 
flatmate at her home in Blackburn, who asked not to be named, said: 
‘Laura was my best friend. We are still trying to find out what 
happened, but the police said she fell.’

Photographer Dan Tyack, who had 
worked with Miss Pahomova, said: ‘She was a lovely girl. The last I 
heard from her she was in Latvia and thinking about coming back to the 
UK.’

Barry Griffiths, head of learner 
services at Blackburn College, said: ‘We are very saddened by this 
tragic news. To lose someone so young, and with her whole life in front 
of her, in such tragic circumstances is extremely distressing.’
