An 84-year-old man has allegedly shot dead his chronically ill wife and daughter-in-law before turning the gun on himself in a tragic 'mercy killing.'

Dan Crabtree, 80-year-old Carol Crabtree and 62-year-old Rita Delehanty were found dead in the elderly couple's home in Hacienda Heights, California, on Wednesday morning.

Jim Crabtree, 55, the couple's son and Delehanty's husband of 25 years, said all three suffered from chronic illnesses, which is what led to the apparent murder-suicide.

'This is the classic ending of three people with terminal illnesses,' he said.

Dead: Dan Crabtree, 84, pictured, allegedly shot dead his elderly wife Carol, right, and daughter-in-law before turning the gun on himself in a tragic 'mercy killing'

He explained that his wife suffered from mid-stage Alzheimer's, his father from early-stage Alzheimer's and his mother from debilitating chronic joint pain that forced her to use a wheelchair.

His wife's health was so bad that he had to wash and dress his wife every morning before dropping her off at his parents' home so he could go to work.

On Wednesday, he did the same, without any sign of trouble but, hours later, they were all dead.

Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives were still trying to determine the reason. Authorities found the three after a 911 call brought deputies to the quiet suburban neighborhood in Hacienda Heights.

Sheriff's Lt. Dave Dolson said investigators found the couple and their daughter-in-law with gunshots wounds.

Delehanty was dead in the living 
room, Carol Crabtree's body was in a powered wheelchair in the back 
bedroom and Dan Crabtree was barely alive on the backyard porch. A 
shotgun and handgun were found near him.

Supportive parents: Though Dan and Carol Crabtree, pictured right, were suffering from poor health, they agreed to care for their son's wife, Rita, pictured left some years ago, so he could work

'We believe it's a murder-suicide,' Dolson said. 'All evidence right now points to the fact that the husband likely shot and killed the daughter-in-law and his wife, and then shot himself.'

Investigators believe it was Dan Crabtree who may have made the 911 call indicating someone was shot at the house, Dolson said, but detectives didn't know the motive.

'At this point we really can't nail it down,' Dolson said. 'We may never.'

Though Dan and Carol Crabtree were suffering from poor health, they agreed to care for their son's wife so he could work.

His wife would have breakfast with 
her in-laws each morning, and Jim Crabtree would go to his job as a 
registered nurse who trained paramedics for the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services.

Later in the day, his parents would drop 
his wife off at her home about a mile away, and paid caregivers would 
take care of her until Crabtree returned.

Home: Jim Crabtree said all three suffered from chronic illnesses, which is what led to the apparent murder-suicide at the home, pictured

Crabtree
 spoke outside his parents' home on Wednesday about his wife's 
progressively worsening Alzheimer's over the last seven years.

Delehanty had also been a nurse, but she had to stop working five years ago because of her illness.

The two had been married 25 years and never had kids, he said.

'My
 wife didn't know who I was. My wife didn't know we were married,' 
Crabtree said. 'You try to help her, she yells, she screams, she hits 
you.'

Crabtree
 wore a white tie on Wednesday with a purple ribbon on it that said 'I 
wear purple for my wife' and pledged Alzheimer's awareness.

'The pain and misery that comes with this dementia, until you lived it, you don't get it,' Crabtree said.

He said caregivers cost him $2,000 a month and none of it was covered by insurance.

After
 years of withering emotional drain caring for his wife, he said he was 
somewhat relieved it was all over. As he had looked into the future, he 
had wondered how it was going to end.

Hard: Jim Crabtree, pictured, said on Wednesday her condition had deteriorated: 'My wife didn't know who I was. My wife didn't know we were married'

Shocked: Neighbors were shocked and described the family as friendly

'When somebody dies, you don't want to go out and say I'm overjoyed my parents and my wife are dead, but in some cases, my wife died years ago,' Crabtree said.

Marjorie Bauer was in her house a block away when she heard a single gunshot shortly before 9 a.m.

She
 was speaking with her neighbors George and Alice Parrish about what 
happened, while looking over at the police tape on Wednesday afternoon. 
All three have lived in the area for many decades.

'It's shocking,' said Alice Parrish. 'You don't expect it in your own backyard.'

The Crabtrees were friendly with their neighbors, and were known to bicker, or 'fuss and carry on,' said George Parrish.

Residents would see Carol Crabtree out taking walks, but more recently, she was rarely seen.

'She couldn't walk anymore, she was in a lot of pain,' Alice Parrish said.
