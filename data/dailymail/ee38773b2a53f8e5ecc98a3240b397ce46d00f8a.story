A spectacular array of motoring history has been housed all under one roof as 200 classic cars, motorbikes and even a plane that featured in Oscar-winning Hollywood blockbuster 'Out of Africa' go under the hammer in Paris tomorrow.

British auction house Bonhams has gathered an astounding collection of luxury cars featuring the most prestigious names in the motorcar and motorcycle world for its annual sale. 

The collection, which is already on display in the Nave at the Grand Palais, includes classic designs by Bugatti, Aston Martin, Rolls Royce, Jaguar, Ferrari, Bentley and many others.

Motorcar history: The Bugatti type 54, raced by legendary driver Achille Varzi at Monza in 1931, is estimated to fetch more than £2million at auction

Varied: An incredible collection of 200 vintage cars and motorcycles has been put together for the auction at the Grand Palais in Paris tomorrow

Unique: A 1929 Gipsy Moth de Havilland plane piloted by Robert Redford in the hit film Out of Africa is also up for auction

Bonhams describes the sale as 'a celebration of the genius of the French automobile industry, and a return to a tradition at the Grand Palais that saw 48 Motor Shows between 1901 and 1961.'

Incredibly, 16 of the classic cars made across seven decades were all owned by just one man. The Charles H Brown collection is expected to raise in the region of £1.3million.

A former Grand Prix Bugatti Type 54, which was raced at Monza on 6th September 1931 in the hands of Achille Varzi, is expected to be a star attraction with bidding estimated to go over £2million.

Another classic car to go under the hammer is a 1953 Bentley R-Type Continental Sports Saloon described by Autocar as: 'A new stage in the evolution of the post-war Bentley.' 

Luxurious: The emblem 'Spirit of Ecstasy' is seen on a 1969 Rolls Royce Phantom VI Limousine at the exhibition

Quite a show: A 1934 Brough Superior 996cc SS100 classic motorbike is among the collection expected to attract motoring enthusiasts from around the world

All lined up: 16 of the vintage vehicles up for sale were all owned by just one - very careful - driver

The R-Type was one of the first Rolls-Royce available with automatic transmission. It can hit 50mph in just 10 seconds despite weighing nearly two tons and reach a top speed of 120mph.

The car is estimated to sell for between £470,000 and £650,000.

One of the rarer cars to go under the hammer is the 1928 Rolls-Royce Phantom I Playboy Roadster - one of just 28 ever built - and expected to fetch between £250,000 and £320,000.

The New Phantom (retrospectively known as the Phantom I) was introduced by Rolls-Royce in 1925 to replace the Silver Ghost. 

Pristine condition: Many of the cars up for auction are in perfect condition and can still be driven

Sneak peek: Enthusiasts were today allowed to look around the rare collection ahead of the auction tomorrow

All going on a summer holiday: This 1972 Fiat 500L is already fully-equipped with a fishing rod and a pair of skis

One of the more unique items up for sale is a 1929 De Havilland 60GMW Gipsy Moth aeroplane which featured in the Oscar-winning Hollywood blockbuster 'Out of Africa' starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.

The 1929 De Havilland DH 60GMW Gipsy Moth bi-plane was flown by character Denys Finch Hatton - played by Robert Redford - over the Kenyan savannah in the seven-time Oscar-winning 1985 film.

The yellow and black two-seater plane is in excellent condition with a permit to fly. Bidding is expected to be in excess of £120,000.

Futuristic: A 1937 Cord 812 S/C Phaeton is one of the more outlandish cars at the Retromobile vintage car show in Paris

In the driver's seat: A rare 1922 Amilcar Type 4C Skiff was one of the first ever built by the French company
