Angella Johnson gave up alcohol for the experiment

A few cups of coffee, an evening glass of wine, and saying yes to dessert – can these everyday pleasures be considered vices? 

Increasingly, doctors suggest we would be healthier if we didn’t indulge so regularly. 

New NHS guidelines announced last month suggest that those who drink just a couple of large glasses of wine a night should be offered drug addiction medication to help them break the habit. 

There is also a concerted push to reduce our sugar consumption, and coffee has been strongly linked to the rising incidence of anxiety disorders, which now affect one in 20 of the population. 

Javed Sabir, the Pathology Clinical Lead at BMI Healthcare, says that even short breaks from such common vices will yield health benefits and could break the cycle of regarding so-called treats such as chocolate, wine and coffee as rewards. 

‘These may seem like harmless things to help get you through the  day or a reward in the evening, but we don’t realise just how much damage they are doing to our bodies in the long term.’ 

He adds: ‘Giving up some of these common vices, even for just a few months, can make a big difference to your health, as our experiment shows.

 ‘It’s easier said than done for most of us and it’s only when you try to give them up that you realise they are very real addictions. 

‘As with our three guinea pigs, what can often happen is that one addictive substance is replaced with another. 

‘Of course, to see long-term benefits you have to sustain that good work and keep motivated. 

Our volunteers underwent a battery of health checks as part of a BMI Healthcare advanced assessment (bmihealthcare.co.uk) which measured their weight, blood pressure, body fat percentage, blood glucose levels, and waist/height ratio. 

They then gave up their chosen ‘vice’ for three months. Each was offered sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), a psychological treatment recommended by the NHS to help support addicts, but encouraged to make no other changes to their lifestyle. 

At the end of the experiment, they were tested again. Their results were analysed by nutritional therapist Jackie Lynch (well-well-well. co.uk) and personal trainer Scott Laidler.

‘That can be a real challenge and sticking to everything in moderation may be a more sustainable lifestyle change.’

I'm back in control and looking much better

Angella Johnson , who is in her 40s, is single and lives in London. She says: ‘In recent years I’ve found myself drinking more. 

At first it was to help ease the stress of the day, but it became a habit as my nightly tipple increased to two or three glasses. 

‘I wanted to feel in control once more, and it was surprisingly easy for the first four days. But after that I started to crave a large glass of chilled white wine. I stayed home in the evenings to avoid temptation. 

‘By week two the sight of someone drinking on TV or just reading about it in a book brought on the thirst. I drank coconut water by the litre. 

When I ventured out, I stuck valiantly to mineral water. For a treat I drank spicy Virgin Marys, but I yearned for alcohol. 

‘I chose not to have CBT – I prefer to be left to my own devices. The end of week three left me feeling more comfortable, but envy still hit me in a social settings where others were drinking. At home, quality chocolates were my late-night replacement. 

‘After six weeks, during which I thought of drinking at least once a day, friends and colleagues started to point out that my eyes were clearer, my face was less puffy, and that I had lost weight. I realised I was feeling more energetic. 

It was vanity that made me continue because I cannot say that it got any easier. Clearly my addiction had deep roots. It’s six weeks since I started drinking again and I have reset the valve. When I have alcohol, it’s for the taste, not the effect. I am once again in control.’

VERDICT 

Writer Chris Henry gave up sugar for three months

Jackie Lynch says: ‘The NHS is planning to offer women who drink five units of alcohol a day – that’s a couple of large glasses of wine – addiction medication to reduce the numbers of patients with an alcohol-related illness. Many middle-class professionals think drinking this much is pretty normal. It’s not. The advantages from reducing intake, besides reducing the risk of heart and liver disease, diabetes and stroke, is it will make a rapid difference to your shape – as Angella has discovered. She would have seen even more progress if she hadn’t drunk so much coconut water because a litre contains the equivalent of 12 teaspoons of sugar.’ 

Scott Laidler says: ‘Her already high levels of cholesterol have increased, and I’d suggest warrant medical investigation – perhaps she turned to comfort foods high in saturated fats, but there could be an underlying genetic cause. Even if she did need medication, her numbers could be lowered with the correct food choices in combination with regular exercise.’

I went sugar-free...and dropped two trouser sizes

Chris Henry, 42, is single and lives in Hove. He says: ‘How hard can it be to quit sugar? 

The answer is it’s incredibly difficult. Sugar is in everything, from the obvious cakes and biscuits to shop-bought soups. 

On the first day I left the shop with just asparagus and cheese. Midmorning and after dinner was when my sweet cravings were worse and I had to fight the urge for a bar of chocolate. I had headaches and felt lethargic – I just didn’t think sugar had that kind of power. 

‘CBT helped me break the pattern of rewarding myself with sweet snacks, but the main motivator was mathematical – I learned to work out how much added sugar is in food and picture it as teaspoons. 

Going to the pub was fine – red wine is naturally low in sugar. But I avoided eating out as I couldn’t face opting for a salad. ‘Going sugar-free meant a more traditional meat-and-veg diet. I lost 7lb in ten days. 

At the end of the experiment I bought a cake and a Chinese takeaway, but didn’t touch either. My tastebuds have changed – even sliced bread is too sweet. I am almost two trouser sizes smaller and feel so much better.’ 

VERDICT 

Antonia Hoyle gave up caffeine for the experiment 

Jackie says:  ‘Chris has done himself huge favours as his waist was heading towards 35in, the size linked to development of diabetes. His blood pressure has improved dramatically – the body breaks down sugar and converts it into energy and this may increase the heart rate if consumption is excessive. 

‘Sugars can build up in the liver, impairing function – so that’s why this reading improved. ‘The rise in cholesterol might be down to the cheese – he needs to ensure his diet is rich in soluble fibre which binds to and excretes cholesterol in the gut. He should also aim to increase essential fats from foods such as oily fish and nuts.’

Scott says: Sugar and white foods such as chips and buns are addictive. People use sweet treats to make themselves feel better emotionally. 

The fast-release energy they provide can’t all be utilised by a typically sedentary person with a desk job, so it’s stored as fat. Once you wean your tastebuds away from sweet things, it’s easy to break the bond. Hopefully the huge positives Chris has experienced will help keep him from relapsing.’

Quitting coffee left me calmer - but fatter

Antonia Hoyle, 36, lives in London with her husband Chris and two children. She says: ‘I knew I was a caffeine addict, drinking four coffees, three cups of tea and two cans of sugar-free cola a day to cope with the demands of being a working mother. 

But reading reports linking the drug – yes, it is – to anxiety rang so very true. I also suffered constant headaches. 

‘The first week was hellish: I was light-headed, irritable and overcome by waves of tiredness. CBT sessions helped remind me that these side effects were normal. 

After that my headaches stopped and I slept better overnight. I felt less anxious and my moods were much more even. 

‘But I felt flat. There was nothing to look forward to in the mornings. Decaf tea tasted like fish and herbal tea was unsatisfying. Instead of espressos I’d resort to the biscuit barrel or chocolate to perk me up. 

My evening cola was replaced with a couple of glasses of wine. My weight crept up as a result. Within a week of the experiment ending, I was back to two cups of tea and cup of coffee a day. I’ve decided caffeine is one drug that can be enjoyed in moderation.’

VERDICT 

Jackie says: ‘Caffeine is a stimulant and Antonia was consuming to excess – 400mg a day is the upper recommended limit and she was downing more than twice this, which was exacerbating her anxiety. 

The drop in blood pressure is a result of her giving up. It’s typical that she substituted it with another stimulant: sugar. 

Rehab clinics ban sweets because drug addicts often gorge on sugary snacks when their primary vice is removed, and she’s lucky she didn’t put on even more weight. I suspect she isn’t eating a balanced diet with enough complex carbohydrates to sustain her energy levels.’ 

Scott says: ‘All that caffeine was being processed by the liver, which also regulates cholesterol levels. Now that the organ can focus on its primary job, her levels have fallen too. But I suspect she’ll slip back into her old ways if she doesn’t tackle the issues driving her problem.’
