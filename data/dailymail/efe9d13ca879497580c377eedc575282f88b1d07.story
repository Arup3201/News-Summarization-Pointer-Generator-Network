A student is counting the cost of cheap drinks promotions today after video of her dancing naked in an inflatable paddling pool at a nightclub went viral on the internet.

The university student - who MailOnline has chosen not to identify - woke up this morning to find that a 10-minute video of the incident at Oceana nightclub in Cardiff had been circulated widely on Twitter.

A student - who is not being identified by MailOnline - has been left embarrassed after a video of her stripping off in a nightclub went viral

Her behaviour is a classic example of Britain's binge-drinking culture - and the embarrassment it can cause.

And the speed with which her drunken antics went viral highlights the power of social media.

A one-minute version was available on YouTube and attracted more than 1,000 hits in less than 10 minutes. It has now been removed.

The 20-year-old took part in a wet T-shirt contest as part of the Missbehaviour event - billed as 'Cardiff's naughtiest night' - where vodka and other spirits cost just £1.75 for a double.

At the event, which boasts the cheapest drinks in Cardiff, bottles of lager and alcopops were on sale at £1.20. 

While other girls thought it enough to remove their tops, the student stripped off entirely and frolicked in the inflatable paddling pool.

With another reveller filming the 'contest' on a mobile phone, she leans over the edge of the pool plays for the cameras.

The Rihanna song S&M plays loudly in the background as men cheer and chant 'Off, off, off.'

As the student is exposing herself herself, the MC uses his microphone to shout: 'Get em 'off'.

The shame-faced student, who had clearly been drinking, used her Twitter account to send a message a day later which read: 'Yes I got drunk and yes I got naked.

'We all do things we regret and there is nothing I can do about it now!'

The embarrassed student later Tweeted that she had also lost her underwear, her earrings and had not been given £50 prize money for the wet T-shirt competition.

She was too embarrassed to comment when contacted to comment.

Student Luke Brown, 23, said: 'There 
was a lot of cheering going on and I looked around to see a naked girl 
in the paddling pool.

The student later posted this tweet of regret about the incident

'She seemed to be having a good time and everyone was reaching for their mobile phones to video her.

'I think the club staff stepped in to cover her up but I’ve seen one of the videos on twitter and it lasts for 10 minutes.

'Everyone had a lot to drink - I’ll bet she’s regretting it now.'

A spokesman for the Oceana club said: 'The night in question was a promoter event - this is where the event is put on and run by a third party.

'Oceana does not condone such behaviour.

The embarrassing antics took place at Oceana nightclub in Cardiff

'The Oceana door team dealt with the incident at the time and the clubs management has had the appropriate conversation with the promoter regarding this.'

The video of the student in the paddling pool has now been removed from YouTube.

Chris
Sorek, from alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'There's nothing wrong with enjoying a
few drinks on a night out.

'But the digital world we live in means that people
who have been drinking to excess can have their actions come back to haunt them
online.

'What might appear fun when drunk can feel foolish and embarrassing in
the cold light of day.

'Drinkaware research shows that over a
third [38 per cent] of 18-24 year-olds admit to experiencing "cybershame" - regretting
something they've posted online when drinking on a night out.

'And 47 per cent of those
polled admit to un-tagging drunk photos of themselves they didn't want
others to see.

'Thirty eight per cent also reported feeling embarrassed about seeing pictures of
themselves online doing things they don't remember after a night of excessive
drinking.'

He added: 'There
are simple ways to prevent a night taking a turn for the worse and avoid seeing
embarrassing posts and pictures splashed over the internet the next day. Eating
a meal before drinking or when out and making every third drink a soft one can
make the difference between having a good night or a bad one.'

The Prime Minister has demanded each unit of alcohol be sold for no less than 40p to 50p in Britain's supermarkets (picture posed by models)

Alcohol will be sold with a minimum price to deter binge drinking under plans ordered by David Cameron.

The Prime Minister has demanded each unit of alcohol be sold for no less than 40p to 50p in Britain’s supermarkets.

The
proposals, which Mr Cameron wants included in an alcohol strategy paper
to be published in February, will cost drinkers £700million a year.

The Prime Minister has repeatedly said he wants a minimum price to help tackle Britain’s obesity and binge drinking epidemic.

Government sources said he has overruled Health Secretary Andrew 
Lansley, who favoured a voluntary system for retailers, and is insisting
that the basement price be imposed by law.

The scheme will mirror one introduced in Scotland, where the sale of alcohol below 45p a unit is banned.

It
will be accompanied by a public health campaign on television to 
persuade people to moderate their alcohol intake. Extra tax revenue 
raised from the plans will be ploughed back into the NHS.

But
the strategy paper has been delayed as a result of arguments in 
government about how to impose the change, which critics will challenge 
as a nanny state measure.

Government
lawyers have warned that an attempt to impose legal restrictions on 
alcohol costs could fall foul of EU competition laws.

Home
Secretary Theresa May, whose department deals with much of the fallout 
from binge drinking on Britain’s streets, wants to tax drink on the 
basis of alcoholic units.

The Department of Business has warned that forcing firms to charge a minimum price could be illegal.

There is also disagreement about 
whether the minimum price would just be imposed on cheap supermarket 
alcohol, or whether pubs would be targeted too. Some ministers are 
concerned that would hit responsible drinkers too.

Beer
and lager is currently taxed at 18p a unit, compared with 19p a unit 
for wine and about 25p a unit for standard spirits. VAT, charged at 20 
per cent, is also added.

A
recent official study found that setting a minimum price of 30p per 
unit would prevent 300 deaths a year, 40p about 1,000 deaths, and 50p 
more than 2,000 premature deaths.

In August 2010, Mr Cameron 
said the cut-price drinks offers in supermarkets had turned town centres
into the ‘Wild West’.

He
said: ‘There is a problem with very cheap alcohol, alcohol being bought
at convenience stores and supermarkets that people are using to what’s 
called "pre-load" before they go out. And this is a problem you just 
can’t ignore.

‘We’ve 
got a situation where in some supermarkets you can walk in and buy 
incredibly cheap drinks, a lot of which is high strength lager, which  
people are using to get off their heads before they even go out.’

Last
year, the number of patients admitted to hospital for problems caused 
by drinking topped the one million mark for the first time.
