Brett Ewins says he cannot recall alleged attack

A renowned comic artist who drew Judge Dredd tried to slash a police officer’s throat after he was called to a disturbance at his house, a court heard.

Police went to investigate after hearing shouting and ranting coming from the west London home of Brett Ewins, 56, best known for his work on the Judge Dredd and Rogue Trooper strips in the acclaimed comic 2000 AD.

They were confronted by Ewins wielding a four-inch kitchen knife when they went inside, Isleworth Crown Court was told.

To defend themselves PC Andrew McKelvie and his partner Matthew Harries sprayed Ewins with pepper spray and hit him twice on the arm but he kept coming at them, a jury heard.

Fearing for their lives one of the officer’s struck Ewins around the head with his baton but still Ewins came at them, the court was told.

Ewins suffered a heart attack after finally being restrained, the court heard.

David Allan, prosecuting, said: 'At that point Mr Ewins attempted to stab one of the officers in the throat, but in fact he stabbed him in the arm.

'It was with such force the knife was buried right up to the handle inside the officer’s arm.'

Mr Allen added: 'This all happened on January 14 this year at around 8.30am on a Saturday morning.

'Two police officers were called to an 
address in Hanwell, west London. While they were there they heard Mr 
Ewins shouting and ranting next door.

'They went into his house to try to 
prevent a beach of the peace. When the officer’s went inside the 
defendant grabbed a kitchen knife, like the type used to cut vegetables,
and began to get very aggressive.

'The
officers sprayed him with CS spray but it had no effect. One of the 
officers then struck him on the arm twice with his asp but still it did 
not stop him.

The artist, who is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and takes medication, used to draw the Judge Dredd and Rogue Trooper cartoons

'When the officer thought he was in imminent danger of being stabbed he struck him on the head.

'Mr Ewins stabbed towards his neck, but the officer put his arm up to try and protect himself and the knife plunged into his arm.'

The court heard the injured officer was able to escape and PC Harries restrained Ewins on the floor until back up arrived.

Mr Allan continued: 'As a result of that Mr Ewins suffered a cardiac arrest outside the property.

The jury has heard how the artist 'attacked' the police officers who were investigating shouts

'He was given CPR by the police officers and paramedics and taken to hospital where he remained for three weeks until he made a recovery.'

When Ewins, who now walks with a walking stick, was interviewed about the incident he said he could not remember any of it.

The artist, who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and is on medication, is charged with grievous bodily harm with intent.

He admits stabbing the officer, but claims he was acting involuntarily after being struck on the head.

An expert witness for the defence will say the blow sent him into a state of unconsciousness similar to sleepwalking so he did not know what he was doing.

Mr Allan told the jury: 'The defence are not going to be suggesting that he was insane rather he did not know what he was doing.

'We say you can infer from the way he was behaving and common sense that when he stabbed this officer in the arm he intended to cause him really serious bodily harm.'

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
