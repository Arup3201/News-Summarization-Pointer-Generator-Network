Eight siblings and their mother died in an early morning house fire caused by an electrical baseboard heater when temperatures dipped to 1 degree in rural Greenville, Kentucky.

The home belonged to 36-year-old Chad Watson, his 35-year-old wife Larae Watson and their nine kids ranging in age from 4-15.

Mr Watson and his 11-year-old daughter Kylie escaped the burning building and are being treated for burns and smoke inhalation at Vanderbilt University Medical Center's trauma center in Nashville where both are listed in critical but stable condition.

The bodies of mother Larae and children Madison, 15, Kaitlyn, 14, Morgan, 13, Emily, 9, Samuel, 8, Raegan, 6, and 4-year-old twins Mark and Nathaniel were all recovered from the burned-down building.

Police say that 11 people were inside the house when a neighbor called to report the fire around 2am. The small home had no more than three bedrooms, meaning the family was 'piled-up' in the small living space.

By the time firefighters arrived, the home was already 'fully engulfed' in flames.

Neighbor Clarence Humphrey told WBKO that she woke up to the sound of sirens and saw flames.

'I knew they weren't getting out. I just froze - went numb really,' Ms Humphrey said.

Investigators are looking into what caused the blaze, but said  that it doesn't appear suspicious in nature.

Recke said it's still too early to know what caused the fire but that last night's cold temperatures could be to blame. Temperatures went all the way down to 1 degree last night, in a region accustomed to 35 degree weather in January. 

'I'm thinking that they probably, maybe had space heaters because of this weather,' Recke told NBC.

Neighbor Laura Bennett said it was so cold that when firefighters arrived, the water turned to ice as they started to put out the flames. 

She says 8-year-old Samuel Watson, who died in the fire, was over the night before to play with her daughter.

'He went home and then 10 hours later he's gone,' she said.

The Watson home was the only one damaged in the area.

Greenville is a small rural community of 4,000 about 130 miles southeast of Louisville.

Mayor Ed DeArmond described it as a day of sadness for the entire community.

Recke said it was the type of community where 'everybody knows everybody'.

Reports
 of the fire even reached U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell,
 who represents Kentucky, and he expressed his condolences to the family
 on the Senate floor.

'Elaine
 and I are hopeful for a speedy recovery for the two victims still 
alive. And we extend out prayers and condolences to the families of the 
souls lost in this destructive fire. I will pay close attention to this 
story as events further develop.

'The
 entire Commonwealth stands beside Muhlenberg County right now, and 
we'll do whatever we can to help you recover from this horrific loss.'
