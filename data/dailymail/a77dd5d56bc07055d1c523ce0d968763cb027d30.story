Seats should be ripped out on the most overcrowded train services to create cheaper ‘standing only’ carriages, ministers have been urged.

The railways should follow the model of budget airlines like Ryanair and easyjet who offer cheap, no-frills travel in contrast to the high-end services run by the likes of British Airways or even private jets.

Passengers in the new economy class carriages would pay up to 20 per cent less than those sitting in standard class, under plans drawn up by the Institute for Economic Affairs.

It is claimed that a return to third-class travel for the first time since 1956 would be a cheaper way to ease crowding than spending billions on new lines and stations.

Transport expert David Starkie, who wrote the report for the IEA, argues rail commuters should be given more choice about the quality of service and the price they pay.

‘An additional high-density “economy class” section could be introduced on commuter trains, access to which would be priced during the peak at a large discount to current fares.

‘From the resource cost point of view, there would be more passengers on a standard-length train without the recourse to high levels of taxpayer-funded investment in expensive new infrastructure.’

Third
class travel first became an option in 1838. Six years later an act of 
parliament forced train companies to provide a roof in third class.

The
1844 Railway Act stipulated that all third-class passengers should be 
carried in covered accommodation. Railway companies also began providing
lighting in third-class carriages. However, whereas there were several 
oil lamps in the first class carriages, third-class carriages only had 
one.

In 1844 the railways introduced Parly & Gov class for government workers.

The Pullman car, introduced in Britain in 1874, created a new level of comfort.

Midland
Railway abolished second class travel in 1875, upgrading third class 
passengers to second class standards. Other railways followed the 
example.

Second class disappeared from fare tables until 
1956, when third class was renamed second. British Rail later renamed 
this standard class.

Passengers already crowd at the front of trains arriving at the final destination, even if there are empty seats at the rear, because they want to beat the crush at ticket barriers.

The report proposes introducing an ‘additional high-density section to commuter trains’ of three carriages which would be 20 per cent cheaper than the standard peak price.

‘A discount of this amount would place the price of “economy class” about mid-way between the standard class rail fare and the fare for commuter coaches,’ the report said.

The discount could be less for shorter journeys and more for longer commutes.

The carriages could be modelled on London Overground trains service, with flip-down seats running down the edge but with most room giving over to standing space.

It would mean trains could carry more people without investing in additional rolling stock or lengthening platforms.

It could even be cheaper to run the new trains. ‘Stripped of seat furniture train carriages would be lighter,’ the report said.

It would also be ‘substantially’ quicker for passengers to board and get off the train, with the potential to improve service reliability.

It is claimed all passengers would enjoy the benefits of the new third class service. Those choosing the economy class would save money, while those opting for a seat would ‘enjoy higher service quality not having to share their space with standing passengers’.

It could mark the return of the drinks trolley to standard class carriages if overcrowding in the aisles was reduced.

The report suggests the discounted ticket should not cost train companies money, because more passengers would be able to board each service.

Crush: The Institute for Economic Affairs argues that too many people are already forced to stand in carriages where seats take up too much space

Last month the Department for Transport insisted it was not planning to reintroduce  third-class travel after leaked plans to re-privatise the East Coast main line from London to Aberdeen included proposals for three different classes of travel.

Ministers have suggested it could be an additional class of travel between the existing first and standard classes – broadly equivalent to a 'premium economy' class on airlines.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin also proposed stripping out first class carriages from busy routes to make more room for standard ticket holders.
