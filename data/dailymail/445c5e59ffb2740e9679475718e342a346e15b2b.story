EasyJet passengers in France are facing disruption as flight attendants from the budget airline’s French branch plan to walk off the job over the Christmas holiday.

The workers are planning to strike from 12:01am on Christmas Day to 11:59pm on Boxing Day in a dispute over pay and work schedules.

Francois Bacchetta, general director of easyJet’s operations in France, said the Luton-based airline expects to cancel less than half of its flights from French airports.

He said: ‘On Monday, we will pre-emptively cancel a certain number of flights in order to transfer passengers, so they can adjust their plans.’ 

There are no flights scheduled on Christmas Day, so the labour action will only affect travellers on Boxing Day.

Aviation workers are required to announce strikes 48 hours in advance, meaning EasyJet will know the extent of the cancellations on Tuesday.

In a statement, easyJet told MailOnline Travel that it ‘will do everything possible’ to minimise the disruption for travellers, although some flights will be cancelled.

Passengers on the affected flights will be contacted and offered a full refund or the opportunity to rebook at no cost.

EasyJet apologised to passengers and said it will issue a final cancellation list on Christmas Eve once it has final details from the SNPNC and UNAC cabin crew unions.

The airline said: ‘On 26 December easyJet had more than 1,200 flights scheduled to operate.

‘The strike action will affect French domestic flights and currently no UK touching flights are cancelled. EasyJet will assure a minimum service on every route affected by cancellation.’

The carrier added: ‘EasyJet crews are in the vast majority employed under permanent contract and among the best remunerated crew in France.

‘Every year easyJet conducts negotiations with its employees and their representatives and this strike has been called while the negotiations have just begun. EasyJet remains open and committed to find a suitable resolution with the unions.’ 

The walkout will affect travellers on Boxing Day as there are no flights scheduled on Christmas Day

Laurent Nicolas, a representative of the SNPNC-FO union that represents 600 easyJet flight attendants, said workers are upset over schedules that ‘can change 20 times per month’.

He said the scheduling makes it impossible for employees to spend quality time with their families.

The union argues that the airline can afford a pay increase for flight attendants as its operating profits were up 21 per cent this year, reaching €728m (approximately £571m).

That has translated into huge bonuses for management and income that is up to 300 times the average salary of an easyJet flight attendant, the union claims.

Mr Bacchetta acknowledged the demands of the industry are ‘complicated’ and that he understood the ‘frustration’ of workers.

But he was less understanding with complaints over salaries, and he said annual negotiations are underway.
