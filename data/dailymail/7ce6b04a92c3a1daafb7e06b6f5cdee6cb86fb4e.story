Ordinary homeowners will be end up being ‘clobbered’ by Labour’s mansion tax, George Osborne claimed yesterday.

The Chancellor dismissed Opposition claims that the annual levy would apply only to homes worth £2million or more, insisting it would end up being charged at far lower property valuations.

Ed Balls gave further details about who will be hit by the charge yesterday, saying it would be staggered so that the owners of the most valuable properties are hardest hit.

Clash: Ed Balls and George Osborne fought it out over Labour's mansion tax on the Andrew Marr show

The Shadow Chancellor put forward bands of £2million, £3million, £10million and £50million with charges increasing progressively the higher the band.

This suggests that those in the most expensive houses will be hit with bills for tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds a year.

Earlier this month Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, was forced to defend the tax from a savage attack from the singer Myleene Klass.

She confronted him on a TV show, complaining that the levy would hit ‘grannies’ who had little income and pointing out that £2million would not pay for much in some parts of London.

Mr Balls insisted that safeguards would be put in place to exempt asset rich, cash poor homeowners, such as low-income pensioners who bought homes that have increased dramatically in value.

The proposed £2million threshold will be raised in line with high end property prices.

The Liberal Democrats have long been in favour of a similar form of mansion tax, and the policy is expected to be introduced quickly if there is a Lib-Lab coalition after May’s general election.

Mr Balls told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme yesterday: ‘People with houses of £50million or £10million can afford to pay a bit more, and they are going to under the next Labour government.

‘The vast majority of properties in London and across the country will not pay. But don’t you think it is fair, especially when so many foreign investors are investing in our housing market, and when you have much lower tax rates on highest value properties than other houses?

‘We need some money to save the National Health Service – that’s what we are going to deliver. Most people think it is fair, whatever Myleene Klass thinks.

‘We are going to graduate it, it is going to be a progressive tax ... over £3million, over £10million, over £50million it will more than proportionally increase.

‘It will be progressive so it is going to be steered, staged and tiered but it will be fair.

‘Nobody watching your programme with a house worth less than £2million will pay.

‘Most people think a tax on properties above £2million is fair to save the National Health Service.’

The Chancellor said: ‘It’s not a mansion tax. It’s a tax on people’s homes. And of course they come on this show and tell you it’s for people with houses worth £10million or £50million.

‘Once Labour introduce a homes tax, it will be people with homes worth a fraction of that who will be clobbered with it.’
