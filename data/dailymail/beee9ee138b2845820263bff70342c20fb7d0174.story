The haunting blog of a musician  - detailing his battle with depression and telling his loved ones 'not to be sad I'm gone'- has appeared online days after he died.

It is believed Brett
 Robertshaw timed the post for after his death - with the line: 'If this post is live 
I’m probably not here any more.'

The talented musician was found in his bedroom in Blackpool, Lancashire, by his aunt on July 5 - seven days before the blog appeared.

The haunting blog of musician Brett Robertshaw detailing his battle with depression and telling his loved ones 'not to be sad I'm gone' has appeared online, days after he died

It is believed he set up up a delay on the post going live. It chronicled the 21-year-old’s fight with depression and the stigma attached to it.

Mr Robertshaw wrote: 'I’ve felt nothing towards family members, friends, or otherwise acquainted people, as much as I’ve felt that I should, like any normal functioning being.

'No matter how many good things happened to me or the people surrounding me, I didn’t seem to feel any positive emotion at all.

'The truth is, I’ve felt suicidal since I was in high school, and told nobody of it until very recently. The only comfort to me for the past six to seven years has been knowing that if I don't get better, if I can’t deal with things, or if things become too much for me to cope with, I have a way out.

'It may seem strange to read, but I guess I saw death as my best pal.

'Nobody is to blame for this, except myself. It’s entirely my own fault, and only my own lack of willpower and strength of mind is to blame. My inability to cope with things is the killer here.

The talented musician was found in his bedroom in Blackpool, Lancashire, by his aunt on July 5 - seven days before the blog appeared

'Don't be sad that I’m gone, just be happy that I’m not suffering any longer.'

Now his mother is pleading with other troubled people to seek help after her 'loving, caring and sensitive' son wrote about his own tragic death.

Cheryl Robertshaw, 46, said: 'We thought if we could raise some awareness about mental health problems, that there is help out there, but people need to be made aware of it.

'Phone numbers and things are not given to people and if it can raise awareness for one other family, can help somebody and their family and stop them going down the route that Brett did - just anything to help.

'It can stop a family going through what we are going through at the moment.'

In the blog, found by police, the games store worker talked about his concerns about maintaining friendships, anti-depressants, his use of alcohol, his attempts at finding help and bullying at school, which he said sparked his depression.

Mrs Robertshaw said: 'He talked to me about how he felt - he went out at 3am in the morning once. I texted him saying come home and he did. When he came back he broke down crying, saying "I’ve got depression".

'He said "nothing feels like it should". I checked with him every day and he would say he was OK. He said he didn't want to worry me - it was the type of lad he was.

'The day before he died he came bounding down the stairs saying "old woman are you not in bed yet?" He had a wicked sense of humour.

'He came down to let the dog out - absolutely no different to usual. I had to go to hospital and could hear him pottering about. I spoke to him, told him where I was going and that was the last I heard of him.'

She added: 'Open up and talk to anyone - there is help out there. There are 
organisations out there - so many organisations. If you are feeling that
 way there is extra help. We want to get the message out there For 
friends, for family, there is help out there.

'For that one person, if it helps it is worth it.'

His body was found by his aunty, Kelly Dixon, 35, in his bedroom.

She said: 'I think that is another thing, the fact that it did take him a long, long time to pluck up the courage to speak to a doctor, because there is such a stigma. He was such a young lad, it is not something often spoken about and the fact he was on medication and had been referred for counselling, but these things take so long.

It is believed Mr Robertshaw timed the post to go online after his death - with the opening line: 'If this post is live I'm probably not here any more'

'There is not enough help for them out there.'

'It was devastating when I found him. The blog made us understand what he was going through - he left a note to the family.

'It was a shock a week later when the blog was posted, saying why. We had no idea to the extent - it was such a surprise.'

She added: 'He had the best sense of humour ever. He was so sarcastic and 
would wind you up. He was caring, sensitive, thoughtful and creative.

'He was in a band. Music was a massive part of his life.'

Mr Robertshaw’s funeral was held on July 17 at Lytham Crematorium, with the popular musician receiving messages from fans as far away as London, Kent and Scandinavia.

His grandmother, Margaret Robertshaw, 68, said: 'It’s just so tragic that somebody so talented couldn’t get the help he needed.

His family - including his mother Cheryl and sister Suzanne are now calling for more help for those with mental health problems

'He didn’t want to admit to it because of the stigma of what people thought and it’s wrong.'

His family said he had planned to go to Japan next year and teach English to students.

A spokesman from Lancashire Police confirmed the body of a 21-year-old man was found on July 5.

He added the death was not being treated as suspicious and had been referred to the coroner’s office. An inquest has yet to be held.

Ms Dixon added: 'We are all going to have our regrets about not picking up on signs, but if you have friends or a young relative who is struggling - somehow try and get through to them.

'There should not be a stigma - years ago it used to be cancer, the ‘big c’. Now it is mental health and it should not be a stigma anymore'.
