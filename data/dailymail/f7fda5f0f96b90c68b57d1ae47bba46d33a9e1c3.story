Cat owners fear a killer is on the loose after six pets in the same street were killed with antifreeze in one week.

The RSPCA has launched an investigation over the string of poisonings in Albert Street, a quiet terrace in Padiham, Lancashire, with so many pets it is nicknamed 'cat street'.

Residents and the charity believe an assassin has used antifreeze deliberately in an act of spite - risking jail or a £20,000 fine.

The owners say they have heard mysterious 
noises in the dead of night and have found seedlings soaked in a 
luminous liquid, which they have passed to the RSPCA as evidence.

One resident, carer Emma Mayor, 34, had to take three-year-old male Gizmo to the vet after he appeared to be ‘drunk’ and was struggling to walk.

She and her daughter Cadie, 17, were told he had been poisoned and he was put down on June 21.

'Gizmo wasn’t just a cat, he was the love of my life,' she said. 'I got him when my mother died and he cheered me up and just became part of the family.

'He was my little boy. I’m devastated by what’s happened.

'The cases have been adding up and up. We knew there were six but we think there could be eight or nine now.'

Cadie added: 'People call this street "cat street" because there’s so many people that have cats.

'Someone must be doing it deliberately. Who would be using antifreeze in June?'

Another owner, Vivien Storey, 44, had to watch her 14-year-old long-haired tabby Diesel having a fit before dying last Thursday.

'I'm absolutely horrified and 
devastated,' she said. 'She was sitting there on the floor with black 
stuff coming out of her mouth. I couldn't watch'.

Used as an engine coolant, antifreeze is highly toxic to cats, which can be killed by drinking just a small amount.

It is far more dangerous than other poisons because cats are attracted to its sweet taste and symptoms can only begin hours after ingestion.

They react to its main ingredient ethylene glycol, which is also poisonous to humans and causes a host of symptons include the loss of muscle control, vomiting and seizures.

It would not by any means be the first deliberate poisoning attack on cats.

Previous cases have seen antifreeze used in acts of revenge against cats who prowl neighbours' gardens unwanted, or simply in sadistic killings.

Owners in Coventry, West Midlands, were horrified in January after nine of their cats died in a single week.

As well as investigating the events in Albert Street, the RSPCA is probing other recent cat deaths in the nearby towns of Nelson and Colne.

Inspector Charlotte Booker said: 'This is an extremely serious offence and offenders will face a jail sentence or a fine of up to £20,000 if and when we catch them.

'This is a horrendous act of cruelty against pets that are much-loved and it will not be tolerated.

'We also want to urge all cat owners in these areas to be vigilant and to look out for the symptoms of poisoning.

'Cats often look as though they are drunk and struggle to move around as normal.

'If anyone notices any of these symptoms, please get your cat to the vets straight away.

'Once cats have ingested antifreeze, they deteriorate quickly and will be dead in 24 hours if not treated immediately.'

Anyone with any information on the poisonings should call the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999.
