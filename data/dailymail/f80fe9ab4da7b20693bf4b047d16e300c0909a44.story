Perfectly balancing a pile of biscuits on top of his nose, Australian cattle dog Jack could teach circus performers a thing or two.

Showing perfect patience and poise, the three-year-old dog can balance a range of every day items on his face.

In a series of pictures posted on Reddit by his San Franciscan owners Nicole Lee and her boyfriend Trey, Jack is pictured balancing everything from a football to a frying pan on his head.

The talented animal, who was adopted by Nicole and Trey as a puppy, happily poses for the pictures in return for praise and treats.

The couple say they noticed the dog was particularly clever from a young age and began training him to balance items on his head while playing with him at home.

Biologist Nicole, 27, said: 'He is an Australian cattle dog and is probably mixed with something, but we don't know.

'From an early age we noticed he was very smart, so we taught him many tricks, this being one of them.

Well trained: Jack was taught how to balance a range of items after his owners spotted that he was intelligent from a young age

'He learned how to play fetch when he was 8 weeks old.

'The balancing act started when we tried balancing a kernel of popcorn on his nose one night while watching a movie at home.

'We quickly learned he was patient enough to allow us to stack really anything on his head, as long as it's not too heavy.

Perfectly poised: The San Francisco couple have now started to teach Jack more elaborate tricks

'We train him by positively reinforcing good behaviours and ignoring the "wrong" ones; basically just a lot of cheering him on.

'He responds really well to praise, so we use that as a reward as well as the ball.'

Nicole and Trey say that they've continued to try and teach their dog more elaborate tricks.

The latest stunt was teaching the dog to close all the kitchen cupboards and open the fridge door by himself.
