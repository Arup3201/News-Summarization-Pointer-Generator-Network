You tap your cigarette, rearrange the flowers and head to the kitchen to make dinner.

These everyday actions, using ordinary objects, are so common in our lives that our brains skim over the smallest details.

But what if you held a microscope up to the unseen world? What kind of perspective would we get on common objects around us?

FEI's instrument owners were invited to submit their best images for inclusion in National Geographic promotional materials for its giant screen film 'Invisible Worlds'.  This view of a cigarette filter, revealing cellulose acetate fibers, was the May winner in the 'Around the House' category

That's exactly what an annual image contest organised by FEI, an Oregon-based imaging company, alongside National Geographic, aims to find out. 

These images, taken as part of a competition to capture the unseen world, aim to shift our perspective of common objects by placing them under a new light. 

FEI’s instrument owners were invited to submit their best images for inclusion in National Geographic promotional materials for its giant screen film ‘Invisible Worlds’.

Marcos Rosado was awarded first place for this image of an Acacia Dealbata flower. Mr Rosado said he picked the bloom from a tree in his parents' garden

The mouth parts of the aquatic third-stage larva of an Asian tiger mosquito are seen at 800 x magnification. The mosquito can carry dengue and chikungunya viruses, both of which cause high fevers. The infections usually occur in tropical regions of Africa, Asia and South America. The image was taken by Riccardo Antonelli

Barcelona-based Marcos Rosado, an electron microscopy specialist, was awarded first place in the 2013 FEI Image Contest for his entry ‘Acacia Dealbata Flower’. 

‘I was in the garden of my parents' house admiring the Acacia Dealbata,’ recalled Mr Rosado.

‘I noticed a little ball hanging from a branch of the tree which was going to be a flower in a few days. 

‘It seemed to have some beautiful yellow spots into it, so I decided to take it and have a look at it in the microscope.

‘What I discovered is that it, as I supposed, was an Acacia Dealbata flower about to open. It was really beautiful.’

Categories for this year's image contest were designed to be more consumer friendly and included 'The Natural World', 'The Human Body', and 'Around the House'. This image of dendritic cells (immune cells) stimulated with silicon microparticles was the July winner in 'The Human Body' category

This extreme close-up image of a Helichrysum italicum flower with pollen grains was the June winner in the 'Natural World' category. Helichrysum iltalicum is also known as the curry plant, because of the strong smell of its leaves and grows on dry, rocky or sandy ground around the Mediterranean

This photo of bacterial nanocables that were found in Denmark's Aarhus Bay was the July winner in the 'Natural World' category. Bacterial nano cables are electrically conductive systems produced by a number of bacteria

A view of a cigarette filter, revealing cellulose acetate fibers, is shown as the May winner in the 'Around the House' category.

Green-tinted false arms, also known as pseudopods, are shown from a human fibroblast cell over silica microparticles in this photo. A pseudopod is a temporary projection seen in some cells, including amoebas and white blood cells. Its function is to help the cell move

This photo reveals the fracture surface of a snap-off blade after breaking off one of the segments

This photo shows silicon nanowires that were grown on copper foil with gold on top, through a process known as chemical vapor deposition. These nanowires will be used to manufacture anodes for lithium-ion batteries

One entry imaged incredibly detailed green-tinted false arms, also known as pseudopods, shown from a human fibroblast cell over silica microparticles.

Cyril Geudj meanwhile used an FEI Strata scanning transmission electron microscope to create an incredible image simply titled 'The Web'.

This image is an extremely high magnification image of a grid he uses to grow samples for observation.

Winners of FEI’s ‘Explore the Unseen’ 
image contest in partnership with National Geographic’s ‘Mysteries of 
the Unseen World,’ debuts November 8 2013.

This photo of Torilis arvensis, more commonly known as spreading hedge parsley, was the July winner in the 'Other Relevant Science' category
