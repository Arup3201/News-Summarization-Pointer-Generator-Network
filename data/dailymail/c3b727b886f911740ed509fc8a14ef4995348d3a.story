He recently revealed that he calls Kris Jenner 'Mom,' and refers to Rob Kardashian as his, 'little brother'.

It seems that over the years rapper and designer Kanye West has truly become one of the Kardashians.

This  was made clear when Kris and Kendall were spotted front row at his fashion show in New York last week, signalling how close he really is to  the reality television family.

He even had Kim's younger sister Kylie Jenner play a starring role in the presentation, her biggest modelling gig to date.  

But despite the fact that he has regularly been criticised for his relationship with Kim and her siblings his ingratiation into the clan has been no mistake. 

Indeed, Kanye has never hidden how even before he and Kim got together he long desired to be part of not only her life, but part of her family's. 

In an interview with Kris Jenner in 2013 she revealed how the rapper would draw himself into the annual Kardashian Christmas card before he and Kim started dating in 2012.

She said: 'He would take the photo when he saw it online and would Photoshop himself into the card and then share it with Kim.'

The matriarch of the family then revealed one of Kanye's altered images with him drawn in on paint in the background.

He also said of his now wife: 'There's times when I wasn't with [Kim], I wanted be with her so bad I thought about taking up sports,' joking about the fact that she used to only date sports players.

Kanye even made a much-hyped appearance on Kourtney and Kim Take New York in 2011, hopelessly flirting with Kim and making efforts to befriend her sister.

And when they finally made things official last year, tying the knot in a lavish Italian ceremony he praised the family in his wedding speech, calling them, 'an industry.'

He and Kim have spent nearly two years living at Kris' house in California along with her sisters Kendall and Kylie while their home was renovated.

Kanye said of the experience: 'When I'm out, I just want to get home early so I can be with my family,' although he did note that the house was particularly, 'noisy.'

Kris herself admitted, 'We love each other a whole bunch.'

Tragedy struck in 2007 when Kanye lost his mother, Donda West, after she had complications during surgery

Kanye's desire to ingratiate himself into the Kardashian clan may also have something to do with the fact that his own family life has been marred with tragedy.

In 2007 the rapper was left bereft and heartbroken at the loss of his mother Donda West who died aged just 58 due to complications during surgery. 

Kanye has since spoken of his deep depression following her passing.

He's also spoken of his deep regret that Donda never got to meet his 19-month old daughter North.

'There's been some ups and downs. I made some mistakes and I've made some accomplishments. There's only one thing I regret,' he admitted.

'There's only one thing I wish I could change out of everything that's ever happened.'

Kanye says he is happy now that he has wife Kim and his daughter North in his life

He said on Kris Jenner's show: 'After I lost my mother, there was times I felt like, I would put my life at risk. I felt like sometimes I didn't have something to live for. Now I have two really special people to live for.'

In his most recent interview Kanye let slip that he calls Kris Mom when talking about making his way into the fashion world and being rejected because of his Kardashian connections.

He said: 'Soon as we started dating, fashion people were really opposed to the idea of reality stars. And all the relationships, the somewhat friends that I had somewhat built up, completely turned their backs on her and me.'
