Horror films and TV shows are about to get a lot more scary.

Philips and SyFy have unveiled the first TV show that syncs with smart lights to control them.

12 Monkeys, a drama based on the 1995 film starring Bruce Willis (which itself was based on a 1962 short film called La Jetée), will come complete with a light track to marry the on screen action with your lights.

 'We constantly look for new and innovative ways to create the optimal environment in the home through unique lighting experiences, from everyday tasks to deeper engagement with your favorite TV shows such as 12 Monkeys,' said Amy Huntington, president, Philips Lighting - Americas.

When combined, the app will detect audio cues from 12 Monkeys and translate them to the Web-enabled Hue system. 

'Fans will then be enveloped in the onscreen action through ambient lighting effects designed to engage viewers in an entirely unique way,' the firm promises. 

The experience follows the success of this summer's Sharknado 2, which, for the first time ever, enabled home viewers to sync their Philips Hue lighting system to accompany the soundtrack.

 'Working with Syfy on Sharknado 2, we gave viewers a whole new way to experience television and with 12 Monkeys our partnership pushes the envelope from a movie to the first television series with integrated light tracks,' said Huntington.

With 12 Monkeys, audiences will get custom light tracks for a full 13 episodes.

Matthew Chiavelli of SyFy said: 'We are consistently at the forefront of utilizing technology for transmedia storytelling.

With Sharknado 2, our fan base whole-heartedly embraced the addition of Philips Hue to their viewing experience. 

'The gritty drama that 12 Monkeys delivers offers a perfect opportunity for us to extend this exceptional capability throughout the entire first season'

The TV show is based on the 1995 American science fiction film directed by Terry Gilliam.

It, in turn, inspired by Chris Marker's 1962 short film La Jetée, and starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt, with Christopher Plummer and David Morse in supporting roles. 

The original short, constructed almost entirely from still photos, it tells the story of an experiment in time travel. 

It is 28 mins long, black and white.

The Philips hue system is the market-leader in smart lighting for the home. 

This starter kit comprises three bulbs and a unit called a ‘bridge’, that connects your lights to your wifi system, allowing you to control the lights with your iOS or Android smartphone or tablet.

If you want to really go to town, you can add up to 50 more bulbs. 

As well as being able to control the lights, you can also make the lights respond in certain ways to certain events.

For example, if your football team scores, the lights could be programmed to flash. 

Or if you get an email from your children, the lights could change colour. 

The lights can also double as an alarm, and even automatically turn on when you return home. 

The hue lightbulbs can recreate any colour
