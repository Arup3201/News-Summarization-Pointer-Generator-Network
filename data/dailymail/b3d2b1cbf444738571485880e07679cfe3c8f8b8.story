Fitness trackers typically monitor people as they move around and exercise, but many of us spend hours at a time sat at our desks, leaving these trackers a little redundant.

But now, a designer has created the world's first 'inactivity tracker' - a smart cushion that monitors a user’s heart beat, breathing rate and posture, through their bottom.

Called Darma, the device identifies when people are slouching, or if their stress levels are too high, and provides tips to correct it using an app.

The Darma cushion, (pictured) uses sensors to monitor a user’s vital signs, including their posture, heart beat and respiratory rate. The smart cushion identifies if a user is slouching, and an app offers tips to correct their posture. Darma is due to launch in June and will cost $199 (£122)

Size: 15.7" x 15.7"x 1.2" (40cm x 40cm x 3cm)

Padding: Multi-layer memory foam

Battery: Lithium-ion battery last for one month on a single charge

Connectivity: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

Charging: USB mini port

Apps: Free on iOS and Android 

Price: $199 (£122) plus $25 (£15) shipping

Expected delivery date: June 2015 

The name was inspired by Bodhidharma, the person attributed as the 'father' of Zen and meditation by the California-based firm.

After collecting a user's vital signs, the free Darma app recommends certain activities based on what it detects.

For example, if a user has been sitting down for too long, the app warns them, and offers stretches they can do to limber up.

When slouching, the app helps users, in real time, change their position by guiding them using on-screen prompts.

When high stress levels are detected, Darma tells the user to take a break, or offers a guided meditation plan.

These levels can also be tracked over a period of time, to identify key moments of stress and find ways to resolve them.

Darma connects to a smartphone using Bluetooth, and its lithium-ion battery is said to last for one month on a single charge. 

The 1mm sensors inside the cushion have been developed to detect even the tiniest of body movements.

They were designed by California-based Dr. Junhao Hu.

Dr Hu has created a prototype and has already received $124,000 (£76,700) to fund production of the device, through a Kickstarter campaign.

The campaign ends on 14 November and models of the cushion are expected to ship in June, for $199 (£122).

People who pre-order the cushion from the Kickstarter campaign, however, can get a model for $99 (£61). International shipping adds $25 (£15) to this price.

‘Darma is the world's first "inactivity tracker" - a non-invasive smart cushion to monitor your sitting habits and improve your physical and mental health,’ explained the firm on its Kickstarter page.

‘Darma uses novel sensor technology and algorithms to offer actionable guidance to improve posture, balance sitting time and reduce stress.

‘[Its] sensors are accurate enough to even detect and monitor your vitals including heart rate, heartbeat waveform, respiratory rate, and breathing waveform.'
