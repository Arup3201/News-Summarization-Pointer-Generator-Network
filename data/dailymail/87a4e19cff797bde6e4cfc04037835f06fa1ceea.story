A surfer, who was attacked by two great white sharks as he attempted to catch a wave, has revealed the incredible survival story in which he lost both of his arms.

Sean Pollard was surfing at a remote beach near Esperance in Western Australia in October last year when he felt what he described as a 'massive bump'.

After first taking a bite out of his board and then taking a second chunk out of his leg, the shark went for his arms.

'I was trying to paddle calmly so I wasn't splashing around like I was panicking, but once it got directly behind me it charged through the water. That's when it really went in for the for the kill,' Mr Pollard told Channel Nine's 60 Minutes.

Sean Pollard lost both his arms when he was attacked by two great white sharks while surfing in WA in October 

After feeling what he described as a 'massive bump', the shark took one bite out of his board and a second out of his leg 

'I spun around to try and face it. It just moved so quick. That's when it come up out of the water, I didn't even see its teeth. It took me like across, and its eye was right there in front of me.

'Its eye was the blackest black I'd ever seen, and that's just a vision that's burnt into my mind. I can't get it out, just this cover going over its eye as it bit down on me.'

'It started shaking its head. Both my arms were in its mouth and it just took me underwater. I remember having to hold my breath and just shook its head, like seven or eight times …it's just the hardest thing I've ever felt. It was so strong.

'Its eye was the blackest black I'd ever seen, and that's just a vision that's like burnt into my mind. I can't get it out, just this cover going over its eye as it as it bit down on me,' he said

'…and then next thing I popped up and … there was just blood everywhere. It had ripped my forearm off and like sucked the meat off my bone, like a chicken bone pretty much'

But Mr Pollard's nightmare didn't end there. After losing one arm, he felt the 'second bump' - another great white

The double attack is the first of its kind in the world to ever to be reported.

Despite being attacked at least 50 metres from the shore and losing a huge amount of blood, Mr Pollard miraculously managed to kick his way back to the beach.

'I find myself grieving for my old life every now and then and what everything I aspired to be before, it's all kind of changed now. It's pretty hard some days,' Mr Pollard said

The brave man had to travel over 700km from the remote beach to a hospital where he received emergency surgery.

'I find myself grieving for my old life every now and then and what everything I aspired to be before, it's all kind of changed now. It's pretty hard some days,' Mr Pollard said.

'Some mornings you just don't want to get out of bed and face it, but then again some days when you're doing something nice I think, you know, it's pretty good that I'm still here to be able to enjoy this.'
