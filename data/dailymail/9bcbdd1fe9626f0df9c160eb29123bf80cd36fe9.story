A confidential call between the FBI and Scotland Yard was recorded by hacking group Anonymous - the very people they were trying to catch, it was revealed today.

The group released a 15-minute tape of what appears to be a conference call last month about tracking and prosecuting the group’s members.

The top-secret conversation begins with a bizarre exchange between the U.S. and British agents, where they talk about cheese and eating 'McDonald's at the Pentagon'.

It is not known whether cheese and McDonald's are codenames or if the transcript simply reveals what is really at the top of the list of priorities of our law enforcement officers.

There is also one point when 'Bruce', 
the U.S. agent, says to the British agent 'Stuart': 'I'm not sure if 
we're the only two on right now or not'.

Anonymous also published a top secret 
email apparently sent by an FBI agent, which gave details and a password
 for accessing the call.

The cyber raid is the most audacious and 
sinister yet to be carried out by the shadowy hacking group and shows 
how powerful Anonymous has become.

And in a display of their growing reach, 
Anonymous also claimed credit for hacking the websites of the police 
forces in Boston, Massachusetts, and Salt Lake City, Utah.

This came hours after they attacked the Greek Ministry
 of Justice site. ‘The FBI might be curious how we're 
able to continuously read their internal comms for some time now,’ the 
group tweeted.

cases of Ryan Cleary, left, and Jake Davis, right - two British suspects
 linked to Anonymous

The recording, which has since been 
verified by the FBI, appears to have been edited to bleep out the names 
of some suspects being discussed.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation 
said the information ‘was intended for law enforcement officers only and
 was illegally obtained.’

'A criminal investigation is under way to identify and hold accountable those responsible'

‘A criminal investigation is under way to identify and hold accountable those responsible,’ the law-enforcement bureau added.

'We are aware of the video, which 
relates to an FBI conference call involving a PCeU (Police Central 
e-crime Unit) representative,' London's Metropolitan Police said on 
Friday.

'The matter is being investigated by 
the FBI. At this stage no operational risks to the MPS have been 
identified - however, we continue to carry out a full assessment.'

Amid the material published by 
Anonymous was a message purportedly sent by an FBI agent to 
international law enforcement agencies.

It invites his foreign counterparts to
 join the call to ‘discuss the on-going investigations related to 
Anonymous and other associated splinter groups’.

Boast: The group gloated on Twitter as they released a recording of what appears to be a conference call last month about prosecuting their members

The email to officials in the UK, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and France had a phone number and 
password for accessing the call.

But only American and British 
officials can be heard on the recording. Neither the FBI agent nor 
others coded in on the call have commented.

The conference call dial-in details were
 reportedly sent in an email to officials and someone forwarded it to a 
private, non-government email account which was compromised at some 
point.

'If they haven't secured their email it could potentially prejudice the investigation'

Karen Todner, lawyer for Ryan Cleary, linked with Anonymous

The email released by the hackers that appears to be the one the FBI sent out to organise the teleconference asked all participants to use a single code to gain entry to the call.

The call would have been more secure if attendees had each been assigned unique access codes and been required to identify themselves by name upon dialling in, law enforcement sources said.

If a hacker had dialled in with a unique access code and made it past initial screening, the organisers may have identified a breach when it became clear two parties were using the same dial-in.

Those on the call talk about what 
legal strategy to pursue in the cases of Ryan Cleary and Jake Davis - 
two British suspects linked to Anonymous.

They also discuss evidence against 
other suspects. Karen Todner, a lawyer for Cleary, said the recording 
could be ‘incredibly sensitive’.

She warned the breach could derail 
police work. ‘If they haven't secured their email it could potentially 
prejudice the investigation,’ she said.

Anonymous is an amorphous collection 
of online enthusiasts, pranksters and activists whose targets have 
included the Church of Scientology.

They have also run attacks against the music industry, and financial companies such as Visa and MasterCard.

Following a spate of arrests globally,
 the group and its various offshoots have focused their attention on law
 enforcement, especially the FBI.

Data security expert Graham Cluley 
said hackers were able to eavesdrop on the call because they had 
compromised an investigator's emails.

‘The very people that (police) are 
trying to apprehend, could have been tuning in to their internal 
conversations,’ he wrote in a blog post.

Meanwhile, a message posted on the 
Boston police website on Friday said: 'Anonymous hacks Boston Police 
website in retaliation for police brutality at OWS (Occupy Wall 
Street)'.

Anonymous today launched a cyber-attack on the Greek Ministry of Justice website, and warned of plans to target a further 300 ministry and media sites.

The hack was apparently a protest against the Greek government's signing of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which is designed to reduce internet piracy.

The group has unleashed havoc on several European governments during the past month.

Boston's Occupy movement set up camp in the city's financial district for two months last autumn, but police dismantled it in December, citing public health and safety concerns.

The hackers in Utah gained access to sensitive
data, including citizen complaints about drug crimes, phone numbers,
addresses and other personal information, police said.

‘We're still knee deep in trying to get a feel for the
extent of the problem,’ Salt Lake City police Detective Dennis McGowan said on
Friday afternoon.

'A law enforcement agency using unencrypted, unsecure communications is a major fumble,' said Marcus Carey, who spent years securing communications for the U.S. National Security Agency.

‘What if this event was talking about some terrorist plot to blow up something and “they” were listening in? It could've been much worse if it was related to an Al Qaeda plot or something.’

A preliminary conversation is heard between British and U.S. law enforcement agencies before they discuss the operations against Anonymous:

'Please enter your passcode followed by the # key or *0 to speak with an operator. Your passcode has been confirmed. Please wait while you are joined to the conference'

'Hello?''Hey Stuart? Hey, it's Bruce''Hello Bruce, how're you doing?''Alright. I'm not sure if we're the only two on right now or not''Bruce, don't say anything too bad - I'm here with Matt''Do you wanna talk about cheese?''Cheese? What about that McDonald's at the Pentagon eh? I've told so many people. No-one believes me'

Then the British law enforcement agent 'Stuart' speaks about their investigations:

Anonymous is a notorious group of hackers around the world who have no central authority.

Masked: Anonymous has hit the headlines in the past for shutting down websites

The group was in the news last month for briefly shutting down the FBI and Justice Department websites in the U.S. after popular file-sharing website Megaupload was closed down.

They work by agreeing on targets in internet chat rooms and then attacking at the same time. One of their most famous targets that generated much publicity was the Church of Scientology in 2008.

Anonymous also attacked the Amazon, Visa, MasterCard and PayPal websites in 2010 after the companies decided to stop working with Julian Assange’s controversial website WikiLeaks.

They have also attacked the websites of the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America for tightly controlling copyright, reported Agence France-Presse.

Last autumn one hacker affiliated with Anonymous was arrested for allegedly targeting Sony's PlayStation Network, Qriocity music streaming and Sony Online Entertainment.
