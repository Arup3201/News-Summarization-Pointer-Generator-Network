The internet is awash with dogs, cats and even rats all vying to capture our hearts and become stars.

But one pampered Pomeranian has turned pro, and is raking in £6,000-a-year after becoming a social media sensation, with thousands of Facebook and Twitter followers.

Glamorous pooch Harvey Moon was rescued from kennels as a puppy by Stephanie Mariam, who has since spent £15,000 on turning her pet into a well-groomed superstar.

Pomeranian Harvey Moon has £800 a month spent on him. His outfits cost £140 a month and his 'Pawdicures' cost £60. He receives gifts from fans worth hundreds of pounds 

Harvey, who was rescued as a puppy, now has thousands of followers on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter

The mental health nurse and dance teacher ploughs £800 a month - more than half her earnings - into keeping him pristine for his profile pictures.

He has his own wardrobe, enjoys £40 hair extensions every month and regularly changes his colour thanks to £200 fur dyes imported from America.

Harvey now has a dedicated following of 8,000 Facebook fans and 500 Instagram and Twitter followers who lavish the pooch with gifts.

And Stephanie's investment has definitely paid off as Harvey now makes £6,000-a-year in personal appearance and sponsorship fees.

Four-year-old Harvey even has his own bank account, agent, stylist and personal assistant.  appearances.

Stephanie, 21, said: 'Making Harvey famous might have cost a lot of money, but it doesn't seem that much from week to week.

'It's worth it - he loves the attention.'

She continued: 'Social media means that Harvey can achieve his dream of being a worldwide icon. He's definitely a diva, and Facebook is the perfect place for him to show off.'

Stephanie rescued Harvey in 2011 when he was just six months old - he had been badly neglected by previous owners.

After taking him home in Bournemouth, Stephanie started buying  bespoke dog jackets to keep him cosy.

She said: 'Harvey loved the attention. He began to trot over to the wardrobe and pull out his favourite outfits for me to dress him up.'

Loving how cute the Pomeranian looked in photos, Stephanie created a Facebook page in Harvey's name in April 2012.

As Harvey racked up followers, Stephanie created an Instagram and Twitter account to boost his celebrity status further.

She started to splash more cash to make his profile stand out from other cute pets.

Harvey has rocked a range of styles and colours in his fur, from bright green to neon pink

In April 2013, Stephanie began spending £200 a month importing vegetable-based doggie dyes from America to keep Harvey's look fresh. 

He has since rocked a range of styles and colours, from bright green to neon pink.

And flat fur won't do for this high-maintenance hound either - Stephanie channels £40 a month into luxury feather fur extensions to keep Harvey's coat voluminous and make his pictures stand out.

In 2013, Stephanie received a call from an agent who had seen Harvey's profile and loved his glamorous look.

The agent got Harvey a gig as an extra in the music video for urban grime act Roll Deep's 'All or Nothing' - netting an impressive £700 for his bank account.

Stephanie said: 'After he appeared in the music video, Harvey's fan base grew even more.

'Facebook followers would comment on my posts and pictures of Harvey all the time and they even started to send him presents.'

Harvey started to receive gifts posted from fans from as far away as Amsterdam, Egypt and Asia.

Among the most lavish bestowed upon the pooch was a Louis Vuitton top worth £200 and a Swarovski-encrusted collar worth £300.

Sensing the power of Facebook publicity, Stephanie began using the social media site to promote the pooch's public appearances.

She said: 'People wanted to see Harvey so much that if I posted that we were going to be somewhere, fans turn up wanting to be photographed with him and upload the pics on their own social media.'

As Harvey's public popularity grew, so did the amount of money Stephanie channelled into pampering the high-maintenance pup.

She said: 'I want him to become an international icon, so I knew I had to put the time and money into making it happen.'

To keep Harvey's fur in A-list condition for his profile pictures, she began ploughing £75 a week into Harvey's grooming regime.

This includes a wash and blow dry to keep his coat glossy from nose to tail, 'pawdicures' and treatments to buffer the pads of his feet and facials.

Stephanie also started to spend £140 a month on new outfits for Harvey so he can boast the latest in doggie designer gear in his Facebook snaps.

She said: 'I have two wardrobes in my room and three-quarters of the space is taken up with Harvey's outfits.

'He wears every outfit at least once. He will parade around in it and I'll snap a picture to upload it to Facebook so his fans know he appreciates the pressies.'

His unique profile - which features pictures of the Pomeranian perched on a throne, wearing crystal-encrusted outfits and sporting neon-coloured fur - captured the attention of dog modelling agency Diva Dogs.

The agency approached Stephanie and offered to represent him last September.

Later that month, Harvey became the animated face of Dennis Holmes Energy Saving company.

With his army of Facebook fans tipping the 8,000 mark, Stephanie invested even more in boosting her pup's profile.

And if the celebrity pressure becomes too much for Harvey Moon, he can sleep it off comfortably - in one of the three mini-four poster beds Stephanie has bought for him, at a cost of £700.

Stephanie says: 'Harvey's Facebook fame is going to his head. Now, he sits on the ground and refuses to go outside if it's raining. He thinks it will mess up his fur.

'I've also had to buy special coats that are designed with cooling pads to stop him getting flustered in the summer - they're £60 each.'
