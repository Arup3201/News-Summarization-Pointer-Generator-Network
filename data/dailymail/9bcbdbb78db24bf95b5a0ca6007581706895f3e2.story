Confession: Joel Jones, 47, turned himself into police Tuesday night after brutally raping a woman he lured on Facebook

A sex offender turned himself into police Tuesday night after brutally raping a woman he met on Craigslist through a fake ad looking for an office cleaner in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

Joel Jones, 47, called 911 immediately after the attack and was waiting for Palm beach County Sheriff's deputies when they arrived outside the office building.

'I assaulted her,' he yelled. 'Take me to jail.'

Jones went on to tell detectives that he lured the woman to the office building with an ad on Craigslist, asking for a cleaning person.

The two first met at a gas station close to the building, and then the woman followed Jones in his car to the office building near 21300 Alternative A1a.

Once inside, Jones gave the woman a tour, showing her all of the room she would be cleaning and when they came to the last room he made a pass at her, the victim told police according to the report.

She refused him and tried to leave the room, but he then grabbed her arm and removed her pants.

The woman tried to fight but Jones threatened her with a silver 'flip-style knife' - holding it against her neck.

He then threw her to the floor and raped her.

When Jones let the woman go, he immediately called 911. The woman says she saw him making the call as she was escaping.

Jones told police he should be sent to prison because he 'tricked' the woman and 'brutally raped her' and that the crime was premeditated.

According to the Florida Department of Corrections, Jones has been to prison two times before - once for two years in 1991 for sexual battery and burglary and once for eight years for second-degree murder.
