These fascinating images show just a fraction of one the largest collection of preserved zoological specimens in the world.

A shark and myriad other creatures lie preserved in alcohol in the East Wing of the Natural History Museum in Berlin, Germany.

The East Wing houses a three-storey steel and glass structure in which 276,000 glass cylinders containing 81,880 litres of alcohol line more than seven miles of shelves containing over one million fish, reptiles, mammals, spiders, worms, crabs, insects and invertebrae.

It is the first time many of them, some of which date back to the 18th century, have been seen by the general public.

The original East Wing was destroyed by Allied bombing during the Second World War, when a bomb crashed into the 'Anatomical Hall' exhibition on the ground floor, tearing away the pillar of the east wing of the museum and sending the specimens collapsing into the basement.

In 1995, museum staff decided to modernise and overhaul the museum, including the reconstruction of the East Wing, which was completed in 2010.

Loss: Much of the collection was damaged or destroyed by an allied bomb in the Second World War

The Museum of Natural History now has 
probably the world's most modern zoological collection building for 
natural history collections in alcohol, also known as 'wet collections'.

'These are valuable, irreplaceable cultural assets that have been collected over two centuries and remain indispensable for biological research to this day, and are extensively used internationally,' the museum said in a statement.

'It is a milestone for the preservation of our collections and provides optimal conditions for research into biodiversity and evolution.'

Pickled: The jars contain a staggering 81,880 litres of alcohol. The 
samples are spread out over three levels, allowing members of the public
 to see many for the first time

Preserved: The new wing was completed in 2010

Because of the damage the museum sustained during the bombing, many specimens are in a poor condition, often with information missing which has to be painstakingly researched.

'For me the biggest gift is that only 
six jars broke during the move,' Peter Bartsch, the curator of the 
collection, told Bild newspaper.

The museum also hosts many expertly reconstructed dinosaur skeletons, including the worldâ€™s biggest dinosaur skeleton, a Brachiosaurus, which stands over 13 metres tall.
