A striking image that allegedly shows a mushroom cloud rising on Mars has been pounced on by conspiracy theorists.

Alien forums say the image is 'evidence' that a civilisation may have been wiped off the Martian surface as a result of nuclear war.

The satellite image shows a zoomed in section of Valles Marineris, a 2,500-mile (4,000km) long canyon on Mars, which was captured by the Indian Space Research Organisation.

A striking image that allegedly shows a mushroom cloud (circled red) rising on Mars has been pounced on by conspiracy theorists. Alien forums say the image is 'evidence' that a civilisation may have been wiped off the Martian surface as a result of nuclear war

French Youtube channel UFOvni Disclosure has created a short film showing the 'cloud of smoke' which it claims could be either a nuclear explosion or extra-terrestrial methane.

'India's Mars orbiter captured something strange in the gigantic Valles Marineris Canyon of Mars,' the video says.

'The image shows a huge mushroom cloud and we may wonder whether it is an enormous rare dust wind cloud, or caused due to a nuclear or methane explosion.'

The image was taken around the same time as the Siding Spring comet passed Mars last year.

'At the moment of the close passage of (the comet) to the planet Nasa cut off the live feed,' said UFOvni Disclosure.

'But Dr Fritz Helmut Hemmerich was able to make a video from 1,200 metres at Tenerife in the Canary Islands showing (the comet) immediately after its Mars encounter and a huge explosion.'

Dr Jonti Horner, astronomer at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia, told the Express: 'Fun as it would be to imagine that this is evidence of nuclear weapons on Mars...that's sadly just not the case.'

He said looking images of the 'cloud' were an optical illusion caused by the angle of the crater with the trench.

The theory that an ancient civilisation on Mars was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race is popular among conspiracy theorists.

Last year, plasma physicist Dr John Brandenburg said he believed ancient Martians known as Cydonians and Utopians were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today.

Back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on Mars could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion.

A scientist is to present his theory that ancient life on Mars was massacred. Dr Brandenburg is giving a talk on his research tomorrow in Illinois at the American Physical Society. He says there is evidence for two nuclear explosions on Mars (image from his paper shown)

'The Martian surface is covered with a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium, thorium and radioactive potassium - and this pattern radiates from a hot spot on Mars,' he told Fox News at the time.

'A nuclear explosion could have sent debris all around the planet.'

But since then he has advanced his theory to the level that he now no longer thinks it was a naturally occurring explosion - but rather one planned by an intelligent alien race.

According to Vice, the conclusion of his latest paper says that nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere resembling hydrogen bomb tests 'may present an example of civilisation wiped out by a nuclear attack from space.'

His research centres around the 'high concentration' of Xenon-129 in the Martian atmosphere, and uranium and thorium on the surface, spotted by Nasa's Mars Odyssey spacecraft.

Dr Brandenburg says evidence for the explosions exists near two sites that apparently had life in the past, including Cydonia, the location of the famous 'face on Mars' spotted from orbit (left). However, later images showed it was just a chance alignment of shifting dust dunes (right)

Aside from this outlandish theory, Dr John Brandenburg has led a rather more normal, and prestigious, career.

He has a PhD in Theoretical Plasma Physics from the University of California at Davis.

Currently he works as a plasma physicist at Orbital Technologies in Madison Wisconsin.

He has worked on a variety of propulsion technologies and previously was an independent consultant on Space Missile Defense and Directed Energy Weapons.

Dr Brandenburg has authored a number of books with his latest, Death on Mars: The Discovery of a Planetary Nuclear Massacre, to be published in February 2015. 

Scientists have previously pointed about that the appearance of these elements is not surprising, as they are natural elements found everywhere.

But Dr Brandenburg is adamant they are the remnants of two nuclear explosions on the surface.

He will lay out his research tomorrow in his talk titled 'Evidence of Massive Thermonuclear Explosions in Mars Past, The Cydonian Hypothesis, and Fermi's Paradox'.

And he is also apparently set to have a paper published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics.

He says Mars once had an Earth-like climate home to animal and plant life, and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient Egyptians on Earth.

Back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on Mars (pictured) could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion - but now he thinks it was caused by an intelligent alien race

This is based on his analysis of two regions, one being Cydonia, where the infamous - and later discredited - 'face on Mars' was found.

This, according to Dr Brandenburg, is an artefact from the ancient alien race.

Here, one of the supposed nuclear explosions wiped out the civilisation at Cydonia Mensa and another, smaller one destroyed a civilisation at a region called Galaxias Chaos.

'Analysis of new images from Odyssey, MRO and Mars Express orbiters now show strong evidence of eroded archeological objects at these sites,' he writes in the abstract for his research to be presented tomorrow.

'Taken together, the data requires that the hypothesis of Mars as the site of an ancient planetary nuclear massacre, must now be considered.'

Dr Brandenburg says his theory could explain the Fermi Paradox - namely why, if the universe is abundant with life, we haven't heard anything from anyone else yet.
