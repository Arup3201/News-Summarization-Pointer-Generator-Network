When Hollywood creates villains, they are usually gangsters or psychopaths – or a combination of the two.

The baddies in a new film starring Dame Judi Dench are nuns – and the real life order of sisters portrayed in the box office hit are furious.

The critically-acclaimed release Philomena has been accused of distorting the truth in its depiction of an order of Irish sisters as ‘uncaring and heartless’.

They say they are made to look like ‘villains’ in the film, which tells the real life story of Philomena Lee and her attempts to find her adopted son.

Nuns inform Philomena, played by Dame Judi, that she should be punished for becoming pregnant as a teenager – and then obstruct her attempts to find her son, burn records and are paid to put children up for adoption.

The film is based on the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by journalist and former New Labour spin doctor Martin Sixsmith, played on screen by Steve Coogan.

In the story, the young woman is sent to a home for unmarried mothers run by Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in County Tipperary and her son is put up for adoption in America.

But Sister Julie Rose, the order’s assistant congregational leader, said the film ‘does not tell the whole truth, and in many ways is very misleading’. The order were denied a copy of the script and failed in attempts to delay the film’s release so they could respond, she told The Tablet magazine.

They were also informed that one scene – in which Sister Hildegarde McNulty accuses Philomena of giving in to her ‘carnal desires’ – was being added.

Sister Julie said: ‘The film company confirmed to us in writing at an early stage of production that a second meeting with Sister Hildegarde would be incorporated into the film and dramatic licence was the reason given to us.’ She said Sister Hildegarde, who died in 1995, had in fact been instrumental in reuniting many mothers with their children.

Sister Julie also denied the order destroyed any records and said they never received any payment in relation to adoption. The film, which was released last Friday, took £1.51 million at the UK box office in its opening weekend.

A spokesman for film-maker Pathe said although some scenarios were changed for ‘dramatic purposes’, the story was ‘materially true’. He said the nuns were contacted twice over the screenplay last year but they failed to send a formal reply.

‘As the nuns have themselves acknowledged, the film is not a documentary,’ he said. ‘If the congregations have seen the film, they will know that it is not a diatribe against the Catholic Church but it does challenge the Church’s instinct to conceal the original wrong and to refuse to apologise.’
