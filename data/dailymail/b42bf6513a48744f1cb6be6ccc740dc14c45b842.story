An 18-year-old freshman with a history of mental health problems plunged to her death last night from the 14th-floor window of a Columbia University dormitory.

Martha Corey-Ochoa, a former high school valedictorian from Dobbs Ferry, New York, fell from the university residence John Jay Hall in an apparent suicide, police said.

She died at nearby St Luke’s Hospital after falling from the dorm window at 11pm on the day most freshmen at the New York residence moved in.

Columbia student Martha Corey-Ochoa, 18, fell to her death from a dorm window late Monday night

'Everyone was out here seconds after it happened,' said witness Efraim Ramos, 54. 'Everyone was in the street, it was packed.'

Two freshmen were the first to find the woman lying in the road and were said to be in shock after the discovery, the New York Post reported.

She lived on the 14th floor of the building in a single room, police told DNAinfo.com.

The gifted student claimed she enjoyed reading 'Twlight' and Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment and she listed English literature and calculus as some of her interests.

'People were getting ready to go to a party but then I found out the building was sealed off and nobody was being allowed out or in,' said fellow John Jay Hall resident 19-year-old Lucas Zeppetello.

'I was in my room and nobody bothered me. I didn't even poke my head out.'

She left no note and there were no witnesses, according to the Journal News. An autopsy has not been scheduled, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner said.

Miss Corey-Ochoa planned to double major in English and mathematics, she had told the Rivertowns Daily Voice in June.

'I’m not sure if I’m ready to say anything at all about my daughter,' said her father, George Ochoa, himself a graduate of Columbia

Cheryl Beer, 54, a neighbour of the family’s for 14 years who used to direct musicals at the high school, said the 'talented' and 'dedicated' girl played violin in the pit band.

Her parents are writers and her mother, Melinda, has taught at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, neighbours said.

Jennifer Dawber, 52, said she recently congratulated Miss Corey-Ochoa's parents after they dropped her off at Columbia.

She described the 18-year-old as kind, polite and extremely intelligent and said it seemed as though Miss Corey-Ochoa was always in the newspaper for receiving academic awards.

It has been reported that the high achiever had been treated for mental health issues in the past and was taking undisclosed medications.

'We are terribly saddened to tell you of the untimely death of one of our Class of 2012 graduates, Martha Corey-Ochoa,' said Dobbs Ferry schools superintendent Lisa Brady to the New York Post.

'A brilliant student and last year’s valedictorian, Martha had just begin her freshman year at Columbia University.'

The brilliant student excelled at music, Spanish language, math and writing and was described as 'completely devoted' to her parents.

'She was a quiet girl, a very studious girl,' said Roberta Reynolds, a neighbour of the family.

'Whatever happened, she was not used to being away from the family.

'If she did do this, it's because she didn't want to disappoint her family.

'I don't know how the family will cope without her.'

Other devastated neighbours spoke of a 'driven' student, who would have been successful in any field she had chosen.

'There was no question she was going to be successful,' said neighbour Cheryl Beer.

'Everything she did she was driven to do.

'We used to hear her playing violin when most kids were out playing.'

One mother whose daughter attended the same class as Corey-Ochoa said that death of the Columbia student was 'a tragedy for the community.'

'She never said a bad word about anybody,' said Julie Lowery.

'She didn't gossip.

'She liked to go out to dinner, to go out for ice cream.'

'I feel like she had such a great future. I hope her family can get some peace. I still can't believe it'.

Roberta Reynolds, 58, a neighbour of the family's for 13 years, said their daughter, an only child, was quiet, respectful and devoted to her parents.

'Martha was their life.'

The teenager baked cookies for Ms Reynolds at Christmas and gave her a card. When she was young, Ms Reynolds gave her little toys including stuffed animals and bracelets and said she often saw Martha helping her mother in the garden.

'She was a very intelligent girl, a wonderful musician, and she was very devoted to her parents. She was a very caring daughter. She was looking forward to excelling at school.'

A university security officer said a paramedic and a nurse had been seen by a student running out of the hospital.

'We were walking down and we just saw her there,' the student told the officer.

Dean of Student Affairs Kevin Shollenberger informed students of the death in an email sent around 2:15am, calling the death a tragedy.

'It's a time that our community needs to pull together and support one another,' Mr Shollenberger said.

'Our returning students should keep in mind our first-year students have just gotten here, and they are developing contacts and relationships and should be sensitive and reach out to one another.'

He said religious advisers and counsellors would be on hand today to talk to students and staff.

At 5.20am he sent another email revealing her name and writing: 'Martha was passionate about mathematics and literature, and recognized as a very talented writer.

'We extend our deepest condolences to the family of this student. As we continue to cope with the loss of one of our valued community members, we remain committed to ensuring the health and well being of our Columbia family.'
