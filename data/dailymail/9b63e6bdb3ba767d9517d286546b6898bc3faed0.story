A driver has admitted to mowing down and killing his heavily pregnant girlfriend just three weeks before she was due to give birth to their daughter.

Daniel Dutfield, 24, today pleaded guilty to running over his girlfriend of six years, Jessica Fenner, 22, near his family home in Morden, Surrey, in July.

Miss Fenner, who was just 24 days away from giving birth, was rushed to hospital but casualty doctors were unable to save her and her unborn baby and they died hours later.

Her boyfriend, who had only been driving for a year, was arrested after the crash and later charged with causing death by dangerous driving.

Appearing via video link from High Down prison in Surrey, Dutfield pleaded  'guilty' to the dangerous driving charge.

Tearful members of Miss Fenner's family gasped and hugged each other in the public gallery at Croydon Crown Court. 

Recorder Warwick McKinnon immediately adjourned sentencing.

Miss Fenner, from Wallington, south west London, is understood to have been due to give birth to a girl on July 30.

The couple are believed to have been together since 2008 and had recently moved into a flat when she was killed.

She had posted a string of messages on Facebook saying how excited she was about her life with Dutfield.

In one message, written on June 26, she wrote: 'So happy with my new flat can't wait to start moving stuff in - feeling excited.'

The 21-year-old also posted on June 9 this year saying she felt her life was 'finally' coming together after she found a new flat to live in with Dutfield ahead of the birth of their baby girl.

On July 4 last year she told friends that her boyfriend had passed his driving test first time, writing: 'Well done dan for passing his driving test first time so proud of you love u loads x.' 

The mother-to-be, who worked at hardware store Wilkinsons, also asked for suggestions for the name of her baby girl and posted ultrasound scans showing the baby to friends. 

Friends struggled to come to terms with the news of Miss Fenner's death.

Jenny Meadows said: 'I sincerely cannot believe that such a lovely young women such as Jessica Fenner is gone so soon.

'I used to work with Jessica and every time I was in a bad mood or needed help she was always there for me.

'I will always miss her lovely personality.'

Tom Edwards, who went to Stanley Park High School with Miss Fenner, added: 'She was a very nice young lady. She was attractive and friendly and had a lot of friends. I was very sad and upset when I heard the news.'

Others took to Facebook to express their sadness. Ally Bee-Bowley said: 'Poor poor Jess... Her whole life ahead of her. RIP Hun.'

Kelly Mac added: 'Can't believe it, I'm in shock, so so sad.'
