A sham wedding was busted by immigration officers - moments before the fake bride and groom said 'I do'.

Officers arrived just in time to stop the fake wedding in Hull, East Yorkshire, between a 33-year-old Pakistani groom and a 27-year-old Hungarian bride.

Five people were arrested, including the bride, who was wearing a full, white wedding dress and the smartly dressed groom.

Three wedding 'guests' - a Pakistani man, 48, a Hungarian man, 44, and a Hungarian woman, 23 - were also arrested, following intelligence which suggested the couple's relationship was not genuine.

The Hungarian bride, 27, was escorted from the Hull Register Office, by an immigration officer on Thursday

The ceremony was about to start at the Hull Register Office, at 2pm on Thursday, when the officers interrupted the big day to make the arrests.

The action comes amid growing fears that people with European Union citizenship are being paid thousands of pounds to marry non-EU citizens, allowing them to stay in Britain.

Mark Bates, of Home Office Criminal Investigations, said: 'Where we receive information that a wedding may be suspicious we will investigate and, if necessary, intervene and arrest those involved.

'This investigation will now continue following the arrests we have made and the evidence we have seized.'

The Pakistani groom, pictured centre, was questioned by immigration officers after intelligence suggested the couple's relationship was not genuine 

At the time, Detective Sergeant Andy Norris, of the UK Border Agency, said: 'We are confident we have caught these illegal activities before Hull is made a hub for this sort of crime. 

'People who think they can use Hull in this way will need to think again.'

The 'bride' and 'groom' are now being questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law, along with the 48-year-old man.

The 23-year-old woman has been released on bail pending further investigations and the 44-year-old man has been released without charge.
