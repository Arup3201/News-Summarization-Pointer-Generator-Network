Celebrated painter LeRoy Neiman, whose colourful brushstrokes captured the motion and energy of stars across the sporting world, has died aged 91.

Neiman was the official painter of five Olympic Games and was a contributing artist at Playboy magazine for many years.

But he was also was a portraitist who depicted some of the world's most iconic figures, including Frank Sinatra and Babe
Ruth, in a style that conveyed their public image.

Colourful character: LeRoy Neiman died on Wednesday of an undisclosed illness. He was 91

One face he recorded over and over again
was that of Muhammad Ali. Those paintings and sketches, representing 15
years of the fighter's professional life, permanently reside at the 
LeRoy Neiman Gallery at the Muhammad Ali Centre in Louisville, Kentucky.

'I
am less concerned with how people look when they wake,' he said. 'A 
person's public presence reflects his own efforts at image development.'

His long-time publicist, Gail 
Parenteau, confirmed his death at a Manhattan hospital on Wednesday but 
did not disclose the cause.

Neiman was a media-savvy artist who 
knew how to enthrall audiences with his instant renditions of what he 
observed. In 1972, he sketched the world chess tournament between Boris 
Spassky and Bobby Fischer in Reykjavik, Iceland, for a live television 
audience. He also produced live drawings of the Olympics for TV and was 
the official computer artist of the Super Bowl for CBS.

Neiman's
'reportage of history and the passing scene ... revived an almost lost 
and time-honoured art form', according to a 1972 exhibit of his Olympics
sketches at Indianapolis Museum of Art.

'It's been fun. I've had a lucky life,' Neiman said in a June 2008 interview.

'I've zeroed in on what you would call
action and excellence. Everybody who does anything to try to succeed 
has to give the best of themselves, and art has made me pull the best 
out of myself.'

Neiman's 
paintings, many executed in household enamel paints that allowed him his
fast-moving strokes, are an explosion in reds, blues, pinks, greens and
yellows.

He has been 
described as an American impressionist, but the Minnesota native 
preferred to think of himself simply as an American artist.

He worked in many media, producing thousands of etchings, lithographs and silkscreen prints known as serigraphy.

But Neiman's critics said his forays into the commercial world minimised him as a serious artist. At Playboy, for example, he created Femlin, the well-endowed nude who has graced the magazine's Party Jokes page since 1957.

Neiman was fascinated with large game animals and said he twice travelled to Kenya to paint lions and elephants in the bush in his trademark vibrant palette.

But it was the essence of a basketball or gridiron game, swimming meet or cycling event that captured his imagination most.

'For an artist, watching a (Joe) Namath throw a football or a Willie Mays hit a baseball is an experience far more overpowering than painting a beautiful woman or leading political figure,' Neiman said in 1972.

With his sketchbook and pencil, trademark handlebar moustache and slicked-back hair, Neiman was instantly recognisable.

At a New York Jets game at Shea Stadium in 1975, fans yelled, 'Put LeRoy in', when the play was not going their way.

Neiman's decades-long association with
Playboy began in 1953 following a chance meeting with Hugh Hefner. It 
was the start of what he called 'the good life' and inspiration for much
of his future work.

He 
regularly contributed to the magazine's 'Man at His Leisure' feature, 
which took him to such places as the Grand National and Ascot race 
meetings in England, the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Grand 
Prix F1 race in Monaco.

Hefner said 'RIP' to his 'long-time friend' in a tweet last night.

Neiman was a Second World War veteran who participated in the invasion of Normandy and fought in the Battle of the Bulge.

He
was a self-described workaholic who seldom took vacations and had no 
hobbies. He worked daily in his home studio at the Hotel des Artistes 
near Central Park, New York, which he shared with his wife.

'What else am I good for?' he said in 2008. 'I don't think about anything else.'

One of his projects, a 160-foot-long sports mural, hung in the Sports Museum of America in Manhattan.

Accolades: Neiman was inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame and the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Other awards included a 2002 Friars Club Tribute and a 2004 Ellis Island Medal of Honour

Over the years, Neiman endowed a number of institutions, donating 6 million dollars in 1995 for the creation of the LeRoy Neiman Centre for Print Studies at Columbia University and 3 million dollars to his alma mater, the Art Institute of Chicago, where he taught for a decade.

He also donated a million dollars to create a permanent home for Arts Horizons, a community art centre in Harlem.

Neiman earned numerous accolades. He was inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame and the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Other awards included a 2002 Friars Club Tribute and a 2004 Ellis Island Medal of Honour.

His works are in the permanent collections of many private and public museums. The Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC was selected by Neiman to house his archives.

Neiman is survived by his wife of 55 years, Janet Byrne Neiman.
