German  Chancellor Angela Merkel seemed less than amused during a performance ahead of the Carnival season where the dancers wore next-to-nothing from the waist down.

The Chancellor made a disapproving face and looked away as the young ladies performed headstand splits, however the two men flanking her looked both pleased and impressed.

Ms Merkel was treated to the performance at the Chancellery in Berlin prior to the start of the annual carnival season, and joined several of the performers on the floor when they were done with their routine. 

Not amused: German Chancellor Angela Merkel appears to disapprove as she watches a traditional Carnival performance at the Chancellery

So it begins: The Chancellor was surrounded by a 'court' of Carnival Princes and Princesses from every German state that celebrates Carnival  

Ms Merkel appeared to cheer up when the girls got back on their feet, but poignantly looked away again when another headstand came along

It is tradition for the Chancellor to receive the Carnival Princes and Princesses from Germany's 'Carnival Clubs' ahead of its start.

Carnival, known as Karneval, Fasching or Fastnacht, is mainly celebrated in Cologne and the Rhineland but also in other parts of the country and Austria.

Carnival season officially starts on the 11th November at 11.11am, but properly kicks off in the new year.

Mardi Gras-style festivities, which sees each Carnival town elect a Prince and Princess, culminates on Ash Wednesday ahead of Lent, with some regional differences.

The German Carnival tradition dates back to medieval times and the biggest party is held in the city of Cologne, where Carnival has been celebrated since 1234.
