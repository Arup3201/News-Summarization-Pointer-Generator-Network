Shot dead: Monroe Isadore, age 107, of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was killed in a standoff with a police SWAT team on Saturday

The 80-year-old Arkansas woman who called police on her 107-year-old roommate on Saturday said today that the SWAT officers who got into a standoff with the man had no choice but to shoot him. But his friends don't agree.

Pauline Lewis, of Pine Bluff, said centenarian Monroe Isadore barricaded himself in his bedroom with a pistol and threatened to fire at anyone who came near the door.

'He was very angry. He got hostile. He was gonna kill somebody,' Lewis said of the man who then died after entering into a gun fight with authorities.

The woman said that Isadore had lived
with her for a month but that he got violent when she asked him to find
another apartment. 

Lewis told THV that he shut himself in: 'Monroe was in the room and he had the gun and he said 'If you wanna live you better get away from this door.' 

She called the police and when the SWAT team arrived the 107-year-old suspect had his gun trained at two people in the room.

Officers had the pair leave the home for their own safety and approached a bedroom looking for Isadore.

When the officers announced who they were, Isadore shot through the door at them but missed hitting them, said Pine Bluff Lt. David Price in a news release.

The officers retreated to a safer area, and supervisors and additional help were called, Price said.

Supervisors started negotiating with Isadore and continued after SWAT officers arrived at the home about 45 miles southeast of Little Rock.

The SWAT team inserted a camera into the room and confirmed Isadore was armed with a handgun, Price said.

When it was clear the negotiations weren't working, SWAT officers released gas into the room from outside a bedroom window. 

SWAT officers entered the home, made their way to the bedroom and threw a 'distraction device' into the room, Price said.

He said Isadore began to fire at the officers and they fired back, killing him.

Lewis told THV: 'I think they didn't have a choice but to shoot him after they had put the teargas in and everything. He refused and he shot first.'

Isadore's friends weren't so sure. Larry Smith went to the same church as the 107-year-old. He told Arkansasmatters.com: 'I'm in shock today.'

Smith said that Isadore was legally blind and had poor hearing. 'He couldn't hear,' Smith said. 'Somebody should've told the [police] he couldn't hear.'

He also believes that the man would have been highly confused after the SWAT team released tear gas and the distraction device.
