The family of a naval officer who has been deployed for four long years has been forced to take down a sign they made to welcome him home to Louisiana.

Petty Officer Third Class Anthony Marsiglia has been deployed on an aircraft carrier and is due to arrive home in Lafayette in the next few weeks, something his family, particularly his eight-year-old daughter, is extremely excited about.

They made a sign that reads 'WELCOME HOME DADDY,' signed 'We love you. Mom, Pop and ALEX.'

Deployed: Anthony Marsiglia has been away from home since his daughter was four years old

Homecoming: Marsiglia's family made a sign to welcome him back but were ordered to take it down by the Homeowner's Association

The family told KATC that they were sent a lengthy letter from the Home Owner's Association (HOA) telling them they had to take the sign down because it violated the association's rules - without specifying which exact rule the sign was breaking.

Judi Pellegran, Marsiglia's mother said that she's bewildered by the demand.

'I'm just not quite understanding why it can't stay up and they haven't been able to explain that to me either,' said Pellegran.

Seaman: Marsiglia's family says they made the sign to show him how much they've missed him and how proud they are of him

'He's out there and he's left his daughter, that's hard already for him. This is how she keeps him in her heart everyday and clearly, if you see the house, it's a homage to her daddy,' she told the station.

When Pellegran questioned the letter, an attorney highlighted a section of the homeowner's rules specifying that a sign may be no larger than 24 by 36 inches - but the family's sign is within those dimensions.

'I love him big': Alex says she's proud of her dad but wishes he didn't have to go away with the Navy

When notified of the size of the sign, the HOA attorney responded that 'The remaining problems are the failure of preapproval and the permanent display. The Board has met and advises that it does not allow permanent signs.'

In a statement to KATC, the HOA said it has hired a mediator to work with homeowner Chester Pellegran, Marsigliaâ€™s father, to 'create a dialogue in hopes of working out a solution.'

The family is meeting with the association this weekend and hopes to discover the reason they couldn't have their sign up year-round, if they so desired.

Meanwhile, all Alex Marsiglia wants is her dad.

'I love him big,' she told KATC.

'I wish he wasn't in the Navy.'
