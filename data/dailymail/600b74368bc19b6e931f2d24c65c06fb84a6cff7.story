The Galatasaray squad looked sharp in their suits as they arrived in England for their clash with Arsenal.

The Turkish side flew in to London ahead of Wednesday's Champions League group game in matching outfits - reminiscent of Liverpool's Spice Boys, but with slightly more taste. 

The pictures show Burak Yilmaz, Selcuk Inan, Aurelien Chedjou, Yasin Oztekin, Sinan Bolat, Goran Pandev, Wesley Sneijder and Felipe Melo on the plane, as well as Hamit Altintop leading the squad off the plane.

The Gunners will be hoping to get their first point of the competition, while Cesare Prandelli's side are aiming for their first win.

The Turks drew 1-1 with Belgian side Anderlecht in their opening game while Arsenal were humiliated by Dortmund in Germany.

There is some good news for Arsene Wenger's side, though, in the form of some injury news. 

Jack Wilshere trained normally while Theo Walcott and Serge Gnabry were also back out with the rest of the squad at London Colney.
