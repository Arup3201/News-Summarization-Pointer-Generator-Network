Hip hop's biggest names have been immortalised in a cookbook as a selection of tasty dishes.

From Snoop (Dogg) stroganoff to (Missy) Tiramisu Elliot, the hottest rappers from today and yesteryear inspire their own classic recipe with a twist in Rapper's Delight: The Hip Hop Cookbook.

Delights include thirty dishes such as Ludacrispy Duck, Public Enemiso Soup and Run DM Sea Bass. The tome takes a light hearted look at music and is evenly split into three categories of starters, mains and desserts.

Rapper's Delight celebrates the many humorous parallels between food and hip hop, making it a kitchen essential for anyone with a penchant for cooking, music or illustration. Or indeed all three. 

Aside from the odd innuendo such as 'Ho-Sin Sauce' - the book is expletive-free, making it more family-friendly than many of the songs by your favourite rappers.  

The concept is the brainchild of Joseph Inniss, who authored the tome. He is a self-confessed 'massive foodie', who enjoys creating dishes based on traditional recipes - with a twist.

Peter Stadden designed the layout. He is a graphic designer and big hip hop fan. Previously working as an art director in the design/lifestyle magazine sector, Peter has since moved into interiors.

Ralph Miller, the editor of the book, has a background in TV production and newspaper journalism.

We aren't chefs but we're all keen foodies and love cooking,' says Ralph.

'The ideas for the recipes came from the rap artists and then we designed recipes to fit with their names, songs and their characteristics etc. For example - the name "A Pie Called Quest" came first, but due to their song "Bonita Applebum" we used appley cider in the pie where you might instead use ale. 

'We are all fans of hip hop music and the book gave us the chance to combine our love for hip hop with our love for cooking. We don't personally know any of the featured rappers but have links to one or two through friends of friends and through the publishers. 

'We are big fans of all the artists featured; the book is meant to be a tribute to them and that is why we have made reference to our favourite songs. We hope people will enjoy the puns and the artwork, can learn some new recipes and discover hip hop artists they might not be so familiar with.

'I was at school with Peter and at university with Joe, so we all go way back. The experience of long meetings spent planning the book, checking for typos and organising the launch party have certainly brought us closer together.'

Famous rappers lend their views on the humorous read. 

'There are all aspects of hip hop, but the best of it has unique blending of ingredients, detailed preparation as well as great taste,' said Chuck D from Public Enemy.

'Rapper's Delight connects like great food, makes too much sense,' he said.

Each of the recipes is accompanied by a bespoke piece of artwork created by one of thirty of the best upcoming illustrators. They include Tom Clohessy Cole, who designed the cover, Hattie Stewart, who created the Public Enemiso Soup illustration, and Andy Baker, who drew up the Wu-Tang Clam Chowder image.
