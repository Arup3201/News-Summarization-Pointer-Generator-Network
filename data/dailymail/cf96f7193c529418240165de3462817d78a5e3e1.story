Heavy rain and strong wind has battered much of Britain, with fierce thunderstorms hitting London as the Met Office issued severe weather warnings.

Shoppers were left drenched in fierce downpours across the south, while sports fans at football, rugby and horse racing meetings were hit by torrential rain.

London was struck by a fierce electrical storm in later afternoon, with lightning strikes cracking across the sky, pouring rain and hailstones pelting the city.

The thunderstorms also struck across the Midlands and into East Anglia, with winds of more than 50mph reported yesterday afternoon.

Rain will continue to lash the country into the start of next week

Britain faces further flooding today as another band of heavy rain sweeps the country – prompting one MP to call for the Army to be put on standby.

The saturated South West will bear the brunt, with blustery wet weather lasting several days.

Severe weather warnings were issued yesterday by the Met Office for all of the South West, and the Environment Agency said already full rivers are likely to burst their banks.

There is also potential for further river flooding across the south west and southern counties.The risk of flooding from groundwater continues in parts of Wiltshire, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, West Berkshire and Surrey into next week.

Low-lying areas of Somerset – where 
villages have been only reachable by boat for a month – will be 
particularly hard hit. The county is nearing breaking point, its council
 leader John Osman warned.

West
 Somerset MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said floods in his region were the 
worst for a century, adding: ‘I have told the Prime Minister we need 
extra pumping capacity and we may also need help from the military.’

He
 spoke after local councils declared a full-scale emergency. Somerset 
County Council said: ‘We’ve asked the Army to come up with solutions.’

Somerset County Council has declared a 'major incident' for all areas affected by flooding in the county.

Deputy chief executive Pat Flaherty 
said: 'Our priority has to be to keep people safe. We are doing 
everything we can to do this and we believe that declaring a major 
incident shows just how urgent the situation is for many of our 
residents and communities.

'The
 reason we are taking this action is the long-term nature of the issues 
we are facing and to enable a consistent approach to the way that we 
deal with them.'

The county council will continue its 
help and support for people affected by flooding which includes a boat 
service for the cut-off community of Muchelney and Thorney, providing a 
pontoon bridge at Langport, supporting farmers providing a vital tractor
 service to communities, keeping roads open and evacuating residents 
when necessary.

Sedgemoor District Council has also declared a 'major incident' on the Somerset Levels.

Many
 communities are still coming to terms with the flooding that hit 
Somerset at the beginning of January and now face further problems.

The Environment Agency has issued ten 
flood warnings across the South of England. Parts of Wiltshire, Dorset, 
Hampshire, West Sussex, Berkshire and Surrey are also at risk.

A spokesman said: 'With the ground already 
saturated, rivers and groundwater levels remain very responsive to 
rainfall, particularly on the Somerset Levels.

'Environment Agency 
teams continue to operate up to 62 pumps 24 hours a day to drain an 
estimated 65 million cubic metres of floodwater off an area of the 
Levels spanning 65 square kilometres.'

The Met Office said: ‘There is potential to see nearly an inch of rain across the South West on Sunday.’

The Met Office issued an amber warning of
 severe weather for the south west, from 6am to 2pm today saying: 'More 
heavy rain will spread east across the area on Sunday. Given the current
 disruption on the Somerset Levels, the public should be prepared for 
further flooding.
