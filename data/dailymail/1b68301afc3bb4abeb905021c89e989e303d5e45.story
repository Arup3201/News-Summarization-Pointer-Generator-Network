In any normal race, the car would be disqualified instantly - not only is it made of cardboard and plywood, it's also powered by explosive hydrogen.

But the Shell Eco-Marathon is a hotbed for wacky vehicles - and the plywood car, designed by students at Aston University in Birmingham, is a hot contender.

It drew up on the starting grid alongside other eco-friendly vehicles in Kuala Lumpur today.

The chassis of the car was constructed using a plywood and cardboard honeycomb composite - it was entered into a race this week

The car was entered in the Shell Eco-Marathon 2012

A team of students from Birmingham's Aston University designed the wooden vehicle

'The car we are building will be entered into the 'urban concept' 
category and will be powered by a Nexa Ballard Hydrogen Fuel Cell,' says the team of students behind the vehicle.

'As 
it's an eco-marathon, we are trying to be as sustainable as possible in 
the entire design of the car- making the chassis out of cardboard and 
plywood and using bio-resin infused fibres for body panels.'

The car was built by a team of undergraduate Engineering and Design students in Birmingham, UK.

It has already won a design award in a competition against 200 design teams from 24 different universities.

Their innovative car, which runs on hydrogen, has a body
made from cardboard sandwiched between plywood certified by the British
Forestry Commission.

Its tyre covers are made from bio-resin, infused 
with hessian fibres, with the whole structure collapsible for easy 
delivery.

The car entered the Shell Eco-Marathon 2012 - the way to win is to design a vehicle that can travel as far as possible on a limited amount of fuel

Other competitors in this year's Shell Eco Marathon include a streamlined vehicle that can do 584mpg.

Called the Lamina – it was built by a 
team of engineers from the California Polytechnic State University.

It’s powered by a modified Honda generator and can hit 25mph flat out. Its low fuel consumption is partly achieved by coasting.

Slow and steady: Lamina will get you far - but can only reach 25mph

Wheel-y clever: The Lamina demonstrates that gas-guzzling is strictly necessary
