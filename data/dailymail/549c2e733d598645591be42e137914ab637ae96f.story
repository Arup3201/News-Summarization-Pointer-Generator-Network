A teenage boy has been caught using his bedroom as an illegal tattoo parlour to ink his friends, after advertising his services on Facebook.

Up to 15 children - some as young as 13 - paid the DIY tattooist their £5 pocket money for the 'body art' while his unsuspecting parents watched television downstairs.

But the illegal practice was soon discovered after the parents of a 14-year-old girl complained to Trading Standards when she  home with a tattoo on her leg.

Kitted out: the 15-year-old was found with a range of equipment in his bedroom, which he had turned into an illegal tattoo parlour

After raiding the schoolboy's bedroom in Blackpool, Lancashire, officers found a tattooist's kit under his bed with a stained 'skull and crossbones' tattoo machine and contaminated needles.

They also recovered a blender for the inks, rubber gloves and tracing paper for designs including hearts, butterflies and swallows.

It is believed the 15-year-old boy had attempted to sterilise the needles using household Dettol, hand gel and Savlon cream.

The boy was questioned on suspicion of an offence under the Tattooing of Minors Act of 1969, but no further action was taken against him after he was given a formal warning and the kit was confiscated.

The youngsters tattooed by the boy are believed to have been advised to undergo health checks tests.

Pictures of the boy's extensive tattoo kit emerged as council inspectors said youngsters who had paid for the tattoos were 'taking their life in their hands' by risking deadly infections, including hepatitis, HIV and blood poisoning.

Infection risk: The teenager had tried to disinfect his needles with household products

It is illegal in Britain to tattoo 
anyone under the age of 18 except when the tattoo is performed for medical reasons by a duly qualified medical practitioner or by a person working under their direction.

The maximum sentence for those convicted of tattooing under age youngsters can be a fine of up to a £1,000 pounds.

But tattoos remain popular among children who attempt to copy their celebrity heroes.

Councillor
Fred Jackson at Blackpool Council, said: 'It's shocking to think the 
risks that young people are taking using unregistered tattooists.

'We
work very closely with the parlours in the town to ensure that anyone 
having a tattoo is doing so in a safe and hygiene environment.

'I
understand that the equipment can be bought from as little as £50 on 
eBay, making it more accessible than ever to those wanting to make a 
quick buck.

'The last thing we want is young people making a bad decision that could cause permanent damage and impact on their health.'

The council said over the last two months there had been an increased concerns about underage children being tattooed.

Discovered: This stained skull and crossbones tattoo gun was found under the teenager's bed

Officials have fielded reports of 
children as young as 13 obtaining tattoos, along with concerns over 
infected equipment, poor quality workmanship and the risk of disease.

Inquiries
have revealed that the main source of the problem is from people 
setting up illegal make shift tattoo studios from home.

The
boy's bedroom was one of two properties targeted by Blackpool Council 
and the police using new powers aimed at safeguarding public safety.

The
law requires any person who operates as a tattooist to be registered 
with the local authority and comply with a code of conduct focusing on 
cleanliness, sterilisation of equipment and the overall hygiene and 
facilities of the premises.

Blackpool Council is now beginning an awareness campaign working with Blackpool and the Fylde College and local schools to highlight the dangers.

Catherine Hill, vice principal at Blackpool and the Fylde College, said: 'The College is happy to raise awareness among young people about the risks posed by illegal tattooing.

'There are many pressures on young 
people today and by keeping our students informed while in college, we 
will hopefully help to make sure that they can stay safe in the outside 
world.'

Pete Sinclair 
from Hawkeye's Tattoo Carnival, added: 'People getting a cheap tattoo in
a makeshift studio don't know the real cost of what they are doing.

'Picking up an infection in an unhygienic environment could cause serious health problems or at worse, their life.'

Keith Butcher, who runs Dragons Den tattoo studio, in Blackpool said: 'The biggest risk is cross-contamination with people not cleaning the eqUipment properly. It's a hepatitis lottery.

'One of the reasons we bought a tattoo removal machine is because of the atrocious standard of work which is being done not just by kids, but by a lot of adults as well from bedrooms and garages.

'We've seen a big increase in it over the last 12 to 14 months.'

Simon Tucker, a consultant doctor at Blackpool Victoria Hospital's accident and emergency department said anyone inked in unhygienic conditions was taking a 'big risk'.

He added: 'Sterilising needles in Savlon is not a chemical, sterile procedure. It carries a huge risk, not only of infections such as cellulitis, but also blood-born viruses, most notably hepatitis and HIV, which can be transmitted through dirty needles.'
