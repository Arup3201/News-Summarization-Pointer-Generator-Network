The parents of an eight-month-old baby unwittingly caused a Twitter storm when they brought the infant along to Chicago's Michelin three-star temple to gastronomy Alinea on Saturday night.

Chef Grant Achatz fielded complaints from other diners at the $265-per-head (not including tax and tip) restaurant and took to Twitter to poll the masses.

'Tbl brings 8mo.Old. It cries. Diners mad. Tell ppl no kids? Subject diners 2crying? Ppl take infants 2 plays? Concerts? Hate saying no,but..' he wrote.

Twitter storm: Chef Grant Achatz unwitting opened a Pandora's box when he tweeted about banning babies at his fine dining restaurant Alinea

Sophisticated: Some are of the opinion that the understated chic of $265-a-head Alinea is lost on babies

The tweet provoked a flurry of replies in favor of banning babies from fine dining restaurants, and surprisingly few 140-word treatises against it.

It seems diners were just waiting for an opportunity to air their outrage at the presence of an infant human at a grown-up restaurant.

'Charge the infant for a full menu. That will stop it quickly,' suggested one.

'You choose to have a child (it's not mandatory or forced on anyone), then ya give up some other things. Like dinner at Next,' said another.Others were more direct: 'Wait. Someone brought an infant to Alinea? What in the actual f***?'

As many pointed out, the Alinea experience is pricey, a very special night out for most people.

'I'd be livid if I came to Next, Alinea, or ANY fine dining establishment and had to sit through a crying baby,' tweeted Richard LaRue.

But the unique booking system for Alinea may have been the reason for the dinner date plus one.

The restaurant sells tickets like a play or concert. If something goes wrong - for example, if the babysitter cancels - there's no refund.

Before the day was out, the controversy had become much more interesting in a Chinese whispers style evolution of the original story.

Crying shame: If the couple were indeed left in the lurch by a babysitter, their only option was to bring baby or lose their $500

'Quickly scanning Twitter. Did Achatz eat/serve baby?' tweeted Josh Steinfeld.'So .... A friend of a friend told me that a woman gave birth while dining at Alinea last night ... Achatz delivered the baby ... Wow! LOL' wrote brbinchicago.

Not to be outdone, the baby in question also decided to share its side of the story. By the end of the day, the saga had spawned an AlineaBaby Twitter account.

Eager to tell his or her side of the story, AlineaBaby recounted the evening, apparently while in a first class lounge at the airport waiting to board a plane to New York - for dinner at Per se.

According to AlineaBaby, his or her father had left his or her mother when she went on a strict healthy diet while pregnant.

The Alinea tickets were a gift from the baby to the mother and her new beau.

The baby appreciated the 'three kinds of unpasteurized breast milk as well as the foie gras, but became bored after 13 courses.

According to chef Grant Achatz, he has just filmed a short segment for Good Morning America about the difficulties of hosting babies in fine dining restaurants.
