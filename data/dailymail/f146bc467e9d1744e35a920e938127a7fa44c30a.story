Bill Belichick may have been fined for his on-field conduct over the weekend, but at least the New England Patriots coach has some cash to spare thanks to the sale of his New York love nest.

The NFL slapped a fine of $50,000 on Belichick after he grabbed a replacement referee during the game Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens.

But the fine came amid a report that the crinkle-browed coach is parting with his townhouse in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, and making bank on it - a total of $550,000.

Love nest: Belichick reportedly dished out $2.2million for this townhouse in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, when he was with Shannon Shenocca

High-priced pad: The townhouse includes five bedrooms, three bathrooms and a backyard

The New York Observer reported that Belichick recently sold the house, complete with its five bedrooms and three bathrooms, for $2.75million.

Belichick reportedly purchased the high-priced pad for $2.2million in 2007 as a love nest to share with his then-girlfriend Sharon Shenocca, who was the receptionist for the New York Giants, after his marriage to Debby Clarke crumbled.

He has since been romantically linked to Linda Holliday, a correspondent for WCVB-TVâ€™s StyleBoston.

Belichick grabbed an official's arm at the end of Sunday night's game after the Ravens kicked a game-winning field goal.

He first claimed he was just looking for answers when he grabbed the official.

'So when the game was over, I went out and I was really looking for an explanation from the officials as to whether the play was under review,' he said, 'and I did try to get the official's attention as he was coming off the field to ask that, but I really wasn't able to do that.'

But by Wedneday, Belichick changed his tune and accepted the punishment.

'It was inappropriate for me to contact the official. I take responsibility for what happened,' Belichick said in statement released by the team.

Acceptance: Belichick called his behaviour at Sunday's game 'inappropriate' and accepted the fine

'I accept the discipline and I apologize for the incident Sunday night in Baltimore.'

Also, the NFL said Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh won't be fined for making contact with a game official during Sunday's 31-30 win over New England.

Ray Anderson, the NFL's vice president of football operations, said Harbaugh did not violate the rule regarding abuse of officials.

The Belichick fine was one of many that have been handed out by the NFL this week as a result of interactions with replacement refs.

Anger: Belichick was one of several coaches to be punished by the NFL for actions directed at replacement refs

Washington Redskins assistant Kyle Shanahan was fined $25,000 on Wednesday for his conduct toward replacement officials.

Shanahan, the son of Redskins coach Mike Shanahan, was called for unsportsmanlike conduct for berating officials in the final seconds of the Redskins' 38-31 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.

He also confronted an official in a stadium tunnel after the game.

On Monday, the league fined Broncos coach John Fox $30,000 and defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio $25,000 for berating officials during a loss to Atlanta on September 17.
