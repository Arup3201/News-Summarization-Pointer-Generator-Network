Burgled: Mike Tyson, pictured here starring in The Hangover as himself, was sleeping when the intruder broke in to his hotel suite

A tip-toeing intruder has been dubbed the world's bravest (or most stupid) burglar - after he broke into Mike Tyson's hotel room as the ex-boxer was sleeping.

The raider fled the suite at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas after Iron Mike, infamous for biting off an opponent's ear in a bout, woke to the sound of rustling.

It was a lucky escape for the thief, who could have been on the end of Tyson's powerful right hook had the heavyweight been fully alert.

Nothing was taken in the break-in and security at the resort, where top suites cost up to $1,500 per night, has now been stepped up.

Knock-out Hollywood actor Tyson, who floored a burglar as he played himself in The Hangover film after his tiger was stolen, was staying at the hotel with his family on New Year's Eve after attending a Stevie Wonder concert.

The TMZ website reported: 'We're told Tyson was sleeping like a baby when all of a sudden, he awoke to rustling sounds and saw a flashlight.

'But by the time Iron Mike realized what was happening, the intruder had already run out of the room.'

A hotel spokesman added: 'We have received a report of an incident that is currently under investigation. As always, guest safety is of the utmost importance.'

The run-in with the sleepy pugilistic pigeon-fancier, who raises the racing variety of the bird in his spare time, should be considered a lucky escape.

Intruder: The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is one of the city's plushest resorts, where top suites can cost more than $1,500 per night

The former boxing champion, 45, was jailed for three years in 1992 for raping a beauty pageant contestant in Indianapolis.

Several years later, he spent three months in jail for beating up two men after a minor car crash in suburban Washington.

He also bit a piece out of Evander Holyfield's ear during a bout, and once threatened to eat the children of heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.

His life was also touched by tragedy in 2009 when his four-year-old daughter Exodus died after an accident in her Phoenix home.

Down for the count: Mike Tyson (left) became the youngest heavyweight champion when he beat Trevor Berbick (right) in 1986

She was found with her neck caught in 
the power cable of a treadmill machine, was rushed to hospital and put 
on a life support machine, but then died.

Tyson first began boxing at a centre for juvenile delinquents in upstate New York at the age of 12.

Eight years later he became the youngest heavyweight champion when he knocked out Trevor Berbick in 1986.

But in 1990, he was defeated by James 'Buster' Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.
