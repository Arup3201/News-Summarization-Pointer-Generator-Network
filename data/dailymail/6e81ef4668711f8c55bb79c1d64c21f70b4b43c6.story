This young kangaroo proves what it means to bounce back from adversity.

Blue Gum was orphaned by recent raging Australian bushfires but is gradually being nursed back to health at a wildlife centre.

And carers hope the four-month-old will soon be on the mend and jumping for joy.

Bouncing back: Blue Gum was rescued from the pouch of his dying mother during sweeping bushfires

Orphan: The baby kangaroo's mother did not survive and he is being cared for at Wildhaven Wildlife Centre

Blue Gum was rescued by a passer-by from his mother's pouch as the Donnybrook fire swept through Melbourne's northern suburbs.

However, the joey's mother did not survive the blaze and he was taken to the Wildhaven wildlife shelter.

Carer Stella Reid said without the man's intervention, Blue Gum would have died as well.

She said: 'If a member of the public hadn't been out checking their own animals and spotted his legs sticking from his mother's pouch, he would've died.'

The Donnybrook fire started on February 18 and the grassfire soon became out of control.

It eventually burned more than 5,000 acres of land as it headed towards the suburbs.

It took 170 firefighters and 40 trucks to battle the flames into submission.

But despite his traumatic start, Blue Gum is already bonding with other animals at the 104-acre shelter.

He will now stay with Stella for the next two years until he is old enough to be set free.

Relaxing: Blue Gum will be cared for at the wildlife centre for two years. In the wild he would have stayed in his mother's pouch until he was at least eight months old

Deadly: Thousands of livestock and unknown numbers of wildlife have perished in the devastating bushfires

The Australian bushfire season has been one of the worst in living memory spurred on by an intense heatwave.

The country experienced some of the hottest temperatures in history last month and a new record of 40.33C was set on January 7.

At least five people died in the fires on mainland Australia and Tasmania and the bushfires also killed thousands of livestock and unknown numbers of kangaroos and other wildlife.
