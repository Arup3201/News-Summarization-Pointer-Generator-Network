A mother whose four-year-old son initially appeared to have drowned in a hotel bathtub last summer has been charged with covering up for her boyfriend who is accused of beating the child to death.

Tania Merisca, 27, and Antonio Durham, 32, are due to be arraigned on Tuesday in Brockton District Court, Mass., in connection with the death of Chauncey Cohen.

The four-year-old was pronounced dead at Good Samaritan Hospital on the night of June 2 after Meriscam, 27, and Durham, 32, claimed they had found him unresponsive in a bathtub at the local Holiday Inn Express, where they had been enjoying a break.

Tania Merisca, 27, of Brockton, Mass., has been charged with covering up for her boyfriend Antonio Durham who is accused of beating her son, Chauncey Cohen, to death last June

An autopsy, however, revealed the boy was killed by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, reports  Boston Herald.

The pair were arrested at separate addresses on Monday after police obtained warrants for their arrest last week.

Durham is charged with murder and Merisca is accused of being an accessory after the fact of the commission of a felony.

At the time of the boy's death, Merisca said she left her son with Durham while she went to work.

When she returned from her shift, she said her son did not feel well and so she decided to give him a warm bath.

Although Merisca has a home in Brockton, she and Durham had been staying at the Holiday Inn as a break from their daily routine.

At the time of Chauncey’s death, she had been seeing Durham for about six months.

Mericsa told Boston.com that while at the hospital with her son, Durham had stepped outside to have a cigarette and not returned.

She said she has never had any involvement with the state’s child protection agency, the Department of Children and Families, and considered herself a good mother for her son.

‘I need to find out what happened to him,’ she said. That way I can sleep good at night. And his family, his father, his grandma, his grandpa know that I did not neglect him or anything.’

She said her son had been a happy child.
