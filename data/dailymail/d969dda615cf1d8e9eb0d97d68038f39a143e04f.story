Footage has emerged of a violent street brawl involving up to a hundred football hooligans after Sunday's Manchester derby.

Some of the thugs used wooden poles as fighting broke out among rival fans under two hours after Manchester City had beaten Manchester United in a Premier League clash.

Violence erupted after a group of trouble-makers stormed the Eastlands Bar, near Manchester City's Etihad stadium, which was still packed with celebrating fans.

United hooligans are then said to have thrown bottles and a flare at rival fans who were drinking on a terrace at the rear of bar.

A number of City supporters ran out of the bar to confront the group, throwing chairs and other missiles.

Video captured by a City fan and posted online appears to show between 70 and 100 supporters punching and kicking each other on Albert Street in the Beswick area of the city.

The footage also captures supporters hurling vile insults. Police say hooligans attacked each other with wooden poles.

The violence left one man, 48, on the ground after it appears he had been punched and kicked in the head.

Police were on the scene moments later and arrested one man they found using a chair as a weapon.

Four others were arrested nearby.

Paramedics were called to the scene but the man who had been felled declined to go to hospital despite a broken nose, cuts and other head injuries.

It is understood none of the people involved in the disturbance has made a complaint of assault.

The five suspects who were arrested have been released on police bail pending further enquiries into the street brawl. 

The five arrested were among eight made by police. Three United fans were also arrested inside the Etihad.

Manchester City won the hotly anticipated game thanks to a second half strike by Sergio Aguero while the match also featured a red card for United's Chris Smalling.

Police had been on alert after a handful of known United hooligans were free to attend the game as their football banning orders had expired.

Before the game, police issued 35 'dispersal orders' to prevent trouble-makers getting to the ground.

Police bosses say the derby passed off relatively peacefully.

A spokesman for GMP confirmed officers attended Stanley Road in Beswick at 4.45pm, some 90 minutes after the final whistle but by then the mob had disappeared.

They confirmed they found a man of 48 with head injuries, although he was conscious. 'He refused ambulance treatment,' said the spokesman
