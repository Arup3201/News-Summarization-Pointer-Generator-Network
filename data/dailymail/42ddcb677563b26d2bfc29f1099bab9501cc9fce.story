Most of us would try to avoid coming face to face with anyone who’d hurt us. So the idea of meeting - and forgiving - your rapist is almost unthinkable.

However this is just what one woman did, five years after she was raped by a 12-year-old pupil in 2004. In 2009, Jo Nodding met her attacker, looked him straight in the eye, and told him she had forgiven him.

Now, five years later, Ms Nodding, a teacher from the north of England is appearing on a BBC3 documentary about the Restorative Justice system, Can Criminals Say Sorry?

Five years after she was raped by a 12-year-old pupil in 2004, Jo Nodding met her attacker, looked him straight in the eye, and told him she had forgiven him

She opens up about her traumatic experience nine years ago which, she says, almost ruined her life entirely: ‘For months and months I didn’t live, I just survived. I didn’t want to go out.

‘For months and months afterwards I could still smell him.

‘If I was out and anybody looked at my personal space, I lost it.

Ms Nodding was teaching the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, at their school when he attacked her.

‘It was a normal Monday morning and we’d been on our own for 10 minutes,’ she explains.

‘He lunged for me. I tried to get him off me, but he was so determined.

‘He raped me quite violently. I thought I was going to die that day.’

The documentary explores the controversial Restorative Justice  system, which invites victims and their attackers to meet, believing this communication can serve as a vital part of rehabilitation for the attacker.

Presented by ex-Eastenders actress Brooke Kinsella, whose brother Ben was stabbed to death six years ago, the programme looks at various cases where the victim has agreed to meet their attacker.

In 2009, Jo Nodding was told by victim liason officer that the boy, now 17, was doing ‘victim empathy work'.

‘I thought, “How can that be possible? How can they know what a victim feels?”’ she says.

‘But I knew I was strong enough and brave enough to go into that meeting.’

The boy had eight months of meetings with Restorative Justice officers before he met with Ms Nodding.

‘He looked like a scared little boy,’ she says in the programme, on BBC3 tonight.

‘It was complete role reversal. He was in control of me the day of the rape and I was petrified of him. Now, he was petrified of me.’

Remarkably, the first thing Ms Nodding said was, ‘thank you for coming to this meeting.’

She described how, when he was raping her, that she saw her family flash before my eyes, such was her conviction that he would strangle her to death.

At this point the boy wept, realising the true impact he had had on Ms Nodding's life.

‘I told him something that not many people will understand,' she continues.

'I told him that I forgive him, and if he hadn’t already forgiven himself, I wanted him to forgive himself because I wanted him to go on and have a successful life.

Ms Noddings went on to explain how, at that moment, she finally felt strong.

'I felt on top of the world,' she says.

‘I hadn’t been myself for five years. I had my life back again.’

Can Criminals Say Sorry? is on BBC3, tonight, 9pm
