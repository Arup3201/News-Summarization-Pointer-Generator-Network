Halloween is always a gamble - there's a fine line between comedy genius and complete social disaster. 

Fortunately for us, despite years and years of practice, there will always be those who never get it quite right. 

Whether it's the parents trying to save a few quid by making the costumes out of bin liners, or the others who try and recycle a Christmas costume, there are plenty of dodgy photos floating around in cyberspace. 

Scroll down for video  

Who drew the short straw here? It's hard to tell. As the country gears up to celebrate Halloween, Femail features some of the most embarrassing attempts at costumes over the years 

In other photo-friendly families, the urge to get a deal on a job lot of matching fancy dress proved too tempting. 

Or there are the mothers and fathers who were tempted to create a real pumpkin costume for their baby as a last minute solution.

Thankfully, those involved have seen the funny side afterwards and many have shared their pictures for others to see. 

We've done a round-up of some of the best from Awkward Family Photos so the rest of the world can share in the laughs.

It's hardly any surprise this baby looks shocked - no matter how long you stare at the picture, you won't be able to decide if this man only wore this costume for Halloween 

Farmyard fun, or is it? None of their smiles reach the eyes 

This man paid a visit to his grandmother before heading on to a Halloween party, he may have borrowed a spare pair of tights in case of laddering too 

Ever wondered what you're going to look like when you grow up? Just take a look at your mother 

When the furniture looks spookier than you, it's a definite Halloween fail 

The woman in the middle might be dressed as a candlestick, but hopefully nobody lit a real match near this lot 

Halloween makes people do some odd things. No wonder the woman at the back is trying to hide  

If you've tried this hard to make your Halloween costumes work, you must've known people would want a photo 

It's hard to tell if the child is crying about the costume or the prospect of being boiled alive 

Credit goes to this woman for going the extra mile with her Halloween photoshoot. Hopefully this was after she returned home from the party, not beforehand 

This mummy costume would definitely have won first prize in the fancy dress competition, if only the child could have got to the venue 

You're never too old for Halloween, although even the man on the TV in the background appears to be questioning the silver bra  

This family didn't hold back on the cost of their costumes, so much so that there was no money left for the child 

You know you've got a strong Halloween costume when you're the focal point in this room 

There will always be one child who is forced to wear the Christmas fancy dress for Halloween 

Nobody could accuse these two of laziness with the outfits 

It doesn't seem like either of these two are up for a night of crime-fighting 

These children were going for the sympathy votes on the trick or treat rounds 

Yep, we're all thinking what you're thinking 

The little girl on the left has every right to be looking that smug 

The floating baby could well be the best Halloween costume of all time 

We're not even really sure if this is Halloween 

Choosing a pumpkin is meant to be fun 

Did they run out of tin foil?
