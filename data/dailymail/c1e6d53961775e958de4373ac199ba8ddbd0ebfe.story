Presenter: Kate Humble has revealed that 'crisps, air and illegal drugs' fuelled her younger days living in London

She’s the wholesome face of many of the BBC’s wildlife shows who seems to thrive on the great outdoors.

But Kate Humble has revealed that ‘crisps, air and illegal drugs’ fuelled her younger days living in London.

While the former host of BBC2’s Springwatch series now lives on an idyllic farm in Wales, she admitted that, aged 19, she lived in a squat.

Speaking ahead of the publication of her latest book, Miss Humble, 44, also defended her decision not to have any children, saying there are far too many humans on the planet already.

Miss Humble said: ‘I don’t miss living in London. It was exciting living in a big city when I was 19, based in a squat and living on crisps, air and illegal drugs.

‘But as I got older I realised I was knackered all the time.

‘Once my TV career started, I’d go away filming to places such as Africa, but at the end of the trip I wouldn’t want to come home back to Chiswick.’

Miss Humble went on to explain her decision not to have a family and attacked journalists for asking why she is childless.

She said: ‘I was never interested in having kids. There are far too many people in the world already.

‘Yet there’s still a deep suspicion in society that a woman should say, “You know what, I never wanted them”. So I have to put up with journalists asking why I haven’t yet had children.

‘Well, how do you know that I haven’t had some sort of dreadful tragedy and I can’t have them?’

Last year Miss Humble revealed she would no longer be part of Springwatch and was replaced by Michaela Strachan.

She has presented Orbit: Earth’s Extraordinary Journey and Lambing Live for the BBC.

In the interview with the Independent On Sunday, Miss Humble said people in Britain ‘do not care about the country’s coastal waters.

She said: ‘For an island nation, we don’t have a proper connection to the sea.

‘We might go for a swim on a July day, should we be feeling brave. But this disconnection means that most people don’t think of the sea as a wildlife habitat.’
