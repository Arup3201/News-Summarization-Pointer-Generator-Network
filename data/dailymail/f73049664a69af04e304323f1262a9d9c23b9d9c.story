A pensioner found dead at home the day after her husband was found slumped at the wheel of his car may have been suffering from a hidden illness it has emerged.

The woman, named locally as 76-year-old Eileen Callaghan, was found dead at the couple’s home in picturesque Haworth, West Yorkshire on Sunday morning, the day after her husband Clement was discovered unconscious following an apparent suicide attempt.

Mr Callaghan, who has been arrested on suspicion of murder, was found on Saturday evening in Keighley Road, Colne, Lancashire, which is a 17-mile drive from their home.

Neighbours said the loving couple, who lived in Ivy Bank Lane, had lived there for more than 40 years and were well known and liked in the area.

Some said they'd heard rumours she had problems with her feet

He was taken to hospital where his condition is described as serious but stable.

A post-mortem examination has taken place but the cause of Mrs Callaghan’s death is still to be established.

Alan Watts, a parish councillor who lives nearby, said: 'It is such a tragedy. I was speaking to someone who said she hadn’t been right well for the past week or two and, whether she had become worse, I don’t know.

'She might have been really poorly and didn’t want to tell anyone,' he said.

One neighbour said: 'It’s just 
unbelievable. I saw him just last week and everything seemed normal, he 
said hello. He was taking his dogs for a walk like he does - clockwork, 
early morning he’d be out with his dogs.

'I’ve heard that Eileen had something 
wrong with her feet and neck. I know she was struggling to walk. At 
first the rumours said it was serious but people who knew them better 
have said it wasn’t serious, that she had a hospital appointment this 
week to look into the problems.'

Steve Thorpe, a gardener, worked with Mr Callaghan on a project to plant flowers and put fencing around the war memorial.

He said: 'I have known him all my life because his wife was born on the same day as my mum, so they grew up together and always knew each other.

'They were not the kind of couple that fell out. They were just a lovely old couple.

'I don’t know whether she was ill but I can’t think of any other reason why this might have happened.'

Mr Thorpe described Mr Callaghan as a village character, who loved his wife and their three collie dogs.

The couple also took other elderly people away on day trips to the Lake District and elsewhere.

Mr Thorpe said: 'Clem goes with a sweeping brush every morning to sweep the memorial. He used to take real pride in it and when Haworth entered Yorkshire In Bloom he came to meet the judges.

'He’s a really firm believer in keeping the cenotaph clean and respecting the soldiers with wreaths and poppies. He’s the sort of person you really want in the village.'

One neighbour said: 'I can’t believe it - they never seemed to have any problems. I think Eileen had been a bit poorly recently, something to do with her feet, so I hadn’t seen her about so much lately.

'But Clem was always out and about, walking his dogs in the morning, tending to his garden.'

Another recalled the banter between the couple at a recent funeral, saying: 'They seemed to have a really good relationship. He was teasing her and she was laughing about it. They were the sort of couple you wouldn’t mind ending up like.

'I know she had been a bit ill, something to do with her feet - but it didn’t seem to be anything life-threatening. She was more private, but still very friendly when you saw her.

'I don’t know what’s happened in that house but I want to believe there’s some good intention behind it, because I can’t imagine what else it could be.'
