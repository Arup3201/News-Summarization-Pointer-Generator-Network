BBC political editor Nick Robinson labelled Russell Brand a 'sanctimonious t***' after the comedian refused to speak to him for a radio show.

The BBC man approached Brand for a comment ahead of a programme he was making about democracy - but was turned down by the self-styled revolutionary, who allegedly called in security guards.

Witnesses to the snubbing have now said Robinson resorted to 'colourful language' when he was denied access to Brand.

The BBC's Nick Robinson was said to have been left furious after Russell Brand refused to speak to him after appearing on Question Time last month

The political journalist sent an angry tweet out soon after the snub, but was said to have used more 'colourful' language after Brand allegedly called in security

The incident happened after Brand's appearance on the BBC's Question Time show, filmed in Canterbury last month.

Robinson is said to have approached Brand and asked for a contribution to his Radio 4 programme, called 'Can Democracy Work?'.

A witness told The Sun that Robinson was left 'clearly furious' after Brand refused to speak and called the comedian a 'sanctimonious t***'.

Shortly after the incident, Robinson tweeted: 'Dear @rustyrockets (Brand's twitter handle), why refusing to be interviewed for @BBCRadio4 'Can Democracy Work?' series? Time for selfies last night but not Qs. Pity'

Neither man had comments on the incident on Twitter this morning.

The first show of Robinson's three-part radio series aired yesterday, in which he criticised Brand's attitude to politics.

It played a recording of Robinson confronting Brand as he posed for selfies with fans, then shouting: 'Why are you so worried about doing an interview about democracy Russell?' as the comedian retreated. 

Following Brand's claims that he wouldn't run parliament because he didn't want to become a politician, Robinson also said: 'In one respect Russell Brand is already like them; he doesn't like answering awkward questions.'

In the programme, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair revealed he has read Brand's book, Revolution, but is unclear how the comedian's ideas could be implemented.

He told Robinson: 'I've studied a lot of what the Russell Brand stuff really means. But I suspect if you implemented that, or tried to implement that, I literally don't know what it means.'  

Robinson has previously attacked Brand's call for people not to vote in elections in his book, Revolution

The BBC has repeatedly invited Brand to talk on Question Time, Newsnight and on numerous Radio shows

Robinson has previously said he is an 'unapologetic believer in elections' after his German Jewish grandparents had to flee both the Nazis and then the Communists in China. 

The 51-year-old told Radio Times that politicians are not all the same and are not all in it for themselves, and 'it does make a difference whether you vote or not and who you vote for'.

He also used the TV listings magazine to attack 39-year-old Brand, who has an estimated fortune of around £9million.

He said: 'Are you listening, Russell Brand, and admirers of the man with the most manicured chest in Britain?

'You see I've got a bit of a beef with Brand. More than anyone I can remember in recent times he has energised, excited and enthused people about some of the great issues of our time.

'And yet Brand continues to tell people that all politics and all politicians are corrupt or venal or a waste of time.

'These days he pretends that he's only ever argued that there's no one worth voting for, but not very long ago he wrote in the New Statesman – 'I will never vote and I don't think you should, either'.'

Brand's recent book Revolution encouraged people not to vote in order to bring about a collapse in government.

He has discussed his views on Newsnight and had a stylist straighten his chest hair before appearing on Question Time.
