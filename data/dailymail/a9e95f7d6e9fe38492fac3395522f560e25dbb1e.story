Afsor Ali, pictured, has been accused in court of keeping terror tutorials on his MP3 player

A Muslim extremist had a library of terror manuals including personal tutorials on Jihad with radical preacher Omar Bakri, the Old Bailey has heard.

Afsor Ali kept a stash of Al Qaeda documents, bomb making plans, and extremist lectures on his computer, selecting some to carry with him on his MP3 player, the court was told.

The 27-year-old also warned of a terrorist attack on the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and called for a Burn American Flag Day in inflammatory YouTube videos, is is said. 

Ali was allegedly the spokesman of banned extremist group Muslims Against Crusades when he praised the 9/11 suicide bomb attacks on America.

Ali was personally counselled by Bakri, the militant cleric dubbed the Tottenham Ayatollah, and recorded two of their conversations about Jihadi fighting and martyrdom.

He is on trial accused of having the Al Qaeda magazine Inspire and terrorist manual ‘39 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad’ on his computers and MP3 player.

Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said Ali was a leader of Muslims Against Crusades and appeared in four YouTube videos under the alias Abu Assadullah promoting extremism.

In one clip, from April 2011, Ali ‘warns the viewer not to attend the Royal Wedding since there’s the risk of an attack by Muslim groups’, he said.

‘He explains to the viewer that the British public have no one to blame except themselves because of the inability to condemn their government.’

Another clip calls for Sharia Law in the UK, while in a third Ali ‘describes 9/11 as a historic event and suggests it has exposed the American ideology to be a fallacy’.

‘He describes the 9/11 atrocity as a blessing and an eye-opener for the American people’, said the prosecutor, of the fourth clip featuring Ali.

His activities were investigated after he was arrested outside the American embassy in London on December 2, 2011, while leading a violent protest against drone strikes in Pakistan.

Police suspect the group of 30 masked men protesting under the name United Ummah and led by Ali were also members of Muslims Against Crusades.

After a violent tussle with police, Ali was arrested and an MP3 player in his pocket was found to contain the Inspire magazine.

The magazine, produced by Al Qaeda, was a special edition produced to celebrate the ‘martyrdom’ of Osama Bin Laden.

Ali’s laptop and hard drive, seized from his home, in east London contained a library of extremist material, including bomb making tips and guides to using AK47s, the court heard.

‘There was also recordings of phone calls this defendant had with Omar Bakri, a radical ideologue and leader of a militant organisation while he was here in the UK’, said Mr Glasgow.

‘The defendant’s voice has been identified by experts, and the defendant accepts it’s him on the phone speaking to Omar Bakri.

‘This defendant and a colleague were seeking advice on the duty of Muslim males to participate in Jihad, and they discussed the requirement of Muslims to travel abroad to fight for Jihad.’

He said Ali is heard saying it ‘would be sinful’ for them not to go abroad to fight.

Ali was picked out at the protest as a leader of the group, shouting angrily at police and leading chanting by the others.

‘He appeared angry and was gesturing and shouting at the police officers’, said Mr Glasgow.

‘He had his fists clenched and he was shouting in anger.

‘When an officer tried to detain another person from within the crowd, the defendant lunged forward and pushed the officers backwards.’

Mr Glasgow said the YouTube videos and computer material was only found after his arrest at the protest.

The Inspire magazine had been transferred from the computer to the MP3 player, then back again, Mr Glasgow said, and was in a folder stored under the name Assadullah..

He told the court: ‘This defendant is likely to claim he has no idea how these files came to be saved on to his electronic devices.

‘He is likely to claim others had access to the hard disk and the MP3 player.

‘He claims anyone could have downloaded these files or it was downloaded accidentally without his knowledge.

‘If he is correct, and he had no idea what was saved on his computer, MP3 player, and external hard disk, you will want to consider with care the background to the offences.

‘If as we suggest is the case, the defendant was the spokesperson for a radical group of extremists, if the defendant was actively seeking advice from an extremist religious cleric on the duty of Muslims to participate in violent Jihad, if the defendant had a keen interest in religious Jihad and the call for violence against the West, you might want to ask yourself how the very information he was interest in was stored on his computer devices without his knowledge.’

Ali of Bethnal Green, east London, denies four counts of possessing documents containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.
