A disabled great-great-grandmother chewed through three layers of duct tape to raise the alarm when burglars broke into her home and threatened to chop off her finger.

Widow Alice Turner, 74, took 20 minutes to chew through the tape around her wrists, after she was attacked by thieves and tied her stairlift at her home in Morecambe, Lancs.

The ordeal began when Mrs Turner, who suffers from asthma and osteoporosis, answered a knock at the door last Friday evening.

Two men pushed their way into the home and told the terrified great-great-grandmother that they would cut off her finger if she didn't say where her money was kept.

They left with around £750 during the attack, including a box of 50 pence pieces that the pensioner had been saving for her great-great grandson.

A new handbag, that Mrs Turner had bought after her last one was stolen from her car, was also taken in the burglary.

She said: 'These two fellas barged their way in and pushed me on the stairs.

'I started shouting for my neighbours but they had gone out.

'One of them put his hand over my mouth and said: ‘Stop shouting’ and ‘Where’s your money? Where’s your money?’

'I said I hadn’t got any and he said: ‘We know you have’. Then his friend grabbed my arm and duct-taped my arms to the stair lift.

'They said if I didn’t tell them where my money was they would cut my finger off - that’s where it got scary.'

She added: 'I thought: ‘Are they going to kill me?’

'They were going to tape my mouth and I said I wouldn’t have been able to breathe. They kept shouting: ‘Just calm down and look at the wall’.

'When they left I bit through the duct tape. I saw one bit I thought was the end of the tape and got gnawing at it.'

Mrs Turner, who lost her husband Albert in 1994, was badly shaken by the incident and was left with bruises on her arms and wrists.

The former barmaid said: 'I keep breaking down and crying. I’m not sleeping properly and I’m having chest pains.

'I have fought lung cancer and beat that and had a broken back - I’m not ready to die yet.'

Mrs Turner's son David, 49, has now moved in with his mother to look after her.

He said: 'Everyone who knows mum will know she’s a tough lady and always has been.

'Anyone more frail would have found this harder to come to terms with. They are cruel, cowardly, heartless scum, picking on a defenceless woman.

'I would appeal to anyone who knows anything or might have information to please get in touch with police, who are so far doing an excellent job.'

Detective Inspector Andy Bunn, from Lancashire Police, said: 'This was a most despicable attack on a vulnerable and defenceless elderly woman.

'The level of violence used was completely unnecessary.'
