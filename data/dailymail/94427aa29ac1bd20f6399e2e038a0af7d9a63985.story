Her cancer battle is now over as she underwent two operations and 16 chemotherapy sessions.

She wrote: 'New challenge. Goodbye hair, smiling and continue and learning from the hand of love. I will not weaken, after all, faith and love remain.'

In one picture of her bare head and shoulders,  she looks straight into the camera, with the caption: 'The one who dresses too much on the outside is nude on the inside.'

Lorena is popular for her roles in shows including Escandalo (Scandal) and Pasion de Gavilanes (Hawk Passion), which is made in Venezuela where she is also well known.

But now the brave TV beauty has now also become a symbol for other women battling in particular against breast cancer but also other forms of cancer, and has urged them not to lose faith as they lose their looks.

She said cancer was just a temporary stage in her life, adding it had been wonderful to have the opportunity of experiencing the miracle of life and that she was grateful it was still going on and she could continue loving and learning.

And she added: 'I know that the images of myself undergoing treatment are shocking, but I also want to raise awareness of breast cancer and to encourage other people to make sure they look out for signs of it in themselves.'

She currently lives in Colombia with her boyfriend and fellow actor who has been supporting her through the ordeal.
