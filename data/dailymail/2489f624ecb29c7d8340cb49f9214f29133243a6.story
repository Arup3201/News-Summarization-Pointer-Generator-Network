A devastated son whose father was beheaded and his mother abducted a week ago today said he now hopes she is dead to ‘ease her suffering’ as it is too unbearable to think of her in pain.

Retired Russell Dermond’s decapitated body was found at his exclusive, lake-front home last Tuesday, but his wife of 62 years Shirley has vanished, in a suspected kidnapping.

Investigators in Putnam County, Georgia are completely baffled by the gruesome crime and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved elderly couple.

Nothing was taken from their $1m home, their car keys and cellphones were left behind.

Unspeakable: Shirley Dermond, 87, has not been seen for more than a week after her husband's decapitated body was found at their home. Their son, Keith, said: 'If she is still alive, we can’t imagine 
what she is going through… but it
 has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just 
to ease her suffering'

Mystery: No-one has been able to think of why anyone would want to harm Shirley and Russell. Nothing was taken, their cellphones and car keys were left behind. Police have ruled out a mob hit and that Russell was in witness protection. And their family they can't believe it is linked to the drug murder of son, Mark, in 2000

The police have been forced to deny they were taken out in a mob hit and their despairing family have also denied their is any link between the horror and the killing of one of the couple's son's in a drug deal gone wrong.

Officers have been dredging a nearby lake and searching woods for clues, but as yet the local Sheriff says they have no leads. They still haven’t found 88-year-old Mr Dermond’s severed head.

One of the Dermond’s three heartbroken children, Keith said the family had been wracking their brains to try to come up with any possible motive, but they say their parents didn’t have a single enemy in the world.

He is still desperate for the safe return of his 87-year-old mother, but the idea of her suffering at the hands of a, ‘sick’ murderer is just too much for him to bear.

Speaking to MailOnline, Keith, 55, from Jacksonville, Florida, said: ‘We are completely devastated, but our primary focus is finding our mother. The thought of her suffering is just unbearable. 

‘Each hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never know what happened.

‘If she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering.

‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’

Sick: Keith, pictured center left with wife Kathleen and other family members, said: 'The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them.' He added it could have been the work of a cult

Russell Dermond was last seen May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta.

Shirley Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox.  That same day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s Kentucky Derby party.

According to Putnam County Sheriff, Howard Sills, financial and phone records have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target of criminal activity.

Since the murder speculation about a potential motive has been rife. Sheriff Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have been killed by mobsters.

He has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone wrong in 2000.

Mark was gunned down in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. 

He was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied.

And Keith says that while his brother Brad, his sister Leslie and him have considered a possible link between their brother’s slaying and their father’s murder, It just doesn’t make sense.

Isolated: Keith reckons they may have been targeted not because of their wealth - as they have richer neighbors either side, but because they live at the end of a cul-de-sac with no other houses that close

Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman

He said: ‘People have tried to link this to my brother’s murder. We have obviously thought about that, because it is a violent connection to my parents, but that doesn’t make sense either.

‘The individual is still in jail and anyway, my parents weren’t really involved in the case at the time. They didn’t attend court, so if this was some kind of revenge, they would not be obvious targets.

‘It is a complete mystery as far as we are concerned. We have been wracking our brains trying to think of anyone who may have wanted to do this, but we have no idea. 

‘My father hadn’t been in business for 20 years. He just spent his time relaxing and playing golf. He just didn’t have any enemies.

‘The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them. 

‘My parents live at the end of a cul-de-sac, so they have no neighbors either side. Maybe that’s why they were targeted? 

‘It could have been anything, something to do with a cult, we just don’t know. There were definitely people in that neighborhood who would be more obvious targets if it was a robbery.

My parents were comfortable, but they definitely weren’t wealthy.’

Keith and his siblings initially flew to Georgia to try to help with the investigation, but they have not been allowed in the house - where many happy family parties were held over the years - because it is still a crime scene.

Now they have returned home where they are playing an unbearable waiting game, desperately hoping for news about their mother one way or the other.  

And heartbreakingly, Sheriff Howard Sills has said he is not optimistic she’ll be found alive.

Speaking on Tuesday, he said: ‘I’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty.’

There was speculation that an elderly woman who turned up dazed and confused Monday at a Tampa hospital was Shirley Dermond, but that has been completely dismissed.

Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party

And Sills said rumors of organized crime involvement are unfounded. He said: ‘No, the man wasn’t in witness protection. He wasn’t going to testify. There’s no evidence of any kind of torture.’

On Tuesday, they enlisted the aid of a Department of Natural Resources submarine robot to scour the deep peninsula off Lake Oconee outside the couple’s home. So far, they’ve turned up nothing.

Sills said he had also dispatched deputies to a wooded area near the crime scene in the hope they would discover some kind of clue.

Keith – who like his late father, manages a chain of restaurants - said: ‘The Sheriff is keeping us informed as much as he can. I spoke to him yesterday. He is holding back some information as it is important to the case.

‘The house is still a crime scene, they are looking for finger prints and dredging the lake, but there just doesn’t seem to be much in terms of leads.’

He added: ‘My parents were married for 62 years. Family was everything to them. Their happiest times were spent with us, that’s what they loved doing. We just pray someone who knows something comes forward and puts an end to all of this.’
