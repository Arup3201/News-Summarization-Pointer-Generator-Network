The world's largest-selling brand of cigarette is under fire for allegedly encouraging teenagers to smoke.

Marlboro, which is owned by Philip Morris International (PMI), is accused of targeting youngsters across the globe through its 'Don't Be A Maybe' campaign.

Each advert in the campaign features young people - with some pictured partying, snowboarding and playing the guitar.

Criticised: Each advert in the campaign features young people - with some pictured playing music (above)

One poster includes a young couple kissing as they rest against a wall - with the caption reading: 'Maybe never fell in love'.

Another features a woman gazing at the orange sky over a city from the top of a building, stating: 'A maybe never reached the top'.

Other adverts see young people travelling, jumping over a fence and even crowd surfing at a gig.

The posters - which have been introduced across more than 50 countries - all end with the command: 'Be Marlboro'.

Risk-taking: Other adverts see young people travelling, jumping over a fence and even crowd surfing at a gig

Now, international public health bodies have accused PMI of 'drawing on youth-oriented images and themes that suggest to young people that they should BE a Marlboro smoker'.

In a report,
 the organisations state that PMI is 'breaching its ethical code' by 
using themes of freedom, risk-taking and falling in love to encourage 
teenagers to take up smoking.

'Philip
 Morris International claims it doesn't market to kids, but the evidence
 in this report shows otherwise,' said Matthew L. Myers, president of 
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

But Marlboro has denied targeting teenagers - and claims its campaign is 'aimed exclusively at adult smokers'.

Allegations: International public health bodies have accused PMI of 'drawing on youth-oriented images and themes that suggest to young people that they should BE a Marlboro smoker'. Above, a man jumps over a fence

'A maybe is not invited': One advertisement in France includes a young man posing in a hat and jack

The report, titled 'You're the Target', was issued by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Alliance for the Control of Tobacco Use Brazil, Corporate Accountability
 International, Framework Convention Alliance, InterAmerican Heart 
Foundation, and Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance.

It
 calls on governments worldwide to enforce 'comprehensive bans' on 
tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship that appeal to teenagers. 

Since its launch, the 'Don't be a Maybe'
 campaign has seen the introduction of advertisements, billboards, and 
other promotional events, such as music concerts, beach tours and 
interactive booths, in countries across the world.

Action: In a report, the organisations state that PMI is 'breaching its ethical code' by using themes of freedom, risk-taking and falling in love to encourage teenagers to take up smoking. Above, a promotional event

Denial: Marlboro denied targeting teenagers - claiming its campaign was 'aimed exclusively at adult smokers'

However, it was banned in Germany in October last year for targeting teenagers as young as 14 - while similar complaints have been generated elsewhere.

Today, PMI spokesman, Iro Antoniadoum, told MailOnline the campaign was 'conducted in compliance with local regulations and internal marketing policies'.

'Allegations to the contrary are unfounded and based on a subjective interpretation,' the spokesman wrote in an email.

'Complete bans or restrictive regulation limiting tobacco advertising are common in both developed and developing countries around the world today.

Snowboarding: Every day, 80,000 to 100,000 young people around the world become addicted to tobacco

'In those places where marketing and advertising is permitted, our campaigns are
intended to inform current consumers of our brands in their choice and
encourage smokers of competing brands to switch to our products.'

Every day, a staggering 80,000 to 100,000 young people around the world become addicted to tobacco, according to the report.

The substance is the worldâ€™s leading cause of preventable death - killing nearly six million people worldwide each year.

Alarmingly, it is predicted to kill one billion people this century if current trends continue.
