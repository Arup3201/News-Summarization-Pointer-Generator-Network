Danny Welbeck hasn't felt any lasting effects of the  knock which saw him limp out of England's win in Estonia and will train with Arsenal on Tuesday.

The 23-year-old was substituted after rolling his ankle during the Euro 2016 qualifier in Tallinn. 

But Welbeck hasn't done any damage and is fit and ready to face Hull City at the weekend.

The news will come as a relief to Arsene Wenger, who has been managing a lengthy injury list at the Emirates this season.

That now appears to be subsiding after pictures of Theo Walcott training at London Colney on Monday, with Olivier Giroud also closing in on a return.   

Aaron Ramsey and Mesut Ozil are both still missing - as well as Mathieu Debuchy - but Wenger has reason for cheer.  

Roy Hodgson had played down the extent of Welbeck's knock immediately after the game. 'I don't think he's injured. He just rolled his ankle slightly. The doctors are not worried about it,' he said. 

The former Manchester United forward arrived at the Emirates in a £16million move on deadline day and, despite the fears of some Arsenal supporters, has impressed with four goals - including a hat-trick in the Champions League against Galatasaray.

Welbeck has also been scoring freely for England since leaving Old Trafford, netting a brace against Switzerland and another strike against San Marino before Sunday's game that saw England maintain their 100 per cent record.
