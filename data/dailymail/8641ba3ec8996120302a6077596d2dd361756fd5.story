The British soldier killed in Afghanistan had been selected for promotion before he was shot dead in Helmand province.

Lance Corporal James Brynin, of the Intelligence Corps, was killed when he patrol was attacked in the area of Kakaran, north east of Lashkar Gah, the Ministry of Defence has said.

Despite receiving immediate medical attention, 22-year-old L/Cpl Brynin, known as Jay, died from his injuries at the scene.

Due for promotion: Lance Corporal James Brynin of the Intelligence Corps had been selected for promotion before he was killed in Afghanistan

His death takes the number of UK service members who have lost their lives since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 445.

It is the first UK death in Afghanistan since Corporal William Savage, Fusilier Samuel Flint, and Private Robert Hetherington died when their Mastiff armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device on April 30.

Paying tribute to L/Cpl Brynin, the MoD said that he had excelled in the army, had already been selected for promotion to corporal and had 'grand ambitions'.

Born in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, L/Cpl Brynin joined the army in February 2011.

After his initial training he was posted to 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare) and had already served a tour in Afghanistan in 2012.

L/Cpl Bryinon returned to Afghanistan this August as an intelligence analyst working for a light electronic warfare team within the Brigade Reconnaissance Force, BRF, of 7th Armoured Brigade.

In the early hours of yesterday, the BRF deployed from Camp Bastion into Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand Province to counter an 'imminent threat' to both Afghans and Isaf, International Security Assistance Force, personnel, the MoD said.

Towards the end of the operation, the section came under fire.

Together with a sniper and machine-gunner of the BRF, L/Cpl Brynin returned fire but suffered a fatal gunshot wound.

Paying tribute to the soldier, L/Cpl Brynin's family said: 'Heart of a lion, we will always stand strong for you. We will never forget. Rest in peace - dad Efrem, mum Sharon, sister Yasmin and girlfriend Olivia.'

Tributes also poured in from colleagues, including a poem written by Corporal Ashley Roylance, Intelligence Corps, 236 Signal Squadron, 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare).

Comrades described how the Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club fan aspired to 'P Company' - selection for the Parachute Regiment - on his return from Afghanistan.

Lieutenant Colonel Mark Purves, Royal Signals, Commanding Officer 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), said: 'Bright and engaging, Lance Corporal Brynin was immensely popular and an outstanding soldier in every respect.

'Having already completed one tour to Afghanistan, his appointment to support the Brigade Reconnaissance Force was indicative of his talent and leadership qualities.

'He was fit, determined and genuinely wanted to make a difference. His selection for promotion to full Corporal earlier this year highlighted his flair for his chosen profession.'

He went on: 'A member of a small and 
specialist cadre, his selfless sacrifice to those around him typifies 
his commitment and unflinching bravery.

Tribute: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was 'saddened' to hear of L/Cpl Brynin's death

'He will, forever, be remembered with pride by his regimental family. Our thoughts and prayers are with Jay's parents, his close family and friends at this difficult time.'

Lieutenant Colonel Richard Slack MBE, Commanding Officer 9th/12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales's), the Brigade Reconnaissance Regiment, described L/Cpl Brynin as 'a star, burning bright and rising fast' and a 'truly special individual'.

He said: 'His loss is one of the real tragedies of this military campaign.'

Major Tom McDermott, Royal Tank Regiment, Officer Commanding the Brigade Reconnaissance Force, also paid tribute to the young soldier.

He said: 'Lance Corporal Jay Brynin was one of the great characters of this world.

'From the first moment I met him I was won over by his ever-present smile, his great sense of humour and his ability to get on with everyone and anyone he met.

'He loved his job and the small team he worked with, and they loved him back.

'We will always remember him for his keen intelligence, his determination to succeed, and his zest for life.

'Our deepest condolences are with his parents and his girlfriend.'

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said that he was saddened to learn of the tragic death.

'His colleagues and commanders have spoken warmly about his outstanding professionalism and selflessness,' said Mr Hammond.

'It is clear that he was a man of determination, ambition and high achievement.

'My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with his family, friends and colleagues at this most difficult time.'
