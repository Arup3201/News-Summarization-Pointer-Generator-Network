Designers have come up with a bright idea - adding LED bulbs to paddles for night sports.

US company Torch Paddles spent a year developing the idea, aimed at increasing sports and exploration after sunset.

Bright spark David Swanson, designer of the paddles, revealed the paddles take longer to produce due to the technology.

Whether it's to paddle board competitively, or simply for exploration purposes, the LEDs bring another dimension to adventure

But they are already planning on growing the line of products by adding LEDs to SUP and canoe paddles.

He said: 'Paddling helps you find the thing that you treasure, whether that's personal fitness, social bonding or bonding with nature.

'Getting out on the water after work, when the sun is dipping and the atmosphere is perfect, it's mesmerising how the water appears when it's lit up from below.

The paddles are easy to use; an on/off button is located on the handle that can transform your night boarding to something more exciting

As well as enhancing night-time viewing, the paddles can provide that bit more safety as others will be able to easily know where you are

The LED paddles are currently retailing at around £150, and more designs are being planned for a variety of scenarios

'Once you do it - you're hooked.'

Faceted angles define the face of the blade; channeled to protect the LEDs and chisled to provide strength. 

Lights shine on just one side of the blade; lighting up everything you want to see in front of you, without blinding you or those behind you. 

The designer paddles allow the user to be the envy of those who you paddle past with a paddle that's built to light up your night.

The paddles are currently on special offer sale of $232 (Around £150). 

With the only light coming from the paddles and the moon, a different scene to that during the day can be discovered
