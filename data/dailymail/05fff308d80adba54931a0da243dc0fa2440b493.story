These shocking images reveal the violence that is blighting railway stations in Australia's largest city.

As politicians warned that cutbacks are leading to decreased security at Sydney's stations, CCTV footage captures a number of vicious attacks.

A group of teenage girls can be seen violently beating a couple at Blacktown station in one clip. The assault is so severe that the male is left unconscious, while the female's face is covered in blood.

Brutal: An incident at Cabramatta station shows a man being repeatedly kicked on the floor by a group of young men and women

Help: The attack is only stopped when police officers arrive wielding taser guns

During another incident at Cabramatta station, a man is repeatedly kicked on the floor by a group of young men and women as powerless guards struggle to intervene.

Police officers eventually arrived at the scene, pointing taser guns at the attackers in an attempt to stop them attacking the victim.

Statistics from the Bureau of Crime reveal that there are three attacks every day at train stations in Sydney.

Opposition transport minister Penny Sharpe said cutbacks were having an effect due to a reduction in the number of guards manning stations.

She said that no officers were on duty after midnight between Sunday and Wednesday.

She added: 'These are serious incidents and people's lives are ruined as a result of them.

'Three attacks a day is three attacks too many. There are fewer people patrolling the trains then there ever have been before.'

Tim Thornton suffered a fractured skull, bleeding on the brain and lost the hearing in his right ear after an attack.

He told Nine News: 'I was pretty much knocked out from as soon as he hit me and i think my head hit the ground. I didn't remember what happened for the next three days.'
