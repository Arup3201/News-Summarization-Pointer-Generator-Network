A female self-made billionaire has vowed to fight civil fraud charges lodged against her by the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims she wrongly claimed more than $200 million in fees suggesting it was a battle between 'good and evil'. 

Wall Street executive Lynn Tilton, 55, of Patriarch Partnership is accused of hiding poorly performing investments among some of her dealings with distressed companies. 

The high-profile investor seeks out companies facing financial problems and attempts to turn them into profitable businesses.

However, the SEC believes that Ms Tilton failed to adequately tell people who invested more than $2.5 billion in some of her companies that they continued to face financial difficulties. 

The SEC said alleged fraud has continued since 2003.  

The SEC's decision to prosecute Tilton is seen as an attempt by government regulators to impose standards on Wall Street. 

President Obama has recently announced tougher restrictions on brokers who advise Americans over their retirement accounts. 

The SEC claims that Tilton failed her legal duty to clients to warn that some of the companies she had invested their money in were performing worse than expected. 

In its filing to a New York court the SEC said that Tilton 'intentionally and consistently directed' that the value of the assets remained unchanged even though they were worth less. 

The court documents said that three of the funds had under performed and Tilton had failed to pass this information on to her clients. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission claims that Tilton, second right, failed to properly inform her clients that some of the investment products had not been performing as well as they had anticipated 

Tilton's company dismissed the allegations claiming that the SEC action was 'ill-founded and at odds with Patriarch's investment strategy, which was consistently disclosed since the inception of the funds.

'We look forward to the opportunity to vigorously defend ourselves against the SEC's allegations.' 

Tilton told CNBC that despite the SEC's case against her, she will continue to run more than 70 companies in her portfolio. 

She said: 'I am shocked. I am disappointed, saddened and ... I am certain that the allegations are ill-founded.'

She said the case was 'the ultimate battle in good against evil, light against dark.' 

She added: 'My number one priority is protecting my company and my people so that I can maximize the value of the funds. My people need to know that I am fighting for them. I also want to live in a country where I can fight for truth without assuming that because it's the government that I am guilty without the battle. As someone who has always fought for truth, and protected her integrity and her intent, and have prevailed, I expect to do that.' 

Tilton claimed that her business model of investing in distressed companies does involve some failures,although she described her backers as 'sophisticated investors'.
