A young family’s rented home in Florida has become infested with snakes in recent months and nothing their landlord does seems to work.

Alissa Scott and her fiancée, Raymond Hisler, say the Punta Gorda property which they rent has had the reptile problem for the past three months.

To date, they've have caught 48 of the small, but vicious snakes and pest control has visited the property three times.

Not only is the infestation driving them up the wall, but they are also concerned for the safety of their  two-year-old son Bentley.

‘Our two-year-old is terrified of them, and we've only found one or two in his bedroom, so far. Thank god,’ Hisler told WTOC.

The couple renting the home from Barnes and Phillips Real Estate, who’ve sent pest control out three times.

The first time they only checked outside, but by the third visit the exterminators had laid traps inside the home.

Despite trapping 48 snakes, the family say they are still finding more serpents and now they’re upset with the not so helpful advice which their realtor has passed on.

‘They're telling us that we just need to let the snakes run their course. It's just not acceptable. We can't do that. We can't live like that,’ Scott said.

Barnes and Phillips Real Estate claim they are doing everything they can about the snakes, but the young couple are growing tired of the problem.

‘It’s devastating because we come home and the first thing we do is check [for] snakes,’ Scott said. ‘We can’t do it anymore.’
