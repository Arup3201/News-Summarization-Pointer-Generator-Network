The sudden collapse of the third floor in a DC strip club Friday afternoon sent people jumping out of windows in an effort to escape the rubble.

Employees of The Cloakroom, a gentleman's club located in the adult entertainment district of Washington, DC, were forced to put on their clothes and leave when a building adjacent to the club began to crumble at approximately 3:30pm.

Firefighters and EMS react as the building next to Cloakroom collapses. The inside of the Washington, DC building collapsed at 3:30pm Friday afternoon, with the the exterior crumbling at 4pm

Occupants of the building, including the eight dancers scheduled to perform from noon until 7pm that evening, were told to evacuate the building. An eyewitness at the scene saw people jumping from second-story windows at the club.

By 4pm, the exterior of the adjacent building collapsed, dropping rubble onto the sidewalk below. According to a photo provided to MailOnline, five dancers are pictured having already evacuated the building.

According to the DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services' Twitter, one person was transported from the scene with minor injuries.

'[We were] just dancing, doing our routine ... and the wall collapsed in
 on the kitchen and the bathroom ... some of the girls were shaken up,' 
Olivia, a dancer at The Cloakroom, told News4 about the initial collapse.

The collapse began with the interior of the buildings, a row of four on the same block. In addition to the gentleman's club, the block included a nail salon and two other buildings that appeared to be for-sale or under construction.

The cause for the collapse is still unknown. Prior to the second collapse, a K9 unit searched the building for any survivors buried in the rubble, finding none.
