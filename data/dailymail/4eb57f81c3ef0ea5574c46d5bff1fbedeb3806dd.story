President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama are set to make their first joint appearance together next week at an event in Washington.

Organizers of the National Prayer Breakfast told Time that the Tibetan spiritual leader will attend, but he will not give a speech. 

The White House said Wednesday that it was not yet sure of Obama's plans. The president's spokesman said he 'would be surprised' if he didn't go to the Feb. 5 affair, however. Obama appeared at the gathering every year since taking office.

While the president and the Dalai Lama have never shared a public stage together before, Obama has hosted him at the White House during three previous visits.

On every occasion, the U.S. government has been careful not to extend to the exiled leader the same courtesies it does heads of state lest it offend the Chinese government, which contends that the Dalai Lama is a 'wolf in sheep's clothing.' 

Typically, the presidents meets with foreign leaders in the Oval Office. When the Dalai Lama visits, the Obama takes him in the less prestigious Map Room. No U.S. president has ever held talks with His Holiness in the Oval, the White House has said.

After a 2010 meeting the Dalai Lama was infamously photographed by reporters as he was escorted out a side door of the White House past bags of trash that hadn't yet been retrieved due to a snowstorm.

The Chinese government routinely punishes heads of state who appear too cozy with the Dalai Lama, who has been living in exile in India since 1959.

The country suspended high-level diplomatic ties with Great Britain in 2012 after England's prime minister and deputy prime minister visited with His Holiness during a London visit.

China gave Germany the cold shoulder in 2007 after the country's chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave the Dalai Lama an audience.

In 2008 China cancelled a European Union summit after France's president, also the head of the EU at the time, held court with the Nobel laureate.

Norwegian officials avoided the Dalai Lama when he came to the country earlier this year to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his Nobel Prize award.

The U.S. has not experienced the same backlash as its European allies for repeatedly accommodating the spiritual leader. 

It has been on the receiving end of sharp rebukes from the country's government for the 'gross interference in China's internal affairs,' however, and what China has called 'a serious violation of the norms of international relations.'

'The Dalai is definitely not a pure religious figure. He is using the cloak of religion to engage in long-term activities to separate China. He is a political exile,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement before a February 2014 meeting between he and Obama. 

The spiritual icon contends that he is not seeking independence for his native region, and is not a threat to China's sovereignty.

The White House said after his most recent sit-down with the president that he expressed hope 'that dialogue between his representatives and the Chinese government will resume.'

Obama, like his predecessors, has routinely made it clear that the U.S. believes its up to China and the people of Tibet to resolve their differences. 

'We are not in favor of independence for Tibet,' he said at a joint press conference in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping in November.

Obama said he did 'encourage Chinese authorities to take steps to preserve the unique cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people,' during the talks, though.
