Inter Milan are stepping up their interest in want-away Arsenal forward Joel Campbell.

The Serie A club have held initial talks with the Costa Rica international's representatives about a potential £5million January move.

Inter - and Benfica - tried to sign him in the summer, but Arsene Wenger wanted to keep Campbell after Olivier Giroud's ankle injury left the club short of attacking options.

But Campbell looks likely to leave Arsenal in one of the next two transfer windows after failing to convince Wenger that he has a long-term future at the Emirates Stadium.

The 22-year-old, who shot to global prominence following his displays in the World Cup, is happy to leave Arsenal knowing he is unlikely to play regularly.

He has made just one start in the Capital One Cup and hasn't featured in the first-team squad for the past three games.

But he has found first-team opportunities limited at Arsenal this season and wants to move on

The lack of first-team opportunities have frustrated Campbell, who now believes it is best he leaves.
