Few things are worse than a back seat driver; unless the back seat driver happens to be your mother  and she is in the front seat sitting next to you.

Josh Pray, 29, a comedian from Florida, has uploaded hilarious video footage of him driving his mother about in a car.

Unfortunately for Josh, his mum takes issue with every decision he makes on the road.  

Josh Pray, 29,  has uploaded hilarious video footage of him driving his demanding mother about in a car

From criticising his taste in music to demanding he make a detour for some Popeye's chicken, she has something to say at every turn. 

She scolds him for not being aware of his surroundings: 'There's a lot of stuff going down on this highway, you need to be more focused on the road. Young people shouldn't be driving like that.'

Next, his speed appears to be the problem.

'Slow this car down! Slow this car down,' she says. 

Josh answers: 'Mum, I'm going 13'. 

She asks him to pull over at one point so she can have a look at something and challenges his music taste

She asks him to pull over at one point so she can have a look at something and also points out a better route that he could be going. 

When she catches her son picking his nose, she looks horrified then loudly lets him know her disapproval.

On his website, Josh Pray lists Martin Lawerence, Benji Brown, and Jim Varney as comics who inspire him

Josh puts on some music which she quickly turns off, telling him, 'No, no, no. You need some gospel music in here.'

At the end Josh's mother leaves the car and chides him for not taking her to any of the places she wanted to go while he looks despairingly at the camera. 

On his website Josh lists Martin Lawrence, Benji Brown, and Jim Varney as comics who inspire him. 'I hope to follow in their footsteps soon,' he says.
