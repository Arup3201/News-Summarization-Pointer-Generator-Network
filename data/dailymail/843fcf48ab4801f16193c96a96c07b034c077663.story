Ryan Gosling won the hearts of women worldwide back in 2004 when he played lovestruck teen Noah in The 
Notebook and has kept us enthralled ever since, earning himself a reputation as one of Hollywood's biggest heartthrobs.

But one beauty blogger has accused the actor of having a little helping hand in the looks department in the form of a nose job. Hey girl, prepare for a lot of hate mail.

Beauty blogger Michelle Villett has accused Gosling of having gone under the knife to 
straighten, thin and refine his nose on beauty website Beautyeditor.ca.

Surely not? His good looks may have won over the world's females, but one beauty blogger thinks Ryan Gosling has had some help from surgery

Analysing photos of the Canadian taken over the years, Villet observes: 'Do you think his nose is a little thinner, shorter, straighter and less projecting now?'.

Comparing photos from his Mickey Mouse club days in the late 90s to shots from 2007, she muses: 'The bridge looks straighter, so it’s 
possible that he may have already had the “work” done by this point. Or 
had repeat nose jobs.'

Using present day photos to illustrate her point, she concludes: 'I say it’s straighter, the tip has been removed and the nostrils have been refined - but we’re talking tiny, tiny. To me, his nose clearly looks quite different compared to the early days.'

Has he or hasn't he? Villet uses photos of Gosling back in 2001, aged 21, (L) and compares them to today (R) to ponder over his possible rhinoplasty

So is Villet alone in her thoughts?

Celebrity plastic surgeon Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD at 111 Harley Street, said: 'Although subtle, in my opinion, it’s clear from these images that there have been number of changes made to Ryan’s nose.

'Rhinoplasty is one of the most common surgical procedures carried out at my Harley St clinic and during an initial consultation I always advise patients that any alterations to their nose should not only resemble the original but should complement existing facial features.

'Even though my patients have differing concerns, almost all request minor alterations as they don’t want to dramatically change their appearance. This is also evident in Ryan’s images.

Comparisons: Blogger Michelle Villet wrote the article on Beauty Editor and used several old and new photos of Gosling to illustrate her point

'In Ryan’s case, his nose at the beginning of his career is significantly wider at the bridge and has a prominent hump. Fast forward ten years and both of these features appear altered. 

'Although rhinoplasty is a relatively simple procedure a result like this will have taken several steps to achieve.

'Firstly, the nasal tip has been slightly rotated upwards and reduced in size by the removal of cartilage. In addition, the bridge has been lowered and made narrower to remove the slight hump, creating a straight, symmetrical look.'

Helpless Ryan isn't the only star that Villet has accused of surgery.

She has also posted photos of stars such as Emma Watson, Megan Fox and Blake Lively to determine if they’ve also had rhinoplasties, injections or any other procedures.
