A 20-year-old woman who suffered a heart attack during breast enhancement surgery says she feels grateful to be alive and she 'loves' her new chest.

Amy Rickhuss went into cardiac arrest halfway through her breast augmentation at The Cosmetic Institute at Parramatta in Western Sydney on Friday morning.

Surgeons had to use a defibrillator to correct her heart rhythm and completed her cosmetic surgery before she was rushed to hospital in a serious condition.

Now recovering in hospital, Ms Rickhuss says she feels lucky the surgical team saved her life but that she would never go under the knife again.

'The only thing I ever wanted was to have my boobs and I've got them - I should be grateful for them now,' she told The Project.

'I'm lucky to be here, I'm lucky to be alive.

'I don't plan on having any more cosmetic surgery.' 

In an interview with Kyle and Jackie O, Ms Rickhuss said she was very pleased with the results of the surgery.

'I actually really love them,' she said.

'I was originally really small, I think I was about a 10A.

'I have no idea [what cup size they are now]… but they're nice if that's what you want to know.'

Ms Rickhuss said she had 450cc implants put in, which in most cases increases cup size from A to D.

'The only thing I ever wanted was to have my boobs and I've got them - I should be grateful,' she said 

She remains in hospital where she is undergoing a range of tests to work out the cause of her heart irregularity

Ms Rickhuss said she was very pleased with the results of the surgery. She had her 10A breasts increased to about a D cup

Doctors are not sure what caused her heart to start beating irregularly, but they believe Ms Rickhuss may have either suffered an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic or may suffer from an underlying heart condition.

She remains in hospital where she is undergoing a range of tests to work out the cause of the problem before she is released. 

As Ms Rickhuss recovered in hospital on Saturday, she told Daily Mail Australia  she was overwhelmed with the support she's had from family, friends and doctors from the clinic.

Ms Rickhuss, who's originally from Victoria but is based in Perth for her fly-in fly-out job at a mine site, travelled to Sydney for the medical procedure.

'It's something I've been planning on doing for a while for my own personal reasons,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I did my research when deciding where to go and chose The Cosmetic Institute because of their excellent reputation, as well as their affordability. I also looked at going overseas but chose to stay here in Australia, and thank God I did.'

When Ms Rickhuss woke up at Westmead Hospital confused, she says her plastic surgeon Dr Niro Sivathasan was there to explain what had happened.

'Dr Niro was with me all the way and came and visited me in the hospital,' she said.

'The personal care and attention I have received from Dr Niro, as well as the fact that he literally saved my life, has proved that I made the right choice when selecting him as my surgeon. I could not be more grateful.'

Ms Rickhuss also reached out to the clinic on Facebook and wrote: 'The Cosmetic Institute and Dr Niro saved my life. Me and my boobs are going to be fine.'

The 20-year-old also thanked everyone in a Facebook post, saying she was shedding 'happy tears' and felt 'blessed' to have such support from those around her. 

'So overwhelmed with the TCI's support and most of all my family,' she wrote.

Ms Rickhuss was undergoing surgery at The Cosmetic Institute at Parramatta in western Sydney yesterday when she fell unconscious and went into cardiac arrest, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The woman was stabilised by the anaesthetist as doctors went on to finish up the procedure as part of the clinic's 'strict protocol', managing director David Segal told Daily Mail Australia.

She was then taken to hospital in a serious condition but is now in full recovery.

Paramedics responded at about 10.15am on Friday to reports Ms Rickhuss had suffered cardiac arrest, had fallen unconscious and wasn't breathing.

Staff at the clinic reportedly performed CPR on the patient and used a defibrillator before paramedics arrived.

Mr Segal said the new patient was believed to have had a reaction to the anaesthetic.

He said the incident occurred halfway through the one hour surgery.

'The onsite anaesthetist was able to revert her back to normal, stabilise her and the surgery was able to be completed,' Mr Segal told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was part of our strict protocol as we did not want to send her to hospital with gaping wounds.'

Ms Rickhuss added that she was 'thankful that they went through with the rest of the procedure'. 

'The incident happened after they had completed one side. I was then stabilised and the paramedics and Dr Niro felt it was best to complete the surgery rather than leaving me with one implant and open wounds,' she said.

'Despite everything, I couldn't be happier. I'm so glad I've got two boobs instead of one!'

Mr Segal said his staff had following protocol to call an ambulance 'as quickly as possible'. 

'We've performed well over 10,000 procedures, and... with any type of procedure that you undergo, there are always going to be risks associated with it,' he said.

The incident was described as an 'unforeseen event that occurred, unrelated to the surgery itself' on the clinic's Facebook page and further confirmed their patient has 'made a full recovery'.

The clinic advertises a number of cosmetic procedures including breast implants, liposuction, labiaplasty and eyelid rejuvenation.
