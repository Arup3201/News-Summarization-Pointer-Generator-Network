Aston Villa and Tottenham have both been fined £20,000 by the Football Association for failing to control their players during their recent Premier League game.

The clubs had admitted breaching FA rules by 'failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion', an FA statement read.

A scuffle involving numerous players broke out at the Villa Park game on November 2 after the home team's Belgian striker Christian Benteke received a red card.

Villa were leading 1-0 at the time, with 24 minutes left, but Spurs hit back against their 10 men to win 2-1. 

Benteke received a three-match ban for lashing out at Tottenham's Ryan Mason - a punishment manager Paul Lambert labelled 'excessive'. 

The Villa boss remains adamant that the punishment does not fit the crime, even though the FA disagreed.
