maintain our dignity as well!'

Firemen stripping down to their flame-retardant trousers for charity calendars is an end-of-the-year tradition all over the country.

But it's never been done by the brave fire-fighting women of Britain's emergency services. Until now.

The ladies of the South Yorkshire fire brigade have been even braver than usual, stripping off to take part in a scantily clad photo shoot for a calender to raise money for Cancer Research UK and the Fire Fighters Charity.

Smokin' hot! Female fire-fighters strip off for Britain's first ever all-women charity calender to raise money for Cancer Research UK

The women from Barnsley, Rotherham and Sheffield emergency services have stripped down to their underwear for the first UK female-only fire fighter calendar, Fire Girls 2013, which is being sold on eBay for £6.

In the smoking hot photos the women - Fleur Doyle, Jade Styan, Nicole Hallat, Claire Morton, Frankie Salerno, Sally Stark, Sian Nortcliffe and Angie Thrope - are seen posing in their bras holding hoses, leaning across laders, fooling around in the fire foam, hanging out with Father Christmas, wearing hard hats, drinking water and lounging across cars and beside the fire truck.

Aged 23 to 54, the women admitted they were nervous at first but now hope the calender will be the first in a series. Miss August - Angie Thorp, 40, a South Yorkshire fire service crew manager - said: 'None of us had ever modelled before. But we all had a really good time.

'We hope it will be the first of a series. We are planning to do a double sided calendar next year with the men on one side and the girls on the other - and Christmas cards. All of us were a bit embarrassed about posing. But the fire men made us full of confidence and we had a lot of help form the guys.

'Our husbands were also very supportive and many of those buying the calendar are male colleagues' wives who want it as a stocking filler for their husbands. All of us did the race for life twice in full kit with breathing apparatus and decided to do the calendar as the next step.

'We are all fire fighters but we are also all normal people doing a normal job.'

The pictures for the calendar were taken at a fire station in Rotherham,
with the permission of senior officers and involved ladies from 
Barnsley, Rotherham and Sheffield.

Despite obtaining permission to film on 
fire service premises, there was no question of any pole dancing or 
other no-hold-barred poses. To avoid bringing the fire service into disrepute the women limited 
themselves to stripping off their tunics to reveal their bras or opening
up their coats to show what they wear underneath - when not fighting 
fires or checking smoke alarms.

To those who might consider this way of raising money for charity undignified, the women said: 'We desperately wanted to raise as much money as we could but also to 
maintain our dignity as well - because we have to come to work after it 
all!'

With only nine girls and 12 months to fill three of the pages are group 
shots. But the the calendar has caused such a buzz there should be no 
shortage of female fire-fighting buddies willing to strut their stuff 
for the 2014 edition.

Miss Thorp added: 'So many girls are interested in taking part next year it is a shame there are not 24 months in a year.'We were all a bit nervous at first, but ended up having a really good time and it has brought us closer together.'

The first published 1,000 calendars are selling so well at £5 each the 
girls are confident of raising £5,000 are a further print run is on the 
cards. The money will go to Cancer Research UK and the Fire Fighters' Charity.

Fire girl Fleur Doyle, 37, was among the first to answer the call of 
duty. She blushed: 'At the photo shoot it was a bit daunting to whip our jackets off and expose ourselves in our bras. But once we relaxed the photographer made us feel at ease. It was good fun and we've all become great friends by doing it.

'All of us have friends or family that have been struck by cancer and Cancer Research UK is such a brilliant cause.  And we have got colleagues who have been off sick that have been burned
in fires - and the Fire Fighters' Charity does so much for them.'
