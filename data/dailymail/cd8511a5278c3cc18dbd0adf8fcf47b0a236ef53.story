As any pet owner knows... a split can be painful for animals you have reared together.

And though they may not have any children, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart are parents to a rescue dog called Bear, who has just found himself at the centre of a bitter custody dispute.

Kristen, 22, also has a cat, Max, who she will keep but 26-year-old Robert wants Bear – the mixed breed rescue they adopted from a high-kill shelter in New Orleans.

But Kristen won’t give up Bear easily, the California girl nursed the pup through his battle with the potentially fatal disease Parvo.

She's also spent a lot of time with the dog and has flown him around the country with her.

'After Rob moved his things out of their Los Angeles apartment, he then told Kristen he wanted Bear,' an insider told RadarOnline.com.

'She was heartbroken – they adopted Bear together and she always felt that he was their little baby.

'But Rob was so hurt by Kristen’s actions he decided that he wants the dog to help him get over what happened. After all, a dog is a man’s best friend and Bear is such a good companion.

'However, Kristen won’t give up Bear in a hurry. She helped Rob save Bear from Parvo disease, which nearly took its life when it was a puppy.

'She wants joint custody – and it could get a little messy,' the source revealed.

According to the mole, the couple were planning to get another dog just before the revelation of Kristen's fling broke.

'Robert and Kristen were looking into the possibility of adopting another dog. They were desperate for a play pal for Bear and scoured petfinder.com, as well as a few high-kill shelters in Los Angeles. But it seems that’s out of the question now,' the insider said.

A large U-Haul truck was pictured over the weekend pulling out of the driveway from the $6 million Los Feliz home they shared, prompting speculation that Rob is going for good.

The pair are not on speaking terms and are living apart following the publication of photos that show Kristen getting close to Snow and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders, who was today spotted out and about in LA wearing his wedding ring.

Rob now wants a 'man to man' chat with Sanders who also betrayed the young actor as they had become good friends and spent time together as couples with the director’s actress wife Liberty Ross.
