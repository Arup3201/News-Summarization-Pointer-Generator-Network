A disgusted couple say their romantic evening was ruined after discovering a giant cockroach during their meal.

Stu Beevers made the sickening discovery while dining out with girlfriend Natalie Roberts, 27, in Manchester's Curry Mile. The 28-year-old said he had been enjoying his chicken kerala at Mughli Restaurant when he noticed the insect which was the size of a two pound coin.

The pair were so disgusted by the grim discovery they left the restaurant without paying in protest.

Disgusting: A cockroach was discovered by a couple who had gone for a romantic evening out at a restaurant in Manchester's Curry Mile

The couple, both from Stockport, are now set to report the incident to Manchester Council and say the unwanted ingredient left Stu vomiting all night following the meal on Saturday.

Mughli closed immediately after being notified of the cockroach last Saturday for an internal investigation although the restaurant was open for business again last week.

Natalie, from Heaton Moor, said: 'It was massive. As soon as we saw it we both just felt sick and wanted to get out of there.

'We pointed it out to the waiter and were asking for an apology but we got nothing.

'It seemed all they were interested in was getting the plate off us and getting rid of the evidence, I made sure I kept hold of it and took a picture.

'It's disgusting. We went because it's meant to be one of the more upmarket restaurants on Curry Mile but this just isn't on - we want to warn people and make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else.'

After the insect, which was the size of a two pound coin, was found, the restaurant closed and are now carrying out a full investigation

Mughli, which also has a restaurant in Knutsford, Cheshire, was given a four-star 'very good' rating in its last inspection by Manchester council food hygiene officers in October 2012.

A spokesman for the restaurant said: 'Immediately that the allegation was received, an apology was made and the restaurant closed with no more food being served to allow us to make a full investigation.

'From initial reports it does not appear that the insect was cooked in the curry dish.

'Allegations such as this are taken very seriously - with no previous history of such incidents it is just as important to us as the customer to establish how this happened.

'We are a family-run restaurant of 23 years and we, our staff, family and friends eat here all the time.

'Every precaution to find out where the cockroach could have come from has been made and we have passed it to our hygiene specialists for further investigation.

'Vermin is a problem in the area but we are very pro-active in managing it. 'We have regular visits from our hygiene specialist and no evidence of any cockroach activity had been found on the visit prior to and immediately after the alleged incident took place.

'We will, of course, continue to look into this matter and find out how this could have happened.'
