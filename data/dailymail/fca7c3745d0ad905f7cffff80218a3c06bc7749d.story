Swiss banking giant UBS has revealed that the scale of the losses allegedly racked up by 'rogue trader' Kweku Adoboli has risen from £1.3billion to £1.5billion.

The Swiss bank said the loss was caused by unauthorised trades on stock 
index futures made over the past three months.

It said the transactions were within normal limits and slipped through 
risk controls due to ‘fictitious trades’ in complex financial 
instruments called exchange traded funds (ETFs), which were used to 
cover up losses.

The bank said that 'the true magnitude
of the risk exposure was distorted' because the hedges that traders are
required to put in place had been fabricated.

Switzerland’s biggest lender also 
suggested that the trades in question involved 'unauthorised 
speculative' bets on various S&P 500, Dax and Eurostoxx index 
futures, rather than on the Swiss franc, as some had thought.

UBS claims that the non-existent 
hedges entered into its records were 'fictitious, forward-settling, cash
ETF [exchange-traded fund] positions', trades that had never actually 
been executed.

UBS also countered suggestions that it 
did not notice the trades until Adoboli came forward.

They said the 
31-year-old trader – charged on Friday with fraud and false accounting –
had been responding to the bank’s inquiries.

It claims that the irregularities came to light last Wednesday during a review of Kweku Adoboli’s trading book, which it has now unwound. Adoboli is then alleged to have 'revealed' the extent of his trading activity.

Defiant: UBS boss Oswald Gruebel said he would not be resigning

The bank has now launched an internal investigation into the catastrophic failure of its risk systems.

UBS said its board of directors had set up a committee chaired by independent director David Sidwell, former chief financial officer at Morgan Stanley, to conduct an independent investigation into the trades and the bank's control systems.

The Swiss bank stunned markets on Thursday when it announced unauthorised trades had lost it about £1.25billion.

The bank raised the figure by a further £1.9million on Sunday, and chief executive Oswald Gruebel said the alleged fraud would have consequences for strategy and possibly also for himself.

The loss is a heavy blow to the reputation of Switzerland's biggest bank, which had just started to recover after its near collapse during the financial crisis and a damaging U.S. investigation into its aiding wealthy Americans to dodge taxes.

By 7.45am today UBS shares were down 1.6 per cent at 10.10 francs, outperforming a 2.6 per cent slide on the European banking stocks index.

UBS boss Oswald Gruebel said he would not be resigning, and said calls for his 
resignation were ‘purely political’ and that he was ‘not thinking about 
stepping down’.

He added that while he bore ultimate responsibility, he did not feel 
‘guilty’ for failing to prevent the costly and embarrassing incident.

His defiant stance comes amid 
suggestions that Swiss regulators could tell the bank to hive off or 
close down its investment banking division, which houses the ‘Delta One’
desk where Adoboli worked. Such a drastic response would deal a huge 
blow to the City, where UBS employs some 6000 workers.

The Financial Services Authority and 
Swiss regulators have drafted in accountancy firm Deloitte to 
investigate the affair.
Meanwhile, UBS senior independent director David Sidwell – a former 
finance chief at JP Morgan Chase – is leading the bank’s own probe into 
the matter.
