Manchester City star Yaya Toure says his greatest Champions League memory is keeping out Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo as Barcelona won the 2009 Champions League final.

The powerhouse midfielder was deployed at centre back in the final in Rome alongside former United defender Gerard Pique as Barca ran out 2-0 winners and prevented Sir Alex Ferguson's side winning back-to-back European Cups.

Yaya Toure is now in his fifth season at Manchester City after joining from Barcelona in 2010

Toure, now 31, has not been able to progress beyond the group stage since joining City in 2010 but he still holds fond memories of the night he kept out 'the top class strikers in the world'.

Toure said: 'The final in the Champions League [against Manchester United in 2009] where we were able to play and defend in front of [two of] the top class strikers in the world [Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney].

'Lifting the trophy [with Barcelona] was the most important, it was the first time I was able to touch this trophy.'

City, who face Roma on Wednesday night knowing a win is likely to see them through to the group stages, will be hoping Toure will be able to touch the trophy again come May.
