The daily commute to work will be consigned to history by superfast broadband making it easier to work from home, minsters claim.

High speed web access at home will dramatically cut business travel, save millions on travel costs and give everyone more free time.

The majority of people will work from home several days every month, a major government study predicts.

The future? Most people will work from home several days every month once superfast broadband is rolled out, the government claims

Increasing internet speeds will save British households a total of £270 million and 60 million hours of leisure time each year by 2024, the new report predicts.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller said as well as bringing economic benefits, it will also have a ‘positive impact on the way we live’.

It is claimed that better connectivity would help more people save cash by avoiding commuting and cut annual business travel by 3.3 billion miles (5.3 billion km) a year - around 9 per cent of the current annual UK total.

The report states: ‘As levels of connectivity at home improve, this will tend to encourage higher levels of working from home – the majority of which will be people working a few days per month from home, rather than teleworking full-time.’

The study estimates that about 60 million hours of leisure time will be saved through increased teleworking

It also predicts that it will make it easier for older people, carers and the disabled to take up some part-time work from home.

‘The prevalence of this will increase as levels of home connectivity improve over time.’

The report estimates that the increase in teleworking made possible by faster broadband will save about 60 million hours of leisure time per year in the UK by 2024.

‘By avoiding commuting costs, the additional teleworking enabled by faster broadband will lead to total household savings rising to £270 million per annum by 2024.’

It adds: ‘The underlying hypothesis for our model is that speed matters: faster broadband will enable businesses and individuals to change the way they do things.’

By 2024 faster broadband could cut the UK¿s annual commuting distance by 2.3 billion km, predominantly through less car usage

The findings are contained in the UK Broadband Impact Study Impact Report, by analysts SQW with Cambridge Econometrics.

British Telecom has secured several contracts to deliver access to super-fast broadband connections to 90% of the UK by 2015, in line with Government targets.

Mrs Miller said: ‘What this report shows us is that, as well as super-fast broadband being good for economic growth, it will make even more of a positive impact on the way we live, helping us work more productively and get online faster.

‘Our broadband roll-out is one of the best in Europe, with almost three-quarters of the UK able to access super-fast speeds. This is making a real difference to people in communities across the UK from small businesses able to expand, schoolchildren being able to log on to do their homework or people being able to work from home.

‘This investment in technology is vital for our future and will help Britain continue to compete in the global race and improve the way we live and work.’

Mrs Miller is due to take part in a Twitter Q&A from 4.45pm on Monday on high speed broadband using the hashtag #askdcms.

People working from home would save £350million on commuter costs, but would spend £80million more on heating their homes for work

The Commons spending watchdog - the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) - last month raised concerns that consumers were not benefiting from healthy competition in this project, adding BT had all of the 26 contracts let by June 2013 and was expected to secure the remaining 18.

Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant repeated claims in the House of Commons this month that BT had been given a ‘bung’ by the Government, making it almost impossible for other operators to compete to provide broadband in semi-rural areas. The suggestion was denied by the Government.
