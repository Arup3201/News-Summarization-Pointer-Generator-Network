Amanda Knox was spotted in Seattle running errands on Valentine’s Day weekend for the first time since news of her engagement broke.

The 27-year-old bride did a bit of shopping, while her musician fiancé Colin Sutherland went to work.

Knox, who was not wearing an engagement ring, was seen walking through Chinatown on Valentine's Day before going for a curry with a female friend.

During the first part of her outing, Knox was sporting a casual ensemble composed of a maxi red skirt paired with a black blouse, an olive-green parka lined with fur and lace-up ankle boots.

She later changed into a red sweater and a pair of black pants and headed to a restaurant. 

At one point, the 27-year-old bride-to-be appeared upset, wearing a concerned look on her face, blemished by what appeared to be a cold sore or a scratch over her lip.

But the conversation with her mystery dinner companion apparently turned to a more pleasant topic later, because Knox turned animated and was seen smiling broadly and folding her hands over her chest, as if she was pretending to hug someone.

The following day, Ms Knox headed to a Safeway supermarket for some food shopping. She emerged from the store sometime later laden with bulging grocery bags and sporting a pair of loose jeans, dark-colored clogs and the familiar parka coat.

On Monday, the thrifty wife-to-be visited a Goodwill thrift store.

The news of Knox's engagement was first reported in a Seattle Times column on Wednesday.  

Columnist Jonathan Martin writes that Knox confirmed the engagement to him via email but said nothing more. 

The pair were engaged last week. No date has been set for the nuptials.

Before her current love was revealed in September, Knox was known to be living in Seattle with her classical guitarist then-boyfriend James Terrano.

A LinkedIn profile for Sutherland once listed his name as Thunderstrike after the Marvel comic-book character - says he studied French at Sarah Lawrence

Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school.  

She was set to graduate from the University of Washington this past June with a degree in creative writing. 

She's now working at a Seattle bookstore and as a writer for the West Seattle Herald.

Heavy burden: The following day, Ms Knox headed to a Safeway supermarket for some food shopping.

Meanwhile, her case is headed back into the Italian courts once again following an initial conviction, an overturning of that conviction followed by her reconviction along with Sollecito.

It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the US, will ever be returned to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. If she is convicted again, Italy is likely to request to extradite her but her longstanding battle to prove her innocence has made her a cause célèbre in the U.S who may ignore political pressure to send her back. 

Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009.

The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013.

In January last year a court upheld the original verdict, but the pair remained at large as under Italy's legal system, any verdict reached after a second appeal but be ratified by the highest court. 

Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology. 

Back then: Knox was accused along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (both at left) of brutally murdering Knox's roommate in Perugia, Italy Meredith Kercher, 21 (right) in 2007

Kercher, 21, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. Some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police.

Detectives concluded the supposed break-in looked staged and Knox became the prime suspect.

She then implicated Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner she worked for. The duo were arrested along with Sollecito. Mr Lumumba was later released when evidence pointed to Rudy Guede's involvement.

Guede was then accused of committing the murder along with Sollecito and Knox. In October 2008 he was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher. 

Home for good: While it's highly unlikely that Knox would be extradited no matter what happens in court in March, her ex Raffaele Sollecito must face the music in his home country

Still at risk: Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology
