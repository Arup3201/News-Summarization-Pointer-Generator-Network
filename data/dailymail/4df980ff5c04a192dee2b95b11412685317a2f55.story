The jobless are to be tracked online to see if they are looking for work.

A
new website launched by ministers will remotely monitor whether 
benefits claimants are making enough effort to find employment.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith warned that 
jobseekers could see their benefits slashed if they fail to look for 
three jobs a week on the ‘revolutionary’ new government website.

The new Universal Jobmatch site will remotely track whether the unemployed are doing enough to look for work, and match their CVs to vacancies while they sleep

He unveiled the new site, Universal 
Jobmatch, which will enable jobseekers to input their details into a 
computer system and then receive suitable vacancies.

The system will trawl vacancies while the jobless are asleep in a bid to get them into work, Mr Duncan Smith said.

They will also receive advice on what 
skills they needed to improve their chances of finding work.

He warned that those who do not make an effort and use the service could see their benefits cut.

‘If you choose not to take a job that matches you, then the adviser will
look at your reasons, and if the adviser thinks “actually, these are 
pretty specious reasons”, he may call you in and say “I think you really
need to be applying for these jobs”,’ he said.

The system will be fully launched in the New Year following a trial 
period, with 370,000 companies already using it to advertise jobs. 
Online recruitment firm Monster will manage the site, which will be 
compulsory for jobseekers to use at the start of next year.

Mr Duncan Smith said the system was ‘brilliant’, adding: ‘It will be 
accessible in internet cafes, libraries and on personal computers.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan warned the jobless will have their benefits cuts if they fail to look for three jobs a week on a new website

‘It is a real revolution in the way we match future employers with 
would-be employees. Your CV will do the work for you, even when you are 
sleeping, and notify you that a suitable job has become available.’

Meanwhile, Mr Duncan Smith is prepared for a political battle with 
Labour over the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill, published yesterday.

The bill limits the year-on-year increase of benefits to 1 per cent – 
around the same level as the increase in wages for working people.

Chancellor George Osborne claimed in the Commons the cap was to ensure 
fairness for those who go to work while their neighbours have their 
curtains drawn.

But Liam Byrne, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said many benefits claimants in work would also be hit.

‘The Strivers’ Tax Bill is a naked attack on hard working families to 
pay the price for this government’s economic failure,’ he said.

‘I want to bring down the welfare bill. But the way we do that is with 
jobs. Labour will not support a bill that does nothing to create a 
single new job yet punishes those who work.’

Mr Duncan Smith has also backed a new payment card for benefit claimants with drink and drug addictions – to prevent them from wasting taxpayers’ money fuelling their habits.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said his department was studying the possibility of introducing a ‘welfare card’ for claimants with drug and alcohol addiction problems.

The plan, under which claimants would receive the card rather than cash and would only be able to buy certain essential items, is being pushed by Tory backbencher Alec Shelbrooke.
