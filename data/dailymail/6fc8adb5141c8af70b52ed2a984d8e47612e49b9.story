The British-educated son of former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi appeared in a criminal court today accused of threatening state security.

Saif al-Islam, 40, is facing charges relating to a visit last year from a lawyer from the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The lawyer is said to have illegally passed on information to Gaddafi, who has a PhD from the London School of Economics.

Accused: Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the British-educated son of former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, appeared in a criminal court today accused of threatening state security

The court, in the Libyan town of Zintan, heard that Gaddafi is also facing war crimes allegations dating back to the 2011 rebellion which saw his father deposed and killed after more than four decades in power.

Today Gaddafi appointed local lawyers for the first time, and spoke to confirm his identity. When asked his state of health he gave a thumbs up sign.

Gaddafi faces charges of illegally exchanging classified information, obtaining documents that threatened Libyan national security and insulting the country's new national flag.

Gaddafi wore a sky blue suit and a pair of sandals at today's court appearance. He remained standing throughout the 15-minute hearing.

Evidence was briefly presented at the hearing, including a pen with a camera in it and a watch.The prosecution alleges that both devices were used to pass on secret information.

In June last year, ICC lawyer Melinda Taylor and three other ICC staff were arrested and held for the three weeks after visiting Gaddafi.

The lawyer was accused of secretly passing Gaddafi a coded letter from a fugitive former aide, Mohammed Ismail.

The four were subsequently released to The Hague and are not expected to return to Libya to face charges.

Representatives from human rights organisations were also present at the hearing, at which Gaddafi's trial was postponed until 19 September.

Gaddafi has been held in Zintan since rebels from the town captured him in November 2011.
