For daredevil gorilla Alf the lure of a horde of autumnal acorns proved too much to bear.

After discovering a tasty treat lurking at the foot of a nearby oak tree, the intelligent western lowland ape turned his attention skywards gazing longingly at the bounty hanging in the canopy above his head.

Fearless, the 17-stone primate stunned keepers at Longleat Safari and Adventure Park by clambering through the branches of the oak tree to perch precariously 40ft above the enclosure's lake.

Daring: Brave Alf, the western lowland gorilla, stunned keepers at Longleat Safari Park, when he scaled the great heights of a 40ft oak tree

Intrigued: After foraging around in the grass at the foot of the oak tree, Alf, the 10-year-old ape, gazes skywards at the bounty of acorns hanging above his head, left. The bright beast carefully tested each precarious branch to check it could take his 17-stone weight

Foraging: Scouring the branches Alf feasts on the tasty autumnal treats

With each step, the bright beast, carefully tested the branches anxious to see if they would take his weight.

The 10-year-old edged his way further along the tree's seemingly shaky arms, balancing high above the half-mile expanse of water as he tucked into the nuts.

Looking on, Alf's bemused older brothers Evindi, seven, and 14-year-old silverback Kesho kept their feet firmly rooted to the ground.

Staff at the Wiltshire wildlife park watched in awe, carefully monitoring Alf's daring exploits.

Brothers Alf, Evindi and Kesho, are part of the bachelor troop of gorillas at the park's Gorilla Colony, which opened last year.

Keeper Mark Tye said: 'Alf has always been the more adventurous of the brothers and he also seems to be the most fearless.

Stunned: Keepers at the safari park said they were surprised to see 'daredevil' Alf clamber so high into the canopy. A spokesman said while they are natural climbers the gorillas tend to keep their feet on the ground

'We’re not entirely sure why he felt the need to climb up quite so high to collect the acorns as there were plenty lying on the ground but perhaps he was looking for a bit of peace and quiet and knew the others weren’t going to join him.

'Although the branches look quite delicate, Alf is a very smart gorilla and he carefully tested them before venturing out along them,' he added.

A Longleat spokesman added: 'Naturally gorillas forage for their food, for whatever is around, be it nuts or fruit.

'They are good climbers but don't normally climb that high. Alf clearly has a head for heights. He is a bit of a daredevil.

'Gorillas certainly are not natural swimmers which is why we have the lake beside their enclosure as a more natural divide rather than bars or fencing.

'Staff observed and monitored the situation but weren't too concerned.'

He said Alf is usually spotted feasting on a mix of fruit and vegetables, weighing around 5kg a day, with bananas and strawberries topping his list of favourite treats.

Based on Alf needing around 5kg of food a day, the primate would need to munch his way through more than 800 of the tiny nuts to sustain him. Each acorn contains 23 calories.

Satisfied: Edging closer to his goal, the western lowland gorilla perched precariously in the tree, tucking into his well-earned snack

The brothers, who were all born at Dublin Zoo, were reunited for the first time in 2010 to form the new male-only colony at Longleat.

The £3million enclosure features an extensive outdoor grassy area and overlooks the park's Half Mile Lake.

In addition to the trees, keepers installed a range of outdoor climbing logs and frames for the four-strong troop to enjoy.

As well as the three brothers, the enclosure is home to Boulas who came from Twycross Zoo.

The western lowland gorilla is native to Africa and is the smallest type of gorilla, with males reaching around 6ft tall and around 26 stone.

Western lowland gorillas are native to Africa. While endangered they are more common than their mountain gorilla cousins

While an endangered species, western lowland gorillas remain more common than their relatives, the mountain gorilla.

In
 the wild, they live in heavy rainforests in Cameroon, Central African 
Republic, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo.

It is not known exactly how many live in the wild.

They are smaller than their mountain gorilla cousins and have shorter hair and longer arms.

Gorillas have a good head for heights but are usually found on the ground living in troops of up to 30.

Troops are led by one dominant, older adult male - often called a silverback.

The
 leader of the group organises activities including eating, nesting in 
leaves and moving around the troop's three-quarter to 16-square-mile 
home range.

The silverback will often give impressive displays of his
 physical power, standing upright, throwing things, making agressive 
charges and pounding his chest while barking out a powerful roar.

Despite these displays, gorillas are generally calm and are rarely aggressive.

They are vegetarians and snack on roots, shoots, fruit, wild celery and tree bark and pulp.Females give birth to one infant after a nine-month pregnancy.

Infants ride on their mothers' backs for the first two or three years of their lives.

The primates are under threat in the wild from deforestation and hunters.
