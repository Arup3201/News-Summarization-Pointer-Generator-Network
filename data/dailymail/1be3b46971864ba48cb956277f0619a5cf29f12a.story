This is the dramatic moment tourists on a safari stood their ground against a charging African Bull Elephant.

Rather than flee, these hikers at Kruger National Park in South Africa put aside their fears and faced down the raging mammal after they stumbled upon the creature in the bush.

And the onlookers kept their cool while one of the tourists captured the moment on a video camera when the beast squared-up to the group.

The elephant then let out a roar while a guide aimed a rifle at its head to presumably keep the holidaymaker group from running away into the wild. 

After, the Bull Elephant - which can weigh up to 5.5 tons - turned away in the stand-off over a number of seconds, and the amateur filmmaker can be heard whispering: 'Everyone's able to breathe now.'

Cornel Rademeyer, the group's walking safari guide, in a supposed respect for the raging mammal, said to the tour group: 'We don't hunt elephants – he came to us.'

After the animal squared-off and beat back into the bush, the tourists can be later seen smiling and breathing a sigh of relief at the frightening moment which put them in a head-to-head with the beast.

Luckily for all involved they walked away with their lives and have the terrifying moment on film to look back on in the years ahead.

Earlier, the onlookers in the park had  been watching the African Bull Elephant from a safe distance in the bush

And unlike most tourists who come away from safaris with only snaps from wild animals at a distance, this group have a video to show their family and friends that show they got 'the real' experience.

But German tourists last year at Kruger National Park had a more violent stand-off with an elephant.

The rampaging mammal reacted with fury to a car the group was travelling in.

The wild beast stormed on to the dust track the holidaymakers were driving on and charged straight at their vehicle.

Here the tour groups laughs and smiles and enjoy looking at each other's photos from the hair-raising moment

Video footage captured the moment the five-tonne bull elephant smashed its way in to the car using only one of its dagger-sharp tusks.

Wildlife watchers inside the vehicle yelled 'Drive, drive, drive!' and fled the elephant, which had just fought off a rival at Kruger National Park in South Africa.

One of the Germans quipped as they sped away: 'I think we lost the deposit.'

Nobody was injured in the incident, despite broken glass showering the interior of the vehicle.

Bull elephants have tusks up to 5ft long which are often used for goring rivals in battles for supremacy of Africa's vast plains and savannahs. Male elephants grow up to 13ft in height and often over females.
