Former Met chief Sir Paul Stephenson has been cleared of any misconduct during the phone-hacking inquiry

Scotland Yard’s former chief and his top officer, who were forced to quit over the phone-hacking scandal, launched a furious broadside at the police watchdog as they were cleared of misconduct yesterday.

Former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and ex-Assistant Commissioner John Yates reacted with anger after the Independent Police Complaints Commission announced that they had been exonerated over their handling of the inquiry.

Sir Paul took a swipe at the watchdog for wasting resources, while Mr Yates was said to be ‘utterly furious’ that weeks after he was forced to stand down the IPCC probe had been dropped.

The development came a day after a bombshell letter emerged which suggested that phone hacking was common knowledge at the News of the World while Andy Coulson – who later went to work for David Cameron as his No 10 spin chief before resigning over the hacking furore – was editor.

Scotland Yard was plunged into crisis after it lost Sir Paul and Mr Yates, who had a combined 64 years of experience.

Both men quit over the furore surrounding the force’s hiring of hacking suspect Neil Wallis – a former News of the World deputy editor – as a PR consultant and Sir Paul’s £12,000 freebie at a luxury health spa promoted by Mr Wallis, who was arrested in July over alleged phone hacking.

Yesterday Sir Paul criticised the IPCC for scrutinising his free five-week stay at the Champneys resort in Hertfordshire while he recovered after having a pre-cancerous tumour removed from his leg in January.

Acpo president, Sir Hugh Orde fell foul of politicians because of his plain speaking during the officers but that could make him popular with officers. He went for the job in 2008 but missed out narrowly and worked as head of police in Northern Ireland

An officer without controversy, acting commissioner Tim Godwin has worked his way up the ranks. He surprised MPs by saying he though about closing down Twitter and faced criticism for keeping a low profile during the riots

Stephen House has spent six years at the Met as head of the specialist crime command. He is currently the chief constable of Strathclyde Police which was praised by David Cameron last week for its work on combating gangs

Bernard Hogan-Howe is a well-liked ex-chief constable of Merseyside Police and is now acting deputy commissioner at the Met. He is considered a strong candidate as he supervised Soca and the policing of the Olympic Games

Sir Paul said: ‘The outcome of the 
Metropolitan Police Authority’s referral of myself to the IPCC is as I 
would have expected it to be. I regret resources have had to be expended
on this matter.

‘The IPCC’s comments about my 
acceptance of assistance from a friend through my family, unconnected to
my professional life, of services from Champneys’ Medical Services, 
which they chose to examine under their powers without any external 
referral, does in my view fall a little short of full and proper 
context. However, this is a matter for their judgment.’

Yesterday the IPCC also threw out 
allegations of misconduct against former Met Assistant Commissioner Andy
Hayman and former Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke.

But investigators are still pressing 
ahead with a probe into claims that Mr Yates secured a job for Mr 
Wallis’s daughter. The officer is accused of arranging a civilian role 
at Scotland Yard for Amy Wallis, 27.

Mr Yates resigned last month after he 
came under fire for his handling of the phone hacking inquiry and his 
close friendship with Mr Wallis, 60, during a time when he was involved 
in the hacking investigation.

IPCC deputy chairman Deborah Glass 
said he would face no further action in relation to his handling of the 
phone hacking investigation, although she said investigators agreed with
Mr Yates’s own admission that his decision not to review the hacking 
evidence in 2009 was ‘poor’.

Home Secretary Theresa May said top American policeman Bill Bratton was not in the running for the job

Mr Yates said: ‘I am disappointed with
the IPCC’s decision to investigate my peripheral involvement in 
recruitment process of Neil Wallis’s daughter. I strongly deny any 
wrongdoing and I am completely confident that I will be exonerated.’

On Tuesday a letter emerged written by
disgraced former News of the World royal reporter Clive Goodman four 
years ago in which he claimed that hacking was ‘widely discussed’ at the
paper until Mr Coulson banned all reference to it. The letter was part 
of a batch of papers made public by the Commons culture committee. Its 
release has led to claims by Labour MP Tom Watson that it pointed to 
‘one of the largest cover-ups’ he had seen in his lifetime.

The new documents also reveal that Mr 
Goodman said Mr Coulson had promised he could have his job back if he 
didn’t implicate colleagues and was paid nearly £250,000 by the company –
even after he was jailed in 2007.

Mr Watson has said the latest claims 
suggested previous evidence given by Mr Coulson to the committee was ‘at
best misleading and probably deceptive’.

Explosive correspondence released by the Commons culture select committee on Tuesday, which includes allegations pointing to a massive corporate cover-up by News International, has re-ignited the phone-hacking scandal.

Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK examines what it means for the main protagonists.

ANDY COULSON

The ex-News of the World editor has always insisted he was unaware of any phone hacking on his watch.

A dynamite letter from Clive Goodman, written in 2007 upon his release from jail for hacking royal mobile phone messages, claims that the practice was widely discussed at editorial meetings until Mr Coulson himself banned further references to it.

Goodman also says Mr Coulson offered to let him keep his job if he agreed not to implicate the paper’s staff in hacking when his case came to court.

Denial: Andy Coulson has insisted he was unaware of any phone hacking on his watch

If true – and these are only allegations at this stage – the former No 10 communications director would stand accused of lying to Parliament, perjury (he denied knowledge of hacking on oath, in the Tommy Sheridan perjury trial) and conspiracy to intercept phone messages.

Mr Coulson, who would face a lengthy jail term, is on police bail and unable to defend himself at this stage.

LES HINTON

The former executive chairman of News International, which owned the NotW, is at the heart of the latest revelations.

The Goodman letter, an appeal against his dismissal, was copied to Mr Hinton in March 2007. Mr Hinton faces the damaging allegation that, for years, he did not pass on the letter to police.

Four days after Goodman sent his letter, Mr Hinton appeared before MPs and did not disclose any of its contents. Instead, he said: ‘I believe absolutely that Andy [Coulson] did not have knowledge of what was going on.’

Mr Hinton resigned earlier this year, but could be taken back before MPs and accused of misleading Parliament.

JAMES MURDOCH

Questions: James Murdoch

He has insisted he did not know the full extent of hacking at the NotW. In particular, he told MPs that at the time he personally authorised a £700,000 pay-off to one hacking victim, he was not aware of evidence that suggested phone hacking was not limited to a single rogue NotW journalist (Goodman).

The letters published on Tuesday show that Tom Crone, an ex-NotW lawyer, and former editor Colin Myler both dispute this.

They say Mr Murdoch was told about an email implicating a second reporter.

MPs want to know if Mr Murdoch misled Parliament. They are also likely to ask whether it’s conceivable that he was unaware of the 2007 Goodman letter.

RUPERT MURDOCH

News International has repeatedly defended itself by reference to an internal investigation conducted by the legal firm Harbottle & Lewis (H&L).

It was commissioned in the wake of receipt of Goodman’s letter, and concluded – after the examination of 2,500 emails between NotW staff – that there was nothing to suggest Mr Coulson or other senior executives knew about Goodman’s activities.

In his humbling appearance before MPs last month, and with NI using the H&L report to defend itself, Rupert Murdoch said the firm had been employed to ‘find out what the hell was going on’.

This caused fury at H&L, which wrote to MPs describing this claim as ‘inaccurate and misleading’. The lawyers say they had a narrow remit to look only at whether Goodman’s claims would stack up in an employment tribunal – not to give NI a ‘good conduct certificate’.

DAVID CAMERON

The greater the trouble Mr Coulson finds himself in, the worse it gets for the Prime Minister, whose judgment in appointing the spin doctor – and taking him into Downing Street – is called into ever greater question.

If the allegations against Mr Coulson are proved, Mr Cameron will have to explain whether he was lied to, or if he didn’t bother to ask key questions about his friend’s past.

Uncertain: If allegations against Coulson are proved, David Cameron will have to give plenty of answers to questions about his spin doctor

Critics ask if it is really likely that Mr Coulson was given such a key job without aides approaching Goodman, or senior NI executives, to check if any new allegations were likely to emerge.

Others – notably ex-Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson – have resigned for having looser links to NI executives implicated in the hacking scandal than those held by the PM.
