A babysitter sexually assaulted an 11-month-old child before sending photographs of the assault to her boyfriend, according to authorities.

Ashley Virginia Dack, 29, and Patrick Schuneman, 37, were arrested last week after another friend, whom Dack had told about the assaults, went to the Harris County Sheriff's Office in Texas.

The friend took text messages from Dack's phone after she asked him to charge it for her and when he went to authorities last October, they executed search warrants on the couple's homes.

After seizing an iPhone from one of the homes they discovered horrifying messages, investigators said, according to Click2Houston.

Arrested: Ashley Virginia Dack, left, and her boyfriend Patrick Schuneman, right, allegedly sexually abused children and sent each other text messages plotting or describing the attacks, investigators said

In one exchange on August 30, 2012, Dack described 'a little girl at lunch with blonde pig tails' and said she wished he had been waiting in the car so she could bring him the child.

'Would love that,' he responded.

Dack allegedly then detailed how they would hold the girl down, saying: 'No one could hear her if we were in my car.'

In another text message in 2013, Dack sent her boyfriend an image showing her inappropriately touching an 11-month-old child, to which Schuneman responded: 'Incredible... Thank you.'

Investigators found the mother of the child and learned that Dack had been looking after the 11-month-old the same day the pictures and texts were sent, Click2Houston reported. 

She and Schuneman conspired to sexually abuse children and photograph their exploits for their sexual gratification, investigators said.

The couple has now been charged with super aggravated sexual assault of a child and sexual performance by a child under the age of 14.

Dack is being held on a $350,000 bond, while the court declined bond for Schuneman.
