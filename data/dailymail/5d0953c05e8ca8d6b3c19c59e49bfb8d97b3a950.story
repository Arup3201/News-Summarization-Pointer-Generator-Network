Her mother and grandparents are accomplished equestrians.

And Mia Tindall could be set to follow in their footsteps after she was spotted watching international riders in action at the Festival of British Eventing today.

Donning a pink GAP top, white shorts and a sunhat, the adorable six-month-old joined her royal mother Zara Phillips at the festival at Gatcombe Park.Â

Family time: Mia Tindall was pictured with her royal mother Zara Phillips at the Festival of British Eventing today

She was seen smiling as they shared some quality mother-daughter time at the three-day annual event, which attracts thousands of visitors and incorporates the British Open, Intermediate and Novice Championships.

At one point, Mia was even pictured giggling as her mother changed her multi-coloured cardigan for the pink-and-white outfit.

The pair were later joined by Zara's sister-in-law Autumn Phillips, her daughters Savannah and Lola and Prince Edward's children Lady Louise Windsor and Viscount James Severn, who all braved the rain to watch the riders compete.

Zara, who won a silver medal in the 
London 2012 Olympics, was dressed casually for the day in a blue T-shirt
 and a dark blue gillet.

Grinning from ear to ear: At one point, Mia was even pictured giggling as her mother changed her multi-coloured cardigan for the pink-and-white outfit. Above, Zara holds her baby daughter before the change

But she later changed into her dressage 
gear as she competed in the show with her London Olympics horse High 
Kingdom ahead of the World Equestrian Games in Normandy later this 
month.

Mia was left in the capable hands of her father Mike Tindall, who was dressed in jeans, a blue jumper and a matching gillet, and her grandmother Princess Anne, who wore a long raincoat.

Yesterday, Zara joined her mother, the Princess Royal, and her father Mark Phillips, currently Chef d'Equipe for the U.S. eventing team, for the opening of the equestrian festival.

The trio appeared in good spirits, with 
Captain Phillips pictured throwing a protective arm around his daughter,
 while his first wife Princess Anne cracked a joke before rubbing her 
nose.

Showing her daughter how it's done: Zara, was dressed casually for the day in a blue T-shirt and gillet. But she later changed into her dressage gear as she competed in the show with her Olympics horse High Kingdom

Like the Princess Royal and Zara, Captain
 Phillips has enjoyed enormous success in the world of equestrianism, 
beginning with his gold medal winning appearance at the Munich Olympics 
in 1972.

As well as Olympics success, he won the Badminton Horse Trials in 1971 and 1972 riding Great Ovation, in 1974 on Colombus, and in 1981 on Lincoln.

After he retired from the Army, he continued to style himself Captain Mark Phillips - which was allowed as junior cavalry officers whose civilian work involves equestrianism may continue to use their rank.

While Zara is yet to win Olympic gold, 
she will be hoping for a good performance in Normandy later this month, 
with Team GB selectors for Rio 2016 expected to be in the crowd.

She will, at least, have the support of her London 2012 teammates William Fox-Pitt, Tina Cook, Nicola Wilson and Mary King, who are also expected to compete in France.

The Festival of British Eventing takes place at the Princess Royal's Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire, where Zara also lives.

As well as eventing, it features a shopping village, arena attractions and family entertainment.
