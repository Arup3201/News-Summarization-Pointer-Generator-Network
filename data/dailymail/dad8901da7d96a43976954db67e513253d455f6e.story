Ahead of England’s first World Cup game with Italy tomorrow, a wingsuit pilot has flown across a beach in Rio de Janeiro dressed in a specially designed St George’s Cross wingsuit, to cheer on the Three Lions.

EpicTV's Jhonathan Florez, an esteemed air athlete, was the lucky man to take on the threads and show his support for England.

After excitedly describing Brazil as a 
'pretty awesome place,' the pilot jumps out of a plane 4,000ft above sea
 level before landing on the Barra di Tijuca beach.

Loyal: Florez shows his support for England in the World Cup

Listen up: A close-up of the message, some 4,000ft above ground

During his stunt, Florez flips over to reveal a message to Roy Hodgson's team with 'come on boys' spelt out on the suit.

After some more flips, Florez deploys his parachute to land safely on the Rio de Janeiro beach.

The Colombian daredevil has four Guinness World Records to his name for longest duration wingsuit jump (9 minutes and 6 seconds), highest jump, greatest horizontal distance and greatest absolute distances flown.

All ready: Florez gets set for his World Cup stunt

Calm: The Colombian was in a relaxed mood ahead of his dive

Tony Uragallo, an English pioneer in wingsuit technology, was responsible for the suit’s distinctive design.

He said: 'I’m glad that I got to work on a project like this with the folks at EpicTV.'

Uragallo is US based and the founder of Tonysuit, the worlds largest jumpsuit manufacturer.

He is also a fantastic BASE jumper and wingsuit pilot in his own right who has previously competed for England in wing suiting. 

Take a picture: There's no doubting Florez' view was simply stunning

What's that? Those looking up to the sky may well have had to look again

Live the high life: He certainly had fun on his stunt

And down: There were no dramas as Florez ensured a safe landing on the Rio de Janeiro beach
