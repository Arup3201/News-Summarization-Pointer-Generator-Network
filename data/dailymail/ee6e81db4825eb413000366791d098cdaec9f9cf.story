His form alongside Martin Skrtel and Emre Can has turned Liverpool's defence into one of the meanest in the Premier League since Christmas.

But Mamadou Sakho has shown his softer side by volunteering to help out a local charity in Bootle restore a house.

The France defender exchanged the red of Liverpool's kit for builder's whites as he assisted two charities, An Hour For Others and Progressive Lifestyle Solutions, with some handiwork, as well as donating a shirt to be auctioned off for the cause.

Sakho wrote on a shirt handed to the builders 'Pour (for) A.H.F.D, keep up the good work, Y.N.W.A (You'll Never Walk Alone), Sakho.' 

The cause itself looks to see people donate time rather than money to help others out and Sakho was clearly impressed with the sense of community.

He made contact with the charity himself after seeing them on the internet and helped them for a couple of hours, before going to the local shop buy some treats for those who he had helped with the decorating.

Sakho's next appearance for Liverpool could come on Saturday, when his team take on Crystal Palace in the fifth round of the FA Cup.

Selhurst Park does not hold fond memories for Liverpool supporters after they squandered a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 last season, before losing 3-1 in this campaign.
