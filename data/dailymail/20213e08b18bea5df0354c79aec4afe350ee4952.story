Jonathan Bloomfield, 37, was filmed by a neighbour viciously punching and swearing at his 18-month-old Staffordshire bull terrier, Butch

A dog owner filmed punching his pet in the head has been banned from keeping animals - but now claims he should be compensated for an invasion of his privacy after the footage was posted on Facebook.

Jonathan Bloomfield, 37, was filmed by a neighbour viciously punching and swearing at his 18-month-old Staffordshire bull terrier, Butch, earlier this year.

The footage was posted online and went viral and his violence enraged people so much that an angry mob turned up on his doorstep and forced him to flee with his family from his home in Grimsby to London.

Bloomfield was banned at Grimsby magistrates' court from keeping dogs for 15 years after admitting two counts of animal cruelty, but now claims he 'should be compensated for the invasion of privacy'.

The 37-year-old said he felt sorry for what he did but added: 'If my neighbour had concerns, he should have got in touch with the RSPCA, not made videos of my family and put them on Facebook and YouTube.

'I will be seeking the advice of a solicitor and should be compensated for the invasion of privacy which has left my family homeless and denied my young son a better future.'

The court heard how Bloomfield claimed that he punched the dog because it had bitten his three-year-old son's hand when taking a packet of crisps from him.

He also claimed he was stressed from work and was 'sick of the dog barking'.

Bloomfield said: 'I heard my son crying and he was holding his hand, saying the dog bit him. I was angry so I went out and bashed him.

'It is not in my nature to be cruel to animals and I know it was not the best way to go about things but I was upset.'

Bloomfield claims to be an animal lover and insisted that his neighbours didn't like his family because they were from London.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The video, shot from a neighbour's window, shows Butch being kicked,
punched in the face and repeatedly hit in Grimsby, north-east Lincolnshire

During the court case, magistrates 
were warned the footage - filmed between September 9 and October 18 - 
contained 'disturbing' images.

It shows Butch at the back door whimpering to 
be let inside the house and then being beaten twice with a 
pole by Bloomfield.

In a
separate shot, Butch is then seen standing outside the door whining when it is flung open and he flinches in fear.

Bloomfield grabs Butch by his neck before punching him in the head and kicking him while a small boy stands
behind him, seemingly egging him on. Right, a woman in a bra and trousers with a towel on her head opens the door and appears to whip the dog with a cloth

As Butch cowers in terror, a pole is brandished at him from the doorway of the property. The Staffordshire bull terrier was taken to Grimsby Blue Cross Animal Hospital to be checked over and the RSPCA took hundreds of calls

Next, a woman in a bra and trousers with a towel on her head opens the door and
allegedly whips the dog with a cloth before slamming the door. 

One shot shows the dog eventually being allowed into the house, but
not before it cowers in terror.

Finally, the most disturbing piece of footage shows Bloomfield seemingly grabbing Butch by his neck before punching the dog twice in the head and kicking him. A small boy appears
behind Bloomfield, apparently egging him on. 

Bloomfield can be heard shouting 
'shut the f**k up'.

Bloomfield was arrested on October 18 after his neighbour Michael Currie posted the video on Facebook.

Bloomfield continued: 'Neighbours didn't like us because we are from London.

'They would come round complaining that the dog was making a noise and then film me when I smacked him.'

Bloomfield
also kept lizards, a bird and a fish - but has since got rid of them 
because he 'genuinely thought' he was going to prison.

He
added: 'I plan to replace the lizards but after everything that has 
happened, I will never keep a dog again - even after the 15-year ban is 
up.

'We are now living with my mother in London.

'My son has had to leave the nursery he went to and the friends he made. We lost everything we loved in the space of an hour.

'I have lost my house over this and it is wrong.'

Butch
was taken into the care of the RSPCA.

Mr Bloomfield was also ordered to
complete 260 hours of unpaid work and pay £100 costs.
