As England basked in the match-winning batting of Joe Root and James Taylor in Pallekele, it was easy to forget that the platform for their run-chase had been laid the day before by Chris Woakes.

His spell of five for 19 in 2.5 overs at the end of the Sri Lankan innings on Wednesday had limited the hosts to 239 – a target England knocked off with five balls to spare to close the gap in this seven-match series to 3-2. On Saturday they have the chance to draw level.

Woakes finished with six for 48, and now possesses two of the three six-wicket hauls in England’s one-day history. But his contribution goes beyond the record books: as much as anything, he embodies the spirit of a team that, against the odds, is beginning to believe in itself.

England’s one-day side still has its problems, of course, and defeat on Saturday would add yet another series loss to the ledger.

But there are reasons for optimism too. Moeen Ali has confirmed his explosive potential as an opener, Taylor has slotted in expertly at No 3, and Root has now made three match-winning hundreds this year alone.

Jos Buttler finished off the run-chase in Hambantota, while James Tredwell has confirmed himself as the team’s spin-bowling banker. Chris Jordan’s control has improved as the series has gone on.

The form of Woakes, though, is as promising as anything. His 12 scalps at 19 apiece make him the leading wicket-taker in the series on either side, three clear of Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis. The next-best seamer is Jordan, on just six. Steven Finn’s Woakes’s new-ball partner, has collected only three.

With James Anderson and Stuart Broad set to return from injury in time for the World Cup, and Finn still capable of improvement, England are building a useful stock of seamers ahead of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand – so much so that someone may have to miss out.

‘It’s always at the back of your mind,’ said Woakes. ‘With Jimmy and Broady not being here it has given some of the guys, particularly myself, the opportunity to put our hand up and show the management and coaches what we can do.

‘It’s been good for me, because I have been bowling in some tough conditions. It has been good experience, good exposure and the more you play at international level the better you get.’

Back at The Oval in August 2013, Woakes was winning his first Test cap against Australia. If Shane Watson and Steve Smith made him look a touch pedestrian, he has since added a yard of pace.

It is a process he attributes to three coaches: Graeme Welch at Warwickshire, Kevin Shine at the ECB Academy in Loughborough, and England’s own David Saker, whom Woakes credits with sorting out a ‘slight technical issue’ with his front arm.

As if to underline the point, Woakes played in the three Tests England won against India in the summer. And if his figures were unremarkable – five wickets at 43 – then his endeavour deserved better.

Woakes said: ‘I feel it was maybe a bit of a turning point. It has been nice to be on this tour and get a run of games and show people what I can do.’

More heroics on Saturday and those people may need convincing no longer.
