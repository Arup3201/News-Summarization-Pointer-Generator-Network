Launching her attack: Jill Kelley is now suing three government agencies and a number of officials demanding an apology for bringing her into the Petraeus scandal

Florida socialite Jill Kelley has launched a fight against the government in an effort to salvage her reputation in the wake of the scandal that brought down the head of the CIA and led to the retirement of a second four-star general.

Last year, Mrs Kelley became a secondary participant in then-CIA director David Petraeus’ affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell after Mrs Kelley contacted the FBI about threatening emails she received from Broadwell. During an ensuing search of her email records, the FBI publicly announced that she had ‘inappropriate’ email conversations with General John Allen as well.

Petraeus stepped down from his position at the CIA over his affair, General Allen retired, and Broadwell went into hiding. Mrs Kelley also went into hiding, but now she has spoken out about how she feels it was unjust for her to be seemingly forced into a defensive position even though she believes she did nothing wrong.

‘Just because you’re stalked by a mistress doesn’t mean you are one… It’s not contagious,’ she said in an interview with The New York Times.

All of the parties involved in the tumultuous scandal- Petraeus, Broadwell, Allen and Kelley- were all married to other people, but Kelley claims that Petraeus and Broadwell were the only two that had a romantic relationship.

Mrs Kelley, with her cancer surgeon husband Mark at her side, is fighting back against the federal government for releasing her name in connection to the Broadwell investigation and further insinuating an inappropriate connection to General Allen.

Heart of the matter: In 2012, it was revealed that former General David Petraeus, who was the then-CIA director, had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell (seen together in 2011)

Sending messages? Paula Broadwell sent Jill Kelley threatening emails while having an affair with David Petraeus and posted a cryptic Twitter message today (right) shortly after Kelley's interview was posted

At the time, an unidentified law 
enforcement official said that Mrs Kelley’s hundreds emails with General
 Allen were ‘sexually explicit’ but she claimed that the most salacious 
remark in any of their conversations was that the Virginia-bred General 
called her ‘a sweetheart’ on a number of occasions.

‘I saw the emails… I knew it was complete nonsense,’ Dr Kelley told The Times.

Mrs Kelley has a number of problems with the whole situation- starting with the fact that the FBI and other government agencies looked through her emails in the first place, then the fact that they released her name to the public. She also now takes issue with the fact that they will not allow her to publicly release those emails in an effort to defend herself as she believes that they will help rehabilitate her reputation.

‘I am still suffering the consequences from the bad acts and false and untrue headlines. They created a sideshow at my expense,’ Mrs Kelley said.

Big wigs: John Allen (right), who- like Petraeus (center right)- was a four-star general, also became looped in the scandal because investigators found 'inappropriate' emails between Allen and Jill Kelley

All friends: Jill Kelley and her husband Mark (center) hosted a number of parties in Tampa when David Petraeus (left) and his wife Holly (right) were stationed there in 2010 and the couples became friends

She argues that the exposure has 
prevented her from moving past the scandal, saying that she still cannot
 go out publicly to get groceries or attend her children’s Christmas 
pageants.

The scandal’s other participants have 
all made slow entrances back to public life. General Petraeus is 
teaching at three different universities and General Allen has become a 
counsel to Secretary of State John Kerry.

Even
 Paula Broadwell is back on the speaker’s circuit, lending her name to 
charitable causes supporting wounded veterans and getting involved in 
community events in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Though
 she mostly leaves her public remarks to moments behind podiums at 
charity events, Mrs Broadwell posted a rare and rather cryptic tweet 
this morning, just hours after Mrs Kelley’s New York Times interview 
went live.

Sticking by one another: Mark Kelley said that he saw all of the emails that the government called 'sexually explicit' and was fine with them all, as she said the most salacious inclusion was the word 'sweetheart'

Hosts: The Kelleys were figures on Tampa's military-heavy social scene but since the scandal, they say they are forced to rarely leave their house

She posted a picture of a Nelson Mandela quote, but given the substance of the matter, it seems like it may be another virtual attack on Mrs Kelley: ‘As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I'd still be in prison.’

Mrs Kelley is sticking to clear public and legal wrangling in an effort to clear her name, suing three federal agencies and a number of FBI and Pentagon officials who she claims violated her privacy by searching her email and releasing her name.

‘People don’t understand what I went through,’ she told The Times.
