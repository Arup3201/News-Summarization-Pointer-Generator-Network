Atlanta police are being accused of embellishing the case against a father whose son died in a hot car last month after significant discrepancies allegedly emerged during a review of the evidence.

The Atlanta Journal Constitution has carefully looked through some the evidence, including a surveillance video that captured Justin Ross Harris outside the Home Depot where he worked, and the newspaper claims authorities overstated some of their case at a July 3 hearing.

According to the AJC, the tape contradicts some of the testimony given by Cobb County detective Phil Stoddard.

Also, in an exclusive interview, Harris' brother told the paper that he and Harris were planning a cruise together and that Harris had specifically requested one with facilities for children.

Family: The Atlanta Journal Constitution claims there are discrepancies int he evidence in the case of Justin Ross Harris, pictured right with his wife and late son Cooper

During the July 3 hearing, Stoddard, prompted by prosecutor Chuck Boring, strongly insinuated that Harris sat in his parked car outside of his work on the morning on June 18 for 30 seconds before getting out and walking inside.

Boring reiterated this during closing arguments, saying 'That morning, he waits 30 seconds in that car... 30 seconds with that child right beside him.'

However, the AJC claims the security video in fact shows Harris remained in the Hyundai for less that 15 seconds before exiting the car, during which time he put the car in park, turned off the engine and gathered his belongings.

Harris returned to the SUV at lunchtime to put a package of light bulbs inside and Stoddard. During the brief trip to the car, Stoddard and Boring said the father had a 'clear view' of the inside of the car.

However, after reviewing the video, the AJC claims only Harris' arm and shoulder are seen reaching inside the vehicle, and that his eyes remain above the SUV's roof at all times. It also shows it took just three seconds for him to open the door, put the package inside and shut the door again.

The third piece of allegedly overstated evidence presented by authorities is the claim that Harris paused during
 his walk back to the office, because he apparently was concerned a 
passerby would see his son inside the car.

While
 the tape does show Harris pass a man in the parking lot, and pause 
briefly, his eyes are on his cell phone, which he is poking at with his 
free hand and he doesn't appear to notice the man at all.

The man in fact walks the length of 
Harris' parked car and would have almost certainly seen the child if 
he'd turned his head, the AJC claims.

Michael
 Baygents, Harris' half-brother, told the newspaper that he and Harris 
were excitedly planning to take their families on a cruise in October 
after Harris suggested the two families vacation together.

He said they settled on Carnival Cruise Lines because a carnival ship had water slides for children.

Baygents said he was frustrated to see the way the police were portraying his brother's case.

'I'm
 very angry with them. I think they rushed to judgment. I think Stoddard
 rushed to judgment. I think he made a terrible mistake,' he told the 
AJC.

The claims come after the lawyer for the Harris' wife said she was devastated by the loss of little Cooper.

Peaceful: Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his 
eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He 
allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look'

Criminal defense attorney Lawrence 
Zimmerman said Leanna Harris is 'living every parent's nightmare' after 
the death of her 22-month-old son.

The woman's husband, Justin Ross Harris, 33, was arrested on charges of murder and child cruelty after the boy's death June 18.

The
 father told police he left his son in the backseat of his SUV for about
 seven hours after forgetting to drop him off at day care and going to 
work, investigators in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County have said.

Leanna Harris has not been charged in the case.

Zimmerman criticized media coverage of
 her reaction to her son's death, saying speculation over a perceived 
lack of emotion in the case thus far is similar to what 1996 Olympic 
bombing hero Richard Jewell faced after an attack that year on the 
summer games in Atlanta.

Jewell led people away from a suspicious backpack before a blast killed one and left more than 100 people injured.

He
 became the target of intense scrutiny after an unattributed news report
 said he was the focus of the investigation into the attack.

Jewell's name was cleared in 2006 and he died the following year at age 44.

'Newspapers,
 television and online media have fostered a poisonous atmosphere in 
which Leanna's every word, action and emotion — or failure to cry in 
front of a crowd — is scrutinized for some supposed hidden meaning,' Zimmerman said.

He
 added that the media has dug into his client's upbringing, marriage and
 sex life. Zimmerman also said Leanna Harris has been unable to return 
to work and she's asking to be allowed to mourn her son out of the 
public eye.

'She will never be able to tuck him into bed at night and return later to check on him.

'She
 mourns Cooper's death deeply, in her own private way,' the lawyer 
stated. 'She takes comfort from a strong faith in God, but the loss is 
still overwhelming. Getting through each day seems almost impossible.'

During
 an hourslong probable cause hearing on July 3, prosecutors said 
evidence shows Justin Ross Harris had been leading a double life and was
 sending nude photos with several women — including at least one 
teenager — even on the day his son died.

The
 couple had two life insurance policies for the toddler, one for $2,000 
and one for $25,000. After his son's death, Harris talked with relatives
 about what they needed to do to file claims, investigators have said.

Harris'
 defense attorney Maddox Kilgore has argued that evidence in the case is
 insufficient and the boy's death was a tragic accident. Justin Ross Harris remains jailed without bond.

Police recently said a 
toxicology tests on the body of 22-month-old Cooper had negative 
results, but they didn't say what substances they tested for.

Toxicology tests typically are used to detect foreign substances such as drugs in a person's system.

A
 growing number of questions are being asked about Leanna Harris' 
unusual behavior in the wake of young Cooper’s horrific death inside a 
sweltering SUV last month.

Harris,
 a 30-year-old dietitian, expressed little emotion throughout her 
husband's preliminary hearing last week, despite a number of shocking 
allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six 
different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed 
away.

As
 prosecutors said her husband was practically leading a double life and 
should not be granted bond, Leanna Harris chewed gum and stared blankly 
ahead.

During last Thursday's proceedings, investigators described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious.

When informed by workers at her son's 
day care facility that Cooper had never been dropped off, she calmly 
responded, 'Ross must have left him in the car. There's no other 
explanation,' according to Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard's 
testimony.

Then, when 
reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been 
charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him, 'Did you say too much?' 
according to Stoddard.

When she called home June 18 with the 
grim news of Cooper's death, her mother could be overheard on the phone 
saying: 'Why aren't you crying? Why aren't you reacting?'

Her response, according to Stoddard: 'I must be in shock.'

Police
 had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched 
children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper's death, telling 
officers it was her 'worst fear.'

At Cooper's funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him.

'Ross
 is and was a wonderful father,' she told mourners, before telling her 
husband of seven years: 'I love you and I'm doing this for you.'

Some of Leanna Harris' comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions.

'Some of you might wonder how I'm standing here today and I ask myself the same question,' the deeply religious mother said.

'I should be crumpled into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing behind me, holding me up.'

The
 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her
 two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, 
even if she could.

'He's in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is.'

Justin Ross Harris was denied bond by a judge who called it a 'possible death penalty case.'

He remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges and prosecutors may seek to use Leanna Harris as a witness.

In
 Georgia, the spousal privilege shielding a wife from testifying against
 her husband, doesn't apply in cases of the death of a child.
