Masaki Kitamura suffered a terrifying ordeal after Japanese police arrested him for posting death threats from his computer.

The chilling postings and emails, which were traced to Mr Kitamura’s computer, threatened mass murder in Osaka and claimed there was a bomb on a Japan Airlines flight to New York.

But weeks after the animation director was arrested and charged, despite protesting his innocence, police realised Mr Kitamura was a victim of a ‘zombie’ computer hacker, according to The Times.

Threats: An unidentified hacker sent emails and postings threatening to bomb a Japan Airlines flight and attack the city of Osaka from Masaki Kitamura's computer

His computer had been taken over by an unidentified hacker who proceeded to send threatening emails and postings online.

In August, just days before the threats began to appear, Mr Kitamura had downloaded some free software from the internet.

Two days later, a posting appeared on a bulletin board with a threat to drive a truck into pedestrians in Osaka and then attack them with a knife.

Tasteless: Another threat said an attack would occur at the school attended by Prince Hisahito, centre, the six-year-old grandson of Emperor Akihito

Three days after the first threat was posted, a plane was forced to return to Tokyo after a threat had been emailed claiming a bomb was on board the aircraft as it travelled to New York.

The police traced the threats through Internet Protocol (IP) to Mr Kitamura’s computer and promptly arrested him.

The authorities were also investigating more threats in Mie Prefecture, where someone had posted online that they would attack workers at video game manufacturer Nintendo and people visiting the Ise Grand Shrine.

Again the police traced the IP address and arrested the owner of the computer who, like Mr Kitamura, protested his innocence.

Investigators discovered signs that his computer was infected with a Trojan horse virus after they inspected the machine.

Further threats were made to bomb a school attended by Emperor Akihito’s six-year-old grandson, Prince Hisahito.

A man in Fukuoka was arrested and confessed because he believed his girlfriend had posted the message and he wanted to protect her.

The unknown perpetrator appears to be revelling in the police’s failure to apprehend the hacker, and yesterday a Japanese newspaper printed extracts of a gloating email he had sent.

The email listed the names of 12 people whose computers had been hacked, before concluding: ‘Thank you for playing with me. Let’s play again.’

‘Zombie’ hackers take control of other computers by implanting a daemon, often by tricking the computer owner to download some software online.

The hacker can then send commands to the infected computer from other locations.

Computer hacking has enabled a range of criminal and mischievous activity worldwide. 

As well as the postings of death threats or abusive comments, hackers have been known to steal money and people's identities, and in other cases hackers will promote a political agenda.

The group Anonymous, the world's largest hacking group have taken responsibility for attacks on the Pentagon, News Corp and threatened to destroy social networking site Facebook in the past.

Most recently though, they named a man allegedly responsible for the suicide of 15-year-old Canadian girl, Amanda Todd, in a vigilante move.

Other hackers work while on the move and log on to people's internet connections from outside their homes to gain access to private information or download illegal material from another IP address.

Other online fraudsters hack email accounts, and send messages asking for financial help.

Revealed: In a YouTube video, Anonymous claimed that the man behind the bullying of Amanda Todd, 15, who was found hanged, was a 32-year-old man from British Columbia

Suicide: Todd was found hanged in her home on October 10 - just one month before her 16th birthday

In one such incident in 2009, former Justice Minister Jack Straw was targeted by Nigerian fraudsters.

They logged on to the MP's email account and sent more than 200 emails asking for money, claiming Mr Straw had lost his wallet while doing charity work in Africa.

Briton Gary McKinnon yesterday avoided extradition to the U.S. after Home Secretary Theresa May blocked the move.

He allegedly hacked Pentagon computers from his home in north London and has battled against extradition to face trial in the U.S. for more than ten years.

Mrs May blocked the move on health grounds.
