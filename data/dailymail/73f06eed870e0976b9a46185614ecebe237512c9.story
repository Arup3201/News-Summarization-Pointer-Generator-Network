A first-time mother has given birth to an 11lb 6oz baby without a Caesarean section.

Joleen Adamson, 29, gave birth to Theo after more than 36 hours in labour.

Theo, who was born ten days after his due date, was so big that more than 20 members of staff at Maelor Hospital in Wrexham, North Wales, gathered to see him weighed.

Joleen Adamson, 29, gave birth to Theo without a Caesarean even though he weighed 11lb 6oz. He was born ten days late but none of Mrs Adamson's scans or assessments revealed that he was so big

Theo is only one-week-old but his newborn clothes are already proving to be too small – he requires clothes designed for babies aged three to six-months.

Mrs Adamson, who works in a fish and chip shop, said: ‘It was quite difficult and I was really struggling towards the end.

‘I pushed for hours and he didn’t budge. At one stage I was close to passing out.

‘There were about 20 people in the room when Theo was weighed and some of them said it was the biggest baby they had seen.

‘I wasn’t told he was going to be a big baby!’

During pregnancy Mrs Adamson, who is married to 42-year-old Lee, had two scans and routine checks by midwives, and no sign of Theo’s size was detected.

Mrs Adamson (pictured with Theo and her husband, Lee, 42) was in labour for more than 36 hours and lost so much blood that she had to have three blood transfusions

Because of Theo’s size, she lost a lot of blood and needed three blood transfusions.

However, both mother and baby are now doing well at their home in Chirk, which sits right on the border between Wales and Shropshire.

‘He’s at home now and settling in very well,’ Mrs Adamson said. ‘Theo is a very contented baby.

‘Theo is my first baby. I didn’t have any food cravings while I was pregnant or eat anything unusual.

‘He loves to relax in his crib, although when he starts to feel hungry he has a good set of lungs on him to let us know.’
