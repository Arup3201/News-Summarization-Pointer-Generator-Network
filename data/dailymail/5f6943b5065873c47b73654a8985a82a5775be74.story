West Brom are close to agreeing a £2million deal to sign winger Sebastian Blanco from Metalist Kharkiv.

Leicester, Aston Villa and Everton have all shown an interest in the Argentine who is refusing to return to the Ukraine following unrest in the country.

Target: West Brom are close to agreeing a £2million deal to sign winger Sebastian Blanco

Blanco is expected in England on Friday for a medical ahead of becoming Alan Irvine's 11th signing since arriving at the Hawthorns in June.

Irvine said on Thursday he was keen to sign one more player to complete his squad and he wants to avoid a deadline day scramble.

He said: 'We have a few plates spinning at the moment. If you pin all your hopes on one player and that one goes wrong where do you turn?

'You have got to make sure there are other options. We have a preferred choice but that might not be the one which happens.

'I'm hoping all of our work will be done by Monday so I can sit back and see what unfolds.

"We lost 13 players so straight away it meant we were going to have to bring in big numbers so it was clear it was going to be a big job in terms of creating a new squad.'
