A two-year-old boy is in critical condition after his mother accidentally ran over his leg with a lawnmower.

Maria Isabel Huerto Bello, 23, was mowing their yard in Lake Placid, Florida on Wednesday as her son, Anthony Meza, was riding his bike, police have said.

But when she put the lawn mower in reverse, she hit the boy.

'Right now, all the evidence points that this was an accident,' Nell Hays, public information officer with the Highlands County Sheriff's Office told FoxNews.com.

The child was rushed to Florida Hospital Lake Placid's emergency room at 10am on Wednesday and has undergone surgery at Tampa General Hospital.

He has suffered serious injuries to his leg and may need more surgery today but a final determination has not yet been made, hospital officials said.

He remains in critical yet stable condition in the pediatric intensive care unit.

After the boy was taken to hospital, staff notified the Special Victims Unit at around 3pm, police said.

The incident is just the latest involving a lawnmower accident and children in Florida this year.

In April, Ireland Nugent lost both legs below the knees when her father accidentally reversed over her as he drove the lawnmower at their home.

She has now been fitted with prosthetics and her family is collecting donations on a fundraising page.

In July, a four-year-old from Hardee County lost part of her right foot when her father backed over her on a lawn mower as she played with her eight-year-old sister at their home.
