Brightly coloured graffiti scribbles and murals are usually found on grotty inner-city buildings.

But thanks to a new internet sensation which sees graffiti-clad girls uploaded revealing shots of themselves, this is one street art trend that has broken out of the mould.

And unlike the illegal vandalism, Graffiti On Girls has become an internet hit, with cheeky street-style art added to women's bodies and the photographs uploaded for all to admire.

The 'graffiti on girls' trend requires either a friend or boyfriend to do the artwork while the female exposes her flesh. Some girls also put tags on themselves, but can't get into hard to reach places such as their back.

Water-based markers like those for outside are used to add the attractive design in a range of colours across the girls' legs or torso.

Vince added: 'The comment that comes up most often on is : "My two favourites things at one place : Girls & Graffiti".

Only girl allowed: Men are most definitely not allowed to feature on the site which sees models daubed with brightly coloured tags and murals

Favourite things: Men on the site often comment praising the girls and their graffiti, which they dub their 'two favourite things'

'Graffiti on girls is exclusively for girls, so that means no body art and definitely no guys.

'There are thousands of pictures online of sexy girls painted by graffiti writers with real style. But we get just as many from girls that are simply too rude, and we've had to reject them.

'Most graffiti artist like to paint on their girlfriends, but it hasn't been until recently thanks to the internet that its become a real art form.'

The website has just released a calender featuring models with graffiti on their bodies which is available at shriiimp.com.
