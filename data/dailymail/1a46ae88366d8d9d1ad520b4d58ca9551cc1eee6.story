Google is under fresh pressure from the European Union to expand its controversial 'right to be forgotten' tool.

The service, which is currently only available in Europe, removes links to websites with content that is ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant'.

EU data protection watchdogs want to make the service global to prevent the law from being circumvented when a legitimate request is made.

Google is under fresh pressure from the European Union to expand its controversial 'right to be forgotten' service. The service, which is currently only available on Europe, removes links to websites that include content that is ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant'

'From the legal and technical analysis we are doing, they
should include the ".com",' said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, the
head of France's privacy watchdog.

A Google spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We haven't yet seen the Article 29 Working Party's guidelines, but we will study them carefully when they're published.'

The company previously said search results
should be removed only from its European versions since Google
automatically redirects people to the local versions of its
search engine.

However, a link is provided at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen allowing the users to switch to the international .com version.

The data watchdogs said this 'cannot be considered a sufficient means to guarantee the rights' of citizens living in the union's 28 member countries.

MailOnline has received a number of notifications requesting removal of links. The removal request includes a note to say 'in many cases, the affected queries do not relate to the name of any person mentioned'

So far the search engine has received more than 174,000 requests concerning more than 602,000 links. The company claims it has removed 41.5 per cent of these links.

Examples include a series of MailOnline articles detailing issues ranging from drug abuse to incest, murder and spying.

How do you request to remove a link? 

Those seeking to have information about them removed can visit the legal section of Google's website. On this page, a form allows users to put in a search removal request under EU data law.

Who can use the form?

Only EU citizens are allowed to submit a request via the form and apply to have their links removed if their legal name appears. They will have to explain why the link should be taken down.

Which requests will be considered?

All requests will be considered but Google, but it will have to balance privacy with the public interest, the company has said it will not remove all cases.

What can I do if a case is not resolved?

In Britain users can contact the Information Commissioner's Office or take Google to court. 

For instance, MailOnline received a request to remove a May 2009 article describing the sordid captivity in which Josef Fritzl kept his family. 

The piece was based on extracts from the book ‘The Crimes of Josef Fritzl: Uncovering the Truth’. Publisher Harper Collins told MailOnline at the time it did not know who sent the request

Other MailOnline stories removed from Google results include claims from April 2013 that a ten-year-old girl could have died if her parents had relied on the NHS 111 helpline.

More recently, Google removed a MailOnline story about a teenager, Kyle Ivison, slapped with an Asbo for committing 40 per cent of the offences in his town. 

The issue of how far to push the 'right to be forgotten' has
divided experts and privacy regulators. 

Some argue that
Google's current approach waters down the effectiveness of the
ruling, given how easy it is to switch between different
national versions.

Yesterday's decision was another setback for Google, which
is facing multiple investigations into its privacy policy and is
mired in a four-year EU anti-trust inquiry.

The ruling has pitted privacy advocates against free speech
campaigners, who say allowing people to ask search engines to
remove information would lead to a whitewashing of the past.

MailOnline publisher Martin Clarke has described the move by the search engine as 'the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you don't like'. 

Ms Pierrotin said that notifying publishers and media
outlets when their stories are de-listed from search results
would not be mandatory, as Google has previously argued.

'There is no legal basis for routine transmission from
Google or any other search engine to the editors. It may in some
cases be necessary, but not as a routine and not as an
obligation,' she said.

Google's decision to notify press outlets and webmasters via
email was criticised by regulators earlier this year for
sometimes bringing people's names back into the open.

Last year, the foundation which operates Wikipedia described the rule as 'unforgivable censorship'.

Speaking at the announcement of the Wikimedia Foundation's first-ever transparency report in London, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said the public had the 'right to remember'.

‘We are on a path to secret, online sanitation of truthful information,’ said Geoff Brigham, general counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation.

‘No matter how well it may be intended, it is compromising human rights, the freedom of expression and access to information, and we cannot forget that.

‘So we have to expose it and we have to reject this kind of censorship.’
