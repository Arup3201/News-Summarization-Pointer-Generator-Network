Tragic: Peyton Barbour, 16, was shot dead by police on Christmas Day after leading them on a high-speed chase in a stolen car

Troubled teen: Peyton Cole Barbour, 16, was a student at Mansfield Lake Ridge High School in Mansfield, Texas

The shocking incident began about 4.30am Wednesday when an officer tried to stop the vehicle the teen was driving near North Grand Peninsula Drive and England Parkway in Grand Prairie because of suspicious activity.

Barbour sped away in the stolen 1997 Honda, leading officers on a high-speed pursuit.

The armed teenager then dumped the car in a field, firing a stolen Glock 9-mm pistol at the officers as he ran into a wooded area, The Dallas Morning News reported.

For about 10 hours, police officers, a K-9 unit and a police helicopter searched the area from Grand Peninsula to Lynn Creek Marina for Barbour, NBC 5 reported.

About 2pm, police officers swarmed the 600 block of Seeton Road after residents reported suspicious activity.

That's when cops cornered Barbour and the teen exchanged gunfire with officers.

Two cops suffered bullet wounds, but their injuries were not life-threatening.

Barbour was struck by gunfire before being rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital where he died.

On camera: Witness Tammy King captured the gunshots outside her home on her cell phone

Witness Tammy King captured the violent exchange on her cell phone.

She said she locked eyes with the teen as he walked right by her driveway right before the shootout. 

'I kind of got nervous, pulled in the drive and locked the door,' she told KHOU.com. 

Barbour’s father, Oscar, is an assistant principal at Nash Elementary School in Mansfield, according to the school’s website.

The website also shows that his mother, Dawn, works as a receptionist at Cross Timbers Intermediate School.

Dawn Barbour told NBC she and her husband saw their son on Christmas morning, but there was no indication anything was wrong.

'This isn’t him, it was so out of character, didn’t see it coming,' she said.

'I do want to say to the officers that were injured, I'm so sorry, I apologize, you know that he did this. We don't know, we really don't, there are so many questions it hit us like a ton of bricks, out of nowhere.'

Police yesterday were still trying to determine how Barbour obtained a Glock 9-mm pistol which been reported stolen in a home burglary.

The boy's school yesterday released a brief statement saying that officials were 'shocked and saddened' by the news but thankful the wounded officers were recovering.

Barbour’s friends said the shootout was completely out of character because he never talked about guns or indicated he had one.

Trevor Stutsman told KHOU.com Barbour had made some 'stupid decisions' in the past, but 'he was a great kid'.

Family and friends laid flowers and personal notes on the hood of Barbour’s red Chevrolet I-Roc Z Camaro which was parked outside his house.
