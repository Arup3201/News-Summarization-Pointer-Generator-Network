A coastal timber chalet with a guide price of £25,000 has sold for 10 times as much after its panoramic sea views sparked a bidding war.

The chalet, near Penzance, Cornwall was originally built in the 1940s and does not currently have mains electricity.

But it does boast stunning sea views across the headlands on to Mount Bay in Cornwall.

The property doesn't have any mains electricity but does have a kitchenette, small living room, a bedroom and a garden

The property also has a galley style kitchenette, and a second room with an open fireplace as well as a bedroom while outside it has a garden and outbuilding.

The West Country pad, which has been owned by the same family since it was built, was put up for auction on Tuesday.

It was offered as the last lot of the auction in Exeter, Devon, with a guide price of just £25,000.

But there was a bidding frenzy from interested parties at the auction with the final bid hitting a staggering £235,000 - ten times the guide.

It is thought that the panoramic sea views sparked the bidding war at auction, with the property eventually going for £235,000

Andrew Jarrold, associate director and auctioneer at Countrywide, said: 'There was euphoria in the sale room, everyone was clapping.

'We were delighted with the result which was fantastic for the client.

'It was a unique, unrivalled opportunity and there were a dozen or so interested in bidding.

'That is the power of an auction - it lets the market decided the value.'
