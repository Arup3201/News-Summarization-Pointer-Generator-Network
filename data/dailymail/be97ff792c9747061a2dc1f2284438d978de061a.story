Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch’s paintings are packed full of vivid imagery and complex meanings.

And The Garden of Earthly Delights, which depicts the Biblical narrative of creation, heaven and hell is one of his most intricate.

So it may come as no surprise that not one person had tried to play a tiny piece of music tattooed on the bottom of a man languishing in hell in the triptych painting until now – 500 years after the work was created.

In the painting, a choir sings from the score inscribed on the man’s buttocks that have been described as ‘musician’s hell.’

A student called Amelia, who describes herself as ‘a hard of hearing music and information systems double major’ at Oklahoma Christian University is said to be the first person to play the hellish ditty.

She admitted she did not spend a long time playing the tune that is assumed to be in the key of C, which was a common choice for chants composed around 500 years ago and may feature the odd bum note.

'This is literally the 600-years-old butt song from hell,’ she wrote on Tumblr.

Amelia
 tapped it out on a piano, but it does sound quite melodic for a tune 
that is rumoured to be a chant that opens the gates of hell, according to Classicalite.

Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation.

The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is absent.

Cities are aflame, there are torture chambers, demons and mutated animals feeding on mangled humans.

Writer Walter S. Gibson said that explosions in the background are ‘turning the water below into blood’.

The foreground is populated by a variety of distressed or tortured figures.

Some are crucified by harps and lutes to sharpen the contrast between pleasure and torture.

The ‘tree man’ has three naked people in his hollow torso and the image is thought to suggest sexuality and lust, which in the Middle Ages were seen by some as humanity’s fall from grace and the deadliest of sins.

However, Amelia wrote on her blog: ‘Just wanted to let people know that there are indeed errors in the transcription and this is indeed not a very good recording (I threw this together in 30 minutes at one in the morning,) but I’m working with the music department at my college to get the transcription more accurate!’

Bosch painted his three part masterpiece between 1490 and 1510 when he was around 50 years old. It is his most famous work.

Art historians and critics have largely interpreted the painting as a warning on the perils of life's temptations, but there have been other strange interpretations over the centuries as to what it could all mean.

Hell is the setting for a number of Bosch’s paintings and in this one, humans have succumbed to the temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation.

The picture is a chilling one and humans are warring and held in torture chambers, pursued by demons and feasted on by mutated animals that feed on human flesh.

Interestingly some of the tortured souls trapped in hell are shown to be crucified by harps and lutes so that the music of the underworld is the opposite of that on Earth and certainly in heaven.
