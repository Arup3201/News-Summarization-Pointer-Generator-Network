Mystery continues to surround the disappearance of a young Kansas City woman who left her home one night in February and was found dead eight days later in a well behind a locked gate in a remote part of a city park.

New surveillance footage has now emerged of her the night after her disappearance. 

Janina Vasquez, 27, known to loved ones as Nina, left the home she shares with her mother, Jennie Cochran, and stepfather in Overland Park, Missouri, on the night of February 11.

At 10 p.m. that night she texted her stepfather and told him that she was going to stay the night with 'Allen and Nicole' and would be back the next day.

The first mystery is the identity of Allen and Nicole – Vasquez’s mother had not heard of them before.

Surveillance footage released by the Kansas City Police Department shows Janina Vasquez at the Isle of Capri Casino on February 12. She left the casino at 7:40 p.m. in a red car with an unknown driver

The following day Vasquez was seen on the new surveillance footage leaving the Isle of Capri Casino at approximately 7:40 p.m.

Detectives say she got into a red car driven by an unknown person, and they want to speak with that driver or anyone who saw her get into the car.

No one saw or heard from Vasquez again until the discovery of her body in a 25 feet deep flood control well at Richard Berkley Riverfront Park  on February 19.

The park is immediately next to the casino on the banks of the Missouri River and a heritage trail links the two.

She was found wearing the gray Victoria Secret sweatsuit she was last seen in, but the jacket was tied around her waist despite the weather being so cold during the eight days she was missing.

Her cell phone was in one of her burgundy boots and her ID was found in the other, but her bra, underwear and socks, and the burgundy North Face backpack she was carrying are all missing.

The park itself is one mile from where her cell phone last pinged a signal tower, on February 12 – at the intersection of Third and Cherry streets, approximately a mile and a half from the casino.

The well where Vasquez's body was found is in a remote part of the Richard Berkley Riverfront Park on the Missouri River a short walk from the casino

Vasquez was found with a severe injury to the back of her head that would have killed her almost instantly. Both of her wrists were also fractured.

Added to the mystery is that Vasquez suffered from seizures and post-traumatic stress disorder and took several pain and anxiety medications at the time of her death. She therefore does not drive and could not have walked to the park.

Someone had to have picked her up.

It also would have been close to impossible for Vasquez to get inside the security fence that surrounds the well, let alone lift the heavy grate on top of it.

Vasquez is described as creative, a hippie-type that named her dog Ziggy Marley, and who would paint to help relieve her health issues.

‘It’s been a nightmare; just that area and knowing that she was cold and frozen and alone,’ Cochran told Fox 4. ‘Obviously she got mixed up [with] somebody, something happened.’

‘Who was she with between February 11 and February 19 and why was she in that park? Who took her to the park? We’re not getting these answers,’ said Cochran.

Anyone with information can call the KCPD Homicide Unit at (816) 234-5043 or the TIPS Hotline at (816) 474-TIPS.

Police are appealing for information and Vasquez's mother is desperate to know who she was with between February 11 and February 19? Why was she in that park? Who took her to the park?
