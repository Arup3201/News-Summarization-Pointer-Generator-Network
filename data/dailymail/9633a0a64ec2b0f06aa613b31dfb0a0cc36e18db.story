A distraught widow discovered a digger had driven over her husband's grave and churned it up into a muddy mess - when she went to visit the cemetery on his birthday.

The family of Ian White, who died in 2009 from motor neurone disease aged just 47, were shocked to discover his grave at Sheppey Cemetery in Kent had been left covered in tyre marks after the council digger drove over it.

His two daughters had previously decorated the grave with a plaque and a number of trinkets and they had been saving up for a special headstone.

Mrs White, of Sheerness, Kent, said: 'They have moved his stuff so you can't even see there's a grave. There's tyre marks from the digger right the way across it'

But when widow Sharon, 49, visited it on what would have been Ian’s birthday she found council groundsmen had driven a digger over the plot and left tyre tracks in the turf as they dug a hole for a neighbouring grave.

Shocked Mrs White, of Sheerness, Kent, said: ‘They have moved his stuff so you can’t even see there’s a grave.

‘There’s tyre marks from the digger right the way across it.

‘They had put boards over the other graves nearby but not on his. I feel in shock and just numb.

‘My daughters were crying - my husband’s body is in there and I just can’t believe they drove over it like that.’

Daughter Hannah, 21, said: ‘There were sentimental things like ornaments which had been moved into two separate piles but not neatly and a couple of things were broken.

‘I’m devastated. It was just awful because of the lack of respect and the whole thing is insensitive and cruel.’

Sharon, a grandmother-of-three, tried to tidy the area over the weekend and even bought top soil and bricks to make it look presentable.

She says they confronted the groundsmen at the time but they failed to apologise or give any explanation as to why they had to drive over the grave.

Councillor David Simmons said: 'We have spoken to our contractors who carried out the work, and while the poor weather has contributed to the situation, we have made it clear this is unacceptable'

Swale Borough Council has now apologised to the family and promised to rectify it as soon as possible.

Councillor David Simmons, cabinet member for environment and rural affairs, said: ‘We sincerely apologise for the distress this has caused to the families involved.

‘We have spoken to our contractors who carried out the work, and while the poor weather has contributed to the situation, we have made it clear this is unacceptable.

‘Works will be undertaken to rectify the damage at the earliest opportunity.’
