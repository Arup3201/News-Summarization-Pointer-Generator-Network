An American mother-of-two who spent $15,000 to enhance the size of her hips and bottom says she's lucky to be alive after her 'obsession' could have killed her.

Vanity Wonder spoke to Eamon Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning today and admitted she was 'dumb' to go to extreme lengths to get a curvy posterior.

After showing pictures where Vanity looked 'bootilicious' before having hundreds of the illegal injections, Ruth asked the 30-year-old why she had wanted to change her body shape.

Regrets: Vanity Wonder appeared on This Morning to show Eamon Holmes and Ruth Langsford how injections and then silicone implants have left her with a disproportionately large bottom

Curvaceous: The 30-year-old told the amazed presenters she become obsessed with making her bum bigger when she worked as a dancer

'This size was not my goal': Vanity said the illegal injections gave her an infection which meant she had to have silicone implants so her bottom didn't look lumpy

Vanity admitted it had become an obsession as she felt she had to compete against other women in her job as a dancer.

She said: 'When I heard about butt injections I thought it sounded stupid but after a year in 
that environment as a dancer, everyone was doing it, it wasn't such a 
foreign concept. I thought I might as well try it.

'Then it became a competition - not for men but against other women. So
many of us were doing it because we wanted to better than the other 
person.'

Don't do it: Vanity wanted to share her story to warn other women against having illegal injections. She said she was lucky just to get an infection but other women have been killed as they didn't even know what they were being injected with

Vanity revealed each procedure involved at least nine injections in each cheek. She described how the injections felt like being struck by lightning and that they could often leak but this didn't deter her.

She admitted after the first treatment she didn't even know what she had been injected with.  'The first time I went for injections I 
didn't know what she used. She said it was soya bean oil but after 
doing my research, I don't believe her,' she said.

Vanity developed an infection as a result of the illegal injections but even this didn't make her stop having them. However, she explained it then meant she had to have silicone implants as the infection had left her bottom looking like 'a sack of oranges'.

She explained: 'It did become addictive but it got infected so I was left with lumps.
So I had a choice, I could have a medium-sized lumpy butt or keep padding it with silicone to
make it better. So it wasn't my goal to get this big but padding it 
with silicone is how this happened.'

Before: After seeing these pictures of Vanity before her injections, Ruth asked the mother-of-two why she wanted to change herself. She said it was thanks to competition with other women in her job as a dancer

Eamon asked Vanity to stand up from the This Morning sofa to reveal just how large her bottom is now.  'That's quite a curve,' he commented.

Vanity
admitted she isn't happy with her size but she has learnt to live with 
it because surgery to reverse it would be too risky. She added that in 
light of learning of women who have been killed after having the 
injections, she is now just happy to be alive.

She
said: 'Truthfully I would like smaller butt but I'm happy I didn't die 
and 
still here for my children. I did so much dumb stuff with my body I'm 
lucky that I'm still living. When I look in the mirror, I think I would 
like a smaller butt, it's hard to go shopping, but I'm just happy I'm 
still here.'

Standing in the corridor of the This Morning studios, Vanity shows how the hip injections have also altered her body shape

Vanity realises
that she has been one of the lucky ones after reading reports of women 
dying who had been injected with Fix-A-Flat tyre sealant and even 
cement.

She is also aware of
just how popular the injections are having worked as an assistant to a 
black market practitioner, who treated women 
as varied as a 17-year-old brought in by her proud mother and pensioner 
in her seventies.

It was
this job that gave her the wake-up call she needed to stop having the 
injections herself, as she was faced with jail for being involved in the
illegal practice.

Speaking out: Vanity hopes her experience will deter other women from having illegal butt injections

She said: 'Having the infection didn't make me stop. It was only when I was faced with jail and being away from my kids.'

Vanity
is no longer a dancer and hasn't had injections since May 2011. She now
says she wants to dedicate her life to warning others of the dangers of
having illegal injections.

She
has written a book, Shot Girls, which charts her own experience of 
having illegal injections and warns against following her example.

'I
wanted to tell the truth 100 per cent so people know what it really is.
You can get implants but injections made freely into your butt is not 
legal in any sense of the word,' she said.Â
