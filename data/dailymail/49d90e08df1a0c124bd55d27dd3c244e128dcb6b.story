Lance Armstrong underwent blood transfusions to boost his performance and took advantage of legal loopholes to cover up his doping, a former teammate has claimed in an explosive new book.

US Postal Service cyclist Tyler Hamilton, who rode with the now-disgraced cyclist between 1998 and 2001, has claimed dishonest techniques were rife throughout the team.

'To Lance's way of thinking, doping is a fact of life, like oxygen or gravity,' Hamilton said of Armstrong, who last week dropped his challenge to doping allegations, losing his seven Tour de France titles.

One technique was blood doping, where a 
rider would extract his blood in a bag and then re-inject it to boost the
red blood cell count, Hamilton claims in The Secret Race, which is out on Monday.

New claims: In a book released on Monday, Tyler Hamilton, left, has claimed his former team mate Lance Armstrong, right, would routinely take drugs and came up with ways to pass drugs tests

'With the other stuff, you swallow a pill or put on a patch or get a tiny
injection,' Hamilton wrote. 'But here you're watching a big clear 
plastic bag slowly fill up with your warm dark red blood. You never 
forget it.'

Hamilton added that, at the 1998 Tour, Armstrong's gardener, Phillipe, followed the riders on a motorbike carrying vials of the blood-boosting drug erythropoietin (EPO).

The team and Phillipe used prepaid cellphones to discreetly organise times and places to drop off the drugs in white lunch bags along the way.

'When we needed Edgar [Allan Poe, a slang term for EPO], Phillipe would 
zip through the Tour's traffic and make a drop-off,' he claimed.

The following year, Hamilton claims he 
was at Armstrong's villa in Nice when he asked Armstrong if he had any EPO. 
Armstrong pointed to the refrigerator, where Hamilton found the 
drug.

Hamilton also alleges Armstrong and other team members took advantage of
a French law that barred drug testers from taking samples from cyclists between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m so they could sleep.

Explosive book: Hamilton, who wrote The Secret Race with a New York Times journalist, has been banned twice for his own doping offenses

The cyclists would take small amounts of drugs at 10 p.m. so the drugs would be out of 
their systems eight hours later, at the end of the period they called 'glowtime'.

Hamilton cited another example of getting a text from 
his doctor on a prepaid phone which read: 'The restaurant is 167 miles away,' meaning he could get a blood 
transfusion in hotel Room 167.

While Hamilton has twice been banned 
for doping offenses, Armstrong has never failed a test - but Hamilton 
said this is merely because they were 'easy to beat'.

'They 
weren't drug tests,' Hamilton said. 'They were more like discipline tests, IQ tests. If you were careful and paid attention, you could dope and be 99% 
certain that you would not get caught.

'We're way, way ahead of the tests. They've got their doctors and we’ve got ours, and ours are better. Better paid, for sure.'

Hamilton has previously spoken out against Armstrong and the team in interviews with federal criminal investigators.

At the weekend, Armstrong's former personal assistant, Mike Anderson backed up the claims in Outside Magazine. He said Armstrong made little effort to cover up the practice.

'I found a prescription box in the 
medicine cabinet - to the side of the vanity in the bathroom - that sent
everything spiraling,' Anderson wrote.

'I knew what it was. Not exactly at 
first, but I sensed from my rudimentary knowledge of medicine that this 
box shouldn’t be in the bathroom of a professional cyclist. The label 
said Androstenedione.'

But when Anderson confronted Armstrong about it, he shrugged off the severity of the practice.

Disgraced: Armstrong, photographed signing autographs in Montreal last week, was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after he gave up his challenge to the doping accusations

Ousted: Armstrong's former personal trainer Mike Anderson, pictured, claimed he found a banned substance in the cyclist's apartment early last year - and that Armstrong was nonchalant about it

'"Everyone does it," he said 
nonchalantly, looking me straight in the eyes. That floored me. I didn’t
say anything else, but the implication was clear enough,' Anderson wrote.

Anderson's claims have been mocked by a spokesman for Armstrong.

'The alleged substance produces the 
antithesis of an endurance athlete. [It] leads to increased muscle size 
and strength,' Mark Fabiani said, adding 
Anderson was a 'disgruntled former employee'.

Armstrong's reputation as a record-breaking cyclist and inspirational cancer survivor has shattered since he have up his years-long fight to clear himself of doping charges on August 23.

Subsequently, the US Anti-Doping Agency that banned him from competition and stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles.
