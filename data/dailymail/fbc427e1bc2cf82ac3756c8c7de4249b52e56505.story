 A futuristic laser gun that claims to permanently remove hair in 12 weeks and costs a hair-raising £375 is set to become the gadget sensation of the year for British women.

The gizmo, reportedly a favourite with Kim Kardashian, has this week gone on sale at upmarket stores like Harrods and Harvey Nichols.

The Tria Hair Removal Laser claims to be the first DIY machine of its kind and uses light-based laser beams previously only available at salons.

Kim Kardashian is a fan of the £375 Tria laser gun, which comes in fuschia and green

Such treatments are currently the most popular aesthetic beauty treatments among women aged 35 and under.

Tests on the Tria found it zapped away 70 per cent of body hair in just two treatments while use over the course of 12 weeks, once weekly, permanently removed nearly all strands of hair.

And those that escape its rays will come back finer and lighter so they can hardly be seen, said Tria’s CEO Dr Tobin Island.

Already popular in America, the gadget has now arrived in Britain.

Dr Island added: 'The Tria Hair Removal Laser 4X is the latest innovation in professional-quality, at-home solutions for our consumers.

'It has experienced tremendous success and vast consumer acceptance (in the US). We are extremely excited to bring it to UK consumers.'

The handheld, cordless device - which comes in either green or fuchsia - uses a pulse counter and diode laser technology to disable hair follicles.

It only works when applied to the right skin tone. The company recommends it for those with ‘light to medium’ skin tones. Those with very light hair are discouraged from using it as the laser light may not be absorbed efficiently, and those with medium to dark brown or black skin should not use it either, as skin could absorb the laser-light too efficiently and cause burns.
