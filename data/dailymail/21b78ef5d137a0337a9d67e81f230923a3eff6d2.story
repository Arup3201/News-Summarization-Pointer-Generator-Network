England's forgotten man Theo Walcott has stepped up his recovery from the serious knee injury which has kept him out of the World Cup.

Walcott, who has been forced to remain at home as the Three Lions embark on Brazil ahead of this summer's tournament, has been working hard in the gym.

The 25-year-old posted a video of himself lifting weights on Tuesday evening with a friend and said: 'Worked hard at training ground with Jake Thomson. Leg Strength.'

Frontman Walcott was injured during the Gunners' 2-0 victory over north London rivals Tottenham in the third-round of the FA Cup back in January.

Having been taken off on a stretcher, Walcott was ruled out for six months, putting pay to any hopes of making Roy Hodgson's Three Lions squad for this year's showpiece.

The former Southampton youngster was just 17 when he hit the headlines after former England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson selected him as part of his 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup.
