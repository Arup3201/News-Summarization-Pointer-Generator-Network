Artillery exchanges between government forces and Russian-backed separatists were threatening the fragile ceasefire in Ukraine today.

The country's military command yesterday said pro-Russian rebels had attacked 112 times since the ceasefire began on Sunday, mostly in the bitterly contested Debaltseve area.

Spokesman Andriy Lysenko said five Ukrainian troops had been killed and 25 wounded in the past 24 hours. The rebels hit back, accusing Ukrainian forces of shelling Donetsk Airport.

Under the ceasefire agreement negotiated by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, the warring sides are to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line today.

But it now appears unlikely this plan will succeed.

The ceasefire had raised hopes for an end to the conflict, which has so far lasted ten months and claimed more than 5,300 lives.

Meanwhile, the European Union has added 19 people and nine organisations to its list of those facing sanctions.

The additions include two Russian deputy defence ministers, the eastern Ukraine-born Russian singer Iosif Kobzon and several separatist commanders. 

The Russian foreign ministry reacted angrily to the decision, calling it 'clumsy' in the context of last week's ceasefire deal. 

The ministry dismissed the new EU sanctions as 'running against common sense' and harming chances 'to resolve an internal Ukrainian conflict'.

German chancellor Angela Merkel appealed for the ceasefire to be respected.

'The situation is fragile (but) that was certainly to be expected with a view to Debaltseve,' she said.

Rebels said soon after it came into effect that they had no intention of observing the ceasefire at Debaltseve, where they have been advancing since January and now have a Ukrainian unit all but encircled.

Washington says the rebel operation around the town, which sits on a strategic railway hub, is being assisted by the Russian armed forces, which Moscow denies.

Reuters reporters near the front said Debaltseve was being relentlessly bombarded with artillery. 

At least six tanks as well as armoured personnel carriers and artillery could be seen in woods near Vuhlehirsk, 10km (six miles) west of Debaltseve, which the rebels captured a week ago.

Military trucks headed along the main road in the direction of the town to regular bursts of shelling and the firing of Grad rockets and machine guns.

'You can hear there is no ceasefire,' said a rebel fighter with a black ski mask who gave his name as Scorpion, his nom de guerre, and blamed the fighting on Kiev's forces. 'Debaltseve is our land. And we will take Debaltseve.' 

A rebel commander, Eduard Basurin, said Ukrainian troops had violated the ceasefire 27 times in the past 24 hours. 

'The pre-condition for withdrawal of heavy weapons is fulfilling Point One of the Minsk agreements - the ceasefire. One hundred and twelve attacks are not an indicator of a ceasefire,' said a Kiev military spokesman, Andriy Lysenko.

A rebel leader, Denis Pushilin, responded by saying his forces were 'only ready for a mutual withdrawal of equipment'.
