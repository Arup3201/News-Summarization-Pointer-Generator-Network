Prime Minister David Cameron said today the conviction of a Royal Marine for murdering an injured Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan should not 'besmirch' the organisation's 'proud' history.

Speaking on the steps of Downing Street to a group of serving and former Royal Marines raising funds for the Commando 999 charity, he said that yesterday all thoughts were on the 'appalling' court case, during which the marine was found guilty of executing the seriously wounded prisoner in Helmand Province two years ago.

But he told them: 'That in no way represents the spirit and the history of the Royal Marines, an outfit that has one of the proudest histories of any in the world.

Morale boost: David Cameron speaks to a Marine outside Downing Street today in the wake of the conviction for murder of an Afghan prisoner

Defiant: Mr Cameron told the group the conviction 'shouldn't besmirch the spirit and history' of the Marines

Praise: Mr Cameron said the Marines had left Afghanistan in 'a far better state than when we found it'

Proud: The meeting was to mark  Commando 999's attempt to break the Speed March World Record by completing the 26.2 mile London marathon course in less than 4 hours and 19 minutes

'We should not let that single incident besmirch the incredible work the Royal Marines have done, not only over decades but over centuries.'

The Prime Minister said the Royal Marines 'leave the country in a far better state that when we found it', with there being 'no functioning Afghan state' when they arrived in 2001.

He said: 'I wanted to say a big thank you to the Royal Marines for the incredible work you have done in Afghanistan over the last decade.

'I believe we will be able to leave that country with our heads held high.'

The serviceman, a sergeant known as Marine A, was found guilty of murder following a two-week court martial and faces a mandatory life term when he is sentenced next month.

Two others, known only as Marines B and C, were cleared of the same charge.

Meanwhile a distinguished Royal Marines general called for leniency towards Marine A.

Major General Julian Thompson, who led 3 Commando Brigade during the Falklands War, refused to condemn the marine, and told The Times that a five-year prison term would be more suitable than life imprisonment.

'It is like a member of the family who's broken the law': Major General Julian Thompson, who led 3 Commando Brigade in the Falklands War, said he 'would not condemn' the marine who was found guilty of murder

Maj Gen Thompson said the shorter prison term was more appropriate for a crime committed under the unique pressures of war.

He said that 'obviously it was wrong and everyone in the Royal Marines is quite clear about that'.But he added: 'The Royal Marines are a family and it feels as though a member of the family has transgressed.

'I am sad for the man who did it, in that he probably had a moment of stupidity. I feel for him as I would my own son who might do something stupid.'

He said that accepting an enemy's surrender on the battlefield was 'a very, very dangerous time', and told the MailOnline: 'I have no sympathy for the man who was killed but Marine A did the wrong thing by shooting him.

Evidence: Footage captured by a camera mounted 
on the helmet of a Royal Marine and played during the court martial 
proceedings recorded the moment the soldier shot dead the insurgent in 
an Afghan field

A foreign field: After a two-and-a-half week 
trial, a seven-strong military board found Marine A guilty. His comrades -
 named only as Marine B and Marine C - were cleared after nine hours of 
deliberations

Recording: The footage recorded on Marine B's 
helmet camera showed Marine A, a highly respected non-commissioned 
officer, order his men to move the captive out of sight of cameras on a 
surveillance balloon

Scene:
 The prosecution said a single gun shot was fired into the heavily 
injured insurgent's chest at this spot, shown in the video which has 
been blocked from release in case it is used for propaganda by jihadi 
websites

Audio: 'It's nothing you wouldn't do to us,' a soldier is heard saying in the recording after the shot is fired

'But I'm not going to stand around bad-mouthing him. I won't condemn him. It is like a member of the family who has broken the law - you don't reject them, but you support them.'

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said that while the action was 'totally unforgivable', it was important to understand the sort of pressure a battle-hardened soldier could find himself under.

Dismissing the argument that there should be less understanding for an experienced soldier doing such a thing, he said: 'The more times you do tours in that filthy war, the more pressure there is on you.

'We don't know what sort of pressure he was under, however cool he may have sounded on that tape and how pre-meditated it may have sounded.

'He certainly shouldn't serve any less than five years, maybe 10.'

Is this the victim? Inquiries carried out in the
 area of the murder have uncovered evidence that the man shot dead could have 
been Abdullah Jan Agha

He said he expected the Marine to be looked after by the military community.

'He shouldn't be treated as a pariah. He should not be kicked out of the community as it were. I hope and I'm sure the Marines will support him and particularly his family through the years ahead,' he said.'I don't mean that he should be kept in the Royal Marines; what I am saying is that he should not just be rejected and flung to the wolves as it were.

'I do not mean that he's forgiven and allowed back in. What I mean is that he shouldn't just be spat on and rejected.'

Marine A was convicted after footage emerged of him shooting the insurgent at close range in the centre of his chest.

As the man convulsed on the ground, Marine A told him: 'There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It's nothing you wouldn't do to us.'

He then turned to comrades and said: 'Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.'

During the trial, the court heard the marines were on patrol in a 'kinetic' area of Afghanistan on September 15, 2011 when they discovered the insurgent lying seriously injured in a field following an attack by an Apache helicopter.

Superiors were informed the man had died from wounds sustained in the gunship attack, in which 139 30mm anti-tank rounds were fired at him.

But a year later, footage of the murder - taken from a camera mounted on the helmet of Marine B - was discovered on a laptop by military police investigating unrelated matters.

The recording revealed a conversation between the marines before the insurgent was shot.

Marine A was overheard asking 'Anyone want to give first aid to this idiot?' before Marine B replies loudly 'No'.

Marine C, standing over the insurgent pointing a pistol at his head, is heard asking Marine A if he should shoot the man in the head, a request which is refused as 'that would be f****** obvious'.

The marines pretend to give him first aid, he is kicked in the torso by servicemen and soon after shot by Marine A.

During the trial, David Perry QC, prosecuting, told the court martial: 'It was not a killing in the heat and exercise of any armed conflict. The prosecution case is that it amounted to an execution, a field execution.

Marine A told the court martial he thought the insurgent was already dead when he shot him, and said he did so out of anger, calling it a 'stupid, lack of self-control, (a) momentary lapse in my judgment'.

Marine B admitted members of the patrol lied during interviews to protect their comrade.

'We all protected him by telling lies,' Marine B said. 'In my opinion, he had shot an alive, injured insurgent.'

Marine A was remanded in custody to be sentenced on December 6. Marines B and C were freed and returned to normal duties.
