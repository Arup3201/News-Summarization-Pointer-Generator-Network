Gone: Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minneapolis, apartment building last Wednesday after school  

The father of missing Minnesota fourth-grader Barway Collins took out a $30,000 life insurance in his son's name before the boy vanished nearly two weeks ago, it emerged today.  

Barway Collins 10, was last seen after school March 18 near his apartment complex in Crystal. Police said they were working to find the boy and were checking flights to see whether he might have been sent overseas to his mother, believed to be in Liberia.

Last week, Police Chief Stephanie Revering named Barway's father, Pierre Collins, a suspect in the child's disappearance, saying the man who was seen weeping at a vigil has not been entirely honest with investigators. 

Mr Collins has stopped talking to the press about his son's suspected abduction amid mounting suspicions concerning his alleged involvement in the case.

Fox 9 reported Tuesday that according to sources, Mr Collins, 33, took out a life insurance policy in Barway's name totaling $30,000 not long before the child went missing.  

Police said the father failed a lie-detector test  last week, but he has not been arrested or charged with any crime as of Tuesday morning.

Pastor Harding Smith, who has been acting as the family's spokesperson, said Collins has told him he had nothing to do with his son's abduction.

In a recent interview with CNN's Nancy Grace, Collins said he last saw Barway as he was getting ready for school on the morning of March 18.

Grilled: Pierre Collins, accompanied by Pastor Harding Smith, was interviewed by Nancy Grace last week, saying that he failed the polygraph test because he was very emotional  

Police have released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' 

'The father and the party described as an ‘uncle’ are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway’s father has not been completely truthful with us.'

Addressing the footage on the bus, Pierre Collins explained to Nancy Grace that in the Liberian community, children commonly refer to adults as 'uncle' or 'auntie.'

When pressed by Grace about the failed polygraph test, Collins explained that he was 'very emotional' during the test.

'I wasn't...myself when I took the polygraph,' he said.

'There's my dad': The footage in question  (pictured) also has audio and, police say, as the bus pulled up to Barway's building he pointed out his father and an uncle. Previously, police had been searching for anyone who might have seen Barway at that point, the moment of his disappearance

Over the past 13 days, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies have been searching the area for Barway with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses. 

Officials are now focusing their search efforts along the Mississippi River south of Interstate 694, where Pierre Collins was spotted walking in a park after his son went missing.

A $12,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the person responsible for Barway Collins' disappearance.  

According to the Crystal Police Department, a man and woman pictured in a screen shot from a CCTV camera installed at the front entrance of the Cedarwood apartment complex may have witnessed Barway being dropped off from school.

So far, the mystery couple have not been named as suspects or even persons of interest in the case.

While law enforcement officials continued searching for the missing fourth-grader, members of Crystal's Liberian community were busy handing out fliers featuring Barway's picture to help bring him home.

At around 5pm last Monday, more than 100 people gathered outside Cedarwood apartments for an emotional prayer vigil.

'We miss Barway,' his father, Pierre Collins, told the crowd. 'Barway has been gone for a very long time now. We are begging and asking everyone to look out there.'

Chief Revering also attended the gathering, promising Barway's family to continue looking for him until he is found, according to Minneapolis Star Tribune. 

Barway was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm.

Mr Collins and his wife, Yamah, said the entrance surveillance camera caught their son opening the front door to the building, looking inside and then closing it, as if someone called him outside.

'Please just bring him back. We just want Barway back. We don't want anything from them. Just let him go. Just let him come home,' the parents begged, according to KARE11.

Collins is described as 5 feet tall, weighing 80lbs with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, white T-shirt, black pants, red shoes and carrying a red school backpack.

Anyone with information on Barway Collins' whereabouts is being asked to call police.
