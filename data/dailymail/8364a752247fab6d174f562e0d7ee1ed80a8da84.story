A man is believed to have been assassinated after he shot in the head at a flat in Southampton today.

The victim, aged in his 20s, suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and was rushed to hospital but died before doctors could save him.

Detectives went to a house in the city's St Mary's Street shortly after 11am following a stream of 999 calls from worried neighbours, all reporting hearing a single gunshot.

Police said that a Major Crime Team, led by the head of Hampshire CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Cessford, had launched an investigation into the murder under the codenamed Operation Emetic.

Police and paramedics attended the residential street and were helped by members of the South Central Ambulance Services' hazardous area response team as well as three ambulance officers and a rapid response paramedic.
