It may look like an iPhone 4 but this gadget is in fact a stun gun which has landed a 21-year-old man three years in prison.

Marcel Cross was found with the concealed weapon after police were called following reports of a man with a stun gun in Bicester, Oxfordshire.

Officers who attended the scene on January 6 discovered Cross with the gun and despite his claims to have purchased it as a novelty item, he was charged with possession of a firearm.

This is the stun gun belonging to Marcel Cross, pictured beside a real iPhone 4. The only noticeable difference between the two is the buttons are slightly more prominent on the stun gun version

The disguised stun guns are sold cheaply on the internet, often under the pretense of self protection.

PC Joe Stafford, of Banbury CID, said it had been 'cleverly disguised' to look like a mobile phone and said the prison sentence reflected how serious an offence carrying the disguised weapons were.

'The stun gun had been cleverly disguised as an iPhone 4 mobile phone.

Marcel Cross was given a three year prison sentence for possession of the stun gun

There can only be one reason for disguising an item like this and that is to allow a person to carry it without detection.

'The
 seriousness of this was reflected in the sentence passed at court. The 
sentence should act as a deterrent to others who may consider possessing
 a similar item.

'The
 defendant claimed to have purchased the weapon from a local market as a
 novelty item, but the judge stated that the defendant needed to 
recognise the seriousness of the offence.

Cross was jailed at 
Oxford Crown Court on Monday for three years, for possession of a Section
 5 firearm.

Cheap stun guns disguised as the ubiquitous iPhone are becoming steadily more common in the UK.

Earlier this year a 14-year-old boy was found to be carrying one of the concealed stun guns and a confused police officer was zapped by it.

The dangerous device was found when the schoolboy, who was not identified, was arrested alongside three other teenagers after a bus driver complained he was subjected to vile racist taunts.

The guns are mostly manufactured in China and can be bought online for as little as Â£15, but can be deadly - they are capable of discharging blasts of up to 50,000 volts of electricity.

Another variation now on the market includes a stun gun which doubles as an iPhone jacket - meaning it can be used to stun people, or charge your phone.
