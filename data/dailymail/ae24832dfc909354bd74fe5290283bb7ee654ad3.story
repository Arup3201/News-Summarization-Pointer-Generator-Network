Japan's crown prince has warned in a rare public statement that his country must remember World War II 'correctly'.

The unusual intervention comes as politicians fight to downplay the country's historic war crimes, which include sex slavery, torture and mass killings.

Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, believes Japan should tell twentieth-century history more sympathetically.

Historians agree that up to 200,000 women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese during World War II. 

The women are thought to be predominantly from Korea.

In many cases, they were lured with promises of work in factories or restaurants. 

But once they were recruited, the women were forced to stay in 'comfort stations' and work as organised prostitutes. 

Research suggests that 75 per cent of 'comfort women' died and others were left infertile or suffering from sexually transmitted diseases.

Some were beaten and killed by officers.

Prime Minister Abe once said: 'There is no evidence to prove there was coercion, nothing to support it.'

But Naruhito, who released the comments on his 55th birthday, said they must remember the miserable experience.  

He said: 'Today when memories of war are set to fade, I reckon it is important to look back on our past with modesty and pass down correctly the miserable experience and the historic path Japan took from the generation who know the war to the generation who don't.

'It was very painful that many precious lives were lost, many people suffered and felt deep sorrow in the world including in Japan.

'It is important that we never forget people who died in the war... (and we must) deepen our appreciation for our past so as not to repeat the horrors of war and to foster a love of peace.' 

Japan is thought to have killed between three and ten million people during the war, mainly Chinese.

They also conducted the surprise Pearl Harbour attack on a US Navy base in 1941, leading to the US declaring war on them. 

Historians believe Japanese soldiers also tortured prisoners of war and forced them to go through amputations without anesthesia as a form of biological testing. 

Prime Minister Abe's controversial views have already roiled relations with China and South Korea, as well as causing unease in America.

He recently appointed a 16-member panel to advise him on a statement he is set to make later this year to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan's surrender.

Abe has said he will largely stand by Tokyo's previous apologies but speculation is mounting that he will seek to downplay the country's involvement in sexual slavery. 

Known as the 'comfort women' system, mainstream historians agree that up to 200,000 women, predominantly from Korea, were forced into sexual slavery during WWII.

Japanese soldiers point their bayonets at Chinese civilians in Nanjing in 1937. Some Japanese deny that the massacre, in which up to 300,000 Chinese were killed, ever happened

Right-wing Japanese insist there is no documentary proof that the Japanese state or its military were involved in the system and reject official guilt.

That position angers South Korea and China and both countries will be carefully watching any official pronouncement on the war.

While Japan's newspapers remained staid in their coverage of Naruhito's comments, social media users leapt on them.

One user, named @Kirokuro, tweeted: 'This definitely contains a warning against Shinzo Abe, doesn't it?' 

Another, @kazu_w50, wrote: 'It is a regular recognition (of history), but these comments by the crown prince stand out because Prime Minister Abe's views on the constitution and history are outrageous.'

China-Japan relations have been strained since the 1937 Nanking Massacre and what China sees as Japan's refusal to acknowledge the extent of what happened there.

Japanese soldiers murdered tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of Chinese soldiers and civilians during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

They were accused of raping local women and widespread looting.

Estimates of the death-toll range from 40,000 to 300,000, but revisionists in Japan have contended it is much lower and even suggested that the event was entirely fabricated.

China sees the denial to acknowledge the extent of the massacre and Japan's reluctance to apologise as insensitive.
