Harry Martin left his home in Membland, Newton Ferrers, near Plymouth, Devon

A teenager was missing last  night after setting out to take  pictures of the fierce storms  battering the coast.

Harry Martin was seen heading for the shoreline with his camera just as the worst storm for nearly 20 years approached.

Air, sea and land searches were under way along the Devon coast and police say they are ‘extremely concerned’ for the safety of the 18-year-old.

Around the country there were reports of stormwatchers heading to the seaside – prompting emergency workers to beg them to  ‘please, please keep away’.

But sightseers continued to come ‘by the car load’, according to one exhausted official, to gaze at the raw power of the sea battering coastal defences.

Council officers were even forced to call the police to move people away from danger in Burry Port, West Wales.

Ron Cant, of Carmarthenshire council, said: ‘What they cannot know is what is in these waves. The sea takes up a lot of rock, rubble and stones and throws them violently about.

‘Stones weighing up to one hundredweight were being flung into the car park and people were literally putting their lives at risk by being there.’

Similar scenes were seen up and down the coasts of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Cumbria, with stormwatchers braving winds of up to 90mph that were driving 30ft waves in from the Atlantic.

Mark Pilcher, of the Environment Agency, said: ‘I know people like to go out and look at the drama of the waves but please, please do not put yourself at risk.’

Tony Mansell, of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, said: ‘Please, please keep away from this water.’

The latest storm – the fourth to hit the country in a matter of weeks – caused chaos yesterday, battering coastal defences, ripping roads apart and flooding hundreds of homes.

More than 2,200 miles of coastline in the South and West were affected as the tidal surge swept in from the Atlantic.

The Environment Agency, which is facing 550 frontline job cuts this year, is braced for further dramatic weather over the weekend, with relentless rain expected to continue until at least the middle of next week.

The agency last night issued at least nine severe flood alerts for the South West, Midlands, Wales and the North West, again warning residents of ‘danger to life’.

It also issued 330 less severe warnings and alerts across England.

The coastal danger is likely to have 
lessened by this morning, but a second low pressure system is expected 
to arrive from the Atlantic tomorrow, causing another tidal surge that 
will again test sea defences.

Emergency services will have to deal  
with the prospect of inland flooding as rain falls on ground already 
saturated by weeks of wet weather.

Forecasters
 last night warned more flooding was expected in southern England, 
particularly Kent and Gloucestershire, as rivers that burst their banks 
over Christmas again reach dangerous levels.

Pete Fox, head of strategy at the Environment Agency, said: ‘There does not seem to be an end to the unsettled period.’

Mr Martin, who had recently started a degree in film production, left his home in Newton Ferrers, near Plymouth, at 11am on Thursday as the storm began to develop.

Devon and Cornwall Police said he was last seen walking in the direction of the coastal path.

Police, coastguard and lifeboat staff were last night searching areas off the coast and the nearby estuary. The teenager had been at home celebrating Christmas during his holidays from the University of Greenwich in London.

His uncle, Darrell Marshall, said: ‘The police and the coastguard are co-ordinating the search at the moment but we have been searching all day for him.

‘He is very interested in photography, he is doing a course in film production at the University of Greenwich, it is part of his course.’ The teenager, who lives with his father Anthony, 57, mother Georgina, 52, and brother James, 21, is thought to have studied creative media production at Plymouth  College of Art.

On Thursday, rescuers found the body of a 27-year-old man dragged out to sea in Cornwall and on Tuesday a woman died in similar circumstances at Croyde Bay in north Devon. Another man is thought to have fallen into the Stour river near Christchurch, Dorset, on Wednesday night. And the body of clubber Joanna Brown, 36, was yesterday discovered after she was swept off Brighton’s beach shortly before Christmas.

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, 100million Americans were in the grip of a huge and deadly storm of their own. Called Hercules, the storm dumped up to two feet of snow over a third of the country and claimed at least three lives.

Temperatures plunged to a bone-chilling minus 23C. More than 4,000 flights were cancelled and 10,000 were delayed. Courts, government offices and schools were closed with pupils ordered to stay at home.

Britons returning from holidays on the East Coast were stranded when airports, including JFK in New York, were shut down.

Canada was even colder. Winnipeg in Manitoba reported temperatures of minus 37.9C, chillier even than the North Pole.
