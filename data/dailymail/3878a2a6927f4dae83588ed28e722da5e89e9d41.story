Terror: Baghdad Meziane was convicted of funding Al Qaeda but cannot be deported from Britain because of the Human Rights Act 

A convicted terrorist who cannot be deported from the UK once ran off with £40,000 belonging to his British wife, it has been claimed.

Baghdad Meziane, who is linked to the jihadists responsible for the Paris terror attacks, was married to an English woman for 12 years and lived with her in London.

But when the relationship went sour, he transferred thousands of pounds from their joint funds into an Algerian bank account and promptly absconded, according to his former in-laws.

Soon after splitting from his wife Meziane, 50, was convicted of helping to finance Al Qaeda and sentenced to 11 years in prison.

But last week it emerged that the Home Office is unable to send him back to Algeria because he claims he has a right to a family life with his new wife and their two children in Leicester.

Meziane, who holds British as well as Algerian citizenship, is a close associate of Djamel Beghal, mentor to two of the terrorists who attacked Paris earlier this month.

He married his first wife Rachel Whitcombe in 1989 when he needed a British passport, according to The Sun.

The couple - who were childless - owned a home in Leytonstone, east London, but they sold the property when they split up in 2001.

They were planning to share the £40,000 profit - but Meziane took the whole amount and transferred it into a bank account in Algeria.

His former sister-in-law, Anna Whitcombe, said she feared that he might have used the money to fund terrorism.

Fraud: Meziane used this fake French passport as part of a plot to support Al Qaeda's terrorism

'He promised to give her half back and he never did, we obviously assumed that was what it was for,' she told The Sun.

'Looking back she thinks she was a bit blind. He must have been leading a double life.'

She added that Meziane did not seem to be a devout Muslim during his marriage - he never prayed and regularly drank alcohol.

But he was jailed in 2003 after being found guilty of 'entering into a funding arrangement for the purposes of terrorism' - using credit card fraud to raise money which was then passed on to Al Qaeda extremists.

Meziane also collaborated with another jihadist, Brahim Benmerzouga, to secure military equipment and fake travel documents for the use of terrorists.

After leaving prison in 2009, he re-married and had two children, while his first wife has now moved abroad.

A Home Office source claimed last week that efforts to deport Meziane are under way, but he has used the Human Rights Act to stay in the country.

His ally Beghal converted Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four hostages in a kosher supermarket in Paris, to radical Islam when the pair were in prison together.

Beghal is also linked to Cherif Kouachi, one of the two brothers who murdered 11 people in the attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
