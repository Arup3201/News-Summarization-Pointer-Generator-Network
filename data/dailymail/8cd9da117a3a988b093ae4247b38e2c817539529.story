Jane Campion said she wishes she had allowed Holly Hunter's character (pictured with on screen daughter Anna Paquin) to drown

It won three Oscars and made $40million dollars at the box office, but the writer and director of The Piano said she wishes she could change the final, crucial scene.

At the end of the 1993 movie, Holly Hunter's mute character Ada McGrath throws herself into the sea tied to her beloved piano.

But rather than allow herself to drown, she fights back to the surface and goes on to have a settled life with her daughter, Flora, and lover Baines, played by Harvey Keitel.

However, Jane Campion, who won the 
Best Original Screenplay Academy Award, said if she was to film it again
she would allow the character to drown.

She
told the Radio Times: 'I thought some of it was really good. But I 
thought: "For freaking hell's sake, she should have stayed under there."

'It would be more real, wouldn't it? It would be better. I didn't have the nerve at the time.'

The film won the Palme d'Or Best Film Award at Cannes Film Festival and Hunter took the Oscar for Best Actress.

Anna
Paquin, who played her daughter, won the award for Best Supporting 
Actress - the second youngest to do so in the ceremony's history.

Campion and Hunter are being reunited 
in a new six-part BBC2 drama Top Of The Lake, about the disappearance of
a pregnant 12-year-old girl, set in a remote area of New Zealand.

Speaking
about The Piano plot decision, Hunter told the magazine: 'That was 
something Jane toyed with when we shot the movie, to end it there.

The film was a critical and commercial success and both Paquin and Hunter won Oscars for their performances

'And
she's still thinking about it! Me, I love that it's a reverie for Ada, 
not a nightmare or something that haunts her. It soothes her.'

The
BBC series also stars Mad Men star Elisabeth Moss as detective Robin 
Griffin, who is tasked with investigating the girl's disappearance.

Moss said she trained hard for the role.

She told Radio Times: 'I worked out and got some muscle, lowered my voice, learnt an accent and trained with guns.

'Robin is very much an ass-kicker... I run all the time and I don't like to run, I shoot guns, throw darts, chop wood and fish.

'It was shot at Lake Wakatipu, which is freezing, and I went in and I'm scared of the water. I don't go in anything where I can't see the bottom.'

Jane Campion said she did not have the nerve to kill of the main character at the end of the film
