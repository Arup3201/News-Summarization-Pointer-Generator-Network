Wannabe: Aspiring singer Elaine Rennie has had her guitar and amp confiscated after she was found performing in Newcastle at 4am

An aspiring musician and X Factor hopeful has been stripped of her guitar and amp after serenading drinkers leaving Newcastle's bars and clubs at 4am.

Elaine Rennie, a former Stars In Their Eyes finalist, appeared in court after breaching an order banning her from performing late-night shows in the city.

The singer, who entertained the crowds on her electric guitar, has seen her 'bespoke, irreplaceable and unique' amplifier, confiscated at Newcastle Magistrates' Court.

The 42-year-old, from North Tyneside, said the court order will derail her dreams of pursuing a professional musical career, and rule out her chance to perform on X Factor.

She said: 'My equipment was seized four days before I had an X Factor audition in Glasgow.

'I just couldn’t perform, I just broke down in tears. I was just so shocked because I thought I would have had my amp.

'I’ve been singing since I was a child. I’ve got a lot of fans and I’ve never had anything bad written about me.'

Rennie received 175,000 votes when she performed as her heroine Belinda Carlisle on the Stars In Their Eyes in 1999. She won her heat and was watched by 12million viewers in the live final.

In the aftermath of the performance she played across the North East and Europe with her band, The Bumble Bees, and also appeared on Chris Evans’ Breakfast Show.

But she says she now takes part in street performances - including outside St James’ Park - as practise for her fledgling music career and says she donates all her earnings to church and an animal sanctuary.

She said: 'I always give the money away to charities. This year I’m going to try to go on the X Factor and also Britain’s Got Talent.'

Rennie said her re-make of Belinda Carlisle’s Leave a Light On reached the second spot in the dance charts in 2011 and was in the top 40 of the European charts.

Council chiefs - as part of a clampdown on nuisance noise in Newcastle - have drawn up a code of practice for buskers to stop residents being hounded with music.

Rennie has racked-up five offences of operating a loud speaker and creating noise pollution, magistrates were told.

Plea: During a hearing at Newcastle Magistrates¿ Court, Rennie begged chairman of the bench Barry Wagstaff not to take her amplifier, offering to pay a £2,000 fine and pleading: 'I¿d give my life for that amp'

Therapy: Tim Gregory, mitigating for Rennie, said his client will appeal the decision. He told the court she has suffered mental health issues, adding: 'Her music has been her main therapy and it¿s very important to her to keep on playing'

But when a night-time noise team from Newcastle City Council spotted her playing her guitar outside The Gate complex on April 28 last year, they approached her and confiscated her equipment.

During a hearing at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court, Rennie begged chairman of the bench Barry Wagstaff not to take her amplifier, offering to pay a £2,000 fine and pleading: 'I’d give my life for that amp.'

Tim Gregory, mitigating for Rennie, said his client would appeal the decision to confiscate her amp and claimed she had not received the noise abatement notice.

He said the amp was a present from her late aunt and had been specifically tuned for her voice by a specialist who is now retired.

He told the court: 'She’s got a long history of mental health problems including obsessive compulsive disorder and bi-polar condition.

'Her music has been her main therapy and it’s very important to her to keep on playing.'

He added: 'She wants to make a go of it in the music industry. She’s got various options open to her - she wants to go on The X Factor and other music programmes.

'She’s signed on to a music company and she’s got a CD. She works for her local church where she performs.'

Rennie also claimed her public performances acts are 'therapy' for her mental health problems and boosts her self-esteem.

During a hearing at court this week Mr Wagstaff ordered Rennie to pay a £145 fine, £450 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.

Melanie Bulman, prosecuting, told the court a code of conduct introduced for buskers prevented them playing between the hours of 8pm and 10am.

She said: 'Buskers tend to operate in certain areas of the city where people move from one licenced premises to another.

'The problem lies with people walking in the vicinity and crowding around the buskers.'
