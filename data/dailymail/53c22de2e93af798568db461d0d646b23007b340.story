One of Benedict Cumberbatch's former teachers has revealed how the star's Harrow education has hindered his career.

Martin Tyrell, Cumberatch's drama teacher at the public school in north west London, said the actor's expensive education may have limited the range of potential parts he could play.

The Imitation Game actor, 38, has been shortlisted for an Academy Award for his role as mathematician and Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing in the movie.

Talking about the star's time at the £34,590-a-year school, Mr Tyrell told the Radio Times magazine: 'Going to a major independent school is of no importance or value or help at all.

'I don't think anyone ever bought an education at Harrow in order for their son to become an actor.'

He added: 'I feel that they are being limited (from playing certain parts) by critics and audiences as a result of what their parents did for them at the age of 13. And that seems to me very unfair.'

Eddie Redmayne, Dominic West, Damian Lewis and Tom Hiddleston are among the privately educated British actors who are enjoying big success in Hollywood.

Veteran actress Julie Walters, The Walking Dead star David Morrissey and Call The Midwife star Stephen McGann have complained about the dearth of young actors emerging from poorer backgrounds.

Mr Tyrell said he spotted Cumberbatch's talent when he auditioned for the role of 'Saucy French Maid' as a teenager. 

He added: 'Even as a 13-year-old, he was obviously an outstanding actor - a combination of intuition and intellect.

'It's probably once in a lifetime that you find a boy actor as magnificent as this.

'I remember him auditioning very early on for the part of a saucy French maid in a farce. It was a small part, involving a feather duster for about 10 minutes, but even then in rehearsal he was strikingly mature.

'He took direction, immediately understood the comic requirements of the part and was very, very funny. You wonder where on earth the understanding comes from.'
