A Pennsylvania teacher has been charged with having an affair with a male student for almost a year, allegedly exchanging an alleged 509 phone calls with the 16-year-old and 319 text messages.

Sarah O'Neill, 35, a former English teacher at all-boys private boarding school Church Farm School in Exton, was caught by a fellow staff member after leaving a love letter she wrote to the boy on the office printer.

'The thought that I could love so deeply and so wrongly pervaded before you and I even officially began,' O'Neill allegedly wrote the teen, according to NBC Philadelphia. 

'It was quite a long winter break before my lips even attempted yours and I wondered if you were as affected as I.'

Police say the pair had confessed their love to each other and were together 10 months.

The relationship lasted even after O'Neill was asked to resign following the discovery of the letter. 

The teen, who is now 17, told police he began seeing O'Neill in January 2014.

He said they first kissed at Motel 6 in King of Prussia in the February, and then again in March on O'Neill's birthday.

The boy claims the pair also enacted in oral sex on several occasions at the hotel, in O'Neill's car and at a park.

One time her stocking appeared ripped and another O'Neill said she was helping the boy with extra credit, the custodian said.

On top of the hundreds of calls and texts, police say the two talked on the phone for a total of 106 hours and also exchanged emails.

In one the teen asked O'Neill what she was wearing.

She replied: 'I should be wearing sexy clothing for you when you ask that. Like some tight underwear or nothing. But I am too formal for such outlandishness.'

The teen then went missing from campus in November, and it became clear he was O'Neill.
