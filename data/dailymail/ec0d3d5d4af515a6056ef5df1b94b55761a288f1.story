Determined: Home Secretary Theresa May wants to reduce the 'pull factors' blamed for attracting jobless migrants

Migrants from Romania and Bulgaria 
could be barred from using NHS hospitals if they come to Britain without
a job, Theresa May suggested yesterday.

The Home Secretary admitted she would 
not be able to extend travel restrictions on the two countries when 
these expire at the end of next year.

But she said she was determined
to limit the so-called ‘pull factors’ blamed for drawing thousands of 
jobless migrants to the UK.

Home Office sources said officials 
were looking at restricting access to key public services for migrants 
who arrive here without a job.

Areas being looked at include healthcare,
education, housing and benefits.

Detailed proposals will be published 
next year but enforcing any ban will be fraught with difficulties.

The scheme has echoes of California’s 
controversial ‘Proposition 187’ law, which barred undocumented 
immigrants from using public services.

The law was adopted in 1994 but 
abandoned five years later after it was ruled unconstitutional.

Mrs May told the BBC’s Andrew Marr 
Show: ‘I will be looking at the transitional controls on Romania and 
Bulgaria at the end of 2013.

'I will be looking at what we call the pull 
factors, what is it that attracts people sometimes to come over here to 
the United Kingdom, so looking at issues about benefits, and access to 
the Health Service, and things like that.’

Ministers fear that a mass influx of 
immigrants from the two ex-communist regimes could derail the already 
difficult target of reducing net immigration to under 100,000 by 2015.

Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU at 
the start of 2007 and remain its two poorest countries. Transitional 
restrictions were imposed to prevent the kind of influx of migrants seen
when Poland joined the EU.

As a result, migrants from these two 
countries still require a work permit, and there are strict quotas on 
the number who can come to do low-skilled jobs.

Only people who have lived in the UK 
for the past year can get free NHS treatment but a Panorama 
investigation found that a third of 133 hospital trusts that replied to 
Freedom of Information requests made no checks.

Earlier this year an investigation by 
Pulse magazine estimated that over the past three years health tourists 
had been given free hospital treatment worth £40million.

Mrs May also confirmed she was reviewing the wider question of free movement within the EU.

The Home Office is in talks with other
EU countries about stopping illegal immigrants who enter into sham 
marriages with people in other EU countries in order to be able to work 
and travel freely across the continent.

Mrs May insisted the Government was 
still committed to its target of cutting net immigration from well over 
200,000 a year to under 100,000.

‘That is still our aim, that we will 
get net migration down to the tens of thousands,’ she said. ‘In the last
figures, which were to the end of last December, we saw 30,000 fewer 
net migrants – the first significant fall for many years.’

Tory critics believe the target is 
unachievable without restrictions on migration from the EU. But senior 
Lib Dems, including Business Secretary Vince Cable, argue tight 
restrictions could damage the economy.
