Jacksonville International Airport in Florida reopened late on Tuesday night after being evacuated during the evening when authorities found two suspicious packages.

Jacksonville Sheriff's Office spokesman Shannon Hartley told a news conference on Tuesday night that one of two suspicious packages found at the airport had a 'destructive' component that required it to be taken offsite. He said the device was later 'rendered safe.'

One package was found in a garage, another in a terminal, although Hartley wouldn't say which of the packages was destructive.

At least two people were arrested on Tuesday evening at Jacksonville International Airport after authorities found two suspicious packages

A witness had reported seeing at least 
two men handcuffed in separate spots - one in the airport and one 
outside - shortly before 6 p.m.

A second witness told the Florida Times-Union that he saw police throw a man to the ground outside the airport and then put him in handcuffs. No details have been released about the men witnesses said were arrested.

A Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office bomb squad team had been called to the scene and the evacuation left planeloads of passengers stuck on the tarmac.

Authorities tweeted news of the evacuation on the airport's official Twitter site, but only said that the airport had been evacuated ‘due to police activity regarding suspicious’ packages.

There were no reports of injuries or damage. Jacksonville police had blocked off the entrance to the airport.

Airport officials also tweeted that passengers on inbound flights currently on the ground would be bused to offsite hotels as transportation became available.

Stewart advised people intending to fly from the airport or pick up travelers to check with their individual airlines on the status of the flights.

The incident began when authorities confronted a suspicious man who claimed he had a bomb, while a second man was seen running from the area.

One witness, Paul Harral, told the Florida Times-Union, that he and his wife were in a security line when he saw a man talking to a Transportation Security Administration Officer nearby.

He said the officer called for an airport police officer and they took the man into the security area beyond the x-ray machine.

Harral said he next saw the man he was in handcuffs and TSA officers started to tell those in line to leave the airport.

Then when he was leaving the airport he saw two police officers with a man lying on the ground in handcuffs. He said the man appeared to carrying a duffel bag.

It is unclear how many planes are on the ground were delayed or the number of travelers impacted.
