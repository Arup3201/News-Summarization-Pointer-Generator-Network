By day, well-spoken Katy Lees is a serious businesswoman running her own cleaning firm. But by night, she transforms herself into a sexy, self-styled 'queen of the chavs' female wrestler.

The 24-year-old from Worcester has been impressing fans with her loudmouth alter-ego 'Chardonnay'. When in character, she wears pink Burberry hot-pants, a diamante encrusted cap and gold chain.

She was first introduced to the sport as a child when her older brother and his friends used to try out their combat moves on her after watching wrestling shows.

And since taking up wrestling in her spare time, Katy now travels the UK performing in bouts and is now poised to enter the lucrative American wrestling scene.

Since taking up the sport, super-fit Katy has had two teeth knocked out and once had to go to A&E after her head was slammed on the floor of the ring.

This week she is preparing for a title fight in her home town of Worcester.

The unusual hobby has taken a toll on Katy, who has even had teeth knocked out in the ring 

If successful, she hopes to give up her cleaning career and become a full-time competitor on the wrestling circuit in America.

She said: 'I decided on my alter ego of Chardonnay because it is the furthest thing from me. I hate chavs and it gave me the opportunity to really play at being someone else.

'It gives me a chance to rebel which is really fun because I'm still living at home with my mum and do cleaning during the day, so it's a complete change of scene.

'It's hilarious, I get in the ring and start behaving like a juvenile delinquent. I'm usually the villain so the more people that boo, the better.

'I got into it as a kid when my brother used to watch it. His friends would come round and try all their wrestling moves on me.'

Katy says wrestling is her way of rebelling and hopes to soon be able to quit her cleaning job to compete in the sport full time 

She added: 'Mum had to take me to A&E once because they did a 'Power Bomb' on me and I banged my head really badly.

'But I still loved it, and when I got the chance to go and try it about five years ago it was amazing.

'So as soon as I got a car I started going to training in Gloucester every week, and started thinking about an alter-ego.

'When I began entering actual shows at the beginning of this year I had to have a definite character, and since chavs aren't particularly popular anyway I thought that would be funny.

'People shout stuff at me all the time when I'm in the ring but I play up to it, I just like to pretend I'm Vicky Pollard or that Catherine Tait character, Lauren Cooper.

'My dream is to get picked up by NXT, which is the development branch for WWE in Florida.

'That would be absolutely amazing, but I know I will have to work really hard to achieve that.

Katy says she picked her 'chav' character when she began competing in shows as she thought it would be funny and it allows her to play the villain in the ring 

'At the moment we usually get about two hundred people coming to shows, and there is always one female fight on the ticket.

'My mum comes to watch sometimes, and my friends have been along too and they just think it's hilarious.

'I set up my own company cleaning people's homes just before I got into wrestling three years ago, because I knew I was going to need a flexible job if I'm going to pursue this long term.'

Katy's mother, Jackie, 57, who works as a carer, fully supports her daughter's unusual sport.

She said: 'I really like the wrestling too.

'My dad used to make us watch it, and I wasn't sure about Katy getting into it because I thought there were no other girls interested, but there are.

'I've been to see her a few times now and enjoyed it a lot.

'People have only heard of the American wrestling usually but the standard of British wrestling is really good too.'

Promoter Lee Hall said he believed she has what it takes to make it in WWE, the world's biggest wrestling corporation.

He said: 'I really think she's got what it takes to make it. She's very determined, she's physical and she's very attractive as well.

'I truly believe she's got the quality they look for in the WWE.

'I had one young lady who went to America to work for WWE but it wasn't really her cup of tea and she came back after a few months.'
