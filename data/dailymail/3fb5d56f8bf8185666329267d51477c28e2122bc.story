These are the Second World War bunkers that still crouch on the landscape as echoes of the biggest conflict in history.

Photographer Jonathan Andrew scoured the wartime territory of The Netherlands, France, Belgium and even Scotland to take these eerie images.

He has captured the stern beauty of structures once meant to withstand the fury of war.

The Type 583a / M 178 Fire Control Post at 
Heerenduin, Ijmuiden, Netherlands: Photographer Jonathan Andrew scoured 
the Netherlands, France, Belgium and even 
Scotland to take these eerie images

Type 669 Heenschemolen Bunker, Heensche Molen, Netherlands: The 
photographer said he started his collection over bunker photos because 
he 'found the geometry and shape of the structures fascinating'

The Type 703 Emminkhuizen, south of Renswoude, 
Netherlands: Most of the structures photographed in the set are part of 
the Atlantic Wall fortifications, but this is part of the De Westwall, 
aka the Siegfried Line, which sat between Germany and France

The R636 Fire Control Post, Zuydcoote, near 
Dunkirk, France: The Atlantic Wall fortifications were built in 
anticipation of an Allied invasion. Mr Andrew says it 'is as if they 
were still on guard but nobody had told them the war is over'

The SK Observation Tower, Fliegerhorst, 
Hemiksem, Belgium: This lookout post formed part of a decoy airfield, 
intended to draw away Allied attacks. It was not a success, the Allies 
did bomb it - but with wooden bombs...

The Type L483 transmitter bunker, Spaarndam, 
Netherlands: Graffiti artists have given this inland fortification, just
 east of Haarlem, a second, less destructive chance at life as a canvas 
for their typographical artworks

The 42-year-old, originally from 
Stockport, Cheshire, but now living in Amsterdam, Holland, started his 
bunker odyssey in 2009 and has now visited them all over Europe.

'I
 originally found the  geometry and shape of the structures fascinating 
and the fact that they were just left standing alone in a farmer's field
 or on a beach,' he said.

'It
 was as if they were still on guard but nobody had told them the war is 
over. Once I started photographing them it was impossible not to be 
moved by what the buildings symbolised and what they have witnessed.'

Vital defences: Field Marshal Erwin Rommel inspects the Atlantic Wall fortifications in France in March 1944, three months before the D-Day landings that spelled the beginning of the end of the Nazi empire in Europe

Built by thousands of forced labourers, the Atlantic Wall fortifications stretch from the Spanish border to the northernmost tip of Norway.

Begun in 1942, following the devastating raid by British commandos which destroyed the dry dock at St Nazaire, they were strengthened in 1944 on the orders of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who believed Germany could not resist an invasion of Europe were it not stopped at the beach.

He ordered strings of concrete pillboxes built along the coast, as well as the planting of anti-tank obstacles and millions of mines, in the hope his forces could destroy an Allied invasion force before it could gain a toe-hold.

The defences were never completed and, as history shows, they were insufficient to hold back British and U.S. troops as they flooded into Europe on D-Day.

However, in subsequent years, their existence was used to answer Soviet charges that Western leaders had delayed the opening of a second front in Europe. 

Most of the structures photographed 
for Mr Andrew's set are part of the Atlantic Wall fortifications, put up
 by the Nazis between 1942 and 1945 in anticipation of an Allied 
invasion of the continent from Britain.

The
 first were chosen simply because the Netherlands-based photographer had
 noticed them while driving between assignments, and been taken by their
 surreal, decaying aesthetic.

But
 subsequently he began to hunt down more and more unusual bunkers dotted
 around the coast and countryside of north-west Europe.

He
 researched online, used Google maps and scoured history books in the 
search for more of these ghosts of Europe's brutal wartime history.

'Obviously a lot of them are the 
same, so I avoid repeating myself,' Mr Andrew said. 'I choose them by 
design, concentrating on those which are unusual.'

He added: 'It's almost absurd that these things are still there.

'The
 shape of them is purely functional, it's just this weird shape and if 
you didn't know anything about it you would think "what's this?"'

Mr Andrew uses a special technique to
 photograph his bunkers that gives them their eerie glow, making them 
seem almost like the apparitions of fallen soldiers.

He
 explained that each photograph is taking just on the cusp of 
night-time, in a 15-minute time window just as the last light of the day
 fades.

Each is the product
 of a long, 10-minute exposure, with Mr Andrew walking around the 
structures with a strobe flash to shine light on them from every angle.

He
 must dress all in black, with his face covered by a black balaclava, as
 he carries out the lengthy process to ensure that he does not appear in
 the final image.

'The technique I use when I photograph the bunkers means that I have a 10 to 15 minute window of opportunity to photograph them,' he said.

He explained that he must capture them in perfect light conditions just as day turns to night.

'I walk around the structures with a strobe and flash them,' he added. 'They are very long exposures of about 10 minutes each.'

D-Day landings: A U.S. Coast Guard landing barge, tightly packed with helmeted soldiers, approaches the shore at Normandy, France, during initial Allied landing operations, on June 6, 1944

The first wave: American soldiers swarm from their landing craft towards the beaches of Normandy, where they faced fierce resistance from Wehrmacht soldiers holed up in the bunkers lining the shore

Only the brave: After landing at the shore at Normandy, these British troops wait for the signal to move forward into the French countryside

Mr Andrew says his favourite image is
 the anti-submarine defences at Cramond Island, near Edinburgh, one of 
the few in his set to show British fortifications.

'I
 think that these structures almost look like the Easter Island 
statues,' he said. 'There's something very strange about them. The 
pattern they make coming out of the water I find very haunting and I 
didn't expect there would be any bunker kind of stuff in Edinburgh.'

Another curious bunker photographed by Mr Andrew is the observation tower for a dummy airfield in Fliegerhorst, Belgium.

Alexandre
 Moretus, current owner of the land in which the bunker sits, told him: 
'Did you know this observation tower was a part of a decoy (fake) 
airfield intended to distract allied air attacks.

'This was not a success in this case... The allied bombed it but... with wooden bombs.'

The Military Casemate Type 623, West of Koudekerke, Netherlands: the Atlantic Wall was begun in 1942, following the devastating raid by British commandos which destroyed the dry dock at St Nazaire, and strengthened in 1944

Type V143 Mammut Radar Antenne, Waringzelle, Nord Pas de Calais: Field Marshal Erwin Rommel ordered the  second phase of building because he believed Germany could not resist an invasion of Europe were it not stopped at the beach

The Dragon Teeth, Riegelstellung Dune, BPT: Used
 to slow down tanks and mechanised infantry, landmines were often placed
 between the teeth

We had some defences too: The Cramond Island submarine defence boom, near Edinburgh, Scotland, which are Mr Andrew's favourite in the entire collection

'I'm not trying to make an anti-war statement': Nevertheless, Mr Andrew, pictured, who photographs the bunkers between paid assignments, says it is 'impossible not to be moved by what the buildings symbolised and what they have witnessed'

The photos were not 
taken to make an anti-war statement, Mr Andrew said, but to offer an insight into a 
fascinating chapter in history.

'As
 a photographer you try and point things out to people which you find 
beautiful or fascinating and ask them to take a longer, closer look,' he
 said.

'I'm not trying to 
make an anti-war statement but just bring them to peoples attention, 
show people these amazing buildings, steeped in such incredible history 
are still scattered throughout Europe's fields and dunes.

'I work on the bunker photographs only in the winter, it's taken about three winters to photograph the collection so far. It's a personal project, so I have to find time between my regular paid assignments.

'It's surprising to see some bunkers being used by farmers for other purposes, such as storing animal feed, farm equipment etc. I'm also amazed at the shear number of them still around, some in very good condition.'
