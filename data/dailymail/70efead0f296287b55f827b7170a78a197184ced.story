Low-cost American airline JetBlue is the latest in a string of budget carriers to add fees to checked baggage and squeeze seats even closer together in order to boost profit.

The airline said it will create three ticket classes beginning in the first half of 2015, and only the top two include at least one free checked bag.

Checked bag fees emerged in 2008, when airlines needed money to cover rising fuel costs. In the first six months of this year, U.S. airlines raised $1.7bn (£1bn) from bag fees.

Extra costs: Budget airline JetBlue is the latest major US airline to charge passengers to check in bags

JetBlue's decision will leave Southwest as the only major US airline to let all passengers check a bag free. And needless to say, passengers are not happy.

Some complained that JetBlue was sacrificing perks that helped the airline win customer-satisfaction awards year after year.

'Airline tickets are already expensive,' said longtime JetBlue flier Maxwell Haddad, from New York.

He added that not charging for the first bag 'was an extra level of kindness or service that JetBlue offered. They seemed to value customer service above and beyond other airlines.'

JetBlue declined to give prices but said adding fewer than half of their passengers check in a bag.

Complaints: Unsurprisingly, customers are not happy with the prospect of paying to check in bags 

The airline also will add 15 seats to its Airbus A320 planes, increasing capacity to 165 from 150, which will reduce the  average legroom to from 34.7 to 33.1 inches. 

The changes will begin in late 2016 and take two years to implement, say JetBlue representatives, adding that there will still be more legroom in the main cabins of bigger airlines. 

It's thought that the new fare classes and bag fees will generate more than $200m (around £130m) a year in operating income.

Incoming CEO Robin Hayes, a former British Airways executive, said that other features such as  free wifi, snacks and no overbooking mean that the airline can add bag fees and seats without driving away customers.

He said: 'I'm confident when customers get on and see the cabin and experience the product, they're going to say, "Wow, this is actually better than what JetBlue was flying before".' 

JetBlue announced the changes as it met in New York with investors, who have been pressing the company to boost revenue and profit margins.
