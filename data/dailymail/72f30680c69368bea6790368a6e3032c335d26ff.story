Migrants in the French port of Calais have gone on hunger strike demanding to be let into Britain.

Around 35 refugees from Afghanistan and Egypt have vowed to refuse food until a list of demands issued to Calais officials is met.

The hunger strikers are being backed by around 260 more migrants all calling for the French and British authorities to resume talks aimed at allowing them to move legally to Britain.

Their other demands include houses with toilets and showers to live in while they are stranded in Calais, three meals a day and freedom from police controls and evictions.

One aid worker said some migrants had threatened to sew their lips together until their demands are met.

He added: 'We urged them not to do that, but to eat instead.'

The same demands were made in an open letter to Calais prefect Denis Robin last week, after French riot police bulldozed a squalid refugee campsite in the town this month claiming it was infested with scabies.

Since then around 300 of them have been sleeping in the meal distribution centre in Calais

Their letter to Mr Robin said: 'We no longer want to live like animals, but as normal human beings in dignified conditions, whether or not we have identity papers.

'We want roofs over our heads, decent hygiene conditions, three meals a day and an end to police controls, while talks resume between the UK and France regarding our final destination.'

Calais migrant aid worker Cecile Bossy said: 'Everyone wants to find a solution to this extremely complex problem.

'Right now, the main issue is finding them somewhere they can be sheltered.'

Calais police said they would meet with local aid organisations this week to monitor the ongoing hunger strike situation.

Large numbers of migrants have been living rough in Calais since the Sangatte hostel was bulldozed in 2002.

There are believed to be around 1,000 refugees currently along the northern French coast, with around 650 near the port where they hope to sneak aboard ferries and lorries bound for Dover.

Migrants are frequently killed in desperate attempts to smuggle themselves across the English Channel on lorries or buses. Last week a Sudanese teenager died after being crushed under a British tour bus that he’d clung to in an effort to reach England.

Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart recently blamed the UK’s ‘generous’ state benefits for refugees for the camps in her town.

She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. That’s enough. It’s no longer tenable. It’s necessary to renegotiate these accords. We’re not here to do their job.'
