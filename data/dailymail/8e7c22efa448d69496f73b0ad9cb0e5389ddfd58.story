New signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas looked at home straight away as they took part in a Chelsea training session led by manager Jose Mourinho in Austria.

The duo, signed from Atletico Madrid and Barcelona this summer respectively, looked refreshed and in high spirits - despite their involvement in Spain's disastrous World Cup.

Costa flew in overnight from Lisbon and joined up with the Chelsea squad early on Monday morning before boarding a plane with the rest of the squad.

Mourinho looked to be in a serious mood as he led training, ensuring his players are fired up and ready to make a big impression during pre-season.

Chelsea finished last season trophyless - the second year in a row Mourinho has won nothing after a fruitless 12 months with Real Madrid - and he is determined to change that in the coming campaign. 

A host of talented loanees have also made their return to Chelsea and are on the tour, including Thibaut Courtois, Kurt Zouma and Oriol Romeu.

Chelsea's first game of their pre-season tour is versus  Wolfsberger AC on Wednesday, followed matches against Olimpija, Vitesse and Werder Bremen.

Their final match will be against Ferecavros in Budapest on the 10th August.
