The Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, pictured has defended the 2.5 per cent rise in interest rates

The cost of a typical mortgage could jump by nearly £175 a month over the next three years, homeowners were warned yesterday.

The Bank of England suggested interest rates are likely to rise to 2.5 per cent by early 2017 – five times the current level of 0.5 per cent.

Such an increase would add £174 a month – or £2,088 a year – to a typical £150,000 standard variable rate mortgage.

Although the move would benefit the millions of savers who have been hit by record rock-bottom rates since March 2009, many cash-strapped households are ‘vulnerable’ to higher borrowing costs.

The central bank’s Governor Mark Carney said a rise of 2.5 per cent would cushion the blow because it is still half the average rate of 5 per cent seen before the financial crisis.

There would be no fast return to pre-downturn levels, said the Canadian, adding: ‘The old normal is not the new normal.

‘The new normal is materially lower than the old normal.’

His comments came as a series of reports suggested the economic recovery is broadening.

The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product, the total size of the economy, rose 0.8 per cent between January and March. Business investment – which is seen as crucial to a balanced and sustainable recovery – jumped 5 per cent in just three months and was 10.6 per cent higher than a year earlier.

A separate report by polling group GfK showed consumer confidence in May was at its highest level for more than nine years. Martin Beck, of economic forecasters the EY Item Club, said: ‘It looks like the UK growth engine is now firing on all cylinders.’

Households have frequently been warned that interest rate rises are imminent as the economy strengthens.

Mr Carney, who was this week criticised for behaving like ‘an unreliable boyfriend’ for sending out mixed messages about when rates will go up, said the exact timing is not important. ‘The big picture is where interest rates go in the medium term, because if I am taking out a mortgage, that is what I care about,’ he said.

Mr Carney said 2.5 per cent rates are ‘not inconsistent’ with a full recovery. However, he said any increases will be ‘gradual’ and ‘limited’ – fearing that families struggling with mortgage repayments will harm the economy by reducing their spending.

Figures from the Land Registry yesterday also showed the emergence of a ‘two-speed’ housing market between London and elsewhere in the UK.

Average prices in the capital grew 18.5 per cent to £439,719, compared with a rise of just 0.9 per cent in the North East to £99,319.
