As the new Pope’s refreshing informality continues to make waves — yesterday, he agreed to be part of a 'selfie' photograph taken by a teenager inside St Peter’s in Rome — there has been an equally seismic change within Britain’s leading Catholic public school, Ampleforth College.

The £30,264-a-year school — past pupils include Lord (Julian) Fellowes, Rupert Everett, the Duke of Norfolk and ex-rugby star Lawrence Dallaglio — has just announced that its headmaster, Father Gabriel Everitt, will be retiring next year after ten years in the post.

But in a huge break from tradition, the next head will not be a monk, as was automatic in the past.

Prestigious: The UK's premier Catholic school is to get a new head - but he won't be a monk

Alumnus: Rupert Everett is among the famous names to have attended  Ampleforth school

Indeed, ever since the school, in North Yorkshire, was founded in 1802, there has always been a monk at the helm, drawn from the school’s founding Benedictine Monastery, Ampleforth Abbey.

At one stage, all the school masters were monks, having been specially trained at Ampleforth’s private Oxford College, St Benet’s Hall. And there were no women teachers either.

But over the past 20 or so years, and particularly since it became co-educational three years ago, there are many more women on the staff and now, of the school’s 84 full-time staff, just five are monks.

Yesterday, a letter was sent out to the parents of the 600 pupils at the school informing them that Father Gabriel, 57, would be retiring, and announcing the 'significant' change. The new lay headmaster will be appointed after September next year.

'At this present time, the imperative to appoint the best possible head for the college compels us to seek a professional lay head,' says the Abbot, Cuthbert Madden.

'This conclusion has not been arrived at lightly, but, given both the nature and commitments of the monastic community and the needs of the school for the best possible leadership, we have decided upon this as the appropriate course of action.'

A spokesman for the school tells me: 'It’s a co-educational establishment, so the future head could just as easily be  a headmistress.

‘We will simply be looking for the best Catholic candidate we can find.’

As world leaders agonised over sending warships to Syria, David Cameron faced his own battle on the high seas.

Holidaymakers described seeing the portly Prime Minister attempting to haul himself onto a speedboat in Daymer Bay in Cornwall. It happened on the last day of his family break before rushing back to take charge of the Syrian crisis.

One onlooker says: 'He was with his family and friends and security on the beach, when this speedboat roared up. He waded out to it and tried to clamber aboard. But despite a lot of huffing and puffing, he couldn’t get in. It took him about five minutes before he finally managed it.'

Nerve-wracking: Model Katya Elisarova will appear on stage in London for the first time this week

She dreams of being a Hollywood star, but when model Katia Elizarova treads the boards in London for the first time this week, she admits it will be the most nerve-racking gig of her life.

Fortunately, she tells me, her younger sister, Alisa, 22, is on hand to keep her calm.

'Thank goodness for Alisa,’ says Katia, 26. 'She’s flown over from Moscow not only to see me perform — but also to help out backstage.'

In Sunstroke, Katia plays a 19th-century Russian woman who has an affair with a dashing Army officer. It opens at the Platform Theatre at King’s Cross.

'There’s no full-time stage crew, so Alisa and I have been painting the stage and helping with the scenery,' says Katia, muse of Russian multi-millionaire Leon Max for whom she has modelled at his stately home, Easton Neston.

'What with endless rehearsals, some days I’ve been in the theatre until midnight.

'Alisa is good at dances such as waltzes, which feature in the play, and she has taught me how to do them, too, while staying with me in Chelsea.

'She loves England so much I think she might even join me here eventually, but she doesn’t want to be an actress, she wants to do something sensible — like being on a  news channel.'

Nose job: Naomi Watts had to wear a prosthetic nose to play Princess Diana in an upcoming film

Hollywood actress Naomi Watts has admitted to painstakingly researching Princess Diana’s accent and mannerisms for her forthcoming biopic — but what of her decision to wear a fake nose?

While some fans of the Princess may not approve, petite Naomi, 44, says she had to remove the middle of her eyebrows so the proboscis would fit.

'We had a prosthetic nose made because mine is very different to Di’s. She had a strong nose that was pointy.

'If you put a point on the end of my nose, it looks like I’m wearing a nose that’s too big for me,' Oscar-nominated Naomi says.

'So we just went for the bridge of the nose and shaved my eyebrows in the centre to make room for it.'

Perhaps she sought Di’s permission from beyond the grave . . .

Prince William has already revealed that his son, George, is 'a bit of a rascal', and now he has a playmate.

William’s Ludgrove prep school chum, commodity broker Andrew Charlton, is celebrating the birth of Luke Edward Charlton with his wife, Edwina, daughter of Lord Palmer, a scion of the Huntley & Palmers biscuit family.

Says a friend: 'Luke was born in Singapore, where Andrew and Eddy live now. Both mother and baby are doing really well.' The couple wed two years ago at Edwina’s father’s grand country pile, Manderston, in Berwickshire.

These are heady days for Dan Skelton, son of London Olympic gold medallist and showjumping star Nick. Yesterday, Dan made his debut as a trainer when his horse Gavroche Gaugain ran at Stratford.

And, I can reveal, Dan, 28, and his wife Grace, 24, a solicitor who runs her husband’s new office, are expecting their first baby.

'I can’t wait. The baby is due on October 21 and we don’t know if it’s a boy or a girl,' Dan tells me.

'Grace is getting to the stage where it’s a concerted effort for her to do anything. But we’re very lucky to have such wonderful support.'

Indeed, his new venture is a family affair: Nick helped set up the stables and Dan’s younger brother, Harry, 24, who won the Irish Grand National in 2009, is stable jockey.

P.S. He was responsible for one of the most enduring royal scoops of modern times — Prince Philip’s 'slitty eyes' remark to a group of students during the Queen’s 1986 visit to China.

Nonetheless,  the residents of Buckingham Palace  will be saddened to learn of the death of veteran royal writer Alan Hamilton at the age of 70.

For the distinguished Times journalist and author covered the highs as well as the lows of royal history with equal flair.

Yet throughout it all, he eschewed sensation. When the Queen’s Press secretary was first informed of the 'slitty eyes' gaffe, he implored Hamilton not to write about it.  'Surely The Times, of all people, are not going to use this?' he begged. 'Most certainly,' Hamilton replied, 'but not until paragraph 14.'
