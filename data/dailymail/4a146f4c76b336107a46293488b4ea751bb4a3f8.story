West Brom head coach Alan Irvine has confirmed Chris Brunt will continue to wear the captain's armband ahead of the new Barclays Premier League season.

It means Brunt will have skippered the side under four different managers as he took up the role during the 2010-11 season, working with Roy Hodgson, Steve Clarke, Pepe Mel, and now Irvine.

'Chris will absolutely be our captain,' Irvine told the club's official website.

'There's absolutely no reason to change it. He has the respect of the changing room, he's done a great job as captain for many years, so I have no intention to make any changes.'
