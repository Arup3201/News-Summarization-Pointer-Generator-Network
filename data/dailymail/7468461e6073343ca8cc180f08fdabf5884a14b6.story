A proposed airport in the Thames estuary would be in the 'very worst spot' for the south-east's crowded airspace, according to the boss of Britain's air traffic control service.

Richard Deakin, chief executive of the National Air Traffic Services (Nats), said there were 'serious challenges' in working more planes into an already busy flight path.

He added that the architects who unveiled
plans for the £50bn project last November had not even asked air 
traffic control about the feasibility of the airport.

'The very worst spot': An artist's impression of how the 'Boris Island' airport in the Thames estuary could look

The stinging attack on plans for the 'floating' airport from Britain's most senior air traffic chief will add to growing calls it to be scrapped.

Deakin said that the Thames estuary airport - dubbed the 'Boris Island' after London Mayor Boris Johnson - would be built under flight paths for four of London's five airports. These include Heathrow, Gatwick, Stanstead, Luton and London City.

'We're a little surprised that none of the architects thought it worthwhile to have a little chat,' Mr Deakin told the Guardian.

The plans by architects Foster and Partners were revealed in January and would make the airport the biggest in Britain.

Busy: The four-runway airport in the Thames would be capable of handling 150 million passengers a year, but there are concerns about airspace congestion

Mr Deakin said that the majority of flight paths criss-crossed the direct spot where the Estuary airport is planned. This would lead to more traffic jams in the air.

Planes arriving and departing airports
must follow strict flight paths. If the skies are congested the planes 
must circle before there is a slot in the sky.

He added that in addition to the risk of planes being hit by birds in the wetands, there would also be competition for air space from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. More flights would then be forced to circle overhead for longer.

Mr Deakin said that even though the Estuary airport was possible it would go against plans in the aviation industry to conserve fuel by shortening flight times.

He called for a third runway to be built at Heathrow. 'The single biggest thing we could do to reduce CO2 in the UK is to build a third runway at Heathrow,' he said.

'Heathrow holding is not about airspace - it's about lack of tarmac. I'm very confident that (a third runway) would eliminate all the holding patterns in one go.'

Controversial: The plans for a third runway have been met with constant strong opposition from local residents near the proposed site

The Coalition agreement signed between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in 2010 banned any extra airports. However, there is growing pressure from BAA, the flight industry and from Tory ministers for Britain to increase its air capacity.

David Cameron has even signalled his intention to increase the number of flights coming in and out of the UK either by expanding Heathrow or building anew airport.

One of the most likely options is the 'Boris Island'. The Government aviation review is currently looking at the project after George Osborne announced in the Budget that Britain needed to  ‘confront the lack of airport capacity’ in the South East of England.

The £50billion airport would be built on an artificial island made of landfill and would be capable of handling 150 million passengers annually -  or 300,000 passengers a day - making it Britain’s main international hub.

Having initalliy ruled out a third runway at Heathrow after opposition from locals and environmental groups, the Government is ‘increasingly interested’ in the idea.

The scheme is expected to cost between £40billion and £70billion. The airport would have four runways, with space to build two more.

Mr Johnson has also praised separate designs by architect Lord Foster for a £50billion airport on a sparse strip of land on the Isle of Grain in Kent, which juts out into the estuary.

London Mayoral candidate Siobhan Benita today slammed Mr Johnson's 'fantasy island' and called for a third runway at Heathrow.

She said: 'By blocking the runway, Boris Johnson is preventing the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in London and depriving our economy of billions of pounds.

Surely this government’s U-turn on Heathrow has left Boris Johnson stranded on his fantasy island.'

'By the time a new airport is built, London will have lost out to another European city, like Madrid, Frankfurt or Paris and that would sound the death knell to Heathrow. That would be a devastating blow to jobs and the economy.'

Environmental campaigners have criticised the plans for the damage they could do to rare wildlife in the estuary, as well as adding to Britain's CO2 emissions.

The Government has meanwhile signalled that plans for a controversial third runway at Heathrow are 'back on the table'.

The Chancellor has refused to rule out expanding Britain's biggest airport because he believes it is key to our 'hub status' and essential to Britain's economic future.

Earlier this month a report suggested that the UK economy will suffer by up to £8.5billion per year over the next decade if Heathrow does not undergo significant expansion.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: 'In the summer we will consult on an overarching sustainable framework for UK aviation and alongside this we will publish a call for evidence on maintaining effective UK hub airport connectivity. The coalition's position regarding Heathrow has not changed.'
