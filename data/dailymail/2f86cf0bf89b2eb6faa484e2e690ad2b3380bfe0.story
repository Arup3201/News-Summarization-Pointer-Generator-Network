The man suspected of killing the 2-year-old biological son of NFL star Adrian Peterson apparently feels indignant enough to see himself as a secondary victim.

Joey Patterson was the only other person in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota apartment when he called police to report that his girlfriend's son Tyrese was choking.

Patterson has since been arrested and charged with aggravated battery and assault but the charges may be increased to murder since the toddler was taken off life support following the injuries sustained to his head.

Accused: Joey Patterson, 27, was the only other person in his girlfriend's apartment at the time that he called police to report that her son Tyrese was 'choking'. The boy died from head injuries two days later

History of violence: Patterson has been charged with domestic violence issues in the past and faced restraining orders and his current charges of assault and battery could be increased to murder since the boy died

Tragic: Adrian Peterson (right) only learned that he was the biological father of Tyrese (left) two months before the boy's death, and the NFL star had never met the boy until he saw him in the hospital

News of Patterson's criminal past has already come out, but now his father is speaking out about how his son is handling the situation.

'He’s moving into a pissed-off stage now. He’s getting bitter,' Grant Patterson told The New York Daily News.

Outrageous: Patterson (left), who lived with Tyrese's mother Ann 'Ashley' Doohen (right), is said to be 'getting bitter' behind bars

His son was living with the boy's mother, Ann 'Ashley' Doohen, and he had a history of violence.

Patterson, 27, had a restraining order filed against him over his high school girlfriend in 2004.

Noell Uhlir filed a petition in order to get protection for her daughter Carlie Rae who was dating Joey at the time.

'I believe that Joey is mentally unstable, and it is only a matter of time before he harms himself, my daughter or anyone that may step in,' she wrote.

'Joey needs professional help.'

The second legal incident came in June 2012 when he was indicted for multiple counts of simple assault.

The victim in that situation was his then-girlfriend who has not been named and the 3-year-old son that the couple had together.

The girlfriend said that Patterson slapped their son on his bare butt causing him to need ice to calm the welts, and later Patterson attempted to strangle her and threatened her life.

Following incident, he violated the no-contact order that came in that case, and was due to spend a year in jail over the charges but that was ruled out by his agreement to attend domestic violence conseling.

The death of Tyrese last week was brought into the national spotlight as it was revealed that Minnesota Vikings player Adrian Peterson was actually the boy's biological father.

Peterson said he didn't know the child was his until about two months ago and had been working with the boy's mother to support the family financially.

'It was a difficult day, just taking in the circumstance and the whole situation,' Peterson said of Wednesday's funeral in Sioux Falls. 'A child was buried. That's difficult for anyone.

'I was planning on seeing him and I had talked with his mom and had gotten some things together as far as financially helping her. Unfortunately, this situation took place and it's devastating.

'A lot of people won't ever understand the situation that I'm in and see it the way I'm seeing the situation,' he said.

'It's tough, but I'm able to deal with that. I got a good supporting cast around me. I'm standing strong, I am.'
