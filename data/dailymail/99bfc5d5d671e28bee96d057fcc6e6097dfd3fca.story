A series of love letters sent from one of the first soldiers to die during the Battle of the Somme to his fiancee have been found in a dusty attic.

Private Frederick Bertram Key served with the 1/8th Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as part of the ‘pals battalions’ between 1914 to 1916.

He was killed at the age of 27 while fighting the German Empire during the bloody battle of the Somme, in France on July 1st, 1916 - the day the conflict began.

'My Darling Zen,' writes Private Frederick Key in a letter dated 16th May 1915 which has been found in an attic in a house in Hampshire along with 41  other letters and 15 post cards sent to Zen during his time serving in the British Army during World War I

During his time fighting World War I with the British Army he penned a series of moving letters to his wife-to-be Zen Hall from the front line.

In the hand-written notes he speaks of his hopes of returning to start their married life together to ‘live in a state of bread and cheese and kisses.’

He outlines his dreams of them owning a house in the English countryside with a nice garden where they ‘could take tea in the summer’ and tells her ‘it is sure to turn out well in the end.’

Tragically, in his last letter written just five months before his death he resigns himself to his fate ‘whatever that may be’ but reassures Zen if he dies ‘you will find me waiting for you in spirit’.

He signs off the final letter to his sweetheart declaring: ‘I love you my own sweet darling, with every fibre of my being, I just love you.’

Letters of hope: Private Key would write to his fiancee about the happy life they would lead together in a house in the countryside where they would 'take tea in the summer' once he was back from war

The remarkable letters were uncovered by a family in the attic of a house in Hampshire who are now selling them at auction in the centenary year of the start of WW1.

The series of 42 letters and 15 autographed postcards are expected to fetch between £500 and £800 when they go under the hammer on May 16.

Chris Albury, senior valuer and auctioneer at Dominic Winter Auctions, said: ‘Any letters from the front line are especially moving but these are so poignant.

‘You are clearly caught up in a beautiful love story, which ends tragically on the first day of the Battle of the Somme.

‘He remains aware of his own mortality and tackles the horror of war head on, while speaking about his hopes for their future. It really is heartbreaking.

‘It really is a case of being there by the grace of God and is a sobering reminder of what people sacrificed so we can live as we do now in Britain during 2014’

Pte Key, from Lichfield, Staffordshire had joined up along with his friends as one of the tragic ‘pals battalions’ sponsored by Dunlop - the company he worked for at the time.

The pals battalions were specially constituted battalions comprising men who had enlisted together in local recruiting drives, with the promise that they would be able to serve alongside their friends, neighbours and work colleagues.

Nine of the letters were sent to his beloved Zen while on training exercises in Essex between November 7, 1914 and March 21, 1915.

The rest were sent from the front line ‘somewhere in France’ as Pte Key and his friends battled the German war machine.

The letters begin in a light hearted 
manner, describing the first experiences of battle, but soon outline the
 true horror of the conflict.

On one occasion he wrote: ‘Many a time I have to clench myself to keep from running away into shelter.’

Writing in April 1915 he also describes having to duck for cover as the German's began to bombard the British trenches.

He said: ‘At 3 o'clock the Germans started to shell us, and hit the trench that I was in about 15 times.

‘So you bet that when they were doing that I began to fancy that I should never write it at all.

‘The trenches around here are on ground that is full of dead, and when there is any digging on it stinks something dreadfully.

‘You are not to worry about anything, it is sure to turn out well in the end and then D.V. we must have some good times together.’

While hopeful for the future each letter is sprinkled with the abbreviation DV, short for Deo volente, the latin for God Willing.

Talking of his future with Zen he added on August 29, 1915: ‘What a happy day that will be when we have a home of our own, I suppose that you would live with me in a state of bread and cheese and kisses, but not until I can afford to keep you.

‘No I won't say that, when we can live together in a style that at least you are used to, but I shall if I can manage it live in the country, it is much cheaper as regards rent etc. and a nice motor cycle & sidecar for us to take some enjoyable runs together and which I can go to business on.

‘How does that strike you, with a nice front garden and a big one at the back, with a lawn where could take tea in the Summer.

‘Well I only hope D.V. that all will come true.’

As the months of war stretched on Fred's thought of survival increasingly involved the prayers of those back home.

In
 January 1916 he wrote: ‘I am sure that if I do get out of this business
 safely, it will be mainly due to your and others applications to 
Providence for my safety.

'Cause
 although I do say my prayers as a rule regularly , I am sorry to say 
that it is only when I am near or in the trenches, 'cause spiritually 
& physically I am a coward, I shirk from bodily pain and many a time
 I have to clench myself to keep from running away into shelter.’

Tragic end: Pvt Key died as the 14th Royal Warwicks, pictured during the Battle of Guillemont, led the first charges of the Somme on July 1st, 1916 with the 1/8th battalion virtually wiped out in one go

Total heartbreak: Zen Hall's diary entry which reads 'My darling was mortally wounded by a machine gun bullet in 3rd German line. I didn't know until the 8th'

Pvt Key died as his regiment led the first charges of the Somme on July 1st, 1916.

Just after 7.30am over 600 men went over the top to be mown down by enemy gunfire with the 1/8th virtually wiped out in one go.

Fred's final heart wrenching letter in February 1916 writes of being parted from Zen and says: ‘Yes it is very nice to know that now I have met you, you will never be parted from me, except perhaps for a few short years.

‘I mean to say that when we are both defunct we have the satisfaction of knowing that we shall know and love one another more than ever and shall never be parted again, that is one of the things that make me resigned to my fate whatever it may be.

‘The parting would no doubt be long for you but very short to me, and you will find me waiting for you in spirit, still I hope that we shall live together on this earth many years yet, and that when the parting does come, it will be very short; I love you my own sweet darling, with every fibre of my being, I just love you.’

Along with the letters are two pencil sketches of a young woman, believed to be of Zen and her notebook, detailing their final meeting in December 1915.

Slipped inside that book is a telegram informing the family of Fred's death, retrospectively Zen wrote: ‘July 1st 1916. My darling was mortally wounded by a machine gun bullet in 3rd German line & I didn't know until the 8th’

On July 10 she adds ‘Letter came saying my darling killed....went to Lichfield’.

Following the tragic news she added: ‘And that is the last time I shall see him on this earth’.

The letters and postcards will go up for sale at Dominic Winter Auctions in Cirencester, Gloucestershire.
