More stores are expected to go bust following a Christmas that saw families tightening their belts and spending less money on the high street.

The warning comes from the British Retail Consortium against the background of the longest cost of living squeeze in a century.

With families cutting back over Christmas, the value of sales through bricks and mortar outlets in December dropped compared with last year.

Foreign factor: Experts said stores were boosted by customers from China and the Middle East. Shoppers are pictured on Boxing Day at Selfridges in London

The figure would have been even worse but for a last minute rush on the weekend before Christmas, with shoppers taking advantage of savage price cuts on gifts and clothes.

The total value of retail sales in the  crucial month of December rose by an ‘underwhelming’ 1.5 per cent.

But the experts said it was only the increase in online shopping – where sales rose 17.8 per cent on a year ago – that ensured total retail sales did not fall into the red.

The figures were revealed as the UK’s fourth largest supermarket, Morrisons, announced its Christmas sales were down by 2.5 per cent.

Customers switched to budget rivals, such as Aldi and Lidl, and internet shopping, which Morrisons does not offer.

The high street is facing an unprecedented squeeze as struggling families cut back on their spending and switch to shopping online.

Families battered by rising food and energy prices, which have outpaced increases in pay and pensions for four years, are making major lifestyle changes and are spending less and less on the high street.

Retail chains closed stores at a rate of 32 a day during last year in a dramatic escalation of the crisis turning many urban centres into ghost towns.

A number of household names – Comet, 
Peacocks, La Senza, Blacks, Game, Clinton Cards, and JJB Sports – all 
went into administration.

And the BRC say this trend is likely to continue into 2013.

It said half of all squeezed families – 51 per cent – intend to cut back on food spending over the next six months.

Sales of traditional toys fell this Christmas as youngsters switched to technology such as tablets and smartphones.

Money spent on toys that involve handling, building or the imagination were down by two per cent during 2012, according to the BRC.

It said: ‘Toys didn’t have the best Christmas ever. Some items like Lego were particularly trendy, but retailers reported a shift in the Christmas shopping pattern seeing interest for traditional toys and gifts replaced by more electronic items, tablets in particular.’ 

Traditionalists will rue the change in culture, for many technology based games involve solitary play, rather than groups, and leave little room for imagination.

Apart from tablets, such as the Apple iPads, Amazon Kindle series and Google Nexus, the BRC said there were strong sales for trendy earmuff style headphones.

It said department stores had a good Christmas and highlighted the huge influx of foreign tourists for the January sales, who were chasing designer handbags and shoes.

The BRC said: ‘A significant portion of the growth came from ‘export’ sales to customers from China, the Middle East and Nigeria.’

The figure rises to 67 per cent for 
parents with teenagers, who are finding it particularly tough to put 
food on the table while paying for other essentials.

It suggests Government pledges to tackle high street decline and the decision to hire ‘Queen of Shops’ Mary Portas to devise a rescue plan have little chance of success.

Miss Portas published an action plan last year calling for measures to make it easier to change shops to other uses, more free parking in towns and cuts in business rates.

Following her proposals, the Government announced that 15 towns would be given £100,000 each to resurrect their fortunes as part of a project that Miss Portas will feature in a new TV series.

But the scheme has been dismissed by critics.

Even Miss Portas has admitted that a number of high streets are beyond saving and town centres need to be switched to other uses such as housing, schools, gyms and community facilities.

BRC director general Helen Dickinson warned of tough times, saying: ‘During 2012, the number of shop failures went up by about 6 per cent on the previous year.

‘Looking into 2013, with a tough environment there is a risk that we are going to see more of the same.

‘Growth in sales is effectively flat once you strip out the changes in shop prices.

‘If you are operating in a low growth environment with costs you need to manage, that becomes more and more difficult.’

She said families do not have the cash to spend, which means there is little hope of any improvement.

‘If you look at the amount of money people have got in their pockets that is expected to continue to be under pressure. Consumers can’t create money out of nowhere,’ she said.

The BRC’s Retail Sales Monitor is compiled in partnership with accountants KPMG, whose head of retail, David McCorquodale, said: ‘While consumer confidence remains low, shoppers will tighten their belts and rein in their spending, making life difficult for the average retailer.

‘There will be no boom and it’s likely more than a few will go bust.’

Morrisons’ disappointing Christmas figures were driven by a shift in shopping habits towards budget stores.

The company also lost out because it does not have as many small convenience stores as rivals and is not selling groceries via the internet.

It is expected to make a move into online food sales later this year, while it has signed up Ant and Dec to front its advertising.
