Libya has revealed it needs urgent foreign help defeat Islamists in the country, as U.S. officials admitted they were 'caught off guard' by airstrikes carried out by the UAE.

Using bases in Egypt, Emirati warplanes secretly bombed targets in the Libyan capital Tripoli after the country's Islamist dominated General National Congress named a rival premier early last week.

A senior U.S. official was quoted as saying the America had not known anything about the airstrikes, in what appears to be a dramatic escalation in direct action by regional Arab states that have previously fought proxy wars in Libya.

As turmoil in Libya appeared to deepen, U.S. officials said jets from the United Arab Emirates' had launched two attacks in seven days on Islamists in Tripoli.

An Emirati official refused to comment on the allegations, saying only that his country had 'no reaction' to the report.

The air strikes signal a step towards direct action by regional Arab states that previously have fought proxy wars in Libya, Syria and Iraq in a struggle for power and influence.

The bombing raids were first reported by The New York Times, and Islamist forces in Libya had also alleged the strikes had taken place.

'The UAE carried out those strikes,' one American official said on condition of anonymity. When asked about the New York Times' account, another official added 'the report is accurate'.

Both officials admitted that the U.S. did not play any part in the airstrikes, but refused to say whether Washington had been deliberately left in the dark about Egypt and the UAE's involvement.

However, speaking to the BBC another senior official reportedly said America was caught 'off-guard' by the strikes, because it had not been consulted in any way about the possibility of military action.

The first strikes, on Monday last week, 
focused on militia targets in Tripoli - including a small weapons depot,
 according to the New York Times.

A second round south of the city early Saturday targeted rocket launchers, military vehicles and a warehouse.

Those strikes may have been a bid to 
prevent the capture of the airport, but the Islamist militia forces 
eventually prevailed anyway.

The UAE - which has spent billions 
on U.S.-made warplanes and advanced weaponry - provided the military 
aircraft, aerial refuelling planes and crews to bomb Libya, while Cairo 
offered access to its air bases, it was reported. Egypt has not publicly
 acknowledged any role in the air strikes.

Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates view Islamist militants as a serious threat to the region and have cooperated against what they see as a common danger.

News of the raids came after Libya's Islamist-dominated General National Congress threw down the gauntlet to the interim government by naming a premier-designate to form a rival administration.

Destruction: The Emirati airstrikes may have been a bid to prevent the capture of Tripoli airport, but the Islamist militia forces eventually prevailed anyway

The GNC, officially replaced earlier this month by a freshly elected parliament, selected pro-Islamist Omar al-Hassi to form a 'salvation government', a spokesman said.

'The GNC dismissed [interim premier] Abdullah al-Thani as head of government and gave Omar al-Hassi a week to form a salvation government,' Omar Ahmidan told journalists in Tripoli.

At the same time, Libya's new army chief Abdel Razzak Nadhuri declared 'war on terrorists' after parliament -Â  holed up 1,000 miles east of Tripoli in Tobruk - nominated him to tackle the unrest.

The GNC meeting, for its part, gave its backing to 'legitimate moves aimed at liberating the country,' Ahmidan said of the weekend capture of Tripoli airport by the Islamist coalition.

The airport seizure came after weeks of fighting between Islamists and the nationalist militia of Zintan in the west, which had controlled it since the overthrow in 2011 of long-time dictator Colonel Gaddafi.

The GNC - whose re-emergence plunges 
Libya's rocky political transition into fresh crisis - met following a 
request from the Islamists, who accused parliament of complicity in last 
week's air raids.

Thani has subsequenty rejected the GNC's decisions, branding the meeting 'illegal' and saying 'the only legislative body is parliament' during a televised news conference in Tobruk.

He also said Islamist militants had ransacked and torched his house in Tripoli last week.

Telling of 'threats, thefts and looting' in the capital, Thani said 'no public service can operate in these conditions.'

Parliament, elected in June, and Thani's government decamped to Tobruk after the army proved unable to restore law and order to Tripoli and Benghazi - Libya's two largest cities.

Fajr Libya, which translates as Libyan Dawn is a coalition of Islamist militias, mainly from Misrata, east of Tripoli.

The Ansar al-Sharia militant group, meanwhile, controls around 80 per cent of the city of Benghazi.

This morning Fajr Libya dismissed a call from Ansar al-Sharia for the two groups to unite under one banner, saying it rejects 'terrorism and extremism'.

But in a statement published by LANA news agency, it also accused parliament of violating constitutional legitimacy by calling for foreign intervention to solve the chaos gripping Libya.

The United States and its European allies yesterday strongly condemned the 'escalation of fighting and violence' in Libya, calling for a democratic transition.
