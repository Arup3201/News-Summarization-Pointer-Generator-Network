A New Mexico woman is accused of calling 9-1-1 to report that she saw a man with a gun walking into a convenience store on Sunday in a feeble attempt to get the police officer who had just pulled over she and her friends to turn his attention from them to the supposed gunman.

Unfortunately for 22-year-old Savana Jimenez, her plan backfired and she was arrested before the officers bothered to check on her bogus report.

According to authorities in Roswell, Jimenez and two friends were stopped Sunday morning for an unknown traffic violation. 

9-1-1: Savana Jimenez is accused of falsely reporting that a man with a gun was walking into a convenience store

When the three were pulled over, the officer who made the stop noticed that the woman in the passenger seat - Jimenez - was fiddling with her phone as the officer was checking out the information of the driver.

'The officer noticed that these three females in the vehicle were 
fidgety, acting kind of nervous and he saw one of them with a cellphone 
on her lap, Roswell Police Public Information Liaison Sabrina 
Morales told KRQE.

Busted: The officer noticed Jimenez playing with her phone when he stopped her and her friends

The call Jimenez allegedly made to 9-1-1 went as follows:

Dispatcher: 'Where’s your emergency?'

Suspect: 'Yes ma’am, I just saw a guy walk out with a gun at Allsups.'

Dispatcher: 'Ok. He went into the store and he was carrying a gun?'

Suspect: 'Yeah, he looked like he had one on the side and he was about to go in.'

Dispatcher: 'Ok. So you never actually saw the gun you just think he had one?'

Suspect: 'Bye.'

Dispatcher: 'Hello?'

Charges: Jimenez has been charged with obstruction. Her friends were not charged with any crimes

The officer - suspicious of the call to respond to a gunman at the convenience store - asked the dispatcher to trace the number of the person who reported the gunman.

'[Jimenez's] phone lit up like it was ringing,' said Morales. 'She tried to hide it to conceal the phone.'

Jimenez, authorities say, admitted that she made the story up in an attempt to get the officer to rush to the convenience store and leave her and her friends alone.

Jimenez was taken into custody and charged with obstruction.

The other two women in the vehicle were not charged with any crimes.
