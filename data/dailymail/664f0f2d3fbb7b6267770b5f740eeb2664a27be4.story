It began with Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow.  Now actress Kate Hudson, daughter of Goldie Hawn,  is the latest American star to set up home in the UK after buying an £11 million London townhouse with her British fiance.

The couple, who have a ten-month-old son, Bingham, paid cash for the Georgian home in an area where former residents include Sir Paul McCartney and Sienna Miller.

The six-bedroom property is set over six floors and boasts a home cinema, seven bathrooms, an indoor pool and an adjacent mews house worth £2.3 million. It had been on the market  for £13 million.

Scaffolding has  been erected from the basement up to the roof to begin extensive renovation.A neighbour said: ‘The scaffolding has gone up in the past two or three days. I don’t know who has bought it, but whoever it is must be very, very rich.’

Bellamy met Kate at the Coachella music festival in California in 2010. She also has an eight-year-old son, Ryder, by Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson.

Last night a spokesman for Bellamy declined to comment on the house.
