All players are expected to put in the hard yards nowadays but who has covered the most ground during a Barclays Premier League match this season?

Liverpool's 19-year-old flier Raheem Sterling, perhaps? Arsenal sprinter Alexis Sanchez? Or Manchester City workhorse James Milner, maybe? Guess again.

In fact, the player that has covered the most ground during a Premier League game this season is Burnley's George Boyd.

George Boyd has covered more distance than any other player in a Premier League match this season

The 29-year-old winger ran 8.29 miles against Stoke City on Saturday as Burnley won 2-1 at the Britannia

George Boyd – v Stoke – 8.29 miles

Gylfi Sigurdsson – v Man Utd – 8.19 miles

Gylfi Sigurdsson - v Burnley – 8.1 miles

George Boyd – v Hull City – 8.07 miles 

Morgan Schneiderlin - v Newc - 8.04 miles

Christian Eriksen – v Newc  – 8.01 miles

Mathieu Flamini – v Leicester – 7.98 miles

Dean Hammond – v Arsenal – 7.98 miles 

George Boyd – v West Ham – 7.95 miles

James Milner – v Aston Villa - 7.94 miles

The 29-year-old winger's work ethic is evident as he breaks into the top 10 distances covered this year on no less than three occasions.

They came against West Ham, former club Hull City and, most recently, in the 2-1 victory over Stoke at the Britannia on Saturday.

Boyd ran 8.29 miles during the crucial victory for the club sitting second bottom of the Premier League, although that rather fell under the radar with Danny Ings scoring twice.

Boyd ran 0.1 more miles than Swansea City's attacking midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson did against Manchester United in August, and 0.19 more than he did against Burnley a week later. 

Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen fall short of topping the list, though they have both managed to cover more than eight miles in a match.
