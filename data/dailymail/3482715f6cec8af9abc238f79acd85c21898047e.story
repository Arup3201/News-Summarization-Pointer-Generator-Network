A disgraced former police officer who quit the force and turned to a life of crime has been jailed for running a 'sophisticated' cannabis factory with a convicted killer.

Paul Lewsey, 50, spent 12 years as a 'highly respected' traffic officer with Lincolnshire Police before leaving on medical grounds and eventually turning to crime.

Lewsey has now been sentenced to more than three years in prison after his former colleagues found £150,000 worth of cannabis in the factory he was running with Simon Hopps - a man who had previously been jailed for manslaughter in 1994.

Lincoln Crown Court heard Lewsey was spotted carrying large containers of water into the factory, which the pair ran from a disused warehouse off the A631 in Hemswell.

Lewsey was jailed for three years and four months yesterday after he admitted producing a controlled drug between August 10 and September 23 2012.

Hopps, 38, was sentenced to 16 months in prison after admitting the same charge.

Sentencing Lewsey, Judge Sean Morris said: 'This was clearly a set-up that was meant to be there for a long time and to produce extremely large amounts of cannabis.

'I am quite satisfied you had a significant role in this. You had full awareness of the sheer scale of the operation,' the judge told Lewsey.

The court was told the factory was well hidden and could not be detected by specialist heat-seeking equipment typically used to track down cannabis farms.

But it was uncovered because the lack of a mains water supply meant hundreds of litres of water had to be transported to the site each day in order to maintain the plants.

Undercover police officers spotted Lewsey bringing in water in 25-litre containers on a daily basis.

When the building was raided officers found a sophisticated cannabis-growing operation divided into two rooms, the court heard.

It is thought the plants recovered from inside the factory, together with the remains of a recently harvested crop also found in the building, would have produced £150,000 worth of cannabis, the court was told.

Lewsey also used his own home as a nursery for young plants, and when police raided his property they found 117 seedlings waiting to be transferred to the site.

He served as a detective constable and as a traffic officer during his career with Lincolnshire Police, which began in 1986.

In August 2005 he was jailed for six years for supplying cocaine. Lewsey, a former detective constable, had been arrested after offering drugs to an undercover police officer he met in a pub.

Prosecutor Jeremy Janes said the cannabis plants found inside the building were capable of producing nearly 7kgs of the drug, while the remains of a recently cultivated crop in the adjoining room would have produced a further 8kgs. Barry Gilbert, defending, described Lewsey as having 'a chequered past'.

A former colleague of Lewsey's said yesterday: 'I worked with Paul for many years and he was a good officer, highly respected and thorough.

'Somewhere along the line he must have flipped and went over to the other side. It's very sad.'
