Navy veteran who served on Arctic convoys takes on airline over 'insulting' £60 to carry military standard

A Second World War veteran, who accused a budget airline of insulting the memory of his fallen comrades, has won a battle over baggage.

Royal Navy veteran Alec Penstone, 86, was charged £60 to take a ceremonial standard on a Flybe flight to attend Jersey's Liberation Day parade.

The veteran branded the fee disgusting and pursued his fight with the budget airline until it conceded it was in the wrong and amended its policy.

In his letter to management Mr Penstone said: 'Without my generation of men and women and what we fought for, your aircraft would be carrying the Nazi Swastika on the wings and tail fin.'

Victorious: Mr Penstone was 'insulted' by the charge to take his standard on the flight

Two other veterans were forced to abandon their company standards at Exeter Airport because they could not afford the fee, heaped on top of normal baggage charges made by the airline.

Outraged Mr Penstone took his fight to Flybe management, but was told by the 
complaints department the cost was correct.

Undaunted, he fought on and has now earned victory in the shape of a new Flybe policy on military regalia.

Mr Penstone, 86, served with the Royal Navy as a submarine detector, protecting vital cargo ships crossing the Arctic and North Sea.

Sky high charges: The airline has changed its policy after Mr Penstone's complaint

Almost 70 years on, he found himself locked in the battle over what he described as a disgusting attempt to charge him to fly with his 2.5kg, 4ft 6in Royal Naval Association standard to the Jersey memorial service.

He said: 'I felt it was completely unjustified.

'I have taken the standard to Murmansk, America, Malta, Jersey and Australia to attend parades and memorials for the last 22 years, and have never been charged extra.

'I was not fighting for reimbursement, rather a change in company policy. I think to charge for something like this was disgusting and an insult.'

Following the victory Mr Penstone said: 'This is fantastic news.'

A Flybe spokesman said: 'The charge applied to Mr Penstone at the airport was correct and in line with Flybe policy for the carriage of non-standard items in the hold.

'However Flybe fully appreciates that such a valued oversize item of military regalia needs to be carried to special events and so would like to thank him for bringing this anomaly to its attention.

'As a result Flybe is amending its rules of carriage charges to in future allow one item of military regalia to be included within the 20kg baggage allowance.

'As a gesture of goodwill Flybe will be pleased to reimburse Mr Penstone with the £60 he was charged.'
