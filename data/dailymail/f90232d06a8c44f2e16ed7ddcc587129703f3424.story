For many, the news will never sound the same again.

Four of the BBC’s best-loved voices are to depart amid the corporation’s budget cuts.

Radio 4 has revealed that Charlotte Green and Harriet Cass – two of its longest-serving announcers – are taking voluntary redundancy, while Radio 2 confirmed that newsreaders Fran Godfrey and Fenella Fudge will also leave at the end of the year.

The broadcaster is cutting back on 
its radio staff as part of the Delivering Quality First initiative, 
which states that most departments must make savings of 20 per cent. It 
is reducing its continuity team and combining news teams across 
stations.

Miss Green, 56, and Miss Cass, 60, 
are the longest-serving announcers on Radio 4, and have 74 years of BBC 
service between them. They have been an integral part of the station 
since the Seventies and have read the news for the Today programme, 
introduced shows, and spoken to sailors and insomniacs alike via the 
Shipping Forecast.

Miss Cass joined the corporation in 
1972 and made her name editing Today In Parliament and reporting on 
politics, before being made a senior announcer.

She once described Radio 4 as her 
‘spiritual home’, but said of her departure after 40 years of service: 
‘It is time to do other things.’

Miss Green – voted the Most 
Attractive Female Voice on the Radio in a Radio Times poll  – joined the
BBC in 1978 as a studio manager. After reading out letters on PM and 
You And Yours she was made a continuity announcer and newsreader in the 
early Eighties.

In 2008 she famously dissolved into giggles while reading an  item about the death of screenwriter Abby Mann.

As Radio 4 has broadened its range of
voices with the likes of Jamaican-born Neil Nunes and Northern 
Ireland’s Kathy Clugston, traditionalists have rallied around Miss 
Green’s Received Pronunciation.

‘Radio 4 listeners have always been very warm and appreciative of what I have done,’ she said.

‘I will miss the buzz of live projects but I am really looking forward to getting involved in new projects.'

Radio 2 star Miss Godfrey, 59, has opted for voluntary redundancy 22 years after joining the BBC.

She enjoyed huge success while working on Sir Terry Wogan’s hit breakfast show.

Miss Fudge joined the BBC as a trainee straight from school. She will also leave at the end of the year.

Bob Shennan, controller of Radio 2, 
said: ‘After long and successful careers with the BBC, Fenella and Fran 
have chosen to move on and I personally will miss them, as I’m sure our 
listeners will.

‘I’d like to thank them both and wish them all the best for the future.’

Long-serving freelance newsreaders Ricky Salmon, Colin Berry and Charles Nove will also be phased out.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘There will be 
one news and continuity teams for Radio 2 and 6 Music made up of 12 
people – six men and six women. We will use freelancers as and when they
are needed.’
