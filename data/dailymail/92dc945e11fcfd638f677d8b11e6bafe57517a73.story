NHS boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham wrongly told one man that he was the father of her three-month-old daughter by sending him the wrong DNA result.

The 24-year-old asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father - and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day.

But the mother-of-three, who has recently been photographed with new boyfriend Andrew Goy, mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man.

New man: Josie Cunninhgam, pictured in Leeds with her new boyfriend two weeks ago, asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father. She sent the positive result to the wrong man

Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders.

She posted: 'What an absolute f*** up! Put the wrong DNA results in the wrong envelope then had to tell the guy who thought he was the father he wasn't!'

She added: 'My life actually feels like an episode of Eastenders, Whys nothing simple!?!?'

The mother-of-three shot to notoriety when she boasted about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS and then threatened to have an abortion so she could appear in Big Brother. 

She had previously told the Daily Mirror that she thought the Christmas Day paternity test revelation would be a 'nice surprise' for her daughter's father.

The wannabe model from Leeds, West Yorkshire, also claimed that she would change her mobile number and only the card being posted to Grace's father would contain her new one.

At one point, the former glamour model thought the child's father could be Hull City captain Curtis Davis, but it was later revealed that she had been duped.

The man, who she began sleeping with after meeting him at a Leicester hotel in April last year, had allegedly told her he was the £2.2million central defender.

Friends had warned her it might not be him but she still fell for it, even after searching for pictures of the real footballer on Google.

Writing on Twitter at the time she said: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer.'

The other two contenders for the possible father include a surgeon she slept with whilst working as a £1,000-a-night prostitute and her best friend's boyfriend.

She has split the cost of the £300 DNA test between two of the men, with the footballer impostor refusing to give a sample, and says if they aren't the father they will get their money back. 

Miss Cunnigham was seen two weeks ago walking through Leeds with her new boyfriend, named by a source this as Andrew Goy, pushing a pink pram and holding coffee cups.

Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

She later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

She made headlines again when she said she now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. 

Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.

Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job.

Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery.

But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. 

The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy.

She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'.

Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child.

Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000.

It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.
