An amateur photographer has captured stunningly beautiful images of one of nature's finest fishermen at work.

Phiphat Suwanmon, an amateur Thai photographer, spent two years photographing the blue-eared kingfisher in an attempt to document its extraordinary feeding habits.

His striking photographs show a family of kingfishers diving into water to hunt.

The blue-eared kingfisher is found in Asia - across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia in countries including Nepal, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Thailand.

It is mainly found in dense forests where it hunts in streams.

It is 16cm long and is almost identical to the common kingfisher except for its blue ear coverts and darker cobalt blue upper parts.

It hunts crustaceans, dragonfly larvae and fish.

The birds are so rare that many experts are awestruck that an amateur photographer managed to take the pictures at all.

Mr Suwanmon said: ‘It was important to allow the birds to see me often and build up trust in order to allow me to take their pictures while they act naturally - not an easy feat to get wild birds to do.

‘I spent ages among the birds and had to be extremely patient but I finally got to take pictures of this wonderful bird doing what it does best.’

The 33-year-old roped in his family to help him create a hide in the birds’ habitat in Thailand's southern province, Satun.

After studying the animals' natural mating, feeding and living cycle the family built a studio within the wilderness and created a new feeding pond for the birds to fish in.

The photographer then encouraged the birds to continue their natural hunting while he shot exceptional pictures.

Mr Suwanmon said: 'It was important to allow the birds to see me often and build up trust in order to allow me to take their pictures while they act naturally - not an easy feat to get wild birds to do'

He said: ‘It takes them about one second to catch a fish.

'They move so quickly that I had to try a variety of different methods to get the best shot.

‘But the pictures are definitely worth the hard work.’

Mr Suwanmon’s work has created a storm among wildlife photographers as admirers express their amazement of the high-quality work.

He is now hoping to use his gallery as a platform to propel Thailand to the forefront of natural world photography.

He said: ‘A lot of people said this is the first time they'd seen pictures of this quality and expected that they'd really been taken by a non-Thai photographer.

‘Hopefully this is only the start of the development of taking quality pictures, and I plan to take further series in the years ahead.’

Blue-eared kingfishers are found across Asia and tend to live in shady forests where they hunt for fish in streams
