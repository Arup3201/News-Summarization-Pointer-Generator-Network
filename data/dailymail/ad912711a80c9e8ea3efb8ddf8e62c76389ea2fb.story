Christmas is a time of love and joy, festive cheer and peace on earth.

But not, it seems, for Serbian footballer Aleksandar Kolarov.

The Manchester City defender has given fans his own special dark Christmas message complete with a rendition of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town that is, you have to say, rather chilling.

As a background for the video, he asked for darkness, wolves and the Serbian flag. And then he sung, in a very gruff Serbian accent.

Stage is set: Kolarov requested a Christmas tree with the Serbian flag on top along with some wolves to set the mood for his song

Warning: Kolarov makes it clear that he will be coming to town

Festive cheer: Kolarov cracks a smile after singing an unforgettable version of a Christmas classic

Kolarov is best known for his 
unstoppable free kicks and his attempt at singing the Christmas classic,
 made famous by Mariah Carey, cannot be missed.

Last year his version of Jingle Bells was such a hit with City fans that all the stops were pulled out to make
 sure the 28-year-old repeated his Christmas message.

Kolarov has been busy in the run up to Christmas joining teammate James Milner in lending a hand to the Key 103 Mission Christmas appeal by preparing some toys to send to the 150,000 children in Manchester in poverty.

His team take on Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on Boxing Day in a vital clash at the top of the table.
