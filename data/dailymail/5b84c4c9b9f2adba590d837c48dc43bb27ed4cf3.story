Most children are told not to pick their noses in public, but a company in Japan has produced a rubber nose for people to use as a polite prop when they have the urge to pick.

The $2 rubber noses are sold in vending machines in Japan and are made by Bandai.

The hojirerun desu, which translates as 'pickable nose' comes in two colours and four shapes to suit customers' picking preferences and even makes a noise when the user removes their finger from the faux nostrils.

The noses come in a beige colour as well as clear for those who enjoy the voyeuristic experience of nose picking and make a 'suction-pop noise' at the end of a session, Medical Daily reported.

The four shapes include 'regular', 'wild nose', 'beauty nose' and 'idols nose' with one model including a 'rare secret' of fake nasal mucus for users to extract.

It is not known why the company has chosen to roll out the bizarre product, but a previous scientific study has reported that the act as rhinotillexis (or nose picking) is good for humans.

Some researchers believe humans pick their noses several times a day but that the ingestion of nasal mucus could actually boost the immune system, which means a fake nose cannot replace the benefits.

In a bid to unpick the health benefits of rhinotillexis, Professor Scott Napper asked pupils to eat their mucus after picking in a bid to understand the immune system.

The Canadian academic believes eating mucous in the nose - which contains a cocktail of antiseptic enzymes - may boost the immune system by introducing small and harmless amounts of germs back into the body.

His theory follows others that suggest improved hygiene has led to an increase in allergies and auto-immune disorders.

The associate professor of biochemistry at the University of Saskatchewan is a firm believer in the powers of picking your nose.

He said: ‘Nature pushes us to do different things because it is to our advantage to have certain behaviours, to consume different types of foods.

'So maybe when you have an urge like this to pick your nose and eat it, you should just go with nature.’

Experts such as Dr Hilary Longhurst, consultant immunologist from the Bart’s NHS Trust, believe a similar thing occurs when we bite our nails.

‘Unless your hands are filthy, the bugs we encounter when biting our nails could boost our immune system,' she said.

The immune system works by developing a 'memory' and making a note of how to fight each bug it has ever encountered.

When a bug is encountered a second time, the immune system reaches into its 'memory' and releases weapons — called memory lymphocytes — that know how to kill it.
