Colombian pop singer Shakira will make her third consecutive World Cup appearance at the closing ceremony in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium before the final match on July 13.

Shakira will perform her song "La La La (Brazil 2014)" alongside Brazilian percussionist and singer Carlinhos Brown.

'I have an intricate relationship with football for obvious reasons, and I truly understand what the World Cup means to so many people, myself included,' said Shakira, who is the partner of Barcelona and Spain star Gerard Pique.

The closing ceremony will also feature a samba performance from one of the Rio de Janeiro schools that participate in the city's famous Carnival celebrations.
