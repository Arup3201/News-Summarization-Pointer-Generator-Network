Danny Rose was forced to pull out on Wednesday because of hip and hamstring problems. Rose had been carrying the injury but was keen to represent his country. He tried to train but found it uncomfortable and a decision was made that he should return to his club.

Pochettino waited until the cameras had left the training session before he strolled out to watch.

It presents the perfect opportunity for the Spurs boss to discuss with Hodgson the best plan for Kane at the end of the season.

Kane will join Tottenham for a friendly game in Australia and there are plans unfolding for a second match possibly in Malaysia.

Pochettino would also like home to enjoy a month without competitive football but England would like him to play in the European U21 Championships in the Czech Republic.
